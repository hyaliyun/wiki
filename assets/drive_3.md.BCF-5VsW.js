He was suspended twice for using performance-enhancing drugs. ==High school career== Byrd is a 1995 graduate of Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia, and won All-State honors in baseball and football. He played on the 1993 state runner-up team as a sophomore, and was part of the 1995 state championship team. ==College career== Byrd began his college baseball career at Georgia Tech. As a sophomore in 1996, after experiencing discomfort in his leg, Byrd was diagnosed with an infection in his tibialis anterior muscle, the largest muscle in the lower leg. After considering amputation, doctors chose to perform surgery to remove the muscle entirely. Between Thanksgiving in 1996 and January 1997, Byrd underwent a total of three operations. He spent nearly two years rehabbing the injury, during which time his body weight rose from 225 to 315 pounds. He shed the weight by approximating a bodybuilder diet and then enrolled at Georgia Perimeter College where he played his final season of college baseball in 1999. ==Major league career== ===Philadelphia Phillies=== Byrd reached the major leagues in 2003. He came in fourth in the Rookie of the Year voting, batting .303 with 86 runs scored, 28 doubles, four triples, seven home runs and 11 stolen bases in 135 games and 495 at-bats. During his rookie season, Byrd and the team were sued by a fan who suffered a concussion from a ball that Byrd threw into the stands as a souvenir after making the last out of an inning. Both he and the team were granted summary judgement in their favor by the trial court, but the plaintiff appealed. A three-judge panel of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania heard the case, and two of the judges affirmed the judgement, holding that while such gifts to the fans are not part of gameplay, they are a common enough aspect of baseball games today that the Baseball Rule, which limits teams' liability to spectators injured by foul balls, applied to Byrd's throw as well. \\"I do not doubt that Marlon Byrd threw the ball that hit [a]ppellant without malicious intent,\\" wrote the dissenting justice, John Bender. \\"[But] if a baseball player wants to go beyond the confines of the game and provide a gratuitous souvenir to a fan, he should be charged with the obligation of doing it in a reasonably safe and prudent manner. Here, there is certainly evidence from which a factfinder might conclude that the manner in which Byrd threw the ball into the stands was imprudent.\\" Bender said a jury should have been allowed to decide that question.Loughran, 877‚Äì82 ===Washington Nationals=== Byrd was traded to the Washington Nationals in 2005 for Endy Ch√°vez. On July 15, 2006, Byrd was designated for assignment and assigned to Washington's Triple-A affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs.  Texas Rangers in 2009 Byrd was signed as a free agent by the Rangers on December 8, 2006, to compete for the starting position in center field. After failing to make the Rangers' major league roster out of spring training, Byrd was assigned to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks. Byrd's contract was purchased on May 26, 2007, following injuries to outfielders Brad Wilkerson and Jerry Hairston, Jr. Making the most of his call-up by hitting over .400 for the month of June, Byrd played his way into the line-up, allowing the Rangers to trade center fielder Kenny Lofton prior to the trading deadline. On August 4, 2008, he hit a walk-off grand slam to help the Rangers beat the Yankees 9‚Äì5. Byrd had a career season in 2009, hitting 20 home runs and collecting 89 RBIs.

He was selected for his first All-Star Game. Byrd entered the game as a substitute and drew a walk off of Matt Thornton. He scored from first base on a double by Brian McCann. In the ninth inning, while playing right field, Byrd made an outstanding play, forcing Boston DH David Ortiz at second after fielding what normally would have been a base hit. On May 21, 2011, while batting during the 2nd inning of a game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Byrd was hit near his left eye by a pitch from Red Sox pitcher Alfredo Aceves. The pitch was, according to Aceves, unintentional. After the pitch hit him, Byrd dropped to the ground, covered the area by his left eye and rolled in pain; he was helped off the field by Cubs medical personnel and taken to the trainer's room in the clubhouse. Byrd did not return to the game. He was taken to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he stayed overnight to be examined. The incident marked the fifth time that Byrd had been hit by a pitch in a ten-day period. Byrd was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day. Justin Berg was called up to take his place.

He later served as head coach of the Kings before spending 30 years with the Chicago Blackhawks as a coach or executive. ==Early life== Pulford and his family lived on King St. in Weston, Ontario from 1940 to 1950, and he attended Memorial School prior to the family move to rural Ontario. Pulford played junior hockey in Weston, then senior hockey for the Marlboros. ==Playing career== Pulford played junior hockey for the Toronto Marlboros for three seasons from 1953 to 1956, winning two Memorial Cups under coach Turk Broda. He moved up to the Maple Leafs for the 1956‚Äì57 season and remained with the team for 14 seasons wearing jersey number 20. Pulford was an important member of the Leaf teams that won four Stanley Cups in 1962-1964 and 1967. With the series tied 1‚Äì1, Pulford scored the overtime game winner in game 3 of the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. The Montreal goalie was Rogie Vachon. Pulford later coached Vachon in Los Angeles as the Kings rose to prominence in the mid-1970s. The Leafs traded him to the Los Angeles Kings on September 3, 1970, where he played two seasons and retired as a player in 1972. In 1967 Pulford was elected the first president of the National Hockey League Players' Association. ==Coaching career== Immediately after retiring as a player, Pulford became head coach of the Kings for the 1972‚Äì73 season and led the team for five years before becoming coach and general manager of the Chicago Blackhawks in 1977. As coach of the Kings, he helped Los Angeles go from being one of the worst defensive and penalty killing teams in the NHL to one of the best. He guided the Kings to their first playoff appearance in five years in 1974, and won the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in the NHL in 1975. That season, the Kings amassed 105 points, still a club record through 2013. He also led the Kings to their first playoff series wins since 1969 when they defeated the Atlanta Flames in the first round of both the 1976 and 1977 NHL playoffs. Pulford left the Kings after the 1976‚Äì77 season after constant feuding with then owner Jack Kent Cooke. Pulford wanted to become General Manager as well as coach, or at least have a bigger role in player personnel decisions. Cooke however, often meddled in player personnel matters, and in the mid-1970s, reverted to his old habits of trading promising young players and draft picks for veteran, past their prime former stars. He served as coach for the Blackhawks on three separate occasions from 1977 to 1987. He was promoted to senior vice president in 1990, but took on the general manager's duties again from 1992 to 1997, from 1999 to 2000, and from 2003 to 2005. During his third stint as general manager, Pulford nominally doubled as head coach, demoting Lorne Molleken to an assistant. However, Molleken remained the team's main operator on the bench, with Pulford as more or less a senior consultant. In seven seasons and 426 games as Hawks coach over three stints, Pulford won 182, lost 176, and tied 68. At the time he left the bench for good, only Billy Reay had won more regular season games for the Hawks. Pulford is now third, behind Reay and Joel Quenneville for most regular season games won as Hawk coach. He won the Jack Adams Award for best coach in the NHL in 1975. Pulford was also honoured to be named head coach of Team USA during the 1976 Canada Cup tournament. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. On October 11, 2007, Pulford was named an officer with the Wirtz Corporation, parent company of the Blackhawks, and is no longer part of the day-to-day management of the Blackhawks. His son-in-law is Dean Lombardi, a former assistant general manager for the Minnesota North Stars, GM of the San Jose Sharks, and president and general manager of the Los Angeles Kings. He is currently a senior advisor in the Philadelphia Flyers organization.

Black Emperor and Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra. Menuck is also a frequent record producer and engineer, working with musicians from Montreal and abroad. ==Biography== Menuck was born in Montreal but grew up primarily in Toronto. He moved back to Montreal when he was in his early 20s. His father was a doctor and his mother was a nurse. He attended Hebrew day school from first to ninth grade. After dropping out of high school in 11th grade, Menuck was homeless and jobless and had a nervous breakdown at age 20. Menuck has mentioned that as a teenager he once lived in a flooded basement with \\"two other lost kids\\" and \\"a litter of feral kittens, and that all were unfed\\". In 1994, Mauro Pezzente, Mike Moya, and Menuck founded Godspeed You! Black Emperor, an influential instrumental rock ensemble. Their first album, All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling, is the earliest recorded document of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Self-released in December 1994, the cassette was dubbed only 33 times. It was not until the release of their official debut album, F‚ôØ A‚ôØ ‚àû, that they began receiving recognition for their work. Menuck is also responsible for the creation of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra- La-La Band, along with fellow Godspeed You! Black Emperor alumni Sophie Trudeau and Thierry Amar. Originally conceived as an aid to Menuck in learning how to score music, the group has since blossomed into a regular collaboration. When He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corner of Our Rooms... debuted, it was notable in that it included vocals by Menuck and his band mates; this was in contrast with the taciturn Godspeed You! Black Emperor. However, Constellation states on the biography for Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band that Menuck did in fact sing vocals before the creation of the group on a \\"rare 1996 GYBE cassette release\\". While the music of Godspeed You! Black Emperor was marked by its sampling and symphonic development, Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band more regularly incorporated lyrics as well. Menuck confessed to being at odds with the role of the singer in bands, noting that lyricists are often featured as the main attraction at the expense of their bands. He also felt uncomfortable with his own singing, but has since overcome that feeling. Menuck often shares vocal duty with all the other members of A Silver Mt. Zion. The lyrical style of Menuck is best described as poetic. The topics of his lyrics range from the fear and loneliness experienced while driving alone on an American highway at night to urban decay, and even a tribute to a deceased pet dog. Indeed, \\"This Is Our Punk-Rock,\\" Thee Rusted Satellites Gather + Sing, the third album by Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, was essentially created as a requiem for open and abandoned spaces in Montreal, as well as for similar loss and decay around the world, due to either urban development or military action. Menuck is also known for integrating politics into song titles, lyrics, and album cover art for A Silver Mt. Zion. As such, references to anarchism and anti-war viewpoints are often expressed. (In an April 2014 interview with The Rumpus, Menuck identified as an anarchist.) Menuck in 2019 While Menuck sometimes utilizes religious imagery in the lyrics and albums of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, and described the recording sessions of He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corner of Our Rooms... a \\"Jewish experience\\", he does not consider himself an adherent of the Jewish faith, quoted in one source as saying \\"I don't go to synagogue, I don't believe that there's a God in heaven, I don't believe in any of that stuff\\". With the title of Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward, the band references the Book of Job Ch. 5:7. Menuck has been an outspoken critic of the Israeli government; the liner notes for Yanqui U.X.O. criticize Ariel Sharon's 2000 visit to the Temple Mount. Along with Howard Bilerman, Radwan Moumneh and Thierry Amar, Menuck owns and operates the Hotel2Tango, a loft space that acts as a practice area, recording studio, and one of the very few non-commercial venues in Montreal capable of accommodating live concerts. The studio was originally confined to the recordings of friends and the bands of the people who own it, but has of late opened its doors to a multitude of other bands. In 2006, Menuck, with Sophie Trudeau and Thierry Amar, assisted in the recording of Carla Bozulich's first release for Constellation Records, Evangelista. On August 5, 2009, Silver Mt. Zion violinist Jessica Moss gave birth to her and Menuck's baby. The couple took him on tour with Vic Chesnutt. Menuck's first official solo project was released via Constellation Records on May 24, 2011. The album is entitled Plays \\"High Gospel\\". His second solo album titled Pissing Stars was released on February 2, 2018. Pissing Stars was also released on Constellation Records. ==Musical equipment== The following is a list of musical equipment used by Efrim Menuck. ===Guitars=== * Gibson Les Paul - Gold Top * Fender Jaguar ‚Äì Sunburst, modified with a humbucker in the neck position and a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece * Travis Bean * Mosrite 'The Ventures' Mach 1 (A Silver Mt Zion) * Gibson ES-225 (A Silver Mt Zion) ===Amplifiers=== * Ampeg V4 head * Mesa/Boogie Rectifier Trem-O-Verb head * Fender Dual Showman ===Misc=== * Screwdriver ==Discography== ===Godspeed You!

He played in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, Edmonton Oilers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Los Angeles Kings, and the Pittsburgh Penguins. He also played part of a season with the IHL Cleveland Lumberjacks and two seasons in the Czech league. ==Early career and defection== By the time Kl√≠ma was 20 years old, officials on his Dukla Jihlava team knew that the Detroit Red Wings were eager to bring the young star to the NHL. Rumors were rampant that the Wings were trying to pay off Czechoslovak authorities to get Kl√≠ma out of his native country, but despite all the hype that surrounded him, Czechoslovak hockey authorities made no real effort to clamp down and prevent Kl√≠ma from traveling in Europe. As a result, Kl√≠ma managed to defect to North America during the summer of 1985, making him the first Czech player to defect directly to a U.S.-based team rather than one of the NHL's Canadian teams which had smuggled several Czechs and Slovaks out of Europe in the past. Klima's bold move was entirely orchestrated by the Red Wings, who knew that Kl√≠ma was eager to play in North America. After his defection was planned, Kl√≠ma ditched his Czechoslovak national teammates during a team meal at the Czechoslovak training camp in Nu√üdorf am Inn, West Germany, to join Wings executive vice-president Jim Lites and assistant coach Nick Polano at an undisclosed location on Aug 18, 1985. Several days were then spent in the effort to bring Kl√≠ma to North America, after Lites and Polano, who had flown to Germany on Aug 15, 1985, kept Kl√≠ma under wraps in Nussdorf and other cities to avoid pursuit by Czechoslovak police. Polano stayed with Kl√≠ma as Lites and other Wings officials arranged for him to gain refugee status to enter the United States. The Wings were assisted by U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese and deputy attorney general Lowell Jensen in expediting the political-asylum process. It was later revealed that plans to get Kl√≠ma out of Czechoslovakia reached back as far as the 1984 World Junior Championships, held in Sweden, when Detroit scout Alex Davidson secretly met with Kl√≠ma in December 1983. Kl√≠ma told Davidson he would not consider defecting until he had completed his military duty (so as not to be labeled a deserter) in 1985. Less than a year later, at the 1984 Canada Cup, Kl√≠ma began talking to the Wings about the possibility of coming to the NHL after the 1984‚Äì85 season. During that time, while in Vancouver with the Czechoslovak team, he even signed a secret multiyear contract with the Red Wings. Polano had brought the contract to Kl√≠ma without Czechoslovak officials realizing it. Kl√≠ma, who spoke no English when he finally arrived in Detroit on Sep 22, 1985, was fortunate that the Red Wings also managed to bring his girlfriend to the U.S. In honor of his successful defection, a grateful and overjoyed Kl√≠ma requested sweater number 85 and wore it throughout his NHL career as a reminder of the year in which he gained freedom. Kl√≠ma was drafted in the fifth round (88th overall) of the 1983 NHL Entry Draft by the Red Wings. He played his junior hockey with the CHZ Litvinov team. Klima at Hockey Draft Central. ==NHL playing career== Kl√≠ma played four full seasons with the Wings (from 1985 until 1989) before being traded to the Oilers (along with Joe Murphy and Adam Graves) during the 1989‚Äì90 season. He scored the game-winning goal in the longest Stanley Cup Finals game in history, the third overtime of Game 1 of the 1990 Finals against Andy Moog of the Boston Bruins despite having not played at all in the third period, nor the first two OT periods. He played for the Oilers until 1993, winning the Stanley Cup in 1990. In 1993 Klima was acquired by the Lightning. Kl√≠ma remained with the Lightning for three seasons, until 1996. He split the 1996‚Äì97 season between the Lumberjacks, Kings, Penguins, and Oilers, and was released in 1997. He played in the DEL in 1997‚Äì98, then attempted a comeback with the Red Wings in 1998. He retired from the NHL in 1999, and then played two seasons in years 2001‚Äì2003 in the Czech league before retiring for good. He played for Litvinov and captained those 2 years. Asked which jersey number he wanted to wear, Kl√≠ma chose the number 85 in recognition of the year of his defection and his first year in the NHL. ==Kl√≠ma's disciplinary woes== Although he was one of Detroit's bigger stars in the late 1980s, Petr Kl√≠ma was also a problem for the Red Wings management. That situation came to a head during training camp on Sep 23, 1988, when Detroit suspended Kl√≠ma indefinitely, along with Bob Probert, for breaking team rules. At the time of the suspension, the Wings said they would trade Kl√≠ma, although this never happened. The team also said it would not take Kl√≠ma back until he had his drinking under control. As a result, Kl√≠ma missed the start of the 1988‚Äì89 season before being reinstated on Oct. 13, 1988, and sent to Adirondack (AHL) on Oct 16, 1988. He finally made his 1988‚Äì89 NHL regular-season debut during Detroit's Nov 6, 1988, game vs. Edmonton where he posted an assist. At his first practice with the team, on Nov 5, 1988, Kl√≠ma offered a heartfelt apology to his Wings teammates for his earlier behavior, much of which was alcohol-related. During his months back, Kl√≠ma roomed with Probert, who was also trying to cope with his drinking and drug habits. Kl√≠ma managed to stay clean, but Probert's substance abuse and subsequent issues would continue for several years. ==Personal life== Kl√≠ma's sons are also professional ice hockey players.

He was the second son of thirteen children born to Rachel (n√©e Cox) Stevens and Colonel John Stevens III. His siblings included older brother John Cox Stevens, the first commodore of the New York Yacht Club, and younger brother Edwin Augustus Stevens, who founded the Stevens Institute of Technology. His paternal grandparents were John Stevens Jr., a prominent New Jersey politician who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and Elizabeth (n√©e Alexander) Stevens, who was the daughter of James Alexander, the Attorney General of New Jersey, and Mary (n√©e Spratt) Provoost Alexander, a prominent merchant. His aunt Mary Stevens married Robert R. Livingston, the first Chancellor of the State of New York. ==Career== 1834 stock certificate of the \\"Joint Companies\\" signed by Robert L. Stevens In 1807, the Stevens and their father built the Ph≈ìnix, a steamboat which became the first to navigate the ocean successfully when she traveled from New York City to the Delaware River in 1809. The Ph≈ìnix could not operate in the harbor at New York City because Robert Fulton and his partner Robert Livingston, the U.S. Minister to France, had obtained a monopoly there. Robert Stevens applied the wave line, concave waterlines on a steamboat hull, in 1808, as well as other improvements to shipbuilding. He and his brother, James, involved with the passenger steamship business on the Hudson River in 1834, and both were members of the Hudson River Steamboat Association, a cartel which sought a monopoly on passenger traffic between New York City and Albany. Stevens was president of the Camden and Amboy Railroad (C&A;) in the 1830s and 1840s. When the John Bull steam locomotive arrived on the C&A; property, it was originally named Stevens in his honor. Although his father is occasionally credited with the invention of the flanged T rail for railways, Robert Stevens at 42 is considered to have been the inventor of the first all- iron rail construction of the Camden & Amboy. Before 1831, the rails of all previous American railroads were strap iron rails made of wood with a metal strap applied to the wood. One of the two men had traveled to England to purchase the new rails since there was no rolling mill in the United States that was capable of producing the rails. The flat bottomed rail profile is used by railways of every nation. It replaced the cast-iron edge rails that had been introduced in England in 1789, which were made without flanges; instead, flanges were placed on the wheels. (The flanged T rail was introduced in England in 1836 by engineer Charles B. Vignoles (1793-1875), therefore the term \\"Vignoles rails\\" came into use in Europe). He invented a percussion shell, the rights to which he sold to the government. In 1842, he was commissioned by the government to build the first ironclad warship ever constructed, but he died without ever completing it. Stevens, who never married, died in Hoboken on April 20, 1856. == References == ==For further reading== * Today in Science History: October 18.

Gengenbach is well known for its traditional Alemanic \\"fasnacht\\", (\\"Fasend\\"), a kind of historically influenced celebration of carnival, where tradition is followed, from wearing costumes with carved wooden masks to clapping with a \\"Ratsche\\" (a traditional-classic wooden \\"sound-producing\\" toy). Gengenbach also boasts a picturesque, traditional, medieval town centre (\\"Altstadt\\"). The traditional town Gengenbach is the proud owner of the world's biggest advent calendar. The 24 windows of the 18th century town hall represent the 24 \\"windows\\" of an Advent calendar. The town also hosts a department of The Graduate School of Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, part of the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg. The nearest cities in the region are Offenburg, Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Baden-Baden and Strasbourg/France. Gengenbach is twinned with the town of Obernai, Alsace, France. In the 2005 film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Gengenbach was inaccurately referred to as D√ºsseldorf, the place where the character Augustus Gloop becomes the first founder of Wonka's Golden ticket. ==History== Gengenbach was founded in the 13th century and was an Imperial Free City from 1360 until the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801. During the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War in July 1678, it was the site of a French victory over the Imperialists; it was badly damaged in 1689 by retreating French forces in the 1688-1697 Nine Years War.

There have been two incarnations of the Cert Ed over the years. ==New Cert Ed== The current Cert Ed is a non-compulsory qualification offering training in teaching at further or higher education level. Those wanting to teach at primary or secondary education must undertake either a Bachelor of Education or a Bachelor of Arts degree, such as a BA (Hons) Primary Education, or Bachelor of Science (in a relevant Education course) degree or a non-education degree followed by a postgraduate qualification in teaching, such as the PGCE. In 2007, many colleges and Universities stopped teaching the Cert Ed with the advent of the newer Teaching Awards, the Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) replacing the full Cert Ed. ==Old Cert Ed== The old Cert Ed was a qualification that was required to become teachers. The Cert Ed course took three years to complete and was studied for at a College of Education under the control of the local or nearest university. The Cert Ed was discontinued in the early 1980s when the law required all trainee teachers to train via graduate or post-graduate courses. The Cert Ed did allow some students that reached the qualifying level to complete a fourth year for a B.

During his 14-year career, he was the first defenceman to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. He won the award after playing the entire 1948‚Äì49 season without recording a penalty. The penalty-less season was part of a total of 131 consecutive games he played without being assessed a penalty. Quackenbush, considered to be an elite offensive defenceman during his career, was named to the NHL All-Star Team five times, played in eight NHL All-Star games and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976. Following his retirement from professional ice hockey, he spent 18 years as head coach of various teams at Princeton University. Quackenbush coached men's golf, and both the men's and women's ice hockey teams, at various times. He won eight Ivy League Championships with the men's golf team and three with the women's ice hockey team. == Early life == Quackenbush was born on March 2, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario. He was born Hubert George Quackenbush but was given the nickname Bill by his aunt who disliked his given name. He played hockey on outdoor rinks around Toronto during the Great Depression as a youth, and was one of the top high school athletes in Canada as a teenager. In addition to hockey, he was a renowned football and soccer player. During the War Years, he played for the famous Canadian soccer club Toronto Scottish. Quackenbush had an opportunity to play football professionally, but he decided to pursue a career in hockey. Quackenbush began his junior career playing for the Toronto Native Sons of the Ontario Hockey Association. He scored 13 points in 13 games during the 1940‚Äì41 season. The following season, he played for the Brantford Lions, scoring 34 points in 23 games, and caught the attention of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. == Professional career == Quackenbush signed as a free-agent with the Red Wings on October 19, 1942, and played 10 games during the 1942‚Äì43 season before breaking his wrist. After recovering from the injury, Detroit assigned him to the American Hockey League where he joined the Indianapolis Capitals. He earned a regular position with the Red Wings during the 1943‚Äì44 season, scoring 4 goals and 18 points. In the next two seasons he averaged 21 points while only being assessed an average of 8 penalty minutes and scored a career high 11 goals in 1945‚Äì46. The following season he earned his first post-season honour, when he was named a Second Team NHL All-Star. He was also named the Red Wings team MVP. He registered a career high 17 penalty minutes in 1947‚Äì48 and was named a First Team All-Star. The season also saw the start of a streak of 131 consecutive games where Quackenbush was not assessed a penalty. It began with the final 5 regular season and 10 playoff games that year, continued through the entire 60 regular season and 11 playoff games during the 1948‚Äì49 season, and ended after 45 games of the 1949‚Äì50 season. At the conclusion of the 1948‚Äì49 season, he was awarded the Lady Byng Trophy, the NHL's annual award for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct. He was the first defenceman to win the award, and remains one of only three in NHL history to capture the trophy. Detroit General Manager Jack Adams detested the award and felt that any player who won it did not belong on his team, so he promptly traded Quackenbush. He was sent to the Boston Bruins with Pete Horeck for Pete Babando, Lloyd Durham, Clare Martin and Jimmy Peters, Sr. Quackenbush became a fan favourite upon his arrival in Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued to stay out of the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950‚Äì51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year. Quackenbush retired following the 1955‚Äì56 season, having accumulated only 95 penalty minutes over 774 games. This averaged out to seven seconds a game, one of the lowest in NHL history for a player at any position. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976. == Personal == Following his NHL career, Quackenbush worked as a manufacturer's agent while attending night school at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. At Northeastern, he earned an Associate's degree in engineering. Quackenbush also became an assistant coach at Northeastern. In 1967, he became the head coach for Princeton University's men's ice hockey team, a position he would hold for six seasons. His best season was his first in 1967‚Äì68, when the Tigers posted a 13‚Äì10‚Äì0 record. It was the highest win total for Princeton since 1935‚Äì36. However, his success with the men's ice hockey team would not last; Princeton won no more than five games for their next five seasons. His worst campaign was in 1970‚Äì71, when Princeton had two 11 game losing streaks and a 1‚Äì22‚Äì0 overall record. Because of this, Quackenbush stepped down as the head coach in 1973. In 1969 he began coaching the Princeton men's golf team. He enjoyed much greater success with the golf team, leading them to eight Ivy League championships. In 1978 Princeton started a women's ice hockey team, and Quackenbush was asked to coach them. He was still coaching the golf team but decided to accept the additional position and led them to three consecutive Ivy League championships between 1982 and 1984. Quackenbush retired from coaching in 1985, after which he moved to Orlando, Florida, where he lived for several years before moving to New Jersey in 1997. He married Joan Kalloch and the couple had three sons, Bruce, Scott and Todd. At the time of his death, Quackenbush also had seven grandchildren. He died of pneumonia and complications from Alzheimer's disease on September 12, 1999, at Chandler Hall Hospice in Newtown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 77. == Playing style == Quackenbush was an offensive defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, making use of his stick handling, passing skills and ability to read the play. Over the course of his career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL. He was a solid checker, but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play. This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes and the fact that he was assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career. Defensively he made use of poke checks to take the puck from his opponents and excelled at getting to loose pucks and clearing them out of the defensive zone. He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offence from behind the net. == Awards and honours == * Lady Byng Trophy (1949) * Three time NHL First Team All-Star (1948, 1949, 1951) * Two time NHL Second Team All-Star (1947, 1953) * Eight time NHL All-Star Game participant (1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954) * Honored Member of the Hockey Hall of Fame (1976) ==Career statistics== {| border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Abdullah is the all-time leading goalscorer for Saudi Arabia with 72 goals in 117 games. At club level, he is the record goalscorer for Al-Nassr and is the all-time top scorer of the Saudi Professional League. He was often referred to by his nickname \\"Arabian Jewel\\". Majed Abdullah is regarded as one of the greatest Western Asian strikers of all time. He was nominated for IFFHS Asia's Player of the Century, finishing third place. He spent his entire club career at Al- Nassr, and scored 189 league goals in a twenty-one-year career. During this time, Al-Nassr established themselves as one of the dominant forces in Saudi and Asian football. With Majed Abdullah leading the attack, Al-Nassr won five League titles and four King Cup titles as well as the 1997‚Äì98 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. Majed Abdullah also finished as the Saudi League top scorer six times throughout his career. Majed Abdullah retired from football in 1998, after Al-Nassr's Asian Cup Winners' Cup Final victory over Suwon Samsung Bluewings. His success was not limited to the domestic stage, in 1984 Saudi Arabia qualified for their first-ever global international tournament at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Abdullah scored their only goal as Saudi Arabia lost all three group games. International success did come in 1984, however, in the Asian Cup in Singapore. Saudi Arabia beat China 2‚Äì0 in the final to take the title for the first time, with Abdullah scoring the second goal. Four years later in 1988, he would score twice in the tournament in Qatar as the Saudi team retained the title by beating South Korea on penalties. ==Early life== Abdullah was born in the Al-Baghdadia District in Jeddah to Sudanese parents. Majed is the second son of Ahmed Abdullah. Live close to a sports club alongside being the son of a football manager piqued Majed's interest in football. In the mid-1960s, Majed and his family moved to Riyadh where his father got a job as the manager of Al-Nassr's youth team. Majed enrolled in Al-Jazaeria Elementary School and he passionately watched the older kids play football. A couple of years later, Majed joined the school football team as well as the neighborhood team. He used to play as a goalkeeper. One day the team's striker was absent and Majed had to replace him. This position change proved to be successful as Majed guided his team to a 3‚Äì1 victory. Majed's family moved to Hotat Khaled District and the young Majed joined Al-Motawasta Al-Thania high school. Majed and his neighbors formed a team they called \\"Al- Ittifaq\\". They tried to participate in a tournament but their request was rejected due to their young age. They didn't give up and challenged one of Riyadh's best neighborhood teams for a place in that tournament. Al-Ittifaq surprisingly won the match 3‚Äì1 with Majed scoring twice. Al-Ittifaq participated in the tournament and they went on to win the championship. ==Club career== Mohammed Al-Hudayan, a teammate at Al-Ittifaq, recommended Abdullah to Al-Nassr president Prince Abdulrahman Bin Saud, as did Al- Ittifaq's coach Nasseb Awad to Khaled Al-Turki and Al-Nassr coach Ljubi≈°a Broƒáiƒá. Broƒáiƒá went to see Abdullah unannounced at Al-Ittifaq's training field in Al-Batha and requested that the club sign him. Abdullah officially joined Al-Nassr on 10 November 1975. Abdullah spent 2 years playing for the youth teams before being promoted to the senior team. He made his senior debut in a friendly against Moroccan side Al-Fath in January 1977. He made his competitive debut on 21 January 1977 by coming off the bench in the league match against Al-Shabab. Abdullah made his first start as well as score his first goal for Al-Nassr on 18 March 1977 in the league match against Al-Wehda. Following an injury to first-choice striker Mohammad Abdeli, Abdullah was given a chance to prove himself. He repaid that trust by scoring 3 goals in the final 3 rounds of the league. Majed Abdullah finished as the Saudi League top scorer 6 times in his career. He also won the League 4 times as well as the King Cup 4 times. Majed is the all-time top scorer of the Saudi League with 189 goals and is also Al-Nassr's all-time top scorer with 260 goals. Majed Abdullah announced his retirement on 12 April 1998 following Al-Nassr's win in the 1998 Asian Cup Winner's Cup in front of 70,000 fans in Riyadh. ==International Career== Majed made his senior team debut in 1978 in an unofficial friendly against Portuguese giants Benfica where he scored 2 goals. His official debut was against China on 10 December 1978. Majed represented Saudi national team in 2 Asian Cups, 5 Gulf Cups, the 1984 Olympic Games and the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He retired from the National Team shortly after the 1994 World Cup. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Source: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |- !rowspan=2|Club

He is regarded as the leading Danish portrait painter of the 18th century. ==Early life and career== Landscape with Northern Lights - Attempt to Paint the Aurora Borealis, 1790s. He was born in the house of his mother's brother Johan J√∏rgensen, who was a school teacher in Balslev on the island of Funen. Jens Juel was the illegitimate son of Vilhelmine Elisabeth Juel (January 1725 ‚Äì March 1799), who served at Wedellsborg, and a fine gentleman, probably a Wedell or Lord Jens Juel. When Juel was one year old, his mother married J√∏rgen J√∏rgensen (1724 ‚Äì 4 June 1796), who was a schoolmaster in Gamborg, not far from Balslev, and he grew up in Gamborg. Juel showed an interest in painting from an early age, and his parents sent him to be an apprentice of painter Johann Michael Gehrman in Hamburg, where he worked hard for five or six years and improved so much that he acquired a reputation as a painter of portraits, landscapes, etc. During the time of his studies, he could live off painting landscapes, portraits and genre pictures. At just over twenty years old, he moved to Copenhagen to attend the Royal Danish Academy of Art. In 1767 he was awarded its small gold medal and in 1771 the great gold medal, both for Biblical themes. Niels Ryberg with his Son Johan Christian and his Daughter-in-Law Engelke, n√©e Falbe In 1772 Juel left Copenhagen, moving to Rome where he stayed for four years together with other Danish artists, including Nicolai Abildgaard. From Rome, he moved to Paris, at the time a center of portrait painting. In 1777 he moved on to Geneva, where he stayed for two years at the home of his friend Charles Bonnet in the company of other Danish artists, including etcher Johann Friderich Clemens. In Geneva, Juel soon earned a reputation as an excellent artist, and he painted many portraits. Through Bonnet, who had become an honorary member of the Danish Academy, his reputation reached Denmark. After a brief stay in Hamburg, where he met and painted a portrait of the poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, author of The Messiah, he returned to Copenhagen in 1780. Here he painted portraits for the royal house, nobility, and the well-to-do, as well as landscapes and genre paintings and was designated as the court painter. On 4 April 1782, he was unanimously elected to be a member of the Danish Academy by Mandelberg, Weidenhaupt, and Abildgaard. He became the director of the Academy in 1795 and continued in the position until his death. Juel is buried at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==See also== * Art of Denmark ==References== ==External links== * KID Kunst Index Danmark (\\"Art Index Denmark\\") * Danish Biographical Encyclopedia (\\"Dansk biografisk Leksikion\\") Category:1745 births Category:1802 deaths Category:18th-century Danish painters Category:Danish male painters Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni Category:Directors of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Category:Juel family ","title":"Jens Juel (painter)"},{"id":"1996319","text":"Rancho or Ranchos may refer to: ==Settlements & Communities== *Ranchos of California, 19th century land grants in Alta California **List of California Ranchos *Ranchos, Buenos Aires in Argentina ==Schools== *Rancho Christian School in Temecula, California *Rancho High School in North Las Vegas, Nevada *Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine, California *Rancho Solano Preparatory School in Scottsdale, Arizona *Rancho Verde High School in Moreno Valley, California ==Film== *Rancho, a character in the Bollywood film 3 Idiots *Rancho (monkey), an Indian monkey animal actor ==Other== *Rancho, a shock absorber brand by Tenneco Automotive *Rancho carnavalesto or Rancho, a type of dance club from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil *Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center or Rancho *Rancho Point, a rock headland in the South Shetland Islands *Matra Rancho or Rancho, an early French leisure activity vehicle ==See also== * * *El Rancho (disambiguation) *Rancheria (disambiguation) *Ranchero (disambiguation) *Ranch (disambiguation) ","title":"Rancho"},{"id":"1996326","text":"Celaleddin Ko√ßak (born 24 November 1977 in West Berlin, West Germany) is a Turkish footballer.

He later moved to Kentucky to become an educator. While in Louisville, he took the time to attend law school and received a law degree from the University of Louisville Law School in 1849. == Greenville, Indiana == In 1850, Colman became the first principal in Greenville when the Floyd County Seminary opened in Greenville, Indiana. The school was funded by raising $2,000 with Greenville residents contributing an additional $800 to secure the school for their town. For this sum, it was possible to erect a large 2-story brick building on land donated by Isaac Redman. One of the trustees appointed to oversee the new school was John Baptiste Ford of Greenville who was a prominent resident and famous for his glass works. Colman served as Principal in Greenville for two years. In 1852, the Hoosier legislature approved the first laws establishing the public school system. This spelled the end of the older county seminaries for the new law provided that they be closed and their assets turned over to the new public school systems. Some 100 students had been attending the school paying tuition of $4 to $8 a semester and finding board and lodging in Greenville homes at $1 a week. The closing of the Seminary proved to be the end of Colman's teaching career. During Colman's time in Greenville, he met Clara Porter and married in 1851. Clara was the daughter of Daniel Porter who is best known for Porter's Public House in Greenville which was a notorious hotel, bar, and social spot. Together they had two children; Laura Kate Colman (1860) and Francis Porter Colman (1862). == Missouri == Colman then moved to Missouri, ostensibly to farm. He was elected as an Alderman for St. Louis city's 5th ward as a Whig in 1854 and 1855Missouri Republican (3/27/1854) (4/1/1855) In 1855 he founded the Valley Farmer newspaper. As a result of his publication, Colman became a prominent figure in Missouri farming circles, which set the path for a political career in the Missouri House of Representatives. The publication of Colman's newspaper was interrupted by the American Civil War, but three years after the war he founded the Coleman's Rural World. His political career continued, culminating with his election as the 17th Lieutenant Governor of Missouri from 1875 to 1877, as a Democrat. == Commissioner of Agriculture == President Grover Cleveland appointed Colman Commissioner of Agriculture in 1885. During his tenure he led a coalition of land-grant agricultural colleges in writing proposed legislation for the creation of agricultural experiment stations. Their lobbying efforts helped produce the Hatch Act in 1887. == 1st Secretary of Agriculture == He also lobbied for the creation of the United States Department of Agriculture and served as its inaugural Secretary at the end of Cleveland's term, February 15, 1889 to March 6, 1889. However, his position was never confirmed by the United States Senate.Grossman, 2 == Retirement == He returned to St. Louis to run his newspaper. He also spent the next 20 years in state public service and in horse-breeding.

The film uses the anaglyph 3-D technology, similar to the one used in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003). The film stars Taylor Lautner, Taylor Dooley, Cayden Boyd, David Arquette, Kristin Davis and George Lopez. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by Hybride Technologies, CafeFX, The Orphanage, Post Logic, Hydraulx, Industrial Light & Magic, R!ot Pictures, Tippett Studio, Amalgamated Pixels, Intelligent Creatures and Troublemaker Digital. The film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39 million in the United States and $69.4 million worldwide on a $50 million budget. A stand-alone sequel, We Can Be Heroes, will be released to Netflix in 2021, with Lautner and Dooley reprising their roles. ==Plot== Max is a 10-year-old lonely child in the suburbs of Austin who creates an imaginary dream world named Planet Drool, where all of his dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (who was a marine biologist) at sea and became a shark- hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them on fire. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. Max is also bullied by his fellow classmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad. After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad thanks to Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now- corrupt electrician, under the orders of an unknown mastermind. They confront Mr. Electric in his lair, but he drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \\"plughounds\\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered the dreamworld with Max's journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by singing bubbles called LaLas and has a \\"shark frenzy\\", destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks Max why she is made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down. Max, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl eventually reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are too late to stop the corruption since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Afterwards, Mr. Electric seemingly kills Sharkboy by fooling him into jumping into water filled with electric eels, which are his weakness, with Lavagirl sacrificing herself by jumping into the water to retrieve him. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees. Minus offers Mr. Electric to return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He also informs Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to destroy Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric arrives in the tornado before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the storm as well, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents. Max later informs his class that Planet Drool has become a proper dreamworld once again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \\"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\\". ==Cast== * Cayden Boyd as Max. An imaginative 10-year-old boy, known as the \\"day-dreamer\\" on Planet Drool. \\"At first he's dreaming all for himself; he wants Shark Boy and Lava Girl to take him away\\", Boyd said about the role. \\"I like that he's selfish in the beginning and he's not selfish in the end\\". * Taylor Lautner as Sharkboy. Lautner said about the character, \\"He's very self-confident and sometimes his confidence gets him into trouble. He's also kinda jealous of the character, Max, because he has an inside crush on Lavagirl and she's overly motherly to Max.\\" Lautner's martial arts skills helped him to obtain the role of Sharkboy. \\"When I auditioned for the film, Robert Rodriguez, the director, didn't know that I had my martial arts [background], and while we were there in Austin, TX he saw a DVD of me and asked me to choreograph my own fight scenes\\", said Lautner. Lautner was the first to audition for the film, says Rodriguez, and was chosen immediately. * as Lavagirl. The role was cast after the two other main characters, Sharkboy and Max, had already been cast. Her lava bike was computer-generated, like many of the elements in the film; Dooley and Lautner described the on-set versions of the lava bike and Sharkboy's shark-themed jetski as \\"a green box with handles\\". * David Arquette and Kristin Davis play Max's parents. Max's father is an unemployed writer. They are on the brink of a divorce. They mean well for Max, but are unable to settle his troubles. On Planet Drool, Max's parents appear as a pair of \\"Cookie Giants\\" who live happily in the Land of Milk and Cookies. * George Lopez as Mr. Electricidad, Mr. Electric, and the voices of Tobor and the Ice Guardian. Mr. Electricidad is Max's teacher. Mr. Electric is Planet Drool's corrupt electrician. Tobor is an unfinished robot of Max that resided in the Dream Graveyard. The Ice Guardian is an inhabitant of the Ice Kingdom. Rodriguez states that he kept asking Lopez to play additional characters. Lopez spent a total of two weeks working on the film. * Jacob Davich as Linus / Minus. He is a bully at Max's school and steals his Dream Journal. With it, he enters Max's dreamworld and, using the name \\"Minus\\" (a nickname bestowed by Mr. Electricidad for Linus' habit of disliked conduct), alters it to his version before ultimately befriending Max. * Sasha Pieterse as Marissa Electricidad / Ice Princess. Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, a necklace she wears that can freeze anything including time. * Robert Rodriguez has a role voicing a shark. As seen in the credits, two of Robert Rodriguez's children, Rebel and Racer, portray Sharkboy at age five and age seven respectively. Rico Torres plays Sharkboy's father. Marc Musso and Shane Graham play children at Max's school. ==Production== Parts of the film were shot on location in Texas in September to December 2004, where Max resides and goes to school in the film. Much of the film was shot in a studio against green screen. Most of the ships, landscapes and other effects including some creatures and characters, were accomplished digitally. According to Lautner and Dooley, when filming the scene with the dream train, the front part of the train was an actual physical set piece. \\"The whole inside was there and when they have all the gadgets you can pull on, that was all there but everything else was a green screen,\\" said Dooley. Eleven visual effects companies (Hybride Technologies, CafeFX, The Orphanage, Post Logic, Hydraulx, Industrial Light & Magic, R!ot Pictures, Tippett Studio, Amalgamated Pixels and Intelligent Creatures and Rodriguez's Texas-based Troublemaker Digital) worked on the film in order to accomplish over 1,000 visual effect shots. Robert Rodriguez appears in the credits fourteen times, most notably as director, a producer, a screenwriter (along with Marcel Rodriguez), visual effects supervisor, director of photography, editor, a camera operator, and a composer and performer. The story is credited to Racer Max Rodriguez, with additional story elements by Rebecca Rodriguez, who also wrote the lyrics for the main song, \\"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\\". Other members of the Rodriguez family can be seen in the film or were involved in the production. Miley Cyrus had auditioned for the film with Lautner, and said it came down to her and another girl who was also auditioning; however, Cyrus then began production on Hannah Montana, and thus the other girl, supposedly Dooley, got the role. ==Reception== ===Critical response === The film holds a 19% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 4.33/10. The consensus reads, \\"The decision to turn this kiddie fantasy into a 3-D film was a miscalculation.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and agreed with the other criticisms in which the 3-D process used was distracting and muted the colors, thus, he believes, \\"spoiling\\" much of the film and that the film would look more visually appealing when released in the home media market. Movie review ===Box office=== For its opening weekend, the film earned $12.6 million in 2,655 theaters. It was placed at number 5 at the box office, being overshadowed by Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Madagascar, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, and The Longest Yard. The film was not very successful in the US, taking in $39,177,541 and was a box office bomb. However, it did manage to gross $30,248,282 overseas, for a total of $69,425,966 worldwide. ===Lawsuit=== The Total Nonstop Action professional wrestler Dean Roll, who trademarked the name \\"Shark Boy\\" in 1999, sued Miramax on June 8, 2005, claiming that his trademark had been infringed and demanding \\"[any] money, profits and advantages wrongfully gained\\". In April 2007, the suit was settled for a disclosed amount of $200,000. ==Soundtrack== Director Robert Rodriguez composed parts of the score himself, with contributions by composers John Debney and Graeme Revell. Green Day were reportedly set to contribute \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" to the soundtrack, but Robert Rodriguez declined it. ==Books== Around the time of the film's debut Rodriguez co-wrote a series of children's novels entitled Sharkboy and Lavagirl Adventures with acclaimed science fiction writer Chris Roberson. They include Book 1, The Day Dreamer, and Book 2, Return to Planet Drool, which announces that it will be continued in a third volume, Deep Sleep, which was never released. They are illustrated throughout by Alex Toader, who designed characters and environments for the film and the previous Spy Kids franchise. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised another book appearing around the time of the film, The Adventures of SharkBoy and LavaGirl: The Movie Storybook (by Racer Max Rodriguez and Robert Rodriguez), as a far cry from the usual movie storybook tie-in, and also praised Alex Toader's \\"cartoony yet detailed\\" illustrations. ==Future== In an interview during the 2020 Comic-Con@Home event, Rodriguez confirmed that a character in his upcoming film We Can Be Heroes is the daughter of Sharkboy and Lavagirl who has both \\"shark and lava powers\\". Taylor Dooley is confirmed to reprise her role in the film as Lavagirl. The film is scheduled to be released through Netflix. ==Notes== ==References* * Category:2005 films Category:2000s 3D films Category:2000s adventure comedy films Category:2000s fantasy-comedy films Category:2000s teen comedy films Category:2000s superhero films Category:American 3D films Category:American films Category:American children's adventure films Category:American children's comedy films Category:American children's fantasy films Category:American superhero films Category:Child superheroes Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Dimension Films films Category:English-language films Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell Category:Films scored by Robert Rodriguez Category:Film superheroes Category:Films about dreams Category:Films about orphans Category:Films directed by Robert Rodriguez Category:Films produced by Elizabeth Avell√°n Category:Films set in Austin, Texas Category:Films shot in Austin, Texas Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Rodriguez Category:Superhero comedy films Category:Teen superhero films Category:Troublemaker Studios films Category:2005 comedy films ","title":"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D"},{"id":"1996357","text":"Lawrence David Mendte (born January 16, 1957) is an American news anchor, commentator and radio talk show host.

The road runs from the Massachusetts border at Hollis to North Hampton on the Atlantic shore. The western terminus of NH 111 is at the Massachusetts state line in Hollis, where, as Massachusetts Route 111 (Nashua Road), the road continues into the town of Pepperell, Massachusetts, ultimately terminating in Concord at Massachusetts Route 2. The eastern terminus of NH 111 is at the junction with Ocean Boulevard (New Hampshire Route 1A) in North Hampton. At its terminus, the road is known as Atlantic Avenue. == Route description == New Hampshire Route 111's western terminus is at the Massachusetts state line at the southeastern corner of the town of Hollis, New Hampshire. The roadway continues to the south as Massachusetts Route 111. Eastbound NH 111 continues in a mostly northeasterly direction along Runnels Bridge Road, crossing the Nashua River about 1/2 mile from the border, and passing the Overlook Country Club. Immediately after the Nashua River bridge, NH 111A leaves to the east along Groton Road. NH 111 crosses into the city of Nashua, and the name changes to West Hollis Street. In Nashua, the route parallels the Nashua River's south bank, moving through the suburban southwestern quadrant of the city. At U.S. Route 3, a complex interchange involves the U.S. Route 3 freeway, NH 111, the eastern terminus of NH 111A (now called Main Dunstable Road), and several local streets. Leaving the interchange, NH 111 splits into two one-way streets, with West Hollis Street carrying westbound 111, and Kinsley Street carrying eastbound 111. St. Joseph Hospital lies along this stretch. After crossing Main Street and passing Nashua City Hall and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, the two one-way streets merge again onto East Hollis Street. Going through an industrial part of East Nashua, still following the south bank of the Nashua River, NH 111 crosses the twin-span Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial bridges over the Merrimack River (known locally as the Hudson Bridge) into the town of Hudson. Traversing Hudson Village along with NH 102 and intersecting NH 3A, the route goes east following Ferry Street and Burnham Road, before turning northeast along Central Street, one of the main commercial areas of the town of Hudson. In the village of Hudson Center, NH 111 passes the former site of Benson's Wild Animal Farm, now a town park known as Benson Park. Passing through an industrial area of eastern Hudson, NH 111 enters Windham shortly before crossing Mammoth Road/NH 128. NH 111 crosses through the middle of the town of Windham, known locally as Haverhill Road (west of the town center) and Indian Rock Road (east of the town center). An interchange with I-93 lies near Canobie Lake Park as well as the northern terminus of the central NH 111A. After intersecting with Rockingham Road/NH 28 the route turns to a more northerly direction, and crosses into the extreme northern part of Salem. Briefly entering the extreme southeastern corner of Derry near Island Pond, it passes through the northwest corner of the town of Atkinson, then enters the town of Hampstead. Within Hampstead, NH 111 forms the main southwest-northeast road through town, crossing NH 121 in the southern part of town, and NH 121A in the northeastern, more commercial part of town, an area known as East Hampstead. At the Danville town line the route intersects the eastern NH 111A. NH 111 continues east to enter the town of Kingston, where the road ends at a T-intersection with NH 125. NH 111 joins NH 125 northbound, acting as a bypass of Main Street and the Kingston town center. NH 107 joins the bypass near the Kingston Fairways Golf Club, then NH 111 leaves the multiplex at the north end of Main Street, and follows Exeter Road northeast out of Kingston, into the town of Exeter. Upon entering Exeter, NH 111 becomes Kingston Road and approaches the downtown area from the southwest. Within downtown, it is known as Front Street. After crossing the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, it joins NH 27 at Water Street (an intersection which serves as the terminus of the eastern NH 111A), and NH 108/Court Street and crosses a bridge over the Exeter River. Upon crossing the bridge, the three routes are now known as High Street, and continue towards the southeastern corner of town. Immediately after the bridge, NH 108 leaves to the north. Just before leaving town, there is a short concurrency with NH 88, then NH 111 leaves NH 27 along Exeter Road, and interchanges with NH 101. Leaving Exeter, NH 111 crosses a few dozen feet of the southern corner of Stratham, providing access to a small industrial park. Next entering the town of North Hampton, Exeter Road/NH 111 passes over, but does not interchange with, I-95. A complex five-way intersection lies near the center of North Hampton, with NH 111 crossing NH 151 and Hobbs Road. NH 111 turns southeast here along Atlantic Avenue, crossing US 1 and terminating at the Atlantic Ocean on Ocean Boulevard/NH 1A, in the area known as Little Boars Head. ==History== left The portion of NH 111 between New Hampshire Route 27 in Hampton and NH 1A in Hampton Beach was once designated New Hampshire Route 101D.New Hampshire Routes 101-125 ==Major intersections== ==Suffixed routes== ===New Hampshire Route 111A=== New Hampshire Route 111A is a designation held by three separate state highways in New Hampshire. Although none of the segments directly connect, all three roadways are linked by their parent, New Hampshire Route 111. ====Western segment==== The western segment of NH 111A is a northeast‚Äìsouthwest loop road in Hollis and Nashua in Hillsborough County. The segment is signed east‚Äìwest. The eastern terminus is in Nashua at NH 111, west of the point where NH 111 and U.S. Route 3 meet. At that location, NH 111A is known as Main Dunstable Road. The western terminus is at NH 111 approximately north of the Massachusetts state line in Hollis. At that location, NH 111A is called South Depot Road. ====Middle segment==== The middle segment of NH 111A is a northeast‚Äìsouthwest highway between Pelham in Hillsborough County and Windham in Rockingham County. It is signed as an east- west highway. The southern, officially western, terminus is in the town of Pelham at New Hampshire Route 128 (Mammoth Road) approximately north of the Massachusetts state line. At this point, the road is named Marsh Road. The northern, signed eastern, terminus of the highway is in the town of Windham at NH 111 between Cobbetts Pond and Canobie Lake. At this point, the road is known as Range Road. ====Eastern segment==== The eastern segment of NH 111A is a northeast‚Äìsouthwest highway between Danville and Exeter in Rockingham County. It is signed as an east-west highway. The eastern terminus of this segment of NH 111A is in Exeter at NH 111 on the west side of String Bridge. At this location, NH 111A is named Water Street. The western terminus is in Danville at NH 111. At that location, the road is known as Main Street. ==References== ==External links== * New Hampshire State Route 111 on Flickr * New Hampshire State Route 111A on Flickr 111 Category:Transportation in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation in Rockingham County, New Hampshire ","title":"New Hampshire Route 111"},{"id":"1996367","text":"The following table lists the various web template engines used in Web template systems and a brief rundown of their features. {| class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" border=\\"1\\" |- !

It is the major east‚Äìwest highway in the southern portion of the state. The western terminus of NH 101 is in Keene at the junction with New Hampshire Routes 9, 10 and 12. The eastern terminus is in Hampton Beach at the junction with Ocean Boulevard (NH 1A). The total length of NH 101 is . However, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation has installed mileposts on the freeway section east of Interstate 93 that begin at mile 100. The eastern half of the road, from Bedford to Hampton, is a freeway except for the easternmost two miles, while the western half from Keene to Bedford is a mixture of two- and four-lane roads, town streets, and a super two segment which bypasses the town centers of Milford and Amherst. NH 101 travels through the following municipalities (west to east): Keene, Marlborough, Dublin, Peterborough, Temple, Wilton, Milford, Amherst, Bedford, Manchester, Auburn, Candia, Raymond, Epping, Brentwood, Exeter, Stratham, and Hampton. Between Exeter and Hampton, NH 101 is known as the Exeter‚ÄìHampton Expressway. There are two current and three former auxiliary routes for NH 101. The ones which remain are NH 101A, which connects Milford and Nashua, and NH 101E, which parallels the main route in Hampton. ==Route description== NH 101 is a two-lane surface road from its western terminus in Keene to the western terminus of New Hampshire Route 101A in Milford. From there, NH 101 splits off to the south and becomes a two-lane limited-access highway that bypasses Milford and Amherst, becoming a two-lane surface road just north of Amherst. At the southern terminus of New Hampshire Route 114 in Bedford, NH 101 becomes a four-lane limited-access highway. It expands to six lanes upon merging with Interstate 293 in Manchester, and eight lanes upon merging with Interstate 93. East of I-93, NH 101 narrows to four lanes. The route remains a four-lane freeway until exit 12 (Interstate 95) in Hampton, where NH 101 becomes a two-lane expressway at exit 13. At an interchange with U.S. Route 1, it becomes a two-lane surface road to its terminus in Hampton Beach. ==History== Most of the eastern section of NH 101 was originally going to be part of the cancelled New England East‚ÄìWest Highway from Albany, New York, to Portsmouth. Because of the cancellation, NH 101 remained a two-lane freeway until the mid-1990s. This highly traveled road had numerous accidents, prominently advertised on large signs at the start of the two-lane freeway segment between exits 5 and 6 in Raymond, which read, \\"XX Highway Deaths next XX miles.\\" Locally, this road was known as the Highway of Death for the unusually high number of accidents and the sign advertising. In the mid-1990s, the two-lane freeway segment was dualized over much of the swampland it traversed in Rockingham County, creating a full divided controlled access freeway between Manchester and I-95. The old Highway of Death nickname and the signs have disappeared from use. In 1991, an overpass was constructed over North Road in Brentwood near the Rockingham County Jail Farm for the future routing of NH 101. However, the NH 101 expressway was not built in this area until 2000, giving the bridge the nickname the \\"bridge to nowhere\\". Several portions of the highway have been named after prominent figures by the state legislature. According to the state Department of Transportation, the portion from Keene to the Merrimack River was named the Horace Greeley Highway in 1949. The name Robert C. Erler Highway was given to the stretch of highway \\"from a beginning point at the Auburn-Candia town line to the Raymond-Epping town line\\" in 1981. Erler was a former Raymond town selectman and state legislator. In 1995, the name Jay McDuffee Highway was given to the stretch \\"from the Epping/Raymond town line to its terminus in Hampton.\\"[N.H. Department of Transportation internal document: \\"New Hampshire Named Highways, Rest Areas, Bridges, etc. (1900 to 2016)\\"] ===New Hampshire Route 51=== left NH 101 between New Hampshire Route 108 in Stratham, just east of the Exeter town line, to New Hampshire Route 1A in Hampton Beach was opened in 1963 as the Exeter-Hampton Expressway. It was marked with seemingly unique round shields featuring the highway's name, and was later designated New Hampshire Route 51 during the 1980s until October 1994. During this time, NH 101 exited the expressway at NH 108 (exit 11) and formed a concurrency with NH 108 north to the community of Stratham. After traversing a traffic circle, NH 101 split from NH 108 and followed the current alignment of New Hampshire Route 33 into downtown Portsmouth, where NH 101 terminated at U.S. Route 1. On NH 51, there were two traffic lights located on the limited access two-lane highway: the east-end lights at the terminus of New Hampshire Route 88 southeast of exit 11 and the west-end lights west of the Newfields (then-New Hampshire Route 85) exit with what is now New Hampshire Route 27. While NH 88 was rerouted on a new stretch of road to intersect with NH 108 just south of the NH 101/108 SPUI interchange at exit 11, the Newfields exit was upgraded to a full diamond interchange. NH 27 west of Stratham was formerly NH 101 prior to the completion of the four-lane bypass. In the fall of 1994, the eastern terminus of NH 101 was shifted eight miles (13 km) south from Portsmouth to its current terminus in Hampton Beach, replacing NH 51 along the Super-2 between Exeter and Hampton Beach. Old NH 101 between Stratham and downtown Portsmouth became NH 33 and the NH 51 designation was eliminated. == Future == New Hampshire 101 has long been proposed as a part of the greater East‚ÄìWest Highway, which would provide upgraded freeway connections across the three Northern New England states (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont). Some early proposals suggested that the route be part of the Interstate Highway System as Interstate 92, but these were rejected. More recent proposals suggested that the entire route could be part of a privately maintained toll road. Northern New England is served by three north‚Äìsouth freeways radiating generally northwards from Boston, Massachusetts ‚Äî from east to west, I-95, Interstate 93, and U.S. Route 3, all coming from or through the Boston metro area; and westernmost of all, by Interstate 91, which follows the Connecticut River. However, the northernmost complete east‚Äìwest freeway existing within the region, Interstate 90 in Massachusetts, does not enter northern New England. Continuous east‚Äìwest freeway travel through (and within) northern New England is presently accomplished by three segments, only one of which is truly east- west. There are a handful of alternate east-west roadways, including US-2 between Montpelier, Vermont, and Bangor, Maine; US-302 between Montpelier and Portland, US-4 from the New York/Vermont border to Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and VT-9 / NH-9 between Bennington, Vermont and the Concord, New Hampshire area. These alternatives are mostly not limited access or designed for higher speed travel. ==Major intersections== ==Suffixed routes== ===New Hampshire Route 101A=== New Hampshire Route 101A (abbreviated NH 101A) is a east‚Äìwest highway in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, connecting Milford and Nashua. It also runs through Merrimack and Amherst, and very briefly touches Hollis. The western terminus of NH 101A is in western Milford at the intersection with NH 101. The eastern terminus is in the center of Nashua, when it meets New Hampshire Route 111 at the Merrimack River. Most of it is two lanes in each direction, sometimes with a central turning lane. Route 101A is quite busy by southern New Hampshire standards, with traffic ranging from 26,000 vehicles per weekday in Nashua to 9,000 in western Milford. The road carries a number of names. In Milford it is Elm Street and then Nashua Street; in Amherst and Merrimack it is the Milford Road or, more commonly, just 101A; in Nashua it is Amherst Street. There is some confusion over the eastern terminus; Google Maps shows the route continuing to the Taylor Falls Bridge and ending at the bridge, while the Official New Hampshire Route Map shows the route ending at the eastern terminus of Amherst Street, where it meets Main Street and Concord Street.. Local signage also stops at the end of Amherst Street. ===New Hampshire Route 101B=== New Hampshire Route 101B was a designation once held by two separate state highways in New Hampshire. Although the two segments did not directly connect, they were linked at the time by their parent route, New Hampshire Route 101. ====Western segment==== The western segment of NH 101B was a roughly east‚Äìwest road in the Manchester area. The western terminus of the route was at U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 28 in Hooksett, the current western terminus of New Hampshire Route 27. The eastern terminus was at NH 101 near Candia. All of the western segment of NH 101B was renumbered NH 27 at an unknown time.New Hampshire Routes 101-125 ====Eastern segment==== The eastern segment of NH 101B was a short east‚Äìwest road in downtown Portsmouth. The western terminus was at the intersection of Islington Street and Middle Road, where NH 101, which followed the present alignment of New Hampshire Route 33 into Portsmouth, departed the routing of NH 33 and followed Islington Street to U.S. Route 1. NH 101B continued east on Middle Road and South Street, following the modern alignment of NH 33 to the present eastern terminus of NH 33 at US 1. At US 1, NH 101B continued east on South Street, running along the local street to its eastern terminus at New Hampshire Route 1B. Prior to 1971, NH 101B from Islington Street east to US 1 became NH 101 while Islington Street and the portion of NH101B east of US 1 reverted to city maintenance. This section of NH 101 was renumbered to NH 33 in 1994. ===New Hampshire Route 101C=== New Hampshire Route 101C ran from NH 108 east along what is now NH 27 to NH 1A in Hampton Beach. ===New Hampshire Route 101D=== The portion of NH 111 between New Hampshire Route 27 in Hampton and NH 1A in Hampton Beach was once designated New Hampshire Route 101D. ===New Hampshire Route 101E=== New Hampshire Route 101E is a short stretch of urban road in length in Hampton, Rockingham County, New Hampshire. This road connects Lafayette Road (U.S. Route 1) with Ocean Boulevard (New Hampshire Route 1A). NH 101E is locally named Winnacunnet Road. Oddly, this highway has never connected with NH 101, its \\"parent\\", or any of its spurs. The entire route is maintained by the town of Hampton. NH 101E is very poorly signed. There exist guide signs at the eastern terminus at NH 1A, but along the road itself, there is no signage to indicate the route's number. It is not known as \\"Route 101E\\" to local residents; they refer to it as \\"Winnacunnet Road.\\" ==References== * Steve Anderson's BostonRoads.com: NH 101 Expressway ==Further reading== * ==External links== * New Hampshire State Route 101 on Flickr * New Hampshire State Route 101A on Flickr * New Hampshire State Route 101E on Flickr Category:Freeways in the United States 101 Category:Transportation in Cheshire County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation in Rockingham County, New Hampshire Category:Two-lane freeways in the United States ","title":"New Hampshire Route 101"},{"id":"1996372","text":"New Hampshire Route 114 (abbreviated NH 114) is a secondary north-south highway in central New Hampshire.

While playing as a cellist in the Utrecht Stedelijk Orkest, he won a composition prize from the Concertgebouw Orchestra for his Suite No. 3, which he presented in his 1932 conducting debut, also with that orchestra. He held posts with the Utrecht Stedelijk Orkest, before being appointed chief conductor of the Residentie Orkest in The Hague (1949‚Äì1973). He spent his last 11 years in Australia. From 1967 to 1970 he was chief conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and in 1971 he was appointed chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, where he remained for the rest of his life.

It is also called Muller's glass, water opal and jalite. The name M√ºller's glass derived from the name of its discoverer, Franz-Joseph M√ºller von Reichenstein. ==Properties== Hyalite's Mohs hardness is 5.5 to 6 and has a specific gravity of 1.9 - 2.1. It has no planes of cleavage but fractures conchoidally, is clear or translucent and has a globular structure. Its luster is vitreous and its streak is white. Hyalite is an amorphous form of silica (SiO2) formed as a volcanic sublimate in volcanic or pegmatic rock and is therefore considered a mineraloid. It contains 3 - 8% water, either as a silanol group or in molecular form. ==Uses== Opalescent hyalite is used in jewellery, and well-formed samples are of interest to collectors due to their unusual appearance, mode of formation and relative rarity. It is sometimes mistaken for resin opal or silica glass since they both may appear clear and globular, but it can be identified under ultraviolet light due to its bright green fluorescence. ==External links== *Mindat data Category:Opals ","title":"Hyalite"},{"id":"1996428","text":"Sutherland was a Scottish constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. ==Creation== The British parliamentary constituency was created in 1708 following the Acts of Union, 1707 and replaced the former Parliament of Scotland shire constituency of Sutherlandshire. ==Boundaries== The constituency represented essentially the traditional county of Sutherland.

In the United States, computer fraud is specifically proscribed by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which criminalizes computer-related acts under federal jurisdiction. Types of computer fraud include: *Distributing hoax emails *Accessing unauthorized computers *Engaging in data mining via spyware and malware *Hacking into computer systems to illegally access personal information, such as credit cards or Social Security numbers *Sending computer viruses or worms with the intent to destroy or ruin another party's computer or system. Phishing, social engineering, viruses, and DDoS attacks are fairly well-known tactics used to disrupt service or gain access to another's network, but this list is not inclusive. ==Notable incidents== ;The Melissa Virus/Worm The Melissa Virus appeared on thousands of email systems on 26 March 1999. It was disguised in each instance as an important message from a colleague or friend. The virus was designed to send an infected email to the first 50 email addresses on the users‚Äô Microsoft Outlook address book. Each infected computer would infect 50 additional computers, which in turn would infect another 50 computers. The virus proliferated rapidly and exponentially, resulting in substantial interruption and impairment of public communications and services. Many system administrators had to disconnect their computer systems from the Internet. Companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Lockheed Martin and Lucent Technologies were forced to shut down their email gateways due to the vast number of emails the virus was generating. The Melissa virus is the most costly outbreak to date, causing more than $400 million in damages to North American businesses. After an investigation conducted by multiple branches of government and law enforcement, the Melissa Virus/Worm was attributed to David L. Smith, a 32-year-old New Jersey programmer, who was eventually charged with computer fraud.Johanna Granville ‚ÄúDot.Con: The Dangers of Cyber Crime and a Call for Proactive Solutions,‚Äù Australian Journal of Politics and History, vol. 49, no. 1. (Winter 2003), pp. 102-109. Smith was one of the first people ever to be prosecuted for the act of writing a virus. He was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison and was fined $5,000. In addition, he was also ordered to serve three years of supervised release after completion of his prison sentence. The investigation involved members of New Jersey State Police High Technology Crime Unit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Justice Department‚Äôs Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. ==See also== *Information security *Information technology audit ==References== ==External links== *Information Security & Computer Fraud Cases & Investigations *Cornell Law: Computer and Internet Fraud Category:Internet fraud Category:Information technology audit ","title":"Computer fraud"},{"id":"1996440","text":"Klas Inge \\"Klabbe\\" Ingesson (20 August 1968 ‚Äì 29 October 2014) was a Swedish footballer and manager. He spent most of his career as a midfielder in Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, England, Italy and France. Ingesson represented the Sweden national team on 57 occasions, including the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cup, as well as the 1992 European Championship. He was the manager of IF Elfsborg from 2013 until his death in October 2014. ==Playing career== He played for IFK G√∂teborg in Sweden, KV Mechelen in Belgium, PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands, Sheffield Wednesday in England, Bari, Bologna and Lecce in Italy, and Marseille in France. At Sheffield Wednesday, he encountered players \\"who went straight to the pub after training but still able to run like wild animals come Saturday\\". ==Coaching career== On 30 September 2013, Ingesson was appointed manager of IF Elfsborg.https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=2183412.html ==Personal life== After retiring from playing Ingesson became a lumberjack, and also appeared as a presenter on the Swedish TV programme Farlig Fritid (\\"Dangerous Leisures\\"). On 14 May 2009, Ingesson announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The treatment was at the start said to be going \\"in the right direction\\". Ingesson fully recovered and, on December 2010, made a football comeback by accepting an offer to guide the IF Elfsborg under-21 youth team. On 8 January 2013, Ingesson revealed that the myeloma had returned, and that he would have a stem cell transplant, as the two previous autologous (i.e. of his own stem cells) transplants had been unsuccessful. On 29 October 2014, Ingesson died of the effects of multiple myeloma. He was married and had two children. ==International statistics== {| class=\\"wikitable\\"  ! colspan=3 | Sweden national team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |1989||6||3 |- |1990||9||3 |- |1991||4||0 |- |1992||11||3 |- |1993||8||0 |- |1994||13||3 |- |1995||1||0 |- |1996||4||1 |- |1997||0||0 |- |1998||1||0 |- !Total||57||13 |} ==International goals== :Scores and results list Sweden's goal tally first. {| class=\\"wikitable\\" ! # !!

Misimoviƒá is the second most capped player in the history of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team, capped 84 times. His 25 international goals also makes him his country's third top-goalscorer. He represented Bosnia and Herzegovina at 2014 FIFA World Cup. Prior to joining Dynamo Moscow, Misimoviƒá made a name for himself while playing for VfL Wolfsburg, with whom he won the Bundesliga in the 2008‚Äì09 season. In the same season, he accomplished 20 assists, which was the most in that season. ==Early life== Misimoviƒá was born to a family of Bosnian Serb gastarbeiters who came to West Germany from Bosanska Gradi≈°ka during the late 1960s. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Known in Germany as Zwetschge (a German plum) due to similar pronunciation to his first name, Misimoviƒá was a product of Bayern Munich youth academy. He played for four years with the club's reserve team, collecting 44 goals in 102 appearances. In the 2003‚Äì04 Regionalliga season, Misimoviƒá scored 21 goals, a personal best, finishing the league as top goalscorer jointly with Paolo Guerrero, his teammate. His first and only hat-trick on club level came in a 5‚Äì1 win over SC Pfullendorf on 2 November. Bayern II won the championship, but since being a reserve side, were barred from promotion, thus allowing 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken to be promoted to the 2004‚Äì05 2. Bundesliga. During this time, he was able to play five times for the main squad. His senior debut occurred on 12 April 2003 in a 0‚Äì1 loss to Werder Bremen, match valid for the 28th week of 2002‚Äì03 Bundesliga; he entered the match as a 78-minute substitute, replacing fellow midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. Misimoviƒá joined VfL Bochum at the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season. He left the club at the end of 2007‚Äì08 season after his contract expired, while his move to 1. FC N√ºrnberg was announced in January 2007. Misimoviƒá signed for 1. FC N√ºrnberg in July 2007, immediately becoming one of the most important players in the squad. He made his first appearance of the season in the opening championship week against Karlsruher SC. Later on 15 September, he opened his scoring account by netting his side's first goal in an eventual 2‚Äì2 home draw against Hannover 96. In January of the following year, he suffered a groin injury, but was recovered back in time for the start of the second part of the season. However, in February, he was injured again, this time in his ankle ligament, which kept him sidelined for the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Cup round of 32 tie against Benfica; without him, N√ºrnberg lost 3‚Äì2 on aggregate and was eliminated from the competition. It was a breakthrough season for Misimoviƒá, who scored ten league goals in 28 appearances, earning him a transfer to VfL Wolfsburg. ===VfL Wolfsburg=== Wolfsburg Misimoviƒá completed a transfer to fellow Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg in June 2008 for ‚Ç¨3.9 million, with the move becoming official on 1 July. He signed a contract until June 2012 and took squad number 10 for the 2008‚Äì09 season. Misimoviƒá made his official debut for the team on 16 August in the opening league match against 1. FC K√∂ln, scoring the winning goal in the 78th minute for a 2‚Äì1 win at home. In October, he scored a brace in a 4‚Äì1 win over Arminia Bielefeld in his 100th Bundesliga appearance. Together with fellow Bosnian international Edin D≈æeko and Brazilian striker Grafite, they formed \\"the magic triangle\\". He played 33 matches during the season, all of them as starter, being instrumental for Wolfsburg who its first ever Bundesliga title. Misimoviƒá scored seven league goals, and also achieved 20 assists for the club, which was the record number of assists in one Bundesliga season, until Kevin De Bruyne surpassed it with one assist more, also while playing for Wolfsburg as well, in the 2014‚Äì15 season. In DFB-Pokal, Misimoviƒá played four matches as his side was knocked out in quarter-finals by Werder Bremen, while in UEFA Cup, he contributed with eight matches and four goals, including a brace against Braga in group stage, as Wolfsburg was eliminated in knockout stage. On 4 August 2009, Misimoviƒá outstanding performances were rewarded with a new deal until 2013. He commented the renewal, stating the he \\"feels at home\\" at Wolfsburg\\". Later in September, Misimoviƒá made his UEFA Champions League debut by playing full-90 minutes in a 3‚Äì1 home win versus Russia's PFC CSKA Moscow in the first match of group stage. He played in all group matches, but Wolfsburg didn't go more than the 3rd place, thus getting relegated to UEFA Europa League. His only goal in the competition came on 3 November against Be≈üikta≈ü, netting the opener and then setting the third scored by D≈æeko in a 3‚Äì0 win at Vodafone Park. In December, Misimoviƒá was one of the four Wolfsburg players to be nominated for 2009 UEFA Team of the Year, but did not made the final list. In UEFA Europa League, he scored his only goal in a round of 16 tie against Rubin Kazan in an eventual quarter-final exit. In the championship, despite Wolfsburg's failure to retain the title, Misimoviƒá continued with his excellent performances, recording 15 assists, two short of Mesut √ñzil. He also bagged 10 goals, equaling his personal best in top flight first set with N√ºrnberg in 2007‚Äì08 season. For the 2010‚Äì11 season, the arrival of playmaker Diego made Misimoviƒá's future at the club uncertain. Despite appearing in the 2‚Äì1 away defeat to Bayern Munich in season's opener, he left the club in the last day of summer transfer window, opting to join Galatasaray S.K. in Turkey. Misimoviƒá concluded his two-year spell at Wolfsburg by making 92 appearances in all competitions and scoring 25 goals. ===Galatasaray=== On 31 August 2010, Galatasaray announced that Misimoviƒá had joined the team on a four-year contract for a sum of ‚Ç¨7 million. He played his first match for the team on 13 September against Gaziantepspor. Despite initially becoming an undisputed starter, on 18 November 2010, Misimoviƒá was consigned to the reserve squad, as the head coach Gheorghe Hagi stated that he \\"didn't need him in the squad\\". He left the club in March 2011 after a disappointing spell, having made only nine appearances. ===Dynamo Moscow=== On 3 March 2011, Misimoviƒá signed for Russian club Dynamo Moscow in a deal thought to be worth ‚Ç¨4.5 million. The deal was until 2014. Before leaving Galatasaray, Misimoviƒá called coach Gheorghe Hagi \\"a liar\\", but added that he wished his former club all the best. Misimoviƒá made his competitive debut for the team on 12 March 2011 in a league match against Lokomotiv Moscow, while his first goal came in the next match against Rostov, netting a penalty kick in a 3‚Äì1 home win. Misimoviƒá concluded his first season in Russia by scoring ten goals in all competitions; he scored eight goals in league, including the winner against CSKA Moscow in April 2012. In 2011‚Äì12 Russian Cup, he scored the lone goal of the quarter-final match against Zenit Saint Petersburg, before scoring the winner in the semi-final against Volga Nizhny Novgorod, sending his team to the final. Both goals came in the same manner ‚Äì from penalty kicks in the 73rd minute. In the final, Misimoviƒá played for 82 minutes, but Dynamo was defeated 1‚Äì0 by Rubin Kazan. ===Guizhou Renhe=== On 4 January 2013, Misimoviƒá signed a contract for three years with his new club. Between 22 March and 3 April 2013, Misimoviƒá played three games on three continents. In March 2015, Misimoviƒá announced that he would retire from professional football, aged 32. However, he made his return to Guizhou Renhe in June 2015. He announced his retirement again on 8 January 2017. ==International career== ===Youth=== Misimoviƒá played for the FR Yugoslavia under-18 national squad, appearing for them at the 2001 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship held in Finland. In that team, he played alongside Nemanja Vidiƒá and Danko Lazoviƒá. Misimoviƒá later progressed to the FR Yugoslavia under-21 national team, but appeared in only one match as the 85th- minute substitute against France in November 2002. Head coach of the under-21s at the time Vladimir Petroviƒá Pi≈æon soon dropped Misimoviƒá, telling him he was overweight and slow. ===Senior=== By late 2003 and early 2004, 21-year-old Misimoviƒá was still not attached to any senior national team. He was approached in the club's gym by then teammate at Bayern Munich, Hasan Salihamid≈æiƒá, about a possibility of playing for Bosnia and Herzegovina national team. Misimoviƒá immediately accepted and debuted for Bosnia under head coach Bla≈æ Sli≈°koviƒá on 18 February 2004 in a friendly match against Macedonia. ===2006 World Cup qualification=== Misimoviƒá was used sparingly by Sli≈°koviƒá during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. He played the full 90 minutes in the opening home draws against Spain and Serbia and Montenegro, followed by a substitute appearance in the away loss to Belgium. Misimoviƒá then enjoyed a spell as a consistent starter before being substituted 10‚Äì20 minutes into the second half, in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Lithuania (scored the opening goal), the away win at San Marino, and finally the 1‚Äì1 draw against Spain in Valencia (again scored the opening goal before Spain tied deep into injury-time in the 96th minute). For the deciding four qualifiers (home win against Belgium, the away win at Lithuania, home victory over San Marino, and the away defeat to Serbia and Montenegro), Sli≈°koviƒá dropped Misimoviƒá to the bench, bringing him into action only in the final 15‚Äì20 minutes of each tie. ===Euro 2008 qualifying=== UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying began in fall 2006 with Sli≈°koviƒá still team manager and 24-year- old Misimoviƒá an established starter and goalscorer. The opening match dismantling of Malta was followed by the shocking 1‚Äì3 defeat to Hungary at home that prompted Sli≈°koviƒá's resignation, which he retracted a couple of weeks later and stayed on. Still, more disappointment was to follow with a 2‚Äì2 draw at lowly Moldova, as Misimoviƒá sparked a comeback that ultimately fell short by scoring a goal at 2‚Äì0 down. Four days later, Bosnia were heavily defeated 0‚Äì4 by Greece at home, forcing Sli≈°koviƒá to resign for the second time in three months ‚Äì this time for good. As the winter break in qualifying commenced, the Bosnian team was in crisis mode with relations inside the organization strained to the maximum. This led to thirteen Bosnian national team players (Misimoviƒá, D≈æemal Berberoviƒá, Vladan Grujiƒá, Mladen Bartoloviƒá, Mirko Hrgoviƒá, Zlatan Bajramoviƒá, Sa≈°a Papac, Emir Spahiƒá, Ninoslav Milenkoviƒá, Ivica Grliƒá, Mirsad Be≈°lija, Kenan Hasagiƒá and Almir Tolja) releasing what was reported as a signed joint statement in protest. Published in the Dnevni Avaz daily in late October 2006 as a press release, the statement announces the players' intention to boycott all national team matches until four FA officials ‚Äì Milan Jeliƒá, Iljo Dominkoviƒá, Sulejman ƒåolakoviƒá, and Ahmet Pa≈°aliƒá ‚Äì resigned. Some two months later, in late December 2006, new head coach Fuad Muzuroviƒá was announced. In relation to the boycott statement, Misimoviƒá soon did a complete turnaround, denying that he ever signed any such paper and stating that his relations with the FA had always been amicable. Under new head coach Muzuroviƒá, Misimoviƒá truly came into his own, earning the national team captaincy. ====Six months under Meho Kodro==== After Meho Kodro replaced Muzuroviƒá as head coach in early January 2008, one of the changes he introduced was stripping Misimoviƒá of the captain's armband and handing it to twenty-seven-year-old defender Emir Spahiƒá who had just returned to the national team after boycotting it since fall 2006. On 8 April 2008, Misimoviƒá (then still only 25 years old) announced his retirement from the national team, citing stating health concerns as he no longer felt able to keep up the physical rigors of playing for both club and country. However, many speculated that health had little to do with Misimoviƒá's sudden announcement. These suspicions were seemingly confirmed two days later by Bosnian national team general manager Elvir Boliƒá who hinted that Misimoviƒá might have softened his original stance and revealed that head coach Meho Kodro would travel to Germany to visit the player personally and discuss the \\"real reasons\\" for his decision. On 12 April 2008, after speaking to Kodro, Misimoviƒá changed his mind and the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina (NSBiH) announced that he had decided to continue his international career. ===2010 World Cup qualification=== Under the next head coach ƒÜiro Bla≈æeviƒá during 2010 World Cup qualification process, Misimoviƒá asserted himself as the team's undisputed leader on the pitch, displaying great playmaking abilities and leadership qualities. His fine performances began with a hat-trick in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Estonia on 10 September 2008. Bosnia finished the group in second place thus qualifying for the playoffs against Portugal in November 2009. However, the qualifying campaign ended on a sour note both for Misimoviƒá personally and for the team. Misimoviƒá had a poor outing in the first leg away in Lisbon and was widely criticized for his sub- par performance, even by head coach Bla≈æeviƒá who publicly blasted the midfield creator for lack of contribution. The coach especially scolded him for two instances of losing possession in the middle of the pitch that resulted in respective Elvir Rahimiƒá and Emir Spahiƒá defensive tackles in order to prevent a Portuguese counterattack, both of which led to yellow cards that meant an automatic one-match suspension for each player for the return leg. Two days after the first leg (and two days before the 18 November 2009 return leg in Zenica), Misimoviƒá was ruled out by medical staff due to an apparent knee injury he picked up during the first leg. Controversy arose three days later on 21 November 2009 when he played the full 90 minutes for VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga leading to veiled accusations in the Bosnian media that he faked the injury to get back at Bla≈æeviƒá. Head coach Bla≈æeviƒá went further, directly accusing Misimoviƒá of sabotaging him. Bla≈æeviƒá even went as far as alluding to Misimoviƒá's Serb ethnicity; suggesting a conspiracy \\"on instructions from Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik and the Serbian lobby because Republika Srpska would lose everything if Bosnia qualified for the World Cup\\". When informed of Bla≈æeviƒá's comments, a stunned Misimoviƒá responded that he would not play for Bosnia and Herzegovina as long as Bla≈æeviƒá remained as the head coach, and further accused Bla≈æeviƒá of scapegoating him in order to deflect attention from the fact that the team was thoroughly outplayed by Portugal in both matches. Even though he stated his intention to leave even before Misimoviƒá's latest words, Bla≈æeviƒá's response was a claim that he will leave the post because \\"Misimoviƒá is more important to this team than I am\\". The next day, Bla≈æeviƒá suddenly announced that he had supposedly resolved his differences with the player after apparently calling to congratulate the birth of his son, but this reconciliation was denied by Misimoviƒá two weeks later. Bla≈æeviƒá even announced his intent to travel to Wolfsburg for the Champions League group stage match between VfL Wolfsburg and Manchester United in order to visit Misimoviƒá personally, but ended up not doing so. Within days, Bla≈æeviƒá resigned as the head coach of Bosnia, revealing that he took an offer from China, and in his parting shot once again he singled out Misimoviƒá as the reason why Bosnia did not qualify for the 2010 World Cup. ===Euro 2012 qualifying=== Misimoviƒá during a penalty kick vs. Greece Misimoviƒá played his 51st match for the national team against Luxembourg in September 2010, thereby equaling Elvir Boliƒá's record for most caps for Bosnia. Misimoviƒá surpassed Boliƒá in a match against France in Sarajevo on 7 September, making him the most capped player in the history of the national team with 52 matches played. Bosnia failed to qualify for Euro 2012 after losing a two-legged playoff against Portugal. Misimoviƒá scored a goal from a penalty kick in Lisbon. ===2014 World Cup=== Misimoviƒá made two assists for Edin D≈æeko in a victory over Greece in Zenica. Local media compared this situation to the way they played together in VfL Wolfsburg. His penalty kick against Greece was saved by goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, but teammate Vedad Ibi≈°eviƒá managed to convert the rebound for a score of 3‚Äì0 (final score was 3‚Äì1 in stoppage time). Bosnia went on to qualify for the first finals tournament as an independent nation after topping their group on goal difference, and head-to-head. Misimoviƒá and Bosnia faced Argentina in the first match of the world cup. Almost three minutes into the game, a free kick from Lionel Messi flicked on by Marcos Rojo, was deflected into the net for an own goal by Sead Kola≈°inac. It was the fastest own goal in the history of the World Cup. In the next half, Messi scored from the edge of the penalty area, tucking the ball into the bottom-right corner. Misimoviƒá was substituted 11 minutes later. With five minutes of the match remaining, Ibi≈°eviƒá scored after a pass from Senad Luliƒá, which was Bosnia's first ever World Cup-goal. The match ended 2‚Äì1. In the next deciding match, against Nigeria, Misimoviƒá played the on the pitch for the entire match. A goal from D≈æeko was controversially deemed offside, as replays seemed to show that his goal should have stood. Instead, Nigeria took the lead in the 29th minute with a goal from Peter Odemwingie. Bosnia pushed on for the equalizer, and a shot from D≈æeko was deflected onto the post by Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama in stoppage time. Nigeria won the match, which effectively eliminated Bosnia from the tournament with a match to spare. Misimoviƒá was dropped for the last match against Iran, and Bosnia went on to earn their first ever win in a World Cup tournament. In August 2014, following his first and only World Cup, Misimoviƒá announced his permanent retirement from the national team. ==Personal life== Misimoviƒá is an ethnic Serb, and an Orthodox Christian. His nicknames are Miske, and Zwetschge (\\"plum\\"). His favourite team is Red Star Belgrade, a team which he has said he would love to retire in. Misimoviƒá's wife, Stefanija, is from Strumica, Macedonia. The couple have three sons together: Luka (born 2004), Niko (born 2009) and Noel (born 2013). ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Source: {| class=\\"wikitable\\"  |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Season !colspan=\\"3\\"|League !colspan=\\"2\\"|Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"|Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"|Other !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\\"5\\"|Bayern Munich II ||2000‚Äì01 |rowspan=\\"4\\"|Regionalliga S√ºd |12||1||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||12||1 |- ||2001‚Äì02 |31||14||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||31||14 |- ||2002‚Äì03 |28||8||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||28||8 |- ||2003‚Äì04 |31||21||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî||31||21 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !102!!44!!colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî!!colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî!!colspan=\\"2\\"|‚Äî!!102!!44 |- |rowspan=\\"3\\"|Bayern Munich ||2002‚Äì03 |rowspan=\\"2\\"|Bundesliga |1||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ||2003‚Äì04 |2||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !3!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!5!!0 |- |rowspan=\\"4\\"|VfL Bochum ||2004‚Äì05 |rowspan=\\"1\\"|Bundesliga |31||3||2||1||2All appearance(s) in UEFA Cup||0||1Appearance in DFL-Ligapokal||0||36||4 |- ||2005‚Äì06 |rowspan=\\"1\\"|2.

On the Bosnian and Herzegovinian football association page it says 26 goals which is incorrect. For the game Bosnia vs Turkey during qualifiers for UEFA EURO 2008, the website shows (see ref link at date 2 June 2007) that Misimoviƒá scored a goal, but in fact it was his teammate Muslimoviƒá who scored, as Misimoviƒá was not a scorer in that game. He has also played one extra game due to a duplication error on the website of the same match. In addition, Misimoviƒá did not score a goal against Lithuania on 30 March 2005, rather it was his teammate Elvir Boliƒá with shirt number 7.

He served in the French army during World War II, and was taken prisoner in 1940, composing works such as Chant des captifs while incarcerated. Among his other compositions are four symphonies, four concertos, additional choral works and chamber music. After the war, Martinon was appointed conductor of the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire of Paris, and, in 1946, of the Bordeaux Philharmonic Orchestra. On Martinon's first visit to Dublin in March 1946, his interpretation of Debussy's La Mer (the Irish premiere of the work) was described as ‚Äòa musical event of real importance‚Äô.\\"Irish Press\\", 2, 1 April 1946. The success of that first concert led Radio √âireann (the Irish public broadcasting service) to engage him in the following year to assist in the selection of musicians and the general organisation of the newly constituted Radio √âireann Symphony Orchestra. While in Dublin Martinon encouraged the development of Our Lady's Choral Society, he conducted that choir in several important events with the radio orchestra, and he gave master classes in orchestral conducting and in composition in the Summer School of Music.Joe Kehoe, ‚ÄòMaestro, Magician, Midwife: Jean Martinon in Dublin,‚Äô in \\"Notes and Narratives: France and Ireland\\", Una Hunt and Mary Pierse (eds), (Oxford: Peter Lang, 2015) 199‚Äì215. Other orchestras with which he was associated were the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as music director from 1963 to 1968; the D√ºsseldorfer Symphoniker, the French National Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Concerts Lamoureux and Het Residentie Orkest in The Hague. Martinon's repertoire focused on the works of early twentieth century French and Russian composers. The premieres of his violin- and cello-concerti were given by Henryk Szeryng and Pierre Fournier respectively. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity.Delta Omicron Martinon was diagnosed with bone cancer, not long after he guest conducted the San Francisco Symphony in their first complete performances of Deryck Cooke's completion of Gustav Mahler's tenth symphony.San Francisco Chronicle He died in Paris. == Compositions == * Published Scores | 1935-1974 **Apr√®s ma journ√©e faite Op.26, (1940) **Ballade du soldat incassable Op.40 No.2, (1945) **Concerto (No.1) \\"giocoso\\" pour violon et orchestre Op.18, (1937) **Concerto \\"lyrique\\" pour un quatuor a cordes solo et un orchestre de 36 musiciens, Op.38, (1962) **Concerto pour flute et orchestre, (1971) **Concerto pour quatuor de saxophones Op.38b, (1974) **Concerto pour violoncelle et orchestre, Op.52, (1967) **Concerto No.2 pour violon et orchestre, Op.51, (1963) **Divertissement pour orchestre -reduit-, (1942) **Dom√©non, ou, Musique pour quintette √† vent, (1970) **Duo -musique en forme de sonate- pour violon et piano Op.47, (1959) **Epilogue d'un conte d'amour -berceuse- pour piano, Op.35 No.1, (1947) **Les horizons perdus pour chant et piano, (1946) **Humanit√© (Les Soirs) pour chant et piano Op.12, (1940) **Hymne, variations et rondo Op.56, (1961/1968) **Introduction et toccata Op.45, (1947) **Mon plus joli r√™ve, (1946?) **Musique d'exil, Op.31, (1941) **Ouverture pour trag√©die grecque Op.47, (1951) **Paysage ant√©rieur pour chant et piano, Op.25 No.1, (1940) **Psaume CXXXVI (Chant des captifs), Op.33, (1946) **Psaume 136 (Chant des captifs) pour chant et piano avec choeurs, Op.33, (1946) **Quatuor a cordes No.1 Op.43, (1946) **Quatuor a cordes No.2 Op.54, (1966) **Rapsodie 72 pour alto et piano, (1972) **Sonatine No.1 pour violin et piano Op.19 No.1, (1935) **Sonatine (No.1) vers. pour clarinette et piano Op.19 No.1b, (1935/1968) **Sonatine No.2 pour violin et piano Op.19 No.2, (1936) **Sonatine (No.2) vers. pour flute et piano Op.19 No.2b, (1936/1968) **Sonatine No.3 pour piano, Op.22, (1946?) **Sonatine No.4 pour trio d'anches Op.26 No.1, (1940) **Sonatine No.5 pour violon solo, Op.32 No.1, (1942) **Sonatine No.6 pour violon solo, Op.49 No.2, (1960) **Sonatine \\"a la lune qui s'en va\\" pour chant et piano, Op.10 No.3, (1946?) **Suite nocturne pour violin et piano Op.34, (1944) **Symphoniette pour orchestre √† cordes, piano, harpe, et timbales, (1952) **Symphonie No.3 \\"Irlandaise\\" Op.45, (1948) **Symphonie No.4 \\"Altitudes\\" Op.53, (1965) **Trio a cordes Op.32 No.2, (1943) **Trois chansons Op.20, (1938) *Unpublished Scores | 1935-1975 **Absolve, Domine -motet- pour 4 voix d'hommes et orchestre sp√©cial, Op.30, (1942) **Ambohimanga, ou La cit√© bleue -ballet radiophonique-, Op.42, (1949) **Appel de parfums -ch≈ìur- √† 4 voix d'hommes, Op.28 No.2, (1941) **183eme Concerto - Parodic composition written for violinist Andr√© Proffit's 40th birthday-, (1943) **Concerto giocoso pour violon et orchestre, Op.18, (1937) **Concerto \\"lyrique\\", Op.38a, (1944) **Concerto pour alto Op.18b, (1937) **Concerto pour cello et orchestre Op.52, (1963) **Concerto pour flute et orchestre, (1971) **Concerto pour quatuor de saxophones, (1974) **Concerto No.2 pour violon et orchestre Op.51, (1958) **D√©chiffrage pour hautbois, n.d. **Fanfare en rondo Op.40, (1946) **H√©cube Op.46, (1949) **Hymne variation et rondo, (1961/1968) **Introduzione adagio et passacaglia Op.55, (1966) **Le lis de Saron ou le cantique de cantiques Op.48, (1952) **Motet pour quatre voix mixtes Op.28 No.4, (1940) **Octour Op.57, (1969) **Ode au soleil ne de la mort, (1945) **Pr√©lude et toccata, Op.50, (1961) **En promenade, n.d. **Quatuor a cordes No.1 Op.43, (1946) **Rapsodie 72 pour alto et piano Op.60, (1971) **Romance bleue -rapsodie de concert- pour violon solo et orchestre, (1942) **Sonatine br√®ve, (1965) **Sonatine pour clarinette et piano, (1972) **Suite enchain√©e pour 11 cordes et clavecin, (1975) **Suite nocturne pour violon et piano, Op.34, (1946) **Symphonie en ut Op.17, (1934/1936) **Symphonie No.2 \\"Hymne a la Vie\\" Op.37, (1944) **Symphonie No.3 \\"Irlandaise\\" Op.45, (1948) **Symphonie No.4 \\"Altitudes\\" (originaux) Op.53, (1965) **Symphonie No.4 \\"Altitudes\\" (corrections) Op.53, (1965) **Symphonie No.4 \\"Altitudes\\" (new coda final) Op.53, (1965) **Symphonie de voyages Op.49 No.1, (1956) **Symphoniette Op.16, (1935) **Trio a cordes Op.32 No.2, (1943) **Trois nouvelles chansons Op.36, (1968) **Vigintour No.1 Op.58, (1968) * Scores (Arrangements) | 1946-1969 **Grande fugue, (1969) **Magnificat, n.d. **Moto perpetuo, n.d. **S√©r√©nade, (1946) == References == == External links == * * Jean Martinon's Papers at the Northwestern University Music Library website. * Jean Martinon biography at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra website.

This basic shape is then used to sculpt out the final model. The process uses a number of repetitive steps to reach the final product, which can lead to a more efficient and more controlled modelling process. ==Subdivision== Subdivision modeling is derived from the idea that as a work is progressed, should the artist want to make their work appear less sharp, or \\"blocky\\", each face would be divided up into smaller, more detailed faces (usually into sets of four). However, more experienced box modelers manage to create their model without subdividing the faces of the model. Basically, box modeling is broken down into the very basic concept of polygonal management. ==Quads== Quadrilateral faces, commonly named \\"quads\\", are the fundamental entity in box modeling. If an artist were to start with a cube, the artist would have six quad faces to work with before extrusion. While most applications for three-dimensional art provide abilities for faces up to any size, results are often more predictable and consistent when working with quads. This is so because if one were to draw an X connecting the corner vertices of a quad, the surface normal is nearly always the same. We say nearly because, when a quad is something other than a perfect parallelogram (such as a rhombus or trapezoid), the surface normal would be different. Also, a quad subdivides into two or four triangles cleanly, making it easier to prepare the model for software that can only handle triangles. ==Advantages and disadvantages== Box modeling is a modeling method that is quick and easy to learn. It is also appreciably faster than placing each point individually. However, it is difficult to add high amounts of detail to models created using this technique without practice. ==References== Category:3D computer graphics ","title":"Box modeling"},{"id":"1996494","text":"Magnus Erlingmark (born 8 July 1968 in J√∂nk√∂ping) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a defender.

He started his career as a soldier under the warlord Sun Quan sometime towards the end of the Han dynasty, and was commissioned as an officer for his courage in battle. He served as a subordinate of various generals under Sun Quan, including Gan Ning, Lu Xun and Pan Zhang. He fought in many wars for his lord and was well known for his valour. He was also wounded in battle several times and had slain many enemy commanders and captured the enemy's flags.

The Wu generals said: \\"When the enemy learns that the Grand Tutor (Zhuge Ke) is coming here personally, they will surely retreat when we reach the shore.\\" However, only Ding Feng had a different view: \\"No. They are making large movements in their territory. They are prepared, as they have mobilised large numbers of troops from Xuchang and Luoyang, so why would they go back empty-handed? Don't think that the enemy won't come. We should ready ourselves for battle.\\" When Zhuge Ke reached Dongxing, he placed Ding Feng, Liu Zan (), L√º Ju and Tang Zi in charge of the vanguard and they moved west along mountainous terrain. Ding Feng warned: \\"We are moving too slow. If the enemy seizes favourable ground, it will be harder to deal with them.\\" He then led 3,000 soldiers with him, travelling on a different route from the main bulk of Wu forces.(Ë´∏Â∞áÁöÜÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊïµËÅûÂ§™ÂÇÖËá™‰æÜÔºå‰∏äÂ≤∏ÂøÖÈÅÅËµ∞„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ•âÁç®Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏çÁÑ∂„ÄÇÂΩºÂãïÂÖ∂Â¢ÉÂÖßÔºåÊÇâË®±„ÄÅÊ¥õÂÖµÂ§ßËàâËÄå‰æÜÔºåÂøÖÊúâÊàêË¶èÔºåË±àËôõÈÇÑÂìâÔºüÁÑ°ÊÅÉÊïµ‰πã‰∏çËá≥ÔºåÊÅÉÂêæÊúâ‰ª•Âãù‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÂèäÊÅ™‰∏äÂ≤∏ÔºåÂ•âËàáÂ∞áËªçÂîêÂí®„ÄÅÂëÇÊìö„ÄÅÁïôË¥äÁ≠âÔºå‰ø±ÂæûÂ±±Ë•ø‰∏ä„ÄÇÂ•âÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäË´∏ËªçË°åÈÅ≤ÔºåËã•ÊïµÊìö‰æøÂú∞ÔºåÂâáÈõ£ËàáÁà≠ÈãíÁü£„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉËæüË´∏Ëªç‰Ωø‰∏ãÈÅìÔºåÂ∏•È∫æ‰∏ã‰∏âÂçÉ‰∫∫ÂæëÈÄ≤„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. Strong north winds were blowing at that time. Ding Feng and his 3,000 men reached the frontline within two days and seized control of Xu Embankment (). It was in winter and there was snowfall. The Wei officers were off guard and having a drinking session, so, despite the feeble size of his army, Ding Feng rallied his men and said: \\"Today is the day we claim titles and rewards!\\" He then ordered his troops to remove their armour and helmets, discard their jis and spears, and arm themselves with only shields and short weapons such as swords. The Wei soldiers laughed when they saw this event, and instead refused to ready themselves for combat. Ding Feng and his men fought bravely and destroyed the enemy camp at the front. Just then, another Wu force led by L√º Ju and a few others arrived, therefore joining Ding Feng in attacking the enemy camp.

They encountered Wei forces pursuing Wen Qin at Gaoting () and engaged the enemy in battle.

In 257, another rebellion led by the Wei general Zhuge Dan broke out in Shouchun again. Zhuge Dan requested aid from Wu and the Wu regent Sun Chen agreed. Sima Zhao personally led the Wei armies to suppress the revolt and they attempted to surround Shouchun. Sun Chen ordered Zhu Yi and Tang Zi to help Zhuge Dan, and later sent Li Fei () and Ding Feng to lift the siege on Shouchun. Ding Feng stationed at Lijiang () and he fought bravely in battle even though the rebellion was eventually crushed by Wei forces and the Wu army sustained heavy losses. Despite the failure of the campaign, Ding Feng was still held in high regard in Wu, as he was subsequently appointed as General of the Left ().(Â§™Âπ≥‰∫åÂπ¥ÔºåÈ≠èÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçË´∏ËëõË™ïÊìöÂ£ΩÊò•‰æÜÈôçÔºåÈ≠è‰∫∫Âúç‰πã„ÄÇÈÅ£Êú±Áï∞„ÄÅÂîêÂí®Á≠âÂæÄÊïëÔºåÂæ©‰ΩøÂ•âËàáÈªéÊñêËß£Âúç„ÄÇÂ•âÁÇ∫ÂÖàÁôªÔºåÂ±ØÊñºÈªéÊºøÔºåÂäõÊà∞ÊúâÂäüÔºåÊãúÂ∑¶Â∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. ==Service under Sun Xiu== In 258, Sun Chen deposed the second Wu emperor Sun Liang and replaced the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, \\"Ding Feng may not be proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions.\\" Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng and told him: \\"Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want you to help me eliminate him.\\" Ding Feng replied: \\"The Imperial Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court is on our side. We cannot confront them directly. I suggest that Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival.\\" Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen stepped inside, Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him.

In 259, Ding Feng was appointed as the nominal Governor of Xu Province. In 263, when the state of Wei launched a campaign to conquer Wu's ally Shu, Ding Feng led the Wu forces to attack Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui) in an attempt to divert Wei attention away from Shu. However, it was too late as the Shu emperor Liu Shan had already surrendered to Wei, marking the end of Shu.

During this time, when his colleagues recommended people to him, he would publicly reveal what they told him in private before giving jobs to the people they recommended. When he evaluated officials' performance, he would take into account what others said regardless of whether it was positive or negative.

Later, someone told the Wei emperor Cao Rui that Zhuge Dan and his friends, along with other \\"celebrities\\", were engaging in superficial and fame-seeking behaviour.

Sima Shi personally led Wei imperial forces to deal with the rebels. He ordered Zhuge Dan to lead troops from Yu Province and advance to Shouchun via Anfeng Ford (). After Sima Shi quelled the revolt, Zhuge Dan and his forces were the first to enter Shouchun. By then, the civilian population of Shouchun, numbering over 100,000, had fled into the countryside or escaped to Eastern Wu for fear of being killed.(Â§ßÂ∞áËªçÂè∏È¶¨ÊôØÁéãÊù±ÂæÅÔºå‰ΩøË™ïÁù£Ë±´Â∑ûË´∏ËªçÔºåÊ∏°ÂÆâÈ¢®Ê¥•ÂêëÂ£ΩÊò•„ÄÇÂÑâ„ÄÅÊ¨Ω‰πãÁ†¥‰πüÔºåË™ïÂÖàËá≥Â£ΩÊò•„ÄÇÂ£ΩÊò•‰∏≠ÂçÅÈ§òËê¨Âè£ÔºåËÅûÂÑâ„ÄÅÊ¨ΩÊïóÔºåÊÅêË™ÖÔºåÊÇâÁ†¥ÂüéÈñÄÂá∫ÔºåÊµÅËø∏Â±±Êæ§ÔºåÊàñÊï£Ëµ∞ÂÖ•Âê¥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. The Wei imperial court appointed Zhuge Dan as Senior General Who Guards the East (), with honours equivalent to those of the Three Ducal Ministers, and ordered him to oversee military affairs in Yang Province. Earlier on, when news of Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin's rebellion reached Eastern Wu, the Wu regent Sun Jun, along with L√º Ju, Liu Zan and others, had led Wu forces to Shouchun to support the rebels. However, by the time they showed up, Wei forces had recaptured Shouchun so the Wu forces retreated. Zhuge Dan sent his subordinate Jiang Ban () to lead troops to attack the retreating Wu forces. Jiang Ban killed Liu Zan in the ensuing battle and obtained his official seal. For his achievements, Zhuge Dan was promoted from a village marquis to a county marquis ‚Äì \\"Marquis of Gaoping (County)\\" () ‚Äì and awarded 3,500 taxable households to form his marquisate.

Thus, when he was stationed in Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui), he attempted to increase his popularity among the masses in the Huai River area by being very generous.

Around the winter of 256, Zhuge Dan found an excuse to entrench himself further in Shouchun and build up his defences.

Jia Chong suggested to Sima Zhao to keep a close watch on the generals who were guarding strategic locations throughout the Wei Empire and assess whether they were loyal to him. Sima Zhao heeded his words and sent him to Shouchun to meet Zhuge Dan. Jia Chong told Zhuge Dan, \\"Many wise men in Luoyang hope to see the Emperor abdicate in favour of a better ruler. You already know this. What do you think?\\" Zhuge Dan replied sternly, \\"Aren't you Inspector Jia's son? The State has treated your family generously for generations.

While the order ostensibly promoted Zhuge Dan to a prestigious ministerial office (one of the Three Ducal Ministers, in fact), it was actually a move to remove him from power in Shouchun and put him under Sima Zhao's control in Luoyang. ===Rising in revolt=== When Zhuge Dan received the order, he knew that Sima Zhao was suspicious of him and became fearful. According to the Shiyu, he suspected that Yue Lin (), the Inspector () of Yang Province, had instigated Sima Zhao to remove him from power in Shouchun and summon him to Luoyang. He then led a few hundred soldiers to Yue Lin's office to kill him. When he arrived, he saw that the gates were closed so he shouted at the guards, \\"Weren't you my subordinates last time?\\" He then forced his way in and killed Yue Lin.(Êõ∏Ëá≥ÔºåË™ïÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàë‰ΩúÂÖ¨Áï∂Âú®ÁéãÊñáËàíÂæåÔºå‰ªä‰æøÁÇ∫Âè∏Á©∫ÔºÅ‰∏çÈÅ£‰ΩøËÄÖÔºåÂÅ•Ê≠•ÈΩéÊõ∏Ôºå‰Ωø‰ª•ÂÖµ‰ªòÊ®ÇÁ∂ùÔºåÊ≠§ÂøÖÁ∂ùÊâÄÁÇ∫„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂ∞áÂ∑¶Âè≥Êï∏Áôæ‰∫∫Ëá≥ÊèöÂ∑ûÔºåÊèöÂ∑û‰∫∫Ê¨≤ÈñâÈñÄÔºåË™ïÂè±Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂçøÈùûÊàëÊïÖÂêèÈÇ™ÔºÅ„ÄçÂæëÂÖ•ÔºåÁ∂ùÈÄÉ‰∏äÊ®ìÔºåÂ∞±Êñ¨‰πã„ÄÇ) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28. Another account from the Wei Mo Zhuan () mentioned that Zhuge Dan hosted a party after receiving the order and lied that he wanted to take a day off from work and go outside Shouchun. He brought along 700 soldiers with him. When Yue Lin heard about it, he ordered the city gates to be shut. Zhuge Dan then ordered his men to force the gates open, set fire to the Inspector's office, and killed Yue Lin. He then wrote a memorial to the imperial court, accusing Yue Lin of secretly collaborating with Eastern Wu and claiming that he executed Yue Lin after discovering his treachery.

They also enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Shouchun ().(Âê¥‰∫∫Â§ßÂñúÔºåÈÅ£Â∞áÂÖ®Êáå„ÄÅÂÖ®Á´Ø„ÄÅÂîêÂí®„ÄÅÁéãÁ•öÁ≠âÔºåÁéá‰∏âËê¨Ë°ÜÔºåÂØÜËàáÊñáÊ¨Ω‰ø±‰æÜÊáâË™ï„ÄÇ‰ª•Ë™ïÁÇ∫Â∑¶ÈÉΩË≠∑„ÄÅÂÅáÁØÄ„ÄÅÂ§ßÂè∏Âæí„ÄÅÈ©ÉÈ®éÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÈùíÂ∑ûÁâß„ÄÅÂ£ΩÊò•‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. ===Battles=== Among the various Wei imperial forces sent to suppress Zhuge Dan's rebellion, the army led by Wang Ji arrived at Shouchun first and started to surround the city. Before the encirclement was complete, the Wu forces led by Tang Zi and Wen Qin managed to cut across mountainous terrain in the northeast of Shouchun and enter the city to meet up with Zhuge Dan.(ÊòØÊôÇÈéÆÂçóÂ∞áËªçÁéãÂü∫ÂßãËá≥ÔºåÁù£Ë´∏ËªçÂúçÂ£ΩÊò•ÔºåÊú™Âêà„ÄÇÂí®„ÄÅÊ¨ΩÁ≠âÂæûÂüéÊù±ÂåóÔºåÂõ†Â±±‰πòÈö™ÔºåÂæóÂ∞áÂÖ∂Ë°ÜÁ™ÅÂÖ•Âüé„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Around July 258, Sima Zhao reached Xiang County (È†ÖÁ∏£; present-day Shenqiu County, Henan), where he took overall command of the 260,000 troops mobilised from throughout the Wei Empire to suppress the rebellion, and advanced towards Shouchun. He remained at Qiutou (), while sending Wang Ji and Chen Qian () to surround Shouchun and reinforce their encirclement with defensive structures such as earth walls and moats. At the same time, he also ordered Shi Bao () and Zhou Tai to lead some troops to patrol the perimeter and guard against any forces coming to help Zhuge Dan. When Wen Qin and others attempted to break out of the siege, they were driven back by the Wei forces.(ÂÖ≠ÊúàÔºåËªäÈßïÊù±ÂæÅÔºåËá≥È†Ö„ÄÇÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂè∏È¶¨ÊñáÁéãÁù£‰∏≠Â§ñË´∏Ëªç‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ≠Ëê¨Ë°ÜÔºåËá®Ê∑ÆË®é‰πã„ÄÇÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂ±Ø‰∏òÈ†≠„ÄÇ‰ΩøÂü∫ÂèäÂÆâÊù±Â∞áËªçÈô≥È®´Á≠âÂõõÈù£ÂêàÂúçÔºåË°®Ë£èÂÜçÈáçÔºåÂ£çÂ£òÁîöÂ≥ª„ÄÇÂèà‰ΩøÁõ£ËªçÁü≥Ëãû„ÄÅÂÖñÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤Â∑ûÊ≥∞Á≠âÔºåÁ∞°Èä≥ÂçíÁÇ∫Ê∏∏ËªçÔºåÂÇôÂ§ñÂØá„ÄÇÊ¨ΩÁ≠âÊï∏Âá∫ÁäØÂúçÔºåÈÄÜÊìäËµ∞‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. The Wu general Zhu Yi led another force to Shouchun to assist Zhuge Dan. Zhou Tai attacked Zhu Yi at Lijiang () and defeated him. The Wu regent Sun Chen was furious with Zhu Yi's failure and had him executed.(Âê¥Â∞áÊú±Áï∞ÂÜç‰ª•Â§ßË°Ü‰æÜËøéË™ïÁ≠âÔºåÊ∏°ÈªéÊºøÊ∞¥ÔºåÊ≥∞Á≠âÈÄÜËàáÊà∞ÔºåÊØèÊëßÂÖ∂Èãí„ÄÇÂ≠´Á∂ù‰ª•Áï∞Êà∞‰∏çÈÄ≤ÔºåÊÄíËÄåÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. ===Defections=== After some time, Shouchun gradually ran low on supplies and became increasingly isolated from the outside world. Two of Zhuge Dan's close aides, Jiang Ban () and Jiao Yi (), told their general: \\"Zhu Yi came with a large army but failed to achieve anything. Sun Chen executed Zhu Yi and returned to Jiangdong. He is actually putting on a front when he sent troops to help us. His decision to turn back already shows that he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Now, since our troops are still high on morale and eager to fight, we should focus all efforts on breaking one side of the siege. Even if we cannot drive back the enemy, we can at least allow some of our forces to escape and survive.\\"(Êº¢ÊôâÊò•ÁßãÊõ∞ÔºöËî£Áè≠„ÄÅÁÑ¶ÂΩùË®ÄÊñºË´∏ËëõË™ïÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊú±Áï∞Á≠â‰ª•Â§ßË°Ü‰æÜËÄå‰∏çËÉΩÈÄ≤ÔºåÂ≠´Á∂ùÊÆ∫Áï∞ËÄåÊ≠∏Ê±üÊù±ÔºåÂ§ñ‰ª•ÁôºÂÖµÁÇ∫ÂêçÔºåËÄåÂÖßÂØ¶ÂùêÈ†àÊàêÊïóÔºåÂÖ∂Ê≠∏ÂèØË¶ãÁü£„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÆúÂèäË°ÜÂøÉÂ∞öÂõ∫ÔºåÂ£´ÂçíÊÄùÁî®ÔºåÂπ∂ÂäõÊ±∫Ê≠ªÔºåÊîªÂÖ∂‰∏ÄÈù£ÔºåÈõñ‰∏çËÉΩÁõ°ÂÖãÔºåÁå∂ÂèØÊúâÂÖ®ËÄÖ„ÄÇ„Äç) Han Jin Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28. Wen Qin disagreed and told Zhuge Dan, \\"Jiangdong forces are known for having scored victories; their enemies in the north can't stop them. Sir, you have led over 100,000 men to join Jiangdong. Quan Yi, myself and the others from Jiangdong are trapped here too with you. Our families are still in Jiangdong. Even if Sun Chen doesn't want to save us, do you think our Emperor and his relatives will abandon us? There were times in the past when our enemy unexpectedly suffered a plague.

Wen Qin became angry when Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi repeatedly urged Zhuge Dan to follow their plan. Zhuge Dan also became increasingly frustrated with Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi and wanted to execute them. The two of them feared for their lives and realised that Zhuge Dan was destined to fail, so in December 257 or January 258, they escaped from Shouchun and surrendered to Sima Zhao.(Áè≠„ÄÅÂΩùÂõ∫Âã∏‰πãÔºåÊ¨ΩÊÄíÔºåËÄåË™ïÊ¨≤ÊÆ∫Áè≠„ÄÇ‰∫å‰∫∫ÊáºÔºå‰∏îÁü•Ë™ï‰πãÂøÖÊïó‰πüÔºåÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúàÔºå‰πÉÁõ∏ÊîúËÄåÈôç„ÄÇ) Han Jin Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28.(Âüé‰∏≠È£üËΩâÂ∞ëÔºåÂ§ñÊïë‰∏çËá≥ÔºåË°ÜÁÑ°ÊâÄÊÅÉ„ÄÇÂ∞áËªçËî£Áè≠„ÄÅÁÑ¶ÂΩùÔºåÁöÜË™ïÁà™ÁâôË®à‰∫ãËÄÖ‰πüÔºåÊ£ÑË™ïÔºåË∏∞ÂüéËá™Ê≠∏Â§ßÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Sima Zhao later used a ploy to persuade Quan Yi () and Quan Duan () to surrender. The Quans fell for the ruse and led a few thousand men with them out of Shouchun to defect to Sima Zhao's side. Their defection caused much fear and panic among Zhuge Dan's forces.(Â§ßÂ∞áËªç‰πÉ‰ΩøÂèçÈñìÔºå‰ª•Â•áËÆäË™™ÂÖ®ÊáåÁ≠âÔºåÊáåÁ≠âÁéáË°ÜÊï∏ÂçÉ‰∫∫ÈñãÈñÄ‰æÜÂá∫„ÄÇÂüé‰∏≠ÈúáÊáºÔºå‰∏çÁü•ÊâÄÁÇ∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. ===Attempting to break the siege=== In February or March 258, Wen Qin told Zhuge Dan, \\"Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi left because we didn't follow their idea to attack the enemy.

Their efforts proved futile because the Wei forces, due to having constructed walls and other defensive structures earlier, were in a more advantageous position over them. The Wei soldiers rained boulders and flaming arrows on Zhuge Dan's forces; thousands were wounded or killed, and the ground was soaked with blood. Unable to break the siege, Zhuge Dan and his forces retreated back to Shouchun, which had run out of food supplies by then. Thousands of Zhuge Dan's men came out of the city and surrendered to Sima Zhao.(Âúç‰∏äË´∏ËªçÔºåËá®È´ò‰ª•ÁôºÁü≥ËªäÁÅ´ÁÆ≠ÈÄÜÁáíÁ†¥ÂÖ∂ÊîªÂÖ∑ÔºåÂº©Áü¢ÂèäÁü≥Èõ®‰∏ãÔºåÊ≠ªÂÇ∑ËÄÖËîΩÂú∞ÔºåË°ÄÊµÅÁõàÂ£ç„ÄÇÂæ©ÈÇÑÂÖ•ÂüéÔºåÂüéÂÖßÈ£üËΩâÁ´≠ÔºåÈôçÂá∫ËÄÖÊï∏Ëê¨Âè£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. ===Downfall and death=== Earlier on, Wen Qin wanted Zhuge Dan to reduce food rations and send all his men to break the siege, while he and the troops from Eastern Wu would remain behind to guard Shouchun. Zhuge Dan strongly disapproved and quarrelled with Wen Qin over this. Although they initially cooperated, they became more suspicious and distrustful of each other as the situation in Shouchun became more desperate. Zhuge Dan eventually had Wen Qin executed.(Ê¨ΩÊ¨≤Áõ°Âá∫ÂåóÊñπ‰∫∫ÔºåÁúÅÈ£üÔºåËàáÂê¥‰∫∫Â†ÖÂÆàÔºåË™ï‰∏çËÅΩÔºåÁî±ÊòØÁà≠ÊÅ®„ÄÇÊ¨ΩÁ¥†ËàáË™ïÊúâÈöôÔºåÂæí‰ª•Ë®àÂêàÔºå‰∫ãÊÄ•ÊÑàÁõ∏Áñë„ÄÇÊ¨ΩË¶ãË™ïË®à‰∫ãÔºåË™ïÈÅÇÊÆ∫Ê¨Ω„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Upon learning of their father's death at Zhuge Dan's hands, Wen Qin's sons Wen Yang and Wen Hu () attempted to flee from Shouchun. After failing to persuade their men to join them, they escaped on their own and surrendered to Sima Zhao. When an officer advised Sima Zhao to execute them, Sima Zhao said, \\"Wen Qin's crimes don't warrant death. Although his sons should be executed, they have surrendered to us. Besides, as the city has yet to be recaptured, executing them will only harden the rebels' resolve.\\" He pardoned Wen Yang and Wen Hu, and ordered a few hundred riders to escort them on a tour around Shouchun and announce to the rebels in the city: \\"See? Wen Qin's sons have been spared. What's there to be afraid of?\\" Sima Zhao later appointed Wen Yang and Wen Hu as military officers and enfeoffed them as secondary marquises.(Ê¨ΩÂ≠êÈ¥¶ÂèäËôéÂ∞áÂÖµÂú®Â∞èÂüé‰∏≠ÔºåËÅûÊ¨ΩÊ≠ªÔºåÂãíÂÖµÈ¶≥Ëµ¥‰πãÔºåË°Ü‰∏çÁÇ∫Áî®„ÄÇÈ¥¶„ÄÅËôéÂñÆËµ∞ÔºåË∏∞ÂüéÂá∫ÔºåËá™Ê≠∏Â§ßÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇËªçÂêèË´ãË™Ö‰πãÔºåÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç‰ª§Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ¨Ω‰πãÁΩ™‰∏çÂÆπË™ÖÔºåÂÖ∂Â≠êÂõ∫ÊáâÁï∂ÊàÆÔºåÁÑ∂È¥¶„ÄÅËôé‰ª•Á™ÆÊ≠∏ÂëΩÔºå‰∏îÂüéÊú™ÊãîÔºåÊÆ∫‰πãÊòØÂ†ÖÂÖ∂ÂøÉ‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉËµ¶È¥¶„ÄÅËôéÔºå‰ΩøÂ∞áÂÖµÊï∏ÁôæÈ®éÈ¶≥Â∑°ÂüéÔºåÂëºË™ûÂüéÂÖß‰∫ëÔºö„ÄåÊñáÊ¨Ω‰πãÂ≠êÁå∂‰∏çË¶ãÊÆ∫ÔºåÂÖ∂È§ò‰ΩïÊáºÔºü„ÄçË°®È¥¶„ÄÅËôéÁÇ∫Â∞áËªçÔºåÂêÑË≥úÁàµÈóúÂÖß‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. By then, most of Zhuge Dan's men had lost their will to fight after being trapped in the city for months without food. Zhuge Dan, Tang Zi and the remaining officers in Shouchun were also at their wits' end. Sima Zhao came to Shouchun and personally directed his forces to press on the siege and call for battle. The defenders did not respond. Zhuge Dan then attempted to break out of the siege with a few of his subordinates. Hu Fen (), a military officer under Sima Zhao, led his men to attack Zhuge Dan and killed him. Zhuge Dan's decapitated head was put on display and his family members were executed. Zhuge Dan had recruited a few hundred mercenaries as bodyguards. After his death, they were rounded up and each was offered the chance to surrender and be spared, but none accepted and all were executed. The loyalty of these bodyguards towards Zhuge Dan was comparable to the loyalty of the 500 retainers towards Tian Heng (). Yu Quan (), a Wu officer, said, \\"I have received orders from my lord to lead troops to help others. I failed in my mission and can't do anything to defeat the enemy. I won't stand for this.\\" He then removed his body armour and charged towards the enemy and was killed.(ÂüéÂÖßÂñú‰∏îÊìæÔºåÂèàÊó•È£¢Âõ∞ÔºåË™ï„ÄÅÂí®Á≠âÊô∫ÂäõÁ™Æ„ÄÇÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç‰πÉËá™Ëá®ÂúçÔºåÂõõÈù£ÈÄ≤ÂÖµÔºåÂêåÊôÇÈºìË≠üÁôªÂüéÔºåÂüéÂÖßÁÑ°Êï¢ÂãïËÄÖ„ÄÇË™ïÁ™òÊÄ•ÔºåÂñÆ‰πòÈ¶¨ÔºåÂ∞áÂÖ∂È∫æ‰∏ãÁ™ÅÂ∞èÂüéÈñÄÂá∫„ÄÇÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂè∏È¶¨ËÉ°Â•ÆÈÉ®ÂÖµÈÄÜÊìäÔºåÊñ¨Ë™ïÔºåÂÇ≥È¶ñÔºåÂ§∑‰∏âÊóè„ÄÇË™ïÈ∫æ‰∏ãÊï∏Áôæ‰∫∫ÔºåÂùê‰∏çÈôçË¶ãÊñ¨ÔºåÁöÜÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁÇ∫Ë´∏ËëõÂÖ¨Ê≠ªÔºå‰∏çÊÅ®„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ∂Âæó‰∫∫ÂøÉÂ¶ÇÊ≠§„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28.(Âπ≤ÂØ∂ÊôâÁ¥ÄÊõ∞ÔºöÊï∏Áôæ‰∫∫Êã±ÊâãÁÇ∫ÂàóÔºåÊØèÊñ¨‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÔºåËºôÈôç‰πãÔºåÁ´ü‰∏çËÆäÔºåËá≥Áõ°ÔºåÊôÇ‰∫∫ÊØî‰πãÁî∞Ê©´„ÄÇÂê≥Â∞á‰∫éË©ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§ß‰∏àÂ§´ÂèóÂëΩÂÖ∂‰∏ªÔºå‰ª•ÂÖµÊïë‰∫∫ÔºåÊó£‰∏çËÉΩÂÖãÔºåÂèàÊùüÊâãÊñºÊïµÔºåÂêæÂºóÂèñ‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂÖçÂÜëÂÜíÈô£ËÄåÊ≠ª„ÄÇ) Jin Ji annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28.

Zhuge Dan's son, Zhuge Jing, was sent as a hostage to Eastern Wu in 257 in return for support from Wu forces for his father's rebellion. He remained in Wu and served as Minister of War (). In 280, after the Jin dynasty conquered Wu, Zhuge Jing went into hiding in the home of his sister (the one who married Sima Zhou). The Jin emperor Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) considered Zhuge Jing his relative (Sima Zhou was an uncle of Emperor Wu) and knew that Zhuge Jing was hiding in his sister's home, so he paid them a visit. When Zhuge Jing heard that the emperor had come to visit him, he hid in the latrine and refused to come out. The emperor insisted on seeing him and said, \\"Today, we finally meet each other again.\\" Zhuge Jing replied tearfully, \\"I regret not being able to cover my body in paint and remove the skin from my face before I meet Your Majesty again!\\" Emperor Wu appointed him as a Palace Attendant (), but he refused to accept, returned to his hometown and lived the rest of his life as a commoner.(Ë´∏ËëõÊÅ¢ÔºåÂ≠óÈÅìÊòéÔºåÁêÖÈÇ™ÈôΩÈÉΩ‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÁ•ñË™ïÔºåÈ≠èÂè∏Á©∫ÔºåÁÇ∫ÊñáÂ∏ùÊâÄË™Ö„ÄÇÁà∂ÈùöÔºåÂ•îÂê≥ÔºåÁÇ∫Â§ßÂè∏È¶¨„ÄÇÂê≥Âπ≥ÔºåÈÄÉÁ´Ñ‰∏çÂá∫„ÄÇÊ≠¶Â∏ùËàáÈùöÊúâËàäÔºåÈùöÂßäÂèàÁÇ∫ÁêÖÈÇ™ÁéãÂ¶ÉÔºåÂ∏ùÁü•ÈùöÂú®ÂßäÈñìÔºåÂõ†Â∞±Ë¶ãÁÑâ„ÄÇÈùöÈÄÉÊñºÂªÅÔºåÂ∏ùÂèàÈÄºË¶ã‰πãÔºåË¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏çË¨Ç‰ªäÊó•Âæ©ÂæóÁõ∏Ë¶ã„ÄÇ„ÄçÈùöÊµÅÊ∂ïÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏çËÉΩÊºÜË∫´ÁöÆÈù¢ÔºåÂæ©ÁùπËÅñÈ°èÔºÅ„ÄçË©î‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰æç‰∏≠ÔºåÂõ∫Ëæ≠‰∏çÊãúÔºåÊ≠∏ÊñºÈÑâÈáåÔºåÁµÇË∫´‰∏çÂêëÊúùÂª∑ËÄåÂùê„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 77.

In its first 70 years, following the Meiji Restoration, factory production in Japan was all but non-existent, but by the first years of the Sh≈çwa era, Japan was at a level comparable to many industrialized European countries. Industry in Japan grew both qualitatively and quantitatively. In 1920, the textile industry was the most important and Japan was known mainly as a manufacturer of wool and silk products, fabrics, fans, toys and similar goods. By 1939, however, industrial production in the areas of metallurgy and chemical products had grown by more than 100%. Industrial output grew significantly during the period 1929-1942, while the total value of heavy industry in Japan, valued at approximately US$700 million in 1931, had risen to US$3.7 billion by 1940. Taking the effects of inflation into consideration, this growth indicates a rise in profits of 400% in heavy industry between 1937 and 1940. At the same time as the extraordinary growth of heavy industry, and a 26% decline in consumption articles during the period 1937-1940, the textile industry maintained its principal place as the primary occupation for Japanese workers. At its relative height during this period, textile production employed approximately one million workers, or roughly 1/3 of the industrial workforce. The rapid growth of pre-war and wartime Japanese industry is reminiscent of the Industrial Revolution in 18th century England. The growth of profits during both periods was astonishing, in terms of both percentages and totals. These developments would never have arisen, however, without an abundant source of low priced and docile manpower and convenient access to raw materials, the latter--though vital--were (and still are) exceedingly rare in Japan. Access to both were important factors in Japan's rapid industrial development. The average Japanese industrial worker worked long hours for a low salary. Before 1940, more than 90% of workers received less than US$7 per week. In later years, average pay rose by 50%, but the cost of living--the articles and services for which one needs salary--rose as well. In peacetime, the Japanese work week averaged 56 hours, compared with 35 hours in the United States and 39 hours in France. Furthermore, the war effort exposed a marked scarcity of specialized workers. One final important element of Japanese industry was small-scale, subsistence industry. Prior to 1941, most of the middle class was employed in handcrafts in cottage industries and small workshops, which normally employed fewer than five workers. Women often worked in this type of industry, and large-scale industry often obtained materials from the small-scale outfits, particularly rayon and cotton. ==Industrial production statistics== {| border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" |Production ¬•M |1919 |1925 |1981 |- |Wood |760,5 |718,4 |459,9 |- |Silk |43,2 |62,0 |53,8 |- |Hemp |16,4 |24,6 |14,9 |- |Mixed silk & cotton |404,9 |242,8 |1,153,5 |- |Silk fabrics |45,5 |29,8 |1,153,5 |- |Cotton fabric |790,0 |703,0 |1,153,5 |- |Hemp fabrics |12,9 |28,4 |1,153,5 |- |Wool fabrics |121,9 |185,0 |1,153,5 |- |Paper, Japan Type |79,6 |53,0 |132,2 |- |Paper, European type |116,6 |119,7 |132,2 |- |Matches: |39,7 | |17,0 |- |Porcelain & ceramics |29,3 |78,2 |65,3 |- |Handcrafts (exports) |31,6 |29,0 |15,1 |- |Camphor, raw and oil |1,7 | |4,6 |- |Lacquer articles |24,1 |30,9 |26,6 |- |Straw articles |18,6 |12,4 | |- |Brushes |11,2 | |5,4 |- |Vegetable oils |61,8 |45,4 |31,9 |} In 1921 there were 87,398 factories with more than five workers; 71,321 used machines, the rest were hand manufacturing. In 1926, there were 51,906 factories with 1,875,000 employees growing in productivity with reduced employees due to mechanisation. The zone extended from the interior sea (Japanese Mediterranean sea) to the Kanto Plain, being the industrial heart of Japan. From Nagasaki and Hiroshima to Tokyo was 600 miles with a series of industrial cities: the region of Osaka-Kobe-Kioto, the axis Tokyo-Yokohama, Nagoya and Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Shimonoseki and Moji in North Ky≈´sh≈´. The Osaka-Kobe-Kioto region makes traditional products, iron and steel, and others. The axis Tokyo-Yokohama manufactured machinery, electrical devices, printing, iron and steel works, and others various factories. Nagoya center poses hilatures and fiber factories and porcelain; the North Ky≈´sh≈´ centers produced high ovens, iron and steel works, iron laminations, shipyards, cement and crystal factories, coal coke processors etc. Additional to these centers were others in Kamaishi (North Honsh≈´) for making iron bars, and Muroran (Hokkaido) similarly. The iron & steel industry was unique in that it produced twice more converter steel than bars of high ovens because of more use of scrap iron and old iron imported from overseas. Other important centers were Heijo (Chosen) for Iron and Steel works, in Karafuto for Cellulose (paper raw material) manufacturing; Kwantung, for Iron & Steel Works (Anshan factory), in Formosa (Camphor and sugar cane processing) and South Mandate for Sugar cane processing. The fishing industry (the most extensive in coastal areas in all the Japanese empire), employed 1,500,000 persons (including 500,000 women and children). The \\"cultivated pearl\\" industry was centred in Toba (Shima area, in Ago Bay) where the Mikimoto Zaibatsu Clan held a monopoly. For military industry, see the additional information. In 1927 and 1937, industrial production remained at ¬•16,412,000,000, which represented three times the value of farming. The textile industry fell from 41.4% in 1926 to 23.8% in 1936; metallurgical industries 6.4% in 1926 to 20.5% in 1936, and the chemical industry 18.6% in 1937 and machinery and industrial equipment growing to 14.5% in the same year.

Differently oriented crystallites in a polycrystalline material A grain boundary is the interface between two grains, or crystallites, in a polycrystalline material. Grain boundaries are 2D defects in the crystal structure, and tend to decrease the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material. Most grain boundaries are preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of creep. On the other hand, grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve mechanical strength, as described by the Hall‚ÄìPetch relationship. The study of grain boundaries and their effects on the mechanical, electrical and other properties of materials forms an important topic in materials science. == High and low angle boundaries == It is convenient to categorize grain boundaries according to the extent of misorientation between the two grains. Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGB) or subgrain boundaries are those with a misorientation less than about 15 degrees.Physical Foundations of Materials Science; Gottstein, G√ºnter; 2014, Generally speaking they are composed of an array of dislocations and their properties and structure are a function of the misorientation. In contrast the properties of high-angle grain boundaries, whose misorientation is greater than about 15 degrees (the transition angle varies from 10‚Äì15 degrees depending on the material), are normally found to be independent of the misorientation. However, there are 'special boundaries' at particular orientations whose interfacial energies are markedly lower than those of general high-angle grain boundaries. Schematic representations of a tilt boundary (top) and a twist boundary between two idealised grains. The simplest boundary is that of a tilt boundary where the rotation axis is parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from a single, contiguous crystallite or grain which is gradually bent by some external force. The energy associated with the elastic bending of the lattice can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of dislocations ‚Äì a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different orientations. An alternative is a twist boundary where the misorientation occurs around an axis that is perpendicular to the boundary plane. This type of boundary incorporates two sets of screw dislocations. If the Burgers vectors of the dislocations are orthogonal, then the dislocations do not strongly interact and form a square network. In other cases, the dislocations may interact to form a more complex hexagonal structure. These concepts of tilt and twist boundaries represent somewhat idealized cases. The majority of boundaries are of a mixed type, containing dislocations of different types and Burgers vectors, in order to create the best fit between the neighboring grains. If the dislocations in the boundary remain isolated and distinct, the boundary can be considered to be low-angle. If deformation continues, the density of dislocations will increase and so reduce the spacing between neighboring dislocations. Eventually, the cores of the dislocations will begin to overlap and the ordered nature of the boundary will begin to break down. At this point the boundary can be considered to be high-angle and the original grain to have separated into two entirely separate grains. In comparison to low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle boundaries are considerably more disordered, with large areas of poor fit and a comparatively open structure. Indeed, they were originally thought to be some form of amorphous or even liquid layer between the grains. However, this model could not explain the observed strength of grain boundaries and, after the invention of electron microscopy, direct evidence of the grain structure meant the hypothesis had to be discarded. It is now accepted that a boundary consists of structural units which depend on both the misorientation of the two grains and the plane of the interface. The types of structural unit that exist can be related to the concept of the coincidence site lattice, in which repeated units are formed from points where the two misoriented lattices happen to coincide. In coincident site lattice (CSL) theory, the degree of fit (Œ£) between the structures of the two grains is described by the reciprocal of the ratio of coincidence sites to the total number of sites. In this framework, it is possible to draw the lattice for the 2 grains and count the number of atoms that are shared (coincidence sites), and the total number of atoms on the boundary (total number of site). For example, when Œ£=3 there will be one atom of each three that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary with high Œ£ might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low Œ£. Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by dislocations, are Œ£1. Some other low-Œ£ boundaries have special properties, especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of coincident sites. Examples include coherent twin boundaries (e.g., Œ£3) and high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., Œ£7). Deviations from the ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the inclusion of dislocations at the boundary. == Describing a boundary == A boundary can be described by the orientation of the boundary to the two grains and the 3-D rotation required to bring the grains into coincidence. Thus a boundary has 5 macroscopic degrees of freedom. However, it is common to describe a boundary only as the orientation relationship of the neighbouring grains. Generally, the convenience of ignoring the boundary plane orientation, which is very difficult to determine, outweighs the reduced information. The relative orientation of the two grains is described using the rotation matrix: The characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations in a completely randomly oriented set of grains for cubic symmetry materials. : R = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix} Using this system the rotation angle Œ∏ is: : 2\\\\cos\\\\;\\\\theta\\\\;+1 = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! while the direction [uvw] of the rotation axis is: : [(a_{32}-a_{23}),(a_{13}-a_{31}),(a_{21}-a_{12})] \\\\,\\\\\\\\! The nature of the crystallography involved limits the misorientation of the boundary. A completely random polycrystal, with no texture, thus has a characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations (see figure). However, such cases are rare and most materials will deviate from this ideal to a greater or lesser degree. == Boundary energy == The energy of a tilt boundary and the energy per dislocation as the misorientation of the boundary increases The energy of a low-angle boundary is dependent on the degree of misorientation between the neighbouring grains up to the transition to high-angle status. In the case of simple tilt boundaries the energy of a boundary made up of dislocations with Burgers vector b and spacing h is predicted by the Read‚ÄìShockley equation: : \\\\gamma _s = \\\\gamma _0 \\\\theta (A - \\\\ln \\\\theta) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where: : \\\\theta = b / h \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : \\\\gamma_0 = Gb/4\\\\pi(1- u) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! : A = 1 + \\\\ln(b/2\\\\pi r_0) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! with G is the shear modulus, u is Poisson's ratio, and r_0 is the radius of the dislocation core. It can be seen that as the energy of the boundary increases the energy per dislocation decreases. Thus there is a driving force to produce fewer, more misoriented boundaries (i.e., grain growth). The situation in high-angle boundaries is more complex. Although theory predicts that the energy will be a minimum for ideal CSL configurations, with deviations requiring dislocations and other energetic features, empirical measurements suggest the relationship is more complicated. Some predicted troughs in energy are found as expected while others missing or substantially reduced. Surveys of the available experimental data have indicated that simple relationships such as low \\\\Sigma are misleading: > It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be > enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the > variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure > and the details of the bonding at the interface. == Excess volume == The excess volume is another important property in the characterization of grain boundaries. Excess volume was first proposed by Bishop in a private communication to Aaron and Bolling in 1972. It describes how much expansion is induced by the presence of a GB and is thought that the degree and susceptibility of segregation is directly proportional to this. Despite the name the excess volume is actually a change in length, this is because of the 2D nature of GBs the length of interest is the expansion normal to the GB plane. The excess volume (\\\\delta V) is defined in the following way, : \\\\delta V = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial V} {\\\\partial A} \\\\right)_{T,p,n_i}, at constant temperature T, pressure p and number of atoms n_i. Although a rough linear relationship between GB energy and excess volume exists the orientations where this relationship is violated can behave significantly differently affecting mechanical and electrical properties. Experimental techniques have been developed which directly probe the excess volume and have been used to explore the properties of nanocrystalline copper and nickel. Theoretical methods have also been developed and are in good agreement. A key observation is that there is an inverse relationship with the bulk modulus meaning that the larger the bulk modulus (the ability to compress a material) the smaller the excess volume will be, there is also direct relationship with the lattice constant, this provides methodology to find materials with a desirable excess volume for a specific application. == Boundary migration == The movement of grain boundaries (HAGB) has implications for recrystallization and grain growth while subgrain boundary (LAGB) movement strongly influences recovery and the nucleation of recrystallization. A boundary moves due to a pressure acting on it. It is generally assumed that the velocity is directly proportional to the pressure with the constant of proportionality being the mobility of the boundary. The mobility is strongly temperature dependent and often follows an Arrhenius type relationship: : M = M_0 \\\\exp \\\\left (- \\\\frac{Q}{RT} \\\\right ) \\\\,\\\\\\\\! The apparent activation energy (Q) may be related to the thermally activated atomistic processes that occur during boundary movement. However, there are several proposed mechanisms where the mobility will depend on the driving pressure and the assumed proportionality may break down. It is generally accepted that the mobility of low-angle boundaries is much lower than that of high-angle boundaries. The following observations appear to hold true over a range of conditions: * The mobility of low-angle boundaries is proportional to the pressure acting on it. * The rate controlling process is that of bulk diffusion * The boundary mobility increases with misorientation. Since low-angle boundaries are composed of arrays of dislocations and their movement may be related to dislocation theory. The most likely mechanism, given the experimental data, is that of dislocation climb, rate limited by the diffusion of solute in the bulk. The movement of high-angle boundaries occurs by the transfer of atoms between the neighbouring grains. The ease with which this can occur will depend on the structure of the boundary, itself dependent on the crystallography of the grains involved, impurity atoms and the temperature. It is possible that some form of diffusionless mechanism (akin to diffusionless phase transformations such as martensite) may operate in certain conditions. Some defects in the boundary, such as steps and ledges, may also offer alternative mechanisms for atomic transfer. Grain growth can be inhibited by second phase particles via Zener pinning. Since a high-angle boundary is imperfectly packed compared to the normal lattice it has some amount of free space or free volume where solute atoms may possess a lower energy. As a result, a boundary may be associated with a solute atmosphere that will retard its movement. Only at higher velocities will the boundary be able to break free of its atmosphere and resume normal motion. Both low- and high-angle boundaries are retarded by the presence of particles via the so-called Zener pinning effect. This effect is often exploited in commercial alloys to minimise or prevent recrystallization or grain growth during heat-treatment. == Complexion == Grain boundaries are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form a thin layer with a different composition from the bulk. For example, a thin layer of silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure.Sutton AP, Balluffi RW. (1995) Interfaces in crystalline materials. Oxford: Oxford Scientific Publications. This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates.Hart EW (1972). The nature and behavior of grain boundaries. New York: Plenum; p. 155. Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2‚Äì20 √Ö). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 √Ö thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero. Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, nanolayer (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.Ma S. et al. Scripta Mater (2012) n66, p203. == Effect to the electronic structure == Grain boundaries can cause failure mechanically by embrittlement through solute segregation (see Hinkley Point A nuclear power station) but they also can detrimentally affect the electronic properties. In metal oxides it has been shown theoretically that at the grain boundaries in Al2O3 and MgO the insulating properties can be significantly diminished.Guhl, H., Lee, H.-S., Tangney, P., Foulkes, W. M. C., Heuer, A. H., Nakagawa, T., ‚Ä¶ Finnis, M. W. (2015). Structural and electronic properties of Œ£7 grain boundaries in Œ±-Al2O3. Acta Materialia, 99, 16‚Äì28. Using density functional theory computer simulations of grain boundaries have shown that the band gap can be reduced by up to 45%.Bean, J.

Scientific Reports, 7(January), 45594. In the case of metals grain boundaries increase the resistivity as the size of the grains relative to the mean free path of other scatters becomes significant.Mayadas, A. F., & Shatzkes, M. (1970). Electrical-resistivity model for polycrystalline films: The case of arbitrary reflection at external surfaces. Physical Review B, 1(4), 1382‚Äì1389. == Defect concentration near grain boundaries == It is known that most materials are polycrystalline and contain grain boundaries and that grain boundaries can act as sinks and transport pathways for point defects. However experimentally and theoretically determining what effect point defects have on a system is difficult. Interesting examples of the complications of how point defect behave has been manifested in the temperature dependence of the Seebeck effect. In addition the dielectric and piezoelectric response can be altered by the distribution of point defects near grain boundaries. Mechanical properties can also be significantly influenced with properties such as the bulk modulus and damping being influenced by changes to the distribution of point defects within a material. It has also been found that the Kondo effect within graphene can be tuned due to a complex relationship between grain boundaries and point defects. Recent theoretical calculations have revealed that point defects can be extremely favourable near certain grain boundary types and significantly affect the electronic properties with a reduction in the band gap. ==See also == * Segregation in materials == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Metallurgy Category:Crystallography Category:Materials science ","title":"Grain boundary"},{"id":"1996540","text":"Howard F.

It was released on December 15, 2006. ==Plot== Taciturn, partially deaf Hanna (Polley) is a Yugoslavian native working in a factory in Northern Ireland. She is forced to use annual leave by her boss, who tells her that her co-workers have been offended by her work diligence. After overhearing a conversation about a need for a nurse, she takes on a job as private nurse for burn victim Josef (Robbins). He is bedridden on an offshore oil rig after a fire on the rig, and has severe burns and is temporarily blinded. The rig is not operational awaiting an investigation, and few people remain on board. Hanna talks very little, and especially does not want to talk about herself. Despite his pain, Josef is constantly making jokes, some of them humorous sexual advances. Hanna's care for him includes holding the urinal and washing his entire body. As they get closer, they start sharing their experiences. Unbeknownst to him, she listens over and over again to a message on his cell phone from a mysterious woman who was in love with him. Hanna learns from a colleague that Josef was injured while trying to save a man who committed suicide by intentionally throwing himself into the oil-rig fire. Some other tragic connection between the two men is implied. He tells about a near-drowning experience because he cannot swim. Eventually Josef confides to Hanna his greatest secret guilt, and she tells him about her previous life in the former Yugoslavia. She describes in detail the horrors she endured during the Balkan Wars (Yugoslav Wars), including being kidnapped and repeatedly raped. She shares experiences of the other women, including one that was forced to shoot her own daughter, and the slow and agonizing death of her best friend. She tells of her own repeated torture and lets him feel the scars on her body from the wounds inflicted on her. Josef is not getting better, and at Hanna's initiative he is air-lifted off the oil rig to be taken to a hospital. When the helicopter lands, Josef wants Hanna to accompany him, but she walks away without a word. However, she leaves behind a backpack (apparently intentionally), and it contains enough information to give Josef a chance to find her. After he recovers, Josef travels to Denmark to visit a counselor that Hanna had seen after fleeing the war, seeking to learn more about her. He then tracks her down at the factory in Northern Ireland where she works. They talk, and at first she keeps her distance, saying she couldn't be with him because she thinks one day she could drown them both in her sorrow. When he tells her that he will \\"learn to swim,\\" she reciprocates the love. Later, Hanna is shown in a home with the voice of a young girl explaining that Hanna now has two sons, whom the narrator refers to as her brothers, indicating that the woman Hanna described as having been forced to kill her own child was, in fact, herself. The voice of her daughter ends the film with the hope that Hanna will one day be able to live completely in the \\"now\\" and no longer be haunted by the past. ==Cast== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

He was born in 1837 probably in Quebec City and died in Westmount, Quebec, in 1919. He served in the cabinets of Sir John Sparrow David Thompson and Sir Mackenzie Bowell as Minister of Agriculture and as President of the Privy Council under Sir Charles Tupper. He also served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec after being elected in Montmorency in 1874 as a Conservative. He was knighted in the 1913 New Year Honours. After his death in 1919, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. ==Early life== There is an element of mystery around Auguste's birth. Historians generally agree he was born on October 4th, 1837 but no substantial birth certificate has ever been found. Though, in the 1901 census lists his birth as October 4th. Angers studied at the S√©minaire de Nicolet between 1849 and 1856. He eventually went on to study law at the Universit√© de Laval. He then went on to join a prospering law firm in Quebec City. After building a strong background for politics, he went on to easily won a provincial by-election in Montmorency for the Conservatives. ==Delve into Politics== After being re-elected to his seat in Montmorency, in 1875 he was appointed as Government leader in the Legislative Assembly and Attorney General in 1876. Since the Premier of Quebec at the time Charles Boucher de Boucherville was sitting in the Legislative Council, the appointed Upper Chamber of the Province, Angers acted as the voice to the government in the Legislative Assembly helping pass key legislation. He continued to act in this role for multiple years. In 1879, Angers lost his seat by 14 votes in a general election. Afterwards, he ran for Federal Parliament in a by-election winning the Montmorency seat. Shortly afterwards he was appointed as puisne judge of the Superior Court for Montmagny district. He settled down in a town on the St. Lawrence River. In 1887 Angers accepted an appointment making him Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec. In December 1892 he accepted an appointment as a Senator and was given an agriculture porfolio in John Sparrow David Thompson's Ministry. He continued in this capacity until 1895 where he resigned and briefly took up the post of President of the Privy Council before retiring from politics. ==Later Life== Angers moved to Montreal where he returned to practicing law and in 1911 he was appointed as legal counsel to the Montreal Harbour Commission. == Archives == There are Auguste-R√©al Angers fonds at Library and Archives Canada and Biblioth√®que et Archives nationales du Qu√©bec. == References * Category:1837 births Category:1919 deaths Category:Lawyers in Quebec Category:Canadian senators from Quebec Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) MPs Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867‚Äì1942) senators Category:Canadian Knights Bachelor Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Conservative Party of Quebec MNAs Category:Lieutenant Governors of Quebec Category:Universit√© Laval alumni Category:Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery burials ","title":"Auguste-R√©al Angers"},{"id":"1996574","text":"The trolley takes shoppers on a short ride from The Grove to Farmer's Market The Grove is a retail and entertainment complex in Los Angeles, located on parts of the historic Farmers Market. ==History== The complex fills space previously occupied by an orchard and nursery, which were the last remains of a dairy farm owned by A. F. Gilmore in the latter part of the 19th century. The developers began demolition of an antiques alley and other older buildings on Third Street behind CBS Television City, and broke ground for the new mall in 1999. There was some controversy over potentially increasing traffic in a busy Los Angeles neighborhood that already offered several other shopping venues, including the Beverly Center. The Grove opened in 2002. The Warner Bros. tabloid television news program Extra was also taped in the complex from 2010-2013, usually on the mall's lawn area. Since November 2015, it has also served as a venue for the finales of Dancing with the Stars. The history behind the development of the A. F. Gilmore property that eventually became The Grove was not without controversy. In 1984, A. F. Gilmore and neighboring CBS Television City hired Olympia & York California Equities Corp. to look into the possibility of creating a major business and entertainment complex that would have been twice as large as Universal City but would have required the demolition of all existing structures at both Farmers Market and CBS in the process. Alternate Link via ProQuest. That plan was not well received by the City of Los Angeles or by its neighbors and the plan was later shelved. Two years later A. F. Gilmore and CBS hired Urban Investment & Development Co. of Chicago to create another development plan. In 1989, A. F. Gilmore announced that it was going to build a US$300 million mall adjacent to the existing Farmers Market and that the new project would be managed by JMB/Urban Development of Chicago. The proposed mall was going to be anchored by May Company California, Nordstrom, and J. W. Robinson's along with over 100 other stores. Later, the project was scaled down to 2 anchors. During the next decade, A. F. Gilmore announced in 1998 a further scaled down plan with Caruso Affiliated as the new development partner for a new proposal that eventually became The Grove at Farmers Market, a $100-million project on . Nordstrom signed on in 2001 to build a store. By early 2001, toy retailer FAO Schwarz also sign on for along with Banana Republic, Gap, Barnes & Noble, J. Crew, Maggiano's Italian restaurant and a 14-screen movie complex to be the initial stores in the new project. After many delays, the retail center finally opened in March 2002. FAO Schwarz was one of the first retail casualties at the Grove after FAO Schwarz's parent company had to declare bankruptcy in 2004. The Grove was able to replace the store with American Girl Place, which opened in April 2006. Abercrombie & Fitch closed their flagship store in February 2015, and was replaced seven months later with a Nike flagship store that opened in September 2015. Also in 2013, Banana Republic moved into a new space at the mall, and the old space was occupied by a Topshop/Topman store. In the original plan, the 14-screen movie complex was going to be built by Pacific Theatres to be its first Arc Light multiplex. At the last minute, Pacific Theatres pulled out of the project and opted to build the multiplex in Hollywood, ArcLight Hollywood, instead. Caruso decided to fund the construction of the multiplex out of the company's own pockets. After 10 months of successful operations, Caruso decided to sell the multiplex outright. Pacific gave the highest bid at US$30 million. In May 2020, The Grove was damaged after some of its stores were looted following the killing of George Floyd. ==Design== The outdoor marketplace is located in Los Angeles' Fairfax District. Initial architectural design was performed in-house by David Williams of Caruso Affiliated Holdings and by KMD Architects of San Francisco. Caruso Affiliated claims to have modeled its architectural designs on indigenous Los Angeles buildings, influenced by classic historic districts, with shopping alleys, broad plazas, and intimate courtyards. The design features a series of Art Deco-style false fronts, with boxy interiors similar to those found in other contemporary stores. ==Attractions== The Grove features a large central park with an animated fountain designed by WET. Its music-fountain show plays every hour, though the feature has a non-musical program in between shows. The water's choreography is reminiscent of the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas--also designed by WET--but on a much smaller scale. The property also has a statue, The Spirit of Los Angeles. Live shows are often performed there‚Äîon the grassy area by the fountains. An internal transit system uses electric-powered trolley cars to link The Grove and the adjacent Farmers Market. ==Shops and restaurants== The Grove is anchored by Nordstrom and has flagship stores such as Barnes & Noble and Apple. Abercrombie & Fitch previously had its West Coast flagship at the mall, which closed in 2015, and has since been replaced by Nike. Other stores in the center include Michael Kors, Gap, J.Crew & Crew Cuts, Crate & Barrel, Nike, MAC Cosmetics, Coach, Brandy Melville, Charlotte Tilbury, Frame, Janie and Jack, Lululemon, Madewell, Paige, Pottery Barn Kids, MRay-Ban, Sandro, Athletic Propulsion Labs, See;s Candies, Sephora, Splendid, Alo Yoga, Athleta, Swaroski, TopShop/TopMan and American Girl Place. The Grove's many restaurants include chains like Maggiano's Little Italy and The Cheesecake Factory as well as smaller, local restaurants like Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill, 189 by Dominique Ansel, The Whisper Lounge, and La Piazza. The Original Farmers Market, located adjacent to The Grove and owned by the A. F. Gilmore Company, features numerous non-chain restaurants that have existed there for sometimes decades. The main entertainment venue is a 14-screen movie theater complex owned by Pacific Theatres. == Christmas tree == In mid-November, the Grove Christmas Tree is displayed, and lit every evening, beginning with the annual tree lighting ceremony. The tree remains lit every evening for the remainder of the Christmas season. Usually up to or more, it is one of the tallest Christmas trees in the Los Angeles area. In more recent years, The Grove also transforms \\"into a winter wonderland\\" where artificial snow falls every evening at 7 & 8 pm, through Christmas Eve.

Brown (born July 22, 1951) is the 10th president of Boston University. He was formerly the provost of MIT. ==Biography== Brown is a chemical engineer by training. A native of San Antonio, Texas, he received his B.S. and M.A. in chemical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1979. In 1979, Brown joined the faculty of MIT as an assistant professor. He worked at MIT for 25 years before moving across the Charles River to become the president of Boston University. During his tenure at MIT, he served as Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering, co-director of the MIT Supercomputer Facility, Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering, and Dean of Engineering. In 1998, he became the provost of MIT. Brown was selected as the 10th president of Boston University in May 2005. He was inaugurated in September 2005, succeeding Aram V. Chobanian, who served as President from October 2003 until June 2005. Brown became an honorary citizen of Singapore in January 2006 for being a key role in creating collaborations between the National University of Singapore, the Nanyang Technological University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and established world-class graduate research and educational programmes to Singapore. In February 2006, President George W. Bush appointed Brown to the President‚Äôs Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a panel established to maintain a steady stream of expert advice from the private sector and the academic community on a wide range of scientific and technical matters. Brown is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a director of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Brown served as a member of the Board of the Aalto University from 2008-2010. He was honored with the National Academy of Engineering Simon Ramo Founders Award in 2014 for his contributions to engineering and society. ==Brown's Presidency== As president of Boston University, Brown led the development of a strategic plan, Choosing to be Great, that outlined commitments that the university must make to be among the best private research universities in the world, and has led the detailed implementation of the plan. In 2015, he released an updated strategic plan, which highlighted some of the successes of the original plan's implementation, including reducing the size of the incoming freshman class, improving the academic credentials of admitted students, and lowering the student-to-faculty ratio, resulting in higher student achievement and improved graduation rates. ===Initiatives & development=== Under Brown's presidency, the university has created the Arvind and Chandan Nandlal Kilachand Honors College, a residential honors college for Boston University undergraduates, which was dedicated in 2011, and the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, established in 2014, which combines traditional international relations with faculty in the humanities and social sciences interested in global students, as well as the traditional area studies centers. In 2013, the University created the Initiative on Cities, with the former Mayor of Boston Thomas Menino as a founding co- director. The IOC focuses on engaging urban leaders, academics, and policy makers to help plan for the development of essential services and sustainable infrastructure necessary for cities to flourish. Following Mayor Menino's death in fall 2014, his legacy was continued through the Annual Menino Survey of Mayors. The progress of Boston University has been acknowledged in many ways, including improved academic rankings and by bond rating improvements. Most notably, in 2012, Boston University was admitted to the Association of American Universities (AAU), the group of premier public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. New facilities built during Brown's presidency include: *Yawkey Center for Student Services, which combines undergraduate student services with a modern dining hall *New Balance Field, the second athletic field for the university, built above a parking structure *33 Agganis Way, a two-building 960-bed undergraduate residence *Medical Student Residence on the Medical Campus *Sumner Redstone Building for the School of Law (accompanied by complete renovation of the Law Tower, completed in 2015) *The Engineering Product Innovation Center, a 15,000-square-foot space for engineering product development and collaboration used by students in the College of Engineering *The Alan and Sherry Leventhal Center, the visitor center for the Charles River Campus, which houses the undergraduate admissions reception center *The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory (NEIDL), the somewhat controversial laboratory supported by the NIH, which houses a Biosafety Containment 4 (BSL-4) laboratory, the highest containment level for performing research on the most lethal infectious diseases. *The Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences & Engineering, a 180,000-square-foot research facility ===Campaign for BU=== Many of these initiatives have been driven by the University's first-ever comprehensive fundraising campaign, which was launched in 2012 with the goal of raising $1 billion by the end of 2017. The goal of the campaign was raised to $1.5 billion in September 2015. ==Personal== Brown lives in Brookline with his wife, Dr. Beverly Brown, who works at Boston University as director of development, industry at the School of Public Health at Boston University. They have two grown sons. ==Awards and honors== * 4x Outstanding Faculty Award, Department of Chemical Engineering, M.I.T.

It was originally intended for use with its Quadro FX GPU, although a Quadro class GPU is no longer a requirement, as it now also supports GeForce cards. Designed to produce film-quality images, Gelato uses a shading language very similar to RenderMan's. Gelato was first released in April 2004. NVIDIA stated in May 2008 that it will no longer be developing or supporting the Gelato software products . With the release of Gelato 2.0, and in a push to popularize GPU accelerated rendering (as opposed to the traditional CPU rendering), Nvidia released a free version of Gelato for PCs. Some of the more advanced features on this version were locked out, such as those used for production rendering. This was done to encourage more professional users to purchase the full product. However, on 23 May 2008, Nvidia released Gelato Pro as a free download without any additional license. It does not come with support from Nvidia, but there are user forums. ==History== The original renderer was priced at several thousand United States dollars (USD) per node. In order to boost the adoption of the product by a wider user base, in late 2006, Nvidia decided to split the product up into two versions, a free version called Gelato and a professional version called Gelato Pro, which sold for US$1,500 per render node. Gelato Pro is now also offered as a free download.

Calder held a Bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Connecticut and a master's degree in information systems from George Washington University. He was a United States Navy radio operator. From 1966, he was as communications officer in the CIA Directorate of Administration (DA) Office of Communications (OC). It was in this role that he found himself trapped for several days inside the CIA's base in Benghazi, Libya, during riots in the wake of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. His chief at the time was Thomas Twetten, who rose to become deputy director for operations (DDO). Calder served in numerous roles within the CIA, including Directorate of Operations (DO) case officer, deputy chief of the DO Near East Division (NE) for Arab operations, and chief of DO Operations and Resource Management Staff. In late 1995, then-CIA Director John M. Deutch made Calder an offer to run the DA, of whose inefficiencies he had been sharply critical, with a free hand. Against nearly universal resistance among his own directorate's leadership, Calder instituted activity-based costing and a working-capital fund, returning the majority of his directorate's budget back to the operational units and requiring his directorate to offer its services on a reimbursable basis. The net result was a freeing up of significant resources for use in the Agency's main operational and analytic missions. He retired from the CIA in 2001. That year he was named president of Abraxas Corporation by company founder and former CIA director Richard Helms and served until his retirement in 2008.Washington Post, 16 November 14A Bold Upstart With CIA Roots\\" Los Angeles Times, September 17, 2006.

In terms of water treatment, including water purification and sewage treatment, backwashing refers to pumping water backwards through the filters media, sometimes including intermittent use of compressed air during the process. Backwashing is a form of preventive maintenance so that the filter media can be reused. In water treatment plants, backwashing can be an automated process that is run by local programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The backwash cycle is triggered after a set time interval, when the filter effluent turbidity is greater than a treatment guideline or when the differential pressure (head loss) across the filter exceeds a set value. Water treatment filters that can be backwashed include rapid sand filters, water softening systems, pressure filters and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Diatomaceous earth filters are backwashed according to the proprietary arrangement of pumps, valves and filters associated with the filtration system.Diatomaceous Earth Pool Filters Accessed 2012-06-20. Slow sand filters and self-cleaning screen filters employ mechanisms other than backwashing to remove trapped particles. To keep water treatment filters functional, they have to be cleaned periodically to remove particulates. Ineffective backwashing is one of the main reasons that water treatment filters fail. ==Procedure== Backwashing demo on a test column Backwashing of granular media filters involves several steps. First, the filter is taken off line and the water is drained to a level that is above the surface of the filter bed. Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the filter bed to expand breaking up the compacted filter bed and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the filter bed continuing the filter bed expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the filter surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the filter bed settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to the filter surface until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.Kawamura, Susumu. (2000). Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities. 2nd Edition. New York:Wiley. pp. 74-5, 104. Edzwald, James K., ed. (2011). Water Quality and Treatment. 6th Edition. New York:McGraw-Hill. Crittenden, John C., et al., eds. (2005). Water Treatment: Principles and Design. 2nd Edition. Hoboken, NJ:Wiley. Baruth, Edward E., ed. (1990). Water Treatment Plant Design. 4th Edition. New York:McGraw-Hill. Williams, Robert B. and Culp, Gordon L., eds. (1986). Handbook of Public Water Systems. New York:Van Nostrand Reinhold. Some water treatment filters use surface wash systems that break up the heavily clogged, granular media surface layer. Surface wash systems are buried in the top of the filter media or are suspended above the filter media surface. John R. Baylis developed a fixed grid system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion.Baylis, John R. (1959). \\"Review of Filter Bed Design and Methods of Washing.\\" Journal AWWA. 51:11 1433-54. Rotating arms use jets of water to break up the clogged filter surface and to rotate a movable arm through the filter material. A surface wash step in a backwash cycle usually takes place at the beginning of the filter bed cleaning process. ==Treatment== Spent backwash water is either discharged without treatment to a sanitary sewer system or is treated and recycled within the plant. Historically, backwash water was discharged directly to surface water supplies; however, direct discharge is now highly regulated through NPDES discharge permits and is often discouraged. Used backwash water contains high concentrations of particulate material. Typical treatment processes include coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation. High molecular weight synthetic organic polymers are sometimes added to facilitate the formation of settleable floc. Failure of a backwash treatment process and reintroduction of the resulting poor quality water into the main water purification plant flow stream can cause overall process upsets and result in the production of poor quality treated drinking water. ==Recycling== As a water conservation measure, many water purification plants recycle filter backwash water and other product streams from sludge treatment processes back to the beginning of the plant. On June 8, 2001, the USEPA released a final regulation governing acceptable practices for recycling backwash water.National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Filter Backwash Recycling Rule Federal Register. 66:111 June 8, 2001. The purpose of the regulation was to improve the control of microbial contaminants such as Cryptosporidium by reducing the potential for recycled product streams to upset the removal efficiency of the main treatment processes. The regulation requires that spent filter backwash water be recycled to the front of the treatment plant so that all available particle removal treatment processes can be employed to remove the microbial and particulate material from the backwash water. ==References== ==External links== *National Environmental Services Center - Filter Backwashing Accessed 2012-06-20. *Filter Backwash - Seymour Capilano Water Plant video.

It was based on the play of the same name by Jerry Sterner.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/25/nyregion/theater-other-people-s- money-revived-in-westport.html?searchResultPosition=7 The film adaptation was directed by award winner Norman Jewison, and written by Alvin Sargent. ==Plot== Lawrence \\"Larry the Liquidator\\" Garfield (Danny DeVito) is a successful corporate raider who has become rich buying up companies and selling off their assets. With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called \\"Carmen\\", Garfield has identified New England Wire & Cable Company as his next target. The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew \\"Jorgy\\" Jorgenson (Gregory Peck) and is the primary employer in its small Rhode Island town in New England. The company is doing okay and stock is rising. Garfield decides to take over the company. After Jorgy learns that he has filed a Schedule 13D report, and after stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate (Penelope Ann Miller), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover. Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire & Cable. Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature. The takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire & Cable Company family. Kate's mother Bea (Piper Laurie) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in greenmail to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, \\"I don't take money from widows or orphans.\\" Trusted company president Bill Coles (Dean Jones), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout. Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the margin of victory. Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting. Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money. The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal. In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last buggy whip manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete. Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise. At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket. When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company. The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get. Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate. Just then, Kate calls. She's been having discussions with a Japanese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire & Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making automobile airbags, something which will make the company profitable again on a new expanding industrial product. An excited Garfield invites her to dinner to discuss it. Kate tells him lunch, ‚Äústrictly business, you know where.‚Äù Garfield blushes and smiles at this. ==Cast== *Danny DeVito as Lawrence (\\"Larry the Liquidator\\") Garfield *Gregory Peck as Andrew (\\"Jorgy\\") Jorgenson *Penelope Ann Miller as Kate Sullivan *Piper Laurie as Bea Sullivan *Dean Jones as Bill Coles *R.

Other scenes were shot in the (also defunct) Gilbert and Bennett mill in Georgetown, Connecticut. ==Reception== The film received mixed to negative reviews, with a 31% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, but said 'I didn't like the very last scene of ‚ÄúOther People‚Äôs Money.‚Äù It felt tacked on, manufactured, concocted out of a Hollywood studio's knee-jerk need to provide a smileyface ending that was not in the spirit of the film'. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said of Sargent's adaptation, 'culminates in a speechy but effective debate about the merits of old-fashioned business versus the corporate takeover,' but still felt that the film was 'too genial to be hard-hitting.' ==References* * * Category:1991 films Category:1991 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American business films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Trading films Category:Films directed by Norman Jewison Category:American films based on plays Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films set in Rhode Island Category:Films shot in Connecticut Category:Corporate raiders Category:Wall Street films Category:Films scored by David Newman Category:Films with screenplays by Alvin Sargent ","title":"Other People's Money"},{"id":"1996628","text":"This is a list of notable events in country music that took place in the year 2005. ==Events== *April 30 ‚Äì Billboard magazine renames the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart \\"Hot Country Songs.\\" The chart's renaming is part of a major redesign of the 110-year-old magazine. *May 25 ‚Äì Oklahoma-born Carrie Underwood becomes the fourth-season winner of \\"American Idol.\\" Although her first single, \\"Inside Your Heaven,\\" tops the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the 22-year-old Underwood's influences and music are predominantly country.

A year and a half later, in late , the company introduced the Buenos Aires‚ÄìRio de Janeiro‚ÄìNatal‚ÄìDakar‚ÄìLisbon‚ÄìParis‚ÄìFrankfurt route, using 48-seater DC-6 equipment, linking Argentina with Germany for the first time since 1933. By , the carrier's route network was long. Upon taking delivery of the first three Comet 4s, which also became the first jetliners in the airline's fleet, these brand new aircraft were deployed on the Buenos Aires‚ÄìLondon, Buenos Aires‚ÄìNew York City, and Buenos Aires‚ÄìSantiago de Chile routes. , the airline's top five international routes in terms of available seat kilometre (ASK) were Buenos Aires-Ezeiza‚ÄìMadrid-Barajas, Buenos Aires- Ezeiza‚ÄìMiami, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza‚ÄìBarcelona, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza‚ÄìRome- Fiumicino and Buenos Aires-Ezeiza‚ÄìSydney; European routes account for about 41% of total ASK. In , the airline was granted permission to operate services to Atlanta, Detroit, Guangzhou, Las Vegas and Tel Aviv, yet it was announced it will not fly to these destinations with its own aircraft in the near future. In , the carrier announced the discontinuance of services to Sydney starting in . Aerol√≠neas had previously served Sydney via Auckland until the city was removed from the airline international network in . After leaving the Buenos Aires‚ÄìNew York JFK market unserved since 2008, Aerol√≠neas Argentinas resumed these flights in . , the airline top five domestic airports by available seats are Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, Ingeniero Aeron√°utico Ambrosio L.V.

It was directed by Luis Puenzo and co-written with A√≠da Bortnik, based on the 1985 novel The Old Gringo by Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes.Old Gringo at the Internet Movie Database. The film was screened out of competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== American schoolteacher Harriet Winslow goes to Mexico to work as a governess for the Miranda family, and becomes caught up in the Mexican revolution. Mexicans transporting her from Chihuahua, secretly soldiers of Pancho Villa's army, use her luggage to smuggle weapons to the servants at the Miranda hacienda. The servants in turn aid the attacking revolutionary army of General Tomas Arroyo. During the attack, a sardonic \\"Old Gringo\\", American author Ambrose Bierce, joins the fighting on the side of the revolutionaries; he operates a railway switch that sends a railroad flatcar laden with explosives to its target. After the Miranda hacienda is taken, Winslow becomes romantically attracted alternately to Bierce and then Arroyo. Bierce has come to Mexico to die in anonymity; he feels that his fifty years as a writer have won him praise only for his style, not for the truth that he's tried to tell. Arroyo, by contrast, has returned to the hacienda where he was born. His father was a Miranda who had raped his peasant mother. Later in his youth, Arroyo murdered his father. While his army enjoys previously unknown luxuries on the war-damaged palatial estate, Arroyo becomes obsessed with his past. Transfixed by childhood memories of his family buried there, he fails to move his army when ordered by Villa. To bring Arroyo to his senses and avert a mutiny of his officers, Bierce burns papers that the illiterate Arroyo considers sacred‚Äîpapers that supposedly entitle the peasants to the hacienda land. Arroyo responds by shooting Bierce in the back, killing him. Bierce dies in Winslow's arms. Winslow goes to the U.S. embassy in Mexico to claim Bierce's body and bring it back to the United States. She claims that he was her long-lost father. This puts Villa in a predicament because a U.S. citizen was murdered by one of his generals. Wishing to avoid American meddling in the revolution, he has Winslow sign a statement that her father had joined the revolution and was executed for disobeying orders, as was General Arroyo who had shot him, and that she witnessed both executions. She signs the statement, is provided with the coffin bearing Bierce's body, and witnesses the execution of Arroyo. ==Cast== ==Reception== Before its release in theatres, the film was booed at the Cannes film festival. Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times said: \\"There is a potentially wonderful story at the heart of Old Gringo, but the movie never finds it--the screenplay blasts away in every direction except the bulls-eye. ... It's heavy on disconnected episodes, light on drama and storytelling.\\" Janet Maslin in the New York Times said: \\"... the film's version of romance is no less aimless than its battle scenes. ... The sly, cantankerous character of Ambrose Bierce, an aged cynic surprised and delighted to find himself vibrantly alive and at last in control of his own destiny, reveals in Mr. Peck something vigorous and new.\\"Maslin, \\" 'Old Gringo' Fuentes Tale, Stars, Peck, Fonda and Smits.\\" New York Times, Oct. 6, 1989. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 12 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. It was a box-office failure. Jane Fonda received a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress for her performance in the film, where she ended up losing to Heather Locklear for The Return of Swamp Thing. ==References* Category:1989 films Category:1980s adventure films Category:1980s romance films Category:American films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films based on Mexican novels Category:Films directed by Luis Puenzo Category:Films scored by Lee Holdridge Category:Mexican Revolution films ","title":"Old Gringo"},{"id":"1996646","text":"Mass appeal as an phenomenon of mass psychology may refer to: *Argumentum ad populum, or \\"appeal to the masses\\" *having a generally appealing or popular quality, see **Mass culture **Crowd manipulation **Influencer **Mass media ***Influence of mass media **Fast food, etc. ==As a proper name== * Mass Appeal (play), 1980 play by Bill C.

It is an adaptation of the Electra myth, previously used by the Greek playwrights Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides. The play recounts the story of Orestes and his sister Electra in their quest to avenge the death of their father Agamemnon, king of Argos, by killing their mother Clytemnestra and her husband Aegisthus, who had deposed and killed him. Sartre incorporates an existentialist theme into the play, having Electra and Orestes engaged in a battle with Zeus and his Furies, who are the gods of Argos and the centerpiece for self-abnegating religious rituals. This results in fear and a lack of autonomy for Zeus's worshippers, who live in constant shame of their humanity. ==Synopsis== ===Act 1=== Orestes first arrives as a traveler with his tutor/slave, and does not seek involvement. Orestes has been traveling in a quest to find himself. He enters the story more as an adolescent with a girlish face, one who does not know his path or responsibility. He enters the city and introduces himself as Philebus (\\"lover of youth\\"), to disguise his true identity. Zeus has followed Orestes on his journey, and finally approaches him in Argos, introducing himself as Demetrios (\\"devoted to Demeter\\", a goddess who was in fact Zeus' own sister). Orestes has come on the eve of the day of the dead, a day of mourning to commemorate the killing of Agamemnon fifteen years prior. No townsperson aside from an aphasic \\"idiot boy\\" will speak to Orestes or his tutor because they are strangers and not mourning, remorseful or dressed in all black. Orestes meets his sister, Electra, and sees the terrible state that both she and the city are in. Electra has been treated as a servant girl since her mother and Aegisthus killed her father. She longs to exact her revenge and refuses to mourn for the sins and death of Agamemnon or of the townspeople. ===Act 2=== Orestes goes to the ceremony of the dead, where the angry souls are released by Aegisthus for one day where they are allowed out to roam the town and torment those who have wronged them. The townspeople have to welcome the souls by setting a place at their tables and welcoming them into their beds. The townspeople have seen their purpose in life as constantly mourning and being remorseful of their \\"sins\\". Electra, late to the ceremony, dances on top the cave in a white gown to symbolize her youth and innocence. She dances and yells to announce her freedom and denounce the expectation to mourn for deaths not her own. The townspeople begin to believe and think of freedom until Zeus sends a contrary sign to deter them, and to deter Orestes from confronting the present King. Orestes and Electra unite and eventually resolve to kill Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. Zeus visits Aegisthus to tell him of Orestes's plan and convince him to stop it. Here Zeus reveals two secrets of the gods: 1) people are free and 2) once they are free and realize it, the gods cannot touch them. It then becomes a matter between men. The ceremony of the dead and its fable has enabled Aegisthus to keep control and order over the town, instilled fear among them. Aegisthus refuses to fight back when Orestes and Electra confront him. Orestes kills Aegisthus and then he alone goes to Clytemnestra's bed chamber and kills her as well. ===Act 3=== Orestes and Electra flee to the temple of Apollo to escape men and the flies. At the temple, the furies wait for Orestes and Electra to leave the sanctuary so the furies can attack and torture them. Electra fears her brother and begins to try to avoid her responsibility for the murders. She attempts to evade guilt and remorse by claiming she had only dreamt of murder for 15 years, as a form of release, while Orestes is the actual murderer. Orestes tries to keep her from listening to the Furies - which are convincing her to repent and accept punishment. Zeus attempts to convince Orestes to atone for his crime, but Orestes says he cannot atone for something that is not a crime. Zeus tells Electra he has come to save them and will gladly forgive and give the throne to the siblings, if they repent. Orestes refuses the throne and belongings of the man he killed. Orestes feels he has saved the city by removing the veil from their eyes and exposing them to freedom. Zeus says the townspeople hate him and are waiting to kill him; he is alone. The scene at the temple of Apollo represent a decision between God's law and self-law (autonomy). Zeus points out that Orestes is foreign even to himself. Sartre demonstrates Orestes' authenticity by stating that, since his past does not determine his future, Orestes has no set identity: he freely creates his identity anew at every moment. He can never know who he is with certainty because his identity changes from moment to moment. Orestes still refuses to repudiate his actions. In response, Zeus tells Orestes of how he himself has ordered the universe and nature based on Goodness, and by rejecting this Goodness, Orestes has rejected the universe itself. Orestes accepts his exile from nature and from the rest of humanity. Orestes argues Zeus is not the king of man and blundered when he gave them freedom - at that point they ceased to be under god's power. Orestes announces he will free the townspeople from their remorse and take on all their guilt and \\"sin\\" (author makes reference to Jesus Christ). Here Orestes somewhat illustrates Nietzsche's overman by showing the townspeople his power to overcome pity. Electra chases after Zeus and promises him her repentance. When Electra repudiates her crime, Orestes says that she is bringing guilt on herself. Guilt results from the failure to accept responsibility for one's actions as a product of one's freedom. To repudiate one's actions is to agree that it was wrong to take those actions in the first place. In doing this, Electra repudiates her ability to freely choose her own values (to Sartre, an act of bad faith). Instead, she accepts the values that Zeus imposes on her. In repudiating the murders of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, Electra allows Zeus to determine her past for her. She surrenders her freedom by letting her past take on a meaning that she did not give to it by herself, and as a result she becomes bound to a meaning that did not come from her. Electra can choose, like Orestes, to see the murders as right and therefore to reject feelings of guilt. Instead, she allows Zeus to tell her that the murders were wrong and to implicate her in a crime. The Furies decide to leave her alone in order to wait for Orestes to weaken so they can attack him. The Tutor enters but the Furies will not let him through. Orestes orders him to open the door so that he may address his people. Orestes informs them he has taken their crimes upon himself and that they must learn to build a new life for themselves without remorse. He wishes to be a king without a kingdom, and promises to leave, taking their sins, their dead, and their flies with him. Telling the story of the pied piper, Orestes walks off into the light as the Furies chase after him. ==Characters== Zeus (Greek) / Jupiter (Roman) ‚Äì a major antagonist in the play, Zeus is introduced in the exposition as \\"god of flies and death\\", although he is traditionally associated with sky, lightning, thunder, law, order, and justice. Orestes (Philebus) ‚Äì the play's major protagonist, he is the brother of Electra and the son of Agamemnon. Electra ‚Äì the sister of Orestes and the daughter of Agamemnon. Agamemnon ‚Äì the former king of Argos and the father of Orestes and Electra, Agamemnon was murdered by Aegisthus prior to the story's onset. Orestes' desire to avenge his father's death is a major plot device in the play. Clytemnestra ‚Äì the wife of Aegisthus and the mother of Orestes and Electra. Aegisthus ‚Äì the husband of Clytemnestra. Furies ‚Äì also known as the Erinyes or \\"infernal goddesses\\", the Furies serve as Zeus' enforcers in Argos and punish those who swear false oaths. ==Background== In 1941, Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attended performances of a production of The Suppliant Maidens, in which Olga Kosakiewicz had a part. :\\"It was during this production of The Suppliant Maidens that Sartre conceived the idea of writing a play himself. Both Olgas [i.e. Olga Kosakiewicz and another woman named Olga] had parts in it . . . . During rehearsals they asked [the play's producer-director Jean-Louis Barrault] how to go about getting a really first- rate part. 'The best way,' he replied, 'would be to get someone to write a play for you.' And Sartre thought: 'Why shouldn't I be the one?' He had written and produced a play in the Stalag, called Bariona: ostensibly the theme of this 'mystery play' was the birth of Christ, but in fact the drama centered on the Roman occupation of Palestine, and his fellow prisoners were quick to take the allusion. What they applauded on Christmas Eve was Resistance propaganda. The real function of the theater, Sartre thought at the time, is to appeal to those who share a common predicament with the playwright. This 'common predicament' was one that faced Frenchmen everywhere, assailed daily as they were by German and Vichy propaganda exhorting them to repent and submit; the theater might provide a medium through which to remind them of rebellion and freedom. He began to cast around for a plot that would be at once technically unobjectionable and transparent and its implications.\\"Simone de Beauvoir, The Prime of Life (first English edition 1962), pp. 385-86.Annie Cohen-Solal, Jean-Paul Sartre: A Life (1987), p. 183. Years later, Sartre stated: \\"The real drama, the drama I should have liked to write, was that of the terrorist who, by ambushing Germans, becomes the instrument for the execution of fifty hostages.\\"Cohen-Solal (1987), p. 182, citing Sartre on Theater (1976), p. 188. Noted Sartre biographer Annie Cohen- Solal views this statement as an allusion to a series of events that occurred in occupied Paris in 1941: a German officer was killed at the M√©tro Barb√®s and in retaliation the German military forces executed eight prisoners in September and then 98 prisoners in October.Cohen-Solal (1987), p. 182. However, the German censors would have banned such a play, so Sartre was forced to look for other subjects. He settled on the idea of using the story of the Atridae as a vehicle.de Beauvoir (1962), p. 392. De Beauvoir says that the first act was inspired by the town of Emborio, \\"the village on Santorin which had presented so sinister at atmosphere to us when we first reached it [during a holiday] -- all those blank, shuttered houses under the blazing noonday sun.\\" de Beauvoir (1962), pp. 246, 394. She also says that she, after reading a book about the Etruscans, informed Sartre about the Etruscans' funeral ceremonies, and he found inspiration in this for the second act.de Beauvoir (1962), p. 402. ==Sartre's philosophy== One scholar has explained the relationship between The Flies and Sartre's philosophy thus: :\\"The play explores the key existentialist themes of freedom and responsibility through the radical conversion of Philebus the peace loving intellectual into Orestes the warrior. A person may not be prepared for present crises by his past experiences, but it is nonetheless bad faith for him to declare, 'I was not meant for this' or 'This should not be happening to me.' Orestes resists bad faith and achieves authenticity by rising to the demands of his circumstances and fully realizing his being-in-situation.\\" Gary Cox, Sartre and Fiction (2009), p. 131. Sartre's idea of freedom specifically requires that the being- for-itself be neither a being-for-others nor a being-in-itself. A being-for- others occurs when human beings accept morals thrust onto them by others. A being-in-itself occurs when human beings do not separate themselves from objects of nature. Zeus represents both a moral norm, the Good, and Nature. Freedom is not the ability to physically do whatever one wants. It is the ability to mentally interpret one's own life for oneself‚Äîto define oneself and create one's own values. Even the slave can interpret his or her life in different ways, and in this sense the slave is free. The Flies also shows the effect of Nietzsche on Sartre. Orestes represents the idea of the overman, as described in works such as Thus Spoke Zarathustra; the ability to free one's mind from dogma and the impressions of others, and instead think on a higher level. Like Zarathustra, Orestes feels he must \\"go down\\" to the people and open their eyes (though unlike Zarathustra, Orestes does it out of compassion). When debating Zeus, Orestes also talks about being \\"beyond\\" the moral yoke others allow to be placed on them - an idea explicitly discussed in Beyond Good and Evil, and implicitly described in other works by Nietzsche. Orestes is not bound by the false dichotomy of \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" and instead accepts what has been done, choosing to focus on the present and the future. Sartre continued a twentieth-century tradition of an incestuous flirtation between √âlectre and Oreste in Les Mouches. This flirtation may be understood as a display of Sartrean facticity, perhaps inspired by the incestuous siblings of Andre Gide‚Äôs ≈ídipe, and philosophically motivated by Gide and Sartre‚Äôs shared antipathy to Freud‚Äôs repression theory. ==Production history== The Flies was first produced in Paris in the summer of 1943. The production ran at the Th√©√¢tre de la Cit√©.Cohen-Solal (1987), p. 184. Sartre had to get German censors to approve the play, because Paris was occupied by the German army. A sculptor was employed to create \\"great blocks of stone\\", as well as settings, masks, and statues; large numbers of extras were also used.de Beauvoir (1962), p. 426. During one of the rehearsals, a young man came up to Sartre and introduced himself; it turned out to be Albert Camus.de Beauvoir (1962), p. 427. The production was poorly attended and got a lukewarm reception from critics. Simone de Beauvoir's assessment of the play's effectiveness and reception was as follows: \\"It was impossible to mistake the play's implications; the word Liberty, dropped from Orestes' mouth, burst on us like a bomb. The German critic of Pariser Zeitung saw this very clearly, and said so, though at the same time taking the credit for giving the play a favorable notice. Michel Leiris praised The Flies in a clandestine edition of Les Lettres francaises, and emphasized its political significance. Most reviewers pretended not to have noticed any such allusion; they pitched into the play viciously, but, so they alleged, on purely literary grounds . . . \\" After a first smaller US production at Vassar College early in April 1947, the play received its New York City debut at the President Theatre on April 16, 1947. It was directed by the head of the Dramatic Workshop, German expatriate stage director Erwin Piscator. The New York Times critic Lester Bernstein reacted favorably to the play and its production: == Compared to the Oresteia == The Flies is also a modern take on Aeschylus‚Äô trilogy, the Oresteia. While Sartre keeps many aspects of the original story by Aeschylus, he adjusts the play to fit his views, with strong themes of freedom from psychological slavery. He focuses most on the second play in the Oresteia trilogy, only referencing the first play, Agamemnon, with the mention of Agamemnon‚Äôs death by Clytemnestra and Aegisthus. The plot of the third play, The Eumenides is also excluded because in that play, the Council of Elders absolves Orestes of his sins, but since Sartre depicts Orestes as remorseless, he cannot include that storyline in his play without having to change his storyline. Unlike in Aeschylus‚Äô The Libation Bearers, where revenge is one of the main themes throughout the play, Sartre‚Äôs Orestes does not kill Aegisthus and Clytemnestra for vengeance or because it was his destiny, instead it is for the sake of the people of Argos, so that they may be freed from their enslavement. Sartre wants to stress the fact that Orestes comes to that decision by himself, without the aid or direction of any outside forces, which contrasts with the Orestes in The Libation Bearers, who relies heavily on the direction of the gods. Sartre even diminishes the character of Clytemnestra so that there is much less emphasis on matricide than there is in the version by Aeschylus. While Electra is guilt-stricken after the death of Clytemnestra, Orestes feels no remorse for killing his mother, so his relationship with her is not very important. Sartre‚Äôs representation of the Furies differs from that of Aeschylus in that, instead of attempting to avenge the crimes committed, they try to evoke guilt from those who committed them. Sartre does this to reiterate the importance of amenability; he wants to prove that remorse should only be felt if one believes the act committed is wrong. By acting in what he believes to be a righteous way and killing the king and queen, Orestes takes responsibility for his actions without feeling any remorse for them. == Adaptations == * La Tragedie d'Oreste et Electre: Album by British band The Cranes_(band). == References == ==Sources== * TeacherWeb.

He served more than six years at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York before being transferred to the Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City, from which he was granted conditional release on January 17, 2014.Inmate Information ¬ª NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov. Retrieved January 25, 2013. Separately, Tyco filed suit against Kozlowski and prevailed, with the court finding that the $500 million in compensation and benefits he received during his time of disloyalty, between 1997 and 2002, were forfeit back to the company under New York's \\"faithless servant\\" doctrine. ==Early life== Kozlowski was born in Newark, New Jersey. His mother, Agnes (n√©e Kozell), worked for the Newark Police Department and as a school crossing guard, and his father, Leo Kelly Kozlowski, worked for the Public Service Transport. His parents were second-generation Polish-Americans. Kozlowski attended Seton Hall University, a Catholic university. ==Tyco International== Kozlowski joined Tyco in 1975, becoming CEO in 1992. With Kozlowski at the helm, Tyco massively expanded during the late 1990s. The company consistently beat Wall Street's expectations and through a series of strategic mergers and acquisitions, ushered in a new era of mega-conglomerates. Kozlowski left Tyco in 2002, amid a controversy in regard to his compensation package. ===Scandal, trial, and conviction=== Kozlowski has been tried twice. The first attempt was a ruled mistrial when one of the jurors was threatened by the public after being reported to have made an OK sign towards Kozlowski's lawyers. Kozlowski testified on his own behalf during the second trial, stating that his pay package was \\"confusing\\" and \\"almost embarrassingly big,\\" but that he never committed a crime as the company's top executive. Along with former Tyco chief financial officer Mark Swartz, Kozlowski was convicted on June 17, 2005 of crimes related to his receipt of $81 million in purportedly unauthorized bonuses, the purchase of art for $14.725 million and the payment by Tyco of a $20 million investment banking fee to Frank Walsh, a former Tyco director. On September 19, 2005 he was sentenced by Judge Michael Obus of the Manhattan Supreme Court to serve from eight years and four months to twenty-five years in prison for his role in the scandal. In addition, Kozlowski and Swartz were ordered to pay a total of $134 million in restitution. Koslowski was further fined $70 million, while Swartz was fined $35 million. Both were convicted on 22 counts of grand larceny, falsifying business records, securities fraud and conspiracy.Associated Press, Kozlowski sentenced in Tyco trial. Denver Post, September 19, 2005. Retrieved October 7, 2016. His aggregate minimum sentence was set at 8 years and 4 months, and his aggregate maximum sentence was 25 years; his conditional release date was set for May 17, 2022, and his maximum expiration date was September 17, 2030. In April 2012, Kozlowski was denied parole. His next parole eligibility date, and his parole hearing merit release appearance, were then set for January 17, 2014. On January 17, 2014, he was granted conditional release from the Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City. ===Commenting on his trial=== Kozlowski, prior to trial, asserted his innocence by stating, \\"I am absolutely not guilty of the charges. There was no criminal intent here. Nothing was hidden. There were no shredded documents. All the information the prosecutors got was directly off the books and records of the company.\\" After his conviction, but before his appeal was complete, he again denied his guilt. \\"I was a guy sitting in a courtroom making $100 million a year [a]nd I think a juror sitting there just would have to say, 'All that money? He must have done something wrong.' I think it's as simple as that.\\" Nevertheless, Kozlowski admitted his culpability for the crimes at his parole hearing. ‚ÄúIt was greed, pure and simple,‚Äù the 67-year-old former executive told a New York State parole panel at a December 3 video conference hearing. ‚ÄúI feel horrible ... I can't say how sorry I am and how deeply I regret my actions.‚Äù https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tyco-kozlowski- release/ex-tyco-ceo-kozlowski-says-he-stole-out-of-pure-greed- idUSBRE9B417820131205 Kozlowski's trial was criticized by civil rights lawyer Dan Ackman, who said: > It's fair to say that Kozlowski and Swartz abused many corporate > prerogatives and that they invented new ones just so they could abuse them. > They acted like pigs, as a lot of CEOs act like pigs. Still, the larceny > charges at the heart of the case did not depend on whether the defendants > took the money‚Äîthey did‚Äîbut whether they were authorized to take it. > Questions of authority are, by nature, legal questions, not questions for > jurors. ===Faithless servant liability=== Tyco filed against Kozlowski, asserting that the $500 million in compensation and benefits he received during his time of disloyalty, between 1997 and 2002, were forfeit under New York's \\"faithless servant\\" doctrine. Southern District of New York Judge Thomas Griesa concluded in 2010 that under the faithless servant doctrine, Kozlowski must forfeit all compensation and benefits he earned during his period of disloyalty. ==Personal life== Kozlowski has been married three times, and has grandchildren.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/business/dealbook/dennis- kozlowskis-path-from-infamy-to-obscurity.html Kozlowski became notorious for his extravagant lifestyle, supported by the booming stock market of the late 1990s and early 2000s; allegedly, he had Tyco pay for his $30 million New York City apartment which included $6,000 shower curtains and $15,000 \\"dog umbrella stands\\". According to Forbes, Kozlowski also purchased several acres in the private gated community, \\"The Sanctuary\\", in Boca Raton, Florida, while he was CEO at Tyco International. He also purchased a multimillion-dollar oceanfront estate on the island of Nantucket. Tyco paid $1 million (half of the $2 million bill) for the 40th birthday party of Kozlowski's second wife, Karen Mayo Kozlowski. The extravagant party, held on the Italian island of Sardinia, featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David urinating Stolichnaya vodka and a private concert by Jimmy Buffett. In a camcorder video, Dennis Kozlowski states that this party will bring out a Tyco core competency ‚Äì the ability to party hard. Subsequently, this shareholder meeting/birthday party became known as the Tyco Roman Orgy. On July 31, 2006, Karen Kozlowski filed for divorce in Palm Beach County, Florida. No specific reasons were cited, but the motion asked the court to equitably distribute the couple's assets and liabilities and asked that gifts Karen received be declared marital property. She also sought a lien on the couple's Boca Raton mansion. The motion also requested alimony. Kozlowski served as Head of the Board at Berwick Academy in South Berwick, Maine for many years, and served on the Middlebury College Board of Trustees in the 1990s. Dennis Kozlowski now lives between NYC, Florida and Nantucket and runs several businesses with his third wife, Kimberly. Dennis is the Chairman of the Board of the Fortune Society and Kimberly is the President of the Women's Prison Association. ==References== ==Further reading== *A Hill and A Michaels, 'Paw taste condemns Kozlowski: Report says Tyco bought $15,000 dog umbrella stand for chief's apartment' (September 18, 2002) Financial Times ==External links== * Video: October 2011 Kozlowsi Applying for Release * Interview with Dennis Kozlowski from prison by writer Peter Hossli * Dennis Kozlowski's Campaign Contributions * The Infamous Party Invitation * Partial transcript of the CBS 60 Minutes interview from cbsnews.com Category:1946 births Category:American chief executives Category:American fraudsters Category:American people convicted of fraud Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:American white- collar criminals Category:Living people Category:People from Boca Raton, Florida Category:Businesspeople from Newark, New Jersey Category:Prisoners and detainees of New York (state) Category:Seton Hall University alumni Category:Tyco International Category:American businesspeople convicted of crimes ","title":"Dennis Kozlowski"},{"id":"1996699","text":"In√©s Gaviria (born March 15, 1979) is a Colombian singer-songwriter based in Miami, Florida.

The series was first broadcast in the U.S. on Turner Network Television (TNT) on six Fridays starting on June 10, 2005. It was also shown in the UK on BBC2 and BBC HD from November 4, 2006, and in Canada on CBC Television. The series also aired in the U.S. on AMC during the summer (June/July) and fall (autumn, September/October) of 2012. The miniseries begins in the 1820s and is told mainly through the third person narration of Jacob Wheeler (Matthew Settle) and Loved By the Buffalo (Joseph M. Marshall III), although episodes outside the direct observation of both protagonists are also shown. The plot follows the story of two families, one white American, one Native American, as their lives become mingled through the momentous events of American expansion. The story intertwines real and fictional characters and events spanning the period of expansion of the United States in the American West, from 1825 to 1890. The show has a large cast, with about 250 speaking parts. The series features well-known performers including Josh Brolin, Gary Busey, Michael Spears, Tonantzin Carmelo, Skeet Ulrich, Garrett Wang, Steve Reevis, Rachael Leigh Cook, Wes Studi, Irene Bedard, Alan Tudyk, Christian Kane, Russell Means, Jay Tavare, Keri Russell, Graham Greene, Sean Astin, Beau Bridges, Judge Reinhold, Zahn McClarnon, Tom Berenger, Gil Birmingham, David Paymer, Raoul Trujillo, Eric Schweig, Lance Henriksen, Simon R. Baker, Tyler Christopher, Tatanka Means, Gordon Tootoosis, Sheila Tousey, and Will Patton. It was filmed in Drumheller, Alberta and Santa Fe, New Mexico. ==Episodes== ===Episode 1: \\"Wheel to the Stars\\" === Growling Bear (Gordon Tootoosis), an elderly Lakota medicine man, has an apocalyptic vision that the buffalo his people rely upon will soon vanish from the prairie and the Lakota will live in square houses. His vision is controversial and his apprentice, Soaring Eagle (Gerald Auger), convinces most of the people to disregard Growling Bear's dark vision. A young boy named White Feather (Chevez Ezaneh) overhears and seeks out the now discredited Growling Bear to learn more about his vision. Before he dies, Growling Bear gives White Feather a necklace symbolizing the Lakota medicine wheel. This necklace is passed on to various characters through the miniseries. Later, during a buffalo jump hunt led by White Feather's older brothers Running Fox (Matthew Strongeagle) and Dog Star (Pony Boy Osuniga), many people from the village are killed during the stampede, but White Feather is miraculously spared when the spirit of deceased Growling Bear appears to protect him. The tribe renames him Loved by the Buffalo and begin to regard him as a holy man healing people by taking their pain upon himself. This causes Soaring Eagle to become jealous and he tries to undermine Loved by the Buffalo (Simon Baker) by blaming him for an outbreak of pox and then leaving him for dead. Growling Bear appears to Loved by the Buffalo again, teaching him a song to cure the outbreak. Loved by the Buffalo's sister, Thunder Heart Woman (Sarah Weston), is married off to a white trapper, Thomas Lebeck (Scott Heindl). Loved by the Buffalo gives Thunder Heart Woman the wooden medicine wheel necklace as a parting gift. Dog Star (Michael Spears) and Running Fox (Zahn McClarnon) marry two sisters and begin families, but Loved by the Buffalo realizes that his destiny lies on a different path. At about the same time, a young wheelwright named Jacob Wheeler (Matthew Settle) is growing discontented with his settled life in the fictional Wheelerton, Virginia, where he and his brothers work as wheelwrights for his grandfather Abraham (Ken Pogue), a veteran of the Battle of Yorktown. When a mountain man named James Fletcher (Will Patton) passes through, he tells Jacob of the wonders of the western frontier and that he will be joining an expedition to the Pacific Ocean led by the famous Jedediah Smith (Josh Brolin) leaving from St. Louis, Jacob decides to leave his family and head west. He convinces his brother Nathan (Alan Tudyk), to come west with him, but another brother, Jethro (Skeet Ulrich), cannot bring himself to leave his home and stays behind. Once the brothers reach St. Louis, Missouri, they find Fletcher, who rebuffs them. Dejected, Nathan goes into a saloon to drink and gamble, winning a deed to a land claim in the Mexican province of Tejas. Nathan tries to convince Jacob to come with him to Tejas, but Jacob has become determined to become a mountain man and travel to the West with Jedediah Smith. The brothers part company and Jacob heads toward the Rocky Mountains. Jacob catches up with Fletcher and trapping party captain Jedediah Smith who once again rebuffs him, but he convinces them to take him in. Jacob stitches Smith's scalp after a bear attack and prefers Smith's company rather than fraternizing with a Mojave tribe they trade with for horses in the Sierra Nevadas. Eventually he becomes a trusted member of the party. Jacob accompanies Smith's party to California Fred, where they are arrested by the Mexican Capitan de Salamanca (Francesco Quinn) for trespassing and held at the San Gabriel Mission. The party is charged with stealing the horses they bought from the Mojave (a brand is shown). The Mexicans fear that if they are freed, the party will show other Americans how to go to California. Smith negotiates their expulsion, promising they would never return to California under pain of death. On the way back, they return to the Mohave camp and are attacked; many are killed including Fletcher, who guards Smith and Jacob's narrow escape through a cave. Loved by the Buffalo undergoes a Sun Dance. Thunder Heart Woman's (Tonantzin Carmelo) trapper husband Lebeck is killed in an attack by the Crow, her infant daughter is captured, and she is sold into slavery. Later, Jacob sees her being auctioned off at a trapper rendezvous and attempts to buy her in order to return Thunder Heart Woman to her people. Trapper Johnny Fox (Gary Busey) rifle duels Jacob for the right to purchase her. Jacob is victorious, shooting then stabbing Fox one-handed after being shot in his left forearm. Thunder Heart Woman gives Jacob the wooden medicine wheel necklace as a token of her gratitude. When they return to the tribe, Jacob marries Thunder Heart Woman and begins to live with her family as part of the Lakota tribe. Running Fox trades for a horsecart, much to the dismay of his brothers, who see white goods as a corruption of Lakota culture. When Loved by the Buffalo sees Jacob repairing the wheel, he is reminded of a vision he had during his Sun Dance in which a wooden wheel smashes a stone wheel. Loved by the Buffalo realizes that the wooden wheel symbolizes the wagon wheels of the whites and that the stone wheel is the medicine wheel of the Lakota culture. Loved by the Buffalo takes Jacob and Thunder Heart Woman to a sacred hilltop where a stone medicine wheel has been erected and tells him about the four great powers that it symbolizes. Loved by the Buffalo leaves the tribe to try to prevent the vision of Growling Bear from coming to pass. ===Episode 2: \\"Manifest Destiny\\" === After living among the Lakota people, Jacob decides to take his wife and daughter Margaret Light Shines east to Wheelerton, Virginia. Jacob's family gives Thunder Heart Woman a much colder reception than her family gave him. After living in Wheelerton for a time, Jacob decides to take his family, now including a young son Abraham High Wolf, back west. This time, Jacob's brother Jethro (Skeet Ulrich) decides to come along. They are also accompanied by Jacob's three young female cousins; Leah Wheeler (Emily Holmes), Rachel Wheeler (Jessica Capshaw), and Naomi Wheeler (Keri Russell). The three girls have been unlucky in love and are lured by the tales of excitement out west. Meanwhile, Thunder Heart Woman's two oldest brothers, Dog Star and Running Fox argue over whether or not to adopt white technology. The disagreement comes to a boil and the two agree to part ways, splitting the tribe. After working their way west for several years, the Wheeler clan arrives at Independence, Missouri. Jacob, now with a second son Jacob Junior High Cloud, wants to go west to California or the Oregon country, but Thunder Heart Woman and some of the others wish to remain in Missouri. Jacob eventually convinces the others to go to California and they join a wagon train led by Stephen Hoxie (Beau Bridges) who is a better salesman than a leader. Among the other settlers is a German immigrant preacher named Hobbes (Derek de Lint), a free black family fleeing racial prejudice, and several former mountain men. The wagon train passage is filled with dangers: Leah Wheeler is thrown from the wagon during the crossing of a river and drowns, and the young son of the black pioneers is killed by stampeding cattle during a thunder storm. But life also continues: Rachel and Naomi take husbands from among the wagon trail guides. Later, while traversing a pass, a wagon breaks free, knocks Rachel down and runs over her leg, causing a severe compound fracture. The leg eventually becomes infected and must be amputated. Preacher Hobbes is the closest thing to a doctor available, but he botches the operation and Rachel dies. Cholera breaks out, killing the wife of the black pioneer. Those exposed, including Jacob, Thunder Heart Woman, the children, and Jethro must stay behind under quarantine while the main body of the wagon train carries on. Naomi and her husband, who have not been exposed, go on with the others. Jethro is afflicted with symptoms of cholera but recovers, and no new outbreaks occur after Jacob orders that all drinking water be boiled. They rush to catch up with the main body, but find it was attacked by Cheyenne warriors, and all except Naomi were killed. Naomi, taken into captivity, is sold to Cheyenne chief Prairie Fire (Jay Tavare), who takes her as his wife. The thought of a forced marriage to an Indian is repulsive to Naomi, who has always considered them as barely human savages. She chants nursery rhymes, which put off his amorous advances. In time, she begins to see Prairie Fire in a different light and she grows to become happy in her new life. She eventually gives birth to a son, whom he names One Horn Bull. Jacob returns to the rest of the wagons, and they are soon attacked. The Indians are fought off, but an arrow is shot through Jacob's upper chest, and he begs to be left behind to recover on his own terms as the trail would kill him faster. After the party leaves, Jacob is rescued by a party led by Running Fox, that stumble across him half-dead. After recovering his strength, Jacob spends several months in the mountains. Haunted by the faces of the children he sent on with his wife and brother, Jacob eventually tries to find them in California. He searches several years for his family but cannot find them, and eventually gives them up for dead. The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War erupts and Jacob joins John C. Fr√©mont's militia to fight the Mexican Army. During a supply stop in one of the settlements, he sees his wife at a distance, but before he can go over to greet her, he sees her and his brother Jethro embrace and kiss. They also have a new child, Cornflower. Dejected that his wife and brother have become romantically involved but not wanting to disrupt their happiness, he decides to leave without making his presence known. Before he goes, he gives the wooden medicine wheel necklace to his young son, who does not realize the man is his father. Meanwhile, Dog Star and Running Fox are still estranged. The other tribes that have been trading with the whites for rifles, particularly the Crow, have grown stronger, and the Lakota are now at a disadvantage. Seeking guidance, Dog Star visits the stone medicine wheel, where he meets Loved by the Buffalo. Loved by the Buffalo tells his brother that his lifetime quest is to preserve the traditional ways. The whites at the forts refuse to trade pistols to the Lakota, instead giving them whiskey, and drunkenness soon becomes a problem. Loved by the Buffalo also appears to his brother Running Fox in a vision. Running Fox and Dog Star eventually reconcile and agree to no longer trade for white goods. Thunder Heart Woman finds the wooden medicine wheel necklace and realizes that her husband is still alive. She feels that it is best not to go after him, but their daughter Margaret Light Shines Wheeler (Sage Galesi) is determined to find him. ===Episode 3: \\"Dreams and Schemes\\" === Jethro and Thunder Heart Woman remain together in California and a daughter, Corn Flower (Chantelle Webster), is born to them. While working at the Wheeler ranch, now dubbed Rancho Paradiso, Jethro encounters a 49er named Martin Jarrett (Sean Astin) who brings him the first news about the California gold rush. Jethro soon follows him to the nearby American River to prospect for gold, although he returns home each night. Jethro dreams of quick riches but all he finds are a few small grains. Undeterred, he begins to spend more and more time looking for gold. Without Jethro's labor, the ranch begins to run into difficulties, with essential repairs being left undone. Jethro also takes to drinking heavily to counter the frigid waters of the river and becomes abusive towards Thunder Heart Woman and the children. After one too many arguments turn violent, Abe High Wolf Wheeler (Tyler Posey) decides to leave. Jethro's cousin, David Wheeler (Balthazar Getty), arrives as a 49er and becomes Jethro's partner in prospecting for gold. Angered by the successes of a group of Chinese immigrant miners, Jethro and David drive them off and steal their claim. After finding a huge nugget of gold, Jethro and David argue over how they will split their new fortune. After Jethro falls asleep, David steals the nugget and heads toward San Francisco. Jethro follows him and the two exchange gun fire. As David tries to escape in a canoe, the two struggle and both are drowned. To support her family, Thunder Heart Woman starts to sell food and supplies to the miners. Meanwhile, Margaret Light Shines Wheeler has taken a job in a guest house in San Francisco, but continues to look for her father. Jacob remained with the army, but became disillusioned at the treatment of Native Americans in Oregon and returned to trapping in the mountains in California. After spotting an army unit sporting a Bear Flag, Margaret inquires if any of them know Jacob Wheeler. A sergeant tells her that Jacob is among them and says he will lead her to him. When the two enter a barn, he tries to rape her. Margaret is saved by Ethan Biggs (Daniel Gillies), a British immigrant photographer. Margaret goes to work for Biggs and the two eventually fall in love and marry. While working in the photo studio, a local wheelwright tells Margaret a trapper in the mountains has fixed a broken wagon wheel for some settlers. Certain that it's her father, Margaret convinces Biggs to join her looking for the trapper's camp. When they find the camp, Jacob at first takes them for thieves and nearly shoots them. Margaret shows him the wooden medicine wheel necklace and he realizes that she is his daughter. Jacob then goes to Rancho Paradiso and is reunited with his family. On the plains, white encroachment has become an undeniable problem for the tribes. Running Fox and Dog Star join several other chiefs‚Äîincluding Conquering Bear (Graham Greene)‚Äîat the signing of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). All three agree that the peace is precarious but decide to give the agreement a chance. A little later, Loved by the Buffalo is visiting Conquering Bear's village. A cow escapes from a passing Mormon wagon train and rampages through the village, causing considerable damage. The villagers try to give the cow back to the settlers, but they become frightened at the sight of the Indians and run away. The tribe decides to keep the cow as compensation for the damage and butcher it. Soldiers soon come, demanding that the cow be returned and the \\"thief\\" be handed over. Conquering Bear tries to explain the situation to the soldiers but his efforts are thwarted by a drunken scout who intentionally mistranslates the negotiations. The soldiers then open fire on the village and the warriors fight back. Many are killed on both sides, including Conquering Bear. (Note: this event is based on the August 1854 Grattan massacre.) A few years later, another Wheeler cousin, Samson Wheeler (Matthew Modine) has moved to Lawrence, Kansas with his family‚Äîhis wife Susannah (Rebecca Jenkins), sons Aaron (Greyston Holt) and Jeremiah (James Kirk), and adopted daughter Clara (Rachael Leigh Cook). An anti-slavery Unionist himself, Samson allies with the abolitionist Jayhawkers during the days of \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" as tensions rise in the months leading up to the Civil War. He refuses to leave the town despite being threatened by Border Ruffian leader Bloody Bill Anderson (Christian Bocher) for hiring Henry Foster (Kwesi Ameyaw), a black worker. Lawrence is later attacked by Anderson's bushwackers and Quantrill's Raiders. In the raid, Samson, Susannah and their two sons are killed, leaving Clara as the only survivor. She then leaves Kansas to seek out her cousins in Omaha, Nebraska. Jacob Wheeler's sons take different paths. Abe Wheeler (Christian Kane) has become a rider for the Pony Express. Despite being an excellent rider, he loses his job when the Pony Express is superseded by the telegraph. Jacob Wheeler, Jr. (Tyler Christopher) also decides to leave the family ranch to strike out on his own. Leaving California for the great plains, his knowledge of the Lakota language is valuable to the army and he is hired as a scout. Dog Star's son, Brings Horse (Nathaniel Arcand) is shot by an army sniper when he climbs a telegraph pole to investigate the wires strung from the top and cutting them. Sleeping Bear (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse), Dog Star's surviving son, pledges revenge against the whites for what they have done. ===Episode 4: \\"Hell on Wheels\\" === In December 1863, Clara Wheeler makes her journey to Omaha and finds her cousins, Daniel Wheeler (Lance Henriksen), his wife Esther (Jane E. Goold) and his children Robert (Warren Kole), Jackson (Glen Powell Jr.), Thomas (Kurt Sorenson) and Lilly (Mia Stallard). Daniel is pursuing the family trade as a wheelwright. He is not happy to see Clara (in the previous episode Samson mentioned that he never was on good terms with Daniel, although the reason is never revealed) and intends to send her away to the war-raged East, but he is persuaded by his wife and his son Robert to take Clara in, on the condition that Robert takes the sole responsibility for Clara. The race is on as the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads lay down tracks across the U.S., bringing East and West together. Jacob Wheeler's son Abe joins the construction crew of the Central Pacific railroad, working east from Sacramento. Working conditions are hard, and many workers leave to prospect for gold in the Californian goldfields. Chinese workers (\\"Coolies\\") are brought in from San Francisco to supplement the work crews. Abe meets and befriends Chow-Ping Yen (Garrett Wang), and they work in difficult conditions into and through the Sierra Nevada. Chow-Ping saves Abe's life when he almost falls from a bosun's chair while setting dynamite to construct a shelf along a cliff face. In March 1864, while photographing California Governor Frederick Low, Ethan Biggs and his wife, Margaret Light Shines (Jacob's daughter), decide to see the Indian Territory, and they take a stagecoach to Denver. In Denver, they hear Colonel John Chivington (Tom Berenger) speak against the Indians and recruit for the Third Colorado Cavalry. Ethan and Margaret's stagecoach is ambushed by Cheyenne warriors after leaving Denver. The other passengers are killed, but they are captured by Roman Nose (Rod Rondeaux) and taken to the camp of Black Kettle. Although the Cheyenne are hostile at first, Ethan and Margaret demonstrate their photographic equipment to the curious Cheyenne, and come to appreciate the Indian's hospitality. While Ethan photographs the people of Black Kettle's camp, Margaret works to establish peace between the Cheyenne and the local Governor and Army. On September 28, 1864, Black Kettle holds council with Colorado Territory Governor John Evans, Colonel Chivington and Major Wynkoop (Arron Shiver), to ensure peace. (Major Wynkoop's character is based on Silas Soule.) The Indians make clear their desire for peace, but the negotiations end inconclusively. Margaret and Ethan decide to continue their journey, but, on November 29, 1864, the night before they have planned to leave, Colonel Chivington attacks Black Kettle's village at the head of the Third Colorado Cavalry. Most of the village, including Ethan, are killed at the Sand Creek Massacre. Margaret is saved by Black Kettle and flees with the survivors. Further altercations between the Indians and the American settlers leads Red Cloud (Raoul Trujillo) to begin to gather the forces that will lead to Red Cloud's War. On December 21, 1866, a large band of Cheyenne and Sioux under Crazy Horse (Tatanka Means) attack a supply train near Fort Phil Kearny. Capt. Fetterman (Dylan Kenin) leads a relief party of 80 men. Ignoring orders not to venture beyond Lodge Trail Ridge, he led his troops into an ambush. He and his entire party were killed in the attack, later called the Fetterman Massacre. General William Tecumseh Sherman meets with Black Kettle and other Indian Chiefs, and Margaret watches another treaty being signed. Despite the treaty, Col George Armstrong Custer (Jonathan Scarfe) and the 7th Cavalry attack Black Kettle's Cheyenne village at the Battle of Washita River on November 27, 1868. Jacob Jr. has been serving as a scout for the U.S. Army with Custer. Margaret is taken captive with other Indian women. They are taken to an Army Fort, where she is reunited with her brother Jacob Jr., who tries to help her escape. She refuses, insisting on staying with her adopted Indian family. Eventually, the U.S. Army abandons some forts, and the second Treaty of Fort Laramie creates the Great Sioux reservation. Abe Wheeler continues to work on the railroad until the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed on May 10, 1869, when the driving of the Golden Spike joins the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads at Promontory Summit in Utah. Abe parts company with Chow-Ping. Meanwhile, Daniel Wheeler is seeking fortune by collaborating with Central Pacific Railroads and creating railroad boomtowns, exploiting the debaucheries of new settlers. He starts with North Platte, Nebraska with his sons Robert and Jackson as assistants, and by May 1868 they are in Cheyenne. Robert brings Clara along, and romance develops between them, while Daniel strongly disapproves their relationship. Robert disagrees with Daniel's corruptive way of business, and grows distant from his father. After the Transcontinental Railroad is completed, Robert and Clara decide to strike out on their own, leaving behind the life dominated by the greedy Daniel. ===Episode 5: \\"Casualties of War\\" === Gold is discovered in the Black Hills in 1874. The Black Hills are considered by the Lakota to be the axis mundi, or center of the world, and the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie granted the Indians ownership of the mountain range. Now, settlers trespass on their land to prospect for gold, and the U.S. Army moves in to take possession. Conflict over control of the region sparks the Black Hills War, the last major Indian War on the Great Plains. Red Cloud (Raoul Trujillo) continues to talk of peace with the whites at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, but many young men leave to join Sitting Bull (Eric Schweig), including cousins White Bird (Kalani Queypo)‚Äîson of Sleeping Bear and grandson of Dog Star (Gil Birmingham)‚Äîand Red Lance (Eddie Spears)‚Äîgrandson of Running Fox (Russell Means) and son of White Crow (David Midthunder). Red Lance's younger brother, Voices That Carry (Nakotah Larance), wants to go with his brother, but is required to stay behind with his grand- uncle Dog Star because of his youth. Red Cloud thinks that the \\"peace talkers\\" from Washington will honor the Treaty of Fort Laramie and keep other whites out of the Black Hills. Robert Wheeler is operating a general store in Hillsgate, Dakota Territory, while Clara spends her spare time teaching the town's children. Their store prospers as a result of the Black Hills Gold Rush and the many who rush into the area to find gold. In October 1874, Robert agrees to take a prospector into the Black Hills for $10, but they are attacked by two bushwhackers and the prospector is killed. Robert kills the two bushwhackers in turn with his Sharps Buffalo Rifle. Though he is safely home, Clara is angry with Robert for risking his life to make money. Clara buys a typewriter from a traveling salesman. Robert invests the profits from the store in about 100 Buffalo hides for $3 each, expecting to make a profit from the craze for buffalo bedspreads and overcoats, but finds that fashions have moved on and he cannot sell them to Douglas Hillman (Judge Reinhold) for more than $1 each. Instead, he gives them to the needy Indians at a nearby reservation. While there, he meets Captain Richard Henry Pratt (Keith Carradine), who commends his actions. Margaret Light Shines (Irene Bedard) has been a prisoner of the Army since the Battle of Washita River, but she finds purpose helping the women and orphaned children at the same Indian Reservation as Red Cloud. Voices That Carry runs away from the camp of Red Cloud to join his father, White Crow, with Sitting Bull. In June 1876, Jacob Wheeler Jr. (Tyler Christopher) is still a scout for Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer (Jonathan Scarfe) and the 7th U.S. Cavalry. On the morning of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Custer dispatches Jacob Jr. with a message to Captain Frederick Benteen. Jacob Jr. gives a letter for his parents to a friend who is assigned to Major Marcus Reno's group, in case he should not survive Custer's plan. As he foresaw, Jacob is killed before he finds Benteen, as Crazy Horse and a Lakota-Northern Cheyenne combined force wipe out Custer's cavalry detachment. Among those who are also killed is White Bird. Voices That Carry brings the body of his cousin back to Dog Star in Red Cloud's camp. After the final letter from Jacob Jr. reaches them, Jacob (John Terry) and Thunder Heart Woman (Sheila Tousey) go to Hillsgate in an effort to find Jacob Jr.'s resting place. They meet Robert and Clara, who take them to the scene of the battle. It is then learnt that Robert and Clara had a son, William, who died from a fever. Clara is unable to let go of the painful memory and there is some strain in her relationship with Robert. Following the defeat of the Sioux and their allies later in 1876, the United States \\"purchased\\" the Black Hills region (no actual purchase was ever completed and this area is under dispute to this day). In 1879, Richard Henry Pratt returns to Hillsgate, and invites Robert and Clara to join him in teaching at an experimental school in Pennsylvania designed to \\"civilize\\" Native American children. Pratt persuades the Lakota that their children need to learn the white men's ways. He takes 125 Lakota children to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. President Rutherford B. Hayes had arranged for the Carlisle Barracks to be made available. Among the children is Voices That Carry, who encourages the other Native Americans to resist assimilation. Voices That Carry's numerous attempts to undermine the process upset Pratt, but Robert tries to convince the boy to work hard so he can record the story of his people. Voices That Carry and Robert form a tentative friendship. After 6 months in Carlisle, Robert falls out with Pratt over his strict teaching methods, and heads back for home with Clara, who is now bearing their second child. Before they set off, Clara leaves her typewriter to Voices That Carry. ===Episode 6: \\"Ghost Dance\\" === Ten years have passed since the end of Episode 5. Robert (Craig Sheffer) and Clara Wheeler (Joanna Going) return home, disillusioned by the school they have been hired to run, and Clara begins to teach Native American children on the reservation. Loved by the Buffalo (Joseph M. Marshall III) believes he has found the foretold prophet when a mysterious Indian named Wovoka (Jonathan Joss) inspires his people with the Ghost Dance and a vision of their restored land at a Paiute reservation, the Yerington Indian Colony near Yerington, Nevada. But the ritual stirs up more fear among those who wish to contain the Native Americans. Voices That Carry (Chaske Spencer) is reunited with his brother Red Lance (Eddie Spears). Within weeks, the Ghost Dance becomes a phenomenon in the reservation. Local white governors and suppliers, who are tasked with the job of providing clothing and food for the Natives, become fearful of an Indian uprising. Local newspaper reporters overly exaggerate the dance as being sadistic and rebellious in nature. Margaret Light Shines is living in the reservation to help tend to the local children and sick. One of the newspaper reporters, not realizing she speaks English and knows how to use a camera, confronts her and trades his camera for a Ghost Shirt. Margaret Light Shines then uses the camera to record her version of the history. After Sitting Bull is \\"accidentally\\" killed by Indian Police sent by the Indian Agent, the Ghost Dance rebellion grows, which in turn leads to more brutality toward the Native Americans. Indian Agent Daniel Royer (David Paymer), fearful of the Ghost Dance, sends for help and Colonel James W. Forsyth arrives with the 7th Cavalry Regiment. The 7th Cavalry regiment moves outward from the reservation into the hills and valleys restricted of Indian settlement where Big Foot (George Aguilar) and his followers are hiding out. Fearful of the slaughter of his people who are poorly armed, Big Foot agrees to return to the reservation peacefully. Jacob Wheeler (John Terry) and his wife Thunder Heart Woman (Sheila Tousey) decide to move to South Dakota to settle in with the people they care about‚ÄîRobert and Clara. Margaret Light Shines walks past and sees a missing person search notice (put up by Robert) and realizes her family is nearby. She is taken back by Robert and reunites with her parents. While on the journey back to the reservation settlement, the groups stop and rest at a valley called Wounded Knee. While there, Colonel Forsyth requests Big Foot's men turn over all their weapons. They do so peacefully; however, when Forsyth sees how few arms Big Foot's men are carrying, he becomes angry. Believing his reports that Big Foot's men were well armed, the soldiers begin tearing apart the camp, taking anything that could be used as a weapon, including sticks and utensils. One of Big Foot's warriors, Black Coyote (Tokala Clifford), is deaf and did not hear the request to turn in his gun. When a U.S. soldier attempts to pry it from his hands, the gun goes off by accident. The American soldiers then open fire at will upon Big Foot and his people. While Big Foot's men rush to pick up their weapons and defend themselves, the women and children run in opposite directions only to be mowed down by the 7th Cavalry's gunfire. Most of the Natives, including Big Foot, are slaughtered. Robert Wheeler, who was attached to the 7th Cavalry in supplying Big Foot's men with blankets and food, survives the massacre but was injured by artillery. The survivors of the massacre are marched back to the reservation. Word goes round rapidly about the slaughter and Margaret Light Shines goes out to the field at Wounded Knee to photograph the massacre. While there, she meets and photographs the newspaper reporter who sold her the camera, who is looking with horror at the sight of the hundreds of frozen dead bodies which he indirectly had contributed to. She is also reunited with her uncle Loved By the Buffalo, who is performing the death rites for the deceased. Margaret brings him to meet her parents, Thunder Heart Woman and Jacob Wheeler. Loved By the Buffalo and Jacob Wheeler meet again, closing a circle that began many years ago, and Loved By the Buffalo comes to realize that his destiny was not to prevent what was destined to happen, but to preserve it and the memory of his people; to teach the young Lakota children the ways of their people. \\"So long as there are still a few Lakota left who understand the traditional ways of their people, the tribe, history, and the memories and lessons of our past can still be preserved so that future generations may also learn from them.\\" The final scene shows Loved By the Buffalo sitting with a group of Lakota children, Margaret, and Thunder Heart Woman, teaching them the past of the people and his own experiences. At the same time miles away, Robert and Clara are expecting another child. Jacob is sitting on the porch with Robert and Clara's son Jedediah (Dax Ansley), telling him about his own experiences, past, and the lessons he has to teach. * \\"The only history a man knows for certain is that small part he owns for himself.\\"‚ÄîJacob Wheeler * \\"I always told my children‚Äîyou are one part Lakota and one part Virginia‚Äîbe proud of both.\\"‚ÄîJacob Wheeler * \\"When you tell these stories, you touch the Grandmothers and Grandfathers.\\"‚ÄîLoved by the Buffalo ==Cast== Listed below are the major characters and the actors who play them.

Schulze's experiments with silver nitrate were undertaken in about 1717.This date is commonly misreported as 1725 or 1727, an error deriving from the belief that a 1727 publication of Schulze's account of experiments he says he undertook about two years earlier is the original source. In fact, it is a reprint of a 1719 publication and the date of the experiments is therefore circa 1717. The dated contents page of the true original can be seen here (retrieved 2015-02-21) He found that a slurry of chalk and nitric acid into which some silver had been dissolved was darkened by sunlight, but not by exposure to the heat from a fire. To provide an interesting demonstration of its darkening by light, he applied stencils of words to a bottle filled with the mixture and put it in direct sunlight, which produced copies of the text in dark characters on the surface of the contents. The impressions persisted until they were erased by shaking the bottle or until overall exposure to light obliterated them. Because they were produced by the action of light, an extremely broad and literal definition of what a photograph is may allow even these fluid, ephemeral sun printings to qualify, and on that basis many German sources credit Schulze as the inventor of photography.Litchfield, Richard Buckley (1903). Tom Wedgwood, the First Photographer, etc., London, Duckworth and Co. Out of copyright and available free at archive.org. In Appendix A (pp. 217-227), Litchfield evaluates assertions that Schulze's experiments should be called photography and includes a complete English translation (from the original Latin) of Schulze's 1719 account of them as reprinted in 1727. Though Schulze's work did not provide a means of permanently preserving an image, it did provide a foundation for later efforts toward that end. Thomas Wedgwood and Humphry Davy produced more substantial but still impermanent shadow images on coated paper and leather around the year 1800. Nic√©phore Ni√©pce succeeded in photographing camera images on paper coated with silver chloride in 1816 but he, too, could not make his results light-fast.Ni√©pce House Museum: Invention of Photography: 1816-1818, Ni√©pce's first tries (retrieved 2012-11-01) The first permanent camera photograph of this type was made in 1835 by Henry Fox Talbot. ==Works== * Abhandlung von der Stein-Chur durch innerliche Artzeneyen √ºberhaupt und insonderheit von der neulich bekannt gewordenen Englischen .

Numerous Puebloan Indian tribes have lived in the Jemez Mountains region since before the Spanish arrived in New Mexico. The Pueblo Indians of this region are the Towa-speaking Jemez people for which this mountain range is named, the Keres- speaking Keresan Indians, and the Tewa-speaking Tewa Indians. TsƒÖmpiye'ip'ƒØn is the Tewa language name for the Jemez Mountains. The highest point in the range is Chicoma Mountain (also spelled as Tschicoma or Tchicoma) at an elevation of . The town of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos National Laboratory adjoin the eastern side of the range while the town of Jemez Springs is to the west. Pajarito Mountain Ski Area is the only ski area in the Jemez. New Mexico State Highway 4 is the primary road that provides vehicular access to locations in the Jemez Mountains. ==Geology== Jemez Mountains near Jemez Pueblo The Jemez Mountains lie to the north of the Albuquerque Basin in the Rio Grande rift. They are a classic example of intracontinental volcanism and consist of a broadly circular ridge surrounding the famous Valles Caldera. The latter is the type location for resurgent caldera eruptions. The mountains lie on the intersection of the western margin of the Rio Grande Rift and the Jemez Lineament. Here magma produced from the fertile rock of an ancient subduction zone has repeatedly found its way to the surface along faults produced by rifting. This has produced a long-lived volcanic field, with the earliest eruptions beginning at least 13 million years ago and continuing almost to the present day, the most recent known eruption being the obsidian of the Banco Bonito flow, dated to 68.3 ¬± 1.5 thousand years before the present. Most of the volume of the range is composed of pre-caldera basalts, andesites, and dacites of the Keres Group and Polvadera Group, but there are extensive outflow sheets of the Bandelier Tuff and young rhyolites associated with caldera resurgence, all assigned to the Tewa Group. The two most recent caldera-forming eruptions, dated to about 1.62 million and 1.256 million years ago, produced massive ignimbrite deposits known as the Otowi and Tshirege members, respectively, of the Bandelier Tuff. Much of the material in these deposits now forms the Pajarito Plateau, a scenic region of canyons and mesas on which Los Alamos is situated. Redondo Peak, the second-highest summit in the range at 11,254 ft (3431 m), is a resurgent dome in the middle of the Valles Caldera, which also contains several smaller volcanos. The caldera is segregated by these structures and its rim into multiple lush grass valleys (valles in Spanish, hence the name). ==Public use== Jemez Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest Much of the range is federal land, including Santa Fe National Forest, Bandelier National Monument, and the Valles Caldera National Preserve. State lands include Fenton Lake State Park Official website: Fenton Lake State Park at in Sandoval County. Hiking trails crisscross the range and lead to many of the summits, although some regions are closed to hikers either because of environmental restrictions or because they are on the territory of Santa Clara Pueblo or private landholders. (Access to pueblo lands is available by permit.) The summits are generally easy to climb (in good weather) and require no technical climbing skills, but rock climbing is popular on some of the basalt cliffs near Los Alamos, Caja del Rio and elsewhere in the range. The mountains also are home to Pajarito Mountain, a small downhill ski area and offer some opportunities for cross country skiing, although not every winter produces enough snow to support this recreational activity. The region is prone to forest fires because of the tendency for spring weather to be dry and windy, creating conditions under which fires caused by human activities or lightning can spread rapidly. The Las Conchas Fire in 2011 was the most recent large wildfire. Parts of Los Alamos National Laboratory were also damaged, although none of the laboratory's special nuclear materials were threatened or released. ==Communities== Census- designated places within the Jemez Mountains include Jemez Springs and Jemez Pueblo. ==Wildlife== The Jemez Mountains house the American elk (wapiti), the golden-mantled ground squirrel, the Gunnison's prairie dog, American beavers, black bears, and mountain lions. The Jemez Mountains are also home to a federally endangered species, the Jemez Mountains salamander. ==ReferencesSanta Fe National Forest (Forest Service site) * First Photo from Space identifies Jemez Mountains as \\"Valle Grande Mts\\" Category:Mountain ranges of New Mexico Category:Volcanoes of New Mexico Category:Volcanic fields of New Mexico Category:Landforms of Sandoval County, New Mexico Category:Landforms of Rio Arriba County, New Mexico Category:Landforms of Los Alamos County, New Mexico Category:Landforms of Santa Fe County, New Mexico Category:Volcanic groups Category:Pleistocene volcanism ","title":"Jemez Mountains"},{"id":"1996738","text":"Wahalak is a small unincorporated community in central Kemper County, Mississippi. It is best known as the temporary hideout of fugitive Kenny Wagner, who was on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list in the 1950s. In late December 1906, Wahalak and Scooba, Mississippi, were the sites of white rioting against blacks. In the various conflicts, a total of 12 blacks and two whites were killed by December 26. The county sheriff called in the state militia for assistance.\\"Whites in Race War Kill Blacks Blindly/ Innocent Negroes Shot in the Mississippi Trouble\\", New York Times, December 26, 1906; accessed May 28, 2017. ==History== The name reputedly comes from a Choctaw language word meaning \\"running water\\". The settlement developed along what was known as Wahalak Creek. After the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was constructed through Kemper County later in the 19th century, this small settlement relocated several miles west in order to have access to it. The railroad built a train depot and a US post office was established for Wahalak. Passenger trains serving the town included those known as the Doodlebug and the Rebel. In the early 20th century, residents could travel directly from Wahalak to such places as Memphis, Tennessee, on the Mississippi River to the north and Mobile, Alabama, on the Gulf Coast to the south. After the discontinuation of passenger train service in the 1950s, due to a decline in demand as people bought cars and used federally subsidized highways, the village declined in population. The last Postmistress was Allene Bruton, who also ran a small general store. In the early 21st century, Wahalak has two churches and one restaurant. Wahalak is remote even by Kemper County standards. It is in the near-geographic center between Meridian and Columbus, Mississippi. The nearest movie theaters or shopping malls are more than 45 miles away. The nearest soda vending machine is located in Scooba, 7 miles away. ==References== ==External links== *\\"History of Wahalak\\", RootsWeb Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Kemper County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Meridian micropolitan area ","title":"Wahalak, Mississippi"},{"id":"1996740","text":"The Rio Grande Bible College (RGBI) is a Christian bible college in Edinburg, Texas.

Her partner and husband is Mariusz Siudek. They are the 1999 World bronze medalists, two-time (1999, 2000) European silver medalists and two-time (2004, 2007) European bronze medalists. They were the first Polish pair to medal at the World Championships. == Career == Zag√≥rska was introduced to figure skating by a cousin. After spending her early years as a single skater, she partnered with Janusz Komendera to compete in pairs. They won silver nationally and finished 18th at the 1994 European Championships. Zag√≥rska teamed up with Mariusz Siudek in 1994. In their first season together, the pair won their national title and were sent to the 1995 European and World Championships, finishing 9th and 16th in their debuts. The following season, they placed 8th in their Champions Series (later renamed Grand Prix) debut at the 1995 Troph√©e de France. In the 1997‚Äì1998 season, Zag√≥rska / Siudek were 4th at the 1998 European Championships. They finished 10th at their first Olympics, in Nagano, Japan, and ended the season at the 1998 World Championships where they placed 5th. In 1998‚Äì1999, Zag√≥rska / Siudek won their first European medal, silver, at the 1999 European Championships. They went on take bronze at the 1999 World Championships, becoming the first Polish pair to win a World medal. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Zag√≥rska / Siudek won their first Grand Prix medals, both bronze, at the 1999 Troph√©e Lalique and 1999 NHK Trophy and then won another silver medal at the European Championships. The next season, the pair won their third GP medal, also bronze, at the 2000 Cup of Russia but Zag√≥rska's ankle injury led the pair to withdraw from the 2001 Europeans after the short program. In the 2001‚Äì2002 season, Zag√≥rska / Siudek picked up their fourth GP medal, another bronze, at the 2001 NHK Trophy. They withdrew from the 2001 Troph√©e Lalique after Siudek twisted his knee in the warm-up before the free skate. They competed at their second Olympics, finishing 7th. During the next Grand Prix season, they obtained bronze at the 2002 Bofrost Cup on Ice and silver at the 2002 NHK Trophy. In spring 2003, Zag√≥rska / Siudek moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to work with Richard Gauthier. The pair won bronze medals at the 2003 Skate Canada International and 2003 NHK Trophy and then their third European medal, bronze, at the 2004 European Championships. In the 2004‚Äì2005 season, Zag√≥rska / Siudek added two more bronze medals to their Grand Prix collection at the 2004 Skate Canada International and 2004 NHK Trophy. They had to withdraw from their third GP event, the 2004 Cup of Russia, after Zag√≥rska injured her shoulder in a fall during the short program. The injury also caused them to miss the 2005 Europeans. In 2005‚Äì2006, Zag√≥rska / Siudek took bronze at their two Grand Prix events, the 2005 Cup of Russia and 2005 Cup of China. They finished 9th at their third Olympics. Although the pair had originally planned to retire after that season, they decided to compete one more season because the 2007 European Championships were assigned to Warsaw, Poland. Zag√≥rska began using her married surname, Siudek, during their final competitive season. The Siudeks won silver at the 2006 Skate America, bringing their GP medal total to 13. In Warsaw, they obtained the bronze medal, marking their fourth podium finish at the European Championships. The Siudeks withdrew from the 2007 World Championships due to an injury sustained by Mariusz during the long program. The pair announced their competitive retirement following the event. They returned to Poland and began coaching in Toru≈Ñ. Their former students include Stacey Kemp / David King. Dorota Siudek is an International Technical Specialist for Poland. == Personal life == Siudek proposed to Zag√≥rska during the 2000 World Championships, and they were married on 13 May 2000. Their son, Richard, was born on 7 July 2009. == Programs == (with Siudek) {| class=\\"wikitable\\"  |- ! Season ! Short program !

On 15 June that year, the National Front marched through London's West End; their march was to finish with a meeting in Conway Hall, Red Lion Square. The London Area Council for Liberation conducted a counter demonstration which consisted of a march through London ending with a public meeting in Red Lion Square. Warwick student Kevin Gately was killed during the demonstrations and a public enquiry was conducted by Lord Scarman into the disorders at Red Lion Square. ==Introduction== The British far-right organisation, the National Front booked Conway Hall in Red Lion Square for a meeting to take place on 15 June 1974. A counter-demonstration was called by the London Area Council of Liberation (formerly the Movement for Colonial Freedom). This counter-demonstration attracted support from groups not directly under the control of Liberation, including the International Marxist Group (IMG), the Communist Party of England (Marxist-Leninist) and the International Socialists (later the Socialist Workers Party). The counter-demonstration assembled on the Embankment and marched to Red Lion Square without incident. They planned to hold an open-air meeting on the north side of the Square, away from Conway Hall. ==Clash in Red Lion Square== The front of the Liberation march came westwards along Theobald's Road and entered Red Lion Square by Old North Street before turning right where a platform was set up for the meeting. A police cordon blocked the square to the left of Old North Street. A substantial number of marchers passed this cordon peacefully and assembled in front of the platform where the Labour MP for Southall Syd Bidwell was to address them. The cordon was then charged by the larger contingent from the IMG who were closely followed by the smaller CPE(M-L) contingent. Several minutes of pushing and scuffling followed. There were several charges and counter-charges. The police cordon was reinforced by members of the Special Patrol Group and by mounted police who eventually succeeded in forcing the demonstrators back. Photos show the use of truncheons by some police officers. At least one demonstrator reported being knocked to the ground and trampled by a police horse. Many demonstrators were forced back up Old North Street but a few retreated into the square. The police then forcibly cleared all remaining demonstrators from the square whether they had taken part in the original confrontation or not. Many demonstrators had passed the police cordon peacefully before the charge. Demonstrators from the International Socialists were specifically instructed by their stewards to withdraw from the area of fighting. Nonetheless, the police aggressively forced all the Liberation marchers from the square, in spite of the remonstrations of Syd Bidwell MP. ==Clash in Vernon Place== Soon after this, word spread among the Liberation demonstrators that the National Front were approaching. Many demonstrators regrouped at the junction of Vernon Place and Southampton Row where they were held back by a police cordon on the east side. The National Front, accompanied by an Orange fife and drum band, marched down Bloomsbury Way to the west side of Southampton Row where another police cordon stopped them. Neither side attempted to breach the cordons that separated them. After a few minutes mounted police came up Southampton Row from Red Lion Square and moved straight into the Liberation crowd without warning. Supported by foot police, they used truncheons on demonstrators in an apparently indiscriminate manner. Another police cordon behind the crowd effectively prevented their escape and many arrests were made. Many demonstrators were arrested. Photos show that many who were arrested had their hair pulled or were otherwise treated with what appeared to be excessive force by police. While this was happening the National Front were allowed to turn right into Southampton Row and escorted round the south side of Red Lion Square into Conway Hall. ==Clash in Boswell Street== A small remnant of the IMG contingent went up Boswell Street in an attempt to disperse. They were followed and trapped by police who detained the group while they were attempting to arrest Brian Heron, one of the IMG leaders. They eventually succeeded but he escaped from them a few minutes later. This incident was overlooked in most of the media coverage but was reported in the following week's edition of Time Out. ==Death of Kevin Gately== Kevin Gately was a student at Warwick University who accompanied fellow students to the counter-demonstration. Gately was not a member of a political group and had never been on a demonstration before. As some of the Warwick students were supporters of the IMG, all of them marched with the IMG contingent and were caught up in the initial clash in Red Lion Square. Photos show Gately moving through the crowd, possibly trying to escape from the tight press of bodies during the pushing at the police cordon. His unconscious body was found by police after the crowd was driven back and taken in an ambulance to University College Hospital. Gately's fellow students only realised that he was missing when they met after the demonstration ended. A student who enquired at University College Hospital was shown Gately's body and asked to identify him. A coroner's inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court concluded that Gately's death was the result of a blow to the head from a blunt instrument. Left wing newspapers at the time blamed his death on the mounted police though this was based on supposition and conclusive evidence has not been forthcoming. Kevin Gately was the first demonstrator to be killed in Britain in 55 years. ==Aftermath== There was widespread press and media coverage of the disorders in Red Lion Square Warwick University students held a march and vigil in Coventry during the following week. The next Saturday, 22 June 1974, a silent march retraced the route of the Liberation counter-demonstration from the embankment to Red Lion Square. The march was led by personal friends of Kevin Gately, followed by University of Warwick students and then by students from many other universities and colleges as well as contingents from many of the left wing groups that had taken part in the original march. This march also received widespread media coverage. The Inquest into Kevin Gately's death was followed by a public enquiry headed by Lord Scarman which considered a wide range of evidence from police and marchers. The International Marxist Group leaders on 15 June ‚Äì Brian Heron and David Bailey ‚Äì initially denied charging the first police cordon but later admitted doing so to the Scarman tribunal. The sabbatical officers of University of Warwick Students' Union commissioned a Kevin Gately memorial painting which still hangs in the student union building. It was restored in 2004. ==External links== * On This Day, BBC News, 15 June 1974. * Tony Gilbert, Only One Died: An Account of the Scarman Inquiry into the Events of 15th June 1974, in Red Lion Square, when Kevin Gately Died Opposing Racism and Fascism.

Formally established in 1921, the Profintern was intended to act as a counterweight to the influence of the so-called \\"Amsterdam International\\", the Social Democratic International Federation of Trade Unions, an organization branded as class collaborationist and an impediment to revolution by the Comintern. After entering a period of decline in the middle 1930s, the organization was finally terminated in 1937 with the advent of the Popular Front. ==Organizational history== ===Preliminary organization=== Solomon Lozovsky, head of the Red International of Labor Unions. In July 1920, at the behest of Comintern head Grigory Zinoviev, the 2nd World Congress of the Communist International established a temporary International Trade Union Council, commonly known by its Russian acronym, Mezhsovprof.E.H. Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923: Volume 3. London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 207. This organizing committee ‚Äî including members of the Russian, Italian, British, Bulgarian, and French delegations to the Comintern Congress ‚Äî was presented with the task of organizing \\"an international congress of Red trade unions. Soviet trade union leader Solomon Lozovsky was named president of this new council, assisted by British unionist Tom Mann and Alfred Rosmer of France. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) directed the new council to issue a manifesto to \\"all trade unions of the world\\", condemning the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions based in Amsterdam as a \\"yellow\\" organization and inviting them to join a new revolutionary international union association. This decision was to mark a split of the international trade union movement that followed the recently achieved split of the international socialist political movement into revolutionary Communist and electorally-oriented Socialist camps. This desire for a new exclusive international of explicitly \\"Red\\" union represented a fundamental contradiction with the Comintern's firm insistence that Communists should work within the structure of existing trade unions ‚Äî an important detail noted at the time by delegate Jack Tanner of the British Shop Stewards Movement.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 208. Tanner's objection was brushed aside as Grigory Zinoviev denied him the floor, referring his complaints to committee. Historian E.H. Carr argues that the decision to launch a Red International of Labor Unions at all was a byproduct of the era of heady revolutionary fervor that world revolution was around the corner, declaring: > \\"It was a step taken in a moment of hot-headed enthusiasm and the firm > conviction of the imminence of the European revolution; and a device > designed to bridge a short transition and prepare the way for the great > consummation had unexpected and fatal consequences when the interim period > dragged on into months and years.\\" As the plan for a new labor international moved forward, Mezhsovprof established propaganda bureaus in different countries in an attempt to win the existing unions affiliated to the rival \\"Amsterdam International,\\" as the International Federation of Trade Unions was commonly known, over to the forthcoming \\"Red International.\\"Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 398. These bureaus attracted the most rebellious and dissident trade unionists to their banner while at the same time alienating sometimes conservative union leaderships, already raising charges that what was actually being proffered was dual unionism and a destructive split of the existing unions. On January 9, 1921, ECCI decided that the launch of a new Red International of Trade Unions would take place at a conference to be convened on May Day of that year. An appeal was issued to the trade unions of the world who were \\"opposed to the Amsterdam International\\" and called for their affiliation to the new organization. This conclave was ultimately postponed until July, however, so that it could be synchronized with the scheduled 3rd World Congress of the Comintern ‚Äî travel to and from Soviet Russia being a difficult and dangerous process in these years. Grandiose claims were made about the new organization, with Lozovsky declaring in a speech in May 1921 that already unions representing 14 million workers had proclaimed their allegiance to the forthcoming Red International.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 399. Zinoviev ferociously declared the Amsterdam International to be \\"the last barricade of the international bourgeoisie\\" ‚Äî fighting words to social democratic trade unionists. For their own part, the Social Democratic trade union movement emerged from World War I relatively united, on the offensive, and unbowed. Even before the Profintern was launched, the line in the sand was clearly drawn, with the Amsterdam International declaring at a May 1921 executive session that it was \\"not permissible for trade union organizations to be affiliated to two trade union International at the same time\\" and adding that \\"every organization which affiliates to the political trade union International of Moscow places itself outside the International Federation of Trade Unions.\\"First Report on the Activities of the International Federation of Trade Unions (July 1919-December 1921). Amsterdam: n.d.; pg. 73. Cited in E.H. Carr, Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 1. London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 526. The great civil war within the world trade union movement had begun. ===The foundation congress of 1921=== The short-lived official organ of RILU, published in Moscow, was The Red Labor Union International. This journal was soon supplanted by a variety of publications produced by RILU's member sections. The Founding Congress of the Red International of Trade Unions was convened in Moscow on July 3, 1921. The gathering was attended by 380 delegates from around the world, including 336 with voting rights, claiming to represent 17 million of the 40 million trade union members worldwide. The gathering was neither homogeneous nor harmonious, as it quickly became clear that a number of delegates held a syndicalist perspective that sought to avoid politics and participation in the existing trade unions altogether, in favor of direct action leading to workers' control of industry. These delegates sought the new Red International of Labor Unions to be fully independent of the Communist International, seen as a political organization. Among those expressing such a desire for the organizational independence of RILU from the Comintern was \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) ‚Äî an individual already living in Moscow after skipping bail to avoid a lengthy prison sentence under the Espionage Act.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pp. 399-400. The IWW's perspective was joined by syndicalist trade unionists that were part of the French and Spanish delegations. Ultimately, however, the syndicalist elements proved a small minority and the Congress approved a resolution sponsored by Mann and Rosmer which called for \\"the closest possible link\\" between the Profintern and Comintern, including joint sessions of the organizations, as well as \\"real and intimate revolutionary unity\\" between the Red unions and the Communist parties at the national level.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 400. Despite the initiative of starting a new trade union international in direct competition with the previously existing Amsterdam international, the Profintern in its initial phase continued to insist that its strategy was not to \\"snatch out of the unions the best and most conscious workers,\\" but rather to remain in the existing unions in order to \\"revolutionize\\" them.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 527. The founding Congress's official resolution on organization declared that the withdrawal from the existing mass unions and abandonment of their memberships to their often conservative leaderships \\"plays into the hands of the counter-revolutionary trade union bureaucracy and therefore should be sharply and categorically rejected.\\" Still, the Profintern insisted upon a real split of the labor movement, establishing conditions for admission which included \\"a break with the yellow Amsterdam International.\\"Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 528. The organization effectively advocated that radicalized workers engage in \\"boring from within\\" the existing unions in order to disassociate the full organizations from Amsterdam and for Moscow. Such tactics insured bitter internal division as non-Communist members of the rank- and-file and their elected union leaderships sought to maintain existing affiliations. As part of its strategy for winning over the existing unions, the Profintern decided to establish a network of what it called \\"International Propaganda Committees\\" (IPCs), international associations of radical unions and organized fractional minorities in unions that were established on the basis of their specific industry.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 531. These groups were intended to conduct conferences and publish and distribute pamphlets and periodicals in order to propagandize for the idea of revolution and for the establishment the dictatorship of the proletariat.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pp. 531-532. The IPCs were to attempt to raise funds to help sustain their efforts, with the governing Executive Bureau of Profintern subsidizing their publications.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 532. By August 1921 a total of 14 IPCs had been established. The Profintern's International Propaganda Committees proved ineffectual in changing the opinions of union memberships.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 533. Unions began to expel their radical dissidents and international unions began to expel those national sections which participated in the activities of the Profintern, exemplified by the October 1921 expulsion of the Dutch Transport Workers' Federation from its international trade organization. ===The 2nd World Congress of 1922=== Veteran activist Clara Zetkin (left) was the face of the \\"united front\\" efforts of the Comintern and Profintern following the 2nd World Congress of RILU in 1922. The 2nd World Congress of RILU was held in Moscow in November 1922, in conjunction with the 4th World Congress of the Comintern. As might be expected, the 1922 RILU Congress spent much of its time shaping the application of the Comintern's recently adopted united front policy to the trade union movement.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 459. With the prospects for imminent world revolution on the wane, RILU head Solomon Lozovsky proposed an international conference bringing together leaderships of RILU, the Amsterdam International, and various unaffiliated unions ‚Äî a gathering which was to echo the April 1922 meeting between the Second International, the Two- and-a-Half International, and the Comintern in Berlin \\"to work out parallel forms and methods of struggle against the offensive of capitalism.\\" In retrospect, 1922 marked the high-water mark for the Profintern's size and influence in Europe, with a sizable new contingent joining the organization's ranks in France when the Conf√©d√©ration Gen√©rale du Travail (CGT) attempted to discipline and expel its syndicalist members but ended up causing a full scale organizational split in which the majority of French trade unionists affiliated with a new \\"Red\\" union.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pp. 459-460. Additional headway was made in Czechoslovakia, where a majority of trade union members similarly affiliated with RILU,Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 460. following a campaign of expulsions of Communist individuals and unions by the Social Democratic leadership.E.H. Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pp. 171-172. In October 1922 the Czech Red unions held a congress of their own, formalizing the split with the Social Democratic unions. It is worthy of mention that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was an extremely large organization in this period, claiming 170,000 members in 1922, dwarfing all but a few Communist parties around the world.E.H. Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 170. In Bulgaria the All-Bulgarian Federation of unions chose to affiliate with the Profintern outright, but even that movement was split when opponents established a rival organization called the Free Federation of Trade Unions.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 536. Spain, too, saw its national labor movement formally divided.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 538. The climate was acrimonious as bitter charges and counter-charges levying responsibility for the shattering the trade union movement flew in all directions. The professed desire of the Profintern for a united front came to fruition of sorts in December 1922, when the organization met at a peace conference in The Hague with representatives of the rival Amsterdam International, presided over by British union leader J.H. Thomas.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 462. As was the case with the meeting of the three political Internationals earlier in the year, the session ended in failure, with accusations flying in both directions and Lozovsky's plea for a united front arbitrarily dismissed as a transparent tactical ploy. This failure was followed up in January 1923 by a joint appeal of the Comintern and Profintern for the creation of an \\"action committee against fascism,\\" followed in March with the establishment of a formal Action Committee Against Fascism in Berlin, headed by Clara Zetkin.E.H. Carr, The Interregnum, 1923-1924. London: Macmillan, 1954; pg. 161. An international conference of this group was called to be held later that same month in Frankfurt, Germany with invitations extended to the parties of the Second International and the unions of the Amsterdam International, but only a few Social Democrats attended, the overwhelming majority of the gathering being Communists. Delegates from Germany, Soviet Russia, France, and Britain united to denounce the Versailles Peace Treaty and the related Occupation of the Ruhr by France to enforce the onerous reparations levied against Germany. The die had been cast, however, and no joint activities between the political or union leaders of the Social Democratic and Communist Internationals would be result from the initiative. Lozovsky reported on RILU's progress to the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in April 1923, at which he claimed that the Profintern represented 13 million unionists against 14 or 15 million for the rival Amsterdam International.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 461. This figure is regarded by at least one serious historian of the matter as \\"probably exaggerated.\\" ===The 3rd World Congress of 1924=== Soviet trade union chief Mikhail Tomsky was the key figure in a Soviet effort to establish close bilateral relations with the British union movement during the middle 1920s. The 3rd World Congress of the Profintern opened on July 8, 1924, having been scheduled to begin in Moscow immediately following the 5th World Congress of the Comintern (June 17 to July 8, 1924). Seventy delegates from the Profintern were made \\"consultative\\" (non-voting) delegates to the Comintern gathering, assuring a very close connection between the two gatherings.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 70. The 1924 Congress formally marked a hardening of the Communist attitude towards the Social Democratic labor movement, declaring that \\"fascism and democracy are two forms of the bourgeois dictatorship.\\"Desiat' let Profinterna v rezoliutsiakh (Ten Years of the Profintern in Resolutions). Moscow: 1930; pg. 144. Cited in Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 84n. The most contentious issue debated by the Congress related to the strategy and tactics of seeking unity with the Amsterdam International, thereby bringing an end to the disruption suffered by the labor movement as a result of the split into two internationals.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 564. With forcing the IFTU to capitulate untenable and independent entry of the Russian trade unions into their the industrial federations affiliated with the IFTU, the sole option remaining, in Solomon Lozovsky's view, was to attempt to achieve some sort of fusion of the two Internationals through an international conference. Lozovsky contended that unity was not to be achieved through the sacrifice of the Profintern's program or tactics and the blind acceptance of reformism, but rather was to be accompanied by the penetration of communist ideas into the minds of the rank-and-file trade unionists of the European unions. A proposal was made by Gaston Monmousseau of France calling for a World Unity Congress of the Red and Amsterdam Internationals, and a committee of 35 delegates was selected to debate the proposal and to flesh out the practical details.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pp. 564-565. Following two days of debate, the commission reported back to the assembled Congress, bringing with it a unity proposal that had been accepted in the preliminary hearings with one sole dissenting vote.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 565. The final proposal for a unity congress proved little more than a platitude, however, with the resolution declaring that such a gathering \\"might, after suitable preparation of the masses\\" prove appropriate. There was no firm directive instructing the Profintern Executive Board to action. With relations between the Profintern and the IFTU at the point of insoluble stalemate, Soviet trade union authorities began to concentrate on bilateral relationships with social democratic union movements.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 570. Particular attention was placed on the unions of Great Britain, with Russian union chief Mikhail Tomsky traveling to the UK in 1924, followed by a reciprocal visit in November of that year of a high-level delegation headed by A.A. Purcell of the Trades Union Congress.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pp. 569-570. From the Soviet standpoint the British unionists were positively affected by their visit, publishing an extensive and generally favorable report of the Soviet situation upon their return to the UK.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 572. This month-long visit of the British trade union delegation would be the prototype for a series of similar visits of the Soviet Union by western union leaders. While the groundwork for ties between the Soviet and western trade union movement began to be successfully laid, the situation between the international organizations based in Amsterdam and Moscow festered. The Second International and the IFTC held a joint meeting in Brussels during the first week of January 1925 and emerged with a scathing denunciation of the Soviet Union and its sympathizers in the British trade union movement that were organized in a RILU-subsidized organization known as the National Minority Movement.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 573. A similar presence in the American Federation of Labor in the form of the Trade Union Educational League went without comment owing to the AFL's ongoing refusal to affiliate with the Amsterdam International. These objections by the IFTU failed to stymie continued development of bilateral Soviet-British ties, however, as in April 1925 Tomsky returned to London as part of an effort to establish a joint committee for trade union unity between the two countries.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 576. If Tomsky had the ulterior motive of seeking to win British unionists to the ranks of the Profintern, he was met with a surprising reversal, as E.H. Carr noted in 1964: > \\"The British leaders had little interest in Profintern, which they secretly > regarded, from the experience of the British movement, either as a nuisance > or as a sham, and wished, by reconciling the Soviet trade unions with the > existing [Amsterdam] International. to strengthen it and give it a turn to > the Left. The British delegates probably shocked their Soviet colleagues by > coming out openly in favour of the affiliation of the Russian unions to > IFTU.\\"Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 577. Tomsky, although diplomatic in his reply, rejected the British suggestion out of hand as an abject surrender to the Amsterdam International akin to the 1918 forced surrender of Soviet Russia to Imperial Germany at Brest-Litovsk. Still, with the New Economic Policy in full swing in Soviet Russia, with its associated liberalization of culture and trade, the position of the Soviet trade union movement with relationship to social democratic unions in the West was secure and orderly, despite the failure of efforts to parlay with top leaders of the Amsterdam International. ===RILU in the East=== As was the case with the Communist International, formal World Congresses of RILU happened with decreasing frequency over the life of the organization. This stands to reason, since RILU World Congresses were scheduled in conjunction with the World Congresses of the Comintern itself, generally launching upon conclusion of the Comintern event. And just as the Comintern began making use of shorter, smaller, and less formal international conventions called \\"Enlarged Plenums of the Executive Committee\\" to handle international policy-making, similar gatherings were adopted for RILU, called \\"Sessions of the Central Council.\\" The 4th Session of the Central Council, held in Moscow from March 9‚Äì15, 1926, began just as the 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI came to a close. At both of these gatherings Solomon Lozovsky had delivered reports which identified Great Britain ‚Äî where a miners' strike was in the air ‚Äî and in particular the countries of Asia and the Pacific as areas presenting the greatest opportunities for the Profintern in its attempt to construct a world revolutionary movement.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 1, pg. 592. Amsterdam had paid scant attention to Asia, leaving the field open to the Profintern's efforts, Lozovsky noted in his report to the Comintern Executive. RILU did make an effort to break new organizational ground outside of Europe as early as February 1922 when it established a Moscow office comparable to the Comintern's Eastern Bureau, headed by Buffalo, New York druggist Boris Reinstein, Bulgarian-American IWW member George Andreychine, and H. Eiduss.Ruth McVey, The Rise of Indonesian Communism. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1965; pg. 214. But now, even as European prospects dimmed, the situation looked brighter in Asia and the Pacific. Best of all, from the perspective of the Profintern, was the situation in China, with a young and radical worker's movement beginning to spring to life. Soviet prestige and influence had grown in China throughout the early 1920s, particularly from 1924, when diplomatic recognition by the Peking government and an agreement on the Chinese Eastern Railroad was achieved.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 719-720. A Chinese labor movement began to take shape, driven by the efforts of railway workers and seamen to organize, backed with Moscow's support.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 720. In the South, a breakaway government based in Canton led by Sun Yat-sen pursued anti- imperialist objectives in conjunction with the Communist Party of China ‚Äî an estimated 40 of the 200 delegates at the January 20, 1924 founding convention of the Kuomintang (KMT) were said to be communists and the disciplined and centralized party established at that time clearly drew upon the Soviet Communist model.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 698-699. In June 1924 Sun's KMT government in Canton established its own military academy at Whampoa, aided by 3 million rubles in Soviet aid for the purpose as well as Soviet instructors, headed by Vasily Blyukher.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 702. The working alliance forged between KMT leader Sun and Mikhail Borodin, chief representative of the Comintern in China was lost following Sun's death in Beijing on March 12, 1925. After the leader's death, jockeying began between left and right factions in the KMT; tension between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party began to build without Sun's calming influence.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 719. On May 30, 1925, a strike in Shanghai of radical students protesting the arrest of some of their fellows who had been supporting a strike at a cotton mill was fired on by police, killing 12 protestors. A general strike was declared in the city in response and a \\"May 30 Movement\\" erupted throughout the region. On June 19 a general strike was called in Canton, followed four days later by another incident in which troops fired upon demonstrators in the streets, resulting in a new spate of casualties. The rapid growth of the May 30 Movement fueled the Comintern's interest in the revolutionary ferment in China.Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 628. This new perspective was emphasized by Joseph Stalin, beginning to emerge over the Comintern's Grigory Zinoviev as top leader of the USSR, who in early July 1925 agreed with a reporter for the Tokyo newspaper Nichi Nichi Shimbun that the revolutionary movement in China, India, Persia, Egypt and \\"other Eastern countries\\" were growing and that \\"the time is drawing near when the Western powers will have to bury themselves in the grave they have dug for themselves in the East.\\"J.V. Stalin, Works: Volume 7, 1925. Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1954; pg. 235. E.H. Carr cites this passage in Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 628, providing his own translation from the Russian edition of Stalin's Sochineniia. He does not make adequately clear that the exact words used by Stalin repeat those of his interlocutor and that Stalin is merely concurring with the sentiment expressed. ===Personnel and branches=== The full-time secretariat of RILU consisted of the Spaniard, Andr√©s Nin, the Russian trade unionist Mikhail Tomsky and General Secretary Solomon Lozovsky. In addition to its Moscow headquarters, RILU soon established four overseas offices ‚Äî Berlin (\\"Central European Bureau\\"), Paris (\\"Latin Bureau\\"), Bulgaria (\\"Balkan Bureau\\") and London (\\"British Bureau\\"). In May 1927, the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat was established in Shanghai as RILU's coordinating center for Asia and the Pacific. In 1928, RILU launched the Confederaci√≥n Sindical Latino-Americana (CSLA) as the Latin American branch of RILU ‚Äî the first general labor movement in Latin America.William Z. Foster, History of the Three Internationals: The World Socialist and Communist Movements from 1848 to the Present. New York: International Publishers, 1955; pg. 326. This group was the forerunner of the Confederaci√≥n de los Trabajadores de Am√©rica Latina (CTAL), established in 1936. RILU established national sections around the world. In Britain, the Bureau worked closely with the National Minority Movement. The Communist Party of Canada established a national section called the Workers' Unity League. The American section began in 1922 as the Trade Union Educational League, succeeded in 1929 by a more radical variant which attempted to establish dual unions, the Trade Union Unity League. ===Dissolution=== The Profintern was dissolved in 1937 as Stalin's foreign policy shifted towards the Popular Front. == Meetings == {| class=\\"wikitable\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"Background:#ffffff\\" |- ! width=20%| Gathering ! width=14%| Location ! width=16%| Date !

It is a 150-metre-long street with window prostitution on both sides. The area has about 69 windows with rooms. Mainly Eastern European women work there. ==Windows== There are about 69 windows with rooms. The rate paid by prostitutes to rent rooms is 125 Euros per day, with prostitutes applying daily for rooms on a first come, first served basis. The windows are all privately owned and the street is administered under the guidance of the Municipal government and police. There is a private security service and security cameras for safety. In order to prevent exploitation and trafficking a number of measures are in place: * Owners of the windows can have no financial involvement with the tenants * Prostitutes must be over 21 years of age and have identity papers, be registered with the municipality of Alkmaar (GBA) and the Chamber of Commerce (KvK), as well as health insurance. * Prostitutes have to be interviewed and there is an in-depth check on their identity papers before they are allowed to rent a window * Third parties may not rent windows on behalf of the prostitutes The rent for the room includes cleaning, maintenance, towels, bed linen and wi-fi. Opening hours are from 09:00 to 01:00. The prostitutes are all members of the Association of Achterdam and are visited weekly by support workers from Aanloophuis De Steiger. Medical check-ups are available on alternate Tuesdays ==History and municipal policy== Prostitution has been practiced in Alkmaar for at least two centuries. In 1811, the French government (Alkmaar was part of the French Empire at this time) set regulations for \\"huizen van ontucht\\" in Alkmaar. This was one of the first cities with rules for prostitution. In 1991, the city council adopted a policy paper ' (\\"Prostitution and other sex institutions\\"). It was intended to be model European prototype. The Achterdam window prostitution it proposed was first operational in 1973. Following the October 2000 abolition of the law banning brothels, sex establishments in Alkmaar, such as the houses on the Achterdam, have been allowed provided they have a license from the municipal council. In the 2000s there were between 120 and 125 prostitution windows operating in Achterdam. From May 2001, prostitutes needed full EU passports or EU residence permits to work in Achterdam. As a result, all Bulgarians and Rumanians women could no longer work in Achterdam. This left a number of empty windows which were filled by other East Europeans, Latin American women and (older) Dutch sex workers. During the 2000s there were complaints about the alleged nuisance resulting from prostitution in Achterdam. This led to the windows having to close by 1am. In 2004 and again in 2015, the window operators held an \\"open day\\" during which members of the public could tour the premises and speak to the prostitutes. In 2007 licenses were revoked for brothels alleged to be involved in money laundering. Following changes in licensing rules in 2011 the number of prostitution windows was limited to a maximum of 69. In 2012 the Central Alkmaar Residents' Association campaigned for the end of all window prostitution in Achterdam, while the window operators proposed an end to the 69-window limit. There have been anti-trafficking raids at various times. The biggest was in March 2013 when more than 500 employees of the Municipality of Alkmaar, Public Prosecutor¬ís Office and the police were involved in the raid. All prostitutes, window owners and anybody in the street at the time were arrested and questioned. ==Criminality== Two prostitutes were murdered in Achterdam in 1996. One of the murderers was identified from CCTV but fled the country. The second murderer was never identified. In 2007, 92 of the windows were run by Koos Nool, who also owned some of the windows. Others were owned by Cor van Hout, who was involved in the kidnapping of Freddy Heineken. When Nool applied to renew his licenses, Alkmaar Mayor Piet Bruinooge refused the license renewal on the advice of the Bureau BIBOB,Uitspraak Raad van State, Bestuursrechtspraak, 20 juli 2011, zaaknummer 200909931/1/H3. on suspicion of money laundering and that the windows had been brought with money from crime.NRC Handelsblad, 20 juli 2011.Uitspraak Raad van State 20 juli 2011 (zie eerdere voetnoot), punt 2.4NRC Handelsblad, 12 november 2009. Nool challenged the decision in the Alkmaar Court, which decided there was \\"insufficient information on the serious risk that the permit would be misused for illegal purposes\\". On appeal in the Administrative Law Division of the Council of State (ABrVS), based on further information from the Bureau BIBOB, the Court ruled the Mayor had been justified in refusing the permit application. A number of females of Turkish-German descent were convicted of human trafficking in 2008 (the so-called SNEEP Case). They had been forcing women, mostly from East Europe, to work as prostitutes. The victims were lured to the Netherlands and forced to work in the windows. Some women were forced to undergo breast enlargement surgery and have the traffickers initials tattooed on their neck. A Moroccan man was jailed for 1 year for trafficking a girl to Achterdam in November 2010. In March 2013 two men, one Hungarian, the other Romanian, were was arrested for human trafficking during a raid on Achterdam. In November that year another man was arrested, again for trafficking. ==See also== * Prostitution in the Netherlands * Human trafficking in the Netherlands ==References== Category:Alkmaar Category:Red-light districts in the Netherlands ","title":"Achterdam"},{"id":"1996801","text":"This is a list of compositions for cello and piano.

The epicenter was offshore, southeast of Long Beach, California, on the Newport‚ÄìInglewood Fault. The earthquake had a magnitude estimated at 6.4 , and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Damage to buildings was widespread throughout Southern California. 115 to 120 fatalities and an estimated forty million dollars' worth of property damage resulted. The majority of the fatalities resulted from people running out of buildings exposing themselves to the falling debris. ==Damage== Compton High school The major damage occurred in the densely-populated city of Long Beach on the south-facing coast of Los Angeles County. However, the damage was also found to have extended to the industrial area south of downtown Los Angeles. The magnitude of the earthquake is considered to be medium but a significant amount of damage was left due to unfavorable geological conditions (landfill, water-soaked alluvium) combined with poorly constructed buildings. In Long Beach, buildings collapsed, water tanks fell through roofs, and houses were tossed off their foundations. School buildings were among the structures that incurred the most severe damage. It was recognized that unreinforced masonry bearing walls is the reason for school buildings suffering so much damage in the wake of the earthquake. ==Aftermath== The earthquake highlighted the need for earthquake-resistant design for structures in California. Many school buildings were damaged, with more than 230 school buildings that either were destroyed, suffered major damage, or were judged unsafe to occupy. The California State Legislature passed the Field Act on April 10, 1933, mandating that school buildings must be earthquake-resistant. If the earthquake had occurred during school hours, the death toll would have been much higher. This earthquake prompted the government to play an active role in disaster relief. The government created The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, providing loans for the reconstruction of buildings that were affected during the natural disaster. The Bureau of Public Roads also took action to rebuild roads, highways, and bridges. The economy of Long Beach was able to return to normal swiftly because of the rise of the aircraft industry. To support the World War II efforts, Long Beach created naval yards and increased the number of aircraft produced. This directly helped Long Beach repair and stabilize the economy after the disaster. ==Popular culture== The 1933 film Headline Shooter, uses newsreel footage of the Long Beach earthquake. The earthquake plays a major part in the novel The Last Tycoon (1941), by F. Scott Fitzgerald. During the disruption caused by the quake, the hero, Monroe Stahr, meets Kathleen Moore, with whom he falls in love. The earthquake is also included in John Fante's Ask the Dust (1939). A radio newscast announces the aftermath of the earthquake in Season One, Episode Five of The Waltons. This earthquake was mentioned by one of the guest characters, played by actor Ian Wolfe in Season Three, Episode One of Police Woman, who also mentions the 1971 San Fernando earthquake as the \\"Big One of '71\\". Footage of the earthquake appeared in the film Encounters with Disaster, released in 1979 and produced by Sun Classic Pictures. ==See also== * List of earthquakes in 1933 * List of earthquakes in California * List of earthquakes in the United States ==References== ==External links== * USGS Historical Earthquakes ‚Äì Long Beach, California ‚Äì United States Geological Survey * 75th Anniversary of the 1933 Long Beach Earthquake ‚Äì California Department of Conservation * National Information Service on Earthquake engineering page about Long Beach earthquake ‚Äì National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering * Catastrophe: A Bad One ‚Äì Time * Long Beach Earthquake: March 10, 1933 Cloyd E.

On September 27, 1747, he married Elizabeth Sanderson in County Durham, England. His son, Robert, was born . ==Military Service== Agnew came to Boston in the latter part of 1775, holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel. By 1777, he had been appointed a local brigadier general and commanded a brigade. General Agnew was engaged at the Battle of Long Island in 1776. In 1777, Agnew accompanied British forces under the command of General William Tryon and General William Erskine on an inland raid against Patriot supply depots in Danbury, Connecticut. After successfully destroying Patriot supplies, the British forces engaged and defeated Continental Army Generals David Wooster, Benedict Arnold, and Gold S. Silliman and Patriot militiamen in the Battle of Ridgefield. Lastly, Agnew was at the Battle of the Brandywine, where he was wounded. While leading his 4th brigade in support of Lord Cornwallis at the Battle of Germantown, General Agnew was killed by a civilian sharpshooter named Hans Boyer.

He was a prolific author of newspaper contributions on most political and social questions of his time, with a particular interest in land and parliamentary reform. ==Early activity== Walton worked as a stonemason and builder, and joined the Operative Masons' Society. He became a supporter of Robert Owen, and was active in the Chartist movement in the late 1840s. He joined the National Association of United Trades, and when he started to advocate a scheme for home colonisation (1848‚Äì49). He expanded on the latter interest in his most important work, the \\"History of the Landed Tenures of Great Britain and Ireland from the Norman Conquest to the present time\\" which was published in 1865. With this book, which was quoted by Karl Marx in vol. III of 'Capital', he emerged as one of the most vocal spokesmen for the issue of land nationalisation. == Welsh Based protagonist == In the 1860s, he also became a protagonist of the reform campaign. He did so from Brecon in South Wales where he had moved at the beginning of the decade. His radical ideas made him join several important democratic societies, such as the International Working Men's Association (IWMA, First International), the Reform League and several cooperative building schemes. He also tried several times to be elected a member of Parliament, first for Brecon, then for Stoke-on-Trent in the Potteries. However, due to local political circumstances, he failed in each attempt. == Latter Years == In the 1870s he moved to London, where he spent his last years less involved in radical campaigns but still writing pamphlets and contributions to newspapers. ==Further reading== J.

In keeping with an established Maserati tradition, it is named after a wind: shamal (Arabic for ‚Äònorth‚Äô), a hot summer wind that blows in large areas of Mesopotamia, particularly in the large plain between the Tigris and Euphrates. With its newly developed twin-turbocharged V8, the Shamal was Maserati's flagship grand tourer, topping the lineup of V6-engined Biturbo coup√©s in both performance and price (at 125 million Lire). ==History== The Shamal was introduced on 14 December 1989 in Modena, when Maserati president and owner Alejandro de Tomaso showed it to the press. It was the last model announced under the De Tomaso ownership: in January 1990, half of debt-plagued Maserati was acquired by Fiat S.p.A.. Sales began in 1990. The final year of production for the Maserati Shamal was 1996; factory figures indicate that 369 examples were produced. ==Design== Maserati Shamal rear, side view The Shamal was designed in collaboration by Marcello Gandini and Maserati's own Styling department.Alfieri, p. 17 A debt ridden Maserati was not able to develop an entirely new car, and accordingly the Shamal shows its Biturbo heritage in the doors, interior, and basic bodyshell, which were carried over from the Biturbo. It sits on the shorter 2.4-meter wheelbase, as also used by the Biturbo Spyder and Karif. Gandini's styling signature is visible in the slanted profile of the rear wheel arch, also present on the Quattroporte IV and first seen on the Lamborghini Countach. An unusual design element introduced by Gandini on the Shamal was the additional spoiler in front of the windshield, also seen on his redesign of the DeTomaso Pantera and later across the remainder of Maserati's Biturbo-based lineup. It was intended to direct the flow of air (as well as water) across the windscreen and to push the wipers down at high speeds.Alfieri, p. 18 The feature was never adapted by other automakers. The center pillar is also an actual roll bar, not simply a styling element.Alfieri, p. 20 Finished in black, it wraps around the cabin. \\"Shamal\\" badging appears on either side of the central pillar in chrome lettering. The car came with 16-inch alloy wheels, a small rear spoiler and a blacked-out grille with chrome accents, the only chrome element on the car aside from the badging. Another defining feature of the Shamal are its numerous headlamps in individual housings: outer round Carello low beams of the then-new projector type, inner rectangular high beams, combined turn signals and position lamps in the bumper, and two pairs of square lights in the lower grille‚Äîfog lamps and driving lamps. This headlight design was then introduced across the rest of the updated Biturbo range in 1991. The two-seat interior of the Shamal features extended leather seat cushions, temperature control and the famous Maserati oval clock, which is situated in the centre of the dashboard. It continued Maserati's tradition of building cars with cheerful, well-appointed interiors, with leather or wood coverings for almost anything one would touch, such as the center console, handbrake handle, or the gear lever which is finished in burled elm.Alfieri, p. 33 While built for comfort as well as performance, the Shamal was not as luxuriously appointed as the contemporary Ghibli. The Shamal was initially only available in red or black exterior colours; other colours became available later in the production run. ==Specifications== Rear view The Shamal used a traditional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and an all-steel unibody construction. Suspension was by MacPherson struts upfront and semi-trailing arms at the rear. All cars were equipped with an adaptive suspension developed by Maserati together with Koni. The system varied the damping rates, based on road conditions and the level of comfort desired. Mechanically, the Shamal was unusual in that its engine could be removed without a lift. It is mounted on a subframe (which also holds the intercoolers and the radiator) which can be slipped out the front once the front bumper has been removed. The Shamal was powered by an AM 479 (bore and stroke ) V8 engine, with two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank, and four valves per cylinder. It was essentially the existing Biturbo V6 with an extra bank of cylinders added. It was twin-turbocharged with two IHI turbines and intercoolers, and equipped with a Marelli IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection ECU per cylinder bank. The engine put out at 6,000 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. Power was sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed Getrag G560 manual transmission and Maserati's Ranger limited-slip differential. The transmission was the same as BMW installed in their 850CSi of the same era. The manufacturer claimed a top speed of and a acceleration time of 5.3 seconds. ==References== ==External links== *Enrico's Maserati page on the Maserati Shamal Shamal Category:Sports cars Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:1990s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1989 ","title":"Maserati Shamal"},{"id":"1996834","text":"GIGA was the brand name of a digital TV channel (also known as GIGA Digital or GIGA TV) and several German television shows. The channel ceased operations in 2009. ==Early Days== The first GIGA show was broadcast on 30 November 1998. The show NBC GIGA was shown first time on the television channel NBC Europe. The show lasted five hours, from 3 pm until 8 pm. ==Broadcasts on own channel== In March 2005 the show was renamed from NBC GIGA to GIGA Green, airing on its own digital channel starting in September. Also in September 2005 the original show was renamed a second time, now to the simple name GIGA, which caused some confusion because the television channel on which it was broadcast was also named GIGA. The show had been shortened from five hours to three hours, Monday through Friday, and was now being broadcast on the television channel GIGA as well as on the television channel Das Vierte (English: The Fourth).

Released as the second single from the album, it reached No. 11 on the pop chart, No. 7 on the R&B; chart, and No. 1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. The song is sung by Shock G's alter ego, \\"Humpty Hump\\", marking the character's second musical appearance; the first was Digital Underground's \\"Doowutchyalike,\\" a pre-album video-single released in the spring of 1989. The song has been sampled by many different artists and producers. In the song's video, a young Tupac Shakur is visible in the background. In 2008, \\"The Humpty Dance\\" was ranked #30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop and #65 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s in 2007. The song was selected as one of many songs to hear and download in the musical reference book 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die: And 10,001 You Must Download. The song was nominated for Best Rap Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to \\"U Can't Touch This\\" by MC Hammer. Canadian television channel MuchMoreMusic's series Back In... rated the song's video as one of the worst of 1990. ==Composition== Of the five raw elements that make up the \\"Humpty Dance\\" drum track, one is a sample from \\"Sing a Simple Song\\" by Sly and the Family Stone, in the form of a one-measure-long drum loop. Digital Underground incorporated the Family Stone drum loop with four other raw elements; a deep tonal kick drum that alternated between two bass notes, a handclap snare (also a sample, taken from \\"Theme From the Black Hole\\" by the band Parliament), drum-machine hi-hats running continuously throughout which were programmed to 8th-notes, and a guitar hit happening once every bar, all assembled into the now-familiar pattern that forms the Humpty Dance drum track. The vocal sample that happens in the song's chorus sections is from Parliament's \\"Let's Play House\\" from their 1980 album, Trombipulation. ==Subject matter== \\"The Humpty Dance\\" is a tribute to Humpty's sexual prowess despite his ridiculous appearance. Humpty introduces the appearance theme with the opening line, \\"I'm about to ruin the image and the style that you're used to,\\" a protest against the uniformity among successful rappers of the time. In the final verse, Humpty describes the Humpty Dance itself as a loose, easy dance, \\"like MC Hammer on crack ... Anyone can play this game.\\" The contrast is with the precision dancing in MC Hammer's videos. The song ends with an invitation for people of all races to join in the dance. ==Humpty Hump== \\"The Humpty Dance\\" is Shock G's second song to feature his alter-ego \\"Humpty Hump,\\" who debuted on \\"Doowutchyalike\\" which was Digital Underground's first video release in 1989. The character, which sports a buffoon persona, colorful clothes, and Groucho glasses, is sung by Shock G. A fictional biography was constructed for Humpty, the story being that Edward Ellington Humphrey III, former lead singer of \\"Smooth Eddie and the Humpers,\\" had become a rapper after burning his nose in a kitchen accident with a deep-fryer. Because of the \\"accident\\", the character is seen wearing a large nose disguise. ==In popular culture== The song was featured in the VH1 series I Love the '90s, and also on America's Best Dance Crew, where it was included in a dance routine performed by Super Cr3w. The song was also featured in Charlie's Angels. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic covered the song for the polka medley \\"Polka Your Eyes Out\\" from his 1992 album Off the Deep End. The song is also available for play in the 2004 karaoke video game Get On Da Mic for PlayStation 2. It was sampled by Justin Timberlake, Jimmy Fallon on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and by the Spice Girls on their debut album Spice as the track \\"If U Can't Dance\\". In 1990, the song was used in the Season Three episode of the TV series Midnight Caller entitled \\"Sale Away: Part 2\\". ===Sampling \\"The Humpty Dance\\"=== \\"The Humpty Dance\\" is one of the most sampled songs recorded by a hip hop/rap artist, boasting over 100 usages in other songs. By 1993, less than three years after its release, it had already been sampled in over 20 popular songs, most of them utilizing its drum track. In fact, it was sampled so much that Digital Underground humorously devoted the song \\"The Humpty Dance Awards\\" from their album The Body-Hat Syndrome to the many recording artists who sampled the track. Since then, dozens more artists have sampled the Humpty Dance song, from Ice Cube to Public Enemy. * \\"A Crazy Break\\" ‚Äì WC & the Maad Circle (full drum loop) * \\"Ain't That a Bitch\\" ‚Äì Kam (full drum loop) * \\"Assata's Song (Remix)\\" ‚Äì Paris (full drum loop on bridge) * \\"Attention: The Shawanda Story\\" ‚Äì Lo-Key?

Nucleation is the first step in the formation of either a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure via self-assembly or self-organization. Nucleation is typically defined to be the process that determines how long an observer has to wait before the new phase or self-organized structure appears. For example, if a volume of water is cooled (at atmospheric pressure) below 0¬∞C, it will tend to freeze into ice, but volumes of water cooled only a few degrees below 0¬∞C often stay completely free of ice for long periods. At these conditions, nucleation of ice is either slow or does not occur at all. However, at lower temperatures ice crystals appear after little or no delay. At these conditions ice nucleation is fast. Nucleation is commonly how first-order phase transitions start, and then it is the start of the process of forming a new thermodynamic phase. In contrast, new phases at continuous phase transitions start to form immediately. Nucleation is often found to be very sensitive to impurities in the system. These impurities may be too small to be seen by the naked eye, but still can control the rate of nucleation. Because of this, it is often important to distinguish between heterogeneous nucleation and homogeneous nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation occurs at nucleation sites on surfaces in the system. Homogeneous nucleation occurs away from a surface. ==Characteristics== Nucleation at a surface (black) in the 2D Ising model. Up spins (particles in lattice-gas terminology) shown in red, down spins shown in white. Nucleation is usually a stochastic (random) process, so even in two identical systems nucleation will occur at different times. A common mechanism is illustrated in the animation to the right. This shows nucleation of a new phase (shown in red) in an existing phase (white). In the existing phase microscopic fluctuations of the red phase appear and decay continuously, until an unusually large fluctuation of the new red phase is so large it is more favourable for it to grow than to shrink back to nothing. This nucleus of the red phase then grows and converts the system to this phase. The standard theory that describes this behaviour for the nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is called classical nucleation theory. However, the CNT fails in describing experimental results of vapour to liquid nucleation even for model substances like argon by several orders of magnitude.A. Fladerer, R. Strey: ‚ÄûHomogeneous nucleation and droplet growth in supersaturated argon vapor: The cryogenic nucleation pulse chamber.‚Äú in: The Journal of Chemical Physics 124(16), 164710 (2006). (Online) For nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase, such as the formation of ice in water below 0¬∞C, if the system is not evolving with time and nucleation occurs in one step, then the probability that nucleation has not occurred should undergo exponential decay. This is seen for example in the nucleation of ice in supercooled small water droplets. The decay rate of the exponential gives the nucleation rate. Classical nucleation theory is a widely used approximate theory for estimating these rates, and how they vary with variables such as temperature. It correctly predicts that the time you have to wait for nucleation decreases extremely rapidly when supersaturated. It is not just new phases such as liquids and crystals that form via nucleation followed by growth. The self-assembly process that forms objects like the amyloid aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease also starts with nucleation. Energy consuming self-organising systems such as the microtubules in cells also show nucleation and growth. ===Heterogeneous nucleation often dominates homogeneous nucleation=== Three nuclei on a surface, illustrating decreasing contact angles. The contact angle the nucleus surface makes with the solid horizontal surface decreases from left to right. The surface area of the nucleus decreases as the contact angle decreases. This geometrical effect reduces the barrier in classical nucleation theory and hence results in faster nucleation on surfaces with smaller contact angles. Also, if instead of the surface being flat it curves towards fluid, then this also reduces the interfacial area and so the nucleation barrier. Heterogeneous nucleation, nucleation with the nucleus at a surface, is much more common than homogeneous nucleation. For example, in the nucleation of ice from supercooled water droplets, purifying the water to remove all or almost all impurities results in water droplets that freeze below around 35¬∞C, whereas water that contains impurities may freeze at 5¬∞C or warmer. This observation that heterogeneous nucleation can occur when the rate of homogeneous nucleation is essentially zero, is often understood using classical nucleation theory. This predicts that the nucleation slows exponentially with the height of a free energy barrier ŒîG*. This barrier comes from the free energy penalty of forming the surface of the growing nucleus. For homogeneous nucleation the nucleus is approximated by a sphere, but as we can see in the schematic of macroscopic droplets to the right, droplets on surfaces are not complete spheres and so the area of the interface between the droplet and the surrounding fluid is less than a sphere's 4\\\\pi r^2 . This reduction in surface area of the nucleus reduces the height of the barrier to nucleation and so speeds nucleation up exponentially. Nucleation can also start at the surface of a liquid. For example, computer simulations of gold nanoparticles show that the crystal phase nucleates at the liquid-gold surface. ===Computer simulation studies of simple models=== Classical nucleation theory makes a number of assumptions, for example it treats a microscopic nucleus as if it is a macroscopic droplet with a well-defined surface whose free energy is estimated using an equilibrium property: the interfacial tension œÉ. For a nucleus that may be only of order ten molecules across it is not always clear that we can treat something so small as a volume plus a surface. Also nucleation is an inherently out of thermodynamic equilibrium phenomenon so it is not always obvious that its rate can be estimated using equilibrium properties. However, modern computers are powerful enough to calculate essentially exact nucleation rates for simple models. These have been compared with the classical theory, for example for the case of nucleation of the crystal phase in the model of hard spheres. This is a model of perfectly hard spheres in thermal motion, and is a simple model of some colloids. For the crystallization of hard spheres the classical theory is a very reasonable approximate theory. So for the simple models we can study, classical nucleation theory works quite well, but we do not know if it works equally well for (say) complex molecules crystallising out of solution. ===The spinodal region=== Phase-transition processes can also be explained in terms of spinodal decomposition, where phase separation is delayed until the system enters the unstable region where a small perturbation in composition leads to a decrease in energy and, thus, spontaneous growth of the perturbation. This region of a phase diagram is known as the spinodal region and the phase separation process is known as spinodal decomposition and may be governed by the Cahn‚ÄìHilliard equation. ==The nucleation of crystals== In many cases, liquids and solutions can be cooled down or concentrated up to conditions where the liquid or solution is significantly less thermodynamically stable than the crystal, but where no crystals will form for minutes, hours, weeks or longer. Nucleation of the crystal is then being prevented by a substantial barrier. This has consequences, for example cold high altitude clouds may contain large numbers of small liquid water droplets that are far below 0¬∞C. In small volumes, such as in small droplets, only one nucleation event may be needed for crystallisation. In these small volumes, the time until the first crystal appears is usually defined to be the nucleation time. In larger volumes many nucleation events will occur. A simple model for crystallisation in that case, that combines nucleation and growth is the KJMA or Avrami model. ===Primary and secondary nucleation=== The time until the appearance of the first crystal is also called primary nucleation time, to distinguish it from secondary nucleation times. Primary here refers to the first nucleus to form, while secondary nuclei are crystal nuclei produced from a preexisting crystal. Primary nucleation describes the transition to a new phase that does not rely on the new phase already being present, either because it is the very first nucleus of that phase to form, or because the nucleus forms far from any pre- existing piece of the new phase. Particularly in the study of crystallisation, secondary nucleation can be important. This is the formation of nuclei of a new crystal directly caused by pre-existing crystals. For example, if the crystals are in a solution and the system is subject to shearing forces, small crystal nuclei could be sheared off a growing crystal, thus increasing the number of crystals in the system. So both primary and secondary nucleation increase the number of crystals in the system but their mechanisms are very different, and secondary nucleation relies on crystals already being present. ===Experimental observations on the nucleation times for the crystallisation of small volumes=== It is typically difficult to experimentally study the nucleation of crystals. The nucleus is microscopic, and thus too small to be directly observed. In large liquid volumes there are typically multiple nucleation events, and it is difficult to disentangle the effects of nucleation from those of growth of the nucleated phase. These problems can be overcome by working with small droplets. As nucleation is stochastic, many droplets are needed so that statistics for the nucleation events can be obtained. The black triangles are the fraction of a large set of small supercooled liquid tin droplets that are still liquid, i.e., where the crystal state has not nucleated, as a function of time. The data are from Pound and La Mer (1952). The red curve is a fit of a function of the Gompertz form to these data. To the right is shown an example set of nucleation data. It is for the nucleation at constant temperature and hence supersaturation of the crystal phase in small droplets of supercooled liquid tin; this is the work of Pound and La Mer. Nucleation occurs in different droplets at different times, hence the fraction is not a simple step function that drops sharply from one to zero at one particular time. The red curve is a fit of a Gompertz function to the data. This is a simplified version of the model Pound and La Mer used to model their data. The model assumes that nucleation occurs due to impurity particles in the liquid tin droplets, and it makes the simplifying assumption that all impurity particles produce nucleation at the same rate. It also assumes that these particles are Poisson distributed among the liquid tin droplets. The fit values are that the nucleation rate due to a single impurity particle is 0.02/s, and the average number of impurity particles per droplet is 1.2. Note that about 30% of the tin droplets never freeze; the data plateau at a fraction of about 0.3. Within the model this is assumed to be because, by chance, these droplets do not have even one impurity particle and so there is no heterogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation is assumed to be negligible on the timescale of this experiment. The remaining droplets freeze in a stochastic way, at rates 0.02/s if they have one impurity particle, 0.04/s if they have two, and so on. These data are just one example, but they illustrate common features of the nucleation of crystals in that there is clear evidence for heterogeneous nucleation, and that nucleation is clearly stochastic. ===Ice=== The freezing of small water droplets to ice is an important process, particularly in the formation and dynamics of clouds. Water (at atmospheric pressure) does not freeze at 0¬∞C, but rather at temperatures that tend to decrease as the volume of the water decreases and as the water impurity increases. Survival curve for water droplets 34.5 Œºm in diameter. Blue circles are data, and the red curve is a fit of a Gumbel distribution. Thus small droplets of water, as found in clouds, may remain liquid far below 0¬∞C. An example of experimental data on the freezing of small water droplets is shown at the right. The plot shows the fraction of a large set of water droplets, that are still liquid water, i.e., have not yet frozen, as a function of temperature. Note that the highest temperature at which any of the droplets freezes is close to -19¬∞C, while the last droplet to freeze does so at almost -35¬∞C. ==Examples== ===Examples of the nucleation of fluids (gases and liquids)=== * Clouds form when wet air cools (often because the air rises) and many small water droplets nucleate from the supersaturated air.H. R. Pruppacher and J. D. Klett, Microphysics of Clouds and Precipitation, Kluwer (1997). The amount of water vapor that air can carry decreases with lower temperatures. The excess vapor begins to nucleate and to form small water droplets which form a cloud. Nucleation of the droplets of liquid water is heterogeneous, occurring on particles referred to as cloud condensation nuclei. Cloud seeding is the process of adding artificial condensation nuclei to quicken the formation of clouds. * Bubbles of carbon dioxide nucleate shortly after the pressure is released from a container of carbonated liquid. Nucleation of carbon dioxide bubbles around a finger * Nucleation in boiling can occur in the bulk liquid if the pressure is reduced so that the liquid becomes superheated with respect to the pressure-dependent boiling point. More often, nucleation occurs on the heating surface, at nucleation sites. Typically, nucleation sites are tiny crevices where free gas-liquid surface is maintained or spots on the heating surface with lower wetting properties. Substantial superheating of a liquid can be achieved after the liquid is de- gassed and if the heating surfaces are clean, smooth and made of materials well wetted by the liquid. * Some champagne stirrers operate by providing many nucleation sites via high surface-area and sharp corners, speeding the release of bubbles and removing carbonation from the wine. * The Diet Coke and Mentos eruption offers another example. The surface of Mentos candy provides nucleation sites for the formation of carbon-dioxide bubbles from carbonated soda. * Both the bubble chamber and the cloud chamber rely on nucleation, of bubbles and droplets, respectively. ===Examples of the nucleation of crystals=== * The most common crystallisation process on Earth is the formation of ice. Liquid water does not freeze at 0¬∞C unless there is ice already present; cooling significantly below 0¬∞C is required to nucleate ice and so for the water to freeze. For example, small droplets of very pure water can remain liquid down to below -30¬∞ C although ice is the stable state below 0¬∞C. * Many of the materials we make and use are crystalline, but are made from liquids, e.g. crystalline iron made from liquid iron cast into a mold, so the nucleation of crystalline materials is widely studied in industry. It is used heavily in the chemical industry for cases such as in the preparation of metallic ultradispersed powders that can serve as catalysts. For example, platinum deposited onto TiO2 nanoparticles catalyses the liberation of hydrogen from water. It is an important factor in the semiconductor industry, as the band gap energy in semiconductors is influenced by the size of nanoclusters. === Nucleation in solids === In addition to the nucleation and growth of crystals e.g. in non-crystalline glasses, the nucleation and growth of impurity precipitates in crystals at, and between, grain boundaries is quite important industrially. For example in metals solid-state nucleation and precipitate growth plays an important role e.g. in modifying mechanical properties like ductility, while in semiconductors it plays an important role e.g. in trapping impurities during integrated circuit manufacture. ==References== Category:Particle detectors Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Bubbles (physics) ","title":"Nucleation"},{"id":"1996860","text":"The Fr√©jus Road Tunnel is a tunnel that connects France and Italy. It runs under Col du Fr√©jus in the Cottian Alps between Modane in France and Bardonecchia in Italy. It is one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes between France and Italy being used for 80% of the commercial road traffic. Construction of the long tunnel started in 1974, and it came into service on 12 July 1980, leading to the closure of the motorail shuttle service in the Fr√©jus rail tunnel. It cost 2 billion francs (equivalent to ‚Ç¨700 million at 2005 prices). It is the tenth longest road tunnel in the world. The French section is managed by the French company SFTRF, and the Italian section by the Italian company SITAF. (The French politician Pierre Dumas was chairman of SFTRF from 1962 to 1989). The tunnel can be reached from the Italian side by the A32 Torino-Bardonecchia motorway, or by SS335 from Oulx, which joins SS24 (‚Äúdel Monginevro‚Äù), and reaches Bardonecchia after . From the French side, it can be reached by the A43 (‚Äúl‚ÄôAutoroute de la Maurienne‚Äù) from Lyon and Chamb√©ry. A toll is charged to all traffic. Over 20 million vehicles passed through the tunnel during the first 20 years. ==Safety== Following a 1999 accident in the Mont Blanc tunnel, measures were taken at the start of 2000 to improve safety in the tunnel. A strict speed limit, and a safe distance of between vehicles was imposed. The tunnel was equipped with the latest smoke and flame detectors, and a system of videocameras in the tunnel to detect the speed of traffic, as well as fire and smoke. Temperature sensors were installed at short distances throughout the tunnel, monitored from a central control post. Fire hydrants were installed every 130 m, fed from large water tanks. There are 11 safety points along the tunnel, equipped with telephones and loud speakers connected to the control room, with a separate ventilation duct to supply fresh air. These are separated from the main tunnel by two fire doors; the outer door closes automatically when the temperature in the tunnel reaches a certain level. Finally there is a ‚Äòthermal gate‚Äô system at each entrance to identify any overheating vehicles. Despite these measures, on 4 June 2005, a fire caused the death of two Slovak lorry drivers, and the closure of the tunnel to traffic for several weeks. It reopened to cars on 4 August 2005, and later to commercial vehicles. The tunnel was also briefly closed due to non-fatal fires on 9 January 2007, 29 November 2010, and 10 April 2014. A second shaft, parallel to the existing one at a distance of , is under construction. Work began in 2009, following EU regulations put in place after the Mont Blanc Tunnel fire. Originally planned as an wide rescue tunnel, an agreement was reached in 2012 to open the new shaft to traffic towards France while converting one lane of the existing shaft into an emergency lane. The breakthrough occurred on 17 November 2014. The new shaft is due to open to traffic on October 1, 2021 at the earliest.Le second tube As there will still be a single lane for each direction (the other lane being an emergency lane), the capacity of the tunnel will remain unchanged.

He is most famous for being commissioned to formalize the image of Alfred E. Neuman for Mad. Lambiek Comiclopedia, https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mingo_norman.htm ==Biography== A prolific magazine illustrator in the Norman Rockwell vein, Mingo resided in the Chicago area for decades before retiring to Tarrytown, New York. As a child, he won an art contest, receiving art materials and a correspondence course as a prize. Mingo had early professional success, even dropping out of high school for a year due to his workload. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he ran a Chicago ad studio whose staff included future Captain Marvel artist C.C. Beck; the studio closed during the Great Depression. Thereafter he worked largely as a freelancer, including as an illustrator for various advertising agencies and magazines, including American Weekly, Ladies' Home Journal and Pictorial Review. He drew Hollywood paper doll books with oversized heads of actors such as Bette Davis, Deanna Durbin and Rita Heyworth. He provided a bikinied pin-up girl for a 1946 Mennen Skin Bracer advert, signed with his distinctive Mingo script.Cohn, Beverly, What a Year It Was!‚Äî1946, MMS Publishing, Marina del Ray, California, 1995, , page 154. In addition to pin-up art, he also illustrated for paperbacks (Pocket Books), served as a traditional portraitist, painting such subjects as General George S. Patton Jr., and drew numerous movie posters including Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Alfred E. Neuman on Mad #30 In 1956 Mingo answered a New York Times ad for an illustrator (\\"National magazine wants portrait artist for special project\\"), and was selected by Mad publisher William M. Gaines and editor Al Feldstein to create a warmer, more polished version of a public domain character the magazine had been using. Previously, the magazine had printed a rougher image and redrawings of the character, which were randomly dubbed \\"Melvin F. Coznowski\\" or \\"Mel Haney\\" in addition to \\"Alfred E. Neuman.\\" The Panglossian simpleton had appeared in many guises and variations since the 19th century, including in dental advertisements that assured the public of minimal tooth-pulling pain. Mingo's initial painting was the first time Neuman had appeared in color. Mad editor Al Feldstein recalled the day Mingo responded to the ad at the Mad offices: Permanently named \\"Alfred E. Neuman\\", the character became Mad magazine's mascot with issue #30. In November 2008, Mingo's original cover featuring the first \\"official\\" portrait of Neuman sold at auction for $203,150. Norman Mingo painted eight Mad covers in 1956-7 before his more regular work with the top-tier Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency took up all of his time. Mingo had actually landed both jobs on the same day. While working exclusively in advertising, Mingo illustrated campaigns for a variety of companies including General Mills cereal, L&M; cigarettes, Falstaff Beer and the U.S. Army. During Mingo's absence, Frank Kelly Freas rendered Neuman for Mad from 1958 to 1962. Mingo returned to Mad in 1962 and painted most of its front covers until 1976. Most of his Neuman images were a combination of watercolor and acrylics, but he occasionally experimented with different media. His last Mad cover appeared on issue #211 (December 1979). Mingo produced 97 Mad covers in total, plus over 100 additional cover images for Mads many reprint Specials and its line of paperbacks. He also drew occasional Mad-related assignments for others, such as an Alfred-ized version of beleaguered New York City Mayor Abe Beame in 1976 for the New York Times. Mingo's Mad cover total surpassed Freas' in 1965, and his leading status endured until 2016, when current contributor Mark Fredrickson became the most prolific Mad cover artist with his 98th cover. Combining the regular issues (including some back covers), the reprint \\"MAD Specials\\" and the paperbacks, Mingo produced more than 200 original covers for Mad. Fellow cover artists Jack Rickard and Bob Jones have remarked that Mingo was the only one who could paint the Neuman character perfectly \\"on model\\" every time. A born again Christian, Mingo began signing his covers (executed in gouache) with the ichthys beneath his name in 1975, beginning with Mad #174. At that time he and his wife Margaret attended the Second Reformed Church in Tarrytown, New York. In contrast to his usual rendering of the definitive Neuman face, Mingo created a dramatic variation in 1979, after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. On the back cover of issue #210, with an exaggerated version of the plant's meltdown in the background, Alfred stands in front of cracking cooling towers, sweating and hair standing on end, and abandons his trademark grin for a grimace as he says, \\"YES...ME WORRY!\\". 60 years old when he took his first Mad cover assignment, Mingo was the oldest of the magazine's regulars to make his debut. He was also the only veteran of the First World War ever to write or draw for Mad, having served three years in the Navy. Mingo died on May 8, 1980, after a lengthy illness.The New York Times, \\"Norman Mingo, 84, Illustrator Behind 'Alfred E.

She died in Reykjav√≠k during the worldwide pandemic of Spanish flu of 1918‚Äì1920. ==Work== She published her first short story in 1879 in Framfari, the first Icelandic newspaper published in North America.Lamonde, Y., Fleming, P.L., & Black, F.A., eds. History of the Book in Canada, Volume Two. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005. 46‚Äì47. Her first novel, Brynjolfur Sveinsson biskup, was published in Reykjav√≠k in 1882 and was both the first novel and first work by a female author to be formally printed in Iceland.\\"Continental and Foreign Jottings.\\" The Printing Times and Lithographer. XIII (15 November 1882). Elding (1889) is a historical novel. Some of her work appeared in a Danish periodical published in Chicago, Illustrered Familjeblad. After her return to Iceland she edited two literary journals, Draupnir and Dv√∂l, in which her short fiction and two later novels appeared, and a children's magazine, T√≠br√°. The folk tales she collected from Icelanders in Canada during her first few years there were published in 1962, and point, according to folklorist David Buchan, to an interesting difference between the Icelandic and the Faroese traditions; in the latter the ballad tradition is one of male public performance, where the Icelandic tradition is found in the female, domestic sphere. Her writing shows both romantic and realist traits; some of her short stories are fables and allegories, but others deal with contemporary life, with the importance of women's education as a recurring theme. As a historical novelist, she is credited with giving the genre \\"its most capable treatment\\" among Icelandic authors. == List of publications == ===Novels=== * Brynj√≥lfur Sveinsson biskup (1882) * Kjartan og Gu√∞r√∫n (1886) * Elding (1889) * H√∂gni og Ingibj√∂rg (1889) * J√≥n biskup V√≠dal√≠n (Draupnir) * J√≥n biskup Arason (Draupnir) ===Short fiction=== * \\"Spekingurinn og heimskinginn\\" (Framfari, 1878) * \\"Andvari\\" (Illustrered Familjeblad, Chicago, 1878) * \\"Gu√∞ heyrir b√∂rnin\\" (Framfari, 1878) * \\"Stjarnan m√≠n\\" (Framfari, 1878) * \\"Seint fyrnist forn √°st\\" (Framfari, 1879) * \\"T√°rabl√≥mi√∞\\" (Framfari, 1879) * \\"Hei√∞arb√¶rinn\\" (Framfari, 1879) * \\"Gunnl√∂g og Sigrid\\" (Illustrered Familjeblad, 1880) * S√∂gur og √¶vint√Ωri (1884; collection) * Sm√°s√∂gur handa b√∂rnum og unglingum (1886; collection of children's stories) * Barnas√∂gur (1890; collection of children's stories) * √ûj√≥√∞s√∂gur og sagnir (1962; ed.

It is located in Moffat County in the extreme northwestern corner of the state, in an isolated mountain valley of Browns Park on both sides of the Green River, approximately below Flaming Gorge Dam. Established in 1965, the refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service office in Maybell, Colorado. The refuge is approximately northwest of Maybell on State Highway 318. The refuge consists of bottomland and adjacent benchland. The western border of the refuge is the Colorado-Utah state line. The refuge is surrounded by adjacent lines of the Bureau of Land Management. The refuge contains the site of the former Fort Davy Crockett constructed in 1837 to protect trappers against attacks by Blackfoot Native Americans. ==Description== The acquisition of the refuge lands was approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission on August 20, 1963 in order to develop and manage waterfowl habitat in that portion of Browns Park within the state of Colorado. The private land was purchased with funds from the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act. The first tract of private land was acquired on July 13, 1965. As of 2005, have been purchased at a cost of $622,976, have been withdrawn from public domain lands, and are leased from the state of Colorado (state school sections). There is one private inholding on the refuge, a tract of grassland and cottonwood groves located at the southeast end of the refuge. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide high quality nesting and migration habitat for the Great Basin Canada goose, ducks and other migratory birds. Before the construction of Flaming Gorge Dam in 1962, the Green River flooded annually, creating excellent waterfowl nesting, feeding and resting marshes in the backwater sloughs and old stream meanders. The dam stopped the flooding, eliminating much of this waterfowl habitat. Pumping from the Green River, along with water diverted from Beaver and Vermillion Creeks, now maintains nine marsh units comprising approximately . The river covers approximately along with sedimentary river bottomlands. Well vegetated grasslands interspersed with cottonwood, willows, salt cedar, greasewood and sage cover approximately . The remainder of the refuge () is alluvial benchlands and steep rocky mountain slopes. Elevations vary from above sea level. The refuge is home to approximately 200 species of birds at various times of the year. Nesting birds in the refuge include mallards, redheads, teal, canvasbacks, other ducks, and Canada geese. About 300 goslings and 2,500 ducklings hatch annually. The waterfowl population swells by thousands during the spring and fall migrations. Bald eagles frequent the refuge during the winter. Golden eagles and peregrine falcons are seen soaring over the refuge during spring and summer. Bird watching is available at several locations in habitats ranging from semi-arid sage brush to lush wetlands and cottonwood stands adjacent to the Green River. The refuge is also home to mammal species such as deer, elk, pronghorn, and an occasional bighorn sheep, especially during moderate or severe winters. Moose are found in the wet, riparian areas during the spring, summer and fall. Deer and elk are commonly seen anywhere on the refuge during moderate to severe winters.

The supernova occurred approximately away within the Milky Way. The expanding cloud of material left over from the supernova now appears approximately across from Earth's perspective. In wavelengths of visible light, it has been seen with amateur telescopes down to 234 mm (9.25 in) with filters. It is estimated that light from the stellar explosion first reached Earth approximately 300 years ago, but there are no historical records of any sightings of the supernova that created the remnant. Since Cas A is circumpolar for mid-Northern latitudes, this is probably due to interstellar dust absorbing optical wavelength radiation before it reached Earth (although it is possible that it was recorded as a sixth magnitude star 3 Cassiopeiae by John Flamsteed on 16 August 1680). Possible explanations lean toward the idea that the source star was unusually massive and had previously ejected much of its outer layers. These outer layers would have cloaked the star and re- absorbed much of the light released as the inner star collapsed. Cas A was among the first discrete astronomical radio sources found. Its discovery was reported in 1948 by Martin Ryle and Francis Graham-Smith, astronomers at Cambridge, based on observations with the Long Michelson Interferometer. The optical component was first identified in 1950. Cas A is 3C461 in the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources and G111.7-2.1 in the Green Catalog of Supernova Remnants. == Earlier discovery== Calculations working back from the currently observed expansion point to an explosion that would have become visible on Earth around 1667. Astronomer William Ashworth and others have suggested that the Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed may have inadvertently observed the supernova on 16 August 1680, when he catalogued a star near its position. Another suggestion from recent cross-disciplinary research is that the supernova was the \\"noon day star\\", observed in 1630, that was thought to have heralded the birth of Charles II, the future monarch of Great Britain. At any rate, no supernova occurring within the Milky Way has been visible to the naked eye from Earth since. ==Expansion== The expansion shell has a temperature of around 30 million K, and is expanding at 4000‚àí6000 km/s. Observations of the exploded star through the Hubble telescope have shown that, despite the original belief that the remnants were expanding in a uniform manner, there are high velocity outlying eject knots moving with transverse velocities of 5,500‚àí14,500 km/s with the highest speeds occurring in two nearly opposing jets. When the view of the expanding star uses colors to differentiate materials of different chemical compositions, it shows that similar materials often remain gathered together in the remnants of the explosion. ==Radio source== Cas A had a flux density of at 1 GHz in 1980. Because the supernova remnant is cooling, its flux density is decreasing. At 1 GHz, its flux density is decreasing at a rate of per year. This decrease means that, at frequencies below 1 GHz, Cas A is now less intense than Cygnus A. Cas A is still the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky at frequencies above 1 GHz. ==X-ray source== In 1999, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory found CXOU J232327.8+584842, a \\"hot point-like source\\" close to the center of the nebula that is the neutron star remnant left by the explosion. Although Cas X-1 (or Cas XR-1), the apparent first X-ray source in the constellation Cassiopeia was not detected during the 16 June 1964, Aerobee sounding rocket flight, it was considered as a possible source. Cas A was scanned during another Aerobee rocket flight of 1 October 1964, but no significant X-ray flux above background was associated with the position. Cas XR-1 was discovered by an Aerobee rocket flight on 25 April 1965, at RA Dec . Cas X-1 is Cas A, a Type II SNR at RA Dec . The designations Cassiopeia X-1, Cas XR-1, Cas X-1 are no longer used, but the X-ray source is Cas A (SNR G111.7-02.1) at 2U 2321+58. ==Supernova reflected echo== Spitzer. The image was processed in a way that the infrared echo appears colored while dust clouds remain grey. In 2005 an infrared echo of the Cassiopeia A explosion was observed on nearby gas clouds using Spitzer Space Telescope. The infrared echo was also seen by IRAS and studied with the Infrared Spectrograph. Previously it was suspected that a flare in 1950 from a central pulsar could be responsible for the infrared echo. With the new data it was concluded that this is unlikely the case and that the infrared echo was caused by thermal emission by dust, which was heated by the radiative output of the supernova during the shock breakout. The infrared echo is accompanied by a scattered light echo. The recorded spectrum of the optical light echo proved the supernova was of Type IIb, meaning it resulted from the internal collapse and violent explosion of a massive star, most probably a red supergiant with a helium core which had lost almost all of its hydrogen envelope. This was the first observation of the light echo of a supernova whose explosion had not been directly observed which opens up the possibility of studying and reconstructing past astronomical events. In 2011 a study used spectra from different positions of the light echo to confirm that the Cassiopeia A supernova was asymmetric. == Phosphorus detection == In 2013, astronomers detected phosphorus in Cassiopeia A, which confirmed that this element is produced in supernovae through supernova nucleosynthesis. The phosphorus-to-iron ratio in material from the supernova remnant could be up to 100 times higher than in the Milky Way in general. ==Gallery== File:CassiopeiaA Supernova Remnant Nebula from the Mount Lemmon SkyCenter Schulman Telescope courtesy Adam Block.jpg|Cassiopeia A seen by the 24-inch Ritchey-Chr√©tien reflector at the Mount Lemmon Observatory Image:heic0609.jpg|Cassiopeia A observed by the Hubble Space Telescope File:HEAO-2 Image of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Taken by the High Energy Astronomy Observatory 8003547.jpg|x-ray image of Cassiopeia A taken with the Einstein Observatory File:Cassiopeia A First Light (Chandra).jpg|Cassiopeia A was the first light image of the Chandra X-ray Observatory File:Dust and Gas in Supernova Remnant.jpg|Cassiopeia A seen by Spitzer and showing different chemical elements and dust within the supernova remnant ==See also== * List of supernova remnants * Light echo ==References* Category:1947 in science 461 Category:Cassiopeia (constellation) Category:Milky Way Category:Supernova remnants 16800816 ?

It is an evergreen perennial flowering plant in the carnation family Caryophyllaceae. It is also called the compass plant, since the flowers appear first on the south side of the cushion. (Various other plants also have this name.) == Description == right Moss campion is a low, ground-hugging plant. It may seem densely matted and moss-like. The dense cushions are up to a foot or more in diameter. The plants are usually about 2\\" tall but may be as high as 6\\". The bright green leaves are narrow, arising from the base of the plant. The dead leaves from the previous season persist for years, and pink flowers are borne singly on short stalks that may be up to 1\\" long, but are usually much shorter. It usually has pink flowers, though very rarely they may be white. The flowers are solitary and star-shaped. They are between 6 and 12 mm wide, with hermaphrodite flowers being larger than the female ones. Female flowers produce better quality seeds than hermaphrodites and male flowers produce better quality pollen than hermaphrodites. The cushions can change the gender of their flowers between years. Gender frequencies change with altitude, the frequency of female flowers increasing with higher elevation. They usually appear in June through August.Nicholls, Graham, and Rick Lupp. Alpine Plants of North America: an Encyclopedia of Mountain Flowers from the Rockies to Alaska. Portland: Timber, 2002. The flowers are held by a calyx which is rather firm and thick.Zwinger, Ann, and Beatrice E. Willard. Land above the Trees: a Guide to American Alpine Tundra. Boulder, CO: Johnson, 1996. The flowers are female, male or hermaphrodites. The sepals are joined together into a tube that conceals the bases of the petals, which are entire. The 10 stamens and 3 styles extend well beyond the throat of the flower.Phillips, W (1999). Central Rocky Mountain Wildflowers: A Field Guide to Common Wildflowers, Shrubs, and Trees. Falcon Publishing, Inc. This genus, circumpolar in its distribution, is closely related to carnations. The stems and leaves are very sticky and viscid, which may discourage ants and beetles from climbing on the plant. The variety exscapa has shorter flowering stems. The other variety subacaulescens, from Wyoming and Colorado, has pale pink flowers all summer. ==Habitat== Alpine fellfield, on windswept rocky ridges and summits above treeline. It grows mainly in dry, gravelly localities, but also in damper places. With the cushions it produces its own, warmer climate with higher temperatures inside, when the sun shines.Benedict, Audrey D. The Naturalist's Guide to the Southern Rockies: Colorado, Southern Wyoming, and Northern New Mexico. Golden, CO: Fulcrum Pub., 2008. ==Distribution and range== USDA North American distribution of Silene acaulis (L.) Jacq. Common all over the high arctic and the higher mountains of Eurasia and North America, (south to the Alps, Carpathians, southern Siberia, Pyrenees, British Isles, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Rocky Mountains, ). In the United States it inhabits Colorado, the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming, the Wallowa Mountains of Oregon, the Olympics, the northern Cascades of Washington and Alaska.

Put the seedlings into separate pots, and it is recommended to let them winter in the greenhouse for their first winter season. To clean them rub the capsules through a screen. It's advised to plant them in the late spring or early summer because division takes place in the spring. They should be grown in well-drained soil with full sun. The climate can be cool. ==Endangerment information== In Maine it is possibly extirpated, and in New Hampshire Silene acaulis var. exscapa is threatened. ==History== Plants in Colorado have been estimated to reach 75 to 100 years in age, and Alaskan plants may reach 300 years. The oldest known Moss campion is 350 years old and has a diameter of two feet. The plant used to be used for children with colic. The raw root skin plants were consumed as a vegetable in Iceland and in Arctic regions. ==Climate warming impact== Experimental warming has been shown to start flowering substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming. Projections produced under different climate scenarios suggest that S. acaulis will likely face climate-driven fast decline in suitable areas on the British Isles and across North America, and that upward and northward shifts to occupy new climatically suitable areas are improbable in the future. ==Hazards/toxicity== There is no listing that moss campion is toxic, though it does have saponins which, though toxic, are hard to absorb in the body. They can be broken down by thorough cooking. Its advised to not consume large amounts of this plant. ==Gallery== Image:Silene acaulis - Mosscampion.jpg Image:Mosscampion6.jpg Image:Mosscampion5.jpg ==See also== *Flora of Svalbard ==References== *European Garden Flora, Vol. III. *\\"Silene Acaulis - (L.)Jacq.\\" Plants for a Future.

He wrote and directed more than twenty features, documentaries, and short films, which are known for his sharp insight into post-Revolutionary Cuba, and possess a delicate balance between dedication to the revolution and criticism of the social, economic, and political conditions of the country. Guti√©rrez's work is representative of a cinematic movement occurring in the 1960s and 1970s known collectively as the New Latin American Cinema. This collective movement, also referred to by various writers by specific names such as ‚ÄúThird Cinema‚Äù, ‚ÄúCine Libre‚Äù, and ‚ÄúImperfect Cinema,‚Äù was concerned largely with the problems of neocolonialism and cultural identity. The movement rejected both the commercial perfection of the Hollywood style, and the auteur-oriented European art cinema, for a cinema created as a tool for political and social change. Due not in a small part to the filmmakers‚Äô lack of resources, aesthetic was of secondary importance to cinema's social function. The movement's main goal was to create films in which the viewer became an active, self-aware participant in the discourse of the film. Viewers were presented with an analysis of a current problem within society that as of that time had no clear solution, hoping to make the audience aware of the problem and to leave the theater willing to become actors of social change. ==Early life== Born in Havana on December 11, 1928, Guti√©rrez was raised in an affluent, politically progressive family. After receiving his law degree from the University of Havana in 1951, Guti√©rrez studied cinema at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, graduating in 1953. He was heavily influenced by Italian Neorealism, and created his first films in Rome with future Cuban colleague Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa, with whom he co-directed the documentary film El M√©gano (The Charcoal Worker). Shortly after the success of the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro in 1959, Guti√©rrez, Espinosa, and several other young filmmakers founded the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos (ICAIC). As ardent supporters of the Revolution, ICAIC was a filmmaker's collective which believed film to be the most important modern art form and the best medium to distribute revolutionary thought to the masses. Guti√©rrez's Esta Tierra Nuestra (This Land Of Ours), was the first documentary made after the revolutionary victory. ICAIC focused mostly on documentaries and newsreels in its formative years, but eventually expanded into production of feature films, including Guti√©rrez's early Historias de la Revoluci√≥n (Stories Of The Revolution) (1960), ICAIC's first fiction film, and Doce sillas (The Twelve Chairs), (1962). Stories of the Revolution was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival and The Twelve Chairs was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. ==Most popular works== Guti√©rrez's first widely successful feature, Muerte de un bur√≥crata (Death of a Bureaucrat) (1966) introduces itself as a sort of homage to the history of cinematic comedy, and includes direct allusions to the work of Buster Keaton, Laurel & Hardy, Luis Bu√±uel, and many others. The story follows a young man's confounding plight through bureaucratic offices to have his dead uncle exhumed and then reburied after the body is buried with his identification card. His next film, Memorias del Subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment) (1968) was the first Cuban film to be shown in the United States since the Revolution. Based on Edmundo Desnoes‚Äôs novella \\"Inconsolable Memories,\\" the film is the memoir of a morally ambiguous bourgeois intellectual living in Havana in the period between the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The protagonist is unwilling to take a political stance one way or another, yet continues to despise the country around him for being backwards and underdeveloped. His life eventually fades into nothingness, becoming a personality which has no use in this new Cuba. In a self-reflexive cameo appearance, Guti√©rrez calls the film a ‚Äúcollage‚Ä¶with a little bit of everything‚Äù. Guti√©rrez uses a dizzying array of materials and filmic styles in Memories, from documentary-style narrative sequences which use long unbroken shots taken from handheld cameras to agitational montage sequences reminiscent of the films of early Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein. Memories makes use of various types of media including direct documentary footage shot, still photos, archive and newsreel footage, clips of Hollywood films, and recorded speeches by Fidel Castro and John F. Kennedy, to create a seemingly disarticulated film language that is in direct contrast to the straightforward Hollywood style. Although criticism of the Revolution and Cuban society was at the heart of not only Memories, but all of Guti√©rrez's works, Guti√©rrez continued to be a dedicated supporter of Cuban Socialism. But his works could hardly be described as propaganda either. Guti√©rrez described the motivation for his contradictory approach by saying: ‚Äú‚Ä¶cinema provides an active and mobilizing element, which stimulates participation in the revolutionary process. Then, it is not sufficient to have a moralizing cinema based on harangue and exhortation. We need a cinema that promotes and develops a critical attitude. But how to criticize and at the same time strengthen the reality in which we are immersed?‚Äù Commenting on his style, Guti√©rrez called himself \\"a man who makes criticism inside the revolution, who wants to ameliorate the process, to perfect it, but not to destroy it\\". ==Late career and legacy== In the following decades, Guti√©rrez divided his time between making his own films and mentoring promising young filmmakers through ICAIC. In 1972 and 1976, respectively, Guti√©rrez completed two historical feature films, Una pelea cubana contra los demonios (A Cuban Fight Against the Demons) and La √∫ltima cena (The Last Supper). Both set in Spanish colonial Cuba, the films study contradictions and hypocrisy in Cuba's past of imperialism, religion, and slavery. Hasta cierto punto (Up to a Certain Point) (ez's wife, Mirta Ibarra.) The film underwent some censorship and remains to this day considered by Cuban critics one of his lesser works, though it is still highly regarded. The director himself said jokingly that the film was only successful \\"up to a certain point\\" In the early 1990s, Guti√©rrez fell into ill health, forcing him to co-direct his last two films with his friend Juan Carlos Tab√≠o. The first, Fresa y Chocolate (Strawberry and Chocolate) (1993) became the first Cuban film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. The film's story centers on the oft conflictory relationship between a committed Marxist student and a flamboyantly gay artist. Guti√©rrez's final film, Guantanamera, (1994) uses traditional elements such as an ensemble cast and romantic comedy to take a more subtle approach to Guti√©rrez's old targets: underdevelopment and bureaucracy. The film won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. Tit√≥n, as he was known to his friends, died in Havana on April 16, 1996, at age 67. He is buried in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. Three of Guti√©rrez's films‚ÄîDeath of a Bureaucrat, Una Pelea Cubana contra los Demonios, and Los Sobrevivientes‚Äîwere preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017 and 2019. ==Filmography== *La caperucita roja (1947) - short film *El faquir (1947) - short film *Una confusi√≥n cotidiana (1950) - short film, codirected with Nestor Almendros and based upon \\"A Common Confusion\\" by Franz Kafka *Il sogno de Giovanni Bassain (1953) - short film, codirected with Filippo Perrone *El m√©gano (1955) - short documentary film, codirected with Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa and made in collaboration with Alfredo Guevara, Jos√© Massip *La toma de La Habana por los ingleses (1958) - short documentary film *Esta tierra nuestra (1959) - short documentary film, codirected with Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa *Stories of the Revolution (Historias de la revoluci√≥n) (1960) - Fiction, 81 minutes *General Assembly (Asamblea general) (1960) - short documentary film *Death to the Invader (Muerte al invasor) (1961) - short documentary film, codirected with Santiago √Ålvarez *The Twelve Chairs (Las doce sillas) (1962) - Fiction, 97 minutes *Cumbite (1964) - Fiction, 82 minutes *Death of a Bureaucrat (Muerte de un bur√≥crata) (1966) - Fiction, 85 minutes *Memories of Underdevelopment (Memorias del Subdesarrollo) (1968) - Fiction, 97 minutes *A Cuban Fight Against Demons (Una pelea cubana contra los demonios) (1971) - Fiction, 130 minutes *El arte del tabaco (1974) - short documentary film *El camino de la mirra y el incienso (1975) - short documentary film, codirected by Constante Diego *The Last Supper (La √∫ltima cena) (1976) - Fiction, 120 minutes *La sexta parte del mundo (1977) - documentary film, codirected with Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa *The Survivors (Los sobrevivientes) (1979) - Fiction, 130 minutes *Up to a Certain Point (Hasta cierto punto) (1983) - Fiction, 88 minutes *Letters from the Park (Cartas del parque) (1989) - Fiction, 88 minutes *Far Apart (Contigo en la distancia) (1991) - segment of the anthology film Con el amor no se juega *Fresa y Chocolate (1993) - codirected with Juan Carlos Tab√≠o, Fiction, 110 minutes *Guantanamera (1995) - codirected with Juan Carlos Tab√≠o, Fiction, 101 minutes ==See also== *Cinema of Cuba ==References== ==External links== *Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea p√°gina oficial (Spanish) * Category:Cuban film directors Category:1928 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia alumni ","title":"Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea"},{"id":"1996924","text":"The Crown of Napoleon, called by him the \\"Crown of Charlemagne\\". The Crown of Napoleon was a coronation crown manufactured for Napoleon and used in his coronation as Emperor of the French on December 2, 1804. Napoleon called this crown the \\"Crown of Charlemagne\\", which was the name of the ancient royal coronation crown of France that had been destroyed during the French Revolution. This name allowed Napoleon to compare himself to the famed mediaeval monarch Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor. ==Origins== The Coronation of Napoleon, memorialised by Jacques-Louis David. The French Revolution of the 1790s had led to the destruction of most of the ancient French Crown Jewels, along with the eventual abolition of the French monarchy and the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. When Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French a decade later, he decided to create new imperial regalia, the centerpiece of which was his \\"Charlemagne crown\\". ==Usage== Napoleon on his Imperial throne (wearing his laurel leaf crown). painting by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres in 1806. In the coronation itself, which took place not in the traditional location of French royal coronations, the Cathedral in Reims, but in Notre Dame in Paris, he actually used two crowns. Initially, he placed a laurel crown of the Roman emperors on his own head. Afterward, he briefly placed the imperial Charlemagne crown on his head, then touched it to the head of his empress, Josephine. ==Design== As was the norm with European crowns, Napoleon's crown is made up of eight half-arches. They are set with shell cameos and carved carnelians which meet at a golden globe, on top of which is placed a cross. The crown itself is mock mediaeval in style, reliant totally on gold and metallic decoration and devoid of the major covering with diamonds and jewels fashionable in crowns made later in the 19th century. ==After the First Empire== The Crown of Napoleon was used until his second overthrow in 1815. King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI, was installed on the throne as King of France following Napoleon's overthrow. In contrast both to his brother and to Napoleon, the new king opted not to have a coronation. When his brother, Charles X became king in 1824, he reinstated the traditional monarchical coronation in Reims and was crowned using the remaining pre-revolutionary French royal crown, the Crown of Louis XV. No more French coronations, either imperial or royal, followed Charles X's overthrow in 1830. When Napoleon III proclaimed himself French emperor in 1852, he opted to neither have a coronation nor wear Napoleon I's crown. Nevertheless, two crowns was created for himself, the Crown of Napoleon III, and for Empress Eug√©nie, the Crown of Empress Eug√©nie. ==Sale of the French Crown Jewels== In 1885, to impede any further attempts at royal or imperial restorations, the French National Assembly opted to sell most of the French Crown Jewels. Only a handful of crowns were kept for historic reasons, and they had their precious jewels replaced in them by decorated glass. Napoleon I's crown was one of the few kept. It is now on display in the Louvre museum in Paris. Napoleon Category:19th century in France !

It is an electoral ward of Hertford. ==Toponym== River Beane towards Molewood Taken from Beane Road Bengeo is on a rise between the River Beane and River Rib overlooking Hartham Common. Its toponym is derived from an Old English name meaning spur or ridge over the River Beane. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Belingehou. It evolved through forms including Beneggho and Beningho in the 13th century, Bengeho in the 15th century and Benjow in the 16th century before reaching its current form. ==Geography and amenities== The Avenue Other than the south east corner which adjoins Hertford, Bengeo is mostly surrounded by countryside. Informally (the terms having no official status) Bengeo consists of Upper and Lower Bengeo; Upper Bengeo is the area at the top of Port Hill leading out of Hertford town centre, while Lower Bengeo is the area on the side of the hill and centred on Byde Street. On an approximate north-south trajectory Bengeo is bisected by the B158, known as Port Hill as it leaves Hertford and climbs the hill to Upper Bengeo and then as Bengeo Street as it continues through, and then out of, Bengeo to the north. Leaving Port Hill to the east runs The Warren, an ancient footpath along the edge of the River Beane and Hartham Common leading to the ancient church of St Leonard.

It was the parish church of Bengeo until 1855, when it was succeeded by the new Holy Trinity parish church designed by Benjamin Ferrey. St. Leonard's is still used for regular Sunday services in summer months, as well as hosting exhibitions and concerts. Close to St Leonard's Church along St Leonard's Road are three of Hertford's oldest houses, Revels Hall, built in the mid sixteenth century, Bengeo Old House, formerly the vicarage, built in the late sixteenth century and Bengeo Hall, built in the late seventeenth century and home to landscape painter Joshua Gosselin. All are Grade II* listed buildings. On the west side of Bengeo are two further Grade II listed buildings, The Old Pest House and Little Molewood. The former, on the corner of Byde Street and Fanshawe Street, was built in 1763 as a smallpox isolation hospital; the latter, situated on The Avenue, is an arts and crafts style house, built in 1904 for the Graveson family of Hertford by the architects Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, who were the architects and planners of Letchworth Garden City. The prominent concrete water tower on The Drive was built in 1929 and opened in 1930 to boost the water supply to new housing which could no longer be adequately accommodated by the then (but no longer) existing pumping station and water tower on Tower Street.

It is used in situations where several PCs are used together, with a monitor connected to each, but are to be controlled by one user. The user needs only one keyboard and mouse on the desk -- similar to a KVM switch without the video. Partly open source and partly closed source, the open source components are released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, which is free software. The first version of Synergy was created on May 13, 2001, by Chris Schoeneman and worked with the X Window System only. Synergy now supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems. == Design == Once the program is installed, users can move the mouse \\"off\\" the side of their desktop on one computer, and the mouse pointer will appear on the desktop of another computer. Key presses will be delivered to whichever computer the mouse-pointer is located in. This makes it possible to control several machines as easily as if they were a single multi-monitor computer. The clipboard and even screensavers can be synchronized. The program is implemented as a server which defines which screen-edges lead to which machines, and one or more clients, which connect to the server to offer the use of their desktops. The keyboard and mouse are connected to the server machine. As of version 2.0 (2017) keystrokes, mouse movements and clipboard contents are sent via an encrypted SSL network connection. This previously required the purchase of the Pro edition in version 1. In July 2013 the Defuse Security Group reported the proprietary encryption used in Synergy 1.6 to be insecure and released an exploit which could be used to passively decrypt the commands sent to the Synergy 1.6 clients. This was solved by using SSL in 1.7. TCP/IP communications (default port 24800) are used to send mouse, keyboard and clipboard events between computers in Synergy 1. ==History== The first incarnation of Synergy was CosmoSynergy, created by Richard Lee and Adam Feder then at Cosmo Software, Inc., a subsidiary of SGI (n√©e Silicon Graphics, Inc.), at the end of 1996. They wrote it, and Chris Schoeneman contributed, to solve a problem: most of the engineers in Cosmo Software had both an Irix and a Windows box on their desks and switchboxes were expensive and annoying. CosmoSynergy was a great success but Cosmo Software declined to productize it and the company was later closed. Synergy is a from-scratch reimplementation of CosmoSynergy. It provides most of the features of the original and adds a few improvements. Synergy+ was created in 2009 as a maintenance fork for the purpose of fixing bugs inherited from the original version. The original version of Synergy had not been updated for a notable length of time (as of 6 June 2010, the latest release was 2 April 2006). There was never official confirmation that the original Synergy project had been abandoned; however, there was public discussion providing speculation. In said discussion, Chris Schoeneman (the creator of Synergy) stated that instead of supporting a 1.3.x team, he intends on releasing version 2.0 of Synergy, and publicly announced on 27 Aug 2008 that he has been making progress on this version. ==See also== * Multiseat configuration (the inverse of Synergy) * x2x also allows the keyboard and mouse to be shared between machines, using OpenSSH tunneling * QuickSynergy * Barrier, an open-source fork of the Synergy 1.9 code base ==References== == External links == * * Free Synergy 1 downloads * - Official source code * - User-maintained fork of Synergy 1.9 Category:Free software programmed in C++ Category:Free system software Category:Remote desktop Category:Utilities for macOS Category:Utilities for Windows Category:Utilities for Linux Category:Linux network-related software Category:Virtual Network Computing Category:Keyboard-sharing software Category:Remote desktop software for Linux ","title":"Synergy (software)"},{"id":"1996948","text":"Clifton K.

Horton played for Hednesford Town, Port Vale, Brighton & Hove Albion, Luton Town and Hull City as a midfielder. His most significant spells were with Port Vale and Brighton from 1970 to 1981, making over 200 appearances over the course of around five seasons with each club. He also made over 100 appearances for Luton between 1981 and 1984. He was promoted out of the Second Division with both Brighton and Luton. During his career he was named on the PFA Team of the Year three times, and played a total of 610 league games in the English Football League. He was even more prolific as a manager, taking the reins at Hull City, Oxford United, Manchester City, Huddersfield Town, Brighton & Hove Albion, Port Vale and Macclesfield Town. His longest spells were at Hull and Vale, where he had previously found success as a player. At all seven clubs he boasted a win ratio of more than 30%. Horton is one of the few managers in English football to have taken charge of teams in more than a thousand games. His successes include taking Hull out of the Third Division in 1984‚Äì85, and winning the League Trophy with Port Vale in 2001. However his speciality has been in stabilising struggling clubs, as he has been relegated only twice in more than 20 seasons as a manager. ==Playing career== ===Hednesford Town=== Born in Hednesford, Staffordshire, Horton was a tough defensive midfielder who started his career as a member of Walsall's youth team at the age of 15. He played regularly in the West Midlands (Regional) League, though was released after two years without having appeared for the first team, and dropped down to his non-League hometown club Hednesford Town after being signed by player-manager Dick Neal. Known as Nobby to fans, a nickname that stuck with him throughout his career, he won the Staffordshire Senior Cup in his final appearance for the club. ===Port Vale=== He signed for Third Division Port Vale in July 1970. It was reported that his transfer fee was a pint of shandy, as the cash-strapped potteries club haggled with the Hednesford Town chairman by plying him with alcohol, therefore his transfer fee was 'a pint of shandy'. A first team regular from the start under manager Gordon Lee, Horton played 40 games in 1970‚Äì71, and scored his first competitive goal in a 3‚Äì2 win against Bury at Gigg Lane. He then found his scoring form in 1971‚Äì72, as he hit eight goals in 47 appearances; he also became the club's penalty taker, with half of his goals coming from the spot. He hit seven goals in 43 games in 1972‚Äì73, four of his strikes coming from the penalty spot. He missed a period around Christmas due to injury, and during this time his teammates struggled to find results; this ultimately cost the \\"Valiants\\", as they finished four points behind promoted Notts County. Lee changed the team's formation from 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 to 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 in 1973‚Äì74, hoping that this would allow Horton more room in the centre of the field. However Vale's form suffered, and Lee was replaced as manager by Roy Sproson in January. Vale finished the campaign one place above the relegation zone, though were seven points clear of danger. Horton played 46 games, scoring four goals. Vale missed out on promotion by just four points in 1974‚Äì75, as Horton hit thirteen goals in 47 games, leaving him one goal behind top-scorers Ray Williams and Terry Bailey. He hit four goals in 35 games in 1975‚Äì76, as he bagged both of Vale's goals in a win over Millwall at Vale Park. Much to the disappointment of Vale supporters, he was sold to league rivals Brighton & Hove Albion in March 1976 for a fee of ¬£30,000. In total he spent nearly six years with Port Vale, scoring a total of 37 goals in 258 games in league and cup competitions. ===Brighton & Hove Albion=== Brighton finished fourth in 1975‚Äì76, three points shy of promotion, and Peter Taylor departed. For his performances at both Vale and Brighton, Horton was named on the PFA Team of the Year, along with Brighton teammates Graham Cross and Peter Ward. The \\"Seagulls\\" finished second in 1976‚Äì77 under Alan Mullery, and thus were promoted into the Second Division. They then stormed to a fourth-place finish in 1977‚Äì78, missing out on promotion to the First Division only because Tottenham Hotspur had superior goal difference. Undeterred, Brighton won promotion as runners-up in 1978‚Äì79, one point behind champions Crystal Palace and one point ahead of fourth place Sunderland. Horton was named on the PFA Team of the Year for a second time, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson. In 1979‚Äì80, Brighton played top-flight football for the first time in their history. They finished a respectable sixteenth, some six points clear of the drop. The 1980‚Äì81 season was a much narrower affair, but Brighton finished nineteenth, two points clear of relegated Norwich City. He left the Goldstone Ground having scored 47 goals in 251 league and cup games. ===Luton Town=== Horton transferred to Luton Town in August 1981, as the club were competing in the Second Division under the stewardship of David Pleat. He was again promoted into the top-flight, as the \\"Hatters\\" topped the Second Division table in 1981‚Äì82 by an eight-point margin, some eighteen points clear of fourth place Sheffield Wednesday. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career, alongside teammates Kirk Stephens, Ricky Hill, and David Moss. Luton then went on to escape relegation on the final day of the 1982‚Äì83 season at Maine Road, following a 1‚Äì0 over Manchester City, who took their place in the relegation zone. The match became famous for the images of David Pleat dancing across the pitch in jubilation. He left Kenilworth Road at the conclusion of the 1983‚Äì84 campaign, as the club secured their top-flight status with a sixteenth-place finish. He had played 131 first team games for the club, scoring 14 goals. His next move was to Hull City, who appointed him their player-manager, and with whom he ended his playing career in 1986 after making 46 competitive appearances. ==Managerial career== ===Hull City=== Horton became player-manager of Hull City in July 1984, and led his side to promotion to the Second Division in 1984‚Äì85. He quickly built up a reputation as a \\"strong-minded, tactically-aware coach.\\" He signed former Luton Town teammate Frankie Bunn as a replacement for top-scorer Billy Whitehurst, who he sold to Newcastle United. The following season they came very close to earning promotion to the First Division, finishing a credible sixth place. At the end of the campaign Horton quit playing to concentrate on full-time management. Despite the introduction of the play-off system in 1986‚Äì87, the \\"Tigers\\" ended the campaign in mid-table obscurity. The 1987‚Äì88 campaign began promisingly, and the club was in the top six and chasing the automatic promotion places by the half-way stage. However, a dreadful run of results in which there was just one win in seventeen games ended any hope of promotion. Their form was not helped by the sale of star play-maker Garry Parker to Nottingham Forest for a ¬£260,000 fee. After a 4‚Äì1 home defeat to Swindon Town, chairman Don Robinson was furious and immediately fired Horton. The players took responsibility for the defeat and urged the chairman to re- consider, Robinson obliged, but Horton refused the offer of reinstatement. During his reign he turned down the opportunity to sign apprentice Dean Windass. Hull went on to finish the season in fifteenth place, as Eddie Gray was announced as his successor. ===Oxford United=== Horton's next move was to become assistant to rookie manager Mark Lawrenson at Oxford United. Lawrenson left the club in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. In February 1989, he bought John Durnin from Liverpool for a ¬£250,000 fee. He also gave d√©buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988‚Äì89 Second Division campaign in seventeenth place. In preparation for 1989‚Äì90, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for ¬£175,000; he also brought Ceri Evans and Steve Foster to the club. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in seventeenth place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990‚Äì91 campaign, he paid Swansea City ¬£275,000 for Andy Melville and bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for ¬£150,000. He also signed young Liverpool midfielder Jim Magilton. The \\"Yellows\\" finished in tenth place, eight points off the play-off places. The club faced a financial crisis following the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell, and over the summer Horton was forced to sell striker Martin Foyle to Port Vale for ¬£375,000. He made no major signings in Foyle's place, and instead handed d√©buts to Paul Wanless, Chris Allen, and Bobby Ford. He also sold Paul Simpson to Derby for ¬£500,000 in February 1992. The loss of close to ¬£1 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford finished 1991‚Äì92 one place and two points ahead of relegated Plymouth Argyle. They secured their safety with a final day win over Tranmere Rovers. There was less drama in 1992‚Äì93, as his side finished fourteenth, seven points above the drop. Over the summer he paid Corby Town ¬£20,000 for striker Matt Murphy, and sold Andy Melville on to Sunderland for ¬£500,000. Horton left the Manor Ground for an even bigger challenge in August 1993. Oxford went on to suffer relegation at the end of the 1993‚Äì94 campaign, under the stewardship of Denis Smith. ===Manchester City=== In August 1993, four games after the start of the 1993‚Äì94 Premier League campaign, Horton resigned as Oxford manager to replace Peter Reid as manager of Manchester City ‚Äì to the surprise of many supporters and commentators, who were expecting the appointment of someone more high-profile. City's previous three seasons in the top flight had yielded top-ten finishes but Horton struggled with injuries ‚Äì key striker Niall Quinn was missing through a cruciate ligament injury ‚Äì and City were 20th and bottom in mid- February. He traded eight-year club veteran striker David White to Leeds United in exchange for David Rocastle; Rocastle failed to live up to expectations, and scored just two league goals. But then Horton transformed his attack by signing Uwe R√∂sler, Paul Walsh and Peter Beagrie, and City escaped relegation after losing only two of the last fourteen games of the season. Horton played with two out and out wingers in 1994‚Äì95, Beagrie and summer signing Nicky Summerbee. This led to R√∂sler, Walsh and Quinn scoring 47 goals between them, but also to some heavy defeats, such as the 5‚Äì0 loss to rivals Manchester United. City were sixth on 3 December and there was talk of a much-awaited return to European football, as young talents such as Garry Flitcroft, Richard Edghill, and Steve Lomas came to the fore. However they won only four of their remaining 25 league games, finishing just four points clear of relegation, and Horton was sacked. His sacking was predicted by many, as Francis Lee had taken over as chairman after Horton's appointment, and wished to have his 'own man' in the dugout at Maine Road. City went on to suffer relegation in 1995‚Äì96 under Alan Ball. ===Huddersfield Town=== He made a swift return to management with Huddersfield Town, who had just won promotion to the First Division under Neil Warnock, who announced his surprise resignation days after the club's play-off success. The \\"Terriers\\" started 1995‚Äì96 positively, and enjoyed a mid-season run of just two defeats in nineteen games. They also reached the Fifth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Premier League Wimbledon in a replay at Plough Lane. A play-off place beckoned, but a run of just three wins in their final thirteen games left them in eighth place, eight points behind sixth placed Charlton Athletic. Horton broke the club's transfer record when he splashed out ¬£1.2 million on Bristol Rovers striker Marcus Stewart. However Huddersfield failed to impress in 1996‚Äì97, and ended the campaign just two places and eight points ahead of relegated Grimsby Town. Huddersfield had suffered as both Stewart and defender Andy Morrison missed much of the campaign due to injury, though ¬£325,000 summer signing Andy Payton proved to be a revelation, hitting nineteen goals in league and cup. The club bottom of the table, Horton was sacked in September 1997, two years before the end of his contract, after his side went nine league games without a win. The \\"Terriers\\" went on to finish 1997‚Äì98 in sixteenth place under Peter Jackson. ===Brighton & Hove Albion=== In February 1998, Horton returned to one of his old clubs as a player when he became manager of Brighton & Hove Albion. The club were second from bottom in the Third Division and would have been facing the prospect of Conference football were bottom club Doncaster Rovers not so far behind the rest of the pack. He led the club to victory over Chester City, Brighton's first win in five months. The \\"Seagulls\\" secured their Football League status in April after winning a point at league leaders Notts County. They went on to finish 1997‚Äì98 second from bottom, fifteen points clear of relegated Doncaster, yet six points behind third from bottom Hull City, who were themselves nine points behind Swansea and Cardiff in 20th and 21st. He then signed Gary Hart from Stansted of the Essex Senior Football League for ¬£1,000 and a set of kit. Brighton improved under Horton in 1998‚Äì99, though Horton left the club in January 1999 to take charge of another of his old clubs, Port Vale, after the sacking of long-serving manager John Rudge. Brighton went on to finish the season in seventeenth place under Micky Adams. ===Port Vale=== In order to help the Vale to avoid relegation in 1999, Horton brought in Dave Brammer, Tony Butler, Carl Griffiths, Alex Smith, and Chris Allen. This spending spree set the club back ¬£590,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for ¬£250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings. He also brought in two loanees: Alan Lee from Aston Villa, and Craig Russell from Manchester City. A five-game unbeaten run in April allowed the Vale to finish above relegated Bury on goals scored. In a bid to survive another season in the First Division, Horton allowed ten players to leave Vale Park; the most significant departure was Neil Aspin, as the 34 year dropped down two divisions as his career wound down. To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: Jeff Minton from former club Brighton, Tommy Widdrington from Grimsby Town, and Steve Rimmer from Manchester City. He also took goalkeepers Andy Oakes and Matt Glennon in on loan, and signed striker Martin Aldridge on loan from Blackpool. As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for ¬£100,000. He further sold Anthony Gardner to Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£1 million, and sold Tony Butler to West Bromwich Albion for ¬£140,000. In their place he signed Micky Cummins, Mark Goodlad, Sagi Burton, and Ville Viljanen; and also took Martin Bullock, Gareth Taylor, and David Healy in on loan. His side finished second from bottom were relegated in his first full season as manager. At the end of the campaign club legend Martin Foyle retired, whilst key players Paul Musselwhite and Ian Bogie also departed. In preparation for life in the Second Division, Horton signed Sincliar Le Geyt, Dean Delany, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson, and Michael Twiss. He supplemented these free transfer signings with loanees David Freeman and David Beresford. Horton came under pressure from the board at the start of the 2000‚Äì01 campaign, as his team went thirteen games without a win, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Canvey Island. He responded to this humiliation by placing five players on the transfer list. He signed Steve Brooker for ¬£15,000; brought in Onandi Lowe and Richard Burgess on free transfers; signed Wayne Gray and Ashley Dodd on loan; whilst also offloading Jeff Minton to Rotherham United. Vale's form improved, as they avoided defeat in both Potteries derby games. Horton was named Manager of the Month in March, after a good run of results ended fears of a second successive relegation. He also won his first trophy as a manager as Vale lifted the League Trophy, coming from behind to beat Brentford at the Millennium Stadium. Vale also won the Staffordshire Senior Cup. However more club legends departed, as Tony Naylor and Allen Tankard began to show their age. More controversial was the sale of Dave Brammer to Crewe Alexandra for ¬£500,000. The club entered a financial crisis following the collapse of ITV Digital, which cost the club ¬£400,000 in revenue. This meant Horton had to build his squad for 2001‚Äì02 entirely on free transfers. Ashley Dodd, Ian Armstrong, Phil Hardy, Rae Ingram, Alex Gibson, Chris Killen, Simon Osborn, Sean McClare, Danny Webber, John Durnin, and Mvondo Atangana all would make little impact; however former Coventry City striker Stephen McPhee would be a key player for the club over the next few years. Vale beat rivals Stoke City, but ended 2001‚Äì02 in mid- table obscurity. Manager of the Month in February, Horton was linked to vacant management position at Preston North End, but remained at Vale Park. Horton signed Jon McCarthy, Brett Angell, Ian Brightwell, Phil Charnock, Sam Collins, and Mark Boyd for the 2002‚Äì03 campaign. Four straight defeats were followed by five consecutive victories, as he supplemented his squad with the additions of Lee Ashcroft, Peter Clarke and Adrian Littlejohn. Though relegation was avoided, Horton still remained unpopular with some sections of the Vale's supporters. However the season was dominated by off-the-field issues, as Vale entered administration, and were taken over by Bill Bratt's fan-based consortium. Building for the 2003‚Äì04 campaign, Horton had to find a replacement for departing defender Matt Carragher. He found his replacement in Everton's reliable young George Pilkington; he also signed goalkeeper Jonny Brain and Austrian defender Andreas Lipa. By the start of the campaign Horton had completed the rebuilding of his squad that was necessitated by the financial crisis and the ageing of the highly successful side of the mid-1990s. A good start saw the club top of the table and Horton was named as Manager of the Month. The Vale were one point outside the play-offs by February, at which point Horton tendered his resignation. In his absence, rookie manager Martin Foyle led the club to a seventh-place finish, as the \\"Valiants\\" missed out on the play-offs due to their inferior goal difference. ===Macclesfield Town=== Linked with the management position at Swansea City, Horton was instead appointed as manager of Third Division strugglers Macclesfield Town at the start of April 2004, replacing John Askey. This was initially until the end of the season, but in May he was given the job on a permanent basis. He rejuvenated a demoralised side and kept them in the Football League, as they finished seven points clear of the drop in 2003‚Äì04. Over the summer he signed Iraqi international Jassim Swadi, experienced striker Mike Sheron, veteran defender Tony Barras, left-back Mark Bailey, and Tommy Rooney (cousin of Wayne Rooney). He allowed Martin Carruthers to leave, though extended Tommy Widdrington's contract, and offered fresh deals to six others. He later added to his squad by signing Mark Boyd and Simon Weaver; whilst transfer listing Tommy Widdrington and Michael Welch. Many pundits were tipping the \\"Silkmen\\" to slip out of the newly named League Two at the end of 2004‚Äì05, but Horton proved the observers wrong as his side were in the top- seven of the division virtually all season long. Horton celebrated his 1000th game as a manager on 3 November 2004, as Macclesfield beat Mansfield 4‚Äì0 in the League Trophy. He also won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February. Macclesfield qualified for the play-offs in sixth place, but their promotion challenge was finally ended by Lincoln City in the semi-finals, following a 2‚Äì1 aggregate defeat. At the end of the season, Horton released nine players, including club captain Matthew Tipton. In the place of these nine players he signed Kevin Sandwith, Kevin Townson, Martin Bullock, and David Beresford. Despite high expectations, Horton's men were not to challenge again in 2005‚Äì06. The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling ¬£250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \\"serious misconduct\\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and non-league striker Matty McNeil. The \\"Silkmen\\" finished in seventeenth place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006‚Äì07 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League. Paul Ince was appointed as his replacement, and led the club to a 22nd-place finish, as they avoided relegation by two points, after Boston United were hit with a ten-point deduction. ===Assistant at Hull and Preston=== In May 2007, Horton returned to Hull City as assistant manager to Phil Brown; this appointment came nineteen years after he resigned as Hull manager. He helped the club win promotion to the Premier League via the play- offs in May 2008, the first time Hull City were in the top-flight in 104 years. In October 2008, Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson praised Horton for his part in Hull's superb start to the 2008‚Äì09 Premier League season, though their early challenge among the top six clubs did not last and they ended the season just one place above the relegation zone. In March 2009, Horton was featured heavily in the press after accusing Arsenal club captain Cesc F√†bregas of spitting following an encounter in the FA Cup. F√†bregas was later cleared of any wrongdoing. The \\"Tigers\\" struggled in 2009‚Äì10, and Phil Brown was put on gardening leave on 15 March, as Horton and Steve Parkin were appointed as the club's joint-caretaker managers. Hull went on to be relegated under Iain Dowie, who had made Tim Flowers his assistant. In January 2011, Phil Brown was appointed manager of Preston North End, and Horton was appointed as his assistant. Preston were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 campaign. Horton left Preston when Phil Brown was sacked on 14 December 2011. ===Return to Macclesfield Town=== In March 2012, following the departure of Gary Simpson, Horton returned to Macclesfield Town as manager for the rest of the 2011‚Äì12 season. Assisted by Glyn Chamberlain, he had been tasked with steering the club clear of relegation from League Two, much the same task as he faced the first time he was appointed manager at Moss Rose. A 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Burton Albion on 28 April sent the \\"Silkmen\\" into the Conference after 15 years in the Football League. He stepped down as manager on 30 April, having gained just two points from his eight games in charge. ===Later career=== In June 2013, he was appointed as assistant manager to Paul Dickov at Championship club Doncaster Rovers. He left the role in July 2015. He was appointed as football coordinator by Southend United manager Phil Brown in August 2015. He left Roots Hall on 17 January 2018 after Brown was placed on gardening leave. On 15 March 2018, Brown appointed Horton as his assistant at new club Swindon Town. However he left the club just two months later, ending the pair's eleven year partnership in management. ==Career statistics== ===Playing statistics=== Source: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"|Division !colspan=\\"2\\"|League !colspan=\\"2\\"|FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"|Other !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\\"7\\"|Port Vale |1970‚Äì71 |Third Division |39||1||1||0||0||0||40||1 |- |1971‚Äì72 |Third Division |42||5||4||3||1||0||47||8 |- |1972‚Äì73 |Third Division |39||6||4||2||2||0||45||8 |- |1973‚Äì74 |Third Division |41||4||4||0||1||0||46||4 |- |1974‚Äì75 |Third Division |44||13||2||0||1||0||47||13 |- |1975‚Äì76 |Third Division |31||4||3||0||1||0||35||4 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !236!!33!!16!!4!!6!!0!!262!!37 |- |rowspan=\\"7\\"|Brighton & Hove Albion |1975‚Äì76 |Third Division |11||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |1976‚Äì77 |Third Division |45||9||3||0||6||3||54||12 |- |1977‚Äì78 |Second Division |42||8||2||1||6||1||50||10 |- |1978‚Äì79 |Second Division |40||11||1||0||4||0||45||11 |- |1979‚Äì80 |First Division |42||4||1||2||5||1||48||7 |- |1980‚Äì81 |First Division |38||1||2||1||3||0||43||2 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !218!!33!!10!!2!!24!!6!!252!!41 |- |rowspan=\\"4\\"|Luton Town |1981‚Äì82 |Second Division |41||1||2||1||2||0||45||2 |- |1982‚Äì83 |First Division |40||4||2||1||4||0||46||5 |- |1983‚Äì84 |First Division |37||3||2||0||2||0||41||3 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !118!!8!!6!!2!!8!!0!!132!!10 |- |rowspan=\\"4\\"|Hull City |1984‚Äì85 |Third Division |22||0||2||0||3||0||27||0 |- |1985‚Äì86 |Second Division |10||0||2||0||1||0||13||0 |- |1986‚Äì87 |Second Division |6||0||0||0||1||0||7||0 |- !colspan=\\"2\\"|Total !38!!0!!4!!0!!5!!0!!47!!0 |- !colspan=\\"3\\"|Career total !610!!74!!36!!8!!43!!6!!689!!88 |} :A.

The valley begins in far eastern Utah, approximately downstream from Flaming Gorge Dam, and follows the river downstream into Colorado, ending at the Gates of Lodore in Dinosaur National Monument. Known as a haven for outlaws such as Butch Cassidy and Tom Horn during the late 19th century and the early 20th century, it is now the location of the Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge. It was also the birthplace of Ann Bassett. She and her sister Josie Bassett, were considered female outlaws and girlfriends to several of Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang. It is the location of John Jarvie Historic Ranch, where, in 1880, Scotsman John Jarvie built a ranch along the Green River. ==History== In the early 19th century, when the Euro-Americans first entered the area, the area was inhabited by Comanche, Shoshoni, and Ute tribal groups. Blackfoot, Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Navajo tribes also visited or used the area. The use of the area by Native Americans was documented by the 1776 Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition and by the 1805 Lewis and Clark Expedition. In the 1830s the valley became a favorite location for fur trappers and settlers. In 1837 Fort Davy Crockett was constructed as a trading post and as defense against attacks by the Blackfoot. The fort was abandoned in the 1840s and the population of settlers declined. After the discovery of gold in California in 1848, the valley emerged among ranchers as a favorite wintering ground for cattle. By the 1860s it had acquired a reputation as haven for cattle rustlers, horse thieves, and outlaws, alongside Hole-in-the-Wall, Wyoming and Robbers Roost in Utah. During its outlaw heyday, the Browns Park ethic allowed for most \\"outlaw deeds\\" except murder. The Wilson Place, near Lodore Hall In 1965 the valley became part of the Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge, designated as a habitat for migratory waterfowl. The refuge contains the remains of several historic sites, including \\"Two Bar Ranch\\" headquarters; Fort Davy Crockett; Lodore Hall (which still serves as a community center); and several old abandoned cabins and homesteader settlements. == Locations of interest in Browns Park == * Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge * Crouse Canyon ‚Äì historic horse trail, modern dirt road * Gates of Lodore ‚Äì historic and modern river access point * Irish Canyon ‚Äì historic horse trail, modern dirt road, petroglyph site * John Jarvie Homestead ‚Äì restored historic homestead * Old Ladore School, or Lodore Hall ‚Äì restored historic school and community hall - listed on the National Register of Historic Places * Swinging Bridge ‚Äì single lane suspension bridge * Two-Bar ranch ruins - near Lodore hall - National Register of Historic Places * Vermillion Falls ‚Äì historic Vermillion Creek site == See also == * Josie Bassett Morris Ranch Complex *John Jarvie Historic Ranch ==References== ==External links== Category:Valleys of Colorado Category:Valleys of Utah Category:Pre-statehood history of Colorado Category:Pre-statehood history of Utah Category:Landforms of Daggett County, Utah Category:Landforms of Moffat County, Colorado ","title":"Browns Park"},{"id":"1996975","text":"Wƒôgorzewo (until 1946 ; , ) is a tourist town on the Angrapa River in northeastern Poland, within the historical region of Masuria. It is the seat of Wƒôgorzewo County in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and is located not far from the border with Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast. Lake Mamry is close to the town. ==Etymology== The town's names in different languages are derived from local names for European eels, which used to live in the area in great numbers. The German name Angerburg () is derived from the Old Prussian word for eel, Anger, which the German Teutonic Knights appropriated after conquering the Old Prussians. The Polish name Wƒôgorzewo (and the older Wƒôgobork) is derived from Wƒôgorz, while the local Lithuanian names Ungura and Unguris comes from Ungurys. A Lithuanian variation is Angerburgas. ==History== === Beginnings=== The town was first mentioned in a 1335 chronicle as Angirburg, or \\"eel castle\\", a settlement of the Teutonic Knights with a block house, a palisade, and a watchtower. A 1341 document reported that the Teutonic Order had bestowed land on the river Angerapp (Angrapa) upon twelve Old Prussians for their loyal service. The Grand Duke of Lithuania, Kƒôstutis, destroyed the castle in 1365, although the order rebuilt the castle out of stone thirty years later. The completion of the stone castle Angerburg allowed the Teutonic Knights to increase development of the surrounding countryside. ===Polish suzerainty=== Wƒôgobork/Angerburg in 1684 As a result of the Thirteen Years‚Äô War (1454‚Äì1466) the settlement came under Polish suzerainty as a fief. The land around the Angerburg castle began to be settled by the end of the 15th century. As it was primarily farmland, the Lake Mamry was blocked up to allow the construction of a watermill. Ca. 1510 a locality known as Neudorf (\\"new village\\") or Gerothwol had developed near the Angerburg. After the foundation of the Duchy of Prussia as a fief of the Kingdom of Poland in 1525, Angerburg/Wƒôgobork became the seat of a district head. Albert, Duke of Prussia, granted the settlement town privileges and determined that it should be called Angerburg like the nearby castle. The Polish inhabitants called the city by its Polish name Wƒôgobork. A large part of the town was destroyed by a fire in 1608, including a wooden church and the 20-year-old town hall. Being situated in Masuria, in the transition area with the ethnographic region of Lithuania Minor, Wƒôgobork/Angerburg had a Polish majority with sizable minorities of Germans and Lithuanians (Lietuvninks). The town suffered from the Swedish-Polish Wars, attacks by the Tatars, and plague epidemics, the last outbreak of which occurred in 1710 and claimed 1,111 victims. To help repopulate the town, 48 people from Salzburg, Austria were resettled here in 1732. The Lithuanian minority diminished after the 16th and 17th centuries, while Poles still formed the majority of the district's population in the early 19th century (52% in 1825). ===Kingdom of Prussia=== Angerburg became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and was named a garrison town of the Prussian Army in 1718. A harbor was built on the Angerapp, allowing an aqueduct to be built in 1740, as well as an expansion of the garrison to include ten barracks. A water supply system was built in 1740 by Jan W≈Çadys≈Çaw Suchodolec. Angerburg had approximately 1,800 inhabitants at this time. Its inhabitants suffered from warfare, however, as Angerburg was occupied by Russian troops during the Seven Years' War. During the Napoleonic Wars, typhus was brought by Russian troops and the town was plundered by French and Polish troops. King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski of Poland stopped in the castle in March and May 1736.Pod Jelonkiem, numer 1/2006, p. 7 (in Polish) Angerburg was included in the Prussian province of East Prussia in 1773 and became the district seat of Landkreis Angerburg in 1818. The town became part of the German Empire upon the Prussian-led unification of Germany in 1871. A teaching seminary and a deaf-mute school were opened in 1820, and the town's population increased to over 3,500. Between 1848 and 1858, Polish pastor and opponent of Germanisation of Masuria Jan Fryderyk Anders was a pastor of the Wƒôgobork Lutheran Parish. The canalization of the Angerapp and the expansion of the harbor in 1856 allowed business to expand, and the garrison left the town in 1858. The district court and the office of the public prosecutor moved from Angerburg to Lyck (E≈Çk) after the Kreistag, or district parliament, hindered the connection of the town to developing road network and railways. Angerburg was first connected to the railroad network in 1898, allowing it to develop into a trade center. The town became especially known for its Behindertenanstalt Bethesda, an institute for those with mental retardation. ==== Historical population ==== In year 1825, the county of Angerburg (including the town) had 24351 inhabitants, including (by mother tongue): 12535 (~52%) Polish, 11756 (~42%) German and 60 Lithuanian. ===World Wars=== Coat of arms of Angerburg from a 1932 postcard. Angerburg became a garrison town again after the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18), when it had a population of 5,800 inhabitants. The German-Russian military cemetery J√§gerh√∂he was located nearby. The war did not impact the town greatly, and Angerburg grew through new housing developments afterwards. Angerburg also began to develop through tourism after the opening of the Angerapp to regular navigation. At the beginning of the Third Reich, the town had a population of 7,700 which profited from a local cavalry regiment. Through incorporation of neighboring communities, Angerburg expanded to include 10,922 inhabitants in 1939. Like the rest of East Prussia, Angerburg was initially only indirectly affected by World War II (1939‚Äì45), such as casualties of war and supply shortages. This situation changed as the eastern front grew near during the winter of 1944-45. Unlike the neighboring town of Goldap to the east, Angerburg was not involved in fighting, but was given up by the Wehrmacht as the Soviet Red Army advanced. After the Red Army reached Elbing and cut off East Prussia from the rest of Germany, the citizens of Angerburg were forced to evacuate the province by traveling across the Vistula Lagoon or to Pillau. The Red Army reached Angerburg on January 25, 1945 and destroyed much of the town; only a few buildings remained of the old town center. ===Poland=== According to the post-war Potsdam Conference, Angerburg was placed under Polish administration and renamed Wƒôgorzewo. The remaining German-speaking population was expelled westward and replaced with Poles who either came from central Poland or were themselves expelled from the Polish Eastern Borderlands (Kresy), especially Wilno (Vilnius) and Grodno. Some Lemko also came from the Beskids. Wƒôgorzewo initially suffered economically after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the Revolutions of 1989, but has become a popular tourist site in the Masurian Lake District. The town is famous for the music festivals which take place in summertime, including a rock festival, a sailors' song festival, and a poetic song festival. ==Notable residents== Wƒôgorzewo Castle and the Angrapa River * Albrycht Zaborowski (1638‚Äì1711), Polish emigrant, one of the pioneers of European colonization within the area of present-day New Jersey * Georg Andreas Helwing (1666‚Äì1748), botanist * Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold (1819‚Äì1884), mathematician * Rodolphe Radau (1835‚Äì1911), astronomer * Kurt Haehling (1893‚Äì1983), Wehrmacht general * Martin Sommerfeld (1894‚Äì1939), Jewish emigre from Nazi Germany to the U.S. * Herbert Jankuhn (1905‚Äì1990), archaeologist * Klaus Ewerth (1907‚Äì1943), Kriegsmarine officer * Andreas Hillgruber (1925‚Äì1989), historian * Bo≈ºena KsiƒÖ≈∫ek (born 1963), Polish sprint canoer * Mariusz Duda (born 1975), Polish musician ==International relations== Town Hall ===Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities=== Wƒôgorzewo is twinned with: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- valign=\\"top\\" | * Leffrinckoucke in France * Yavoriv in Ukraine || || * Chernyakhovsk in Russia * Nemenƒçinƒó in Lithuania |} ==References== ==External links== *Municipal website *Angerburg - Ostpreu√üen, town and district history *Wƒôgorzewo rock music festival Category:Populated places established in the 1330s Category:Castles of the Teutonic Knights Category:Cities and towns in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship Category:Wƒôgorzewo County ","title":"Wƒôgorzewo"},{"id":"1996983","text":"Lord McLaren's grave Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh John McLaren, Lord McLaren, FRSE (17 August 1831 ‚Äì 6 April 1910) was a Scottish Liberal politician and judge.

He was the Together We Can Do More pact candidate for the 2005 Chilean presidential election, winning 5.4% of the vote. == Biography == Hirsch was born in Santiago, Chile, to Jewish-German parents. His mother, Lysa Goldschmidt, arrived in Chile before World War II, while his father, Jorge Hirsch, arrived in the country escaping from German Nazi concentration camps. During his youth, Hirsch became interested in Silo, an Argentinian writer and leader of a movement that inspired the founders of the Humanist Party. In 1974 Hirsch began studying Industrial Civil Engineering at the University of Chile, but dropped out in 1978. Later he began working on his brother's photo company. Hirsch is married to Juanita Vergara and has two children. == Political life == In 1983 Hirsch helped found the Humanist Party, the first political party legalized (1987) under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, and was president of the party from 1994 until 1999. He was also one of the founders of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy (CPD) and served as Chile's ambassador to New Zealand between 1990‚Äì92, under the democratic government of Patricio Aylwin. In January 1993, the Humanist Party withdrew from the CPD. Hirsch unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the lower house of Congress in 1997 and for President in 1999, representing the Humanists. Hirsch was a leading spokesperson for the victims of the Pinochet regime - when Pinochet was under house arrest in London. He would often appear on international news cables demanding that Pinochet be sent to Spain and be put on trial for crimes against humanity. He criticized the government of Ricardo Lagos for pushing for Pinochet‚Äôs release from detention claiming that Pinochet would never stand trial in Chile where he was protected by the Chilean Army and the Chilean political establishment. Hirsch has also been a major critic of the course the Coalition of Parties for Democracy has taken and was cynical of the euphoria created by the election of the socialist president Michelle Bachelet claiming that her government meant a continuation of the same for most Chileans. Hirsch has a highly revolutionary conception of Chilean society and his party calls for systemic changes to the economy to create a more egalitarian, truly socialistic and democratic society for all Chileans. He is also a supporter of the cause of the natives of Chile ‚Äì the Mapuches. Some of his views are close to those of the Communist Party of Chile (with which his party formed an electoral front in the coalition Juntos Podemos M√°s (English: Together we can do more) in the Chilean presidential elections of 2005. He is supported by a broad layer of progressive and left-wing people who believe the political \\"right\\" has unfairly controlled Chilean politics since the end of the Pinochet dictatorship. Hirsch has been arrested on a number of occasions by the Chilean police for taking part in demonstrations in support of political causes. ==References== ==External links== *Official presidential campaign site *Spokesperson of New Humanism for Latinamerica *Notice of Hirsch's lecture in Tel-Aviv, March 2012, on the \\"Park Project Israel- Palestine\\" website Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Candidates for President of Chile Category:Ambassadors of Chile to New Zealand Category:Chilean diplomats Category:Chilean Jews Category:Humanism Category:Chilean humanists Category:Chilean people of German-Jewish descent Category:Politicians from Santiago Category:Humanist Party (Chile) politicians Category:University of Chile alumni ","title":"Tom√°s Hirsch"},{"id":"1997012","text":"The Swan Islands, or Islas Santanilla or Islas del Cisne, initially named Islas de las Pozas by Christopher Columbus in 1502, is a chain of three islands located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately off the coastline of Honduras, with a land area of .The area of the islands was measured by the Honduras Statistical Bureau in square kilometres, but a typist mistook the values as being in square miles, so the true size of 3.1 km2 became recorded as 8 km2. Google Earth photos support this. The islands are uninhabited except for a small permanent Honduran naval garrison stationed on Great Swan Island that maintains the Islas del Cisne Airport. ==Geography== The Swan Islands lie within the exclusive economic zone of Honduras and belong to the Islas de la Bah√≠a department of Honduras. They consist of three islands: * Great Swan Island (3 km long, 2 km2) * Little Swan Island (2.4 km long, 0.5 km wide, 1.2 km2) * Booby Cay (90 metres long, 70 m off the southwestern corner of Great Swan Island, <0.01 km2) Rosario Bank and Misteriosa Bank are north of the Swan Islands and separated from them by the > deep Cayman Trench. ==History== Area map Nautical map of the Swan Islands NASA satellite image The Swan Islands were discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1502 and named the Islas de las Pozas. In the 18th Century, they were renamed the Swan Islands, after Captain Swan, the captain of the Cygnet, whom pirates captured and forced to join them. American entrepreneurs first started exporting guano as a fertilizer in the 1840s. The American-owned, New York- City-headquartered \\"Atlantic and Pacific Guano Company\\" was established in the 1840s and started exporting fertilizer, based on guano collected on the Swan Islands. In 1856, the United States apparently claimed the islands. In April 1857, John Valentine White claimed the islands, by virtue of the Guano Islands Act; later that year, he transferred all interest in these islands to Charles Sterns, Joseph W. Fabens, and Duff Green. Messers Sterns, Fabens, and Green incorporated the Atlantic and Pacific Guano Company, which issued 50,000 shares at a price of $100 each for a total capitalization of $5,000,000 in 1858. The company even issued currency, signed by William H. Whitfield, in 25-cent, 50-cent, and one-dollar denominations on June 1, 1867, to facilitate commerce on the islands. Subsequently, a chemical company bought the islands but became insolvent. Captain Alonzo Adams sailed there in 1893 and took possession of the islands; in 1904, he assigned ownership to the Swan Island Commercial Company. That company leased part of Great Swan Island to the United Fruit Company, which grew coconut palms and set up a wireless radio relay station for servicing their Caribbean fleet but eventually abandoned the lease. The Swan Island Commercial Company provided hurricane monitoring data from 1928 to 1932. The U.S. Weather Bureau manned a hurricane weather station on Great Swan from 1938 onward, but staffed it only during hurricane seasons. During World War II, both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Weather Bureau stationed personnel on the island. In the late 1940s until 1949, Swan Island became a U.S. Department of Agriculture animal quarantine station for the importation of beef. In 1914, what now is the National Weather Service (NWS) and, later, the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) set up meteorological and communication assets on Swan to support aeronautical services and hurricane-prediction activities. The FAA departed Swan Island in the 1960s, leaving the NWS all assets and responsibilities. Honduras claimed these islands from 1923, asserting that, because Columbus had discovered the islands while sailing for Spain, they should be owned by the nearest Spanish-speaking country. Both the United States and Honduras claimed the Swan Islands until the United States dropped its claim under the Guano Islands Act. A treaty was signed on November 22, 1971, and clear title by Honduras became effective September 1, 1972. The ownership of the island had long been in dispute. The Sumner Smith family has always maintained their ownership and, apparently, did have some standing in the U.S. courts. Nevertheless, the American government chose to abandon its claim despite this standing (ref. D S Platt, et al., NOAA-NWS). The islands gained notoriety in the early 1960s from the activities of Radio Swan, which began broadcasting in May 1960 during the preparation for and, later, the conduct of the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The station was removed from the islands in the late 1960s, its main transmitter then transferred for use in the Vietnam War. In 1965, Bellaire, Texas, police questioned a former Bellaire High School student about his role in a teenage \\"army\\" dedicated to freeing \\"oppressed countries,\\" the Houston Chronicle reported. The group, called the Kononiers, had been in existence for about five years, the student told the newspaper, and was armed through a series of burglaries of the Deep River Armory store. The weapons were taken to the Addicks Reservoir area, where they trained for combat. The youths were training for \\"Operation Liberation Swan Island\\" off Honduras. In 1987, the Los Angeles Times reported that the CIA and other American governmental agencies had a covert training facility on Swan Island for Nicaraguan Contras. In 1989, the president of Honduras, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, declared the island a protected wildlife refuge. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch moved through the area with winds of . In 2001, Swan Island Development, LLC, of Brooksville, Florida, announced plans to develop the Swan Islands by 2010, in partnership with the government of Honduras. Luxury real estate and hotels, valued at five billion dollars, were envisioned, with a main city named Cygnet. In 2004, Swan Island Development also announced plans to establish a human stem-cell research center. ==See also== * United States Miscellaneous Caribbean Islands * List of Guano Island claims * Honduras ‚Äì United Kingdom Maritime Delimitation Treaty ==References== ==External links== *History of the Swan Islands Category:Caribbean islands of Honduras Category:History of the Caribbean Category:Caribbean islands claimed under the Guano Islands Act Category:Former regions and territories of the United States Category:Uninhabited islands of Honduras Category:Former disputed islands ","title":"Swan Islands, Honduras"},{"id":"1997019","text":"Broken China is the second and final solo album by Pink Floyd keyboard player Richard Wright.Broken China, Richard Wright, Prog Archives. == Overview == The album is a four-part concept album based on Wright's then-wife Mildred's battle with depression, and is very much like a classic Pink Floyd concept album in its structure and overall feel.

She was played by Pam St Clement from 12 June 1986, just over a year after the show first aired, until her departure on 1 January 2012. Pat was also portrayed by Emma Cooke in a soap 'bubble' Pat and Mo: Ashes to Ashes, delving into her past with sister-in-law Mo Harris (Laila Morse), which aired in 2004. The character was killed-off on 1 January 2012, shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her funeral was on 13 January 2012. Pat was one of the longest serving characters on the show, being on it for twenty-five years and six months. She returned along with other women from Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) past in a concussion-related dream sequence for a Children in Need special on 14 November 2014. She also made a return as a hallucination for Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) death on 17 May 2016. ==Storylines== ===Backstory=== Pat as she appeared in Pat and Mo, played by Emma Cooke. Pat is the youngest of four children. Her sister, Joan, had Down's syndrome, and was sent to a mental institution when Pat was four. Joan married Michael, who also had Down's. Their mother, Lydia, disowned Joan and claimed she had died at age 22. After leaving school at 15, Pat unsuccessfully tried to become a model. She and her best friend, Mo Porter (Laila Morse), entered a beauty contest in Clacton at 16, winning the title of \\"Miss Butlins\\". There she met Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), who was holidaying with his girlfriend, June Simmonds. Frank was besotted with Pat, and they slept together. Frank was the first of what would be many lovers in Pat's life, and so began a love affair. However, June became pregnant with Frank's child, so Frank married her, breaking Pat's heart. Pat and Frank would meet up from time to time, and on each occasion the affair would be rekindled, but Frank would not leave June. Pat began working for shady club owner Tony Cattani (Vas Constanti), who got her involved in prostitution. This shamed her family, particularly her brother Jimmy (Alex King), and their relationship suffered. When Pat discovered that Mo, now Jimmy's wife, had slept with Tony, she informed her brother; Mo denied it, and Jimmy subsequently disowned Pat. While working as a prostitute, Pat was offered more money to work for up-and-coming gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Pat then worked as a well-known woman of the underworld for many years. Pat embarked on numerous relationships. She had flings with Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell)‚Äîboth restless men, unwilling to settle down with her. Kenny's younger brother Pete (Peter Dean) proved more reliable; he married Pat when he thought she was pregnant by him‚Äîa false alarm which his mother Lou (Anna Wing) believed was Pat's ploy to trap her son. While they were together, Pat had two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), who Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down and embarked on an affair with Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield). Pete eventually left her and they divorced. Soon after, Pat married Brian and he took on responsibility of her two sons. They left Walford due to David's feud with fellow schoolboy Derek Branning (Terence Beesley; Jamie Foreman) who terrorised the entire family because David got his sister Carol (Lindsey Coulson) pregnant. They moved to Romford and Pat stayed with Brian until 1986, when he started physically abusing her.EastEnders books, The EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsley, ===1986‚Äì2016=== Pat as she appeared in 1986. The image shows the character's typical earrings and manner of dress. Pat comes to Walford in June 1986, to tell Pete that he is not Simon's father. Many arguments erupt, but Lou steps in to convince a devastated Pete that Simon is his. When Pat starts work as a barmaid in The Queen Victoria pub later that year, she finds that Lou thinks Simon is Kenny's son, following an affair and she's adamant that Pat should keep this secret and not upset her close-knit family but Pete's twin sister Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) overhears and tells Pete everything. Pat lives up to her promiscuous reputation and, with encouragement from Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer), ends the year, prostituting herself. Animosity between Pat and Pete continues. When Pat is assaulted in February 1987 ‚Äî left unconscious and close to death in the middle of the Square ‚Äî Pete is prime suspect in the police investigation. He is later cleared when the real culprit, the Walford Attacker, is caught. The arrival of Kenny in 1988 brings the question of Simon's parentage to the fore once again. Pat tells Simon and the Beale brothers that she does not know who is the father, adding further confusion. She also says that Den is a possibility but later rules Den out and demands that he has sex with her, or she will tell people that he is the father. That July, a dying Lou pleads with Pat to finally tell Simon the truth. Pat reveals that Brian, the man that Simon believed to be his stepfather, is actually his biological father.EastEnders books, EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration by Colin Brake, Following Lou's death, Pat forms a close friendship with her former foe, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Pete's second wife. They find they had a common bond, with the dominance of Lou and Pete in their lives. Frank comes back into Pat's life in 1987. June has died and he and Pat reunite, taking over tenancy of The Queen Vic. Pat struggles as stepmother to Frank's children, particularly his youngest daughter, Janine Butcher (Rebecca Michael). On 22 June 1989, Pat and Frank marry in Cockney style, driving out of Albert Square in a horse-drawn cart. By the end of 1989, the Butchers have moved from The Queen Vic to the B&B; across the Square, which Pat runs while Frank opens a used car lot. Despite family and marital problems, Frank and Pat are happy until 1992 when they begin to struggle financially, forcing them to sell the B&B.; Pat tries to turn their fortunes around by starting a cab firm, PatCabs. However, disaster strikes on Christmas Eve that year, when Pat ‚Äî doing a short run for a regular customer ‚Äî hits a teenage girl who later dies from her injuries. She struggles to cope with the guilt, particularly when confronted by the girl's mother. When breathalysed, she is found to be just over the limit. When Pat appears in court several months later, she is imprisoned for six months. Pat returns in the autumn, but by then the Butchers are in financial ruin. In desperation, Frank pays Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to torch the car lot in an insurance scam. When this goes wrong and a homeless boy dies, Frank has a breakdown and in April 1994, he abandons Pat and his children, leaving Pat destitute and heartbroken. Eventually, Frank's daughter Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) brings news that Frank is alive, and so Pat begins getting on with her life.EastEnders books, EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square by Rupert Smith, Car dealer Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) arrives in Albert Square and is attracted to Pat, but early attempts to woo her get him nothing but refusals. Pat later softens and goes on a cruise with him, although she makes it clear that sex is not on offer. Her carnal abstinence is a blessing for Roy, as he later admits he is impotent and can offer nothing more than platonic love. Pat is relieved to discover that, for once, a man wants something from her other than sex. In November 1995, Roy moves in with Pat, but on Christmas Day, Frank returns. Pat finds it hard to contain her rage and emotion when she sees her estranged husband, but despite him stirring up old feelings, she chooses to stay with Roy and they marry in 1996. Pat and Roy weather money problems, Roy's ill-health and depression, brought on by his jealousy of Pat and Frank's shared past, which almost makes him commit suicide in 1998. Pat finally convinces Roy that it was him she wants, although she finds it hard to let go of Frank completely. Frank goes on to marry Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), but he begins to have second thoughts in 2000, after realising that he still loves Pat. While Pat, Roy, Frank, Peggy, Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards) and Irene Raymond (Roberta Taylor) are holidaying in Spain, Frank seduces Pat. Pat tries to end the affair, but when Frank turns up on her doorstep naked (apart from a comedy bow-tie), she realises that she had never stopped loving him either. Their affair continues and they eventually decide to elope to Manchester. They are due to depart on Guy Fawkes Night in November 2000, when Pat has second thoughts. But it is too late ‚Äî Peggy has already found Frank's farewell letter, and shames the cheating duo by reading it to the entire pub before slapping Frank and Pat. Peggy throws Frank out and he leaves Walford alone. Roy is initially willing to forgive Pat and explains that certain things have got to change but his son, Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), alerts him to a suitcase containing massage oils, fishnet stockings, and a red Basque that Pat was planning to take with her for Frank. Roy is horrified and throws Pat out, leaving her penniless and homeless. Roy later asks Pat for a divorce and in February 2001, Pat decides to join Simon in New Zealand, but Roy follows her to the airport and tells her that he wants to be with her, despite Barry's objections. Grateful that Roy has given her a second chance, Pat is adamant that she will not mess things up again. However, in March 2003, Roy discovers that Pat knew that Barry's wife, Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed), was having an affair with Frank's son, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). Roy believes that Pat has again chosen to support Frank's offspring over his own, and the stress causes Roy's second and fatal heart attack. Roy dies intestate, leaving Pat bereft and homeless, as Barry ‚Äî beneficiary of Roy's estate ‚Äî evicts her, despite Pat's efforts to support Barry and help rebuild his life, after the double blow of his marriage break-up and the death of his father. Pat moves into a bedsit. Janine (now played by Charlie Brooks) marries Barry and plans to con him out of all of his money and possessions. The day after the wedding, Janine admits everything and pushes Barry down a cliff to his death. She later brags about it to a disgusted Pat and starts to bully Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman). When Laura accidentally falls down the stairs and dies, Janine is arrested on suspicion of murder. Pat, who is Janine's alibi, lies to the police and so Janine is implicated as revenge for Barry's death. Pat is given a job at the bookies by gangster Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) in 2004. They develop a rapport and when Andy is murdered by Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) in 2005, Pat is stunned to discover that he has left her his house in his will. Pat is summoned as a witness for the prosecution at Janine's trial in December 2005, where she meets Frank again. Once again, they have sex, but she soon realises that his primary motive is to convince her to alter her testimony at Janine's trial. Pat refuses, but Frank assures her that he will always love her. In February 2006, missing male company, Pat begins flirting with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who is married but unable to resist the chance at a casual fling with Pat. Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) sees them together and tells Patrick's wife, Yolande (Angela Wynter), which ends the affair and ignites a feud between Pat and Yolande. In August 2007, Pat discovers her mother lied about the date of her sister Joan's death. She and a kind stranger, Len Harker (Christopher Ellison), break into Joan's care home and learn that Joan died only a few years earlier after marrying a man with Down's syndrome. Pat is touched to discover that Joan often spoke of how much she loved her. In March 2008, Pat announces she is leaving Walford for Spain, but gets news that Frank has died of throat cancer. She is devastated and despite initial feuding, she and Peggy support each other through Frank's funeral. Pat opts to remain in Walford when her granddaughter Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) turns to her for help soon after, moving in with her four children. Having reconciled with one grandchild, Pat severs her bond with another when she discovers Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) is hiding his runaway half-sister, Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Pat threatens to tell Lucy's father, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), the truth and is hit by a car driven by Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) car whilst trying to apprehend Steven. She spends time in hospital, where Steven attempts to smother her before she can tell Ian. His plan fails, and Lucy returns to Ian. Pat suffers a heart attack in January 2010 amidst increasing animosity with Janine. It is revealed that she has an underlying condition and needs a pacemaker but refuses to have the operation. Janine persuades Pat to have the pacemaker fitted and she makes a full recovery. Disgusted with the litter in Albert Square, Peggy and Pat both decide to run for council. They are interviewed by journalist Harvey Freeman (Martin Jarvis) but eventually they both pull out of the election. Harvey secretly woos them both, causing various rows between the women when they find out. They both finally unite against Harvey and humiliate him in punishment. Pat and Peggy's friendship strengthens, so Pat is hurt when Peggy leaves Walford without saying goodbye, upset to lose her best friend. When Pat discovers that Janine stabbed herself in order to frame Stacey after making the discovery that she killed Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), she disowns Janine and goes to New Zealand to visit Simon. She returns in April to find that Bianca is in prison and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) is missing, although she is relieved when Whitney returns home shortly after. When Pat discovers that Ricky and Janine's maternal grandmother, Lydia Simmonds (Margaret Tyzack; Heather Chasen), is staying with Janine, she believes that Janine is only interested in Lydia's inheritance and Janine jokingly admits this to Pat, although a close bond soon forms between Janine and Lydia. When Lydia dies in the night, Pat comforts Janine but later turns on her, believing that she killed Lydia to get her money, despite the fact Janine had already seen the will and knew that Lydia was donating her money to charity. When the police take Janine in for questioning over Lydia's death, Janine believes Pat phoned them, although it is later revealed that it was Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott). Pat is still adamant that Janine murdered Lydia, which causes an emotional argument. When it is discovered that Lydia has changed her will and leaves her whole estate to Janine, Pat persuades Lydia's son Norman (George Layton) to contest the will. He initially agrees, but after Janine agrees to share the money with Ricky, Pat convinces him to change his mind. Although Norman likes Pat and wants to see her again, Pat is oblivious to this. When Pat discovers that Simon is about to lose his home in New Zealand, she fails to get a loan to help him because of her age. Norman offers to help and organises a loan for her. After speaking to her great-grandson Liam Butcher (James Forde), Pat decides she likes Norman, they kiss, and she asks him to stay. The next day Norman tells Patrick that he regularly earns commission for organising loans for people. Patrick then warns Pat about this, and once Pat finds out that the terms of the loan mean if she misses a payment she could lose her house, she rejects Norman, tells him to leave, and says she never wants to see him again. Derek arrives in Walford and recognises Pat. She runs away, but he chases her and forces his way into her home. Pat is fearful of Derek, and he taunts her, asking Pat if she is still a prostitute. Derek also tells her to tell David that he has not forgotten about their fight. When Roxy asks Pat about Derek's past, Pat confirms that he is dangerous. Pat struggles to keep up the loan repayments on her house, and counts on Ricky's bonus money to cover the debt. When Ricky returns from Dubai, he reveals that he has lost all his money, so Pat explains that they will lose the house by the end of the week if a payment is not made. A desperate Pat turns to Janine and asks for money. Janine gives her ¬£50,000 without hesitation, but insists on Pat using the house as collateral, although this does not thaw the animosity between the pair. When Janine's boyfriend Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) spots Derek and Liam together, he forms an allegiance with Pat over their hatred of him and they proceed to call his probation officer to check up on him, infuriating Derek. He later confronts Pat, angrily threatening her. Shortly after, Patrick drops into Pat's and finds her collapsed on her kitchen floor. Pat is admitted to hospital having suffered a pulmonary embolus and the doctors run some tests but she discharges herself secretly, telling Ricky she has been allowed to go. Shortly after, Janine goes to see Pat, telling her she is moving the repayment deadline to the following day after an argument with Bianca. Pat rings Simon to find out whether he can pay her the money but is left horrified when he tells her his brother David slept with his wife. As her stress increases, Pat's chest pains continue and Patrick persuades her to return to the hospital. There, she is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which has metastasised to her lungs, bones and abdomen. Pat refuses all further palliative treatment and returns to Walford to be with her loved ones, sharing one last drink with her family and friends in The Queen Vic. On New Year's Day 2012, Pat's health rapidly deteriorates and she is visited by old friends including Ian and Dot (June Brown). Janine arrives to evict the family after Pat is unable to pay all her debts back but soon realises that Pat is not faking her illness and is devastated. Visiting her sick stepmother, Janine confesses to Pat that she is pregnant and Pat convinces her to keep the baby, before they finally reconcile. Later, David arrives to see Pat but the pair argue and David leaves, David is persuaded to return by Carol. David tells Pat that he is sorry for the mess he has made of things over the years. David then tells Pat that he forgives her for all the times she let him down when he was a child. Pat tells David that she is scared moments before she dies. Everybody on the Square mourns for Pat the next day, and Norman comes back with a bunch of flowers for her, not knowing that she has already died. Pat's funeral, which is paid for by Janine, takes place and is attended by many Albert Square residents. Simon turns up after the funeral has ended with flowers and lays them down at her grave. In September 2013, Peggy returns and visits Pat's house to say goodbye, leaving a bottle of gin on her doorstep. In May 2016, Peggy returns to Walford with terminal cancer that has spread to her brain. As her senses are affected, she hallucinates that Pat is in her home and they reminisce about their shared past. Peggy asks her to never leave her and Pat promises this, as Peggy takes a fatal overdose of her medication. ==Creation and development== A selection of earrings worn by the EastEnders character Pat Butcher, played by Pam St Clement, on display at the EastEnders Meet and Greet event. The character of Pat was conceived by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, in 1984. Although not one of the serial's original protagonists, Pat is referred to in the character outline of Pete Beale, who appeared on-screen in EastEnders' first episode, as written by Smith and Holland in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story: \\"[Pete] married very young to Pat‚Äîit turned out to be a total disaster. They were too young, rushing into a difficult life for all the wrong reasons, and truthfully, [Pat] was a vicious shrew...[Pete] divorced [Pat] and married Kathy when he was 24...His two sons by his first marriage are nineteen and twenty and he hardly sees them...\\" Pat was first seen on-screen in June 1986, over a year after the show debuted. The character's introduction was the result of a deliberate policy \\"to add an extra edge of toughness to the show.\\" Prior to this point, Holland and Smith had begun to feel that EastEnders was starting to get \\"a bit soft\\". During a meeting with scriptwriters, the programme makers decided to try to recapture some of the soap's \\"original grittiness that seemed to be getting lost in its own success\\". Thus the character of Pat was introduced to \\"add a new hardness to the atmosphere.\\" Pat, played by actress Pam St Clement, was initially introduced on a three-episode trial basis. She was given an extensive backstory, heavily intertwined with various focal characters within the serial, including all of the Beale and Fowler family who mostly disliked her, particularly her ex-husband Pete Beale (Peter Dean), her son Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), and Pete's mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing). In addition, she was an old friend of Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), a former lover of Angie's husband Den (Leslie Grantham) and, as a supposed former resident of Walford, she was known to many of the other regular characters such as Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). The character's initial three-episode stint marked the beginning of what has been described as one of the soap's most complicated storylines, the paternity of Simon Wicks. Pat immediately \\"threw a spanner in the works\\" by telling Pete that he was not Simon's biological father, as she had previously claimed. After causing havoc Pat then disappeared; however, she was reintroduced later in the year, returning as a regular character, barmaid of The Queen Victoria public house. St. Clement had reservations about returning to the soap. In 1995 she told The Independent, \\"I couldn't envisage how this character, who creates absolute havoc everywhere she goes and is not at home with herself or with anybody else in the Square, could possibly fit in\\". However, she was persuaded to continue by producer Julia Smith, who said: \\"'We've only seen one layer of the onion skin‚Äîthe defensiveness‚Äînow we'll start to peel away more and get to the vulnerability that lies behind it'.\\" ===Friendship with Peggy Mitchell=== In 1998, Pat and her friend Peggy develop a feud with each other after Frank had an affair with Peggy. An EastEnders insider said: \\"Viewers will see the lot - tears, screaming and fighting. The romance has brought the studios to a standstill,\\" said the insider. \\"There are TV screens around Elstree where staff can see what is being filmed and it has literally stopped people in their tracks. For the two days it was being filmed, staff on the lot talked about nothing else. Frank and Peggy are two of the show's strongest, most popular characters and the writers have hit on the idea of bringing Pat, another of the show's big names, in on the plot. Devoting a whole episode to just two characters is a tactic which has proved successful in the past. \\"We have used it for Michelle and Lofty and also for Dot Cotton and Lou Beale. St. Clement and Barbara are both first-class actresses and everyone at the BBC feels they will carry the explosive episode off with flying colours.\\" The scenes showing the characters' first fight had to be cut in order to be broadcast before the 9pm watershed as they were \\"powerful\\" and still was one of the \\"impressive episodes of all time\\". Barbara Windsor told the Sunday Mirror: \\"The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. When I saw the programme I couldn't believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud.\\" In an interview with TV Buzz, Barbara Windsor commented on Pat and Peggy's relationship: \\"I really loved Pat and Peggy's friendship, but my most memorable scenes involve us slapping each other; and we both really went for it! The fan mail we received would always go up a notch when they had a fight. We'd call each other everything under the sun too. Well, as far as we could go - obviously we couldn't swear. I'd love to have done a late-night episode - you'd have heard proper language then!\\" She added: \\"My favourite storyline was where Peggy whacked Pat and Frank in The Vic. I stood on my little box - because I'm so tiny - and bang! Pat's earring went flying, then I fell off the box! I did a Norman Wisdom trip. It was very funny. ===Departure and death=== Bryan Kirkwood (pictured) stated that St. Clement's departure would be a \\"fitting\\" storyline. On 7 July 2011, it was announced that St. Clement had quit EastEnders. The actress revealed that she wanted to try other things, saying \\"I have enjoyed 25 and a half wonderful years in EastEnders creating the character of Pat but feel it's time to hang up her earrings. Leaving the EastEnders 'family' will be akin to a bereavement. But I'm looking forward to the other work and life opportunities that I will have the time to pursue.\\" Pat will leave later in the year and executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said her departure would be a \\"fitting\\" storyline. Pat's son David Wicks returned for her departure storyline. Pat was killed off in the special New Year's Day episode. St. Clement said she was pleased for a dramatic exit. She told The Sun: \\"They didn't just want me to say ta-ta and get on the No 30 bus because that wouldn't do me justice. They wanted something dramatic, a fitting tribute to the character.\\" She said that the loss of Peggy, Pauline and herself would spell the end of the EastEnders \\"matriarchs\\". She added: \\"A trio of people all of the same age leaving does leave a gap. Who is next in the age line? There isn't anyone.\\" On 31 December 2011, it was announced that Pat would be getting her own exit theme. EastEnders music composer Simon May reworked the tune to create \\"Pat's Theme\\". An EastEnders insider told Digital Spy: \\"It's only right that as we say goodbye to the iconic Pat Evans we pay tribute to such a character with a wonderfully touching special theme tune. As we say farewell to a legend of over 26 years, we welcome in what will be a truly remarkable New Year in E20 by adding the Olympic Park into the opening title sequence.\\" Barbara Windsor who played Peggy Mitchell predicted that Pat would be \\"sorely missed\\" by fans. Speaking of Pat's exit, Windsor told This Morning: \\"Oh, I can't bear it - Pam! And she will be sorely missed - more than I was missed in the show, because she could go to anybody - any family she could go into. I am devastated.\\" She definitely wanted to leave, but I don't know if she wanted to be killed off - that's the chance you have to take,\\" Windsor continued. \\"I was positive that I was going to go up in a load of flames with The Vic - I thought that was going to happen, but of course it didn't. With Pam, I was very, very surprised, because she could always go back. But she's accepted it now and she'll have a new life.\\" St. Clement stated that she didn't want her character to die, but said her final scenes were \\"fantastic\\". St. Clement commented: \\"Simon Ashdown had this idea for the character, which fitted in with her history in a sense,\\" she explained. \\"They said, 'This is how we'd like it to happen - we think it's a fitting end and tribute to the character'. And as far as I can say, I read the script and I thought, 'Oh, this is fantastic - it's every actor's dream'. And I have to say, it also challenged me in a way that I hadn't been challenged. It was moving, it was challenging and it was a script that I needed to get my teeth into. The script, the performances, the direction - it all turned out to be a fantastic ensemble piece, if you like‚Ä¶ Everybody was pulling in, everybody was doing the most wonderful performances and it was fantastic.\\" St. Clement said she was \\"moved\\" by the Farewell Pat tribute. Speaking on Daybreak, St. Clement explained: \\"I wasn't going to watch [the final episode] with anybody - I was going to record it and then watch it in a darkened room somewhere, where I could be terribly critical and jump about saying, 'Stupid woman - why did you play it like that?' But everybody said, 'Oh no, sit down'. I said, 'I don't want to disturb you all' - but I did make myself behave! And I was quite dispassionate, actually. The strange thing is, after I read the script, I was very moved by it. But as soon as I started working on it, I think everybody did start getting quite emotional - but I couldn't. Even about myself leaving - people in the cast would come up and say, 'How do you feel?' and I'd say, 'I can't go there, I can't think about that, because the work's not finished'. The strange thing is, the only thing that moved me was the Farewell Pat programme. Which is strange, but I suppose that was personal in a sense.\\" Also, St. Clement explained the experience of filming her final episode. She added: \\"It was a great challenge, that script,\\" she commented. \\"I looked at it and thought, 'Oh, heck, how do I give light and shade to something where somebody is actually dying?' And some of the scenes could have been interpreted as being somewhat similar with Janine and David. So I had to make them different - but I had to make them different within the confines of the illness.\\" It was later confirmed that EastEnders would air a special tribute episode to Pat after her funeral episode on 13 January 2012. An EastEnders insider commented: \\"Pat is EastEnders - she was the heart and soul of the show and bosses have pulled out all the stops for her funeral. Not only is the episode extra long, with plenty of nods to the iconic lady, it really is the end of the earring. We are hoping that everyone dons their biggest and tackiest earrings to mark one of the saddest days in the history of Walford.\\" Co-star Lindsey Coulson said that Pat's departure was a \\"real-loss\\". She told This Morning: \\"They were really difficult scenes to play, because we didn't want Pam to leave,\\" Coulson explained. \\"So apart from not wanting to lose the wonderful character of Pat, we were mourning the loss of Pam. \\"You don't see everybody all the time [at EastEnders] at all, and sometimes you can go for months without seeing somebody. And most of the time you're on this big wheel and when people leave, you go, 'Oh, that's really sad', but you get back on. But actually Pam is a real loss up there.\\" Former EastEnders cast member Martin Kemp said that the decision for Pat to leave was the \\"right\\" thing to do. He told Bang Showbiz: \\"I still watch EastEnders from time to time. I did quite a few scenes with Pam, I remember we spent three or four days locked in a cellar once so we had quite some scenes. She's a great actress, I'm sure she'll go on to other things. I think she's making the right move, it's nice to spread your wings a bit. Although viewers will miss her I don't think anyone is bigger than the show, it doesn't matter who comes or who goes. When I was there I always thought the star of the show was and always will be the pub, The Queen Vic. Everything else is an extra around it.\\" == In popular culture == The character of Pat has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch series 2DTV. The impressionist who provides the voice is Jan Ravens, Who has not only provided the voice of Pat, but also acted the part on-screen in several episodes of the BBC's Big Impression, which devoted a regular sketch to various EastEnders characters, and she also played Pat in the other impressionist series Dead Ringers. The Impressions Show with Culshaw and Stephenson also contains sketches where impressionist Debra Stephenson portrays Pat in situations, often with Coronation Street character Ken Barlow, played by Jon Culshaw. She is also the frequent target of jokes in Harry Hill's TV Burp, usually alluding to her former prostitution and alleged sexual promiscuity. Comedian Lee Evans had once used Pat as one of his jokes in his tour Live at the O2 Arena. In the first episode of Series 3 of The Inbetweeners, Jay gets his ears pierced with large round earrings and is mocked by his friend Simon Cooper, who calls it the ‚ÄòPat Butcher look‚Äô. == References == ==External links== * Category:Television characters introduced in 1986 Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional prostitutes Category:Fictional bookmakers Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional child killers Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Fictional ghosts Category:Fictional domestic abuse victims Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Pat Butcher"},{"id":"1997035","text":"Roger Gaudry, (December 15, 1913 - October 7, 2001) was a chemist, businessman, corporate director, and former rector of the Universit√© de Montr√©al. =Early life and education= Born in Quebec City, Quebec, he received a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Chemistry in 1937 and a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in Chemistry in 1940 from Universit√© Laval.

Bruton batted left-handed and threw right- handed. ==Career== Bill Bruton, as a 27-year-old rookie, started his major league career in 1953 with the Milwaukee Braves. The team has just moved from Boston to Milwaukee. Bruton had replaced former National League's 1950 Rookie of the Year winner and first African-American player on the Braves, Sam Jethroe, on the roster. Jethroe, at the age of 35, had been demoted to the minor leagues. He had led the NL in stolen bases his first two seasons. On April 14, 1953, his 10th-inning home run gave the Braves a 3‚Äì2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Milwaukee's first major league game. Bruton played in Milwaukee for eight seasons; he was a member of the 1957 Braves and 1958 Braves, who both played World Series against the New York Yankees. Bruton did not play in the 1957 World Series, which the Braves won in seven games, due to a knee injury sustained earlier in the season. In the 1958 World Series, which the Braves lost in seven games, Bruton hit a game-winning single in the tenth inning of Game 1. He played in all seven games of the Series, batting 7-for-17 (.412) with a home run and two RBIs. On August 2, 1959, Bruton hit two bases- loaded triples in one game. The feat had only been accomplished once before (Elmer Valo, 1949) and has only been accomplished once since (Duane Kuiper, 1978). In December 1960, Bruton was traded to the Detroit Tigers, along with Dick Brown (baseball), Chuck Cottier and Terry Fox (baseball) for a player to be named later and Frank Bolling. The Detroit Tigers sent Neil Chrisley (January 17, 1961) to the Milwaukee Braves to complete the trade. He spent four seasons with Detroit before retiring after the 1964 season.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brutobi01.shtml ===Statistics=== In his twelve-year major league career, Bruton posted an overall .273 batting average with 94 home runs and 545 run batted in in 1,610 games. He finished his career with a .981 fielding percentage. A line-drive hitter and a fleet-footed runner, Bruton led the National League in stolen bases for three consecutive seasons (1953 through 1955), twice in triples (1956 and 1960), and once in runs scored (1960). He led off a game with a home run twelve times. Bruton's minor league milestones include; *tied for the Northern League lead in games played (124), and led the league in at-bats (545), runs (126), and batting average (.325) while playing for the Eau Claire Bears in 1950 *led the Western League with 27 triples while playing for the Denver Bears in 1951 *tied for the American Association lead in games played (154), at-bats (650), runs (130), hits (211), and outfield assists (22) while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1952 ==Personal life== Bruton was a graduate of Parker High School in Birmingham, Alabama, and served in the Army from 1944 through 1947. He was a spokesman for Tareyton cigarettes in the 1960s. In 1991, Bruton was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. According to a Delaware State Police report, Bruton suffered a heart attack while driving his car in Marshallton, Delaware, near his home in Wilmington on December 5, 1995. Apparently, Bruton's car veered off the road and hit a pole; after which he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. He was 70. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders ==References== *1955 Baseball Register, published by The Sporting News ==Further reading== * *Profile and highlights at Baseball Library via Wayback Machine *Obituary at The Deadball Era via Wayback Machine ==External links== *Bill Bruton at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Bill Bruton at The Deadball Era * : Category:1925 births Category:1995 deaths Category:African-American baseball players Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:People from Sumter County, Alabama Category:Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball) players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Detroit Tigers scouts Category:Eau Claire Bears players Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) players Category:National League stolen base champions Category:Road incident deaths in Delaware ","title":"Bill Bruton"},{"id":"1997048","text":"Crown Jewels of Bohemia The Bohemian Crown Jewels, also called the Czech Crown Jewels (), include the Crown of Saint Wenceslas (Svatov√°clavsk√° koruna), the royal orb and sceptre, the coronation vestments of the Kings of Bohemia, the gold reliquary cross, and St. Wenceslas' sword.

The Coronation robe was used from 1653 until 1836. It is made from precious silky red material called \\"zlatohlav\\" and is lined with ermine (fur of the stoat). The robe is stored separately from jewelry in a specially air conditioned repository. For the coronation ceremonies, St. Wenceslas' sword, a typical Gothic weapon, was used. The first mention of the sword reported in historical records is in 1333, but the blade dates back to the 10th century, while the hilt is from the 13th century and textiles are probably from the time of Charles IV. The iron blade length is 76 cm, at the widest point is 45 mm and has a ripped hole in a cross shape (45 x 20 mm). The wooden handle is covered with yellow-brown fabric and velvet embroidered with the ornament of laurel twigs with thick silver thread. After coronation ceremonies, the sword was used for the purpose of granting knighthoods. The oldest leather case for the crown was made for Charles IV in 1347. On top are inscribed four symbols: the Imperial eagle, Bohemian lion, the coat of arms of Arno≈°t of Pardubice and emblem of the Archbishopric of Prague. The door to Crown Jewels chamber, and likewise the iron safe, is hardly accessible and has seven locks. There are seven holders of the keys: the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Prague Archbishop, the Chairman of the House of Deputies, the Chairman of the Senate, the Dean of the Metropolitan Chapter of St. Vitus Cathedral and the Mayor of Prague, who must all convene to facilitate opening the impenetrable door and coffer. ==History== Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, wearing the original crown jewels The crown is named and dedicated after the Duke St. Wenceslaus of the P≈ôemyslids dynasty of Bohemia. The jewels should be permanently stored in the chapel of St. Wenceslaus in St. Vitus. They were only lent to Kings, and only on the day of the coronation, and should be returned in the evening that day. After 1918 and the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic the Coronation Jewels ceased to serve their original function, but remained important as symbols of national independence and statehood. In the past, the Jewels were kept in different places, but have been always brought to royal coronations in Prague. Wenceslaus IV (1378-1419) probably moved them to Karl≈°tejn Castle. They were then repeatedly moved for safety reasons: in the 17th century, they were returned to Prague Castle, during the Thirty Years' War (1631) they were sent to a parish church in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, and then they were secretly taken to the Imperial Treasury, Vienna (1637). While the Jewels were stored in Vienna, the original gold orb and sceptre from the 14th century were replaced with current ones. The new orb and sceptre probably originated with an order by Ferdinand I in 1533. Possible reasons for this replacement might be that the originals were simply too austere, and lacked any precious stones. Deemed unrepresentative of the prestige of the Kingdom of Bohemia, it made sense to replace them with an orb and sceptre in an ornate, jeweled style that resembled the crown.The royal orb and sceptre The original sceptre and orb from 14th century in Vienna The Jewels were brought back to Prague on the occasion of the coronation of Bohemian king Leopold II in 1791. At that time, the current tradition of seven keys was established, though the holders of the keys in the course of time were changed according to political and administrative structures. The jewels were kept in Vienna due to the threat from the Prussian Army, but were later returned to Prague, arriving in the city on 28 August 1867. According to the ancient tradition and regulations laid down by Charles the Fourth in the 14th century, the Jewels are exhibited only to mark special occasions. Exhibitions can take place only at the Prague Castle. In the 20th century there were nine such moments in history. The President of the Republic has the exclusive right to decide on the display of the Crown Jewels. An ancient Czech legend says that any usurper who places the crown on his head is doomed to die within a year. This legend is supported by a rumor that Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi governor of the puppet state Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia secretly wore them, and was assassinated less than a year later by the Czech resistance. ==Gallery== Svatovaclavsky mec.JPG|St. Wenceslas's Sword and one of the keys to jewel chamber Korunni komora dvere.JPG|The door in the St. Vitus Cathedral CZ-Prag-hrad-koenigsp-kronjuw.jpg|Reproductions of the Bohemian Crown Jewels CrownJewelsBohemiareproduction.jpg|little reproductions of the Bohemian Crown Jewels CrownBohemia3.jpg|Crown of St. Wenceslas CrownJewelsSceptreBohemia.jpg|Royal sceptre of Bohemia CrownJewelsOrbBohemia.jpg|Royal orb of Bohemia ==Exhibitions== Crown jewels are exhibited only on special occasions.

Hebbard briefly worked as a draftsman and assistant for the firm, Burnham and Root in Chicago, and in 1888 for Curlett, Eisen & Cuthbertson in Los Angeles. By 1890 he was in private practice in San Diego. In 1891, he became associated with the Reid Brothers firm, noted designers of Hotel Del Coronado and took over their San Diego projects when that firm moved to San Francisco. In 1898, he formed a well known partnership with Irving Gill. The Hebbard & Gill firm arguably produced San Diego's best architecture until its breakup in 1907. Hebbard produced work in an eclectic variety of styles, including Richarsonian Romantic, Mission Revival, Arts and Crafts, Tudor Revival and Cubist Modern, He is most regarded for his designs for private residences, but did good work on commercial structures.

The word leukodystrophy comes from the Greek roots leuko, \\"white\\", dys, \\"abnormal\\" and troph, \\"growth\\". The leukodystrophies are caused by imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty insulating covering around nerve fibers. Leukodystrophies may be classified as hypomyelinating or demyelinating diseases, depending on whether the damage is present before birth or occurs after. Other demyelinating diseases are usually not congenital and have a toxic or autoimmune cause. When damage occurs to white matter, immune responses can lead to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), along with loss of myelin. The degeneration of white matter can be seen in an MRI scan and used to diagnose leukodystrophy. Leukodystrophy is characterized by specific symptoms including decreased motor function, muscle rigidity, and eventual degeneration of sight and hearing. While the disease is fatal, the age of onset is a key factor, as infants have a typical life expectancy of 2‚Äì8 years, while adults typically live more than a decade after onset. Treatment options are limited, although hematopoietic stem cell transplantations using bone marrow or cord blood seem to help in certain types while further research is being done. The combined incidence of the leukodystrophies is estimated at 1 in 7,600. The majority of types involve the inheritance of an X-linked recessive, or X-linked dominant trait, while others, although involving a defective gene, are the result of spontaneous mutation rather than genetic inheritance. ==Symptoms and signs== Some specific symptoms vary from one type of leukodystrophy to the next, but the vast majority of symptoms are shared as the causes for the disease generally have the same effects. Symptoms are dependent on the age of onset, which is predominantly in infancy and early childhood, although the exact time of onset may be difficult to determine. Hyperirritability and hypersensitivity to the environment are common, as well as some tell-tale physical signs including muscle rigidity and a backwards- bent head. Botox therapy is often used to treat patients with spasticity. Juvenile and adult onsets display similar symptoms including a decrease or loss in hearing and vision. While children do experience optic and auditory degeneration, the course of the disease is usually too rapid, causing death relatively quickly, whereas adults may live with these conditions for many years. In children, spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia and rapid cognitive deterioration which has been described as mental retardation. Epilepsy is commonplace for patients of all ages. More progressed patients show weakness in deglutition, leading to spastic coughing fits due to inhaled saliva. Classic symptomatic progression of juvenile X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is shown in the 1992 film, Lorenzo's Oil.. Course and timetable are dependent on the age of onset with infants showing a lifespan of 2‚Äì8 years, juveniles 2‚Äì10 years and adults typically 10+ years. Adults typically see an extended period of stability followed by a decline to a vegetative state and death. While treatments do exist, most are in the experimental phase and can only promise a halt in the progression of symptoms, although some gene therapies have shown some symptomatic improvement. The debilitating course of the disease has led to numerous philosophical and ethical arguments over experimental clinical trials, patients‚Äô rights and physician-assisted suicide. ==Causes== While the more specific underlying causes of leukodystrophy are dependent upon the type, there are, however, common pathophysiological patterns that can be seen amongst all types. First and foremost, leukodystrophy is a neurodegenerative disease that is always the result of both impairment and maintenance of myelin sheaths surrounding neuronal axons in the central nervous system as the result of a genetic mutation. Myelin is a fatty white substance that acts as an electrical insulator and coats axons in order to speed up impulses (i.e., action potentials) traveling down the axon. Thus, the natural result of a loss of this substance is decreased efficiency in impulse propagation. As myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes (a type of glial cell) in the central nervous system, an easy place to look for the cause is a mutation or malfunctioning of these cells and in other glial cells. ===Genetic influence=== Autorecessive Inheritance Pattern Leukodystrophy is most often an inherited disease that is usually the result of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although dominant inheritance patterns are not unheard of, as in the case of adult- onset leukodystrophy. This means that the affected allele is carried on an autosomal, or non-sex, chromosome and is masked by the dominant, unaffected phenotype. In other words, for an individual to inherit the leukodystrophy phenotype, he or she must carry two of the recessive, mutant alleles. Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) are two of such type. MLD is found on human chromosome 22 at position q13.31. Another type of inherited leukodystrophy is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). As its name implies, this type of leukodystrophy is the result of a mutation found on the X-chromosome. It is also carried in a recessive pattern. The X chromosome is a sex chromosome, and since women have two ‚Äúchances‚Äù of acquiring a normal X chromosome (one maternal, one paternal), and males only one (one maternal), this disease is more likely to be seen in men than in women. The mutation resulting in adult-onset leukodystrophy is mapped at 5q23. ==Pathophysiology== Although there are nearly forty different types of leukodystrophies, many are lacking in formal and comprehensive research. Most of the research so far has been done on five types: (1) metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), (2) Krabbe disease, (3) X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), (4) Canavan disease, and (5) Alexander disease. Each type of leukodystrophy has a unique pathophysiology, but all five of these in some way affect a subset of glial cells, therefore disrupting myelin production and maintenance, and usually involve a mutation involving genes that code for enzymes necessary for the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that are toxic to the myelin-producing cells of the central nervous system. ===Metachromatic leukodystrophy=== Metachromatic leukodystrophy is the result of genetic defects in the enzymes associated with the cellular compartment the lysosome. MLD is one of two leukodystophies that are also a lysosomal storage disorder. MLD is inherited in an autosomal recessive way and is the result of mutations in three different ARSA alleles that encode the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ASA or sometimes ARSA), also called sulfatide sulfatase. ASA is responsible for the breakdown of sulfatides, sphingolipids present in neuronal membranes as well as in myelin. When there is a mutation in the gene that encodes ASA, the result is it decreases production, which subsequently leads to diminished degradation of sulfatides, thus causing them to accumulate. This accumulation of sulfatides is poisonous to oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS, effectively leading to a disturbance in myelin structure followed by demyelination. The pattern of inheritance of the three different alleles affects what type of MLD a person develops. Two null alleles are responsible for the infantile version, and do not allow for any production of ASA. A heterozygous individual (one null allele, one non-null allele) develops the juvenile form and sees some production of ASA, while an individual with two non-null alleles (but still mutated) develops the adult form. ===Krabbe disease=== Globoid cell leukodystrophy PAS - Multinucleated macrophages (\\"globoid cells\\") and loss of myelinated fibers in a case of Krabbe's leukodystrophy Like MLD, Krabbe disease is another type of leukodystrophy with autosomal recessive inheritance that is the result of a lysosomal storage disorder. It is due to a deletion in exon 16 of the GALC gene that causes a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. The GALC gene, found on chromosome 14 at position 31 (14q31), codes for the enzyme beta- galactocerebrosidase (GALC). GALC is a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the catabolism of galactolipids, especially psychosine, that are heavily distributed throughout the brain. A deficiency in GALC thus causes a buildup of these fatty acids known as globoid macrophages that destroy oligodendrocytes, thereby inhibiting myelin formation. Because of the presence of globoid cells clustered near white matter, Krabbe disease often goes by the name globoid cell leukodystrophy. Furthermore, new research has shown that Krabbe disease and globoid cell leukodystrophy may be distinct disease entities due to the secretion of inflammatory mediators by natural killer cells in some cases. This research has shown that Natural Killer cells have receptors (TDAG8) for certain glycosphingolipids that build up in an individual with leukodystrophy, again due to insufficient GALC levels, and when bound, target the Natural Killer cells for destruction thereby preventing their cytotoxic effects. These sphingolipids have been identified as galactosyl sphingosine and glycosyl sphingosine and are not present in unaffected individuals. ===Canavan disease=== Canavan disease is a lesser- studied type of leukodystrophy that, like MLD and Krabbe disease, is also passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. It is due to a mutation in the ASPA gene that encodes aspartoacylase, an enzyme needed to metabolize N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA). The mutation causes a deficiency of aspartoacyclase. NAA is involved in the formation of lipids, and if it is not broken down by aspartoacylase, excess levels of it build up causing demyelination. ===X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy=== In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a mutation occurs in the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC transporter). This leads to cerebral inflammatory demyelination caused by the myelin destabilization that occurs in these patients. The inflammatory demyelination begins in the corpus callosum and it slowly progresses outwards towards both hemispheres. In X-ALD patients, abnormally high levels of very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) accumulate in various body tissues and fluids. This increased concentration then incorporates into various complex lipids where they are not normally found. This has been found to be directly involved in the cerebral inflammation. The accumulated and embedded VLCFA in the complex lipids could lead to the destabilization of myelin sheath and eventually to demyelination. ===Alexander disease=== Alexander disease is unique from the leukodystrophies mentioned above in that it is the result of spontaneous mutation, that is it is not inherited. This means that the mutation found in the affected individual is not found in either of his or her parents. It is due to the accumulation of Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as the result of a mutation in the GFAP gene; which, rather than being found in association with lysosomes or peroxisomes, is an intermediate filament linked to the nuclear envelope. Intermediate filaments are proteins responsible for the makeup of the cellular cytoskeleton, and thus this type of mutation is involved in malfunctioning structural development of the cells. In fact, cytoskeletal and transporter molecule defects have been observed in the astrocytes (type of glial cell) of affected individuals. These astrocytes have an unhealthily large amount of GFAP that affects astrocyte formation and function. ==Diagnosis== The degeneration of white matter, which shows the degeneration of myelin, can be seen in a basic MRI and used to diagnose leukodystrophies of all types. T-1 and T-2 weighted FLAIR images are the most useful. FLAIR stands for fluid- attenuated inversion recovery. Electrophysiological and other kinds of laboratory testing can also be done. In particular, nerve conduction velocity is looked at to distinguish between leukodystrophy and other demyelinating diseases, as well as to distinguish between individual leukodystrophies. For example, individuals with X-ALD have normal conduction velocities, while those with Krabbe disease or metachromatic leukodystrophy have abnormalities in their conduction velocities. Next generation multigene sequencing panels for undifferentiated leukodystrophy can now be offered for rapid molecular diagnosis after appropriate genetic counselling. ===Types=== Specific types of leukodystrophies include the following with their respective ICD-10 codes when available: * (E71.3) Adrenomyeloneuropathy * (E75.2) Alexander disease * (E75.5) Cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis * Hereditary CNS demyelinating disease ** (E75.2) Krabbe disease ** (E75.2) Metachromatic leukodystrophy ** (E75.2) Pelizaeus‚ÄìMerzbacher disease ** (E75.2) Canavan disease ** (E75.2) Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy type 7 (4H syndrome) ** (G93.49) Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter ** (E71.3) Adrenoleukodystrophy * (G60.1) Refsum disease ==Treatment== With many different types of leukodystrophies and causes, treatment therapies vary for each type. Many studies and clinical trials are in progress to find treatment and therapies for each of the different leukodystrophies. Stem cell transplants and gene therapy appear to be the most promising in treating all leukodystrophies providing it is done as early as possible. For hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, therapeutic research into cell-based therapies appears promising. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells and neural stem cells have been transplanted successfully and have shown to be healthy a year later. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity maps showed possible myelination in the region of the transplant. Induced pluripotent stem cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, gene correction, and transplantation to promote the maturation, survival, and myelination of oligodendrocytes seem to be the primary routes for possible treatments. For three types of leukodystrophies (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe Disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy - GLD), gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells to transfer the disease gene with lentiviral vectors have shown to be successful and are currently being used in clinical trials for X-ALD and MLD. The progression of X-ALD has shown to be disrupted with hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy but the exact reason why demyelination stops and the amount of stem cells needed is unclear. While there is an accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in the brain, it does not seem to be the reason behind the disease as gene therapy does not correct it. Adeno-associated vectors have also been used in intracerebral injections to treat MLD. In some patients with MLD, their IQ increased, nerve conduction improved, their MRIs appeared stable, and had normal enzyme levels. Although the greater majority of patients seem to improve after the transplant, some do not respond well to treatment, which may cause devastating outcomes. For those leukodystrophies that result from a deficiency of lysozyme enzymes, such as Krabbe disease, enzyme replacement therapy seems hopeful. However, enzyme delivery proves difficult, because the blood-brain barrier severely limits what can pass into the central nervous system. Due to this obstacle, most research and clinical trials are turning to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. ==Epidemiology== X-linked Recessive Inheritance Currently, no research has shown a higher prevalence of most leukodsytrophy types in any one place around the world. There is, however, a higher prevalence of the Canavan disease in the Jewish population. 1 in 40 individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are carriers of Canavan disease. This estimates to roughly 2.5%. Additionally, due to an autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, there is no significant difference found between affected males and affected females for most types of leukodystrophy including, but not limited to, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Canavan disease, and Alexander disease. The one exception to this is any type of leukodystrophy carried on a sex chromosome, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which is carried on the X-chromosome. Because of the inheritance pattern of X-linked diseases, males are more often affected by this type of leukodystrophy, although female carriers are often symptomatic, though not as severely so as males. To date, there have been no found cases of a leukodystrophy carried on the Y chromosome. ==Current research== In addition, many research groups are studying the cellular processes of myelination, which may provide insights into leukodystrophy. Researchers in New York have successfully cured leukodystrophy in mice, using skin cells to repair damaged myelin sheaths. Researchers hypothesize that this treatment may possibly be used in curing human multiple sclerosis. ==Society== Cure MLD is a global network of patient advocates and nonprofits dedicated to helping families impacted by metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).

Also known as the Republic of Vietnam Technical Service Honors Medal, the Technical Service Medal was bestowed in two classes, one for issuance to commissioned officers and the other class for warrant officers and enlisted personnel. The award appeared as a propellered disc suspended from a blue-grey ribbon. The second class version contained two vertical red lines while the first class medal displayed an additional set of thin red lines down the center of the award ribbon. The award of the Technical Service Medal was open to both civilians and military personnel who had performed duties ‚Äúas technicians or of a technical nature‚Äù and had demonstrated ‚Äúoutstanding professional capacity, initiative, and devotion to duty‚Äù. The decoration was therefore a ‚Äúbehind-the-lines‚Äù type of award, mainly awarded to those who were engaged in support and upkeep duties for units deployed to the front lines of the Vietnam War. The two classes of the Vietnam Technical Service Medal were denoted by a slight variation in the award's ribbon bar, with the suspension medal for the decoration identical in both cases. The Vietnam Technical Service Medal was occasionally bestowed to foreigners, but not to the extent as other well known Vietnamese awards such as the Vietnam Gallantry Cross, Civil Actions Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. The Vietnam Technical Service Medal became obsolete upon the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. The award is today only available from private dealers in military insignia. ==References== * ==External links== *Military Orders, Decorations, and Medals of the Republic of Vietnam Category:Military awards and decorations of Vietnam Category:Awards established in 1964 Category:1972 disestablishments in South Vietnam ","title":"Technical Service Medal"},{"id":"1997091","text":"Scott Michael Cutler is an American songwriter, musician, record producer, and music executive.

Born in Durban, South Africa, to English parents, he can play in both prop positions, and most of his England appearances were at tighthead. In 2009 he was banned from the game for two years for using cocaine, following a positive drugs test. ==Early life== Stevens was born on 1 October 1982 in Durban, South Africa. He was educated at Kearsney College in KwaZulu-Natal and played his youth rugby in South Africa. He earned representative honours for Western Province, South African Universities and the Junior Springboks at Under 18 and Under 19 level, before deciding to move to England to pursue his university studies. ==Club career== He joined Bath in September 2002 and gained attention towards the end of the 2002‚Äì2003 season, making five appearances as a substitute. He put in strong performances coming off the bench for Bath early in the following season as the pack dominated all opposition. He featured in Bath's successful drive to the top of the Z√ºrich Premiership table in 2003‚Äì2004 and in March 2004 he was selected ahead of Jason Leonard as a replacement in England's Six Nations game against at Twickenham. Stevens was known for popping up in the back line during matches for Bath, and has quite a turn of pace for a front-rower. In January 2008, Stevens signed a four-year contract with Bath that would have kept him at the club until the end of the 2011‚Äì2012 season. However, on 20 January 2009 it was confirmed Stevens had failed a drug test after Bath's Heineken Cup match against Glasgow the previous month. He was withdrawn from the England 6 nations squad for the 2009 tournament and suspended by Bath RFC. He was banned from rugby for two years on 26 February 2009 after testing positive for cocaine, and on 5 March announced that he was quitting his club before they sacked him. In January 2010, it was announced that Stevens would sign for Saracens upon the completion of his ban. In his first season back, Stevens started for the Sarries side that defeated Leicester Tigers in the 2010‚Äì11 Aviva Premiership final. In February 2014, it was revealed that Stevens would return to South Africa after the conclusion of the 2013‚Äì14 English Premiership season to join the in August of that year on a two-year deal.

He soon drew the attention of the England senior team selectors and was selected for the 2004 summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He won his first two caps as a substitute in the Tests against the All Blacks but a knee injury meant he was unavailable for the test against in Brisbane. He was in the England team for the 2005 Six Nations, and was one of the better performers in England's disappointing campaign. He was selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour and featured in six games, though he did not play in any of the Test matches. During the 2006 Six Nations Championship he suffered a shoulder injury that required two operations and kept him out of the game for nearly a year; he did not return to international duty until England's mid-year tour to South Africa in June 2007. Stevens was in England's squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He played in the three warm-up games, against and and featured in all England's games during the tournament, starting in three of the pool games and coming off the bench in the other games.

He was mentored by Sharon Osbourne and reached the final only to be defeated by Eastenders star Lucy Benjamin. Due to his appearance on the show, he raised over ¬£125,000 for the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and in October 2006 he was invited to meet the statesman in Johannesburg. . He holds a BSc in politics with economics from the University of Bath. While serving his ban, Stevens worked in the coffee house he part owns with Lee Mears.

It is used for the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes (i.e. without further reduction into alkanes) and is named after its inventor Herbert Lindlar. ==Synthesis== Lindlar catalyst is commercially available but may also be prepared by the reduction of palladium chloride in a slurry of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) followed by the addition of lead acetate. A variety of other \\"catalyst poisons\\" have been used, including lead oxide and quinoline. The palladium content of the supported catalyst is usually 5% by weight. ==Catalytic properties== The catalyst is used for the hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes (i.e. without further reduction into alkanes). The lead serves to deactivate the palladium sites, further deactivation of the catalyst with quinoline or 3,6-dithia-1,8-octanediol enhances its selectivity, preventing formation of alkanes. Thus if a compound contains a double bond as well as a triple bond, only the triple bond is reduced. An example being the reduction of phenylacetylene to styrene. center Alkyne hydrogenation is stereospecific, occurring via syn addition to give the cis-alkene. For example the hydrogenation of acetylenedicarboxylic acid using Lindlar catalyst gives maleic acid rather than fumaric acid. center An example of commercial use is the organic synthesis of vitamin A which involves an alkyne reduction with the Lindlar catalyst.

The university offers undergraduate, graduate and online degrees as well as an Adult Degree Program for part-time and returning students. Concordia University Texas is affiliated with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and is a member of the Concordia University System, the nine-member association of LCMS colleges and universities. As a Lutheran university, Concordia's stated mission is to develop Christian leaders. ==History== Historic Kilian Hall Concordia was founded in 1926 as Lutheran Concordia College of Texas, a four-year high school that prepared young men for careers in ministry and teaching. The school opened with 26 students on its original site along East Avenue (now Interstate 35) on the then northern outskirts of Austin, Texas. In 1929, a two-story classroom building, later called the Music Building, and still later known as College Central, was built. Concordia was founded by members of Texas's Wendish immigrant community. The original main building, Kilian Hall, is named for the Wend John Kilian, founder of the first Texas Lutheran church associated with the LCMS and leader of a large group of Wends (also called Sorbs) who settled in the Serbin area. Today, between 10 and 15 percent of Concordia's faculty, staff and students are of Wendish heritage. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s many buildings were added to the campus, such as Hirschi Memorial Library in 1949 and Kramer Hall, the college's first fully air-conditioned classroom building, in 1950, but dedicated on February 25, 1951. Also in 1951, Concordia started using a two-year junior college curriculum. Old photograph of Concordia faculty in front of Kilian Hall Building developments on campus continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The campus built its chapel, named Birkmann Memorial Chapel, in 1952. Texas Hall, which housed dining services and faculty offices was dedicated in 1953. Studtmann Hall, an all-girl's dormitory opened in 1955. The first Beto Hall on the Concordia campus was built in 1969 and housed science labs. In the early 21st century, this building was converted into the school's mail services facility. In 1955 Concordia admitted women as students for the first time and the institution changed its name to Concordia Lutheran College in 1965. In 1969, the four-year high school program was disbanded and Concordia's curriculum expanded to four years after receiving permission to award Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1980. Concordia joined the Concordia University System (CUS) in 1993. The CUS represents the ten colleges and universities run by the LCMS. In 1995, under the leadership of President Rev. Dr. David Zersen, the name of the institution was changed to Concordia University at Austin. The Accelerated Degree Program (ADP), with sites in Austin, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio, within the College of Adult Education, was launched in 1995 to offer working adults the opportunity to earn a degree. Harms Hall, a dormitory, opened in January 2000 more than doubling campus resident capacity. The first Graduate program was developed during this period. In 2002, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, a former fighter pilot and colonel in the United States Air Force was named president of the university. In 2007, Concordia University at Austin changed its name to Concordia University Texas. In August 2008, Concordia University relocated its primary campus, moving onto more than in Northwest Austin. The city of Austin allowed the demolition of the former campus.\\"Historic Landmark Commission Regular Meeting March 26, 2007 - 7:00 PM.\\" City of Austin. Accessed September 28, 2008. A developer bought the space with plans to construct a mixed-use development; however, the developer filed for bankruptcy in 2011. The new campus was dedicated on October 26, 2008. ==New campus== In 2005, the Board of Regents approved the relocation of the Concordia University Texas campus. Since its founding the school had occupied a campus near downtown Austin. The new campus is located in northwest Austin on of land. Construction began in the spring of 2007, and the new campus opened in September 2008. The site for Concordia's new campus is the former Schlumberger Austin Systems Center. The site, formerly an R&D; facility, had six buildings connected by covered walkways and encircled by a nature trail. The six buildings, named by letter A-F, while extensively renovated, retained their basic design and features, including solid oak trim, large windows, sky lights and atria. Three new structures were built prior to occupation of the new Concordia campus: student housing, a fieldhouse and a front entry/guard house. In addition to the new structures, 600 additional parking spaces and new roads were built to handle the increased traffic on the campus. In 2014, Concordia broke ground on a state-of-the-art softball field that was completed in 2016. The campus includes a nature preserve that has springs and wetlands, caves, dense trees and wildlife. A 10-A federal permit is required and only one other higher education institution carries one. The inclusion of the nature preserve allows Concordia to devote time to urban environmentalism in the Austin community. The Concordia University Nature Preserve is part of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a system of preserves in western Travis County that provides habitat for a number of rare and endangered plant and animal species such the Golden- cheeked warbler and Black-capped vireo, two rare species of songbirds that breed in Central Texas. In 2013, Dr. Thomas E. Cedel, announced his retirement from Concordia University Texas. In 2014 Former Dean of the College of Business, Dr. Don Christian was named Chief Executive Officer. ==Student body== Student Body, Fall 2017 *Total Enrollment: 2619 *Undergraduate: 1722 *Graduate: 897 ==Academics== Concordia University Texas has majors, minors, and programs of study within four colleges: Business & Communication, Nursing (accredited by the Texas Nursing Board and CCNE), Education, and Arts & Sciences. Concordia is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. ==Campus life== Some of the many clubs and organizations that students participate in are: Concordia University Texas Collegiate DECA, Concordia Outdoor Ministry, Service-Learning, Missions Club, Communication Club, Student Government & Leadership Association (SGLA), Concordia Youth Ministry Team (CYMT), Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Helping Hands, History Club, Preseminarians of CTX, Society for Human Resource Management, Psychology Book Club, Kinesiology Club, Financial Management Association, Education Club, Directors of Christian Education Club, Biology Club, Behavioral Sciences Club, Association of Computing Machinery, Academic Advising Consultants, Model Organization of American States (MOAS), Moot Court, and the Spirit Squad. The school newspaper, The Mullet, was first published in 2006, and in 2013 was renamed The Spin. The Spin is published once a month during the semester. ==Athletics== The Concordia mascot is the Tornados and the school colors are purple and gold. Concordia's intercollegiate athletic teams participate in NCAA Division III competition within the American Southwest Conference. They do not award athletic scholarships per Division III rules. The athletic programs at Concordia are: baseball, softball, men's basketball, women's basketball, cross country, golf, men's soccer, women's soccer, track and field, volleyball, tennis and athletic training. In spring 2011, \\"Purple Out\\" events were started to encourage students, staff, and the community to support athletics. On designated \\"Purple Out\\" days, everyone is encouraged to wear purple and those attending a sporting event receive purple \\"Tornado Towels\\". In 2011‚Äì2012, Concordia Texas experienced its most successful year athletically. This was accomplished by winning ASC Championships in Women's Cross Country, Women's Basketball, and Men's Baseball (second consecutive championship). There were four athletic facilities on the old campus and one off-campus. On Campus: Fascholz-Keller Field (baseball), Bartholomew Park (softball), Pharr Tennis Center, Woltman Gymnasium. Off-campus: St. Francis School (soccer). Currently, men's and women's soccer play at Round Rock Multipurpose Complex. === Basketball === In the 2011‚Äì2012 season, the Concordia University Texas' women's basketball team won the American Southwest Conference. The Concordia Men's basketball team has been coached by Stanley Bonewitz Jr. since 2004. He is a former Texas Tech basketball standout. As a player, he was named Texas \\"Mr. Basketball\\" in 1995 His father, Stanley Bonewitz Sr., recently retired as a state-championship winning coach at East Central High School in San Antonio. === Baseball === The Concordia Men's baseball team is coached by former major leaguer Tommy Boggs. Coach Boggs led the team to victory in 2011 as the ASC Conference Champions, and later to the NCAA championship tournament where they fell two games short of advancing to the College World Series. In 2012, the team recorded its best record ever and swept the ASC conference tournament to win the Conference title outright for a second consecutive year. Prior to Boggs' tenure, Mike Gardner was head coach since 1998. He retired at the end of the 2009 season as the winningest coach in school baseball history and led the team to its only appearance in the College World Series in 2002. Tornado field debuted on the new campus in February 2011 and was dedicated in April 2011. It is home to Tornado Baseball. === Other sports === Chris Randle became the first student athlete from Concordia to qualify for the NCAA track and field championship tournament. His high jump earned him a sixth-place finish in the tournament. Randle's participation marked the first time in school history that Concordia was represented at the NCAA Division III Championships in two sports during the same academic year, as the baseball team won the ASC title and won two games over nationally ranked opponents ‚Äì Linfield and Redlands ‚Äì at the West Regional. In 2009 Concordia inducted its first ever Hall of Fame class, including the 2002 baseball team that played for the NCAA Division III College World Series and Atlanta Braves reliever Scott Linebrink. In 2011, three more members were inducted: Kenneth DeBord '02, basketball; Lisa Hintz '88, volleyball & basketball and Linda Lowery, who served stints as the Athletic Director, volleyball coach and men's and women's golf coach from 1980‚Äì2008. ==Alumni== * Scott Linebrink, baseball player * Richard John Neuhaus, theologian and cultural commentator * Randy Phillips, musician, Phillips, Craig and Dean ==Photo gallery== File:Concordia University Texas Aerial.jpg|Aerial view of Concordia University's new campus in Northwest Austin.

According to their website, \\"International Libertarian projects are open to anarchist, anarcho-syndicalist, revolutionary syndicalist, and clearly anti-Statist, non-party aligned social organisations which run along libertarian principles\\". The projects mostly consisted of supporting various practical initiatives in South America such as funding printshops and communal halls, and, more broadly, the struggle against corporate globalization. Its creation was rejected by the International Workers Association, who accused the initiators of being reformist and bearing confusion and division among anarchists. Its former website has since disappeared and the network is no longer active.

The company flew piston, turboprop and jet aircraft types, and conducted flight operations from 1979 until 1990. ==History== Gulf Air Transport was founded in 1979. Initially, management planned to obtain their own operating certificate and purchase a single Convair 440 (N4815C) from Smyrna, TN-based Music City Airways. However, after an evaluation, it was then decided to buy Music City's FAA operating certificate along with their only other airplane, a Convair 340 (N3416). After changing Music City Airways name to Gulf Air Transport, management then initiated charter flight operations in support of the U.S. domestic oil and gas industry with two captains and two first officers flying the piston powered Convairs. Next, they added a former North Central Airlines Convair 580 turboprop aircraft which they purchased in Bolivia (N511GA) which was then shortly followed by their final R2800 piston powered Convair 440 (N411GA). In 1981, a Lockheed L-188 Electra (N8355C) four engine turboprop was added to the fleet. The Electra was used for oil and gas industry charters flying offshore workers between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Santa Barbara, California, and also for gambling charters to and from Lake Tahoe, California. In addition, the company was purchasing Republic Airlines Convair 580 turboprops as Republic retired these aircraft which had been previously operated by North Central Airlines as well. On April 24, 1984, Gulf Air purchased their first jet, a Boeing 727-100 (N4620) from Pan Am, which included flight crew training at the Pan Am training center. This initial B727 was followed by the acquisition of Boeing 727-200 jetliners by Gulf Air. The company added new contracts for the transportation of various college athletic teams as well as gambling junkets for the casino industry, especially to and from the Lake Tahoe area in California, and pursued other new charter opportunities as the oil and gas industry started cutting back in the early 1980s. The company opened new flight crew bases in Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston, and Detroit. Philadelphia was the largest base. The airline also flew numerous charters to such international destinations as Port-au-Prince in Haiti, British Guiana (now known as Guyana) in South America, Nassau and Freeport in the Bahamas, San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix, Aruba, Bonaire and Barbados in the Caribbean, and Canc√∫n and Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Domestic charter destinations included Las Vegas, St. Louis, Orlando, Lake Tahoe and Atlantic City as well as other destinations. Other domestic cities were served by short-term contracts or as the first stop on outbound flights including Baltimore, New York City, and Newark. One-time charter flights were operated as well, including weekend sports charters, to many international destinations including Rock Sound International Airport in the Bahamas, Cura√ßao, Grenada and Puerto Plata in the Caribbean, Bermuda and also to Europe including London, England, Helsinki, Finland, and Warsaw, Poland. By the end of 1986, Gulf Air Transport had approximately 200 full-time employees. In 1988, Gulf Air sent several Boeing 727-200 jetliners to Malta in the Mediterranean for a six-month \\"sub-service contract\\" with Air Malta. The flight attendants and pursers were Air Malta employees while the flight crews and aircraft maintenance technicians were Gulf Air Transport employees. The 727s were used to operate scheduled passenger airline service for Air Malta. ===TransOcean Airways=== Trans Ocean Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-8-63 About 1986, the company changed its name from Gulf Air Transport to Gulf Air, Inc. However, when starting European service, and due to the similarity of this name with Bahrain-based Gulf Air, the airline changed its name to TransOcean Airways. During this period, the former Gulf Air Transport, which was now a successful, privately held company, decided to go public and thus offered stock in the firm which then subsequently led to loss of managerial control of the company. Reportedly, former Capitol Air (not to be confused with Capital Airlines) and Arrow Air management personnel took the company in a different direction and added two stretched Douglas Super DC-8-63 jetlinerhttp://www.airliners.net, photo of Gulf Air Douglas DC-8-63 at Acadiana Regional Airport (ARA) from Scanair and one stretched Douglas Super DC-8-71 leased from United Airlines to the fleet. The Super DC-8-71 featured new high-bypass turbofan engines which enabled longer range operations and also produced less noise. These new managers also hired additional flight attendants to crew their new transatlantic services to Ireland, England, Italy, Finland and the Azores. However, the DC-8 jetliners were often grounded and experienced long, expensive maintenance delays that required more financial resources than TransOcean had access to. Along with a recession in the US economy in the 1980s, Trans Ocean began to lose money and by 1989 it had to seek protection from its creditors by entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company subsequently failed to turn a profit and in March 1990 all flight operations ceased with the airline then going out of business.Airlines Remembered by BI Hengi, Publisher Midland Publishing ==Fleet details== Gulf Air Transport Boeing 727-232(Adv) Piston aircraft: * 1 Convair 340 (N3416) * 1 Convair 440 (N4816C) Turboprop aircraft: * 4 Convair 580 (N4801C, N511CA, N7530U, N9067R) * 1 Lockheed L-188 Electra (N8355C) Jet aircraft: * 9 Boeing 727-100 * 3 Boeing 727-200 * 1 Douglas DC-8-61 (stretched Super DC-8) (N29U) * 2 Douglas DC-8-63 (stretched Super DC-8) (N791AL) (N792AL) * 1 Douglas DC-8-71 (stretched Super DC-8 re-engined with new high-bypass turbofan engines) (N8091U) == See also == * List of defunct airlines of the United States == References == Category:Defunct companies based in Louisiana Category:Defunct airlines of the United States Category:Airlines established in 1979 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1990 Category:Companies based in New Orleans ","title":"Gulf Air Transport"},{"id":"1997119","text":"Jutish may refer to * Jutes: the Jutish people; * Jutlandic dialect; * other things originating in, or associated with, Jutland ‚Äì a region of modern Denmark.

He was a pupil of Martin Wegelius from 1892 to 1899 in Helsinki and of Robert Fuchs from 1899 to 1901 in Vienna. ==Career== As well as composing, Melartin also taught and directed music at the Helsinki Music College, later the Helsinki Conservatory. As conductor of the Vyborg Orchestra in 1908‚Äì11, and despite chronic health problems, Melartin toured extensively (as far as North Africa and India), conducting the first performance of Gustav Mahler's music in Scandinavia, the slow movement of the Resurrection symphony in 1909.John White, Jean Christensen, Kimmo Korhonen (2002), New Music of the Nordic Countries, p.136 Although Melartin was chiefly a lyricist, the symphony was central to his musical output. He wrote six symphonies (1902‚Äì1924) and was the first Finnish composer to bear Mahler's influence. The fourth symphony uses a vocalise like that of Carl Nielsen's Sinfonia Espansiva. The fifth is a Sinfonia brevis ending in a fugue and chorale, while the sixth, harmonically more advanced than the other five, advances stepwise from a C minor first movement ‚Äì with evocations of Mahler's second symphony ‚Äì to an E-flat major finale. His musical output also includes an opera, Aino (based on the character from the Finnish national epic), a violin concerto, four string quartets, and many piano pieces. His works therefore are divided mainly into large-scale works for orchestra, and chamber pieces for much smaller groups and soloists. Despite working in the same time period as Jean Sibelius he was not influenced by the more famous composer's style, and his work has been largely overshadowed by that of Finland's most revered composer. The Juhlamarssi (Festive March) from his ballet Sleeping Beauty is the most popular wedding march in Finland. == Selected compositions == === Stage === * Aino, Opera in 2 acts, Op. 50 (1912) * Sininen helmi (The Blue Pearl), Ballet, Op. 160 (1930) * Prinsessa Ruusunen (Sleeping Beauty), incidental music, Op. 22 (1904) === Orchestral === * Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 30 No. 1 (1902) * Siikajoki, Symphonic Poem, Op. 28 (1903) * Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 No. 2 (1904) * Prinsessa Ruusunen (Sleeping Beauty), Suite from incidental music, Op. 22 (1904, 1911) * Symphony No. 3 in F major, Op. 40 (1906‚Äì07) / Score, preface in English * Traumgesicht, Symphonic Poem, Op. 70 (1910) / Score, preface in English * Patria, Symphonic Poem, Op. 72 (1911) * Marjatta, Symphonic Song for soprano and orchestra Op. 79 (1014) / Score, preface in English * Symphony No. 4 \\"Kes√§sinfonia\\" (Summer Symphony) in E major, Op. 80 (1912) / Score, preface in English * Lyric Suite No. 3 \\"Impressions de Belgique\\", EM144 (1915-1916) * Symphony No. 5 \\"Sinfonia brevis\\" in A minor, Op. 90 (1915) / Score, preface in English * Symphony No. 6, Op. 100 (1924) * Divertimento, Op. 152 (1928) * Intermezzo, Op. 147 (1929) * Sininen helmi, Suite from the ballet, Op. 160 (1930) * Symphony No. 7 \\"Sinfonia gaia\\", Op. 149 (1935‚Äì1936, part 1 ready, sketches for other parts) * Symphony No. 8, Op. 186 (1936‚Äì1937, unfinished and fragmental) * Symphony No. 9, OP. 188 (1930's, just some structural plans exist) * Concerto in D minor for violin and orchestra, Op. 60 (1913) === Chamber music === * String Quartet No. 1 in E minor, Op. 36 No. 1 (1896) * Sonata for violin and piano (1899) * String Quartet No. 2 in G minor, Op. 36 No. 2 (1900) * String Quartet No. 3 in E, Op. 36 No. 3 (1902) * String Quartet No. 4 in F, Op. 62 (1910) * Nocturne for violin and piano, Op. 64 No. 1 * Kuusi helppoa kappaletta (6 Easy Pieces) for cello (or violin) and piano, Op.121 * String Trio, Op. 133 (1927) * Sonata for flute and harp, Op. 135a (1927) * Sonata for brass, Op. 153 (1929) * Trio for flute, clarinet and bassoon, Op. 154 (1929) * Pieni kvartetto (Little Quartet) for four horns, Op. 185 === Piano === * Marionetteja (Marionnettes), Suite for piano 4 hands, Op. 1 (1899) * 2 Ballads, Op. 5 (1899) * Lastuja I (Chips I), 6 pieces, Op. 7 (1900) * 3 Pieces, Op. 8 (1899) * Lastuja II (Chips II), 6 pieces, Op. 9 (1900) * Skizzer, 5 Pieces, Op. 11 * Legend II, Op. 12 (1900) * Lastuja III (Chips III), 5 pieces, Op. 34 (1906) * Lastuja IV (Chips IV), 5 pieces, Op. 48 (1907) * Surullinen puutarha (The Melancholy Garden), 5 Pieces, Op. 52 (1908) * Lyric Pieces, Op. 59 (1909) * 4 Pieces, Op. 75 * 9 Little Pieces, Op. 76 * Album Leaves, Op. 83 * 4 Sonatinas, Op. 84 * 24 Preludes, Op. 85 (1913‚Äì20) * Noli me tangere, Op. 87 (1914) * 3 Pieces, Op. 98 (1916?) * Skuggspel, 7 Pieces, Op.104 * Fantasia apocaliptica, Op. 111 (1921) * 6 Pieces, Op. 118 (1923) : No. 2 The Mysterious Forest * 6 Pieces, Op. 123 (1924‚Äì1925) === Vocal === * 3 Songs for voice and piano, Op. 13 * Kansanlaulua K√§kisalmelta (Folk Songs from Kexholm), Op. 55 * 5 Songs for voice and piano, Op. 69 * 3 Songs for voice and piano, Op. 77 * 3 Songs for voice and piano, Op. 86 * 4 Songs for voice and piano, Op. 95 == References == == Further reading == * Pitk√§ranta, Inkeri: \\"Erkki Melartin Painter, Composer, Philosopher\\" Finnish Music Quarterly 1/2000 pp. 2‚Äì7. * * * == External links == *Erkki Melartin Society *Ondine Records Melartin Site *Musical Finland in Brussels * Song by Vilhelm Krag and Erkki Melartin *Erkki Melartin on Victor Records *O, Herre: 1918 recording by Eleonora Olson *O, Herre: lyrics by Vilhelm Krag Category:1875 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from Priozersk Category:People from Viipuri Province (Grand Duchy of Finland) Category:Finnish conductors (music) Category:Finnish classical composers Category:Finnish opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:20th- century classical composers Category:Finnish male classical composers Category:Burials at Hietaniemi cemetery Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Erkki Melartin"},{"id":"1997136","text":"Andrew Sheridan (born 1 November 1979 in Petts Wood, Bromley, England) is a retired English rugby union player who played as a loosehead prop. Sheridan is tall, which is unusually tall for a prop, and weighs . He is known for his great physical strength ‚Äì he is a near-elite class powerlifter and able to bench press and squat . Sheridan announced his retirement from rugby in September 2014, due to a series of neck injuries.https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/club- rugby/andrew-sheridan-retires-england-international-forced-to-end- career-9764182.html ==Domestic career== ===Early career=== Born on 1 November 1979 in Petts Wood, Bromley, England, Sheridan started playing rugby union at the age of nine with Old Elthamians, where he played for five years. In 1991, he went to Dulwich College and there he worked his way through the Surrey age group teams and was capped by both the England U16 and U18 Group Schools teams as a lock. He joined Richmond in the 1998‚Äì99 season and as they folded he won a place in the England U21 squad that played in the 1999 SANZAR tournament in Argentina. It was rumoured that to maintain concentration during matches he would have a jammy dodger at the half time break. ===Bristol and positional change=== On his return from the SANZAR tournament he joined Bristol Shoguns, where he made around 80 appearances. His physique also caused problems; slightly short for a lock, he was also too heavy to be lifted in the line-out (a key area of second row play), meaning that if he played there, a tall back row forward (such as Dean Ryan) had to fill in; he was also not mobile enough to play in the back row himself; as a result it was decided to switch him to loosehead prop, despite his being very tall for that position. Sheridan was switched from lock to loosehead prop by New Zealander Peter Thorburn while at Bristol. He showed his versatility by also playing at Number 8. ===Sale Sharks=== After Bristol were relegated in the 2002‚Äì03 season, Sheridan joined Sale. In his first season at Sale, Sheridan played in the final of the 2004 Powergen Cup. Sheridan started for Sale as they defeated Pau in the final of the 2004‚Äì05 European Challenge Cup. Sheridan helped Sale Sharks to top the League in the 2005‚Äì06 season. An injury sustained earlier in the season meant Sheridan could not play in the final, as Sale defeated the Leicester Tigers to become Premiership champions for the first time. ===Toulon=== In 2012, he signed for French 14 club Toulon. In May 2013 he started as Toulon won the 2013 Heineken Cup Final by 16‚Äì15 against Clermont Auvergne. ==International career== ===Early international career and debut=== In 2000 he was a squad member on England's tour to South Africa. During 2001/02 Sheridan played for England A against France A and Ireland A. In 2003 Sheridan was selected to represent England A at the 2003 Churchill Cup in Canada, as well as fixtures against the US and Japan. In December 2003, he played for the England XV that took on the Barbarians immediately following England's 2003 Rugby World Cup success. He finally won his first cap for England in November 2004, coming on as a replacement against Canada. ===2005 Lions Tour=== He was somewhat controversially selected for the 2005 Lions tour of New Zealand, as many felt with only one cap to his name he was unlikely to feature heavily. On the 2005 tour, he was sent to the sin-bin after attempting to punch Luke McAlister following a clash of heads in the game against New Zealand MƒÅori. Sheridan did not feature in the Test series. ===First start for England=== However, he established his reputation later that year in England's November Test against Australia, playing the main role in out-classing the Australian front row. Neither of his opposite numbers finished the match. First, Al Baxter proved unable to deal with Sheridan's power, and was eventually sin-binned late in the second half for collapsing a scrum after being warned for repeated scrum violations. Shortly afterwards, Matt Dunning, who was forced to move opposite Sheridan, was stretchered off after a scrum with what was feared to be a serious neck injury; however, scans showed no structural damage to Dunning's neck. Due to the sin-binning and Dunning's injury, the referee ordered uncontested scrums for the last 10 minutes of the match. He faced Carl Hayman of the All Blacks the next Saturday, who gave him a tough time at the scrum by scrumming very low, negating Sheridan's raw power. ===2006 injury=== During a 23‚Äì21 victory over South Africa on 20 November 2006, Sheridan suffered a broken right ankle and ligament damage. The injury ruled him out for the rest of the 2006/07 season. ===2007 Rugby World Cup=== He won 'Man of the match' against Australia in the Quarter final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Sheridan played the full 80 minutes in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final. ===2009 Lions Tour=== Sheridan was included in the squad for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. Sheridan played in two Tests, starting the third and final Test. ==Outside rugby== In 2010, Sheridan recorded and released an acoustic rock album, entitled \\"Where We Go From Here\\". The acoustic album features Andrew on guitar, along with piano, drum and vocal accompaniment, and was recorded at the local Cotyso Studios after Sheridan's wife contacted the owner. ==References== ==External links== England profile Category:1979 births Category:Bristol Bears players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from England Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby union players Category:Living people Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:People from Petts Wood Category:RC Toulonnais players Category:Richmond F.C. players Category:Rugby union props Category:Sale Sharks players ","title":"Andrew Sheridan"},{"id":"1997137","text":"\\"Who Needs Enemies?\\" is the third and final single released from The Cooper Temple Clause's debut album, See This Through and Leave.

It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The seat is most famous as the location of William Ewart Gladstone's upset victory in the Midlothian Campaign of 1880, regarded as the birth of the modern political campaign in the United Kingdom. After Gladstone's victory it became the first non-English constituency to be represented by a serving prime minister. ==Creation== The British parliamentary constituency was created in 1708 following the Acts of Union, 1707 and replaced the former Parliament of Scotland shire constituency of Edinburghshire. == Boundaries == As first used, in 1708 general election of the Parliament of Great Britain, the constituency covered the county of Edinburgh, except the burgh of Edinburgh, which was covered by the Edinburgh burgh constituency. 1708 boundaries were used also for all subsequent elections of that parliament. In 1801 the Parliament of Ireland was merged with the Parliament of Great Britain to form the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The first general election of the new parliament was the general election of 1802. There was no change to the boundaries of any pre-existing Westminster constituency, and 1802 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1806, 1807, 1812, 1818, 1820, 1826, 1830 and 1831. For the 1832 general election, as a result of the Representation of the People Act 1832, the constituency was redefined. The boundaries of counties and burghs for parliamentary purposes ceased to be necessarily those for other purposes, but nominally the Edinburghshire constituency consisted of the county of Edinburgh minus the burghs of Edinburgh, Leith, Portobello, and Musselburgh. Edinburgh was again covered by the Edinburgh constituency, and Leith, Portobello and Musselburgh were covered by the Leith Burghs constituency. 1832 boundaries were used also in the general elections of 1835, 1837, 1841, 1847, 1852, 1857, 1859, 1865, 1874, 1880, 1886, 1892, 1895, 1900, 1906, January 1910 and December 1910. For the 1918 general election, as a result of the Representation of the People Act 1918, the area of the Edinburghshire constituency was mostly divided between the Midlothian and Peebles Northern and Peebles and Southern Midlothian constituencies. By this date, the county of Edinburgh had been renamed as the county of Midlothian. The Midlothian and Peebles Northern constituency consisted of the Calder and Suburban districts and part of the Lasswade district of the county of Midlothian, and the Peebles and Southern constituency consisted of the county of Peebles, the Gala Water district and part of the Lasswade district of county of Midlothian, and the burghs of Bonnyrigg, Lasswade, and Penicuik in county of Midlothian.Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885-1972 (), F. W. S. Craig, 1972 The rest of the county of Midlothian was covered by the Edinburgh Central, Edinburgh East, Edinburgh North, Edinburgh South, Edinburgh West and Leith constituencies. ==History== The constituency elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system. There were 56 voters in 1708, 68 in 1710, about 80 between 1715 and 1754, 84 in 1764, 104 in 1774, 93 in 1788, 95 in 1790 rising to 123 in 1811, 174 in 1820, 168 in 1826 and 165 in 1830. The seat was redefined for the 1832 general election and replaced for the 1918 general election. ==Members of Parliament== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !colspan=\\"2\\" | Election !! Member !!

The musical setting, previously attributed to Henry Purcell, and probably for the London revival of 1712, was very probably by John Weldon. The Dryden/D'Avenant adaptation was first performed at the Duke's Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 7 November 1667, and published in 1670. It is written partly in blank verse and partly in a sort of rhythmic prose. The play was revised and revived a number of times, and adapted as an opera by Thomas Shadwell in April 1674; Shadwell's revision had a musical score created by a team of composers that included Matthew Locke and Pelham Humfrey. This was the version of The Tempest most familiar to audiences up until William Macready's enormously successful production of Shakespeare's original on 13 October 1838. Shadwell's version was revived in 1701, in 1702 through 1704, in 1706 through 1708, in 1710, in 1712 through 1717, and more than 20 times between 1729 and 1747. Dryden and D'Avenant keep a great deal of Shakespeare's verse, but generally tone the play down, simplifying grammar and language occasionally, removing much of the \\"mythic resonance\\" of the original, and adding a fair amount of their own invention. The added elements include new characters - Hippolito, a man who has never seen a woman, and Dorinda, a second daughter of Prospero. Hippolito and Dorinda, predictably, fall in love; their love parallels that between Miranda, Shakespeare's maiden who has never seen a man, and Ferdinand, son to the Duke of Mantua (or to the King of Naples in Shakespeare's version). Ariel was given an ethereal girlfriend in Milcha (Shadwell expanded her role in 1674). Even Caliban got a sister. Shadwell's 1674 operatic version of Dryden and D'Avenant's adaptation was mocked by Thomas Duffet in his farce The Mock Tempest, or the Enchanted Castle, also in 1674. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1667 plays Category:English Restoration plays Dryden Category:Plays by John Dryden Category:Plays by William Davenant ","title":"The Tempest (Dryden and D'Avenant play)"},{"id":"1997155","text":"The Zarumilla River is a river in South America that marks the border between Peru and Ecuador. It is named after the Peruvian town of Zarumilla. View of the river; the boats are on Ecuadorian territory, while the Peruvian side of the border (to the right) is uninhabited It is part of the Gulf of Guayaquil- Tumbes mangroves Sanctuary and its currents, sediments, and tides strongly influence the geomorphology of the area. It empties into the Gulf of Guayaquil. The largest towns on its banks are Huaquillas, in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, and Aguas Verdes in the Tumbes Region of Peru; both towns are connected by an international bridge. The water flows through a canal as the river passes these populated areas. Pollution is a problem in this part of the river, as people from both countries discharge their waste into the canal. ==Border issues== In 1998, during El Ni√±o, the river changed its course, moving 1 square kilometre of land into its eastern margin. Ecuadorians took advantage of this situation, saying that the river is the natural border marker and therefore gives them rights in the affected area. The Peruvians argued that the area is sovereign Peruvian soil.

The reaction is analogous to the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome bc1 (Complex III) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. During photosynthesis, the cytochrome b6f complex is one step along the chain that transfers electrons from Photosystem II to Photosystem I, and at the same time pumps protons into the thylakoid space that contribute to create an electrochemical (energy) gradient which is later used to synthesize ATP from ADP. == Enzyme structure == The cytochrome b6f complex is a dimer, with each monomer composed of eight subunits. These consist of four large subunits: a 32 kDa cytochrome f with a c-type cytochrome, a 25 kDa cytochrome b6 with a low- and high-potential heme group, a 19 kDa Rieske iron-sulfur protein containing a [2Fe-2S] cluster, and a 17 kDa subunit IV; along with four small subunits (3-4 kDa): PetG, PetL, PetM, and PetN. The total molecular weight is 217 kDa. The crystal structure of cytochrome b6f complexes from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Mastigocladus laminosus, and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 have been determined. The core of the complex is structurally similar to cytochrome bc1 core. Cytochrome b6 and subunit IV are homologous to cytochrome b and the Rieske iron-sulfur proteins of the two complexes are homologous. However, cytochrome f and cytochrome c1 are not homologous. Cytochrome b6f contains seven prosthetic groups. Four are found in both cytochrome b6f and bc1: the c-type heme of cytochrome c1 and f, the two b-type hemes (bp and bn) in bc1 and b6f, and the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the Rieske protein. Three unique prosthetic groups are found in cytochrome b6f: chlorophyll a, Œ≤-carotene, and heme cn (also known as heme x). The inter-monomer space within the core of the cytochrome b6f complex dimer is occupied by lipids, which provides directionality to heme-heme electron transfer through modulation of the intra- protein dielectric environment. == Biological function == Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cytochrome b6f mutant (right) next to normal plant. Plants are used in photosynthesis research to investigate the cyclic photophosphorylation. In photosynthesis, the cytochrome b6f complex functions to mediate the transfer of electrons between the two photosynthetic reaction center complexes, from Photosystem II to Photosystem I, while transferring protons from the chloroplast stroma across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. Electron transport via cytochrome b6f is responsible for creating the proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP in chloroplasts. In a separate reaction, the cytochrome b6f complex plays a central role in cyclic photophosphorylation, when NADP+ is not available to accept electrons from reduced ferredoxin. This cycle results in the creation of a proton gradient by cytochrome b6f, which can be used to drive ATP synthesis. It has also been shown that this cycle is essential for photosynthesis, in which it is proposed to help maintain the proper ratio of ATP/NADPH production for carbon fixation. The p-side quinol deprotonation-oxidation reactions within the cytochrome b6f complex have been implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species. An integral chlorophyll molecule located within the quinol oxidation site has been suggested to perform a structural, non-photochemical function in enhancing the rate of formation of the reactive oxygen species, possibly to provide a redox- pathway for intra-cellular communication. ==Reaction mechanism== The cytochrome b6f complex is responsible for \\"non-cyclic\\" (1) and \\"cyclic\\" (2) electron transfer between two mobile redox carriers, plastoquinone (QH2) and plastocyanin (Pc): {| style=\\"margin:auto; width:45em; text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;\\" |- | H2O | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:lightgreen\\" | photosystem II | ‚Üí | QH2 | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:pink\\" | Cyt b6f | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:lightblue\\" | Pc | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:yellow\\" | photosystem I | ‚Üí | style=\\"text-align:left\\" | NADPH | style=\\"text-align:right\\" | (1) |- | colspan=4 | | QH2 | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:pink\\" | Cyt b6f | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:lightblue\\" | Pc | ‚Üí | style=\\"background:yellow\\" | photosystem I | ‚Üí | style=\\"text-align:left\\" | Q | style=\\"text-align:right\\" | (2) |} Cytochrome b6f catalyzes the transfer of electrons from plastoquinol to plastocyanin, while pumping two protons from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen: :QH2 \\\\+ 2Pc(Cu2+) + 2H+ (stroma) ‚Üí Q + 2Pc(Cu+) + 4H+ (lumen) This reaction occurs through the Q cycle as in Complex III. Plastoquinone acts as the electron carrier, transferring its two electrons to high- and low-potential electron transport chains (ETC) via a mechanism called electron bifurcation. The complex contains up to three natively plastoquinone (PQ) molecules that forms an electron transfer network that are responsible for the operation of the Q cycle and its redox-sensing and catalytic functions in photosynthesis. ===Q cycle=== Q cycle of cytochrome b6f First half of Q cycle # QH2 binds to the positive 'p' side (lumen side) of the complex. It is oxidized to a semiquinone (SQ) by the iron-sulfur center (high-potential ETC) and releases two protons to the thylakoid lumen. # The reduced iron-sulfur center transfers its electron through cytochrome f to Pc. # In the low-potential ETC, SQ transfers its electron to heme bp of cytochrome b6. # Heme bp then transfers the electron to heme bn. # Heme bn reduces Q with one electron to form SQ. Second half of Q cycle # A second QH2 binds to the complex. # In the high- potential ETC, one electron reduces another oxidized Pc. # In the low- potential ETC, the electron from heme bn is transferred to SQ, and the completely reduced Q2‚àí takes up two protons from the stroma to form QH2. # The oxidized Q and the reduced QH2 that has been regenerated diffuse into the membrane. ===Cyclic electron transfer=== In contrast to Complex III, cytochrome b6f catalyzes another electron transfer reaction that is central to cyclic photophosphorylation. The electron from ferredoxin (Fd) is transferred to plastoquinone and then the cytochrome b6f complex to reduce plastocyanin, which is reoxidized by P700 in Photosystem I. The exact mechanism for how plastoquinone is reduced by ferredoxin is still under investigation. One proposal is that there exists a ferredoxin:plastoquinone-reductase or an NADP dehydrogenase. Since heme x does not appear to be required for the Q cycle and is not found in Complex III, it has been proposed that it is used for cyclic photophosphorylation by the following mechanism: # Fd (red) + heme x (ox) ‚Üí Fd (ox) + heme x (red) # heme x (red) + Fd (red) + Q + 2H+ ‚Üí heme x (ox) + Fd (ox) + QH2 == References == == External links == * Structure-Function Studies of the Cytochrome b6f Complex - Current research on cytochrome b6f in William Cramer's Lab at Purdue University, USA * - Calculated positions of b6f and related complexes in membranes * Category:Hemoproteins Category:Iron-sulfur proteins Category:Light reactions Category:Integral membrane proteins Category:EC 1.10.99 ","title":"Cytochrome b6f complex"},{"id":"1997184","text":"Gene Alec Littler (July 21, 1930 ‚Äì February 15, 2019) was an American professional golfer and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. Known for a solid temperament and nicknamed \\"Gene the Machine\\" for his smooth rhythmical swing, he once said that, \\"Golf is not a game of great shots. It's a game of the best misses. The people who win make the smallest mistakes.\\" ==Early years and amateur career== Littler was born in San Diego, California. He played on the 1953 United States Walker Cup team, and won the U.S. Amateur and the California State Amateur that same year. In 1954, he won a PGA Tour event as an amateur, a rare achievement which was not to be repeated until Doug Sanders won the Canadian Open in 1956. Littler graduated from San Diego State University, and after that served in the United States Navy from 1951 to 1954. ==Professional career== Gene Littler with family in 1956 An early highlight of Littler's professional playing career was a second-place finish at the 1954 U.S. Open. He finished one shot behind Ed Furgol. In 1955, he won four times on the tour, but fell into a slump in the late 1950s after tinkering with his swing. In 1959 after taking advice he received from Paul Runyan and adjusting his grip, he recovered to have his best year with five PGA Tour victories. He finished second on the money list that year, which was to remain his career best. Only once from 1954 to 1979 did Littler finish out of the top 60 on the final money list. He was stricken with melanoma cancer found in a lymph node under his left arm in 1972, but came back to win five more times on the PGA Tour. He ended his career with 29 PGA Tour wins, and also won two tournaments in Japan and one in Australia. One of Littler's 29 PGA Tour wins was unique. When he won the 1975 Bing Crosby National Pro-Am, it marked the first and (so far) only time that a player won that event as a professional after having previously won the pro-amateur portion, which Littler did as a 23-year-old amateur in 1954. Littler won one major championship ‚Äì the 1961 U.S. Open. He shot a 68 in the final round to overtake Doug Sanders. He accumulated 17 top-10 finishes in the three U.S.-based majors: seven at the Masters Tournament, five at the PGA Championship, and five at the U.S. Open. In addition to his U.S. Open victory, he had one second-place finish in each of the three U.S. majors, losing playoffs to Billy Casper at the 1970 Masters and to Lanny Wadkins at the 1977 PGA Championship. The latter was the first ever sudden-death playoff in a major. He was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup teams of 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1971 and 1975, and had a 14-5-8 win/loss/tie record including five wins and three ties in 10 singles matches. Littler received the Ben Hogan Award in 1973 for a courageous comeback from injury or illness, after returning to the tour following treatment for malignant melanoma. Also in 1973, he was given the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf. In the 1980s and 1990s Littler played on the Senior PGA Tour, winning eight times.

Casting at an iron foundry: From Fra Burmeister og Wain's Iron Foundry, 1885 by Peder Severin Kr√∏yer An ironworks or iron works is an industrial plant where iron is smelted and where heavy iron and steel products are made. The term is both singular and plural, i.e. the singular of ironworks is ironworks. Ironworks succeed bloomeries when blast furnaces replaced former methods. An integrated ironworks in the 19th century usually included one or more blast furnaces and a number of puddling furnaces or a foundry with or without other kinds of ironworks. After the invention of the Bessemer process, converters became widespread, and the appellation steelworks replaced ironworks. The processes carried at ironworks are usually described as ferrous metallurgy, but the term siderurgy is also occasionally used. This is derived from the Greek words sideros - iron and ergon or ergos - work. This is an unusual term in English, and it is best regarded as an anglicisation of a term used in French, Spanish, and other Romance languages. ==Varieties of ironworks== ===Primary ironmaking=== A South Wales iron mill in 1798 Blast furnaces of T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works. Toronto rolling mills Ironworks is used as an omnibus term covering works undertaking one or more iron-producing processes. Such processes or species of ironworks where they were undertaken include the following: *Blast furnaces ‚Äî which made pig iron (or sometimes finished cast iron goods) from iron ore; *Bloomeries ‚Äî where bar iron was produced from iron ore by direct reduction; * Electrolytic smelting ‚Äî Employs a chromium/iron anode that can survive a to produce decarbonized iron and 2/3 of a ton of industrial-quality oxygen per ton of iron. A thin film of metal oxide forms on the anode in the intense heat. The oxide forms a protective layer that prevents excess consumption of the base metal. *Finery forges ‚Äî which fined pig iron to produce bar iron, using charcoal as fuel in a finery (hearth) and coal or charcoal in a chafery (hearth); *Foundries ‚Äî where pig iron was remelted in an air furnace or in a foundry cupola to produce cast iron goods; *Potting and stamping forges with melting fineries using the first process in which bar iron was made from pig iron with mineral coal or coke, without the use of charcoal; *Puddling furnaces ‚Äî a later process for the same purpose, again with coke as fuel. It was usually necessary for there to be a preliminary refining process in a coke refinery (also called running out furnace). After puddling, the puddled ball needed shingling and then to be drawn out into bar iron in a rolling mill. ===Modern steelmaking=== From the 1850s, pig iron might be partly decarburised to produce mild steel using one of the following: * The Bessemer process in a Bessemer converter, improved by the Gilchrist-Thomas process; * The Siemens-Martin process in an Open hearth furnace; * Electric arc furnace, introduced in 1907; * Basic oxygen steelmaking, introduced in 1952. The mills operating converters of any type are better called steelworks, ironworks referring to former processes, like puddling. ===Further processing=== After bar iron had been produced in a finery forge or in the forge train of a rolling mill, it might undergo further processes in one of the following: *A slitting mill - which cut a flat bar into rod iron suitable for making into nails. *A tinplate works - where rolling mills made sheets of iron (later of steel), which were coated with tin. *A plating forge with a tilt hammer, a lighter hammer with a rapid stroke rate, enabling the production of thinner iron, suitable for the manufacture of knives, other cutlery, and so on. *A cementation furnace might be used to convert the bar iron (if it was pure enough) into blister steel by the cementation process, either as an end in itself or as the raw material for crucible steel. ===Manufacture=== Most of these processes did not produce finished goods. Further processes were often manual, including *Manufacturing by blacksmiths or more specialist kind of smith. *It might be used in shipbuilding.

Their main divisions are Alias Comics (all-ages comic books) and Cross Culture (Christian comic books). Based in San Diego, California, it was founded in January 2005 by Brett Burner and Mike S. Miller. They publish comics such as Lullaby, The 10th Muse, The Legend of Isis, and Sixgun Samurai. ==History== Alias was founded by artist Mike S. Miller and publisher Brett Burner (also owner of Lamp Post PublicationsLamp Post Publications ). In January 2005, they launched their first productions through Image Comics filling a virtually untapped market with three all-ages titles: Lullaby: Wisdom Seeker, Lions, Tigers and Bears, and The Imaginaries. All three were successful projects in the independent marketplace, particularly Lullaby, which has seen continuing success since its initial release. Also in 2005, Alias expanded into a self-publishing company with plans to launch 12 titles in April of that year with cover prices of 75 cents. The titles all shipped late and were released irregularly afterwards, but landed them a spot with Diamond Comic Distributors as a Top 20 Publisher. Alias Comics offered 25-cent preview issues, 75-cent introductory issues, and 50,000 copies of free (to retailer) preview books called \\"the Comic Book Digest\\" as marketing efforts, but continued to have problems with shipping. In mid-2005, Alias chose to move its comic printing stateside, but due to the accumulation of problems at the domestic printer, decided to go back to its original partner in South Korea. The subsequent lapse in shipping, going from a domestic printer to a South Korean printer, resulted in a two- to three- month lapse in delivery of Alias comic books to comic stores. Being gone from the shelves for so long created several problems for the fledgling company, causing a loss of retailer and consumer confidence. Nearly a year after opening their doors, several Alias comic book creators began to leave the publisher, citing various concerns. In 2005, studios Monkey Pharmacy, Runemaster Studios, and Dabel Brothers Productions stopped producing books for publication by Alias. In November, Alias underwent a restructuring plan. Its publisher, Brett Burner, purchased majority shares of the company in order to take control of the company's financial records. In March 2006, Alias announced a new policy toward its creators requiring work to be completed and in-hand before being solicited for publication, citing an effort to maintain a more exact release schedule. Later, Alias signed an agreement with Christian publisher Zondervan to produce 24 manga or graphic novels to be released over the next few years through its Cross Culture division, consisting of three 8-book series. These titles included Hand of the Morningstar, Kingdoms, and The Manga Bible. Also in 2006, Alias' Christian division, Cross Culture Entertainment, began publication of Bubblemag, a Christian pop culture magazine.Bubblemag In Fall 2006, Alias executives announced their intention to rebrand Alias Comics as a Christian comic company. Within a few weeks, Abacus Comics opened for business. Abacus Comics is owned solely by Miller, and was opened for the express purpose of publishing several of his \\"creator- owned\\" titles which were initially run through Alias Comics. In 2007, Lamp Post Inc. obtained full rights to all Alias and Cross Culture properties, placing them under its label. ==Publications== In alphabetical order: * ArmorQuest: Genesis (2005‚Äì2006) by Ben Avery and Sherwin Schwartzrock * Atomik Mike (2006) by Stephan Nilson * The Blackbeard Legacy (2006‚Äì2007) * Chrono Mechanics (2006) by Art Thibert and Richard Birdsall * David: The Sheperd's Song (2005) by Royden Lepp * David's Mighty Men (2005) by Javier Saltares * Deal with the Devil (2005) by Mike S.

The name has been translated to mean \\"the fiery chamber.\\" ==Institution== Special courts designated for the exclusive trials of heretics in France were first instituted in the Parlement de Rouen on April 17, 1545. At that time approximately two years before the death of Francis in March of 1547, the number of heretics in prisons in Normandy awaiting trial was so great that the prisons could barely contain them. To remedy the situation, Francis \\"authorized the erection in the Parliament of Rouen of a special chamber, consisting of ten or twelve of the most learned and zealous judges, to take cognizance of the crime of heresy to the exclusion of all other employments\\". Approximately two years later when Francis died and Henry II took the throne, he deemed the special courts in Rouen as a successful experiment and instituted similar courts \\"upon a larger scale in the highest court of the realm, the Parlement of Paris. The members of the new commission were selected from among the parliamentary counselors who were removed from any suspicion of heresy and known to be active in the prosecution of offenses against 'mother holy Church. It is believed that this special court in Paris was instituted sometime between December 1547 and May 1548. ==Reputation== This special court ultimately came to have a reputation of \\"sending to the flames as many as fell into its hands\\" and gained the unofficial designation of \\"la chambre ardente\\". Despite its reputation, an examination of 323 case histories pertaining to individuals on trial during a twenty-three-month time period from May 1548 to March 1550 reveals that many of those arrested and put on trial for heresy escaped a dire punishment. Of the 323 cases examined, approximately two-thirds of the cases had come to a final verdict. Of the sentences pronounced, 39 individuals were able to vindicate themselves and were set free with only an injunction that they live \\"as good Christians in the holy Catholic faith\\". The punishment associated with 142 cases was meaning an \\"honorable penalty\\". The \\"penalties\\" in these cases were fairly mild and included fines, public ceremonies of penance, banishments, and beatings with warnings never to engage in heresy again. And finally, 37 sentences of death were pronounced of which 6 individuals were put to death by fire while 31 individuals were simply hung. It is also interesting to examine the occupations of the 323 individuals on trial for heresy. Almost fifty percent of those on trial or 153 individuals were lower and middle class artisans, merchants, and small shop owners. Nearly a third of those on trial or 111 individuals were members of the clergy. 47 individuals were members of the upper class with professions such as barristers and solicitors. Twelve individuals were nobles. While it might appear that the focus of heresy prosecution was the lower or middle class, the greatest target was clergymen as their percent of the population was less than five percent. No peasants were included among those on trial. This can likely be explained by the fact that the Protestant theology as taught by John Calvin and other reformers was unattractive to peasants. The ideas and beliefs of the Protestant theology were alien. The Protestant theology was a \\"religion of the book\\" that made intellectual demands upon those wishing to explore and learn. The books and pamphlets espousing John Calvin's works were written in either French or Latin. Such intellectual demands were beyond the capabilities of an uneducated peasantry that could neither afford books nor read anything but the local patois that dominated the rural areas. As so, most peasants at the time retained their traditional allegiance and belief in the tenets of the Catholic Church. ==Abolishment== By an edict on November 19, 1549, Henry II relieved French judges of their duties associated with these special courts effective on January 11, 1550. The attempt to eliminate heresy with special courts had proved to be a failure and a new approach of sending heretics to the bishops and Church courts for trial was to be implemented. Three years later, the King's edict of Saint Germain en Laye on March 1, 1553 reestablished the courts. It is unclear as to how long the revived tribunals continued thereafter before permanently being abolished. ==Citations== ==References== :: :: :: :: :: Category:Legal history of the Ancien R√©gime Category:Judiciary of France Category:Defunct courts Category:1545 establishments in France Category:1550 disestablishments in France Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1545 Category:Courts and tribunals disestablished in 1550 ","title":"Chambre Ardente"},{"id":"1997209","text":"A cylinder head from a Honda K20Z3. Components of the i-VTEC system can be seen. The Honda K-series engine is a line of four-cylinder four-stroke car engine introduced in 2001. The K-series engines are equipped with DOHC valvetrains and use roller rockers to reduce friction. The engines use a coil- on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes the use of a conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B- and F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H- and newer F-series engines found only in the Honda S2000. Similar to B series, the K-series car engines have two short blocks with the same design; the only difference between them being the deck height. K20 uses the short block with a deck height of 212mm where K23 and K24 block has a deck height of 231.5mm. Two versions of the Honda i-VTEC system can be found on a K-series engine, and both versions can come with variable timing control (VTC) on the intake cam. The VTEC system on engines like the K20A3 only operate on the intake cam; at low rpm only one intake valve is fully opened, the other opening just slightly to create a swirl effect in the combustion chamber for improved fuel atomization. At high rpm, both intake valves open fully to improve engine breathing. In engines such as the K20A2 found in the Acura RSX Type-S, the VTEC system operates on both the intake and exhaust valves, allowing both to benefit from multiple cam profiles. A modified K20C engine is used in motorsport, as the Sports Car Club of America Formula 3 and 4 series that run in North America both use a K20C engine, with the Formula 4 engine not having a turbocharger. ==K20== ===K20A=== ;Applications: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

His knowledge of blues history is revealed by his use of older material and playing styles. NPR Music described him as \\"Powerful, soul- stirring, fierce and gritty...a legendary boundary-pushing icon of modern blues.\\" Another music journalist noted \\"If you define 'blues' by the rigid categories of structure rather than the flexible language of feeling allusion, Robert Cray... Larry Garner, Joe Louis Walker and James Armstrong are a new and uncategorizable breed, their music blues-like rather than blues, each of them blending ideas and devices from a variety of sources - soul, rock, jazz, gospel - with a sophisication beyond the reach of their forerunners\\". ==Career== He was born Louis Joseph Walker Jr. in San Francisco, United States. He came from a musical family, amidst the early influences of T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, Meade Lux Lewis, Amos Milburn, and Pete Johnson. Walker first picked up the guitar at the age of eight, and became a known quantity within the Bay Area music scene by the age of 16. While publicly performing through his teens, he soaked up many influences (especially vocalists such as Wilson Pickett, James Brown, Bobby Womack and Otis Redding). In these early years, Walker played with John Lee Hooker, J.J. Malone, Buddy Miles, Otis Rush, Thelonious Monk, The Soul Stirrers, Willie Dixon, Charlie Musselwhite, Steve Miller, Nick Lowe, John Mayall, Earl Hooker, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix. By 1968, he had forged a friendship with Mike Bloomfield; they were roommates for many years until Bloomfield's untimely death. This event was the catalyst that placed Walker into a lifestyle change. He left the world of the blues and enrolled himself at San Francisco State University, achieving a degree in Music and English. Throughout this time, Walker was regularly performing with The Spiritual Corinthians Gospel Quartet. After a 1985 performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, he was inspired to return to his blues roots whereupon he formed the \\"Bosstalkers\\" and signed to the HighTone label. Under the auspices of Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker, his debut album, Cold Is The Night was released in 1986. He began a worldwide touring schedule, delivering a four more releases in succession for HighTone (The Gift (1988), Blue Soul (1989), Live at Slims Vol 1 (1991), and Live at Slims Volume 2 (1992). After the long partnership with HighTone, Walker was signed by Polygram to their Verve/Gitanes record label. His first of many Polygram releases ensued with Blues Survivor in 1993. This marked the beginning of an eclectic era that merged many of his gospel, jazz, soul, funk and rock influences with his trademark blues sensibilities. 1993 also saw the release of B.B. King's Grammy Award-winning Blues Summit album, which featured a duet with Walker (a Walker original, \\"Everybody's Had the Blues\\"). This was followed up by a live DVD release, featuring another duet with Walker (a rendition of \\"T-Bone Shuffle\\"). JLW was released in 1994, featuring guests such as James Cotton, Branford Marsalis, and the Tower of Power horn section. During this period, Walker's touring schedule saw many re-appearances at the world's music festivals (North Sea Jazz, Montreux, Glastonbury, San Francisco, Russian River Jazz, Monterey, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage, Byron Bay, Australia, Notodden, Lucerne, and at the Beacon Theatre in New York City). Walker also spent years covering all the major western television networks (Conan O'Brien, Imus, Jools Holland UK, inauguration for George W. Bush, inducting B.B. King for President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton into the Kennedy Centre Honors, Ohne Filter, Germany, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) as well as numerous worldwide TV networks. Blues of the Month Club was released in 1995, and was the first of three Walker albums that were co-produced with Steve Cropper. This was followed up by the release of Great Guitars in 1997. Walker's guest musicians on this release, included Bonnie Raitt, Buddy Guy, Taj Mahal, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Otis Rush, Scotty Moore, Robert Lockwood, Jr., Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, Steve Cropper, Tower of Power, and Ike Turner. Also in 1996, Walker played guitar on James Cotton's, Deep in the Blues, a Grammy Award winner for \\"Best Traditional Blues Album\\". In addition, Walker won his third Blues Music Award for Band of the Year (1996) which was preceded by two similar awards for \\"Contemporary Male Artist of the Year\\" (1988 and 1991). Walker also won the 1995 Bammy (Bay Area Music Award) for \\"Blues Musician of the Year\\". He then released Preacher and the President in 1998 and Silvertone Blues in 1999 (his sixth album for Polygram). This sequence continued with In The Morning (Telarc 2002), Pasa Tiempo (Evidence 2002), Guitar Brothers (JSP 2002), She's My Money Maker (JSP 2003), Ridin' High (Hightone 2003), New Direction (Provogue 2004) and Playin' Dirty (JSP 2006). In 2002, he featured on the Bo Diddley tribute album, Hey Bo Diddley ‚Äì A Tribute!, performing the song \\"Who Do You Love?\\". In March 2008, Walker signed to Stony Plain Records, and recorded his first album for the label in April (produced by Duke Robillard). This album featured guest appearances by Robillard and Todd Sharpville, and was released in September 2008. His second album for the label was released in September 2009 entitled, Between A Rock and The Blues. This album featured Kevin Eubanks as a special guest, best known for his work as the musical director for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. This album garnered five nominations in the 2010 Blues Music Awards. In 2012, Walker signed with Chicago-based Alligator Records and released Hellfire, produced by Tom Hambridge. Billboard Magazine called it \\"One of the strongest albums in Walker's canon. Hellfire blows all over the map‚Ä¶gutbucket blues, joyous gospel, Rolling Stones-style rock crunch, and aching R&B.; Walker's guitar playing is fine and fierce. Hellfire is a heavenly showcase for Walker's virtues.\\" In 2014, Alligator released Hornet's Nest, also produced by Hambridge. The Chicago Sun-Times said: \\"Hard rock to gospel, Hornet's Nest is proudly modern, designed to rest comfortably alongside anything from the Black Keys or Jack White. Walker's voice demands attention: scorching, imploring, always commanding, it leads this dynamic album along with his heavy guitar fills that lay the ground work for the horn-peppered soul, Memphis soul, gospel harmony, and a vortex of power chords and funk.

It was owned by Manchester Airports Group (the largest UK-owned airport group) from 1999 until 1 August 2012, when it was sold to the Eastern Group of companies. North Lincolnshire Council retains a minority of shares in the Airport. ==History== The airport was previously a Royal Air Force base, RAF Kirmington, opened in 1941 during the Second World War, from which No. 166 Squadron RAF operated the Avro Lancaster. The site was abandoned after the war in 1945, and lay unused until 1974 when the local council re-opened the site as Kirmington Airport. When the local area was renamed Humberside following local government re-organisation in England, the name was changed to Humberside Airport. The main runway, designated 03/21 (since redesignated 02/20) was extended to its current length in 1992, allowing operation of much larger aircraft. In 2008, MAG announced that it was conducting a review of its strategy for Humberside Airport, and all options including disposal were under consideration. Initially it announced plans to sell Humberside Airport after nine years of ownership. In December 2008, MAG announced it intended to retain Humberside Airport, due to a number of investments, such as the new ¬£1.6 million perishables hub, coupled with a surge in passenger numbers and little interest from potential bidders. MAG sold its 83.7% share of Humberside in 2012 for ¬£2.3 million to Eastern Group to focus on the larger airports in its portfolio. It was later revealed that MAG had bought the airport for almost ¬£8 million more in 1999. Bristow Helicopters sold Eastern Airways in 2019, but retained its majority share of Humberside Airport. ==Operations== The airport faces competition for flights from East Midlands Airport (), Doncaster Sheffield Airport () which opened in 2005 and Leeds Bradford Airport (); all of which have at a much wider range of scheduled passenger flights. Passengers at the airport peaked in the early to mid-2000s when the facility was used by around 500,000 per year. This fell to around 200,000 passengers in 2016. In October 2013 SAS Group began daily operations to Copenhagen, only to withdraw the service in April 2014 because of disappointing passenger numbers. However, Sun Air launched twice-weekly flights to Aalborg and Billund in April 2016, in order to support the off-shore wind industry in the Humber and Jutland locations. These flights were also suspended in December 2016. The airport is also used to service the offshore gas storage and drilling operations for BP and Centrica Storage with over 5,000 air transport helicopter movements in 2016, the fourth highest in the UK. On 3 January 2013 it was reported that Bond Offshore Helicopters had been awarded a contract with Perenco and would start operating flights to Perenco's platforms in the Southern North Sea. This now means that the airport has three of the biggest UK Helicopter operators based at the airport. From 1 April 2015 Bristow Helicopters commenced operations from a new UK Search and Rescue base at Humberside. In October 2016 Bristow Helicopters and Bond (now Babcock) moved their offshore operations to Norwich, leaving CHC and UNI-FLY as the remaining helicopter companies based at Humberside. CHC will commence a new contract for √òrsted (formerly DONG Energy) in April 2018, supporting North Sea wind farm construction. Humberside has one of the highest NEQ approval levels of any airport in Europe, and saw significant growth in cargo throughput from 144 tonnes in 2007 to 1,132 tonnes in 2011. This was due to regular flights by Icelandair Cargo, however these ceased to operate in 2012 and cargo had reduced to 123 tonnes in 2016. Humberside International has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P739) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. It has a very high amount of general aviation activity, with 5 resident flying clubs and organisations offering fixed wing and rotary training. Weston Aviation opened in May 2011 a fixed based operation (FBO). This will be the first dedicated FBO at the airport where the company has also opened a regional charter sales office to promote and develop the use of business and private aviation in Yorkshire and the Humber. ==Airlines and destinations== The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Humberside:humbersideairport.com - Destinations retrieved 8 October 2016 Alongside the above flights, charter flights take place to Iceland, Lapland and Italy. Eastern Airways also operate various weekend city breaks from the airport within Europe. ==Statistics== ===Passengers and movements=== {| style=\\"border:solid 1px #aaa;\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" |+Humberside Airport Passenger Totals 2000-2019 (thousands) |- | ImageSize = width:auto height:250 barincrement:29 PlotArea = left:30 bottom:15 top:10 right:15 AlignBars = justify Period = from:0 till:600 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical Colors = id:gray value:gray(0.5) id:line1 value:gray(0.9) id:line2 value:gray(0.7) ScaleMajor = start:0 increment:100 gridcolor:line2 ScaleMinor = start:0 increment:50 gridcolor:line1 PlotData= color:blue width:20 bar:2000 from:start till:447.738 bar:2001 from:start till:435.473 bar:2002 from:start till:492.433 bar:2003 from:start till:517.692 bar:2004 from:start till:531.277 bar:2005 from:start till:460.930 bar:2006 from:start till:520.956 bar:2007 from:start till:468.522 bar:2008 from:start till:427.669 bar:2009 from:start till:336.649 bar:2010 from:start till:283.191 bar:2011 from:start till:274.609 bar:2012 from:start till:234.142 bar:2013 from:start till:236.083 bar:2014 from:start till:239.17 bar:2015 from:start till:221.203 bar:2016 from:start till:201.650 bar:2017 from:start till:191.545 bar:2018 from:start till:192.526 color:darkblue bar:2019 from:start till:204.463 |} The memorial to 166 squadron at the door of the modern airport terminal {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"text-align: right; width:350px;\\" align=\\"center\\" |+ |- ! style=\\"width:75px\\"| !!

There is no stop on the line at this point and passengers must alight at the small, rural and unmanned Barnetby railway station some 2.5 miles (4 km) to the west of the airport, or proceed to Grimsby or Hull and use the bus service. ==Other facilities== The airline Eastern Airways has its head office in the Schiphol House on the airport property. Links Air was based at the airport, but moved to Doncaster Sheffield Airport in 2014. BAE Systems opened an aircraft maintenance academy at the airport in the autumn of 2015. It is a partnership with the Resource Group and is known as the R J Mitchell Academy, after the designer of the Spitfire aircraft. In 2010 a temporary hotel was erected for the use by the gas and oil rig workers. However, this operation is not designed or licensed to operate as accommodation for normal passengers.

It was formed in 1948 when all the private railway companies were nationalised during Juan Per√≥n's first presidential term, and transformed into the Empresa de Ferrocarriles del Estado Argentino (EFEA) (in English: Argentine State Railways Company). FA managed both, passenger and freight services, including long-distance and commuter rail trains in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. The company was broken up under the government of Carlos Menem following the privatisation of the railways; however in 2015 the government of Cristina Kirchner revived the brand for use on state-owned railways.Otro salto en la recuperaci√≥n de soberan√≠a - Pagina/12, 16 April 2015Es ley la creaci√≥n de Ferrocarriles Argentinos - EnElSubte, 15 April 2015Ferrocarriles Argentinos: Randazzo agradeci√≥ a la oposici√≥n parlamentaria por acompa√±ar en su recuperaci√≥n - Sala de Prensa de la Republica Argentina, 15 April 2015Ingres√≥ al Congreso la ley de creaci√≥n de Ferrocarriles Argentinos - EnElSubte.com, March 2015 == Beginning == President Juan Per√≥n signing the acquisition of foreign railway companies in 1948 In April 1946 some British companies executives, such as Reginald Leeper (then ambassador in Argentina) and Wilfred Eady, representative of several railway companies in Argentina, started to make the arrangements for the sale of their companies to the Argentine state. A commission led by Eady arrived in Buenos Aires during the winter of 1946. The Argentine Government approved the creation of a joint company to operate British railways, reestablishing the tax exemptions that had been in force during Law n¬∞ 5,315, also named \\"Mitre Law\\". On December 17, 1946, a contract was signed by Miguel Miranda, president of Instituto Argentino de Promoci√≥n del Intercambio and the ambassador Wladimir D'Ormesson for the sale of French companies in Argentina at a global price of A$ 182,796,173 (about US$45 million). That included Compa√±√≠a General de Buenos Aires, Province of Santa Fe and Rosario and Pto. Belgrano Railways. Two weeks after the agreement signed with French companies, the Government made an offer of ¬£ 125 million to British companies although the railways were finally acquired at ¬£150 million. The acquisition would be paid by Argentina with exports of meat and cereal to Great Britain, which would transfer the money to the former owners of the rail companies. On March 1, 1948, the Argentine government led by president Juan Per√≥n took over the British railways. The acquisition of the foreign railways was shown by the government as an act of sovereignty that would contribute to development of Argentine industry.\\"Breve historia de los ferrocarriles argentinos\\", La Gazeta After the nationalisation, the Argentine network continued expansion until 1954, when it reached a peak of length, the most in its history.\\"Voy en tren, voy en avi√≥n\\" by Manolo Lafuente, CBA24N.com\\"Afirman que la infraestructura ferroviaria es obsoleta\\", Cadena3, 2 Mar 2015 The Argentine network was also the biggest in Latin America. ===Divisions=== After the nationalisation all the Argentine network was grouped into six railway divisions named after distinguished Argentine presidents and national heroes (such as Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Manuel Belgrano, Domingo Sarmiento, Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, Bartolom√© Mitre and Julio A. Roca) according to their track gauge and locality. Apart from former British and French companies, Argentine ones also became part of \\"Ferrocarriles Argentinos\\", the state-owned company specifically created after the nationalisation to manage the entire railway network.

On January 1, 1954, a new state-owned company, \\"Ferrocarril Nacional Provincia de Buenos Aires\\" was establishing, with the infrastructure and rolling stock from former French companies. The railway network formerly operated by Midland became \\"M\\" line, while the Compa√±√≠a General line became \\"G\\" line. On May 14, 1949, the Argentine state acquired the Buenos Aires Central Railway, owned by the Lacroze Brothers, adding it to the standard gauge General Urquiza Railway network. In 1957 the new General Urquiza railway terminus in Buenos Aires was inaugurated, naming it \\"Federico Lacroze\\". The narrow gauge \\"Ferrocarril Depietri\\" railway (that connected cities of San Pedro and Arrecifes) would be later added in November 1949. Nevertheless, trains would be never run again on the line because the Provincial Railway did not show interest in the 68-km length line. The recently created Belgrano Railway did not take over the line. Therefore, the Argentine state returned the line to \\"Ferrocarriles y Elevadores Depietri\\" company. Depietri decided to bid the railway infrastructure as scrap. The state finally compensated Depietri for the deterioration of the line and the stolen material in 1975. In Patagonia region there were only a bunch of rail lines built and managed by the state but not connect between. They were FC Viedma-Nahuel Huapi, Comodoro Rivadavia Railway, Puerto Deseado Railway, all of them of broad gauge. Other railways were of narrow gauge, such as La Trochita, Gral. Vintter to Gral. Conesa (108 km) and Central Chubut Railway that connected Puerto Madryn with Playa Uni√≥n and Alto Las Plumas. Those lines were managed by state-owned Ferrocarriles Patag√≥nicos with the exception of Viedma-Bariloche and Jacobbacci-Esquel that had become part of General Roca Railway after nationalisation. The rest of the network would be added in 1956. Likewise, other branches were closed, such as the 1,9-km length to Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n, where thousand of pilgrims arrived each December 8. to celebrate Solemnity of the Virgin Mary. Services were cancelled in 1955 and the station demolished, while its tracks were lifted a year later. The Municipality of Luj√°n built a park (named \\"Bas√≠lica\\") on the same land where the station stood.\\"La estaci√≥n Bas√≠lica, un moj√≥n entra√±able\\", La Naci√≥n, 4 May 2013 == Rolling stock improvement == === National manufacturers impulse === At the moment of being nationalised, most part of Argentine railways' locomotives still were steam-powered and long- distance trips were in wooden coaches. It was not until the 1950s when the Government acquired brand new diesel locomotives produced in the United States, more specifically General Motors and Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton and Budd Company coaches that would be used in El Marplatense, an express service from Constituci√≥n to Mar del Plata with multiple luxury services. Despite the success of El Marplatense, FA did not acquired new material from Budd Co., being Dutch company Werkspoor the new locomotives and coaches supplier. The Werskpoor rolling stock was used for services to Mendoza, C√≥rdoba and Tucum√°n. During those years the first diesel locomotive manufactured in Argentina (named Justicialista and produced at Liniers workshops by national company F√°brica Argentina de Locomotoras (\\"FAdeL\\") was launched in October 1951 by President Per√≥n and its designer and builder, engineer Pedro Sacaggio. That locomotive (officially, \\"CM1\\") started to run in the summer of 1952-53 serving in El Marplatense and completing the 400-km length in only 4 hours. The CM1 was also used for services to Bariloche and Mendoza at an average speed of 90 km/h. The second model by FADEL was the CM2 La Argentina, powered with diesel engines by Italian manufacturers FIAT Ferroviaria and Cantieri Riuniti Dell Adri√°tico. Nevertheless, the project to produce 600 locomotives was aborted by the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora that took the Government in 1955. FADEL was subsequently closed and the plan of construction dismissed. After the closure of FADEL, Ferrocarriles Argentinos committed a company the manufacturing of 280 locomotives that would be powered with the 280 engines that had been acquired to FIAT, originally intended to be used in the FADEL machines to built. The new manufacturer was a local Italian-Argentine consortium named \\"Gruppo Aziende Italiane e Argentine\\" (mostly known for its acronym \\"GAIA\\"). The first 80 units and their engines were totally manufactured in Italy and the remaining 200 were built in Argentina between 1964 and 1970, using mostly national components. Despite the efforts to make a reliable locomotive for the Argentine railways, the GAIA machines did not satisfy the expectations and many units would be removed from circulations, remaining only a few locomotives serving at FA. In 1958 Sociedad Material Ferroviario (\\"Materfer\\") was established by Fiat Ferroviaria, through Fiat Concord, a consortium formed by many FIAT subsidiaries operating in Argentina. The company built a factory to manufacture rolling stock in the country to provide goods for FA.\\"Materfer\\" on Ferrocarriles del Sud, 2 Oct 2011 That same year the Ministry of Transport of Argentina signed an agreement with Fiat Ferroviaria to acquire 210 brand- new railcars. Those machines were formed by 2 units powered by a FIAT diesel engine at 660 HP. The railcars could reach speeds of 115 km/h. Their low weight made them suitable to run on any railway line. The vehicles also had two driver cabins, one on each end of the car, which reduced the time of manoeuvres at termini stations, particularly in urban services. Railcars were built in the FIAT factories of Turin, Decauville and C√≥rdoba. Although the first railcars were manufactured in Italy and France, most of them were made in Argentina, in a factory specially designed for that assignment located in Ferreyra, C√≥rdoba and named \\"Materfer\\". In 1962, the 7131, a railcar manufactured by FIAT Concord, made its debut in the Villa Ballester-Z√°rate and Victoria-Capilla del Se√±or sections of General Mitre Railway, then managed by Ferrocarriles Argentinos. Those light cars replaced Ganz Works railcars that had been run on those lines since 1938.Historia del Ferrocarril al Norte del Gran Buenos Aires: Ferrocarriles Mitre y Belgrano by Ariel Bernasconi - Dunken Editorial (2012) - Materfer also produced coaches that looked like Werkspoor's that were used for long-distance services to Bariloche (Los Arrayanes), Tucum√°n (Independencia), Posadas (Cataratas), Mendoza (El Libertador) with international connections with Chile and the Expreso del Sur. === Imported rolling stock === In 1951 the company acquired a total of 46 coaches from US manufacturer Budd Company. The rolling stock, originally built for standard gauge railways, had to be adapted to indian gauge used in Roca Railway. After a probationary period, trains began to run express services to Mar del Plata with a journey time of about 5 hours. Unlike old wooden coaches used until then, the American wagons were made of steel and came with comforts such as air conditioning and double glazing to insulate the passengers from noise, arm chairs, bars and restaurant carriage.El Marplatense, historia de confort on Portal de Trenes In 1955, 30 Werkspoor locomotives made in The Netherlands were acquired for the Belgrano Norte line. As a result, FA sent the old Ganz Works vehicles to C√≥rdoba to serve regional railways. Four years later, a fleet of 21 English Electric locomotives arrived to replace Whitcomb and Werkspoor machines. In 1964, 27 coaches built by Aerfer, a subsidiary of FIAT Ferroviaria, were added to the line. Four years later, the fleet size was increased with the addition of 20 coaches built by local company Materfer, which replaced the old ones made in Taf√≠ Viejo. Therefore, the English Electric locomotives worked with the Aerfer and Werkspoor coaches from then on. In 1962, the 7131, a railcar manufactured by FIAT Concord, made its debut in the Villa Ballester-Z√°rate and Victoria- Capilla del Se√±or sections of Mitre Railway. Those light cars replaced Ganz Works railcars that had been run on those lines since 1938. Modernisation included the purchase of brand-new diesel locomotives by American company Whitcomb in 1951 (with the addition of 15 new ones by Werkspoor in 1955) for the Belgrano Sur line. In the late 1960s and early 1970s railcars by Hungarian company Ganz Works were sent to the Belgrano Sur. They had been acquired by the Argentine State Railway decades earlier and had been running in Northern Argentine railways since 1936. Some of them were used for local services to Libertad and the rest for the long-distance service to Carhu√©, departing from Buenos Aires station. At the beginning of the 1960s, FA acquired brand new Hitachi electric multiple units, equipped with air conditioning for the metropolitan section of Mitre Railway. == Railway rationalisation: The Larkin Plan == By 1955 the reduction of the network was implemented through the so- called \\"Larkin Plan\\" (named because of American General Thomas B. Larkin who proposed for efficiency to reduce the Argentine redundant network to 29,000 km) several lines and branches were closed continuing during the presidency of Arturo Frondizi. As a result, by 1959 the operative railway network had decreased to 44,000 km. i.e. 4,000 km of tracks and at least 6 workshops were closed and 6,000 workers laid off. Tracks were lifted and lands and infrastructure sold.\\"El plan Larkin y la resistencia obrera\\" on Laguna Paiva web Some of the lines closed were the Belgrano Norte's Don Torcuato-Campo de Mayo branch and the B. Mitre-Delta (that would remain closed until 1995 when it was completely remodeled and re-opened as \\"Tren de la Costa\\"). Although the Larkin Plan was not completely implemented due to a strike that lasted 42 days in 1961, a high number of lines and branches were closed such as the lines between Etcheverry and Mira Pampa and Carlos Beguerie to Azul and Olavarr√≠a, together with their respective branch lines, all of them part of Province of Buenos Aires Railway. About 200,000 workers gave their support to the strike on October 30, with several acts of riot along the country. The government committed workers to get back to work threatening them with being imprisoned. President Frondizi threatened that strikers could be judged by military courts.\\"Breve s√≠ntesis hist√≥rica del ferrocarril desde el '55 hasta nuestros d√≠as\\" on Tren para Todos website == De Marchi era: 1968‚Äì71 == After the coup d'√©tat that overthrew president Arturo Illia, General Juan Carlos De Marchi was named president of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. Marchi carried out a plan of modernisation and investments for the railway network that included to invest US$850 million within five years.\\"Falleci√≥ el general (R) De Marchi\\", La Naci√≥n, 29 October 2004 During Marchi's administration the rolling stock was renewed, acquiring EMD GT22 and G22 diesel locomotives from the US and units by Materfer manufactured in C√≥rdoba. The EMD locomotives have been running on several railway lines of Argentina until today, such as Belgrano Norte and Belgrano Sur metropolitan services, Roca and Mitre railways long-distance services among others.\\"Las incansables GT-22\\" by Andr√©s J. Bilstein , Portal de Trenes, 8 June 2015 In 1968 De Marchi was elected secretary of the Latin America Railway Association.\\"El general que supo conducir ferrocarriles\\", El Litoral, 14 March 2005 In the early 1970s, FA acquired 128 electric units to Japanese consortium Marubeni to be used in Urquiza Railway metropolitan services. The units ran for the first time in 1974, replacing old trams that had been used until then. Nevertheless, some railways were closed during those years, such as Ferrocarril Econ√≥mico Correntino (1969) == Decline == By 1976, 3,000 km had been suppressed from the Argentine network, with a total extension of 41,400 km. That same year the military dictatorship led by Jorge Videla overthrew president Isabel Per√≥n beginning the National Reorganization Process. During those years, other 6,300 km would be closed, apart from suppressing a 50% of passenger services and firing 40% of railway workers (from 156,000 to 96,000 employees). 1,000 stations were closed over a total of 2,400. The railway network went from 41,400 km to 31,110 in 1980. Some of the railway lines during that period were Comodoro Rivadavia, Puerto Deseado and lines from Carlos Beguerie to Mira Pampa (1974) and Avellaneda to La Plata (1977) of Province of Buenos Aires railways. After the rationalisation, the total extension of each railway division was as follows: {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- ! width=150px| Division ! width=100px| Extension (km) |- | Sarmiento || 4,058 |- | Mitre || 5,490 |- | Roca || 6,827 |- | San Mart√≠n || 4,523 |- | Urquiza || 2,741 |- | Belgrano || 10,474 |} The following democratic Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's administration keep the services active but the critical economic situation caused FA entered into recession. One of the achievements during Alfons√≠n's government was the electrification of Roca suburban branches from Constituci√≥n to Ezeiza and Glew. In addition, the entire fleet of trains was renewed, acquiring EMU by Japanese companies Nippon Sharyo, Kinki Sharyo, Tokyu Car, Kawasaki and Hitachi. The electrified rail system was opened to public in November, 1985.\\"Los el√©ctricos japoneses del Roca\\" by Andr√©s J. Bilstein on Portal de Trenes, 20 Oct 2014 After being electrified, the number of passengers carried increased considerably. == Break-up and privatisation == === Background === Under the Carlos Menem's administration FA was closed and all services privatised Following a prolonged period of hyperinflation in the 1980s, accompanied by a steep increase in fiscal deficit and a sharp fall in reserves, the Argentine government, under the presidency of Carlos Menem from 1989, initiated a series of neoliberal reforms which included the privatisation of public utility companies (telephones, gas, electricity and water) together with the entire railway network. The plan was to break up the network into segments and to grant concessions to private companies for their operation through competitive bidding. Freight and passenger services were separated and, since most of the intercity passenger services were not commercially attractive to the private sector, the government offered these to the provinces. The remaining passenger services in the city of Buenos Aires, including the five lines of the Metro, were potentially more viable and were treated separately. === Metropolitan services === By Decree n¬∞ 520/91, in 1991 a new state-owned company, Ferrocarriles Metropolitanos S.A. (FEMESA) was create to operate metropolitan services in the city and suburbs of Buenos Aires Province until the privatisation process was carried out. Since then on, Ferrocarriles Argentinos only operated freight and passenger (long-distance only) services until they were granted in concession to private companies. Projects not only included Buenos Aires but cities of C√≥rdoba, Rosario and Mendoza with the idea of establishing urban services that included rapid transit transport. In the case of C√≥rdoba, the plan foresaw to unify the two stations in the city and to connect Ferreyra and Arg√ºello districts. The project for Mendoza foresaw to build a new terminal near the El Plumerillo Airport. Nevertheless, the plans were never carried out. === Freight trains === Freight train in Ingeniero Mauri, 1993 Privatisation began with the granting of long-term concessions (30 years with an optional 10-year extension) to six companies for the operation of freight services. These companies were responsible for all operations and maintenance and for the implementation of the investment programme detailed in their bid. The fixed assets remained the property of the state and the operators had to pay for their use and to rent rolling stock. Freight tariffs were deregulated but were subject to state approval. The concessionaires were expected to hire as many FA employees as were required and redundancies were financed by the government with the help of the World Bank.\\"La concesi√≥n del sistema ferroviario de Cargas\\" - Historia de los Ferrocarriles Argentinos, CNRT website (Archive), 23 Dec 2011 Initially no bids were received for the Belgrano railway, and in October 1993 the government created a new state-owned corporation to continue its operation and to undertake improvements likely to make it a more attractive commercial proposition for a private buyer. Privatisation followed six years later when Belgrano Cargas took over the line. === Long-distance services closure === The Gran Capit√°n, long-distance service to Misiones province, circa 1990 The only rail line catalogued as \\"profitable\\" was the Constituci√≥n-Mar del Plata section. On March 10, 1993, president Menem signed the decree for which all the long-distance passenger services were definitely closed. Some of the provinces that lost their connection with Buenos Aires were Salta, Jujuy, Entre R√≠os, Corrientes, Misiones, Mendoza, San Juan, San Luis, Catamarca and La Rioja. The closure caused many villages became isolated from the main cities of Argentina and younger inhabitants departed from their born towns looking for better opportunities. This happened in cities such as La Banda, Laguna Paiva, San Crist√≥bal, Navarro, Las Marianas among many others. While in 1960 trains had carried 539 million of passengers, thirty years after the number decreased to 264 million. Between 1991 and 1992 urban and inter-city services were cancelled due to lack of locomotives to run. In San Mart√≠n and Roca lines trains had only two coaches in poor conditions. In addition, railway unions made sudden strikes that left passengers abandoned midway. During the last year of state administration there were 239,000 services cancelled or delayed. After the closure the National government offered the provinces to reactivate railway lines at their own expense. Provinces that reached an agreement with the central government to operate their services were Buenos Aires (establishing its own company, Ferrobaires), Tucum√°n (with Tucum√°n Ferrocarriles running trains since 1997), R√≠o Negro (Servicios Ferroviarios Patag√≥nico, still operating), C√≥rdoba, La Pampa (also with services by Ferrobaires) and Chubut. Likewise, the government also transferred some branches to the provinces, such as Viedma-Bariloche and Ingeniero Jacobbaci- Esquel to R√≠o Negro and Chubut (so the railway crossed both provinces); C√≥rdoba-Cruz del Eje to C√≥rdoba Province. Salta received the Tren a las Nubes and Mendoza took over Transandine Railway. In all the cases, the procedures were ruled by Law n¬∞ 2.873.Ley reglamentando la construcci√≥n y esplotaci√≥n de todos los Ferro-Carriles de la Rep√∫blica - Ley 2.873 (1891-09-18) on Infoleg == Winding-up == On July 7, 1995, the company was declared into a state of liquidation by decree n¬∞ 2394/92, ceasing operations that same day.FERROCARRILES ARGENTINOS - Decreto 1039/95.

It received widespread public attention in 2019 over its policy of forcing girls to wear trousers. ==History== Priory School was originally formed in 1969 when the Lewes County Grammar School for Girls, the Lewes County Grammar School for Boys and the Lewes Secondary Modern School were amalgamated to form a comprehensive school called Priory School, its name referring to the nearby Lewes Priory. At this point, although the school was comprehensive for children who lived within the town of Lewes, it was also open to children from the surrounding towns and villages who had passed the 11 plus. During this period there was also academic streaming: the names of the streamed groups were based on the letters of the word MOUNTFIELD. In its early years (from 1969 until around 1980) the school was in three separate locations: the former Girls' Grammar School buildings in Potter's Lane housed the Lower School (ages 12‚Äì13), while on Mountfield Road the Secondary Modern buildings housed the Middle School (ages 14‚Äì15), with the Upper School (ages 16‚Äì18) in the former Boys' Grammar. Later, in the early 1990s, Potter's Lane site was turned into a primary school now housing Southover and Western Road Schools; Priory School itself was split into Priory School (11‚Äì16) on the former Secondary Modern site and the Sixth Form (16-18), housed on the former Boys' Grammar School site, merged with Lewes Technical College, which had a site opposite in Mountfield Road, to become Lewes Tertiary College and now East Sussex College In 2017 the uniform was changed to prohibit new joiners from wearing skirts, and was said by the headteacher to be \\"gender-neutral\\". Multiple news outlets and alumni, including Piers Morgan criticised the move, stating that the restrictions were more of a contradiction than a progression in uniforms.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-49599078 ==Site== Priory School then became centred on the site of the former Secondary Modern School and new buildings have since been added. The adjacent buildings formerly used by the County Grammar School for Boys and by the Sixth Form have become part of the Lewes Campus of East Sussex College (Further Education). The Chapel, of the former Boys' Grammar School, was retained by the Priory School. This chapel was built after the Second World War to commemorate the boys from the school who fought in the war. Next to it is the Music Block, which was rebuilt in 2008 in place of the old temporary one. The new block features improved disabled access, but thin walls and a void beneath the floor make it a rather difficult environment for music lessons. In 1993, the new revised version of Priory School opened boasting a new wing ‚Äì the \\"South Block\\" ‚Äì and a heavily refurbished main building. The latter was the home of Lewes Secondary Modern School until 1969, sporting a distinctive copper plated clock tower. The main building included new science labs, a library and design technology rooms, built in anticipation of design technology being in the National Curriculum. The South Block hosts, on the ground floor, the Art, Maths, Modern Foreign Languages and English classrooms and on the first floor the Humanities classrooms. The Performing Arts Block was built recently next to the Main Hall. The nearby Leisure Centre is used for indoor sports and the nearby Convent Fields, the Cricket Nets and the Tennis Courts, for outdoor ones. Between the South Block and the Main Building is a playground called the Quad. The tarmac playground continues until the chapel but there are large muddy and grassy areas surrounding it. ==Arts== The Head of History, Jim Butt and co- writer Colin Burgess wrote an entire musical about the life of local First World War soldier, Private Rupert Freeman, called \\"In the Pink\\". Priory has been awarded Arts and Language College statuses, specialising in these areas with increased funding. The three modern foreign languages taught are Spanish, French and German. There is also a Chinese club. A number of pupils have gone on to make careers in the arts. Eric Goulden amd Pete Thomas made their names in the music business. Annabel Abbs and Lucy Atkins have had a number of books published. ==Chapel== In 1960 a chapel, designed by Sir Edward Maufe,Comprehensive List of Building's designed by Sir Edward Maufe. Retrieved September 2011 was built to honour the boys from the Lewes County Grammar School for Boys who died in the Second World War.

Business Continuity refers to the ability of a business to continue critical functions and business processes after the occurrence of a disaster, whereas Disaster Recovery refers specifically to the Information Technology (IT) and data- centric functions of the business, and is a subset of Business Continuity. ==Metrics== The primary objective is to protect the organization in the event that all or part of its operations and/or computer services are rendered partially or completely unusable. A DR plan illustrating the chronology of the ' and the ' with respect to the '. Minimizing downtime and data loss during disaster recovery is measured in terms of two concepts: * Recovery Time Objective (RTO), time until a system is completely up and running * Recovery Point Objective (RPO), a measure of the ability to recover files by specifying a point in time restore of the backup copy. ==The auditor's role== An auditor examines and assess * that the procedures stated in the BCP and DR plan are actually consistent with real practice * that a specific individual within the organization, who may be referred to as the disaster recovery officer, the disaster recovery liaison, the DR coordinator, or some other similar title, has the technical skills, training, experience, and abilities to analyze the capabilities of the team members to complete assigned tasks * that more than one individual is trained and capable of doing a particular function. Tests and inquiries of personnel can help achieve this objective. ==Documentation== To maximize their effectiveness, disaster recovery plans are most effective when updated frequently, and should: * be an integral part of all business analysis processes, * be revisited at every major corporate acquisition, at every new product launch and at every new system development milestone. Adequate records need to be retained by the organization. The auditor examines records, billings, and contracts to verify that records are being kept. One such record is a current list of the organization's hardware and software vendors. Such list is made and periodically updated to reflect changing business practice. Copies of it are stored on and off site and are made available or accessible to those who require them. An auditor tests the procedures used to meet this objective and determine their effectiveness. ===Disaster recovery plan=== A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a documented process or set of procedures to execute an organization's disaster recovery processes and recover and protect a business IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster. It is \\"a comprehensive statement of consistent actions to be taken before, during and after a disaster\\". The disaster could be natural, environmental or man-made. Man-made disasters could be intentional (for example, an act of a terrorist) or unintentional (that is, accidental, such as the breakage of a man-made dam). ====Types of plans==== Although there is no one-size-fits-all plan, there are three basic strategies: # prevention, including proper backups, having surge protectors and generators # detection, a byproduct of routine inspections, which may discover new (potential) threats # correction The latter may include securing proper insurance policies, and holding a \\"lessons learned\\" brainstorming session. ===Relationship to the Business Continuity Plan=== The Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a comprehensive organizational plan that includes the disaster recovery plan, and it consists of five component plans: * Business Resumption Plan * Occupant Emergency Plan * Continuity of Operations Plan * Incident Management Plan * Disaster Recovery Plan The first three (Business Resumption, Occupant Emergency, and Continuity of Operations Plans) do not deal with the IT infrastructure. The Incident Management Plan (IMP) does deal with the IT infrastructure, but since it establishes structure and procedures to address cyber attacks against an organization‚Äôs IT systems, it generally does not represent an agent for activating the Disaster Recovery Plan, leaving The Disaster Recovery Plan as the only BCP component of interest to IT. ==Benefits== Like every insurance plan, there are benefits that can be obtained from proper planning, including: * Minimizing risk of delays * Guaranteeing the reliability of standby systems * Providing a standard for testing the plan * Minimizing decision-making during a disaster * Reducing potential legal liabilities * Lowering unnecessarily stressful work environment ===Planning and testing methodology=== According to Geoffrey H. Wold of the Disaster Recovery Journal, the entire process involved in developing a Disaster Recovery Plan consists of 10 steps: * Performing a risk assessment: The planning committee prepares a risk analysis and a business impact analysis (BIA) that includes a range of possible disasters. Each functional area of the organization is analyzed to determine potential consequences. Traditionally, fire has posed the greatest threat. A thorough plan provides for \\"worst case\\" situations, such as destruction of the main building. * Establishing priorities for processing and operations: Critical needs of each department are evaluated and prioritized. Written agreements for alternatives selected are prepared, with details specifying duration, termination conditions, system testing, cost, any special security procedures, procedure for the notification of system changes, hours of operation, the specific hardware and other equipment required for processing, personnel requirements, definition of the circumstances constituting an emergency, process to negotiate service extensions, guarantee of compatibility, availability, non-mainframe resource requirements, priorities, and other contractual issues. * Collecting data: This includes various lists (employee backup position listing, critical telephone numbers list, master call list, master vendor list, notification checklist), inventories (communications equipment, documentation, office equipment, forms, insurance policies, workgroup and data center computer hardware, microcomputer hardware and software, office supply, off-site storage location equipment, telephones, etc.), distribution register, software and data files backup/retention schedules, temporary location specifications, any other such lists, materials, inventories, and documentation. Pre-formatted forms are often used to facilitate the data gathering process. * Organizing and documenting a written plan * Developing testing criteria and procedures: reasons for testing include ** Determining the feasibility and compatibility of backup facilities and procedures. ** Identifying areas in the plan that need modification. ** Providing training to the team managers and team members. ** Demonstrating the ability of the organization to recover. ** Providing motivation for maintaining and updating the disaster recovery plan. * Testing the plan: An initial \\"dry run\\" of the plan is performed by conducting a structured walk- through test. An actual test-run must be performed. Problems are corrected. Initial testing can be plan is done in sections and after normal business hours to minimize disruptions. Subsequent tests occur during normal business hours. Types of tests include: checklist tests, simulation tests, parallel tests, and full interruption tests. ===Caveats/controversies=== Due to high cost, various plans are not without critics. Dell has identified five \\"common mistakes\\" organizations often make related to BCP/DR planning: * Lack of buy- in: When executive management sees DR planning as \\"just another fake earthquake drill\\" or CEOs fail to make DR planning and preparation a priority * Incomplete RTOs and RPOs: Failure to include each and every important business process or a block of data. Ripples can extend a disaster's impact. Payroll may not initially be mission-critical, but left alone for several days, it can become more important than any of your initial problems. * Systems myopia: A third point of failure involves focusing only on DR without considering the larger business continuity needs. Corporate office space lost to a disaster can result in an instant pool of teleworkers which, in turn, can overload a company's VPN overnight, overwork the IT support staff at the blink of an eye and cause serious bottlenecks and monopolies with the dial-in PBX system. * Lax security: When there is a disaster, an organization's data and business processes become vulnerable. As such, security can be more important than the raw speed involved in a disaster recovery plan's RTO. The most critical consideration then becomes securing the new data pipelines: from new VPNs to the connection from offsite backup services. ** In disasters, planning for post-mortem forensics ** Locking down or remotely wiping lost handheld devices ==Decisions and strategies== * Site designation: hot site vs. cold site. A hot site is fully equipped to resume operations while a cold site does not have that capability. A warm site has the capability to resume some, but not all operations. : A cost-benefit analysis is needed. :* Occasional tests and trials verify the viability and effectiveness of the plan. An auditor looks into the probability that operations of the organization can be sustained at the level that is assumed in the plan, and the ability of the entity to actually establish operations at the site. :* The auditor can verify this through paper and paperless documentation and actual physical observation. The security of the storage site is also confirmed. * Data backup: An audit of backup processes determines if (a) they are effective, and (b) if they are actually being implemented by the involved personnel.Berman, Alan. : Constructing a Successful Business Continuity Plan. Business Insurance Magazine, March 9, 2015. http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150309/ISSUE0401/303159991/constructing- a-successful-business-continuity-plan :The disaster recovery plan also includes information on how best to recover any data that has not been copied. Controls and protections are put in place to ensure that data is not damaged, altered, or destroyed during this process. * Drills: Practice drills conducted periodically to determine how effective the plan is and to determine what changes may be necessary. The auditor‚Äôs primary concern here is verifying that these drills are being conducted properly and that problems uncovered during these drills are addressed. * Backup of key personnel - including periodic training and cross-training. ==Other considerations== ===Insurance issues=== The auditor determines the adequacy of the company's insurance coverage (particularly property and casualty insurance) through a review of the company's insurance policies and other research. Among the items that the auditor needs to verify are: the scope of the policy (including any stated exclusions), that the amount of coverage is sufficient to cover the organization‚Äôs needs, and that the policy is current and in force. The auditor also ascertains, through a review of the ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, that the insurance company or companies providing the coverage have the financial viability to cover the losses in the event of a disaster. Effective DR plans take into account the extent of a company's responsibilities to other entities and its ability to fulfill those commitments despite a major disaster. A good DR audit will include a review of existing MOA and contracts to ensure that the organization's legal liability for lack of performance in the event of disaster or any other unusual circumstance is minimized. Agreements pertaining to establishing support and assisting with recovery for the entity are also outlined. Techniques used for evaluating this area include an examination of the reasonableness of the plan, a determination of whether or not the plan takes all factors into account, and a verification of the contracts and agreements reasonableness through documentation and outside research. ===Communication issues=== The auditor must verify that planning ensures that both management and the recovery team have effective communication hardware, contact information for both internal communication and external issues, such as business partners and key customers. Audit techniques include * testing of procedures, interviewing employees, making comparison against the plans of other company and against industry standards, * examining company manuals and other written procedures. * direct observation that emergency telephone numbers are listed and easily accessible in the event of a disaster. ===Emergency procedures=== Procedures to sustain staff during a round-the clock disaster recovery effort are included in any good disaster recovery plan. Procedures for the stocking of food and water, capabilities of administering CPR/first aid, and dealing with family emergencies are clearly written and tested. This can generally be accomplished by the company through good training programs and a clear definition of job responsibilities. A review of the readiness capacity of a plan often includes tasks such as inquires of personnel, direct physical observation, and examination of training records and any certifications. ===Environmental issues=== The auditor must review procedures that take into account the possibility of power failures or other situations that are of a non-IT nature. * Flashlights and candles may be needed. * Safety procedures in case of gas leaks, fires or other such phenomena ==See also== * Backup rotation scheme * Information technology audit * Comparison of backup software * Comparison of online backup services * Vulnerability (computing) ==References== * * Category:Data management Category:Backup Category:IT risk management Category:Planning ","title":"Disaster recovery and business continuity auditing"},{"id":"1997269","text":"right In Italy, the polizia provinciale are the provincial-level police forces.

He is best known for his insight into social conditions as revealed by his writings, which were published in 1903. ==Life== Commemorative plaque in School Lane, Liverpool Creevey was the son of William Creevey, a Liverpool merchant, and was born in that city. He went to Queens' College, Cambridge, and graduated as seventh Wrangler in 1789. The same year he became a student at the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar in 1794. In 1802 he entered Parliament through the Duke of Norfolk's nomination as member for Thetford, and married a widow with six children, Mrs Ord, who had a life interest in a comfortable income. Creevey was a Whig and a follower of Charles James Fox, and his active intellect and social qualities procured him a considerable intimacy with the leaders of this political circle. In 1806, when the brief \\"All the Talents\\" ministry was formed, he was given the office of secretary to the Board of Control; in 1830, when next his party came into power, Creevey, who had lost his seat in parliament, was appointed by Lord Grey Treasurer of the Ordnance; and subsequently Lord Melbourne made him treasurer of Greenwich Hospital. Creevey is also known for being the first civilian to interview the Duke of Wellington after the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. He and his wife, who was ill at the time, were vacationing in Brussels when Napoleon was defeated by British and Prussian forces near the Belgian border. At their meeting in Wellington's headquarters, Creevey recorded the Duke's famous quote about the battle (\\"It was a near run thing. The nearest run thing you ever saw in your life.\\") After 1818, when his wife died, he had very slender means of his own, but he was popular with his friends and was well looked after by them; his close association with Lord Sefton, led to speculation that they were biological half-brothers‚Äîa rumour which Creevey himself appeared to abet.Fisher D.R. (2009). \\"CREEVEY, Thomas (1768-1838)\\". The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832. Cambridge University Press. Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville, writing of him in 1829, remarks that \\"old Creevey is a living proof that a man may be perfectly happy and exceedingly poor. I think he is the only man I know in society who possesses nothing.\\"Charles C. F. Greville, A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV, volume I (Longmans Green & Co, London, 1874), at page 235 He is remembered through the Creevey Papers, published in 1903 under the editorship of Sir Herbert Maxwell, which, consisting partly of Creevey's own journals and partly of correspondence, give a lively and valuable picture of the political and social life of the late Georgian era, and are characterized by an almost Pepysian outspokenness. They are a useful addition and correction to the Croker Papers, written from a Tory point of view. For thirty-six years Creevey had kept a \\"copious diary\\", and had preserved a vast miscellaneous correspondence with such people as Lord Brougham, and his stepdaughter, Elizabeth Ord, had assisted him, by keeping his letters to her, in compiling material avowedly for a collection of Creevey Papers in the future. At his death it was found that he had left his mistress, with whom he had lived for four years, his sole executrix and legatee, and Greville notes in his Memoirs the anxiety of Brougham and others to get the papers into their hands and suppress them. The diary, mentioned above, did not survive, perhaps through Brougham's success, and the papers from which Sir Herbert Maxwell made his selection came into his hands from Mrs Blackett Ord, whose husband was the grandson of Creevey's eldest stepdaughter. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Gore, John. \\"Thomas Creevy: A Later Reappraisal\\" History Today (Oct 1958) 8#10 pp 690-69 * == External links== * Category:1768 births Category:1838 deaths Category:Whig (British political party) MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1802‚Äì1806 Category:UK MPs 1807‚Äì1812 Category:UK MPs 1812‚Äì1818 Category:UK MPs 1820‚Äì1826 Category:UK MPs 1831‚Äì1832 Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge ","title":"Thomas Creevey"},{"id":"1997279","text":" USS Converse (DD-509), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for George A. Converse (1844-1909). Converse was launched 30 August 1942 by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine; sponsored by Miss A. V. Jackson; and commissioned 20 November 1942, Commander D. C. E. Hamberger in command. == Solomon Islands, May 1943 - March 1944 == After training at Guantanamo Bay and Pearl Harbor, Converse arrived at Noum√©a 17 May 1943, and through the summer covered convoys carrying men and supplies to New Georgia, then escorted ships moving between Espiritu Santo and Guadalcanal. Arriving at Port Purvis in the Solomon Islands 16 September 1943, she joined Destroyer Squadron 23 (DesRon 23), with whom she was to win a Presidential Unit Citation (US) for operations in the northern Solomons between 31 October 1943 and 4 February 1944. On the first of those dates, Converse sortied with her squadron and cruisers to provide cover for amphibious landings on Bougainville, and on the night of 31 October - 1 November 1943, bombarded Buka and Bonis airfields and targets in the Shortlands. The next night her force intercepted a Japanese group of cruisers and destroyers heading for an attack on the transports lying at Bougainville, and opened fire in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay. The Japanese lost one cruiser and one destroyer in this action, and were turned back from their intended attack on the transports, although the American defenders came under severe attack by aircraft from Rabaul supporting the Japanese ships. Converse continued bombardments and escort duty supporting the Bougainville operation, and on the night of 16-17 November 1943 joined in firing on a surfaced submarine, scoring several hits. On the night of 24-25 November, the squadron intercepted five Japanese destroyers attempting to evacuate critically needed aviation troops from Buka to Rabaul. In a skillfully-executed torpedo attack followed by a persistent chase, during which Converse was struck by a torpedo which failed to explode, the squadron sank three of the enemy ships and caused heavy damage to a fourth, while emerging unscathed themselves. While escorting a group of ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to Bougainville 3 December 1943, Converse came under heavy attack from six waves of Japanese bombers. A near miss caused an electrical failure, putting her radar out of commission and resulting in a loss of power forward. Repairs were quickly made, and the Japanese force fought off, but Converse sailed from Port Purvis 14 December for complete repairs at Sydney, Australia. She rejoined her squadron at Port Purvis 30 January 1944 for bombardments and hunting forays against Japanese shipping through February and March in the northern Solomons. == Central Pacific, March - August 1944 == Converse cleared Port Purvis 27 March 1944 to join the Fast Carrier Task Force (then-TF 58) for screening duty during the air strikes on the Palaus from 30 March to 1 April, and with that force covered the Hollandia landings through preinvasion air attacks and bombardment, continuing their fire during the landings 22 April. Carrier attacks on Truk, Satawan, and Ponape at the close of the month found Converse continuing her screening duties. Attacks preparatory to, and covering, the invasion of Saipan began 12 June as targets throughout the Marianas were hit. While the landings themselves were made on 15 June, Converse's task force hit at Japanese bases in the Bonins, then returned to the Marianas to continue their close support. When the Japanese fleet challenged the American operations in the Marianas on 19 June, Converse continued her screening through the resulting aerial Battle of the Philippine Sea, a 2-day engagement which resulted in the sinking of three Japanese carriers and the loss to Japan of many aircraft and their irreplaceable pilots. After joining in shore bombardment of Guam and Rota at the, close of June, Converse replenished at Eniwetok, and on 4 August, sailed for overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. == Philippines and Okinawa, November 1944 - August 1945 == The destroyer returned to action 3 November 1944 when she joined the screen of carriers covering the convoy routes to newly invaded Leyte. On 21 December, while escorting the first resupply echelon to Mindoro, Converse came under attack by desperate Japanese suicide planes, and fired to drive them away as well as rescuing 266 survivors of LST-749. She gave fire support to the landings in Lingayen Gulf on 9 and 10 January 1945, and then joined the task unit assigned to recapture Corregidor. Her guns destroyed gun emplacements, barges, suicide boats, and entombed about 100 enemy troops by sealing the entrance to Malinta Tunnel. After brief overhaul in Subic Bay, Converse patrolled off Corregidor until mid-March 1945, and from 18 March to 1 April joined in the invasion of Panay and Negros. Through the next month she carried out a variety of duties in the development of Iloilo as a staging center for the planned invasion of Japan. On 16 May, Converse arrived off Okinawa, where she operated on dangerous and demanding radar picket duty until the close of the war. Often firing to drive off suicide-bent Japanese aircraft, she received no damage during the difficult months that followed. On 10 September she sailed from Okinawa for Pearl Harbor, the Panama Canal, and Washington, D.C., where on 19 October, the ceremonial award of the Presidential Unit Citation was made to her squadron. After overhaul at Brooklyn, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Charleston, South Carolina, 23 April 1946. In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, Converse received 11 battle stars for World War II service. == Almirante Vald√©s (D23) == On 1 July 1959 Converse was transferred under the Mutual Assistance Program to Spain, where she was renamed Almirante Vald√©s (D23).
