It has not been recorded in the wild since 1979. Description Mount Glorious day frogs varied in size, ranging from 22.0-30.6 mm in length. Males generally ranged from 22.0-27.2 mm long, while females were slightly larger, ranging from 23.3-30.6 mm. The dorsal skin had a grey or brown tone with dark spots or streaks, and was mostly smooth, with some granular texture. The abdominal skin was a creamy white or bluish-grey, with occasional grey spots. Taxonomy Closest living relatives of the Mount Gloroius day frog are the Sharp snouted day frog (Taudactylus acutirostris), the Eungella torrent frog (Taudactylus eungellensis), the Eungella tinker frog (Taudactylus liemi), the Kroombit tinker frog (Taudactylus pleione), and the Northern tinker frog (Taudactylus rheophilus). Habitat and distribution Taudactylus diurnus is native to Australia, and was found in the Blackall, Conondale, and D’Aguilar Ranges. The species resided in the altitudinal range of 350 to 800 meters above sea level. The Mount Glorious day frog vanished from the D’Aguilar Range in 1975, followed by its disappearance from the Blackall Range in 1978 and lastly from the Conondale Range in early 1979. D’Aguilar Range, Conondale Range, and Kondalilla Falls still remain protected habitats within the Australian National Parks system, although no new evidence of the frog has been found. The species occupied montane rain forests, specifically in long-lasting and temporary streams on gravel, clay, sand and usually areas with rocky soil substrate. It was also found in exposed areas, gorges, and dense wet areas with a lot of vegetation. Ecology The Mount Glorious day frog was most active during the day, becoming less and less active toward the evening. As it was found primarily along streams, it rarely moved far away from such wet environments, and it frequently had to enter the water.\\"Biodiversity.\\" Taudactylus Diurnus — Southern Day Frog, Mt Glorious Torrent Frog. Commonwealth of Australia, n.d. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. This included swimming often or submerging itself in the water from time to time for rehydration. At night, when the frogs were less active, they could be seen moving throughout cool rock crevices and staying in moist parts of their environment like under debris, along the water's edge, and around damp vegetation. Reproduction The species bred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak. The female deposited 24-36 eggs in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water; tadpoles could be found throughout the year. Males and femaled participated in amplexus mating behavior. Diet The Mount Glorious day frog fed primarily on small invertebrates along the forest floor. These include flat-bodied crustaceans, winged insects, butterfly or moth larvae, and other small insects along streams. Extinction Taudactylus diurnus was first described by Australian zoologists Straughan and Lee in 1966. The frog was abundant in the south eastern Queensland in the early 1970s but then rapidly began to decline. In a period of about 3 to 4 years, the frog was considered to be endangered, having disappeared from D’Aguilar Range around 1975 and Blackall Range around 1978. The species has not been spotted since approximately 1979. In 1994, the Groombridge Scientific Journal declared the species to be endangered, which was followed up in 1996 with the IUCN Redlist declaring the species to be critically endangered. Efforts to relocate the species continued up until 2004, when the IUCN Redlist determined the species officially as extinct due to a lack of evidence of their existence in the wild for roughly 25 years. Causes of extinction One of the threats to the Mount Glorious day frog was the contamination of water with mud by feral pigs. Feral pigs made the water muddy making it difficult for the frogs to reproduce and develop. In addition, feral pigs also preyed on the frogs. Changes in the flow of stream water, the spread of invasive species, and the spread of chytridiomycosis have also been implicated in the disappearance of the species. A connection has been made between the frog's extinction and the presence of the invasive plant species Lantana camara and Ageratina riparia.

In only four years the school has worked hard on recruiting and has brought most of the programs to the level of the Sunshine State Conference. In 2006–2007, they built the new state-of-the-art University Center which most notably holds the Shark Tank, a multipurpose arena that is most commonly used as a basketball arena. The structure holds 5,500 fans. The Sharks were originally called the Knights, which was from 1982 until 2004. In 2005, they unveiled the new Sharks logo and athletic mascot. The nickname was selected by the students of Nova Southeastern University. The university has also made great strides in increasing its spot offerings and putting as many student-athletes on the field as possible.

The building is approximately . The University Center is now considered the hub of the university for all students. This is a multipurpose facility that serves for more than just athletics: it is also used for extracurricular activities as well as other leisure activities. The main arena, The Rick Case Arena, which seats 5,500, is the home for the Sharks intercollegiate athletic program, and will host all of NSU's volleyball and men's and women's basketball home games. With one main game court, the arena also has two practice/game –ready courts on the upper level. The arena also has the state-of-the-art capabilities to host concerts, lectures, special events and more for NSU and the surrounding community. The Rick Case Arena features 5,500 seats, each with a seat back. The main court provides for over 1,200 permanent chair-back seats, while the upper level has over 4,000 seats. The upper level houses the world's largest automated telescopic seating system, which adds over 2,000 chair-back seats on either side when extended. The Rick Case Arena also features club level seating for boosters and donors. The area includes 66 cushioned seats overlooking the court, the area directly behind the head basket. Both seating sections are connected to the booster/donor room. Shark Club members, the donors and boosters, enjoy the comfort of the club level area which includes a suite with catering and other luxuries. These members also have the privilege of baseline seating for the best view possible. AD Griffin Sports Complex The AD Griffin Sports Complex is home to the Nova Southeastern University Softball team. This complex is equipped with 3 fields, 2 of them are used for practices, and then the main field used for games. All three field have lights so that they can allow the team to have night practices and games. The Sharks softball team's main field overlooks Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division Building. The three fields are all connected by the press box area. The pressbox looks over all three of the field, but is used mostly for the main field. Also, the AD Griffin complex is adjacent to the Miami Dolphins Training facility. The AD Griffin Sports Complex was named in honor of Mr. A.D. Griffin, Sr. NSU Baseball Complex The NSU Baseball Complex is considered by many to be one of the finest baseball facilities in South Florida. This fully lit complex features a playing field with two outdoor batting cages. With the excellent facilities and connections to the Frontier Independent League, the university has seen many of its players advance to the next level. As stated the facilities and connections have been a huge stepping ground into the next level for NSU Sharks Baseball players. Prior to the 2001 season, NSU added grandstand seating that accommodates 500 people and a fully functional press box. The Baseball Complex is the site of The Frontier Independent Baseball League's annual player combine and tryouts. NSU Soccer Complex The NSU Soccer Complex consists of two practice fields and one game field. The game field is home for both the men's and women's soccer teams. All three fields come equipped with lights that allow for night practices and games. The game field features state-of-the-art grandstand seating with a capacity of 1,000 spectators. The stadium style seating is the newest addition to the complex, which was built prior to the 2000 season. The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team as well as several MLS teams, including the Miami Fusion have used NSU's complex as their training site. The Orange Bowl Committee has entered into an agreement to use the NSU Soccer Complex as its official training site for one of its participants, which began with the 2003 FedEx Orange Bowl. Miami Dolphins Training Facility Miami Dolphins Training Facility The Miami Dolphins Training Facility is located on the main campus of Nova Southeastern University. The facility was brought to the campus with connections through the Miami Dolphins; for example, the owner of the team, H. Wayne Huizenga, has the school's Business College named after him. The connection between the Dolphins, Huizenga and Nova Southeastern University is deep. The state-of-the-art training facility of the Miami Dolphins football team includes one of the largest weight rooms in the NFL, training rooms, locker rooms, a therapy swimming pool, a cold-plunge pool and whirlpools, numerous administrative offices, and a practice field. It also has a bleacher building that can accommodate 2,000 spectators. The facility is frequently used as a prototype for other professional football teams. The team's famous bubble has been a staple to both the campus and to the Dolphins. This facility has been a connection for Nova Southeastern University to connect with South Florida and build a relationship through athletics beyond their campus. The facility has also been a practice facility for college football teams competing in Miami-area college bowl games. Nova Southeastern University and the Miami Dolphins have an agreement where one of the two Orange Bowl participants have the ability to practice at this facility. It has also been a host for Super Bowl teams; most recently, the Indianapolis Colts practiced there for Super Bowl XLI. Mascot Knights Nova Southeastern University's athletics were originally known as the Knights. This name dates back to when the school was just Nova University. After the school merged with Southeastern University it was looking for a new identity to emerge for its athletic teams. The merger between the schools happened in 1994 when the school was still competing in the NAIA. They remained the Knights until the 2005 season. Sharks Upon completion of their reclassification period Nova Southeastern University wanted to complete its rebranding. In 2005, the administration put together a school wide contest to help create a new name for NSU athletics. After many rounds of voting the university decided on Sharks. NSU is the one of only two college athletic teams to use the mascot Sharks with fellow Division II member Hawaii Pacific being the other. The shark mascot has become more than just an athletic logo, but also a symbol for the university. The Shark mascot has help brand Nova Southeastern University's identity.

History right Springs of sulphur water were discovered on the site in the 18th century but development of the site as a spa did not take place for over a hundred years. In 1840, the owner of the estate, Henry Wright, cleaned out and protected one of the wells and four years later built a hotel and a bath house. People were charged two shillings and six pence (nominally 12p but about £ at current prices) to bathe in the warm waters. The gardens were laid out around the bath house and in 1861 the site at Harlow Carr springs was described as: The hotel later became the Harrogate Arms but closed in 2013. In 2014 the Harrogate Arms and the land surrounding it was acquired by the RHS with plans progressing to restore the building, create new gardens around it and reintroduce its links with the old bath house. The bath house now houses the garden study centre. The building was converted in 1958 and contains a meeting room, the library and offices. The six well heads in front of the bath house have been capped off but remain beneath the present Limestone Rock Garden. At times there is a smell of sulphur in this area. The Northern Horticultural Society was founded in 1946 with the objective of: The Society leased of mixed woodland, pasture and arable land at Harlow Hill from the Harrogate Corporation and it opened the Harlow Carr Botanical Gardens in 1950. The chief aim of the venture was to set up a trial ground where the suitability of plants for growing in northern climates could be assessed. The original area has been extended to .

It is one of three species within the genus Anhydrophryne. It is endemic to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Discovery  This frog was initially discovered and described in 1919 by Dr. Rattray in the Hogsback Mountain region of the Eastern Cape, South Africa.  Range  The frog is found in the Amotola (where the type locality, Hogsback is located), Katberg and Keiskammahoek mountains. Its habitat is the floor of forests near the forest edge at an altitude greater than 1100 m. It is particularly associated with the forest–grassland ecotone.  Biology  These small frogs are light-grey to dark-brown (sometimes coppery) in colour. The adult often has a thin pale line over its head and back, with two darker bands along either side. The belly is marbled (white and dark brown to black.) The female of the species is about 21 mm long. The male is considerably smaller and may be distinguished by a horny tip on its snout. The males have a short ‘ping’ call with up to 15 repeats in rapid succession, though single ‘pings’ may also be heard. These calls are typically heard at night, though the males are also active on rainy days. The frogs live on the forest floor among damp vegetable debris, particularly near open water. Their diets are principally composed of small arthropods, e.g. forest fleas and woodlice. Eggs are large (about 2.6 mm in diameter), white, and enclosed in a jelly capsule about 6 mm in size. Up to 20 such eggs are laid in a nest chamber, the diameter of which is around 20 mm, with a 10-mm opening to the surface. The opening is covered with leaves. The male is believed to dig the nest. Unusual amongst amphibians, they have direct development where eggs develop to small froglets without free-living tadpole stage. The nest needs to remain moist for successful development. The eggs take 26 days to develop and metamorphose, at which stage they leave the nest as 4-mm froglets.  Conservation  Due to its declining natural habitat, the Hogsback frog is currently classified as endangered. References * Wager, V.

It is endemic to South Africa. Description The Bainskloof moss frog is a small frog which reaches a maximum length of 22 mm. The body is rather squat with short limbs and a rounded head. The background colour of its skin varies from orangey brown to black with darker patches and paler spots on the back and legs. Distribution The Bainskloof moss frog is endemic to Riviersonderend Mountains, Dutoitsberg, Elandskloof and Limietberg Mountains in Western Cape Province, South Africa. This species can be found between 300-2,000 m above sea level. The extent of this species total distribution is probably less than 20,000 km². Habitat The Bainskloof moss frog favours wet mossy areas near watercourses, hillside or roadside seepages, and heavily vegetated streams, within montane fynbos and frequently on steep hillsides. Its known range is situated outside the 750mm isohyet. Biology The Bainskloof moss frog begins breeding at the onset of the winter rains and the females lay small clutches of 8–10 eggs among moss or similar vegetation in seepages. The male frogs apparently guard the eggs as they call from the laying sites. The eggs hatch into fully formed tiny, 4mm, long froglets rather than tadpoles. It mainly feeds on small invertebrates. Conservation status This species is patchily distributed but widespread, in small discrete populations within the montane fynbos which is not a significantly fragmented habitat. The habitat of the Bainskloof Moss Frog lies mainly within protected areas, although even here it is threatened by the spread of pines and other alien species and too frequent bush fires.

Football is popular as are martial arts in particular. Sepak takraw, which looks like volleyball, is also a very popular sport in Cambodia. The martial arts of Bokator, pradal serey (Khmer kickboxing) and Khmer traditional wrestling are all practiced in the country. The ancient sport of Bokator 'Bokator/boxkator, or more formally, Labok Katao (which means wielding a wooden stick to fight lions), is an ancient Khmer martial art that is based on animal forms. It has ground fighting, close combat techniques and weaponry. Unlike kickboxing, which is a sport fighting art, boxkator was a soldier's art, designed to be used on the battlefield. It can be considered a complete martial art, using strikes, throws, drags, trapping, locking, and some elements of ground fighting. Every single part of the body can be used as a weapon. When fighting, bokator practitioners still wear the uniforms of ancient Khmer armies. A kroma (scarf) is folded around their waist and blue and red silk cords called sangvar day, are tied around the combatants head and biceps. In the past, it is said that the cords were enchanted to increase strength, although now they are just ceremonial. The kroma shows the fighter's level of expertise. A series of grades, each taking at least five months to complete training seven days a week and two hours a day, are represented by different colors. The first grade is white, followed by green, blue, red, brown, and then black which has 10 degrees. After completing their initial training, fighters wear a black kroma (scarf) for at least another ten years. To attain the gold kroma, you must be a true master and must have done something great for bokator. And to become a true master, it will definitely take some time as just in the unarmed portion of the art; there are between 8,000 and 10,000 different techniques; only 1,000 of which you have to learn to attain the black kroma. The art contains 341 different styles, some of which are the duck, crab, horse, bird, dragon, eagle, crane, wind, fire, water, earth (or stone), king monkey, lion, elephant, apsara (traditional Hindu sacred nymph), and crocodile. Ancient Khmer armies. In the past, it is said that the cords were enchanted to increase strength, although now they are just ceremonial. Because of its visually similar style, bokator (boxkator) is commonly wrongly described as a variant of modern kickboxing. Bokator has many forms based on styles as well as straight practical fighting techniques. While pradal serey is a more simplified freestyle fighting system which uses a few of the basic (white kroma) punching, elbow, kicking, and kneeing techniques. Pradal Serey Pradal serey, or Traditional Khmer kickboxing, is a popular sport in Cambodia. A match consists of five sets of three-minute rounds and takes place in a 6.1 meter square boxing ring. A one- or two-minute break occurs between each round. At the beginning of each match, boxers practice the praying rituals known as the Kun Kru. Traditional Cambodian music is played during the match. The music is played using the instruments of the skor yaul (a type of drum), the sraliai (a flute like instrument), and the stringed chhing. Boxers wear leather gloves and shorts. Rules: * A boxer is not allowed to strike his opponent while he is on the ground. * A boxer is not allowed to bite. * When an opponent can not fight anymore, the referee stops the fight. * Blows to the back of the opponent are not allowed. * A boxer may not hold on to the ropes. * Blows to the genitals are prohibited. Victory can be obtained by knockout. A knockout occurs when a boxer is knocked down to the ground and can not continue fighting after a 10-second count by the referee. Victory is also obtained from the end of the match, when judges decide by a point system which fighter was more effective. If fighters end up with the same score, a draw is called. History The combat between Vāli and Sugrīva is depicted on the western gopura of the Banteay Srei (967 A.D.) The Khmer Empire was founded in 802 A.D. at a time when many modern Southeast Asian countries didn't exist yet. Martial arts were used by the military of the Khmer Empire. Pradal Serey has its root from the hand to hand combat use by the military of the Khmer Empire. Pradal serey became a sport, during the days of the Colonial Cambodia. When the French came, they added western boxing gloves, weight classes, timed rounds, and a boxing ring to civilize the art. Originally matches were fought in dirt pits with limited rules while hands were wrapped in rope. The Near Extinction of Pradal Serey On April 17, 1975, during the chaos of the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge overthrew Lon Nol's pro-Western government, which was crumbling after America left the Vietnam War. The Khmer Rouge's plan was to eliminate modern society and create an agrarian utopia.Sites, Kevin. July 18, 2006. Year Zero , Yahoo.com (retrieved November 5, 2006) The Khmer Rouge executed most educated people, people who had ties to the old government, and anyone who was believed to be a threat (doctors, teachers, soldiers, actors, singers, etc.), and restricted the remaining Cambodian population to what were effectively labor camps. Pradal serey was banned under the Khmer Rouge regime, and many boxers were executed, nearly causing the art to be wiped out. In January 1979, the Vietnamese, along with a token force of Khmers led by ex-Khmer Rouge officers, overthrew the Khmer Rouge. Thereafter pradal serey was gradually revived. Pradal Serey Today Pradal serey is making a strong comeback since its banishment back in the 1970s. Numerous gyms have opened and large masses of students, local and foreign, have come to train in Cambodia. There are weekly matches held, in which many are televised, and many of Cambodia's best have traveled internationally to compete. There are currently about 70 boxing clubs.

A round may be won by forcing an opponent to his back. A wrestler wins the match by winning two of the three rounds. After each round, the loser is asked if he wishes to continue with the match. Wrestlers participate in pre-match ritual dancing before the match. The match is accompanied by the music of two drums (called Skor Ngey and Chhmol, \\"female drum\\" and \\"male drum\\").

His popularity and four-octave range earned him the nickname \\"The King\\".  Career  Zámbó started his singing career in the Hungarian State Radio Children's Choir. Between 1982 and 1986 he worked in the US on the club circuit before returning to Hungary. His breakthrough came in the early 1990s, when he was voted Hungary's singer of the year in 1993. His 2000 album Christmas With Jimmy had been Hungary's top-selling record for many weeks before his death. All his albums have gone platinum. Between March 2000 and his death he hosted his own popular show on commercial TV station RTL Klub.  Death  Jimmy Zámbó's tomb in Budapest, Csepel cemetery Zámbó died on January 2, 2001, by a gunshot wound to the head. Budapest police said that he leaned out of a window and fired two shots from his 9mm Beretta at a neighbor's rooster whose crowing was disturbing his sleep, in an effort to scare it away. Then, to show his wife that there were no more bullets in the gun, he removed the magazine, put it to his head and pulled the trigger. However, there was a bullet still in the chamber, which fired and struck him in the temple. He was taken to the hospital, where he died hours later. He had consumed alcohol, though not an excessive amount. No drugs were found in his body. It was ruled as an accidental death. Whether or not he is actually deceased is debatable as eyewitnesses categorically stated seeing him alive and well in Argentina.

It is endemic to South Africa. Anhydrophryne ngongoniensis inhabit montane forest and, to a lesser extent, high-altitude grassland. The habitat of this species is being lost rapidly because of afforestation, the spread of invasive wattle trees, and inappropriate fire regimes. Distribution This tiny frog is restricted to an extremely small range, on grassy slopes in indigenous grasses of hills facing the ocean. The eastern escarpment of the Drakensberg Mountains is on the windward side and receives cool moist air so that it could be said to be in a permanent mist belt. It hides in the base of grass tussocks. Description and discovery It is small (1.6–1.8 cm) sandy/golden brown frog with four broken stripes of darker brown down the back extending onto the limbs. A very distinct fifth line runs from the tip of the snout through the eyes and ear to just behind the tympanum. The frog was discovered serendipitously by P Bishop whilst carrying out his doctoral research on Hyperolius phonotaxis and the type specimens were first taken at Ixopo KZN. It is a cryptic species identified from others by its call. Bishop noticed the call whilst listening for and taking recordings of frog calls. It was originally described in the genus Arthroleptella. It was placed in Anhydrophryne by Darrel Frost in 2012. Voice, courtship and breeding The male calls from the base of grass tussocks during the day in poor light and from more exposed or elevated positions at night. It emits a shrill cricket like call. As the name of the genus implies it breeds and lays eggs without the need for standing water. About a dozen large opaque eggs are laid that develop into fully formed translucent froglets (0.4 cm long) in 27–28 days. Conservation This species due its tiny distribution and habitat range is vulnerable. The habitat is being lost rapidly because of afforestation, including the spread of invasive wattle trees, bush-fires and inappropriate fire regimes. References * Passmore, N. & Carruthers, V.

It is endemic to South Africa and only known from the Groot Winterhoek Wilderness Area, Western Cape. Common name northern moss frog has been coined for it. The specific name subvoce is Latin for \\"under voice\\" and refers to the very subdued male advertisement call of this frog. Description Adult males measure and adult females, based on the only female in the type series, in snout–vent length. The snout is bluntly rounded. The pupil is horizontal. The limbs are short and the fingers and toes lack webbing; the toe tips are very slightly expanded. Skin is smooth but there is a pair of slightly elevated, elongated dorsolateral glandular patches. The dorsum has brown ground colour. There is a pair of para-vertebral and a pair of dorso-lateral series of dark brown blotches or bands, the latter sometimes indistinct. The upper lip has a few white flecks. There is dark band running from behind the eye to the insertion of the forelimb. The upper surface of the upper forelimb is orange- brown. The ventrum is pale with some speckling. The call comprises a pulsed chirp of 4–6 pulses and is followed by 2–6 evenly spaced double clicks, often ending with one or two single pulse clicks. Habitat and conservation Arthroleptella subvoce occurs in thickly vegetated seeps dominated by restios within montane fynbos at elevations of above sea level. Males call from the bases of dense restio clumps. The species is known from three localities within the Groot Winterhoek Wilderness Area. While its range falls almost entirely in this protected area, it is threatened by habitat loss and deterioration caused by fires and alien plants. One of the localities is close to human residences, making contamination of water a potential threat.

Elgon torrent frog, or the Kenya rocky river frog (Arthroleptides dutoiti) is a species of frog in the family Petropedetidae endemic to Mount Elgon in Kenya; it has not been found on the Ugandan part of the mountain. It is one of many, often taxonomically unrelated, frogs referred to as torrent frogs. The species was found by Cornelius Albertus du Toit, who collected the frog holotype in 1934. Dr. du Toit was a member of the Cape Town University, a founder member of the Zoological Society of South Africa, and Professor of Zoology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. He wrote Zoological research in South Africa in 1961. Description A. dutoiti is a small frog, about in length. Its head is slightly broader than long, with distinctly visible tympana. The toes but not the fingers are half-webbed. The skin of the back is distinctly warty and pitted, but smooth elsewhere. This species is black in colour, except for the digit tips that are slightly white-edged. Habitat A. dutoiti is found in and around rocky montane streams. Eggs are laid on wet rocks close to torrential streams and waterfalls, and the tadpoles develop on the rocks, out of the water. Conservation A. dutoiti is an EDGE species, reflecting its evolutionary distinctness and endangered status. It was last seen in 1962, despite later surveys. Because the habitat of this species appears to be generally in good condition, its disappearance might have been caused by disease such as chytridiomycosis.

The founding dates of the mines are unknown, but they both closed and joined forces when they reopened in 1810. The Wheal Concord Silver, Lead and Copper Mining Company Limited was formed in 1860, but due to a drop in the tin market, the mining company closed a few years later. Regarding the late nineteenth century fall of tin prices, Herbert Thomas said of St Agnes mining in his 1896 \\"Cornish Mining Interviews\\": In 1980 Nicholas Warrell, having secured £500,000 in investment monies, and Jack Trounson reopened the mines and produced 21,000 tonnes of tin. The year after opening they received a visit from Prince Charles. The mine was only open for a few years, but they had extracted all that they could with their contributors' investments. Wheal Concord was unable to secure the investment of £4,000,000 for machinery and resources to access resources deeper underground and had to close their business in 1986.Blackwater.

This was the first of many donated public buildings by Edwards. He also financed the construction of the Mithian Village Hall, St Agnes village Miners' and Mechanics' Institute and 69 other public buildings. Edwards was a successful newspaper owner but his beginnings were humble. The idea for the institute sprouted from a request for books for Blackwater's citizens by the Reverend of the Mithian church, Fursdon Rogers. Based upon the Reverend's request and his own memories of having joined the Chacewater Reading Society to access reading material, Edwards decided to build a building for educational study.Blackwater.

Description The most reliable account of the táltos is given by Roman Catholic priest Arnold Ipolyi in his collection of folk beliefs, Magyar mitológia (Hungarian mythology) (1854). A táltos would be chosen by the gods or spirits before birth or during childhood. People with teeth at birth, a sixth finger or other additional bones, or with a caul were also often considered to be chosen.Hungarian mythology If the extra bone broke or was stolen before the táltos turned 7, its abilities would be lost. Being a táltos could not be learned or taught; it could only happen through supernatural calling. Some beliefs hold that a táltos would have to be breastfed until it turned 7, which would grant it immense physical strength. (An example of this occurs in the archaic folk tale \\"Son of the White Mare\\".) The most important ability of a táltos is a meditation or spiritual trance called \\"révülés\\" (verb: révül); in this state, he could heal wounds and sickness or learn hidden truths by \\"sending their soul among the stars\\". The táltos was chosen by gods or spirits for a specific calling in life and had the duty to communicate with the entire Hungarian nation in a time of danger, to warn against invading armies or an impending cultural collapse. Pagans According to general consensus, the táltos were considered as part of pagan religion. There is evidence, though, that the táltos existed until the Habsburg era, when this tradition came to an end. The painted ceiling of the church of Székelyderzsi had a figure with six fingers; this was later renovated, \\"correcting\\" the picture to five fingers.Diószeghy: Élő hagyomány Hungarian Native Faith Ceremony Post-Christianism Jesus Christ would sometimes be referred to as the égi táltos (or heavenly táltos).Collection from Sándor Bosnyák Origin of the word The name \\"Táltos\\" is of unknown origin, but most probably correlating to \\"tált\\", which is to \\"open wide\\"; i.e. they \\"opened themselves to the world.\\" Other theories state it comes from Uralic taitaa meaning \\"to know, understand\\" or from the derivative of Turkish talt meaning \\"unconsciousness\\". Göncöl and Kampó In Hungarian folk tales táltos are common, such as Göncöl and Kampó. Kampó was said to have had an \\"ice body\\" (\\"jégtestű\\") and was short with thick legs. He lived in Temesvár (present-day Timișoara), ate lunch in Buda at the same table as King Matthias and was always poorly dressed. King Matthias was asked several times why a pauper was eating at the same table as the king, but King Matthias insisted on this tradition. When the Turkish army attacked the Kingdom of Hungary, Kampó reportedly spilled fire from his mouth and he \\"fought with his iced body against Turkish metal\\", redeeming a \\"moonlike\\" (\\"holdas\\"= \\"eclipse\\") horse of King Matthias from the Turks. Göncöl, (also Döncöl, Güncü) on the other hand, had tremendous knowledge. He spoke with animals, understood the meanings of the stars, and invented the horse-coach. He was said to have a coach which was pulled by multiple horses that reportedly had its perch broken and bent. His death was not witnessed, but instead it was said that he simply \\"disappeared into the stars\\". The \\"coach of Göncöl\\" is visible in the night sky as Ursa Major (the \\"Great Bear\\"), where the tail of the bear is the perch of the coach. References in historiography In the Chronicle of the Hungarians by Johannes de Thurocz, Attila of the Huns asked several táltos to foresee the outcome of Battle of Chalons, where they predicted that the war would be lost. They based their predictions on the intestines of animals, but how the actual prediction is done is not known. The heritage of táltos kings can be found in several parts of Hungary and are linked mainly to kings of the Árpád dynasty. The most important is the chivalrous King Ladislaus; the name of his horse was Szög. One legend says, that St. Stephen went hunting, but grew tired and took a nap under a tree. He had a dream (or révülés/meditation) of speaking with the head of the Pecheneg army. When he woke up, he knew they were preparing to attack, and he could take action to protect the country. According to this legend, St Stephen himself was a táltos. These folk tales may have arisen later and not in the time of these pious Christian kings. From the times of Matthias Corvinus, Galeotto Marzio writes: \\"you had a man of six fingers in your father's court\\". The horse of Matthias was \\"moonly\\" (holdas), referring to it as táltos horse. There was a lawsuit in 1725, in Debrecen, where Erzsébet Balázsi, a well-known táltos at that time, was accused of being a witch. The court asked her to explain the role of táltos. She replied: the táltos cures, sees buried treasures with the naked eye, and \\"the táltos are fighting for Hungary in heaven\\". There is a common belief that King Stephen has persecuted the táltos during Christianisation of Hungary, but this is not linked to any fact. When pagan revolts started in 1046 and 1061 there were enough táltos for the leaders to choose for their court. The \\"táltos horse\\" The táltos horse or steed (\\"táltos paripa\\") is the mount of the táltos, and also a stock character in Hungarian folk tales.Jones, W. Henry; Kropf, Lajos L.; Kriza, János. The folk-tales of the Magyars. London: Pub. for the Folk-lore society by E. Stock. 1889. pp. 345-346. (Here, \\"táltos\\" typically refers to the power of the horse and not necessarily its association with a shaman, though some folk heroes are identified as táltos themselves.) The táltos steed would typically appear at first to the protagonist (usually a peasant's son, adventuring prince, or a youngest son) disguised as an old and ugly jade. If it is treated well, it would ask the hero to feed it hot cinders, whereupon its transform into a steed with golden coat, golden saddles and five or six legs. In this form it could fly with the protagonist on its back; its speed is mandatorily described as \\"faster than a bird\\", \\"faster than wind\\", and finally \\"faster than thought\\". (As with Hungarian dragons and their heads, the number of legs may appear as other mythical numbers and the coat as other noble metals (in the usual order copper, silver and gold); a higher number/nobler metal implying greater power.) According to some experts, the táltos horse is a symbol of the drum of the táltos. They heated it over fire (see hot cinders) to make it suitable to play and used the drum to meditate (fly away).Az uráli sámánizmus és a magyar táltoshit References * External links * A Nagy- és Kis Göncöl és a Sarkcsillag (html and pdf) by Várhegyi Péter, part of MCSE's pages about history of astronomy See also * Hungarian mythology * Hungarian shamanism * Hungarian neopaganism Category:Hungarian mythology ","title":"Táltos"},{"id":"12400444","text":"The micro frog (Microbatrachella capensis), or Cape Flats frog, is a species of frog less than long in the family Pyxicephalidae, in the monotypic genus Microbatrachella.

Dirck Tulp visited Moscovia with his father-in-law; he was painted in 1653 by Paulus Potter. Life In 1647, Dirck accompanied Albert Burgh, son of a brewer and former mayor of Amsterdam, on his mission to Russia, to build up trade connections, especially in grain. Dirck Tulp married Anna Burgh in 1650, daughter of the late Burgh. The couple lived initially on Kloveniersburgwal 65, a building given to Anna by her family. This house had been used for dying silk since 1603. The silk was imported from Persia, and shipped, either through Archangelsk or the Strait of Gibraltar. A pair of fashionable Flemish ladies had headed it, its activities occurring in its light and airy attics. Over the years, the operation was largely moved to the Jordaan. When Tulp and his wife began building-work in 1652, they had the building embellished with stucco and the floor laid with marble. The Kloveniersburgwal was an attractive site for the rich, being close to the nerve center of the VOC, in which Tulp was appointed as delegate. Anna Burgh also owned a summer residence (hofstede) at the Amstel, named \\"Klein Kostverloren\\", that was renamed \\"Tulpenburgh\\" (combining both family names).Castles in Holland They used their summer residence, like many families at the time, to get out of town during the summer, to avoid the urban stench, noise and the plague that was decimating the cities population during that period. In 1652 Paulus Potter came to Amsterdam on Nicolaes Tulp's invitation. Dirck received a painting, that was initially meant to be for someone else – Potter only repainted the head. Around the same time, his half-sister Margaretha Tulp broke off an engagement with Johan de Witt, one of the most influential Dutch politicians of that time, and married Jan Six instead. Tulp family tree Dirck and Anna (also painted by the German, Jurriaen Ovens) moved to Kloveniersburgwal 47 in 1669. Dirck's wife died in 1672 and Tulp left for England, visiting his wife's cousin, the diplomat Coenraad van Beuningen. Despite his many contacts, Dirck Tulp never became mayor. Tulp was named by mayor Gillis Valckenier \\"an ignorant vain man\\", after his two year stay out of the country, during which he sent back no letters. In 1675 Tulp was to be dismissed, but he changed his lifestyle and prevented dismissal. In 1676, he was made a baronet by Charles II, paying a large amount of money. He was appointed as colonel in the Schutterij, the Dutch volunteer city guard. As a widower, he remarried Katharina Resteau. From that marriage came four children, but both sons, twins, died young. His second wife was painted twice. With the death of Dirck Tulp the male line of the Tulp family died out. Dirck's daughter would later marry the mayor of Amsterdam, and specialist in trade with Russia, Nicolaes Witsen.

Habitat and conservation Petropedetes newtonii is known from scattered locations on Bioko from near sea level to above sea level and from coastal Cameroon. Adults are found in and near streams (within two meters distance), but juveniles might occur away from water. Specimens can be found on stream banks, rocks, or low in vegetation, but occasionally perched as high as above the water. The conservation status of Petropedetes newtonii, as currently defined, has not been assessed.

It is known from a few localities in southwestern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and western Gabon. Common name Efulen water frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–urostyle length. The body is robust. The snout is relatively more pointed than in other Petropedetes. The tympanum is very small and indistinct whereas the supratympanic fold is distinct. The fingers are slender and have typically T-shaped tips. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are fully webbed. The dorsum is uniformly dark green and black with some tiny pale spots. Adults can be glossy black and difficult to see among wet stones. The upper hinds limbs have faint crossbars. The throat is whitish or dark marbled. The tadpoles are flat-bodied with large eyes and a long, pointed tail. They are grey, turning darker with age, but translucent ventrally. The largest tadpoles are in total length. Habitat and conservation Petropedetes palmipes occurs in rocky areas in lowland forest, usually near flowing water, at elevations up to above sea level. The eggs are clued to rocks outside water, although eggs and tadpoles have also been found submerged. Petropedetes palmipes is a rare species that does not tolerate much modification of its forest habitat. It is, presumably, threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture, logging and human settlements. It is found in the Monte Alen National Park in Equatorial Guinea and in the Crystal Mountains National Park in Gabon.

It is found in western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. Records from Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are uncertain, possibly belonging to Petropedetes euskircheni. P. parkeri is named after Hampton Wildman Parker, a British zoologist and herpetologist from the Natural History Museum, London. Common names Parker's water frog and Parker's torrent frog have been proposed for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–urostyle length (SUL); females are on average smaller than males (respectively SUL). The body is robust. The tympanum is distinct, usually larger than the eye in males but always smaller than the eye in females. The snout is short and rounded. The fingers are slender. The toes have rudimentary webbing. The dorsum and the sides are olive or brownish, marbled with diffuse brown-olive spots. The throat is dirty whitish while the belly is whitish, slightly translucent. The femora and lower legs have large darker spots divided by thin, bright coloured transversal bars. The iris is golden with white-green shades. Habitat and conservation Information on the ecology of Petropedetes parkeri suffers from uncertain species identifications. All confirmed records are from below above sea level. It appears to be a forest dweller, although during the breeding season, adults aggregate on humid rocky surfaces near torrents. The eggs are deposited on stones within the splash zone. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists P. parkeri, in the sense of also including populations from Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, as being of \\"least concern\\" because of its relatively wide distribution, presumed large total population, and low likelihood that it is declining fast enough to qualify for a more threatened category. It is probably suffering from some habitat loss. It occurs in the Korup National Park in Cameroon.

Etymology The specific name perreti honours , a Swiss herpetologist who has specialized in African amphibians. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length; it is a medium-sized member of its genus. The body is slender. The tympanum is distinct and nearly as large as the eye in males but distinctly smaller in females. The canthus rostralis is distinct but slightly rounded. The dorsum is brownish or greenish marbled with black parts, or more or less uniformly dark, and speckled with white minuscule spots. The hands are unwebbed whereas the feet are fully webbed. Habitat and conservation Petropedetes perreti is a forest species that occurs along mountain streams at elevations of above sea level, or even higher. Adults have been found adhering with their bellies and limbs to stones in strong currents, sitting on stones amidst the river or some meters away from water, and on leaves of plants on the river sides. The egg clutches are deposited on rocks within the splash zone of rapids and waterfalls. The male appears to defend its clutch. The tadpoles can feed in the splash zone and only move to the water when disturbed. It is a common species but threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture, logging, and human settlements.

The IUCN Red List includes the following West African countries (in alphabetic order): Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Etymology The common name of this species refers to its describer, German zoologst Ernst Ahl. The formerly recognized Phrynobatrachus vogti, or Vogt's river frog, is named for Theodor Vogt (1881–1932), a German naturalist. Description Phrynobatrachus latifrons are short-lived frogs that reach sexual maturity at the age of 4–5 months and live only for further two months. Their body size is small: males grow to a snout–vent length of and females to . They are characterized by moderate webbing in their toes (also considered well- developed), absence of eyelid spine, lack of enlarged discs of finger and toes, and a yellow throat in breeding males. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus latifrons is an extremely common species. It inhabits wooded and open savanna, secondary forest, degraded former forest, agricultural areas, and inselbergs in rainforest, but avoids closed primary rainforest.

Their common name is puddle frogs, dwarf puddle frogs, African puddle frogs, or African river frogs. The common name, puddle frog, refers to the fact that many species breed in temporary waterbodies such as puddles. Phrynobatrachus are among the most common amphibians in Africa. They are typically small (mostly less than ), fast-moving frogs. They occupy a variety of habitats from dry savannas to rainforests. Most species deposit many small eggs as a surface clutch in standing or slowly moving water and have exotrophic tadpoles. Taxonomy Phrynobatrachidae has earlier been considered as a subfamily of Ranidae, but its recognition as a family is now well-established. It is probably most closely related to Petropedetidae and Pyxicephalidae or Ptychadenidae. This large genus may be further divided into three major clades. These clades could be treated as different genera, but this arrangement is not yet in use.

It is widely distributed in the lowlands of eastern Africa, from Kenya and southern Somalia in the north and southward to Tanzania (including the Mafia, Zanzibar, and Pemba islands), Malawi, Mozambique, eastern Zimbabwe, and easternmost South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal). Its range might extend into Swaziland in the south and westward to Uganda and Zambia. This widespread species has also many vernacular names: East African puddle frog, small puddle frog, eastern puddle frog, Zanzibar puddle frog, Zanzibar river frog, Mababe toad-frog, and Cope's toad-frog. It is morphologically and genetically most similar to Phrynobatrachus pakenhami, its sister species. However, the specific name acridoides appears to refer to its superficial similarity to the North American cricket frog Acris gryllus, of no close relation (family Hylidae). Description Males can reach a maximum snout–vent length of and females , depending on the source. The tympanum is round and typically visible. The snout is narrowed, rounded, and somewhat prominent. The toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum is greyish-olive or greyish-brown. This species exhibits a number of different color morphs; a narrow pale or green vertebral band is often present. The limbs are barred. The venter is white but has a yellowish hue near the groin and a pale stripe occurs on the back of the thigh. The throat and breast are white and have brown punctuations, or are generally darkened (in both sexes). Males have a vocal sac. The male advertisement call has been characterized as \\"a coarse, rasping croak\\", \\"a continual harsh creaking snore\\", or \\"cricket-like\\". Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus acridoides occurs in dry and humid savanna, shrubland, grassland, and coastal habitats. It adapts to habitat modification. Breeding takes place in mostly temporary but also permanent waterbodies, such as puddles, pools, swamps, vleis, roadside ditches, and flooded grassy depressions. The eggs are mostly laid in aquatic vegetation below the water surface. This species can be predated by snakes Psammophis sibilans and Thelotornis capensis. It is an adaptable, common, and sometimes abundant species that is not facing significant threats. Nevertheless, it seems to have declined in its range margin in South Africa for reasons that are not clear. It is present in many protected areas.

Contrary to what is generally believed, Plutarch, in his Parallel Lives biography of Mark Antony, writes that Charmion managed the principal affairs of Cleopatra's government therefore, she held an important position in Cleopatra's trusted circle. Plutarch In his Parallel Lives biography of Mark Antony, Plutarch noted that Augustus Caesar \\"had a decree made, declaring war on Cleopatra, and depriving Antony of the authority which he had let a woman exercise in his place. Caesar added that [Antony] had drunk potions that had bereaved him of his senses, and that the generals they would have to fight with would be Mardion the eunuch, Pothinus, Iras, Cleopatra's hairdressing girl, and Charmion, who were Antony's chief state-councillors.\\" Plutarch. \\"Life of Antony.\\" - WikiSource.org Plutarch later described the scene after Cleopatra's suicide: > The messengers came at full speed, and found the guards apprehensive of > nothing; but on opening the doors, they saw her stone-dead, lying upon a bed > of gold, set out in all her royal ornaments.

Shakespeare Charmion has been dramatized numerous times alongside Cleopatra, most notably in William Shakespeare's tragedy Antony and Cleopatra (as \\"Charmian\\" or ).

Jean Byron was Charmion in 1953's Serpent of the Nile, and Elizabeth Taylor's 1963 Cleopatra had Isabel Cooley in the role of Charmian. Mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias portrayed Charmian in the initial run of Samuel Barber's 1966 opera Antony and Cleopatra, based on Shakespeare's play.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Ukrainian literature of the early 1960s. By the opinion of the Museum of dissident movement in Kyiv, the works and early death of Vasyl Symonenko had an enormous impact on the rise of the national democratic movement in Ukraine.Museum of dissident movement in Kiev. Biography The poet was born in a peasant family in the village of Biyivtsi, Kharkiv Oblast (today - Poltava Oblast). After graduating from Kiev State University in 1957, Vasyl Symonenko worked as a journalist in several newspapers in Cherkasy Oblast. His debut book of poems \\"Tysha i hrim\\" (\\"Silence and thunder\\") was published in 1962 and made the talent of Symonenko clear among the young poets. His literary environment included the poets Mykola Vinhranovsky, Ivan Drach and Lina Kostenko, the publicists, critics Ivan Dziuba, Ivan Svitlichny, Y. Sverstyuk, who, with other Ukrainian intilligensia of the time, made a group which is now called шістдестятники (Sixtiers).Encyclopedia of Ukraine During his last year of living Vasyl Symonenko wrote his second book – \\"Земне тяжіння\\" (\\"Earth’s gravity\\"), the verses from which were quoted, written out (adding what the Soviet censorship had omitted), learned by heart and compared with the poetry of Taras Shevchenko. In 1962, Symonenko together with his friends A.Horska and Les Tanyuk found the burial places of NKVD repressions in Bykivnia, Lukianivskyi and Vasyslkivskyi cemeteries near Kiev. For the fact he appealed to the Kiev City Council, which, according to some scholars, could have caused him falling out of favor among the government, and, possibly, his death. In 1963 Symonenko was beaten by employees of the local militsiya at the Smila railway station from which he suffered kidney failure and soon died in the local hospital on December 13, 1963. Already after his death there was published his satiric tale-poem \\"Travel to the country of Vice-versa\\" (1964). The fullest collection of Symonenko's works was published abroad under the title \\"Берег чекань\\" (\\"Shore of anticipation\\") in Munich (1963).

His highest rank was maegashira 12. Career He was a schoolfriend of future yokozuna Akebono. He made his professional debut in November 1990, joining Magaki stable. Yamato reached the salaried sekitori ranks in March 1995 when he was promoted to the jūryō division. He reached the top makuuchi division in January 1997, the first wrestler from his stable to do so since it was re-established in 1983. He chalked up a winning record of 8–7 in his debut and was ranked there for seven tournaments. He was forced to sit out the March 1998 tournament with a life- threatening bout of pneumonia which sent him down to jūryō. Still not fully recovered in May, he turned in a disastrous 1–14 record and fell to the unsalaried makushita division. Just before the July tournament he was hit by a car and was forced to withdraw once again. This sent him down to the bottom of makushita. After a 5–2 score in September he decided to retire rather than face another long struggle back up the rankings, and started up his own restaurant, Kama'āina's, in Tokyo's Roppongi district. Although Yamato never rose high enough in the rankings to face a yokozuna in tournament competition, he once defeated Takanohana eight times in a row in training. Fighting style Yamato specialised in pushing and thrusting techniques, rarely fighting on the mawashi, and his two favourite kimarite were tsukidashi, or thrust out, and oshidashi, or push out. Family His brother Glenn, one year younger than George, also joined Magaki stable two months after Yamato, competing under the shikona of Ōnami 男波 (later Wakachikara 若力). He was the same height as Yamato but considerably lighter at around 110 to 126 kg. In May 1993 he was ranked higher than his elder brother at Makushita 26, but was injured in the September 1993 tournament and dropped significantly in rank. He retired in November 1994, a few months before Yamatō's jūryō debut. A third Kalima brother, Kalani, was also interested in joining sumo but was unable to find a stable and instead became a practitioner of Hawaiian martial arts.

All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 264 seats in the Senate. After four years of growing bipolarisation of Spanish politics, the election saw a record result for both ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and opposition People's Party (PP), together obtaining more than 83% of the vote share—over 21 million votes—and 92% of the Congress seats. The PSOE under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero benefitted from tactical voting against the PP and emerged as the most-voted party just 7 seats short of an overall majority. On the other hand, Mariano Rajoy's PP saw an increase in its vote share and seat count but remained unable to overtake the Socialists. United Left (IU) had its worst general election performance ever with less than 4% and 2 seats. Regional nationalist parties Convergence and Union (CiU), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) or Aragonese Union (CHA) were also hurt by the massive tactical voting towards the PSOE, falling to historical lows of popular support. Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD), with 1 seat and slightly more than 300,000 votes, became the first nationwide party aside from PSOE, PP and IU entering in parliament in over two decades. Zapatero was sworn in as Prime Minister of Spain for a second term in office in April 2008, just as the Spanish economy began showing signs of fatigue and economic slowdown after a decade of growth. Overview Electoral system The Spanish Cortes Generales were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a prime minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive, yet limited in number functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress' override. Voting for the Cortes Generales was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of their political rights. For the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain, with each being allocated an initial minimum of two seats and the remaining 248 being distributed in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting. The use of the D'Hondt method might result in a higher effective threshold, depending on the district magnitude. For the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants. Election date The term of each chamber of the Cortes Generales—the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of the Cortes in the event that the prime minister did not make use of his prerogative of early dissolution. The decree was to be published on the following day in the Official State Gazette (BOE), with election day taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication. The previous election was held on 14 March 2004, which meant that the legislature's term would expire on 14 March 2008. The election decree was required to be published in the BOE no later than 19 February 2008, with the election taking place on the fifty- fourth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the Cortes Generales on Sunday, 13 April 2008. The prime minister had the prerogative to dissolve both chambers at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both chambers were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a prime minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections for the Congress and the Senate, there being no precedent of separate elections and with governments having long preferred that elections for the two chambers of the Cortes take place simultaneously. The Cortes Generales were dissolved on 15 January 2008, after it was announced by Andalusian president Manuel Chaves in November 2007 that he had agreed with Zapatero to hold the 2008 Spanish general election and the regional election in Andalusia simultaneously on 9 March. Parliamentary status The Cortes Generales were officially dissolved on 15 January 2008, after the publication of the dissolution decree in the Official State Gazette.

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election: {  style=\\"line-height:1.35em; font- size:95%; text-align:left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Candidacy ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Parties and alliances ! colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Leading candidate ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Ideology ! colspan=\\"3\\" Previous result ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" - !

In the Valencian Community, Valencian People's Initiative (IdPV)—splinter from United Left of the Valencian Country (EUPV)—joined a coalition with the Valencian Nationalist Bloc (Bloc) and The Greens–Ecologist Left of the Valencian Country (EVEE). Unity for the Isles, an electoral alliance based in the Balearic Islands, was formed by PSM–Nationalist Agreement (PSM–EN), Majorcan Union (UM), Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Agreement for Majorca (ExM) and The Greens of Menorca (EV–Me).

The campaign was linked to terms like equality (Igualdad-Igualdaz) or solidarity (Solidaridad-Solidaridaz), emphasizing the policies carried out by the current government. The second phase was done under the slogan \\"La Mirada Positiva\\" (The Positive outlook), emphasising the future government platform, and \\"Vota con todas tus fuerzas\\" (Vote with all of your strength), aiming to mobilize the indecisive or potentially abstaining voters. Another common slogan through all the campaign was \\"Motivos para creer\\" (Reasons to believe in). ;PP For the pre-campaign the PP used the slogan \\"Con Rajoy es Posible\\" (With Rajoy it's Possible). Usually emphasizing PP's campaign proposals, such as \\"Llegar a fin de mes, Con Rajoy es Posible\\" (Making ends meet, With Rajoy it's Possible). IU accused PP of copying its slogan from the last municipal electionsEl PP copia el Lema de IU en su Ultima Campaña , Público, 23/11/2007 ;IU IU chose the pre- campaign slogan \\"LlamazarES + Más Izquierda\\" (LlamazarES (is) More Left), calling attention to their position as the third national party. Campaign issues The economy became a major campaign issue due to a number of factors: * A slowing down in the housing market, with prices even beginning to fall in some areas. * Sharp increases in prices of some basic commodities. * Global instability as a result of market uncertainty. * A rise in unemployment. The sudden emergence of the economy as a political issue came after several years of steady economic growth, and led some observers to suggest that maybe the government would have benefitted from calling an earlier election. In addition to those factors both the PP and the PSOE made competing proposals on taxation.

His highest rank was maegashira 2. He was the third foreign-born wrestler to reach the top makuuchi division after Takamiyama and Konishiki. However he quit sumo suddenly in September 1988 after an argument with the head coach of Takasago stable about his persistent drinking problem. He subsequently had a brief spell as a professional wrestler with New Japan. Career Born in Apia, Western Samoa, he joined Takasago stable in 1984, after he responded to a TV recruitment campaign placed by a Japanese businessman. He was picked out of a group of around 300 youths by the former sekiwake Takamiyama. Another Samoan, Nanyozakura (Fofoga Faaleva), joined at the same time. Sapa was given the fighting name of Nankairyū, or \\"South Seas dragon.\\" Although he was not unusually large for sumo he was a superb athlete and was dedicated to training. He was highly thought of by his stable-mate Konishiki and also yokozuna Chiyonofuji, who saw that Nankairyū had a similar physique to himself and sought him out to train with. In 1987 he fought the Taiwanese wrestler Tochinohana in the jūryō division, which according to the Japan Sumo Association was the first ever bout between two foreign sekitori. In November 1987 he became the third non-Asian sumo wrestler, after Takamiyama and Konishiki, to reach the top makuuchi division. In May 1988 he reached his highest rank of maegashira 2 and upset ōzeki Hokuten'yū. He also looked to have defeated yokozuna Ōnokuni but a rematch was called, which he lost. Nankairyū was a heavy drinker, and received adverse publicity after he got into a confrontation with a hotel clerk while drunk in July 1987. His problem was made worse by the fact that he spoke neither English nor Japanese well, needing a Samoan interpreter around his stable, and consequently he had difficulty making himself understood to the Japanese media. On the 14th day of the September 1988 tournament he withdrew claiming a stomach complaint, but in fact he had drunk so much the night before he was in no condition to compete. He had a heated argument with his stable boss, former yokozuna Asashio Tarō III, who told him to choose between sumo and the bottle, and Nankairyū fled the stable to go back to Samoa. The head of the Sumo Association Futagoyama, declared that Nankairyū would never be allowed to compete again even if he did return. Nankairyū remained listed on the banzuke for the November 1988 tournament as retirement papers were not forwarded until October, after the new rankings were drawn up. This oversight prevented Hananofuji from taking Nankairyū's top division spot, as he was moved from jūryō 1 West to jūryō 1 East instead. (Hananofuji was never to reach makuuchi in his career.) His stablemaster died of a stroke just a few weeks after Nankairyū ran away, on October 23, 1988. Nankairyu told a Japanese weekly newspaper after he had returned to Western Samoa that \\"there are too many rules in sumo. After a match, you go back to the stable and all they do is order you around like a child.\\" After sumo Nankairyū became a professional wrestler for New Japan in 1990, joining Tatsumi Fujinami's \\"Dragon Bomber\\" unit with Takashi Iizuka and Taylor Wily, but soon returned to Western Samoa after no success in the business.

Accessed 2013-02-10. Other sources state that he was born in 1895 and that he died in 1944; Allmusic gives a date of 1970. was an African American vaudeville singer, stage designer and comedian, popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Life and career He was born in Montgomery, Alabama, orphaned, and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. His nickname of \\"Half Pint\\" referred to his 5'2\\" height. He started in show business around 1910 as a singer in Kansas City, before travelling extensively with medicine shows in Texas, and then touring the eastern seaboard. His feminine voice and outrageous manner, often as a female impersonator, established him as a crowd favorite. By 1917 he had begun working regularly in Atlantic City, New Jersey and in Chicago, often with such performers as Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters, whose staging he helped design. He served slightly less than a year in the United States Army in 1918-1919 and rose to the rank of sergeant. In the late 1920s he sang with top jazz bands when they passed through Chicago, working with Bennie Moten, King Oliver, Freddie Keppard and others. He performed and recorded with the pianists Cow Cow Davenport, Tampa Red and \\"Georgia Tom\\" Dorsey, recording with the latter pair under the name of The Black Hillbillies. He also recorded with the Harlem Hamfats. In the 1930s, he was often on radio in the Chicago area, and led his own band, titled Frankie \\"Half Pint\\" Jaxon and His Quarts of Joy. Jaxon appeared with Duke Ellington in a film short titled Black and Tan (1929), and with Bessie Smith in \\"St. Louis Blues\\" (1929). Cab Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" (1931) is based both musically and lyrically on Jaxon's \\"Willie the Weeper\\" (1927). In 1941 he retired from show business and worked at The Pentagon in Washington, D.C. He was transferred to Los Angeles. According to most sources, he died in the veterans hospital in 1944; Allmusic states he lived in Los Angeles until 1970. However, an application for a headstone as a military veteran, in the name of Frank Devera Jackson, has been suggested by writer Brian Berger as referring to him; it indicates that he died on May 15, 1953.

They are found in sub-Saharan tropical Africa and are sometimes known under common name African torrent frogs. They are inhabitants of the splash- water zone of clear-running streams predominantly in forests. Tadpoles are either semiterrestrial in the spray zone or fully aquatic in zones of the strongest currents. Some species guard their clutches. They are small (Ericabatrachus) or medium- to large-sized frogs (Arthroleptides and Petropedetes). Taxonomy The Petropedetidae are related to true frogs, family Ranidae, and have often been considered as a subfamily within a broadly defined Ranidae. However, they are now commonly treated as a family, although the genera included may differ between sources. In particular, Conraua is sometimes included in the Petropedetidae, instead of forming its own monogeneric family Conrauidae. Genera The three genera in the family are: * Arthroleptides Nieden, 1911 – African torrent frogs, three species * Ericabatrachus Largen, 1991 – Bale Mountains frogs, one species * Petropedetes Reichenow, 1874 – African water frogs, nine species Recognition of Arthroleptides as a genus separate from Petropedetes is relatively recent.

Common name Vissoke river frog has been coined for this species. Description Specimens in the type series measure in snout–vent length; the largest specimens are all females. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is very distinct. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are about one-third webbed; the tips of the digits are slightly dilated. Skin has many small but prominent spiny tubercles. The dorsum is uniform brown, except for chocolate- brown vertebral stripe present in about half of individuals. The lower parts vary from almost immaculate white to having few drown spots to dusky mottling or vermiculation. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus bequaerti lives in montane forests, grasslands, and wetlands at elevations of above sea level. Breeding presumably takes place in swamps. It seems to be common in suitable habitat, although populations appear to be declining, and only a single specimen was found from the Nyungwe Forest National Park during surveys in 2010–2011.

However, this nominal species is a species complex consisting of several species. Description Phrynobatrachus calcaratus is a small frog with a rounded snout and a moderately warty skin, growing to a snout-to-vent length of about for males and for females. The digits do not have enlarged tips and the fingers and toes are largely unwebbed. Most animals have a uniformly coloured greenish or brownish dorsal surface, slightly darker around the warts, and a whitish belly, but some have a spinal band of red with yellowish borders and a few have a red transverse band. The male has a prominent black vocal sac on the throat during the breeding season. Habitat This species is found in gallery forests in humid savannas, secondary forest along streams in the forest zone, and farm bush; it can also colonize savanna that has not burned. It is found mainly in lowland habitats, but elevations of in Cameroon. Reproduction The males call near suitable waterbodies and the females lay clutches of a few hundred eggs which hatch in three days. Tadpole growth is fast and the animals become mature at four to five months. They have a short lifespan and probably die within a few months of spawning.

It fell into ruin in the 18th century and remains in that state to this day. History View from the castle tower The construction of the fortress probably began in the late 13th century. It is certain that the castle existed in 1306, when king Władysław I the Elbow-high gave it to the Archbishop of Kraków, Jan Muskata. A year later, under the pretext of detection of a plot against the royal power, the castle returned to the king. It played a significant role as a place of concentration of troops departing for war with the Teutonic Knights. After the death of Władysław the Elbow-high the stronghold was enlarged by Casimir III the Great. At that time Chęciny become a residence of the king's second wife Adelaide of Hesse. In following years it was also a residence of Elisabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary, Sophia of Halshany and her son Władysław III of Varna and Bona Sforza. Later it was used for many years as a state prison. Among imprisoned here were Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg future Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Andrzej Wingold, Jogaila's half-brother and Warcisław of Gotartowice. In the second half of the 16th century, the castle began to decline. In 1588 the parliament ordered to transfer the castle's inventories to the Chęciny Church and in 1607, during the Zebrzydowski Rebellion the fortifications and buildings were partially destroyed and burned. The castle briefly regained its former glory due to reconstruction initiated by Stanisław Branicki, starost of Chęciny, but in 1655-1657 it was almost completely destroyed by Swedish-Brandenburgian and Transylvanian troops. The destruction was completed in 1707 during another Swedish occupation. Then, the last residents left the castle. Over the next century the medieval walls become a source of building material for local villagers.

Prior to its description in 2002, Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus was confused with species; the original species description mixed characteristics of both species. However, the two species can be distinguished morphologically and based on the male advertisement calls. In addition, they mostly occur in different habitats, despite having similar overall distribution: Phrynobatrachus guineensis is nearly always found in drier parts of the forest, whereas Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus clearly prefer swampy habitats. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. Many specimens have a vertebral line. The hips are yellow and the toe and finger tips are orange. The belly shows large black spots. Reproductive males have extremely swollen thumbs. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus guineensis occur in the drier parts of primary rainforest at elevations up to above sea level. They live arboreally, usually low in the trees. Breeding takes place in tree holes, but also in tiny waterbodies such as empty nuts and snail shells. The eggs are attached to the bark of the tree or similar position above the water.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, moist savanna, swampland, and intermittent freshwater marshes. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The guttural puddle frog is a small frog with a pointed snout and warty skin, growing to a snout-to-vent length of about for males and . The digits do not have enlarged tips and the fingers are unwebbed. The dorsal surface is greenish or brownish with dark blotches, sometimes bordered with black. The limbs are barred with green and the underparts are whitish. The male has a black vocal sac on the throat and the female has a black patch spotted with white on the throat. Distribution and habitat The guttural puddle frog is native to the eastern part of Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria and an isolated population is found in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its natural habitat is rain forest where it is usually found near ponds and other water bodies and during the rainy season it may be found in gallery forest and temporary savannah swamps.

Alcohol-preserved specimens are dorsally pale to dark grey-brown or yellow-brown. In life, adult males have bright yellow throat. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus minutus occurs at the swampy margins of aquatic habitats (lakes, rivers, streams, and temporary pools) in moist grassland and forest clearings at elevations of above sea level, but perhaps as low as . Breeding takes place in water. It is a quite common species where suitable habitat is present. Habitat degradation, caused in particular by agricultural expansion, human settlement, and overgrazing, is a threat to it. It is present in the Bale Mountains National Park, and probably in other protected areas as well.

Description Habitat, eggs and two colour variations of Phrynobatrachus natalensis, Ngoye Forest, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa The Natal dwarf puddle frog is a small frog with a rounded snout and warty skin, growing to a snout-to-vent length of about . The digits do not have enlarged tips and the fingers are unwebbed. It has a uniformly coloured greenish or brownish dorsal surface, slightly darker around the warts, and a whitish belly. The male has a prominent white-spotted, black vocal sac on the throat during the breeding season. Behaviour The Natal dwarf puddle frog feeds on a variety of invertebrates including beetles, termites, bugs, flies, cockroaches, grasshoppers, butterflies and spiders. Termites may be the most- frequently eaten food item. This frog breeds in the rainy season. At this time, males call and both sexes aggregate at ponds, streams, marshes, puddles, water accumulated in wheel ruts, pools and other wet locations. The eggs float and a clutch of several hundred form a raft on the surface and hatch about four days later. The tadpoles take about four to five weeks to develop to metamorphosis. Status The Natal dwarf puddle frog is listed by the IUCN as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it is an adaptable species with a very wide range and its numbers appear to be stable.

It is endemic to Pemba Island off Tanzania. It is similar to Phrynobatrachus acridoides, its sister species, but the two species differ in ecology and male advertisement call. On the other hand, the recently described, supposed diminutive species P. nigripes was simply based on juveniles and subadults of P. pakenhami. Etymology The specific name pakenhami honours Richard Hercules Wingfield Pakenham, a British colonial administrator who studied the fauna of Zanzibar and Pemba. Common name Pakenham's river frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length, although different authors report somewhat different ranges. The body is rather stocky. The snout is obtusely pointed. The tympanum is visible. The digital tips have discs, small on the fingers but well-developed on the toes. The toes are moderately webbed. Skin is smooth except for the W-shaped scapular warts. The dorsum is more or less uniform grey or brownish grey. The snout often bears a lighter triangle. A broad, light vertebral area, and a broad, transverse interorbital bar may be present. Darker brown patches are superimposed on the scapular warts. Hind limbs may have broad, light-edged dark crossbars. The upper lip is either uniform grey or barred. Venter is whitish with some minute, brown spots. Males have dark grey throat. Females are marked with brown blotches, which may give a dark cast to the throat. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus pakenhami occurs in forest and forest fringes of the northern part of the Pemba Island. Breeding takes place in pools, marshes, puddles and roadside ditches in and near tropical evergreen lowland forest. This species does not occur in severely disturbed habitats.

Coloration is polymorphic. One form is dorsally dark greyish brown, usually with black areas overlying the dermal ridges. The second color morph is otherwise similar but has a narrow yellow or orange vertebral stripe superimposed on the previous pattern. The third morph has a reddish brown dorsum, edged with a black line and grayish brown sides. Most individuals have a narrow oblique stripe on the rear of the thigh.

It is the intersection of a relevant product market and a relevant geographic market. The European Commission defines a relevant market and its product and geographic components as follows:https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:l26073 #A relevant product market comprises all those products and/or services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use; #A relevant geographic market comprises the area in which the firms concerned are involved in the supply of products or services and in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous. Definition and use The notion of relevant market is used in order to identify the products and undertakings which are directly competing in a business. Therefore, the relevant market is the market where the competition takes place. The enforcement of the provisions of competition law would be not possible without referring to the market where competition takes place. The extent to which firms are able to increase their prices above normal competition levels depends on the possibility for consumers to buy substitute goods and the ability for other firms to supply those products. The fewer the substitute products and/or the more difficult it is for other firms to begin to supply those products, the less elastic the demand curve is and the more probable is to find higher prices. For all these reasons it is necessary to define the relevant markets for the different cases which fall under the Law.Bishop and Walker (1999). The relevant market contains all those substitute products and regions which provide a significant competitive constraint on the products and regions of interest. An interesting guiding principle provided by Bishop and Darcey (1995) states that a relevant market is something worth monopolising, in the sense that the relevant market includes all the substitute products and therefore control of that market would allow the monopoliser to profitably increase the prices of the products to the monopoly level. This can only be possible if the products in this \\"market\\" are not subject to significant competitive constraints by products outside that market. In the United States, there exist a set of merger guidelines—written by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—which specify methods for analyzing and defining markets. Since 1980, the DOJ and the FTC have used these guidelines to convince courts to adopt a more explicitly economic approach to antitrust policy.See J. Gregory Sidak & David J. Teece, Rewriting the Horizontal Merger Guidelines in the Name of Dynamic Competition, 16 GEO. MASON L. REV. 885, 887 (2009); J. Gregory Sidak & David J. Teece, Dynamic Competition in Antitrust Law, 5 J. COMPETITION L. & ECON. 581, 584 (2009), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/dynamic-competition-in- antitrust-law.html. A relevant market comprises a product or group of products and the geographic area in which these products are produced and/or traded. Therefore, the relevant market has two components: the product market and the geographic market.Guidelines on relevant market definition with a view to determining the significant market share. Taken from www.globalcompetitionforum.org . Product market The relevant product market is determined according to three criteria: #Demand-side substitution. #Supply-side substitution. #Potential competition. Demand-side substitution Demand-side substitution takes place when consumers switch from one product to another in response to a change in the relative prices of the products. If consumers are in a position to switch to available substitute products or to begin sourcing their requirements from suppliers located in other areas, then it is unlikely that price increases will be profitable. Therefore, it is necessary to progressively include in the relevant market the products to which consumers would most likely switch in response to a relative price rise, repeating the exercise at each stage until a collection of products is reached that is worth monopolising. When examining the likely responses of consumers, it is the response of the marginal consumer, not the average consumer which is important. Therefore, a small but significant number of consumers (generally 5 to 10 percent) switching to another product when there is a price increase is considered a sufficient condition for both goods to be defined as forming part of the same relevant market. Therefore, the existence of a group of consumers who would never switch in response to a relative price increase is not by itself sufficient to conclude that the relevant market should be defined narrowly. Determining both the likely extent of demand-side substitution, and the level of substitution which would imply that monopolisation was not worthwhile, requires an assessment of the price- elasticity of demand. This is generally done using the SSNIP-test. However, in digital markets, where consumers are often offered services for free, the SSNIP test cannot be performed, being the price equal to zero. For this reason, different techniques (including machine learning) are employed to define the relevant market. Supply-side substitution Sometimes consumers may be unable to react to a price increase, nevertheless, producers may be able to do so by for example, increasing their supply to satisfy the demand of these consumers. If other producers respond to an increase in the relative price of the products supplied by the single supplier by switching production facilities to producing the monopolized collection of products, the increased level of supply may render any attempted price increase unprofitable. In this case, those producers with the ability for supply-side substitution should be included in the relevant market. Geographic market The geographic market is an area in which the conditions of competition applying to the product concerned are the same for all traders.Bellamy and Child (1993). The same factors used in delineating relevant product markets should be used to define the relevant geographic market. The elements to be taken into consideration when defining the relevant geographic market include the nature and characteristics of the concerned products, the existence of entry barriers, consumer preferences, differences among the market shares of undertakings in the neighboring geographic areas, as well as significant differences between suppliers’ prices and transport costs level. An interesting aspect to which competition authorities look at are transport costs, given that high transport costs may explain why trade between two regions is economically infeasible.

Resolved the HBO documentary; IMPACT Coalition is one of the film's resources. History In the early 1980s many urban schools faced budget cuts and debate teams were one of the first casualties. The IMPACT Coalition has helped New York and other big cities to experience a comeback for debate. Resolved: That High School Debate is Back; Discusses an IMPACT Coalition Member School . IMPACT was founded in 1991 by Will Baker as IMPACT Foundation. The first concept was to use intercollegiate debate teams as mentoring programs. This model was based on the research of Pamela Kallbfliesch and Angela Davies on mentoring to counteract poverty and discrimination. IMPACT became an affiliate of the Phelps Stokes Fund with Andrew Rainwater Jacobs as IMPACT’s first program director. In 1991, IMPACT created a consortium of urban college debate programs at Columbia University, Rockland Community College and Queens College called the NY Coalition of Colleges to match the resources of larger traditional programs. NYU Debate; Discusses the team's history and IMPACT's involvement. The first sponsored event was the Urban Workshop Series at the Church Center for the UN. From this series, new college debate teams were developed at Baruch College, Fordham University, Columbia University, the New School and NYU. These teams partnered with corporate volunteers, alumni, experienced debaters, and coaches enabling each school to sustain its own debate program and present them on a wider stage. IMPACT changed its name from “Foundation” to “Coalition” to reflect the multiple partnerships that comprised its operations. In 1994, IMPACT expanded its efforts to reach students who could not travel to weekend tournaments forming the Public Forum Debate League (PFDL). Baker recruited Yeshiva University and extended debate to faith-based populations previously precluded from debating competitively by their observances. In 1997, the Open Society Institute (OSI) with Beth Breger, decided to replicate the existing Atlanta urban debate model. The first urban debate league replication was piloted in New York City in 1997. Thus, the New York Urban Debate League (NYUDL) was created in partnership with Emory University and with Baker consulting on behalf of IMPACT. The NYUDL launched the current era of urban debate expansion. Students from inner cities find power at the podium; article in the Christian Science Monitor. Programs On average, The IMPACT Coalition provides the debate league's member schools with $10,000 a year each for competition expenses, including travel, lodging and registration fees.

It is found in Sierra Leone, southern Guinea, Liberia, and Ivory Coast. Prior to its description in 2002, it was confused with Phrynobatrachus guineensis, one of its closest relatives. The specific name phyllophilus is derived from the Greek phyllon for leaves and philein for loving. It refers to on the close association of this species with leaf litter. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is moderately pointed. The tympanum is small but distinct. The digits are enlarged to discs. The fingers are unwebbed but the toes are moderately webbed. Roughness of the skin changes within individuals; skin is normally smooth in reproductive males. The dorsal colouration ranges from beige to dark brown. There are black lateral bands. Flanks have sometimes clear spots on flanks, ranging from white, yellow, yellow with a red central part, or red with a fine orange border in colour. There might be a broad orange to red transverse band may cross the back. There is one (occasionally two even three) dark transverse bar on femur and tibia. The belly is white. Throat is black in reproductive males but can be almost white with few blacks spots in non-reproductive males. Females have white to gray throats with irregular dark spots and patches. The male advertisement call is a series of different brief \\"clicks\\" with a metallic quality. The tadpoles are uniformly brown with hyaline fin carrying few small dots. The largest tadpoles (ready to metamorphose) measure in total length, including a 5 mm body. Metamorphosed froglets measure about in snout–vent length. Habitat and ecology Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus occur in swampy parts of primary rainforest at elevations up to above sea level, possibly higher. They live in leaf litter. The eggs are deposited terrestrially close to water, the only Phrynobatrachus known to do so. The tadpoles develop in extremely small puddles. The diet consists mostly of insects, particularly coleopterans. Conservation Phrynobatrachus phyllophilus is a very common species. It is negatively impacted by habitat loss caused by agricultural development, logging, and expanding human settlements. It might also be locally threatened by mining activities.

It opened in 1856 as a textile warehouse for the wholesale drapery business of S & J Watts, and was the largest single-occupancy textile warehouse in Manchester. Today the building is part of the Britannia Hotels chain. History The Watts family The textile firm, S & J Watts was founded by James Watts (Mayor of Manchester), a Mancunian industrialist and entrepreneur, whose textile business had started in a small weaver's cottage in Didsbury. His success as a cotton trader was part of the commercial boom of the 19th century that gave Manchester the name \\"Cottonopolis\\", when the city was a global centre for the cotton trade. Watts became an important figure among British industrialists, socialising with politicians and churchmen at his home, Abney Hall, in Cheadle. Prince Albert chose to stay with him when he visited Manchester to open the Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857.Manchester Online – The Britannia Hotel Construction The stairwell The sandstone ashlar warehouse was built by local architects Travis & Mangnall in 1851–56 at a cost of £100,000. Its ornate style typifies the extravagant confidence of many Mancunian warehouses of this period, but the Watts Warehouse is notable for its peculiarly eclectic design. Designed in the form of a Venetian palazzo, the building has five storeys, each decorated in a different style – Italian Renaissance, Elizabethan, French Renaissance and Flemish – and roof pavilions featuring large Gothic wheel windows.\\".. a licentious bit of confectionery in stone, iron, timber and glass\\" according to the compilers of Manchester (City Buildings Series); ed. by Dennis Sharp; Studio Vista, London, 1969 The interior was similarly lavish in its decoration, with a sweeping iron cantilever staircase, balconied stairwell, and mahogany counters for displaying merchandise. War memorial \\"The Sentry\\" war memorial by C. S. Jagger During the First World War 1914–18, many employees of S & J Watts lost their lives in battle. The company marked this by erecting a memorial in 1922 in the main entrance to the building on Portland Street. A bronze sculpture, \\"the Sentry\\", stands in an arched niche on the right, and on the opposite side is a marble plaque commemorating the dead. The bronze statue depicts the sentry wearing a Tommy helmet, World War I battle gear and a cape, standing on guard with his rifle with fixed bayonet upright, and was commissioned from the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger who also designed the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner, London. A statuette version of the figure is to be seen in the study of Eltham Palace, where it was displayed by Stephen Courtauld, who was – like Jagger – a member of the Artists' Rifles during the First World War. The Blitz During the Second World War, the Watts Warehouse was hit by Luftwaffe bombs, but it was saved from destruction when the fire was smothered by textiles.Industrial Powerhouse audio trails Conversion to a hotel The textile industries that built Manchester eventually dwindled and, like many other industrial structures in the North of England, Watts Warehouse fell into disuse and was derelict for many years. The building was threatened with demolition in 1972, but was spared. In the 1980s, the building underwent conversion, retaining many of the original interior features. In May 1982, the Britannia Hotel opened as part of the Britannia Hotels chain initially with 25 rooms and a nightclub, eventually expanding to 363 bedrooms.Hotel History The building was Grade II* listed in 1952.

It is found in western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. The specific name steindachneri honours Franz Steindachner, an Austrian herpetologist and ichthyologist. This species is also known as Steindachner's puddle frog and Steindachner's river frog. Taxonomy and systematics Phrynobatrachus steindachneri forms, together with Phrynobatrachus jimzimkusi and Phrynobatrachus njiomock described in 2013, so-called \\"Phrynobatrachus steindachneri complex\\". Even after identifying the latter lineages as distinct species, Phrynobatrachus steindachneri shows large genetic differences and could contain more than one species. Description Phrynobatrachus steindachneri measure in snout–vent length. The body is compact with very strong limbs. The head is longer than it is broad. The canthus rostralis is sharp. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers and the toes are slim with small but distinct discs. The toes are extensively webbed. Skin is smooth or may have very small asperities. The dorsum is grey-green or olive-brown; some individuals appear veined or mottled. The hindlimbs have dark crossbars. The ventrum is white with brown or blackish mottling. The limbs are ventrally yellowish. Males have a subgular vocal sac. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus steindachneri occurs in montane forests, forest strips, and montane grassland at elevations of above sea level. It is associated with slow-flowing watercourses and can occur in very open (disturbed) situations. Breed takes place in still water and marshes. This species was previously (until about 2009) one of the most common species found in the mountains, but has strongly declined in later years. Although the reasons of this decline are not known, it is similar to declines associated with chytridiomycosis. Other threats include ongoing loss of forest and the degradation of montane grassland caused by to agricultural expansion, wood extraction, and expanding human settlements.

It is endemic to Ivory Coast and only known from its type locality, Taï Forest in the Taï National Park. There are concerns about taxonomic validity of this species. Common name Tai river frog has been coined for it. Description The holotype, an adult male, measures in snout–vent length; females are unknown but presumably larger. The tympanum is indistinct. The eyelid has a prominent tubercle. The finger and toe tips are barely widened and have no discs. The fingers are unwebbed and the toes have only rudimentary webbing. The dorsum is warty and has a pair of oval scapular glands. Dorsal colouration is brown with (male holotype) or without marbling (juvenile paratype).

The candidates, Luo Lei, Xu Xiaofei, and Cheng Cheng, compete against each other for the coveted role and are egged on by their teachers and doting parents. This was reported to be an interesting use of classic democratic voting principles and interpersonal dynamics.cf. Catalani review of the film in The Asian Reporter The documentary gives a glimpse into China's contemporary urban middle classes. It won the Sterling Feature Award at Silverdocs in 2007. In November 2007, Please Vote for Me was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The list was narrowed to five films on January 22, 2008, but Please Vote for Me did not make it to the final five. The film is part of the \\"Why Democracy?\\" series. It was aired in no less than 35 different countries around the world in October 2007, including BBC in the UK and PBS (as part of Independent Lens) in the United States. Plot An experiment in democracy is taking place in Wuhan, China. For the first time ever, the students in grade three at Evergreen Primary School in Wuhan, China have been asked to elect a class monitor. Traditionally appointed by the teacher, the class monitor holds a powerful position, helping to control the students, keeping them on task and doling out punishment to those who disobey. The teacher has chosen three candidates: Luo Lei (a boy), the current class monitor; Cheng Cheng (a boy); and Xu Xiaofei (a girl). Each candidate is asked to choose two assistants to help with his or her campaign. To prove their worthiness, the candidates must perform in three events. First is a talent show, where each candidate plays an instrument or sings a song. Second is a debate, in which the candidates bring up the shortcomings of their opponents as well as their own personal qualifications. And finally, each candidate must deliver a speech, an opportunity to appeal directly to classmates and ask for their votes. At home, each of the children is coached by his or her parents and pushed to practice and memorize for each stage of the campaign. Although their parents are supportive, the candidates feel the pressure. Tears and the occasional angry outburst reveal the emotional impact. At school, the candidates talk to classmates one-on-one, making promises, planning tactics (including negative ones) and at times expressing doubts about their own candidacies. For all three children, the campaign takes its toll, especially for the losing candidates and their assistants. Viewers are left to decide if the experiment in democracy has been “successful” and what it might mean for democracy education in China. PLEASE VOTE FOR ME challenges those committed to China’s democratization to consider the feasibility of, and processes involved in its implementation.

It is endemic to eastern Tanzania and is known from the Udzungwa, Uluguru, Nguu, and Nguru Mountains. Common names Ukinga puddle frog and Udzungwa puddle frog have been coined for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is stocky. The snout is slightly pointed. The tympanum is inconspicuous. The toes are broadly webbed. The finger and toe tips are expanded and have circummarginal grooves. The dorsum has rich, reddish brown colouration. A large, red or orange transverse zone between the arm insertions across the shoulders may be present; it is bordered by a darker brown or blackish transverse band. Additional patterning may include a dark interorbital band or inverted triangle, and chevrons or dark transverse bands at the level of the axillae. A pale area in front of the interorbital band and a pale spot between the shoulders are often evident. The limbs have crossbars, except for the upper arms. The upper arms are orange and the tips of the digits are bright red. The lower jaw is blackish. Males have an unpigmented vocal sac and more white spines on the gular skin. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus uzungwensis lives in submontane and montane forests at elevations generally higher than above sea level. It is associated with mountain streams, its probable breeding habitat. The types were found in vegetation just above the ground, on rocks, and in a small pool of water close to a stream; the last micro-habitat included an amplexant pair. While Phrynobatrachus uzungwensis is locally abundant within suitable habitat, it is negatively affected by the loss of its forest habitat resulting from agriculture, logging, fire, and human settlements. It has been recorded in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and in the Uluguru North, Nguru South, and Kanga Forest Reserves.

Constructed in 1874, the Ausenbaugh–McElhenny House was originally home to one of the first men of Wayne Township, Joseph J. McElhenny, whose local prominence was demonstrated by his election to the office of justice of the peace. The house is one of the area's premier examples of 1870s architecture, due primarily to its Gothic Revival elements both on the exterior and the interior.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1024-1025. It has been designated a historic site. Built of weatherboarded walls set on a stone foundation, the Ausenbaugh–McElhenny House is covered with an asphalt roof and features smaller elements of stone and wood. Decorative elements of the stonework include rusticated blocks on the exterior courses of the foundation, as well as the use of large stone blocks for the stairs from the ground to the entry porch, a large wooden structure. The overall plan resembles the letter \\"T\\" with some changes; including a one-story extension at the letter's base, as well as the presence of the shed-roofed porch in the side ell. Aside from the single-story extension, the house is a two-story building with walls that rise to gables. Both rounded and rectangular windows pierce the walls, while the porch-facing main entrance assumes the latter shape. Detailed Gothic-styled woodwork is placed at the peak of the gables, while a small chimney sits at the peak of the roof near the right end of the crosspiece of the \\"T\\"., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.

Appointed by President Richard Nixon on September 20, 1971,Richard Nixon: Statement Announcing Nomination of Romana A. Banuelos as Treasurer of the United States, The American Presidency Project, University of California, Santa Barbara, 2007. Accessed 2007-07-23. she served from December 17, 1971 to February 14, 1974. Born into a poor family of Mexican-Americans, Acosta became the first Hispanic treasurer of the United States (1971–1974) and owner of a multimillion-dollar business, Ramona's Mexican Food Products, Inc. headquartered in Gardena, California. She also co-founded the Pan American National Bank in East Los Angeles. Early life Acosta, daughter of poor Mexican immigrants, was born in the mining town of Miami, Arizona, on March 20, 1925, to Juan Francisco Acosta and Teresa Lugo. In 1933, during the Great Depression, the U.S. government deported her family, and thousands of other Mexican-Americans, even though many of the deportees, like Acosta, had been born in the United States (and were thus, according to the 14th Amendment, U.S. citizens not legally subject to deportation). The Acostas believed the deportation officials' statement that they could return as soon as the country's economy had improved, so they accepted the government's offer to pay for their moving expenses and left their home peacefully. They moved in with relatives who owned a small ranch in the Mexican state of Sonora. Along with her parents, Acosta began rising early to tend the crops that her father and other male relatives had planted. She helped her mother in the kitchen as well, making empanadas that her mother sold to bakeries and restaurants to make extra money. Acosta later recalled that her mother, who also raised chickens for their eggs, \\"was the type of woman who taught us how to live in any place and work with what we have.\\" She called her mother a resourceful businesswoman who presented a strong role model for what a woman could do economically with very little. Acosta married in Mexico at age 16, not an unusually young age in that culture at the time. She had two sons, Carlos and Martin, by age 18, but her husband deserted the family in 1943. She returned to the United States with her children. Some reports speculate she worked in an El Paso, Texas, laundromat for a time, while others say she followed an aunt to Los Angeles. Most accounts describe Acosta arriving in Los Angeles, California with her children, unable to speak English and with only seven dollars to her name. Career Ramona's Mexican Food Products Quickly finding employment as a dishwasher during the day and as a tortilla maker from midnight to 6 a.m., Acosta soon began making enough money to save a little. At 21, she married a man named Alejandro and saved about $500, which she used to start her own tortilla factory in downtown Los Angeles. Acosta bought a tortilla machine, a fan, and a corn grinder, and with her aunt helping her she made $36 on the factory's first day of business in 1949. Ambitious, young, and driven, Acosta looked constantly for opportunities to sell her tortillas to local businesses. As sales volumes increased, she incorporated the company and named it Ramona's Mexican Food Products, Inc. There is some discrepancy as to how the business' name came about: some say the sign painters made a mistake when spelling \\"Romana\\"; others insist \\"Ramona\\" was an early California folk hero; and still others believe it was a product of people's unfamiliarity with the name \\"Romana.\\" Regardless, by the mid-1960s, Ramona's Mexican Food Products, Inc. was thriving and Acosta had a daughter, whom she named Ramona after the business. Pan-American National Bank In 1963, looking for ways to help the struggling Latinos in her neighborhood, Acosta and some businessmen founded the Pan-American National Bank in East Los Angeles, California. The men had initially approached Alejandro with the proposal, but he was busy with political work and suggested the men talk to Acosta. The bank's main purpose was to bankroll Latinos who wanted to start their own businesses. Acosta also believed that if Hispanics could increase their financial base they would have more political influence and be able to improve their standard of living. In 1969 Acosta was appointed chairperson of the bank's board of directors and received the city's Outstanding Business Woman of the Year Award. Later that year, Mayor Sam Yorty presented her with a commendation from the County Board of Supervisors, and Acosta established a college scholarship fund, the Ramona Mexican Food Products Scholarship, for poor Mexican-American students. United States Treasurer With bank assets already in the millions and deposits climbing rapidly, Pan-American National's huge success caught the attention of the Richard Nixon's administration. The president was seeking to repay the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, which had played a strong role in his election. Acosta agreed to throw her name into the hat when asked in 1970 if she would consider the post of U.S. treasurer. Not believing she had a chance to be nominated and confirmed, Acosta went about her daily life. She was stunned when Nixon personally chose her as his candidate. During the nomination process, Acosta was even more taken aback by a sudden raid on her tortilla factory by U.S. Immigration Service agents. The agents, contrary to their usual methods, reportedly carried out a loud, disruptive raid through the facility, attracting a lot of press attention and apparently hurting Acosta's chances of securing the treasurer nomination. However, Nixon sided with her and called the raid politically motivated, charging the Democratic Party with instigating it. She was later vindicated when a Senate investigation ruled that the raid was carried out solely to cause embarrassment to the Nixon administration. Despite the ugly affair, Acosta sailed through the confirmation process to become the nation's 34th treasurer and the first Latina in the position in U.S. history. She took office on December 17, 1971, becoming the highest-ranking Mexican- American in the government. Her daughter would say of Acosta's performance as treasurer, \\"My mother's legacy is that she ran the place as a business, not just as another wing of the government.\\" Acosta Bañuelos served as treasurer until 1974, by which time Nixon was under tremendous pressure due to the Watergate affair and was soon to resign as president, replaced by Gerald Ford. She resigned as treasurer earlier in the year to spend more time with her businesses, family, and philanthropic pursuits. She said during a 1979 interview with Nuestro magazine, \\"It was a beautiful experience. I will always be grateful to President Nixon.\\" Later that year, Acosta was a founding member of Executive Women in Government. By 1979, Ramona's was making and distributing 22 different food products. It had more than 400 employees and sales of $12 million a year. The company's success was instrumental in the popularization of Mexican cuisine in the United States. As the Hispanic population of the country grew, of course, so did sales of tortillas, empanadas, and many other traditional favorites. However, other ethnic groups began to favor the inexpensive, delicious foods as well, boosting the company's profits. Ramona's continued to grow throughout the 1980s, when it became one of the largest distributors and manufacturers of Mexican food in California. Later life Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Acosta continued to serve as president of Ramona's and Pan-American National, and by 1992, she had served three terms as chair of the bank's board of directors. However, in the late 1990s, she allowed her three children to take over daily operations of Ramona's and to play large roles in the bank's operations. Acosta Bañuelos remained CEO at Pan-American National and president of Ramona's, running both businesses from her Los Angeles home. The Acosta family owned two-thirds of the shares in the publicly traded bank. Pan-American National Bank is credited with helping economically troubled East Los Angeles develop a sense of community and with being a vital factor in the economic improvement of its Latino population. Acosta Bañuelos died January 15, 2018 in Redondo Beach, California.

A road maintenance depot is a depot used by road maintenance agencies for storing works equipment and organising maintenance operations. Road maintenance depots can range in size from small sheds storing just a few pieces of equipment, to vast buildings housing computer and closed-circuit television systems, allowing operators to monitor conditions across the road network. Road maintenance depots carry gear for a number of tasks, including road works, snow removal, planting of road verge and central reservations and storm drain maintenance. Most depots will have limited accommodation facilities for staff who are on-call, particularly during heavy winter storms, when travel between the worker's home and the depot may be restricted. Road maintenance depots also include garages and repair shops for the fleets of vehicles stored within, and large depots keep supplies of fuel and road salt for drivers. Operations A salt barn at a depot near Lake Michigan, United States. Depots carry a wide range of vehicles to cover most eventualities, depending on the location of the depot; small urban depots carry street sweeper vehicles and small gully emptiers, while larger rural and motorway-based depots hold fleets of winter service vehicles and engineering vehicles, and often tow trucks and breakdown vehicles for rescuing broken down or stranded equipment. Other vehicles commonly kept at depots include lawnmowers, sprayers and road markers. Along with garages, most depots also have either salt barns or brine tanks, to store de-icing agents for use in winter months, and filling stations to refuel vehicles, especially those that use red diesel, which is not available at public filling stations. Larger depots have vehicle washes and repair shops to maintain the fleet, and a cafeteria and on-call room for workers. International Germany Autobahnmeisterei Tauberbischofsheim in Germany Road maintenance depots in Germany are known as Straßenmeisterei or Autobahnmeisterei. Responsibility for operating the depot depends on the type of road covered by the catchment area of the depot; those that cover the autobahn network and major road are owned by the Federal Government, while those that cover more urban roads are operated by the local city administration.

The status of Phrynobatrachus manengoubensis from Mount Manengouba remains unclear, with some questioning its distinctness from Phrynobatrachus werneri. Common name Werner's river frog has been coined for this species. Etymology The specific name werneri honours Franz Werner, an Austrian explorer, zoologist, and herpetologist. Description Phrynobatrachus werneri is a small species measuring in snout–vent length; Blackburn and Rödel (2011) give range for adult males. The tympanum is distinct. The tips of the digits are widened or expanded into small discs. The toes have no or only rudimentary webbing. The tympanic region is dark and shows a supratypanic ridge. Females are pale ventrally. Males have a black throat and some darker pigmentation on the chest and anterior of the belly. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus werneri is found in and around small bodies of water such as streams, roadside ditches, Raphia swamps and marshes in submontane and montane forest and grassland landscapes. It tolerates habitat alteration. Breeding takes place in still water, including marshes. It is a common and adaptable species that is not at serious risk from habitat change.

It has been recorded in the Kogelberg, Hottentots-Holland, and Klein River mountains at the elevations of asl. Even though its range is very restricted and in four separate locations, it is relatively common where it occurs. It is possible that the separate populations represent cryptic species, but this has not yet been studied. Poyntonia paludicola inhabit montane fynbos (Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation) in areas with high rainfall (2,000-3,000 mm per year). These frogs breed in shallow streams and seepages. The populations are believed to be stable but the populations are potentially threatened by habitat change caused by alien species, dam construction, and fires. All known populations are in protected areas, Kogelberg Biosphere Nature Reserve, Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve, and Fernkloof Nature Reserve. Poyntonia paludicola are small frogs, measuring in snout–vent length. They strongly resemble bufonids with their rough and warty skin on sides and dorsal surfaces of adults.

It can be an isolated finding in an otherwise normal individual, or it can be related to a congenital disorder, genetic syndrome or birth defect. Dysmorphology is the study of dysmorphic features, their origins and proper nomenclature. One of the key challenges in identifying and describing dysmorphic features is the use and understanding of specific terms between different individuals. Clinical geneticists and pediatricians are usually those most closely involved with the identification and description of dysmorphic features, as most are apparent during childhood. Dysmorphic features can vary from isolated, mild anomalies such as clinodactyly or synophrys to severe congenital anomalies, such as heart defects and holoprosencephaly. In some cases, dysmorphic features are part of a larger clinical picture, sometimes known as a sequence, syndrome or association. Recognizing the patterns of dysmorphic features is an important part of a geneticist's diagnostic process, as many genetic disease present with a common collection of features. There are several commercially available databases that allow clinicians to input their observed features in a patient to generate a differential diagnosis. These databases are not infallible, as they require on the clinician to provide their own experience, particularly when the observed clinical features are general. A male child with short stature and hypertelorism could have several different disorders, as these findings are not highly specific. However a finding such as 2,3-toe syndactyly raises the index of suspicion for Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Dysmorphic features are invariably present from birth, although some are not immediately apparent upon visual inspection. They can be divided into groups based on their origin, including malformations (abnormal development), disruptions (damage to previously normal tissue), deformations (damage caused by an outside physical force) and dysplasias (abnormal growth or organization within a tissue).

He is an expert in the field of mechanical harvesting of fruit, and is the holder of several patents for mechanical apparatus for the harvesting and processing of jojoba beans, pecan nuts and pomegranates. Dr. Yoav Sarig Biography Early years and academic education Sarig was born in Tel-Aviv.Yoav Sarig - Volcani Center He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the Technion in 1962 and his master's degree from the Technion in 1972. Sarig was awarded his doctorate from Michigan State University in 1976.COMMENCEMENT 1976 MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY The title of his doctoral thesis was Deformation analysis of foam-encapsulated apples under impact loading. Research interests Working for Israel's Volcani Centre, where he headed the Institute for Agricultural Engineering from 1985 to 1988, Sarig developed apparatus including a mechanical pollinator for Date Palms,Development of a ground-operated mechanical pollinator for date palms an apparatus for separating pomegranate seeds,Apparatus for separating pomegranate seeds a mechanical cracker for Macadamia nuts and a machine for harvesting agricultural produce from the ground suitable for Pecan nuts and similar produce.Machine for harvesting agricultural produce In later years, his interest turned to non-invasive methods for evaluation of agricultural produce - to assess a product's readiness for harvest or its ripeness without harming the fruit. He pioneered the use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to evaluate the maturity of Avocado fruits, and the use of an \\"artificial nose\\" utilizing the olfactory response of fresh produce as a consumer-oriented and non-destructive quality evaluation method.Artificial Olfactory Sensing for Quality Evaluation of Fresh Produce He also researched the use of mechanization and automation as an alternative to manual labor in agriculture, and published several articles on the topic, which concluded that as long as cheap immigrant labor (some of it illegal) was available, there is little incentive for farmers to invest in labor-saving agricultural automation. China When China in 1992 formally established diplomatic relations with Israel and an Israeli embassy was opened in Beijing, Sarig was appointed Science and Agriculture Counsellor, a role he held for 4 years, from 1993 to 1997. There, Sarig proposed and oversaw the establishment of three major demonstration farms in China, which showcase Israeli agricultural technology, and several training centers which are supported by both the Chinese and Israeli ministries of agriculture. Sarig also realized the significance of conducting a variety of management courses in China, and instituted a program to deliver courses in business, marketing and business management.How Do You Say Business in Mandarin In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the title \\"Honorary Professor\\" by China Agricultural University.

It was written, produced and directed by Jack Webb, who also starred as Joe Friday. It is sometimes called \\"Blue Boy\\" after a character appearing on it. This was the first color episode broadcast of Dragnet and the first episode of the later series broadcast.  Plot  ;Opening narration \\"This is the city — Los Angeles, California. It's a fine place to enjoy life. There are places reserved just for kids... when they're young and feel young. Places they go when they're young and feel old... beginning the big search for something that often doesn't exist in the places they look for it. They might find it here [image of a church] or here [image of a synagogue] or maybe here [image of another church]. They could try looking here [image of Griffith Observatory]... their search might end with a college degree. One thing sure — whatever they're looking for — it cannot be found inside a number five capsule. When they try, that's where I come in. I carry a badge.\\" \\"It was Tuesday, March fifteenth [1966]. It was fair in Los Angeles. We were working the day watch out of Juvenile Narcotics. My partner's Bill Gannon, the boss is Captain Richey. My name is Friday. A powerful new drug capable of producing weird and dangerous hallucinations had found its way onto the streets of the city. It had fallen into the hands of juvenile experimenters. We had to try and stop it.\\" ;Synopsis A call comes into the Los Angeles Police Department juvenile narcotics division with a complaint of a person painted like an Indian and chewing the bark off a tree. When detectives Joe Friday and Bill Gannon arrive at MacArthur Park, they find a boy with his head buried in the ground. The suspect is acting erratically and has half of his face painted blue and the other half yellow and identifies himself only as Blue Boy. A tussle ensues after the boy is read his Miranda rights and placed under arrest. A doctor determines the boy is under the influence of an unknown drug and he's taken to the narcotics unit of juvenile division where he's questioned. The boy is found with several sugar cubes and states there's no law against the drugs he has taken. He continues to act erratically, so Captain Richey tells the detectives to bring the sugar cubes to the crime lab for analysis. At the scientific investigation division, forensic chemist Ray Murray states that the drug is lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate, commonly known as LSD-25, that it was developed by a Swiss biochemist named Albert Hofmann, and it causes hallucinations, severe nausea along with aches and pains as well as anxiety and depression. Sergeant Friday states there are no laws to cover the use or sale of LSD. Back at juvenile division, the boy is identified as Benjamin \\"Benjie\\" Carver. Benjie's parents are briefed about the situation, but they don't feel there's cause for concern and they don't want their son arrested. The father states that LSD is not illegal and Friday informs him that it's against the law to be in an intoxicated state under the influence of any drug. The father threatens to get his attorney involved and wants to take the boy home, so Captain Richey tells the detectives to book Benjie under the generic law; In danger of leading an idle, dissolute or immoral life, section 601 of the welfare and institutions code. The case was heard in court several weeks later where Benjie is placed on probation and released to his parents. Two days later, Friday and Gannon join Sergeants Zappey and Carr in questioning two juveniles, Sandra Quillen and Edna Mae Dixon, who are high on LSD. The girls mention that they got the drugs from Blue Boy and then get sick. Sergeant Zappey relates that a bus on Sunset Strip will drive people up to Hollywood Hills to take the Acid Test for a dollar. Over the next six months, acid becomes more popular. The captain informs the detectives that new state and federal laws have been passed, listing LSD as a dangerous drug. [This had, in fact, occurred on October 6, 1966.] A youth, Teddy Carstairs, is brought in for possession of LSD. He says he got the drugs from Blue Boy and is willing to testify to it. Friday and Gannon visit the Carver's home to pick up Benjie only to discover he moved out three months earlier. Benjie's mother apologizes to Friday for her earlier failure to cooperate with him. Two months later and the detectives find Sandra and Edna Mae on Sunset Strip and find out that Blue Boy is having an acid party. They get the address and find several people high on acid including a painter eating paint off a paintbrush who tells them Benjie left. Friday calls in for officers to arrest the partygoers and finds out a drugstore has recently sold 3,000 empty pill capsules. At the drug store, the pharmacist, Ben Riddle, identifies Benjie as purchasing the empty capsules and gives them his address. Friday and Gannon arrive at an apartment building and get a key to Benjie's apartment from the manager. Inside they find Benjie's friend, Phillip Jameson, and many drugs. Benjie is on the other side of the room motionless, having been that way for about an hour, and after telling Phillip he wanted to \\"get further out\\". Friday checks his pulse and declares, \\"Well, he made it. He's dead\\". ;Closing narration \\"The story you have just seen is true. The names were changed to protect the innocent. On December 15, a Coroner's inquest was held at the County Morgue, Hall of Justice, City and County of Los Angeles. In a moment, the results of that inquest.\\" \\"At the inquest, the coroner's jury ruled that the 18-year-old suspect had administered himself an overdose of lysergic acid diethylamide in combination with various barbiturates and had thus taken his own life.\\" Text: \\"BENJAMIN JOHN CARVER - - Deceased.\\"  Reception  The Old-Time Dragnet Show with Adam Graham, writing in 2010, claims that this particular episode was voted #85 for \\"greatest TV episodes of all time\\" by TV Guide and Nick at Nite’s TV Land. Describing the social context, he says: > \\"The show does a great job showing how those who are charged with enforcing > the law are often frustrated by the law. It was also cutting edge in dealing > with the issue of LSD in 1967 ... For some, this represented a hard hit back > against the emerging counterculture ... Friday re-emerged as the rock solid > hero we needed in a time when everything was shifting.\\" Scott Beale at Laughing Squid comments wryly, \\"It’s a bit ironic that the LSD episode is the first episode of Dragnet in color.\\"  Themes  *While the episode centers on the dangers of LSD, the climax shows that Benjie died not of an LSD overdose (which is nearly physically impossible), but rather a barbiturate overdose, which another character says was brought on by Benjie's desire to get \\"farther out.\\" *The plot in this episode was inspired by a real life acid test in Watts. That event was chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. The band was the newly formed Grateful Dead.

It was released in 1982 and produced by Christopher Neil. The album includes the singles \\"I Wouldn't Beg for Water\\" (US number 64) and \\"Machinery\\" (US number 57, UK number 38), as well as the UK single \\"Are You Man Enough\\". The album featured an early recording of the song \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\", which would later be famously covered by Bette Midler and others. It also included the first recording of \\"You Do It\\", subsequently recorded by Diana Ross and Rita Coolidge, and a cover of Janis Ian's classic \\"In The Winter\\". The album was one of Easton's lower-charting efforts, reaching number 85 in the United States number 44 in the UK, but was more successful in Scandinavia and went Gold in Canada. Easton promoted the album by way of an hour-long special Act One, produced for American television and syndicated worldwide, during which she performed a number of songs from the album and embarked on her first world tour. A CD reissue in 2000 added the bonus tracks and B-sides from One Way Records. On February 23, 2013, Edsel Records (UK) reissued Easton's \\"You Could Have Been with Me\\" & \\"Madness, Money and Music\\" in two compact disc packages remastered with bonus tracks. On November 24, 2014 the album was included in an Original Album Series box set in the UK with all of Easton's first five albums with EMI through Warner Music Group.

It is a fairly common isolated anomaly which often goes unnoticed, but also occurs in combination with other abnormalities in certain genetic syndromes. The term is from the Ancient Greek κλίνειν ' meaning \\"to bend\\" and δάκτυλος ' meaning \\"digit\\". Genetics Clinodactyly is an autosomal dominant trait that has variable expressiveness and incomplete penetrance. Clinodactyly can be passed through inheritance and presents as either an isolated anomaly or a component manifestation of a genetic syndrome. Many syndromes are associated with clinodactyly, including those listed below, , but the phenotype, by itself, is not a sensitive or specific diagnostic test for these syndromes (it is present in up to 18% of the normal population ). * Down syndrome * Turner syndrome * Aarskog syndrome * Carpenter syndrome * Seckel syndrome * Cornelia de Lange syndrome * Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 * 13q deletion syndrome * XXYY syndrome * Silver–Russell syndrome * Andersen-Tawil syndrome * Noonan syndrome * Ehlers–Danlos syndrome When identified prenatally, in conjunction with other features of Down syndrome, for example during obstetric ultrasonography, it may be an indication for intrauterine sampling for fetal chromosome analysis. Pathophysiology Due to a developmental arrest there is an abnormal alignment of the joint surfaces at either interphalangeal joint causing angulation in the plane of the palm. The finger may be slightly bent or have a very prominent bend. Diagnosis There is no consensus on what degree of angulation justifies a diagnosis; an incline between 15° and 30° is typical. A similar-sounding term, camptodactyly, is a fixed flexion deformity of a digit. Management Treatment is only necessary if the degree of curvature is sufficient to cause disability or if it causes emotional distress. Splinting does not routinely correct the deformity. Surgical treatments are closing wedge osteotomy, opening wedge osteotomy, and reversed wedge osteotomy. Radiographs of the fingers are useful in planning the surgical procedure. Severe clinodactyly may require soft tissue alterations to the digit such as release of skin, extensor tendon relocation, and collateral ligament advancement. Epidemiology Minor degrees of curvature are common. Reports of incidence vary between 1% and 19.5%.

It is monotypic within the genus Pseudhymenochirus. It is found in southern Guinea-Bissau, western Guinea, and southern Sierra Leone. Taxonomy and evolution Genus Pseudhymenochirus has also been placed as a subgenus in Hymenochirus (African dwarf frogs), although it is geographically widely separated from that genus. At any rate, these two genera are probably sister groups. In most species in the family Pipidae, sound production occurs without externally visible movements of the flanks or throat and is based on a different mechanism than in anurans in general. This is interpreted as an adaptation to their aquatic lifestyle. However, within pipids, Hymenochirus appears to be an exception, and sound production is based on moving air in a more conventional anuran manner. Nevertheless, molecular and morphological analyses show that sound production in Hymenochirus is an evolutionary novelty that represents a reversal to the ancestral condition of air-driven sound production. Habitat and conservation Pseudhymenochirus merlini is a largely aquatic frog that lives in aquatic habitats with shade, e.g., still water in lowland forests and agricultural land, and in small, very slow-moving rocky streams. It avoids waterbodies with many fish. It can colonize newly created aquatic habitats by migrating overland. Pseudhymenochirus merlini is common where it occurs. It is harvested for local food consumption, which is posing some threat to it. Also logging of shading trees and introduced predatory fish can locally have negative impacts, but overall this species in not threatened.

History  Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the philosophy of design to a search for a design science. The essay \\"Ornament and Crime\\" by Adolf Loos from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture,Le Corbusier, Vers une architecture\\" (1923) and Victor Papanek's Design for the real world (1972). In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the De Stijl movement promoted a geometrical abstract, \\"ascetic\\" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the Bauhaus movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics. For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle at the Royal Danish Academy. An example of early design science was Altshuller's Theory of inventive problem solving, known as TRIZ, from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 The sciences of the artificial began a more scientific basis to the study of design. Since then the further development of fields such as design methods, design research, design science and design thinking has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

The team of scientist Russ Bradford (James Craig), mining expert Martin \\"Marty\\" Melville (Lon Chaney Jr.) and pilot Lee Brand (Tom Drake) fly into an unknown territory. While searching the area, however, they uncover giant mutated earth animals such as giant snakes, lizards, behemoth bugs and oversized mammals. More importantly, they encounter a mutated 25-ft tall, one- eyed human monster who became disfigured due to an exposure to radioactivity from massive radium deposits in the area, responsible for the unusual size of all the other giant inhabitants of the region. He kills Melville but appears to recognize the girl. When the cyclops tries to prevent the rest of the group from flying to safety, he is wounded and presumably dies.

Etymology The specific name boumbaensis refers to the type locality (Mawa) that is within the Boumba River drainage. Description Adult males can grow to and females to in snout–vent length. All Xenopus are characterized by a streamlined and flattened body, a vocal organ specialized for underwater sound production, lateral-line organs, claws on the innermost three toes, and fully webbed toes. The coloration is green with numerous spots posteriorly and on the hind limbs. The venter can be immaculate white but is often heavily spotted. Xenopus boumbaensis is an octoploid species (2n=72). Habitat and conservation This species occurs in aquatic habitats in the lowland rainforest region at elevations of above sea level. It is typically found in forested habitats in slow-flowing forest streams and springs, but may also be found in swamps. Reproduction presumably involves free-living larvae. It is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation as well as water pollution.

DIN 41612 is a DIN standard for electrical connectors that are widely used in rack based electrical systems. Standardisation of the connectors is a pre-requisite for open systems, where users expect components from different suppliers to operate together. The most widely known use of DIN 41612 connectors is in the VMEbus system. They were also used by NuBus.

The Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists, or OACETT, is a not-for-profit, self-governing organization in Ontario, Canada. It is a professional association that promotes the interests of engineering and applied science technicians and technologists to industry, educational institutions, government and with the public. It currently has 24,000+ members. History The OACETT logo celebrating their 50th anniversary. In 1956, a certification program for technicians and technologists was started by the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario (APEO), now known as Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO). The first certifications were granted on June 5, 1957. OACETT was incorporated in 1962 by the APEO. APEO reserved the post-nominal \\"CET\\" under the federal Trademarks Act, and later transferred ownership to OACETT. OACETT played a role in the 1973 formation of the Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists (CCTT), a federal parent organization with which OACETT was affiliated. By 1977, OACETT's Bylaw 15 had adequately established its own registration board separate from the APEO, asserting its independence. In 1984, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario granted OACETT self-governing status, with Royal Assent of the OACETT Act, Statutes of Ontario. The act recognized OACETT as a professional body whose main objective is to establish and maintain high standards for the engineering and applied science technician and technologist professions. The Association's disciplinary and registration tribunals became formalized and subject to the Statutory Powers Procedure Act and Judicial Review Procedure Act, with their decisions appealable to the Divisional Court of the Superior Court of Ontario. These statutes reserved titles and their respective post-nominals, making their use by non-members unlawful under the Provincial Offences Act and triable by the Ontario Court of Justice.http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&BillID;=1800&ParlSessionID;=36:2&isCurrent;=false Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists Act of Ontario In 1998, a revised version of the OACETT act was passed by the Ontario Legislature. In 2006, like other self-governing and self-regulating professional bodies in Ontario, OACETT's registration and admissions procedures became subject to the Fair Access to the Regulated Professions Act. In 2010, OACETT withdrew from CCTT and no longer has an affiliation. They are now affiliated with Technology Professionals Canada, an organization they helped found. Certification The Institute of Engineering Technology of Ontario (IETO) is the section of OACETT responsible for certification. It includes a panel of professional members that evaluates applications for certification and registers engineering and applied science technicians and technologists who meet established Canadian standards in education and experience. OACETT confers the post-nominal designations of C.Tech. (Certified Technician), C.E.T. (Certified Engineering Technologist), and A.Sc.T. (Applied Science Technologist). These titles and their respective post-nominal abbreviations are legally protected under the OACETT Act for use only by certified members, in the same manner that the PEO protects the use of the P.Eng. (professional engineer) designation. The 1995 agreement on internal trade (amended since), agreed upon by all provinces except Nunavut, lays out the general principles of transferability of professional certifications between provinces. 1995 Agreement on Internal Trade Specifically, chapter 7 spells out the principles of professional certificationhttp://www.ait- aci.ca/labour_en/pdf/chapter7_text_en.pdf Certifications from any province can be transferred to another province by filling out an inter-provincial transfer form.http://www.oacett.org/downloads/become_a_member/Inter- ProvincialTransferForm.pdf Unlike the Red Seal Journeyman certification, which is automatically and freely recognized in all provinces and territories, Membership in one provincial organization does not automatically and freely provide the ability to use the C.E.T. designation in all provinces. For example, in the province of Ontario, being a member of the Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists Association of Manitoba does not provide the ability to use the C.E.T. title in Ontario. The options available are to either transfer their membership to OACETT, or to maintain a membership in both provinces.http://jasonfirth.ca/entries/entry20.php Article: \\"Certified Engineering Technologist? Not here you're not!\\" MTO (Ministry of Transportation Ontario) Designations issued by OACETT include: * RCJI - Road Construction Junior Inspector; * RCSI - Road Construction Senior Inspector; and * RCCA - Road Construction Contract Administrator. Governance and operation Although OACETT interacts closely with the provincial and federal governments, it is not a governmental organization, and receives no governmental funding. OACETT's activities are primarily funded by annual membership dues. The association's affairs are governed by an elected council of technician and technologist members. Much of the association's operation is aided by volunteer members.

It is a small, dark-coloured, fully aquatic frog with a length of , males being slightly smaller than females. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated this frog as \\"critically endangered\\" on the basis of its small area of occurrence at a single location, and the possibility that introduction of non-native fish into the lake could cause the frog to be wiped out.  Description  Lake Oku clawed frogs are small, with males growing to an average of 28–31 mm and females 32–36 mm. The name results from the claws at the ends of its two hind feet. Its back is brown, the belly is speckled black on an orange background. These frogs also have an unusually high number of chromosomes, 12 sets. It is fully aquatic, never observed to come out of the water.  Distribution  The Lake Oku clawed frog lives exclusively in Lake Oku, a small crater lake in northwest Cameroon.  Conservation  The Lake Oku clawed frog was assessed to be critically endangered during the IUCN's 2004 Global Amphibian Assessment. This is because of its small range- size (one single crater lake) and the likelihood that fish could be introduced to the lake. The lake in which it lives and the surrounding forest are an official government protected area (a \\"Plantlife Sanctuary\\"). This and the wider Kilum-Ijim forest (about 20,000 ha) have been subjected to a community forest conservation project facilitated by BirdLife International, the core work concluding in the early 2000s, but with minor projects continuing. The population of X. longipes has been studied by researchers in collaboration with the local community since 2006, including studying the lake's ecology. In 2013, a workshop with the local Oku community (including the Fon of Oku) drafted a conservation action plan to conserve Lake Oku, its surrounding forest and biodiversity such as X. longipes. Captive populations have been established at several zoos, including ZSL-London Zoo (UK) (since 2008) and the Steinhart Aquarium of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco (USA) (since 2013). The general aim has been to research how to set up a captive assurance colony in event of extinction in the wild. In 2014, breeding was successfully achieved at ZSL-London Zoo.

Most of the road is the old route of US-89/US-91, and once extended further along that old alignment in each direction. Route description The route begins at a partial diamond interchange at I-15 on exit 317. The highway heads east on 400 North, a four- lane undivided highway. The route continues through Bountiful and turns north on Main Street, a two-lane undivided road. The route continues north into Centerville. North of Chase Lane, the road begins turning northwest. By Lund Lane, the road heads due north again. By this point, the route becomes 200 East. As the highway enters Farmington, 200 East becomes State Street. Immediately after, the route turns north on Main Street. The route then turns northwest and continues in this manner until a diamond interchange with US-89 at exit 396, where it terminates. History SR-106 was created on May 12, 1931 as a bypass of State Route 1 (US-91) from southern Bountiful to northern Farmington. (This is now the route taken by US-89, mostly overlapping I-15, the former crossing of South 500 West and South Main Street in Bountiful and SR-273 in Farmington). US-91 was moved to the bypass, and, for a while, the old route (still SR-1) was signed as U.S. Route 91 Alternate.Rand McNally and Company, Road map: Idaho, Mont., Wyo., published by Texaco, 1937 In 1953, the Utah State Legislature switched SR-1 and SR-106, taking SR-106 along the older route, and extended SR-106 north along former SR-1 to southern Layton (now exit 330 of I-15) in conjunction with a new bypass of SR-1 south of Layton. (The rest of old SR-106 in northern Farmington became an extension of SR-49, now US-89.) A minor change on May 8, 1961 moved SR-106 from Main Street west to 200 West through Bountiful, taking southbound SR-106 over the Parkin Overpass at its south end. SR-106 was further extended south along old SR-1 to the north side of Salt Lake City (I-15 exit 312) in 1962, when SR-1 was moved to match the planned Interstate 15, and north via Ogden to the Utah Hot Springs (I-15 exit 351) on November 25, 1966, replacing more of SR-1.Utah Department of Transportation, Route 106 history, updated February 2006 This extension of SR-106 through Ogden only lasted until 1969; that year, the State Legislature removed the part between 200 North in Kaysville and the I-15 interchange (now exit 330) in southern Layton, and redesignated the part from southern Layton north to Utah Hot Springs as SR-84. On March 7, 1969, the Utah State Department of Highways (now the Utah Department of Transportation) added Shepard Lane in northern Farmington to the state highway system, from SR-106 west to US-89 (SR-49). SR-106 was rerouted over this roadway, ending at US-89, in order to eliminate a hazardous intersection where US-89 and SR-106 had crossed. The former SR-106 was renumbered SR-272 south of and SR-273 north of this intersection. The old alignment north of Shepard Lane, where still state- maintained, has since become SR-273, SR-126, SR-26, and US-89. As part of the 1977 renumbering, the short piece of SR-106 between Becks and the Parkin Overpass, which was signed as US-89, officially became part of that route. State Route 131 was added to the state highway system on June 26, 1933 as a loop off SR-1 through Woods Cross. It began at South Main Street and South 800 West and preceded north on 800 West and east on 400 North to North Main Street. As part of the change to SR-106 (which had replaced SR-1 at the north end of SR-131) made on May 8, 1961, SR-131 was truncated from North Main Street to North 200 West, since this portion was now SR-106. SR-131 was truncated to run only along 400 North, from I-15 (SR-1) east to SR-106, by the 1969 State Legislature; most of the former route was deleted from the state highway system, but the southernmost part on 800 West, connecting US-89 (SR-106) to I-15 (SR-1), became an extension of SR-93, which ran east from this I-15 interchange to US-89. (This extension of SR-93 was removed from the state highway system in 1985, but the original piece remains.Utah Department of Transportation, Route 93 history, updated November 2002) A short extension to SR-131 was made on April 25, 1997, adding 400 North from I-15 west over the Union Pacific Railroad's Salt Lake Subdivision to the route.Utah Department of Transportation, Route 131 history, updated November 2005 In early 2001, the city of Bountiful requested that UDOT give up maintenance on the part of SR-106 along 200 West between 500 South (SR-68) and 400 North (SR-131). The state agreed on February 9, 2001, and SR-106 took over what had been SR-131. The portion of SR-106 from SR-68 south to the Parkin Overpass became an extension of SR-68. SR-131 was reused in 2016.

It is endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Its natural habitat is temperate forests and it is probable that many nest in trees. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The clouded salamander can grow to about total length. It is long and slim with relatively long legs, square ends to its toes and a prehensile tail. It has two naso-labial grooves joining its nostrils to its mouth and sixteen costal grooves down its flank. The upper side is pale grey variously blotched with gold, olive green or dull red. The juvenile has a brass-colored streak down the center of its back. Distribution and habitat The clouded salamander is found in the Cascadian bioregion of North America at heights up to . Its range extends from the Columbia River southwards through the Cascade Mountains, along the Oregon coast to the northern tip of California in Del Norte County. It lives in forested areas favoring moist areas with few trees rather than dry dense stands. It hides under logs and rocks, under loose bark, in rotting logs and in crevices in rock and scree. It particularly favors rotting Douglas fir logs. It is often common in newly cleared areas with tree stumps and debris. Biology The clouded salamander feeds on small invertebrates, mainly woodlice, ants and beetles, but also include flies, termites, mites, centipedes, millipedes, spiders and pseudoscorpions. Breeding takes place in June and July with females laying clutches of nine to seventeen eggs, usually in chambers hollowed out in rotting logs. The larvae develop inside the eggs, emerging as juveniles in about two months, thus bypassing the free-living larval stage. One or both parents may provide care for the eggs before they hatch. Status The clouded salamander is listed as \\"near threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because numbers seem to be declining and this may be associated with changes in forest management. This salamander's favored microhabitat of tree stumps and coarse woody decaying debris are being replaced by changes in forestry practices. However, plans to conserve the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) and the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) may help to reduce the decline in numbers of clouded salamanders.

In 1969, he moved to southern California and gained a job as a furniture salesman.The couple divorced a few years later.  Art forgery  By 1973, Tetro was studying art by reading books and visiting museums. He never underwent formal art training or a desire to develop his own style, but he liked to paint and he liked copying from the masters. He found the exercise taught him more about the art, enabled him to understand why an artist had done a particular thing, which merely looking at a painting did not reveal.Copying, sketching or making studies from old masters is a common way for art students and artists to learn how to draw and paint. A tour description at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston says, \\"Artists in subsequent generations looked back to the work of Titian and others by visiting museums and making sketches of their work to learn the art of painting. This tour of Old Master paintings in the MFAH collection from the Renaissance through the 18th century explores how future artists would learn the skills of drawing, coloration, and composition from the artists who came before them.\\" (See \\"Members Tour: Learning from the Old Masters\\".) He learned about paper and canvas and experimented to find ways of producing craquelure, a characteristic of old paintings. Still a hobby, he began selling his copies at art fairs. He then began copying photographs and painting portraits. His hobby became a business and he became known within wealthy circles. The art market expanded in the 1980s and according to one Los Angeles art dealer, some people were more concerned about matching their carpet than they were about the authenticity of a painting. Reproductions were in demand and Tetro had a reputation for making flawless copies, even going so far as to travel to Europe to buy wooden stretchers and canvas particular to where a certain artist had worked. He has said that he never marketed his paintings and lithographs as originals and his business card read, \\"Tony Tetro. Art reproductions.\\" Dealers told him his work would be sold to people who couldn't afford originals. Tetro forged works by both contemporary painters and old masters including Rembrandt, Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí and Norman Rockwell. In addition to copying paintings, Tetro made an exact replica of a 1958 Ferrari TR, investing several hundred thousand dollars over six years.Philip P.

He gambled in Monte Carlo and frequently traveled to Paris and Rome. With no visible source of income, local police and residents assumed he was a drug dealer and his car was frequently searched. Tetro denied being a drug dealer, but the more he defended himself, the less he was believed.

It is endemic to the United States. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and temperate grassland. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The black salamander can grow to long. The color varies but can be all black, black with coarse or fine white spots, black with yellow spots or black with a greyish or greenish sheen. The underside is paler. Juveniles are greenish-grey or bronze and have yellow at the base of their legs. Distribution and habitat The black salamander is found in forested areas and grassland in the coastal ranges of south western United States mostly at elevations below but occasionally up to . It has several disjunctive populations. The southernmost population is in the Santa Cruz Mountains. North of this there is a gap where it does not occur and then another population in northern California and southern Oregon. The Black Salamander has a long tail. It has a lot of spots on its tail. In the southern part of its range it hides under logs and rocks in damp places and stream banks in woodland. Northern populations are found in more open country and in the far north of its range it is found among mossy rocks and scree. Biology The black salamander is mostly terrestrial but has a prehensile tail so may sometimes climb as does the related arboreal salamander Aneides lugubris. It feeds on small invertebrates such as millipedes, beetles, ants and termites. Juveniles have a similar diet but include flies and springtails. Like other plethodont salamanders, it is mainly nocturnal and hides during the day. The breeding habits of the black salamander have been little studied. The eggs are laid in July or August in underground chambers, where they are attached by short stalks to the moist soil. The female seems to guard the eggs until they hatch. In captivity, the black salamander is aggressive towards its own species and adults in the wild are often scarred, so the species is probably territorial. In the laboratory it has been known to bite the western garter snake when attacked. Status The black salamander is listed as \\"Near threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it is threatened by habitat loss and even where its environment remains undergraded, it seems to be declining in numbers. In some areas it has been displaced by the planting of vineyards.

It is endemic to mountainous regions of New Mexico in the United States. Its natural habitat is temperate forests where it is threatened by habitat loss. Distribution and habitat The Sacramento Mountain salamander occurs in three separate mountainous areas in New Mexico, the Capitan Mountains, the Sierra Blanca range and the Sacramento Mountains. It is found at heights of at least above sea level in mixed forests. It typically occurs on north or east facing slopes among Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce and white fir, often with an understory of Rocky Mountain maple. It often hides in the leaf litter or rotten logs, under rocks, fallen branches or vegetation. Above the tree line it is found in stony areas with mosses and lichens. The only other salamander occurring in this area is the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) and that is more of a lowland species and prefers grasslands, savannahs and woodland edges. Biology The Sacramento Mountain salamander feeds on small invertebrates such as ants, rove beetles, springtails, snails and spiders. It is itself preyed on by the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans). Breeding takes place in the summer with eggs being laid in small clutches inside rotten logs and stumps and also possibly in underground cavities. The larvae undergo direct development in the eggs with fully formed miniature salamanders hatching out measuring about in snout to vent length. Status The Sacramento Mountain salamander is assessed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is common in the areas in which it occurs and is chiefly threatened by logging activities especially when associated with fire or the removal of fallen timber. Under current logging practices, it is believed that populations are stable.

It is native to California in the United States and is thought to be introduced to British Columbia, Canada, possibly from the importation of oak bark for the tanning industry. Its natural habitat is temperate forests. It is threatened by habitat loss from logging. Description The wandering salamander is very similar in appearance to the clouded salamander (Aneides ferreus) and was at one time considered to be the same species. It is long and slender and grows to a snout to vent length of and a total length of . The head is broader in males than in females. Between the nostrils and the mouth it has a pair of naso-labial grooves which are involved in chemoreception and it has sixteen costal grooves on either side of the body. The legs are relatively long and the toes have expanded terminal pads with square cut ends. The tail is prehensile and is round in cross section and used when the salamander clambers around among the branches of trees. The back varies in colour from brown to light grey, mottled or marbled and speckled with bronze flecks. It sometimes has a greenish sheen. The juveniles have a bronze stripe down the spine. Distribution and habitat The clouded salamander was traditionally thought to have a range that extended from northern California through Oregon and north to Vancouver Island, but it is absent from the state of Washington. In 1998, Jackman examined the mitochondrial DNA and allozymes of populations from various parts of the range and determined that those from California and Vancouver Island were similar but were distinct from the populations found in Oregon. He named the species from the two extremities as Aneides vagrans, the wandering salamander, while retaining the name Aneides ferreus for the Oregon population. It seems likely that A. vagrans arrived in Vancouver Island during the nineteenth century as the result of the import of large sheets of tan oak bark from California for the tanning industry. In the next century the salamander spread to nearly all the small offshore islets round Vancouver Island, probably on rafts of logs. In California it inhabits a narrow coastal strip of forested land with redwood, Douglas fir, cedar and alder. It prefers clearings or forest edges and may be abundant in recently cleared areas with tree stumps, fallen trees and woody debris. In Vancouver Island it is more widely distributed. It occurs from sea level to . Biology The wandering salamander climbs up to in the branches of trees. It feeds at night on small invertebrates such as ants, mites, adult beetles and their larvae, snails, springtails and woodlice. During the day it hides under fallen trees, under rocks, in crevices, under bark and in rotten wood. It has no lungs or gills, and breathes through its skin. For this reason it must keep moist at all times. In California it may aestivate in summer and be active in winter while in Vancouver Island it may be active in summer and hibernate in winter. Breeding takes place in spring and early summer. The female lays a clutch of six to nine eggs in some concealed location such as under bark. She guards them as they develop and they eventually hatch directly into miniature adult salamanders with no aquatic larval stage. Status The wandering salamander is listed as \\"Near Threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because numbers seem to be declining and its habitat is threatened by changes in logging practices whereby there is less cut forest with large amounts of woody debris.

He worked to build the Greek Catholic Church in the first few decades after the Union of Brest of 1596; he also reformed the Basilian monks. Early life The family name of Joseph Velyaminov-Rutski (father Feliks Velyaminov from Moscow and mother Bahumila Korsak) lived in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, had Ruthenian origins and was noble and Calvinist. Joseph's father Feliks Velyaminov belonged to Rurik dynasty; he escaped Moscovy while the reign of Ivan the Terrible. Ivan Velyaminov was born in 1574 and, according to a use of noble families, was named after the estate where he was born, Ruta, thus he was named Ivan Velaminov-Rutski. At 17 he moved in Prague where he studied under the Jesuits and converted to the Catholic Church of Latin Rite against the will of his parents. From 1593-1596, Rutski studied philosophy at Wurtzburg. After the death of his father, his mother, who remained a Calvinist, opposed Rutski's desire to enter in religious live, and stopped to support his studies. But Rustki continued his studies in the St. Athanasius Greek College in Rome, where he was authorized by Pope Clement VIII to change from the Latin Rite to the Byzantine Rite. Rutski completed his studies in 1603. Metropolitan of Kiev Jan Rutski was sent to Vilnius by Pope Clement VIII in 1605 and entered the Monastery of the Holy Trinity there in 1607 where he took the monastic name Jazep (Joseph). After was named archimandrite of the monastery, in 1611 he was appointed coadjutor bishop of Kiev and consecrated as bishop by Metropolitan Hypatius Pociej in June 1611. On Paciej's death in 1613, Joseph Velamin-Rutski became Metropolitan Joseph IV of Kiev. He was assisted by Josaphat Kuncevyc, with whom he worked beginning at the Monastery of the Holy Trinity. After becoming metropolitan, Rutski consecrated Jasaphat as coadjutor of the Archbishop of Polotsk with the title of Bishop of Vitebsk.Ludvik Nemec, “The Ruthenian Uniate Church in Its Historical Perspective,” Church History; Vol. 37, No. 4 (Dec., 1968), pp. 365-388 In 1617, Metropolitan Rutski united a number of monasteries into the Congregation of the Holy Trinity of the Order of Saint Basil the Great. He died February 5, 1637 and is buried in Vilnius. His cause for beatification was begun in 1937.

Its natural habitats are California interior chaparral and woodlands and temperate grasslands in the lower foothills of the western Sierra Nevada and the eastern Central Valley in California, United States. Description The gregarious slender salamander is a small, slender species with a narrow head, short limbs, small hands and feet and a long tail that tapers near the tip. It has a brown dorsal band of colour, blackish back and sides dotted with white specks grading to a pale grey ventral region. The dorsal band starts at a golden-brown to tan region on the neck and extends along the spine as far as the tail. It varies in colour in different individuals from light brown, with dark flecks and bright highlights, to a much darker colour. The maximum snout-to-vent length of an adult is less than . Distribution and habitat The gregarious slender salamander is endemic to the western slopes of the southern and central Sierra Nevada in California, United States. It occurs at altitudes of up to 1,800 m (6,000 ft) but in the southern parts of its range seldom occurs above 900 m (3,000 ft). Its range includes riparian zones in the Central Valley and it is common in southern Tulare County and northern Kern County in the drainages of the White River and its tributary, the Arrastre Creek. The habitat is quite variable over different parts of the range but is mainly relatively open oak woodland with interior live oak (Quercus wislizeni), blue oak (Quercus douglasii) and foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana), or sometimes mixed coniferous forest with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), incense cedar (Calocedrus), white fir (Abies concolor) and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). In the north of its range, it is plentiful in coniferous forest with sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and near the Kern River, in the south of its range, it is found in dry grassland with scattered boulders. Reproduction Reproduction is seasonal in this species. In the southern part of its range and at lower elevations, egg laying usually takes place soon after the start of the rainy season, but at higher elevations it takes place later. The female deposits a clutch of eggs in a well-hidden location, under bark, under a fallen log or a rock, or in leaf-litter in a moist place, often near a seep or stream. Usually, the eggs are laid in communal nests. Such nests have been found with over 300 eggs which are estimated to have been deposited there by more than 18 females. Larger females tend to produce larger clutches, and the mean clutch size of females from the northern part of the range is 15.3 while that for the southern part is 7.3. Once laid, the eggs are not guarded by the mother, although male adults and young salamanders may continue to take refuge nearby. The eggs develop directly into miniature versions of the adult without there being an intervening larval stage. In the laboratory they take 65 to 73 days to hatch and they may take a similar length of time in the wild. Status The IUCN lists the gregarious slender salamander as being of \\"Least Concern\\". It occurs in a range of habitat types and the population seems to be stable. No particular threats have been identified for this species apart from the destruction of its habitat.

Her Swedish language books have been translated into several languages, including Finnish, Danish, German, Russian and Dutch. Biography Lundberg made her debut at age 15 with the poetry anthology Utgångspunkt in 1962. In 1964, she spent some time in the United States on a scholarship. She subsequently wrote of her experiences in the US. Lundberg also wrote a book about Japan after living there in 1968. Her breakthrough is generally considered to be the 1976 book Kökar, a factual account of the past and present of her island of birth, told through the stories of some of the islanders. She would later write two novels about the fictional Kökar native Anna in Kungens Anna and Ingens Anna. She would write extensively about Africa (the fictional Tre afrikanska berättelser, Sand and Regn and the factual Öar i Afrikas inre), having lived for two years in the African nations of Botswana, Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania. After obtaining her Master's degree in 1985 from Åbo Akademi University, Lundberg spent the academic year of 1986–1987 as a lecturer and writer in residence at the University of Minnesota. Save for this one year at the University of Minnesota, Lundberg has worked her entire professional life as an author and continues to do so. In 1993, Lundberg published Sibirien, which, in addition to being an autobiography, is an account of four-month-long stays in Siberia. This has been the most internationally successful of her books. Among her other works, the most notable include the acclaimed seafaring trilogy of Leo, Stora världen and Allt man kan önska sig, a series of fact- based, fictional novels detailing the history and evolution of shipping in Åland/Finland. She has received numerous awards for her writing, including Runebergspriset and the prize for Finnish authors awarded by the Swedish Academy. In 1993, Lundberg was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts by Åbo Akademi University. Between 1994 and 1999, Lundberg held the title Professor of Arts. She has been nominated three times for Finland's top literary award the Finlandia Prize, and in 2012 she won the prize with the Swedish-language novel Is. Ulla-Lena Lundberg is featured on a stamp issued on 21 March 2009 by Åland Post, the postal authority of the Åland Islands. The stamp, by the artist Juha Pykäläinen, is a portrait of Lundberg next to a depiction of the ship Leo, from the first book of her trilogy about Åland shipping. The stamp is part of a stamp booklet called Åland Authors, and also includes a stamp featuring Anni Blomqvist and a stamp featuring Valdemar Nyman. Ulla-Lena Lundberg's novel Ice was awarded the Finlandia prize, Finland's most prestigious literary award, in 2012. With domestic sales of almost 150 000 copies, it has become one of the most cherished Finnish novels of the decade. Partly based on the life on Lundberg's own family on the isolated island of Kökar, Ice has attracted much interest from theatres, but the Finnish National Opera was the first to get permission to adapt it for the stage. The libretto follows the key events and characters of the rich novel, with music that rings with the changing seasons and the ever-present threat of ice.

For example the centroid, circumcenter, incenter and orthocenter were familiar to the ancient Greeks, and can be obtained by simple constructions. Each of these classical centers has the property that it is invariant (more precisely equivariant) under similarity transformations. In other words, for any triangle and any similarity transformation (such as a rotation, reflection, dilation, or translation), the center of the transformed triangle is the same point as the transformed center of the original triangle. This invariance is the defining property of a triangle center. It rules out other well-known points such as the Brocard points which are not invariant under reflection and so fail to qualify as triangle centers. All centers of an equilateral triangle coincide at its centroid, but they generally differ from each other on scalene triangles. The definitions and properties of thousands of triangle centers have been collected in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. History Even though the ancient Greeks discovered the classic centers of a triangle they had not formulated any definition of a triangle center. After the ancient Greeks, several special points associated with a triangle like the Fermat point, nine-point center, Lemoine point, Gergonne point, and Feuerbach point were discovered. During the revival of interest in triangle geometry in the 1980s it was noticed that these special points share some general properties that now form the basis for a formal definition of triangle center. , Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers contains an annotated list of 39,474 triangle centers. Formal definition A real-valued function f of three real variables a, b, c may have the following properties: *Homogeneity: f(ta,tb,tc) = tn f(a,b,c) for some constant n and for all t > 0. *Bisymmetry in the second and third variables: f(a,b,c) = f(a,c,b). If a non-zero f has both these properties it is called a triangle center function. If f is a triangle center function and a, b, c are the side- lengths of a reference triangle then the point whose trilinear coordinates are f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b) is called a triangle center. This definition ensures that triangle centers of similar triangles meet the invariance criteria specified above. By convention only the first of the three trilinear coordinates of a triangle center is quoted since the other two are obtained by cyclic permutation of a, b, c. This process is known as cyclicity. Every triangle center function corresponds to a unique triangle center. This correspondence is not bijective. Different functions may define the same triangle center. For example the functions f1(a,b,c) = 1/a and f2(a,b,c) = bc both correspond to the centroid. Two triangle center functions define the same triangle center if and only if their ratio is a function symmetric in a, b and c. Even if a triangle center function is well-defined everywhere the same cannot always be said for its associated triangle center. For example let f(a, b, c) be 0 if a/b and a/c are both rational and 1 otherwise. Then for any triangle with integer sides the associated triangle center evaluates to 0:0:0 which is undefined. Default domain In some cases these functions are not defined on the whole of ℝ3. For example the trilinears of X365 are a1/2 : b1/2 : c1/2 so a, b, c cannot be negative. Furthermore in order to represent the sides of a triangle they must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, in practice, every function's domain is restricted to the region of ℝ3 where a ≤ b + c, b ≤ c + a, and c ≤ a + b. This region T is the domain of all triangles, and it is the default domain for all triangle-based functions. Other useful domains There are various instances where it may be desirable to restrict the analysis to a smaller domain than T. For example: :*The centers X3, X4, X22, X24, X40 make specific reference to acute triangles, namely that region of T where a2 ≤ b2 \\\\+ c2, b2 ≤ c2 \\\\+ a2, c2 ≤ a2 \\\\+ b2. :*When differentiating between the Fermat point and X13 the domain of triangles with an angle exceeding 2π/3 is important, in other words triangles for which a2 > b2 \\\\+ bc + c2 or b2 > c2 \\\\+ ca + a2 or c2 > a2 \\\\+ ab + b2. :*A domain of much practical value since it is dense in T yet excludes all trivial triangles (ie points) and degenerate triangles (ie lines) is the set of all scalene triangles. It is obtained by removing the planes b = c, c = a, a = b from T. Domain symmetry Not every subset D ⊆ T is a viable domain. In order to support the bisymmetry test D must be symmetric about the planes b = c, c = a, a = b. To support cyclicity it must also be invariant under 2π/3 rotations about the line a = b = c. The simplest domain of all is the line (t,t,t) which corresponds to the set of all equilateral triangles. Examples A triangle (ΔABC) with centroid (G), incenter (I), circumcenter (O), orthocenter (H) and nine-point center (N) Circumcenter The point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC is the circumcenter. The trilinear coordinates of the circumcenter are :a(b2 \\\\+ c2 − a2) : b(c2 \\\\+ a2 − b2) : c(a2 \\\\+ b2 − c2). Let f(a,b,c) = a(b2 \\\\+ c2 − a2). Then :f(ta,tb,tc) = (ta) ( (tb)2 \\\\+ (tc)2 − (ta)2 ) = t3 ( a( b2 \\\\+ c2 − a2) ) = t3 f(a,b,c) (homogeneity) :f(a,c,b) = a(c2 \\\\+ b2 − a2) = a(b2 \\\\+ c2 − a2) = f(a,b,c) (bisymmetry) so f is a triangle center function. Since the corresponding triangle center has the same trilinears as the circumcenter it follows that the circumcenter is a triangle center. 1st isogonic center Let A'BC be the equilateral triangle having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC and let AB'C and ABC' be similarly constructed equilateral triangles based on the other two sides of triangle ABC. Then the lines AA', BB' and CC' are concurrent and the point of concurrence is the 1st isogonal center. Its trilinear coordinates are :csc(A + π/3) : csc(B + π/3) : csc(C + π/3). Expressing these coordinates in terms of a, b and c, one can verify that they indeed satisfy the defining properties of the coordinates of a triangle center. Hence the 1st isogonic center is also a triangle center. Fermat point Let :f(a, b, c) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\quad \\\\text{if } a^2 > b^2 + bc + c^2 & (\\\\text{equivalently } A > 2\\\\pi/3), \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\quad \\\\text{if } b^2 > c^2 + ca + a^2 \\\\text{ or } c^2 > a^2 + ab + b^2 & (\\\\text{equivalently } B > 2\\\\pi/3 \\\\text{ or } C > 2\\\\pi/3), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\csc(A + \\\\pi/3) & \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise } & (\\\\text{equivalently no vertex angle exceeds } 2\\\\pi/3). \\\\end{cases} Then f is bisymmetric and homogeneous so it is a triangle center function. Moreover the corresponding triangle center coincides with the obtuse angled vertex whenever any vertex angle exceeds 2π/3, and with the 1st isogonic center otherwise. Therefore this triangle center is none other than the Fermat point. Non-examples Brocard points The trilinear coordinates of the first Brocard point are c/b : a/c : b/a. These coordinates satisfy the properties of homogeneity and cyclicity but not bisymmetry. So the first Brocard point is not (in general) a triangle center. The second Brocard point has trilinear coordinates b/c : c/a : a/b and similar remarks apply. The first and second Brocard points are one of many bicentric pairs of points,Bicentric Pairs of Points, Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, accessed 2012-05-02 pairs of points defined from a triangle with the property that the pair (but not each individual point) is preserved under similarities of the triangle. Several binary operations, such as midpoint and trilinear product, when applied to the two Brocard points, as well as other bicentric pairs, produce triangle centers. Position vectors Triangle centers can be written as following :P=\\\\frac{w_A A + w_B B + w_C C} {w_A + w_B + w_C}. Here, P,A,B,C are position vectors, and, coordinates w_A, w_B, w_C are scalars whose definition corresponds each center instances can be seen in the following table, where, a, b, c are side lengths, and, S is area of the triangle that Heron's formula can be utilized to get. {  style=text- align:center; - !  !  w_A !  w_B !  w_C !  w_A+w_B+w_C - Incenter  center;\\" a  center;\\" b  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" c  center;\\" a+b+c - rowspan=\\"3\\"Excenter  center;\\"  -a  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  b  center;\\" c  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" b+c-a -  center;\\" a  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -b  center;\\" c  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" c+a-b -  center;\\" a  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" b  center;\\" -c  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" a+b-c - Centroid  center;\\" 1  center;\\" 1  center;\\" 1  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 3 - Circumcenter  center;\\" a^2(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)  center;\\" b^2(c^2 + a^2 - b^2)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" c^2(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)  center;\\" 16S^2 - Orthocenter  center;\\" a^4 - (b^2 - c^2)^2  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" b^4 - (c^2 - a^2)^2  center;\\" c^4 - (a^2 - b^2)^2  center;\\" 16S^2 } :a\\\\equiv\\\\overline{BC}=\\\\sqrt{(\\\\vec{BC},\\\\vec{BC})}, :b\\\\equiv\\\\overline{CA}=\\\\sqrt{(\\\\vec{CA},\\\\vec{CA})}, :c\\\\equiv\\\\overline{AB}=\\\\sqrt{(\\\\vec{AB},\\\\vec{AB})}, :16S^2=(a^2 + b^2+c^2)^2-2(a^4 + b^4+c^4).

Polynomial triangle center A triangle center P is called a polynomial triangle center if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed as polynomials in a, b and c. Regular triangle center A triangle center P is called a regular triangle point if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed as polynomials in Δ, a, b and c, where Δ is the area of the triangle. Major triangle center A triangle center P is said to be a major triangle center if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed in the form f(A) : f(B) : f(C) where f(A) is a function of the angle A alone and does not depend on the other angles or on the side lengths. Transcendental triangle center A triangle center P is called a transcendental triangle center if P has no trilinear representation using only algebraic functions of a, b and c. Miscellaneous Isosceles and equilateral triangles Let f be a triangle center function. If two sides of a triangle are equal (say a = b) then so two components of the associated triangle center are always equal. Therefore all triangle centers of an isosceles triangle must lie on its line of symmetry. For an equilateral triangle all three components are equal so all centers coincide with the centroid. So, like a circle, an equilateral triangle has a unique center. Excenters Let :f(a, b, c) = \\\\begin{cases} -1 & \\\\quad \\\\text{if } a \\\\ge b \\\\text{ and } a \\\\ge c, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; 1 & \\\\quad \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} This is readily seen to be a triangle center function and (provided the triangle is scalene) the corresponding triangle center is the excenter opposite to the largest vertex angle. The other two excenters can be picked out by similar functions. However as indicated above only one of the excenters of an isosceles triangle and none of the excenters of an equilateral triangle can ever be a triangle center. Biantisymmetric functions A function f is biantisymmetric if f(a,b,c) = −f(a,c,b) for all a,b,c. If such a function is also non-zero and homogeneous it is easily seen that the mapping (a,b,c) → f(a,b,c)2 f(b,c,a) f(c,a,b) is a triangle center function. The corresponding triangle center is f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b). On account of this the definition of triangle center function is sometimes taken to include non-zero homogeneous biantisymmetric functions. New centers from old Any triangle center function f can be normalized by multiplying it by a symmetric function of a,b,c so that n = 0. A normalized triangle center function has the same triangle center as the original, and also the stronger property that f(ta,tb,tc) = f(a,b,c) for all t > 0 and all (a,b,c). Together with the zero function, normalized triangle center functions form an algebra under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This gives an easy way to create new triangle centers. However distinct normalized triangle center functions will often define the same triangle center, for example f and (abc)−1(a+b+c)3f . Uninteresting centers Assume a,b,c are real variables and let α,β,γ be any three real constants. Let :f(a, b, c) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\alpha & \\\\quad \\\\text{ if } a < b \\\\text{ and } a < c \\\\quad \\\\text{(equivalently the first variable is the smallest)}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\quad \\\\text{ if } a > b \\\\text{ and } a > c \\\\quad \\\\text{(equivalently the first variable is the largest)}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta & \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\, \\\\quad \\\\text{(equivalently the first variable is in the middle)}. \\\\end{cases} Then f is a triangle center function and α : β : γ is the corresponding triangle center whenever the sides of the reference triangle are labelled so that a < b < c. Thus every point is potentially a triangle center. However the vast majority of triangle centers are of little interest, just as most continuous functions are of little interest. The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers is an ever-expanding list of interesting ones. Barycentric coordinates If f is a triangle center function then so is af and the corresponding triangle center is af(a,b,c) : bf(b,c,a) : cf(c,a,b). Since these are precisely the barycentric coordinates of the triangle center corresponding to f it follows that triangle centers could equally well have been defined in terms of barycentrics instead of trilinears. In practice it isn't difficult to switch from one coordinate system to the other. Binary systems There are other center pairs besides the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center. Another system is formed by X3 and the incenter of the tangential triangle. Consider the triangle center function given by: :f(a, b, c) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\cos(A) \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\;\\\\,\\\\, \\\\text{if the triangle is acute}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos(A) + \\\\sec(B)\\\\sec(C) \\\\quad \\\\text{if the vertex angle at } A \\\\text{ is obtuse}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos(A) - \\\\sec(A) \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\; \\\\quad \\\\;\\\\, \\\\text{if either of the angles at } B \\\\text{ or } C \\\\text{ is obtuse}. \\\\end{cases} For the corresponding triangle center there are four distinct possibilities: :* cos(A) : cos(B) : cos(C) if the reference triangle is acute (this is also the circumcenter). :* [cos(A) + sec(B)sec(C)] : [cos(B) − sec(B)] : [cos(C) − sec(C)] if the angle at A is obtuse. :* [cos(A) − sec(A)] : [cos(B) + sec(C)sec(A)] : [cos(C) − sec(C)] if the angle at B is obtuse. :* [cos(A) − sec(A)] : [cos(B) − sec(B)] : [cos(C) + sec(A)sec(B)] if the angle at C is obtuse. Routine calculation shows that in every case these trilinears represent the incenter of the tangential triangle. So this point is a triangle center that is a close companion of the circumcenter. Bisymmetry and invariance Reflecting a triangle reverses the order of its sides. In the image the coordinates refer to the (c,b,a) triangle and (using \\"\\" as the separator) the reflection of an arbitrary point α : β : γ is γ  β  α. If f is a triangle center function the reflection of its triangle center is f(c,a,b)  f(b,c,a)  f(a,b,c) which, by bisymmetry, is the same as f(c,b,a)  f(b,a,c)  f(a,c,b). As this is also the triangle center corresponding to f relative to the (c,b,a) triangle, bisymmetry ensures that all triangle centers are invariant under reflection. Since rotations and translations may be regarded as double reflections they too must preserve triangle centers. These invariance properties provide justification for the definition. Alternative terminology Some other names for dilation are uniform scaling, isotropic scaling, homothety, and homothecy. Hyperbolic triangle centers The study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must not encapsulate the specification of the angle sum being 180 degrees.Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates, Abraham A.

Much of what was formerly known as the relictual slender salamander has now gone over to the Greenhorn Mountains slender salamander (Batrachoseps altasierrae), the Fairview slender salamander (Batrachoseps bramei) and the Kern Plateau slender salamander (Batrachoseps robustus). Presently relictual slender salamanders exist at only two sites on Breckenridge Mountain separated by a mere three miles. This locale is south and west of the range of the Kern Canyon slender salamander (Batrachoseps simatus). The species formerly existed to the west in the lower Kern River Canyon (the location of the type locality), but these populations have all gone extinct for unknown reasons. Further down the Kern River Canyon, the Gregarious slender salamander (Batrachoseps gregarius) occurs. The relictual slender salamander's natural habitats are freshwater springs and riparian areas, interior chaparral and woodlands, and temperate coniferous forests. References * 2012.

Corps of drums are commonly found in the Royal Navy and Commonwealth navies, being an integral part of British naval music. There are many customs and traditions associated with the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, many of these traditions have carried on to other Commonwealth navies, such as Canada, India, Australia and New Zealand. These include formal customs including separate crests associated with ships, ensigns and fleet reviews. There are also several less formal customs and traditions including Naval slang commonly referred to as Jack Speak and the traditional games of Uckers and Euchre. Winston Churchill probably never dismissed the customs of the Royal Navy as \\"nothing but rum, sodomy and the lash\\". Heraldry Ensigns Commissioned ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at the stern whilst alongside during daylight hours and at the main-mast whilst under way. When alongside, the Union Jack is flown from the jackstaff at the bow, but can only be flown under way on special circumstances, i.e. when dressed with masthead flags (when it is flown at the jackstaff), to signal a court-martial is in progress (when it is flown from the starboard yardarm), or to indicate the presence of an Admiral of the Fleet, including the Lord High Admiral or the Monarch (when it is flown from the highest hoist). Ships badges The Royal Navy assigns badges to every ship, submarine, squadron and shore establishment. Prior to the age of steam ships, ships were identified by their figurehead. With the removal of the figurehead, ships badges and mottos were created to graphically represent the ships. The official process for creating the badge was initiated by Charles ffoulkes after World War I who was appointed as the Admiralty Advisor on Heraldry. Soon after his appointment The Ships' Badges Committee was established. This was amalgamated in 1983 with the Ships' Names Committee (founded in 1913) to create the Ships' Names and Badges Committee. The Naval Crown adorns the top of all the badges. The frame is gold rope. Originally, different classes of ships had different shapes, but currently all ships and submarines have a circular design. Shore establishments have an offset square design. Ceremonial The Royal Navy uses a number of unique ceremonies which often have their origins in the days of sail. Colours This is the formal ceremony of raising or lowering of a ship's ensign and jack when in port or at anchor. The flags are raised at 09:00; shore establishments only fly the White Ensign. They are lowered either at sunset or at 21:00, whichever is earlier. The lowering ceremony is referred to as \\"Sunset\\" or \\"Evening Colours\\" if it does not coincide with the setting of the sun. It may be accompanied by the \\"Sunset\\" bugle call. Ships at sea fly the White Ensign continuously. Divisions King George VI inspects Divisions aboard HMS Ramillies during the Second World War. A formal parade of a ship's or shore establishment's company. At the Britannia Royal Naval College, the \\"Lord High Admiral's Divisions\\" is a parade held in the presence of the monarch or her representative.Jolly 2014, p. 140 Pipe the side A ceremonial greeting by a guard of honour on the arrival of a flag officer or the commander of another ship, members of the royal family or foreign officers in uniform. The actual piping is done using a boatswain's call and consists of a low note, rising to high and falling to low again, lasting for twelve seconds on a single breath.Jolly 2014, p. 336 Pipe the still A signal made boatswain's call which brings a ship's company to attention, especially for the \\"Colours\\" ceremony or when saluting a passing warship. A second call of \\"carry on!\\" returns the company to their duties. Fleet reviews The Fleet Review is an irregular tradition of assembling the fleet before the monarch. For example, at the most recent Review on 28 June 2005 to mark the bi-centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, 167 ships of the RN, and 30 other nations, were present. The fleet review in 2005 showed the marked contrast between the size of the Navy in 2005 compared to the last review in 1977. In total the Royal Navy had 67 ships on display, with the largest ship present being the French carrier Charles De Gaulle at over 200 feet longer than HMS Invincible. Service nicknames Nicknames for the service include The Andrew or Andrew Miller (of uncertain origin, possibly after a zealous press ganger) and the Senior Service. It is also referred to as the Grey Funnel Line: ship owning companies, or lines, painted their steam ship's funnels in distinctive colours such as Cunard's red and black or the eponymous Blue Funnel Line, and the Royal Navy's funnels are plain grey. Naval salute Originally subordinates would remove their headgear to a superior. In a book called New Art of War, printed in 1740, it is stated that; During the age of sail, ships' officers were always worried about mutiny and it therefore became custom that whenever an officer approached, the rating would prove that he was not armed. This was done by knuckling the forehead and later evolved into the modern Navy salute with the hand at 45 degrees, palm facing in. The reason that the palm faces in is because sailors' hands were covered in tar from the sheets and rigging and it was considered unseemly to show an officer or a member of the Royal family a dirty palm. Toasts The Toasts of the Royal Navy are a set of traditional drinking toasts. {  - !Day !Toast - Sunday  \\"Absent friends\\" - Monday  \\"Our ships at sea\\" - Tuesday  \\"Our sailors\\" (prior to 2013, \\"Our men\\") - Wednesday  \\"Ourselves\\" (usually with the informal reply \\"for nobody else will concern themselves with our well- being!\\") - Thursday  \\"A bloody war or a sickly season\\" - Friday  \\"A willing foe and sea-room\\" - Saturday  \\"Our families\\" (prior to 2013, \\"Our wives and sweetheart,\\" usually with the reply \\"May they never meet!\\") } In June 2013 the Tuesday and Saturday toasts were officially changed under orders from the Second Sea Lord, Vice-Admiral David Steel, to reflect the fact that women have been at sea in the Royal Navy for nearly two decades. Officially the Tuesday toast is now \\"our sailors\\" and the Saturday toast is \\"our families\\". However, the vast majority of personnel ignore the official change, and use the traditional toasts. While most of these toasts are self- explanatory, \\"a bloody war or a sickly season\\" refers to the desire and likelihood of being promoted when many people die: during war or sickness. The toasts are typically given by the youngest officer present at the mess dinner.A. Metaxas, \\"Metaxas' Personal Authoritative Manual on Naval Traditions\\" By tradition, these toasts are proposed immediately after the loyal toast, on the relevant day of the week. The Navy makes the loyal toast seated. This was a special dispensation granted by William IV, who had narrowly missed cracking his head several times on low deckheads when serving in the Royal Navy. Affiliation Ships will engage in a number of affiliations. It is often misunderstood that ships are named after places when normally they are associated with the local lord e.g. the Duke of Marlborough. There were however a number of vessels named after places during World War II after schools, cadet units and charities. At one time every Sea Cadet unit in the UK had an affiliated ship (with the exception of Kettering, which is affiliated with 800 Naval Air Squadron; Yeovilton, now disbanded; and Yeovil unit which, due to its location on RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), is affiliated with 848 Helicopter Squadron). However, now that Sea Cadet units outnumber Royal Navy vessels, this is no longer possible. Naval slang The RN has evolved a rich volume of slang, known as Jackspeak. Nowadays the British sailor is usually Jack (or Jenny) rather than the more historical Jack Tar, which is an allusion to either the former requirement to tar long hair or the tar-stained hands of sailors. Nicknames for a British sailor, applied by others, include Matelot (pronounced \\"matlow\\", and derived from mid 19th century (nautical slang): from French, variant of matenot which was also taken from the Middle Dutch mattenoot ‘bed companion’, because sailors had to share hammocks in twos, and Limey, from the Lime-juice given to British sailors to combat scurvy - mainly redundant in use within the Royal Navy. Royal Marines are fondly known as Bootnecks or often just as Royals. Uckers and Euchre Uckers is a two player board game similar to Ludo that is traditionally played in the Royal Navy. It is fiercely competitive and rules differ between ships and stations (and between other services). Euchre, pronounced you-ker, is a card game also played on board ships, in naval establishments and also in pubs in Cornwall and Devon. It is similar to Trumps, and equally competitive. Euchre involves nominated partners, is played only with the nine card and higher, apart from the two of spades - called the \\"Benny\\" - (making 25 cards in all) and uses the eight and seven cards as a score board. The winner is the first team to score 15. Songs and marches There are several songs that are commonly associated with the Royal Navy including \\"Heart of Oak\\" (the official quick march) and \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" See also *Trafalgar Night: On 21 October each year the commissioned officers of the Royal Navy celebrate the victory at the Battle of Trafalgar by holding a dinner in the officer's mess.

Their range is between northern Mexico through Central America to Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, northeastern Brazil, and central Bolivia. Neotropical salamanders of the Bolitoglossa make up the largest genus in the order Caudata, consisting of approximately one-fifth of all known species of salamanders. Adult salamanders range anywhere from 45mm to 200mm in length depending on their specific species. They are notorious for their ability to project their tongue at prey items, as indicated from their name. They are also known for their webbed feet, having significantly more webbing than any other species outside their genus with the exception of the cave-dwelling Mexican bolitoglossine Chiropterotriton magnipes. Although webbed feet are a common characteristic of these salamanders, only about half of the species in this genus contain webbed feet. Characteristics Hand and foot morphology Hand and foot morphology is strikingly diverse in an otherwise morphologically uniform group. While just under half of these species contain webbing between their fingers and toes, the remaining species experience little to no webbing and undergo elongation of their fingers and toes throughout development. Ultimately, the variation of foot morphology within this genus is primarily due to natural selection. Derived characteristics correspond to arboreal vs. terrestrial salamanders. *Webbed fingers – natural selection to improve terrestrial movement through water. *Elongated fingers – natural selection of increased suction efficiency, favoring a larger surface area of the foot. This also selects for a decreased body size, enabling the salamander to cling trees more easily. Tail autotomy Tail autotomy refers to the salamanders’ ability to release or lose their tail if necessary. This is a common characteristic of nearly all salamanders and lizards. (See autotomy). It is particularly helpful to the salamander in escaping attacks from its predators. Once the tail has been lost, it can regenerate one time. After this regeneration, the tail is incapable of separation with regeneration. Poison Bolitoglossa rostrata and B. subpalmata are two rare examples of poisonous salamanders within their genus. The poison is secreted through their skin as an antipredator mechanism. It is particularly toxic to certain snake species, rendering them immobile and unresponsive to external stimuli upon initial contact. The common defense tactic of these two species is to remain still in the presence of the snake until it makes initial contact (usually by the flickering of its tongue), and then run away as the paralytic poison begins to take effect in the snake. Evolution Natural selection Tropical adaptation of the Bolitoglossa is thought to have evolved from North American plethodontids. Natural selection is responsible for morphological changes shifting from those supporting temperate environments to those supporting tropical environments such as Panama and Costa Rica. Natural selection is thought to have resulted in genetic changes from physical adaptation. The main differences that have developed from natural selection affect the skull and bones of the feet in these salamanders. Due to these primary changes, secondary changes are believed to have followed, including: *Body size *Additional ossification of bones *Webbing *Ear structure Phylogeny of this genus is partially dependent on its variations in bone structure due to the effects of natural selection over a long period of time. Hybridization The first documented case of hybridization in tropical salamanders occurred between B. frankini and B. resplendens. This hybridization has taken a pervasive effect on the morphology of B. resplendens, whereas B. frankini seemed to maintain its same physical structure. Taxonomy Broadfoot Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa platydactyla), Municipality of Ocampo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (11 July 2005). Derived characteristics of the genus Bolitoglossa has led to their classification based on this specific list of characters: *Tongue and hypobranchial apparatus *Epibranchial Number **embryos having a single epibranchial *Tail Autotomy *Brain stem motor control *Bone structure of Jaws, Cranial, and inner ear *Chromosome number **diploid number of chromosomes is 26 *Development Classification of this genus is primarily accomplished through analysis of the salamanders’ DNA. This has proven to be the most effective and accurate way of classifying this genus.

A memory cell typically consists of a single MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), thus multi-level cells reduce the number of MOSFETs required to store the same amount of data as single-level cells. Triple-level cells (TLC) and quad-level cells (QLC) are versions of MLC memory, which can store 3 and 4 bits per cell, respectively. The name \\"multi-level cell\\" is sometimes used specifically to refer to the \\"two-level cell\\". Overall, the memories are named as follows: # Single-Level Cell or SLC (1 bit per cell) # Multi-Level Cell or MLC (2 bits per cell) # Triple-Level Cell or TLC (3 bits per cell) # Quad- Level Cell or QLC (4 bits per cell) # Penta-Level Cell or PLC (5 bits per cell) – currently in development Typically, as the 'Level' count increases, performance (speed and reliability) and consumer cost decrease; however this correlation can vary between manufacturers. Examples of MLC memories are MLC NAND flash, MLC PCM (phase change memory), etc. For example, in SLC NAND flash technology, each cell can exist in one of the two states, storing one bit of information per cell. Most MLC NAND flash memory has four possible states per cell, so it can store two bits of information per cell. This reduces the amount of margin separating the states and results in the possibility of more errors. Multi-level cells which are designed for low error rates are sometimes called enterprise MLC (eMLC). There are tools for modeling the area/latency/energy of MLC memories.\\"DESTINY: A Comprehensive Tool with 3D and Multi-level Cell Memory Modeling Capability\\", Mittal et al., JLPEA, 2017 New technologies, such as multi-level cells and 3D Flash, and increased production volumes will continue to bring prices down.https://www.hyperstone.com/en/NAND- Flash-is-displacing-hard-disk-drives-1249,12728.html, NAND Flash is displacing Hard Disk Drives, Retrieved 29. May 2018  Single-level cell  Flash memory stores data in individual memory cells, which are made of floating-gate MOSFET transistors. Traditionally, each cell had two possible states (each with one voltage level), so one bit of data was stored in each cell in so-called single-level cells, or SLC flash memory. SLC memory has the advantage of higher write speeds, lower power consumption and higher cell endurance. However, because SLC memory stores less data per cell than MLC memory, it costs more per megabyte of storage to manufacture. Due to higher transfer speeds and expected longer life, SLC flash technology is used in high- performance memory cards. In February 2016, a study was published that showed little difference in practice between the reliability of SLC and MLC. A single-level cell (SLC) Flash memory may have a lifetime of about 50,000 to 100,000 program/erase cycles.https://www.hyperstone.com/en/NAND-Flash-is- displacing-hard-disk-drives-1249,12728.html, NAND Flash is displacing Hard Disk Drives, Retrieved 29. May 2018  Multi-level cell  The primary benefit of MLC flash memory is its lower cost per unit of storage due to the higher data density, and memory-reading software can compensate for a larger bit error rate.Micron's MLC NAND Flash Webinar The higher error rate necessitates an error correcting code (ECC) that can correct multiple bit errors; for example, the SandForce SF-2500 Flash Controller can correct up to 55 bits per 512-byte sector with an unrecoverable read error rate of less than one sector per 1017 bits read.SandForce SF-2600/SF-2500 Product Info 2013-10-22 The most commonly used algorithm is Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH code).A Tour of the Basics of Embedded NAND Flash Options EE Times 2013-08-27 Other drawbacks of MLC NAND are lower write speeds, lower number of program-erase cycles and higher power consumption compared to SLC flash memory. Read speeds can also be lower for MLC NAND than SLC due to the need to read the same data at a second threshold voltage to help resolve errors. TLC and QLC devices may need to read the same data up to 4 and 8 times respectively to obtain values that are correctable by ECC. MLC flash may have a lifetime of about 1,000 to 10,000 program/erase cycles. This typically necessitates the use of a flash file system which is designed around the limitations of flash memory, such as using wear leveling to extend the useful lifetime of the flash device. The Intel 8087 used two-bits-per-cell technology, and in 1980 was one of the first devices on the market to use multi-level ROM cells.\\"Four-state cell called density key\\" article by J.

NEC demonstrated quad-level cells in 1996, with a 64Mb flash memory chip storing 2-bit per cell. In 1997, NEC demonstrated a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip with quad-level cells, holding a capacity of 4Gb. STMicroelectronics also demonstrated quad-level cells in 2000, with a 64Mb NOR flash memory chip. some solid-state drives use part of an MLC NAND die as if it were single-bit SLC NAND, giving higher write speeds.Geoff Gasior. \\"Samsung's 840 EVO solid-state drive reviewed: TLC NAND with a shot of SLC cache\\". 2013.Allyn Malventano. \\"New Samsung 840 EVO employs TLC and pseudo-SLC TurboWrite cache\\". 2013.Samsung. \\"Samsung Solid State Drive: TurboWrite Technology White Paper\\". 2013. nearly all commercial MLCs are planar-based (i.e. cells are built on silicon surface) and so subject to scaling limitations. To address this potential problem, the industry is already looking at technologies that can guarantee storage density increases beyond today’s limitations. One of the most promising is 3D Flash, where cells are stacked vertically, thereby avoiding the limitations of planar scaling.https://www.hyperstone.com/en/Solid-State-bit-density-and-the-Flash- Memory-Controller-1235,12728.html - Solid State bit Density and the Flash Memory Controller, Retrieved 29.

It claims to last longer and be more reliable than normal MLCs while providing cost savings over traditional SLC drives. Although many SSD manufacturers have produced MLC drives slated for enterprise use, only Micron sells raw NAND Flash chips under this designation.  Triple-level cell  A Triple Level Cell (TLC) is a type of NAND flash memory that stores three bits of information per cell. Toshiba introduced memory with triple-level cells in 2009. Samsung announced a type of NAND flash that stores three bits of information per cell, with eight total voltage states, coining the term \\"Triple Level Cell\\" (\\"TLC\\"). Samsung Electronics began mass-producing it in 2010, and it was first seen in Samsung's 840 Series SSDs. Samsung refers to this technology as 3-bit MLC. The negative aspects of MLC are amplified with TLC, but TLC benefits from still higher storage density and lower cost. In 2013, Samsung introduced V-NAND (Vertical NAND, also known as 3D NAND) with triple-level cells, which had a memory capacity of 128Gb. They expanded their TLC V-NAND technology to 256Gb memory in 2015, and 512Gb in 2017.  Quad-level cell  Memory that stores four bits per cell are commonly referred to as Quad Level Cell (QLC), following the convention set by TLC. Prior to its invention, QLC referred to cells that can have sixteen voltage states, i.e. ones that store four bits per cell. In 2009, Toshiba and SanDisk introduced NAND flash memory chips with quad-level cells, storing 4-bit per cell and holding a capacity of 64Gb. SanDisk X4 flash memory cards, introduced in 2009, was one of the first products based on NAND-memory that stores four bits per cell, commonly referred to as Quad Level Cell (QLC), using 16 discrete charge levels (states) in each individual transistor. The QLC chips used in these memory cards were manufactured by Toshiba, SanDisk and SK Hynix.SanDisk Ships World’s First Flash Memory Cards with 64 Gigabit X4 (4-Bits-Per-Cell) NAND Flash TechnologyNAND Flash - The New Era of 4 bit per cell and Beyond EE Times 2009-05-05 In 2017, Toshiba introduced V-NAND memory chips with quad-level cells, which have a storage capacity of up to 768Gb.

He remains the second longest-serving U.S. Representative from Maine, the first being his colleague Thomas Brackett Reed. Early life Boutelle was born to Charles and Lucy A. (Curtis) Boutelle in Damariscotta, Lincoln County, Maine. In 1848 his family moved from Damariscotta to Brunswick, Maine. He attended the public schools of Brunswick and later attended the Yarmouth Academy in 1850 and 1851. Naval career His father was a shipmaster, and Charles himself went to sea at the age of fifteen. He spent the next eleven years as a sailor, becoming a shipmaster in his own right in 1860. Returning from a two-year voyage in 1862 to find the country at war, he volunteered his services to the Union Navy and was commissioned an Acting Master on April 5, 1862. He saw service on the , a double-ended, sidewheeling, steam gunboat assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. During this assignment, the shallow-draft vessel was engaged in intelligence-gathering, patrolling the river outlets, and guarding against Confederate river traffic attempting to run the blockade of the Georgia coastline. His next assignment was aboard , another double-ended, steam gunboat engaged in the blockades of Charleston and Wilmington. On May 5, 1864, while assigned to that vessel, his ship, along with other Union vessels, saw action against the Confederate ironclad . During that engagement, Sassacus rammed the Albemarle as it attempted to escape. Sassacus took a direct hit to the starboard boiler and sustained significant damage when the boiler exploded. It was during that battle that Boutelle was cited “for gallant conduct,” resulting in his promotion to the rank of Volunteer Lieutenant, the highest rank granted volunteer officers not of the regular navy. Lieutenant Boutelle was subsequently given command of the , another of the shallow-draft and lightly armored steam vessels known as 'tinclads'. During his command, Nyanza participated, under Admiral David Farragut, in the Battle of Mobile Bay, on August 5, 1864, where Lieutenant Boutelle was credited with receiving the surrender of the Confederate fleet. Following the victory at Mobile, Boutelle was placed in command of Union naval forces in the Mississippi Sound. Lieutenant Boutelle continued in naval service until the conclusion of the war when he voluntarily separated from service. He was granted an honorable discharge on January 14, 1866. Soon after his departure from naval service, he married Elizabeth (\\"Lizzie\\") Hodsdon, daughter of attorney and Maine Adjutant General, John L. Hodsdon, on May 16, 1866, in Augusta, the bride's home town.Maine Bride and Groom Card Indices, Maine State Archives. Together they had three daughters, Grace Hodsdon Boutelle, Elizabeth Boutelle, and Anne (\\"Annie\\") Curtis Boutelle. In 1890 Anne Boutelle sponsored the protected cruiser , the US Navy's first modern cruiser. Newspaper editor and publisher Following the war, Boutelle became the master of a steamer running between New York and Wilmington. He was associated briefly with a New York commission house, but, in 1870, he was recommended for the position of Editor- in-Chief of the Bangor Daily Whig and Courier, a Republican newspaper. He took that position and moved his young family to Bangor in their home state of Maine, where they lived for the rest of his life. Boutelle was a dynamic editor, and, under his leadership, the paper became one of the most influential in the northeastern United States. Upon the death of the owner, J. H. Lynde, Boutelle, along with a partner, B. A. Burr, purchased the Daily Whig and Courier on May 15, 1874. He continued active editorial control until failing health and growing competition finally forced him to sell the paper in March, 1900.The Press of Penobscot County, Maine. Hon. John E. Godfrey.

June 17–18, 1989. Political career Boutelle's robustly-conservative Republican editorial positions drew him further into both state and national politics. He was selected as a district delegate to the Republican National Convention at Cincinnati in 1876, and served as the president of the Maine (James G.) Blaine Club at the national convention of 1880. Gaining further prominence in the state Republican party, he was selected as the representative from Maine on the Republican National Committee at the national convention of 1884 that nominated James G. Blaine. He was both a delegate-at-large and chairman of the Maine delegation at the Republican national convention of 1888, during which he read to the convention the cablegram from Blaine refusing to be nominated. He was a member of the Maine Republican State Committee from 1875 to 1882. U.S. Representative An obvious choice for U.S. Congress, he first stood as the Republican candidate for the 4th Maine Congressional District (comprising Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis and Washington counties) on June 24, 1880, but was narrowly defeated (by 855 votes) by the incumbent, Dr. George W. Ladd of the Greenback Party. He was elected Maine representative-at- large to the 48th Congress by a substantial majority in the 1882 election, and he was subsequently elected 4th District Representative in every election after that, until his resignation in 1901.Congressional Directory of the 54th Congress (2nd Session). Pitman Pulsifer (ed.), Washington: Government Printing Office, 1896. Congressman Boutelle drew on his maritime background, serving as the Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee in the 51st, 54th, 55th, and 56th Congresses. During his tenure in that position, he provided powerful leadership in modernizing the navy and was instrumental in the development of the first steel battleships, along with the industries that supported their construction and outfitting. The growth of the Bath Iron Works can be partly attributed to his leadership position. No less charismatic a speaker than he was a writer, Congressman Boutelle was relentless in his support of Republican positions in the great debates of his time. He is especially remembered for speeches on the question of Hawaiian annexation (53rd Congress) and the border dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela (54th Congress); these were the two great foreign policy issues of the second Democratic administration of President Grover Cleveland (1892–1896). Illness and death Boutelle was at the peak of his political popularity when, on December 21, 1899, he suffered an apparent seizure during a stay in a Boston hotel; the seizure left him unconscious. He was treated briefly at his home in Bangor, but he was soon moved to the McLean Asylum in the Waverley section of Belmont, Massachusetts. Under the care of the superintendent, Dr. Edward Cowles, he was diagnosed with \\"brain trouble\\" arising from the seizure, as well as underlying renal and cardiac disease.New York Times, Sunday, December 15, 1900. Although he made slow progress toward recovery, he never again fully regained his faculties and remained hospitalized for the rest of his life. Despite this, however, the loyalty he commanded from the voters of his district, as well as the state party chiefs, was so great that he was again nominated, and elected, to the 57th Congress. In addition to his poor health, his last years were plagued with financial troubles. In response to his situation, as well as in tribute to his long service to the nation, the Maine Republican delegation led a joint resolution of Congress January 16, 1901, naming him to the Naval Retired List with the rank of Captain, entitling him to half-pay at that rank for life. He resigned from Congress on March 3, 1901, prior to the commencement of the 57th Congress.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress 1774-Present.

To qualify, a coach must have coached the club in at least one senior VFL/AFL match, defined as an Australian rules football match between two clubs that are, or were at the time of the match, members of the VFL/AFL. A senior VFL/AFL match is played under the laws of Australian football, and includes regular season matches, as well as finals series matches. It does not include pre-season competition matches, Night Series matches, interstate matches or international rules football matches.

The Right wing of Fatah Beyond the Bagdad-oriented Ba'ath Party-linked Arab Liberation Front (ALF), there were some high-ranking members of Fatah itself who were heavily influenced by the original/non-Marxist Pan-Arab doctrine of the Ba'ath. These people rejected the Soviet Union and Arab states close to it (The pro-Syrian Ba'ath, Algeria, Libya and South Yemen). They resented Yasser Arafat's rapprochement with Moscow and the PLO's progressive drift towards \\"third-worldist\\" leftwing rhetoric. They were viewed as the \\"conservative\\" rightwing of Fatah. Many were members of the Galilean/Northern Palestinian aristocracy (such as Khaled Yashruti's father, who was the hereditary Shaykh of the Shadhiliyya Sufi brotherhood in pre-1947 Palestine). Most had studied in the US or at the American University of Beirut in the late 1950s.  Involvement in the PLO  Khaled Yashruti progressively became their leader in the mid-1960s, and became a member of the PLO leadership in 1968, two years before Fatah's commanders were expelled to Lebanon from Jordan. Yashruti's faction had the backing of the Al-Bakr/Saddam Hussein Ba'athist government in Baghdad and was generally favorable to US involvement in the Middle-East as a counterweight to the growing influence of the USSR and Israel. In parallel to his political activities, Khaled worked as a civil engineer and real estate entrepreneur in Lebanon. He died in 1970 in an accident- a huge crane fell on him while he was inspecting construction works in downtown Beirut. Some Palestinian and Lebanese journalists argued this was not an accident, but murder.

The film was produced and directed by Connie Field and Marilyn Mulford. Participants interviewed include Bob Moses, Victoria Gray Adams, Endesha Ida Mae Holland, and Freedom Summer volunteers Marshall Ganz, Heather Booth, and Pam Allen. Freedom on My Mind premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, won that year's Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Synopsis In 1961, Mississippi was rigidly segregated. There were virtually no black voters even though African-Americans comprised a large percentage of the population, the majority in some localities. Bob Moses entered the state and the Mississippi Voter Registration Project began. The first black farmer who attempted to register was fatally shot by a Mississippi State Representative, E.H. Hurst. Due to intimidation of witnesses, one of whom, Louis Allen, was slain, Hurst was never prosecuted. Among the events depicted in the film is the Freedom Summer of 1964, in which three civil rights workers were slain. Freedom on My Mind combines personal interviews, rare archival film and television footage, authentic Mississippi Delta blues, and Movement gospel songs. It emphasizes the strategic brilliance of Mississippi's young, black organizers. Barred from political participation, they created their own integrated party the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. They recruited a thousand mostly white students from around the country to come to Mississippi, bringing the eyes and conscience of the nation with them. The students and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party organizers put together a delegation of sharecroppers, maids, and day-laborers that challenged the all-white delegates in the 1964 Democratic National Convention. The film describes how their effort to replace the state's delegation was not accepted by the Democratic Party leadership, embittering the activists. Ultimately their efforts succeeded. In 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, and by 1990, Mississippi had more elected black officials than any other state in the country. Reception Freedom on My Mind received favorable reviews and was named among the best films of the year by The San Francisco Examiner and The Oakland Tribune. Variety called it \\"a landmark documentary that chronicles the most tumultuous and significant years in the history of the civil rights movement. A must see.\\" It was broadcast on PBS's American Experience and internationally, and has been used educationally in colleges and universities around the world. The Washington Post said that the film \\"conveys the human dimensions of the fight with such a powerful combination of sensitivity and intelligence and pure emotional insight that it seems as if the facts were being set down for the very first time. As political history this is superlative stuff.\\" The San Francisco Examiner called it \\"a great success. It manages not only to record the inspiring experiences of the white volunteers and black pioneers of the voting rights drive, but also to place those experiences within a larger and more depressing story of power politics at the national level.\\" Critic John Petrakis, of The Chicago Tribune called the film \\"superbly produced and \\"must-viewing for anyone with an interest in the civil rights movement or American history.\\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-28/entertainment/9410280308_1_freedom- summer-blacks-courage  Awards  * Sundance Film Festival: Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary (1994) * Academy Awards: Nominated as Best Feature Documentary (1994) * winner, Erik Barnouw Award, Organization of American Historians (1995) * winner, John O'Connor Award, American Historical Association * winner, Distinguished Documentary Award, International Documentary Association (1994) * winner, CINE Golden Eagle (1996) See also *Civil rights movement in popular culture *Louis Allen *Voting Rights Act of 1965 References External links * *Clarity Films website *PBS American Experience Category:1994 films Category:American Experience Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about the civil rights movement ","title":"Freedom on My Mind"},{"id":"12401592","text":"The Coal-black Salamander (Bolitoglossa anthracina) is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae.

Signs and symptoms Cloacas appear in a wide spectrum of variation in females born with the malformation. The single orifice, called a common channel, may occur varying in length from 1 to 10 cm. The length of the common channel can be used to judge prognostic outcomes and technical challenges during surgical repair. A common channel less than 3 cm in length usually has good sphincter muscles and a well-developed sacrum. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a female with cloaca should be suspected in a female born with an imperforate anus and small looking genitalia. The diagnosis can be made clinically. Failure to identify a cloaca as being present in a newborn may be dangerous, as more than 90% have associated urological problems. The goal for treatment of a female born with cloaca is to achieve bowel control, urinary control, and sexual function, which includes menstruation, sexual intercourse, and possibly pregnancy. Cloacas probably occur in 1 in 20,000 live births... Treatment The prognostic outcomes for this type of cloaca are good for bowel control and urinary function. The surgical repair for this type of cloaca can usually be done by performing posterior sagittal approach without opening of the abdomen. A common channel longer than 3 cm in length usually has poor sphincter muscles and a poor sacrum, suggesting a prognostic outcome for bowel control and urinary function to be less likely. Common channels longer than 3 cm are generally considered more complex and more technically challenging in surgical repair.

Constructed by the community's namesake founder, it has been greatly modified by later owners, and it has been named a historic site. The Connecticut Land Company was formed in the late eighteenth century to settle and develop the section of western Connecticut that later became the Connecticut Western Reserve region of Ohio. Eliphalet Austin joined the company and purchased wide tracts of land throughout the region, including present-day Austinburg Township, which bears his name. He settled at present- day Austinburg in 1799 and, according to local tradition, arranged for the construction of the present house in 1811. As northeastern Ohio developed, he became regionally prominent: his land holdings were located in multiple counties, he was responsible for carrying the mails, he operated a cattle- dealing operation, and he was a state senator from 1829 to 1831. Austin's descendants inherited his property after his death.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 26. Austin's house is a brick structure in the Italianate style. Its appearance is radically different from that of its earliest years; it appears that the present appearance was the result of an extensive remodelling project conducted under the auspices of Austin's grandson Louis B. Austin during the 1860s. Precise documentation of the remodelling is not extant, but numerous details are typical of the 1860s, and no extant building anywhere in the United States is known to have employed the Italianate style before 1844.Sheridan, Ellen M., and Marlene H. Lentz. '. National Park Service, 1987-12-15, 3. In 1975, Austin's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying for inclusion both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place as the home of a regionally significant man. It is one of three National Register-listed properties in Austinburg Township, along with the nearby Congregational Church of Austinburg and the L.W. Peck House in the community of Eagleville.

It includes early examples of comédies en vaudevilles. The comédie en vaudevilles () was a theatrical entertainment which began in Paris towards the end of the 17th century, in which comedy was enlivened through lyrics using the melody of popular vaudeville songs.Barnes 2001. Evolution The annual fairs of Paris at St. Germain and St. Laurent had developed theatrical variety entertainments, with mixed plays, acrobatic displays, and pantomimes, typically featuring vaudevilles (see Théâtre de la foire). Gradually these features began to invade established theatres. The Querelle des Bouffons (War of the Clowns), a dispute amongst theatrical factions in Paris in the 1750s, in part reflects the rivalry of this form, as it evolved into opéra comique, with the Italian opera buffa. Comédie en vaudevilles also seems to have influenced the English ballad opera and the German Singspiel. Vaudeville final One feature of the comédie en vaudevilles which later found its way into opera was the vaudeville final, a strophic finale in which the characters assemble at the end of the piece with each singing a short verse, often ending with a refrain which everyone would sing, and a final verse with the entire ensemble joining in. Typically the first verse provides the moral of the story, while the intervening verses comment on particular events in the plot, and the final verse appeals directly to audience for its indulgence.Bartlet 1992. Sometimes the verses were also interspersed with dances. It became a common feature of the earlier opéras comiques, such as those written by Charles Simon Favart or composed by Egidio Duni, Pierre- Alexandre Monsigny, and François-André Danican Philidor, and began to frequently utilize new music, although still labelled \\"vaudeville\\". The vaudeville final was almost never used in works presented at the Comédie- Française or the Académie Royale de Musique, and the exceptions are comedies, an example at the former being Pierre Beaumarchais's play Le mariage de Figaro (1784), which ends with a vaudeville, and at the latter, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Le devin du village (1752), which has a vaudeville final. Although it fell out of style at the Comédie-Italienne around the time of the French Revolution, the tradition was carried into the early 19th century at the popular theatres on the Boulevard du Temple, and elsewhere in Paris, in particular at the Théâtre du Vaudeville. The style can be discerned in many operas, although with newly composed music, including Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice (1762), Haydn's Orlando paladino (1782), and Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782), Der Schauspieldirektor (1786),Oxford Dictionary 1992. and Don Giovanni (1788), as well as later works, such as Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia (1816), Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury (1875), Verdi's Falstaff (1893), Ravel's L'heure espagnole (1911) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (1951).

It is managed by the Austintown Historical Society and commonly known as the \\"Austin Log Cabin\\".http://austintownhistoricalsociety.com/index.php  Historic uses  Discovery of the Cabin In 1973, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, in Austintown Township, Ohio, bought an abandoned house adjacent to the church property. In the process of tearing down the house, log-like beams were discovered. Demolition stopped. Volunteers removed the artificial brick and siding from the structure revealing a two-story log cabin. The steeple notch on the corner logs indicated that the cabin has been built prior to 1824. A deed search was undertaken. This title search revealed that Calvin Austin sold to John Packard on April 29, 1814 for $500.00. Further research indicated that Austintown Township, Ohio was named for Calvin Austin who was a land agent for the Connecticut Land Company. It was obvious that this priceless treasure must be preserved. Residents of the Cabin The earliest residents of the house were John Harris Packard (listed as one 108 resident heads of household in Austintown in 1820 census) and his second wife, Mary Alfred (or Alford) Barnes Packard. John Harris Packard was born January 30, 1748 in North Bridgewater, Mass.. He and his second wife, Mary, and their 10 children migrated to Austintown in 1814. Upon John's death on January 7, 1827 in Austintown (listed as Miander Township on his will which is included below) Ohio, the log house and surrounding were willed to his son, William Packard. On January 14, 1828, deed records indicate a transfer of from William and Martha Packard to Samuel Dorwat (Dorworth) for $150. Records indicate that in 1829, Dorwat and his wife, Sarah \\"Ann\\" Burgett Dorwat, sold including the house to Henry Lawrence (alternately spelled Lorins) and his wife Polly for $50. In 1845, these were sold to Abraham Dustman and his wife, Rebecca Mauer Dustman, for $406. The Dustmans lived there with their five children. Dustman was a farmer and is thought to have built the barn that was destroyed in a fire in 1910. In 1850, Dustman sold the property to Henry Wehr and his wife Margaret for $510. Wehr dug the wells and added the hog shed. At some point, Henry sold the property to his nephew, Levi Wehr. In the \\"Archeology of Log Cabin,\\" Dr. John White describes Levi as “a heavy and secretive drinker” because White found at least 183 whiskey bottles secreted in the foundation of the second barn built by Levi in 1910. Levi and his wife, Emma, raised two daughters in the house. The house was owned in the 1940s by Willard Wesley Stricklin. Stricklin is reported to have dug out the root cellar below the kitchen. The house was occupied from 1948 to 1963 by Joseph Hanko. Hanko dug out cellar under main house and added the small bathroom extension. The house sat vacant from 1964 until 1973 when it was acquired by St. Andrew's Episcopal Church. Preservation of the Cabin The Austintown Community Council worked with members of the community to raise funds for the restoration of the cabin. With the approval of township officials, the group developed an innovative fundraiser which involved standing at the busiest intersection in Austintown and collecting money from drivers in cars stopped at the red light. This, coupled with pennies collected from school children; donations from school PTAs, civic organization, and various church groups; bake sales, book sales, and a flea market yielded $50,000 with which to restore the cabin. While some volunteers were fundraising, other volunteers, under the guidance of an architect knowledgeable in historical preservation, were removing the cabin's roof and replacing it with a wood shake roof, removing interior walls, replacing windows with panes of glass from a 100-year-old school house, and adding a furnace and new plumbing. They sealed the logs with preservatives, and they replaced the chinking with a cement mixture to simulate the original the clay, straw, mud and rock chinking. They restored the fireplace using century-old brick and an old barn beam for the mantel. As a result of their efforts, the Austin Log Cabin was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. A $2,500 grant from the Ohio American Revolution Bicentennial Commission allowed the dedication of the Austin Log Cabin on July 4, 1976 as Austintown's Bicentennial Project. The Austintown Historical Society was formed on July 21, 1976 for the purpose of maintaining the Austin Log Cabin. It became a 501(c)(3) in 1976 and was incorporated in 1979. The Cabin Today The Austintown Historical Society continues to maintain the Austin Log Cabin and is responsible for the upkeep, utilities, and day-to-day maintenance. It has furnished the Austin Log Cabin through donations of period furnishing including a bed slept in by Frank Ohl, a historical figure in Austintown, a spinning wheel, yarn winder, two primitive tables, and Ohio Bicentennial memorabilia. One room of the Cabin is dedicated to the Bicentennial of the United States and memorabilia of that era. Another upstairs room of the Cabin is outfitted as a one-room school house replete with documents and photos of Austintown's 12 one-room school houses, a coal stove, desks, period books, and yearbooks from Austintown Fitch High School dating from 1917 to the present day. The basement is furnished with antique farm implements. A corn crib, a three-seat outhouse, a smokehouse, various farming implements, and a coal car from one of Austintown's earliest coal mines are located outside. The Austin Log Cabin has served as the site for an Archaeological Dig supervised by the late Dr. John White, professor emeritus of anthropology at Youngstown State University. In addition to the cabin, Dr. White's dig revealed the existence of a multipurpose shed which was at one time used as a chicken coop, a stock well dug in 1860-70 and abandoned by 1930, a chicken house, two outdoor privies—one dug in 1950 and one right before 1950, a barn, a second barn built circa 1910, a hog shed, a house well, a cistern, and a summer house. Relics collected during these digs are displayed throughout the Cabin as is the book, Archaeology of the Log House, produced by Dr. White.

His only other writing credit with the band was on the title track of the preceding album, A Song for All Seasons. A pre-release track listing, published in the Renaissance Appreciation Society newsletter, included the song \\"Island of Avalon\\". This song ended up being omitted from the album; the band members weren't sufficiently pleased with it, having not invested their usual amount of time in it. It was ultimately used as the non-album B-side to \\"The Winter Tree\\" in April 1979;The History Of Renaissance it was the only such B-side of the Haslam era of the band. It was released on CD in 1997 on the compilation Songs from Renaissance Days. Following this album's release, Renaissance underwent major changes that left it with a very uncertain future. In 1980, following a short tour of Israel, both John Tout and Terry Sullivan left the band. Tout (who was dealing with some personal stress due to the death of his sister) had made a major mistake during a concert and walked offstage. After this it was mutually decided that he should leave the band. Terry Sullivan, a longtime friend of Tout's, then left the band as well on principle.

Description and history The house was built in 1855 and reflects the Greek Revival architectural style. The large two-story brick house sits on a spacious lot slightly elevated from street level. The isolated site has few structures nearby. The first home of Carlos Avery is to the north and the remnants of a bridge that spanned the Black River. Sitting above the roadway at a curve the house is a prominent feature in the area. The wooded banks of the river behind the house create a picturesque scene. The foundation is cut sandstone with the top course projecting to form a water table. The walls of locally made brick are not laid in discernable bond pattern. The main mass is rectangular with a gable end facade, a smaller longer wing is attached on the south side has a porch on the west (front). The entry is set to the south of the facade of the main section. The door is flanked by sidelights and has a transom. Simple stone lintels and sills surround the door and six-over-six double-hung sashes of the facade of this section. Two windows are beside the door to the north and above are three symmetrically arranged over the first floor fenestration. An unusual feature of this section is a broad entablature that projects from the plane of the wall and is painted white. The gable ends have full triangular pediments and broad rectangular attic windows. The smaller wing recalls this with a white frieze featuring long rectangular fenestration. An additional wing apparently built at the same time as the house extends into the space between the two main sections in the rear. The door opens into a large central hallway on the south of the main section with an open stairway leading to a similar hallway on the second floor. To the right of the stairs is a large open parlor with massive Greek Revival woodwork including triangular pediments above the doors and windows. The south section contains a dining room with fireplace and a kitchen with large fireplace. An unusual curved wall creates a pantry at the rear of this space. This section includes a number of small purposed rooms including an area for spinning flax. The second floor of the main section has three large bedrooms with woodwork like that below except that it is raked along the sides. A basement with a summer kitchen a fireplace for cooking. The Carlos Avery House is historically significant as a fine example of domestic rural Greek Revival architecture distinguished by its size and details.

It flies C-130H Hercules aircraft on airlift and aerial spray missions. The wing maintain the DoD’s only large area fixed-wing aerial spray capability to control disease-carrying insects, pest insects, undesirable vegetation and to disperse oil spills in large bodies of water using six C-130H aircraft equipped with the Modular Aerial Spray System (MASS). Overview The 910th Airlift Wing is a United States Air Force Reserve Command unit located at Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio. It is under the command of Twenty-Second Air Force of Air Force Reserve Command at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. In the event of mobilization, the unit would be assigned to the Air Mobility Command, headquartered at Scott AFB, IL. The 910th Airlift Wing's mission statement is \\"Combat ready NOW...for tomorrow's fight\\". In wartime, the 910th Airlift Wing mission is to employ the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in combat operations of tactical airlift. These operations include low-level infiltration into a combat environment, where aircrews can deliver personnel and materials by airdrop and air-land techniques. The 910th Airlift Wing is composed of three groups and one medical unit, the 910th Medical Squadron. The 910th Operations Group is composed of one flying squadron and one support unit, the 910th Operations Support Squadron. The flying squadron is the 757th Airlift Squadron, which includes the only large-area, fixed-wing aerial spray mission in the Department of Defense. The 910th Maintenance Group is assigned two squadrons, the 910th Maintenance Squadron and the 910th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. The 910th Mission Support Group is assigned seven units: the 910th Mission Support Flight, 910th Civil Engineer Squadron, 910th Security Forces Squadron, 910th Force Support Squadron, 910th Logistics Readiness Squadron, 76th Aerial Port Squadron and 910th Communications Squadron.

The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. Continental Air Command (ConAC)'s plan called for placing Air Force Reserve units at fifty-nine installations located throughout the United States. When these relocations were completed in 1959, reserve wing headquarters and wing support elements would typically be on one base, along with one (or in some cases two) of the wing's flying squadrons, while the remaining flying squadrons were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 Although this dispersal was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis, with the units being released on 22 November 1962. The formation of troop carrier groups occurred in January 1963 for units that had not been mobilized, but was delayed until February for those that had been.Cantwell, pp. 189-191 Activation of 910th Troop Carrier Group As a result, the 910th Troop Carrier Group was established at Youngstown Air Reserve Station, Ohio on 17 January 1963, as the headquarters for the 757th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since November 1957.Maurer, pp. 739-740 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 757th. The group's mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars for Tactical Air Command airlift operations. The 910th was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 459th Troop Carrier Wing in 1963, the others being the 909th Troop Carrier Group at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, and the 911th Troop Carrier Group at Pittsburgh International Airport, Pennsylvania. The 910th participated in tactical exercises, airlift operations, and joint operations with Army airborne forces in U.S. and overseas, 1963-1969. The group trained as a forward air control unit, 1970–1971; as a special operations group, 1971–1973; and as a fighter group, 1973-1981. It converted again to an airlift mission in 1981 and received its first C-130 aircraft on 27 March 1981. The 910th periodically deployed to Panama to support Air Force missions in Central and South America, beginning in 1983. It has trained to airdrop and airland personnel and materiel and added the only full-time, fixed-wing aerial spray in the Department of Defense in January 1992. It has deployed personnel and equipment worldwide to support contingency operations, exercises, and humanitarian missions. In May 1995, the 910th Airlift Group was re-designated the 910th Airlift Wing, with 16 permanently assigned and authorized aircraft. Youngstown Air Reserve Station was also named as the site for a regional maintenance facility. November 2003, the 910th transferred four C-130 aircraft to the 934th Airlift Wing at Minneapolis-St Paul Air Reserve Station. The transfer left the 910th with 12 permanently assigned C-130H2 aircraft. The unit was tasked from September to October 2005 to combat the potential deadly spread of infectious diseases from insect bites due to the flooding in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in late August and in September 2005. When the mission concluded, the 910th helped the people of Louisiana and Texas by spraying more than 2.8 million acres. This equates to 4,501 square miles, or approximately an area the size of Connecticut. This was the largest aerial spray tasking since the mission's conception in 1973. From May to June 2003, The 910th's 757th Airlift Squadron conducted aerial spray for Operation Deep Water Horizon. The aerial spray mission used dispersing agents to neutralize the oil spill caused by the April 2010 sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. This mission marked the first real world application of oil spill dispersants by the 910th. From November 2011 to March 2014, Air Force structure changes reduced the 910th's Primary Assigned Aircraft from 12 to eight, with one Back-up Inventory Aircraft. The reduction in aircraft resulted in the inactivation of the 773d Airlift Squadron, which was activated as a unit of the 910th in 1995. From June 2014 to Sept. 2014, more than 110 members from the 910th Airlift Wing's flying and maintenance squadrons supported airlift operations to various military installations throughout the U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) Area of Operations. During their deployment, the 910th service members and aircraft completed 1,275 flying hours during the course of 300 missions. During these missions, the aircrews moved 4,311 passengers, hauled 1813 tons of cargo and transported 36 patients for a mission effectiveness rate of 100%.

His wife sent him to jail, once, allegating he had no religion and that he didn't have respect for divine and human laws. Ten days later she changed her mind, telling others that he was an honest man with spirit. As a person, he was a beloved to many, a good husband and a good friend. He liked both pleasure and science.

She was the wife of the prominent Greek Herodes Atticus.Birley, The Roman government of Britain, p. 112 Genealogy Regilla was born into an aristocratic family of consular rank. She was a member of the gens Annia, of the venerable branch of the Annii Regilli.Pomeroy, The murder of Regilla, p. 14 Regilli means \\"Little Kings\\".

The paternal grandparents of Regilla were the senator Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus and his unnamed wife, while her maternal grandparents of Regilla was the Roman Senator, Governor Marcus Appius Bradua, and the aristocratic woman Caucidia Tertulla.Birley, The Roman government of Britain, p. 112-114 Her mother's brother was Marcus Atilius Metilius Bradua Caucidius Tertullus...Bassus.Pomeroy, The murder of Regilla, p.15Birley, The Roman government of Britain p. 113-114 Her uncle served as a polyonymous Proconsul of the Africa Province under the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161). Her grandfathers were consular colleagues for the year 108. Through her paternal grandfather, Regilla was related to the Roman Senator Marcus Annius Verus, who was a brother-in-law of Roman Emperor Hadrian and father of the Roman Empress Faustina the Elder, wife of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius. Faustina the Elder was the mother of Roman Empress Faustina the Younger and aunt of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Regilla was related to the Roman Empress Lucilla, Roman Emperor Commodus, and 3rd-century Roman Empress Annia Faustina. Marriage and early life with Herodes Atticus During her father's consulship, her father had betrothed Regilla to the prominent Greek Herodes Atticus.Pomeroy, The murder of Regilla, p.23 Herodes Atticus was a very wealthy, influential, aristocratic Athenian who was a friend to the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and was a tutor to the Emperor's adopted son Marcus Aurelius. Herodes Atticus and Regilla married in 139. Regilla was about 14 years old and Herodes Atticus was 40 years old. When Regilla married Herodes Atticus, Annius Gallus gave his daughter a dowry. With this dowry Regilla bought with her husband a villa on the third mile of the Appian Way just south of Rome and together they controlled a large area of land, which was known as the \\"Triopio\\" (from Triopas, King of Thessaly), and later, in medieval times, as Capo di Bove. Regilla and Herodes Atticus only lived in Italy for a while. In a few years after their marriage, Herodes Atticus, Regilla and their children left Italy and moved to Greece. Although she was directly cut off from her immediate influential family, relatives and friends in Italy, Regilla became a part of the highest Greek circle of society, in particular in Athens. Greece and Olympia Regilla spent her remaining years living and travelling around Greece. When she lived in Athens, she was awarded as a priestess of the goddess Tyche and the venerable, long-established office of priestess of Demeter Chamyne in Olympia, Greece in 153. As a priestess of Demeter Chamyne, Regilla was the only woman officially present at the Olympic Games. Regilla sat on or near the altar of Demeter Chamyne on the north side of the stadium in Olympia opposite on the stand of the judges to view the competitions. Being a priestess serving Demeter Chamyne, was a great honor and was quite physically demanding. Using her own considerable influence and wealth, Regilla erected a great nymphaeum (a monumental fountain) at Olympia. Her husband constructed an aqueduct that fed the nymphaeum. The fountain that Regilla built made the cool refreshing water available to the people in this hot, dusty area. In the centre of the nymphaeum stood a life-sized statue of a bull. On that bull there is an honorific inscription dedicated to Regilla stating: “Regilla, priestess of Demeter, dedicated the water and the things around the water to Zeus”. At Olympia, bulls were sacrificed at the Temple of Zeus, the chief divinity of Olympia. The nymphaeum of Herodes Atticus and Regilla in Olympia, Greece The fountain that Regilla built had two levels of niches bearing statues and a columnar façade. Statues have survived from the monument. The central niche on each level held a statue of Zeus, surrounding by portrait statues on each side. The lower level contained the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and the ancestors and descendants of the emperor. These included the previous Roman emperor Hadrian; Hadrian's cousin-wife Vibia Sabina; the Roman empress Faustina the Elder; the daughter of the elder Faustina and Antoninus Pius, Faustina the Younger; and Antoninus Pius’ adopted son and son-in-law, the future Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. This level also showed several children of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger, in particular their first daughter Annia Galeria Aurelia Faustina (aged about 7 but shown as a young adolescent). On the upper level, paralleling the imperial family, were statues of Regilla, Herodes Atticus, Regilla's parents, Regilla's maternal grandfather and Herodes Atticus’ parents. There were four statues of the children of Regilla and Herodes Atticus, named Elpinice, Athenais, Atticus Bradua and Regillus. The life-sized statue of the bull and the statues from the fountain are on display at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia. Regilla is depicted in a traditional garment and pose that was suited for noble women, elite matrons and empresses. Due to the fountain's height and gleaming marble, the monument stood out among the surrounding buildings. This fountain brought great honor to Regilla and her family, in particular in emphasizing their links and relations to the ruling imperial family in Rome. It is not known for certain how her contemporaries and peers viewed Regilla and her magnificent donation to Olympia. In the year that Regilla's brother was consul, Regilla was kicked to death in the abdomen by a freedman of Herodes Atticus named Alcimedon. Appius Annius Atilius Bradua brought charges in Rome against his brother-in-law, alleging that Herodes Atticus had been responsible for her death; Marcus Aurelius had exonerated his old tutor. Posthumous honors and legacy After Regilla died, Herodes Atticus was stricken with grief. Herodes Atticus made various dedications to the memory of his wife. He offered Regilla's jewels to the goddesses Ceres and Proserpina. The building that is believed to be her tomb, known as the Temple of Rediculum, was built in the grounds of the villa she owned with Herodes Atticus, in what is now the Caffarella Park close to the Appian Way; the building is still well-preserved. Atticus also had raised on the boundary line of the property two columns bearing this inscription in Greek and Latin: : “To the memory of Annia Regilla, wife of Herodes, the light and soul of the house, to whom these lands once belonged”. The Odeon of Herodes Atticus built in memory of his wife at the Acropolis in Athens In an agricultural village located in the Datça Peninsula, a temple was dedicated to Faustina the Younger under the title of the New Ceres, a burial place for the family was placed under the protection of Minerva and Nemesis, and lastly a grove was consecrated to the memory of Regilla. In 161, Herodes Atticus erected a monument in Athens called the Odeon to honor her memory. From the 2nd century to the present day, Regilla and Herodes Atticus have continued to be considered as great benefactors in Greece, in particular in Athens. Two streets in Athens are named after them—Herodou Attikou Street and Rēgíllēs Street—as is a Square in downtown Athens. The residence of the Prime Minister of Greece is on Rēgíllēs Street, while the Prime Minister's official seat is 19 Herodou Attikou Street. Regilla and Herodes Atticus also have streets named after them in Rome; these are located in the Quarto Miglio suburb close to the area of the Triopio. Children Regilla bore Herodes Atticus six children; three survived to adulthood. Their children were: * Son, Claudius – born and died in 141 * Daughter, Elpinice – born as Appia Annia Claudia Atilia Regilla Elpinice Agrippina Atria Polla, 142-165 * Daughter, Athenais – born as Marcia Annia Claudia Alcia Athenais Gavidia Latiaria, 143-161 * Son, Atticus Bradua – born as Tiberius Claudius Marcus Appius Atilius Bradua Regillus Atticus, born 145 * Son, Regillus – born as Tiberius Claudius Herodes Lucius Vibullius Regillus, 150-155 * Unnamed child who died with Regilla or died even perhaps three months later in 160  Gallery  file:Piranesi-16065.jpgThe tomb in an engraving by Piranesi file:The British Library - Rome - Cenotafio di Annia Regilla.jpgPrint in the British Library with the view of the tomb titled \\"Tempio del Dio Ridicolo\\" (Temple of the Ridiculous God) file:Tomb of Annia Regilla.jpgRoad leading to the tomb in the Caffarella Park file:Tomb of Annia Regilla1.JPGAnother view of the tomb file:TombAnniaRegillaCaffarella (3).JPGClose-up view of the front of the tomb file:TombAnniaRegillaCaffarella.JPGView of the rear of the tomb file:TombAnniaRegillaCaffarellaDetail.JPGArchitectural detail of the tomb References Sources * * Accessible on William P.

The sources of the nicknames included club names, team colors, and city symbols. The nicknames have sometimes been dubbed by the media, other times through conscious advertising marketing by the team, or sometimes a little of both. Most sources today, including such authoritative references as The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball, The Baseball Encyclopedia, Total Baseball, baseballreference.com, the Library of Congress and even the Baseball Hall of Fame itselfIn its exhibits and catalog; player plaques only list the city and league, not any team nickname usually adhere to an artificial naming convention, dating from 1951, which conforms references to 19th-century teams to modern usage (City + Plural Nickname), and which is misleadingly anachronistic: few teams before 1900 had names, and adopting them only really caught on in the first decades of the 20th century. Team nicknames like the \\"Boston Beaneaters\\" and \\"Brooklyn Bridegrooms\\" were never official; they were the invention of inventive sportswriters. A few of these coinages actually did catch hold with the contemporary fan base, such as \\"Robins\\" and \\"Browns,\\" and some remained popular long enough to be adopted officially, like \\"Giants\\" and \\"Pirates;\\" but many of the others were either ephemeral quips, like \\"Rustlers\\" and \\"Ruby Legs,\\" or never existed at all, like \\"Pilgrims.\\" Overview See also Team names and colors Athletic teams have long used colors and nicknames as a form of team identity. This echoes the use of colors and nicknames in other activities such as heraldry, the military, and the flags of states, provinces and nations. Baseball teams began to use nicknames early in the development of the sport. Not all teams felt the need for a nickname. The supposed first recorded game of baseball took place between two teams called \\"New York\\" and \\"Knickerbocker\\", in the mid-1840s. Both teams were actually based in New York City. After the American Civil War (1861-1865), interest in highly skilled games of baseball resulted in many hundreds of local organized clubs springing up, many under the umbrella of the new National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) from 1857–1870, also sometimes referred to as \\"the amateur association\\". These were often with names that were the club's official name, now often erroneously retrofitted as the \\"nickname\\". However, all of these club names had the words \\"Base Ball Club\\" listed after them (\\"baseball\\" was usually spelled then as two words). Examples: New York *Knickerbocker B.B.C. *Mutual B.B.C. Brooklyn *Atlantic B.B.C. *Eckford B.B.C. Philadelphia *Athletic B.B.C. *Olympic B.B.C. Cleveland *Forest City B.B.C. Although many of the players on these clubs were de facto professionals, the first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati \\"Red Stockings\\", an amateur team that turned professional and began a successful barnstorming tour in 1869. The fame of this team spelled the end of the high- level amateur version of the game. It was followed by a second \\"National Association\\", that of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) during 1871–1875, with an increasing number of local clubs and for the first time, professional franchise teams. The Cincinnati Red Stockings team's newfangled uniform of knee-length \\"knickers\\" with bright colored high-topped socks or stockings also inspired the use of team colors serving a dual role as a team nickname for the sportswriters of the day, who could add variety to their prose by referring to, e.g., the Hartford club or \\"Hartfords\\" alternately as the \\"Dark Blues\\" based on their obvious characteristic clothing. None of these early 'color' nicknames were official or used by the teams themselves, however. According to the Association and then the League, the teams were simply e.g. the \\"Brooklyn B. B. C.\\" Examples: *Boston: Red Stockings/Red Sox and Red Caps *Chicago: White Stockings/White Sox *Cincinnati: Red Stockings/Reds *Hartford: Dark Blues/Blues *Louisville: Grays *Mutual: Green Stockings *St. Louis: Brown Stockings/Browns and Red Stockings/Reds Suggesting an awareness of the significance of colors, seven seasons after its 1876 founding, the following National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known simply as the National League) in 1882 passed a rule requiring specific stocking colors for each team:Frank G. Menke, The Encyclopedia of Sports, A.S. Barnes & Company, 1955, p. 30 *Boston: Red *Buffalo: Gray *Chicago: White *Cleveland: Navy blue *Detroit: Old Gold *Providence: Light Blue *Troy: Green *Worcester: Brown While the 1882 rules prescribed stocking colors according to club, they also prescribed jersey and cap colors, but according to player position rather than according to club. Thus, on a single player's uniform, his cap and jersey would designate his position, and only his stockings would designate his club. As the news and developing sports media (primarily newspapers) began covering games extensively and assigning specialists to write about them, the inventive scribes might use the established names, or they might invent some new ones. Initially, they often referred to a club in the plural form, either by its city name or by its club name. Examples: *Athletics *Bostons *Chicagos *Mutuals As the writers and reporters became more inventive, they began to refer to teams by some characteristic that made the team or the city unique. Examples: *Beaneaters (Boston) *Colts (Chicago) *Giants (New York) *Spiders (Cleveland) *Trolley Dodgers (Brooklyn) When two or more major leagues existed simultaneously in one city, the writers often appended the league name, which occasionally had the chance of evolving also into a team nickname, especially in the then frequent cities of the Northeast with two teams, a representative in each league. (The Encyclopedia of Sports, p. 32) Examples: *Baltimore Americans (later \\"Orioles\\" - also used by previous NL and AA franchises) *Boston Nationals (later \\"Braves\\"), Boston Americans (later \\"Red Sox\\") *New York Nationals (better known as \\"Giants\\"), New York Americans or \\"Highlanders\\" (evolved into \\"Yankees\\") In some cases, such as the Cleveland Indians, the team actually solicited help from the media in inventing a new nickname. Some of those nicknames changed over time or died with the team, while some are still in use today. All of the nicknames of the \\"classic 8\\" NL teams of 1900-1952 were originally unofficial. But once an unofficial nickname became popular enough, it might be adopted by the team and become official. This practice was already coming into vogue by 1901 and the formation of the American League; four of the upstart league's eight franchises had official team names right from the start.Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Athletics. A couple of teams stuck with a name for several years and then changed it to something else, such as the Cleveland Napoleons > Indians, but most teams have never changed their names once officially adopted (other than teams which relocated to a new city). Some teams have had \\"two\\" popular nicknames simultaneously for many years. Examples: *Brooklyn Dodgers/Robins *Washington Senators/NationalsIn this case, the unofficial \\"Senators\\" monicker was far more popular than the official \\"Nationals,\\" which almost nobody used. The team finally gave up in 1956 and made it official. In the modern era of sports franchise expansion, nicknames are no longer assigned in a haphazard way by the news media, but rather are chosen by the teams for marketing and advertising purposes. The names are chosen in order to establish a strong team identity, and to have an attractive logo to encourage sales of merchandise to fans, such as caps and shirts. Often the nickname will have some sort of historical, geographical, cultural or economic symbolic connection or representation of the city and more recently, the surrounding state. Nonetheless, fans and media sportswriters may still apply informal tags in the old manner, such as the \\"Redbirds\\" (St Louis Cardinals) \\"Birds\\" or the \\"O's\\" (Baltimore Orioles) \\"Bronx Bombers\\" (New York Yankees) \\"Friars\\" (San Diego Padres) \\"Halos\\" (Los Angeles Angels) \\"Tribe\\" (Cleveland Indians). Atlanta For years the minor league team in Atlanta was called the Crackers. Atlanta Braves The Braves nickname originated in Boston in 1912. (See the Boston, Massachusetts, entry below.) The Braves moved from Boston to Milwaukee before the 1953 season and were known as the Milwaukee Braves from 1953 to 1965. The team moved again to Atlanta before the 1966 season, and have been known as the Atlanta Braves since. Baltimore Baltimore Orioles Earliest official adoption: 1901 The team's nickname is taken from the Baltimore oriole (Icterus galbula), a small blackbird of the passerine family of fowl in the eastern United States. The bird received its name in about 1808 from the fact that the male's colors resembled those on the coat of arms of Sir George Calvert (1579-1632), the first Lord Baltimore, who was senior of the Calvert family that established the Province of Maryland colony in the 17th century. The Baltimore oriole is also the state bird symbol of modern Maryland. Most of the professional baseball (and a few other sports) teams in Baltimore have been dubbed the \\"Orioles\\", with a few exceptions. The earliest Baltimore clubs, in the early 1870s, were called \\"Lord Baltimore\\" and \\"Maryland\\" respectively. These clubs were short-lived. The \\"Lord Baltimore\\" team chose the unusual team color of yellow or a variation of gold, and was often called the Canaries or the Yellow Stockings. The Maryland club was simply called the \\"Marylands\\", in the pluralized style of the day. The names and colors were also used by other local jurisdictions and schools/colleges/universities. The first club to be called the Baltimore Orioles was a charter member of the old American Association in 1882. When the AA league folded after the 1891 season, four of its teams were brought into the expanded National League (organized previously 1876), including Baltimore. This club became a dominant team in the older league during the 1890s under player-manager Ned Hanlon, in part because of their innovations and their tough, relentless play. The nickname \\"Orioles\\" first appears in the Spalding Guide in the 1895 edition which covered their first championship season, 1894; notably, the previous year's Guide never used the name at all. The term \\"Old Oriole\\" is sometimes used to describe a player whose aggressive style fits the legacy of those 1890s teams. The competitive famous team's fortunes took a downturn in 1899 when many of its stars were transferred to the Brooklyn Superbas/Dodgers, and Baltimore was one of the four teams contracted out of existence in 1900 when the NL reduced from 12 franchises to just 8, an arrangement lasting for over a half century. The newly formed American League of 1901 wanted to compete directly with the National League's New York Giants, but the Giants used their political clout to block the American League from placing a club there. Instead, one of its 8 charter member franchise teams was placed in Baltimore in 1901. Their \\"Orioles\\" nickname was acknowledged in an unusual way that year, with an orange letter \\"O\\" on their uniform shirts, probably the only major league team ever to sport a symbol that looked like a \\"zero\\". The 1902 shirts substituted a more conventional block letter B. In 1903, after the American and National leagues settled their 2 year old \\"baseball war\\" dispute with a \\"peace pact\\", the National League allowed the American league to have a competing New York club in the nation's largest city and the Baltimore club, which was originally meant to have been located in New York from the beginning was bought by former player/manager, the legendary John McGraw and transferred to New York City abandoning the Orioles name and, since 1913, known as the New York Yankees. A top-level minor league version of the Baltimore Orioles replaced the departed major league club, and it would be a force to be reckoned with in the \\"Triple AAA\\" high minors for 50 years, winning a number of International League championships and also providing a famed local boy, George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth to the major leagues in 1914. Another Baltimore team was the rival third-party Federal League entry of 1914–1915, which called itself the Baltimore Terrapins, after the diamondback terrapin, the state reptile of Maryland now primarily associated with the University of Maryland, College Park Maryland Terrapins sports teams. The Federal League Terrapins opened Terrapin Park across the street from the IL minor league and previous AL club's own ballpark, which was acquired by the Orioles after the \\"Fed\\" folded. That began a chain of events which led to Baltimore's return to major league status, a story covered in more detail in the article on Memorial Stadium. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns of the AL, another of the charter \\"original 8\\", moved to Baltimore, and the team adopted the city's old traditional baseball nickname. Many fans, and the team itself, also refer to the team as the \\"O's\\" or the \\"Birds\\". Boston \\"Neither team had a nickname [in 1901], nor would they for several more seasons. Both were simply called 'the Bostons,' although to differentiate between the two clubs, fans, sportswriters, and players commonly began referring to the NL entry as 'the Nationals,' and their American League counterparts as 'the Americans.' Other nicknames, such as the Pilgrims, Puritans, Plymouth Rocks, Somersets (so named after owner Charles Somers), or Collinsmen (after manager Collins) for the AL team and the Beaneaters, Triumvirs, or Seleemen (after manager Frank Selee) for the Nationals, were convenient inventions of the press. Their subsequent use by many historians is misleading. None of these nicknames was ever widely used by either fans or players.\\"Stout, Glenn, and Richard A. Johnson, Red Sox Century. Boston: Houghton Mifflin 2000. Boston Braves Earliest official adoption: 1912 Four players from the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–1870 regrouped in Boston in 1871 (Robert Smith, Baseball in America, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1961, p. 36), which they would call home for the next 83 seasons. In the newly formed National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, the Boston Red Stockings would continue to dominate as they had in Cincinnati, winning 4 of the league's 5 pennants and joining the new National League in 1876. Some sources (such as TSNBBG) say they were renamed the \\"Red Caps\\", presumably in deference to the revived Red Stockings entry in Cincinnati. Local newspapers referred to the club as both \\"Red Stockings\\" and \\"Red Caps\\". In any case, in the 1880s a few sportswriters (not in Boston) referred to them as the Beaneaters on a couple of occasions, a term used for Bostonians in general due to the prevalence of the staple dish baked beans. Boston itself is often called \\"Beantown,\\" but generally not by residents. The media-invented nickname \\"Beaneaters\\" was still in occasional use in the early 1900s, and was even applied to the newly formed American League entry from time to time. The National Leaguers continued to include red trim in their uniforms until 1907, when they temporarily switched to an all-white uniform. The press promptly labeled them the Doves, reinforced by their owner being named Dovey. (Similarly, they were called the Rustlers in 1911 for new owner William Hepburn Russell (baseball).) In 1908, the Americans adopted those colors and became the Red Sox. The Nationals reverted to their red trim and slowly looked for a name of their own. They found one when James Gaffney bought the club. :\\"The nickname of Braves was first given the club at the suggestion of John Montgomery Ward, when James E. Gaffney, from Tammany Hall, became club president in 1912. Previously, the club had been briefly nicknamed the Doves, a name bestowed on the team when George B. and John E. C. Dovey became its owners; and also the Red Caps and Beaneaters.\\" (TSNBBG) The Tammany Hall political organization was named after an American Indian chief and used an Indian image as its symbol, hence the \\"Braves\\". The 1912 team wore an Indian- head logo, and in 1915 the name \\"Braves.\\" Over the years that name has stuck, despite occasional controversy about its stereotyping of Native Americans, and has followed the team through two moves — to Milwaukee in 1953, and to Atlanta in 1966. While still in Boston, the Braves fell into severe doldrums in the 1930s, and were looking for ways to reinvent themselves. :\\"In 1936, when James A. Robert Quinn became president, the name of Bees was selected by a vote of scribes and fans. However, after a new syndicate, including Quinn, took charge in April, 1941, the stockholders re-adopted the nickname of Braves.\\" (TSNBBG) The name \\"Bees\\" did nothing to improve the team's fortunes, and was abandoned by the end of World War II. In 1935 the uniform shirts had read \\"BRAVES\\" and in 1936 they merely said \\"BOSTON\\" on the home as well as the road version. They switched to a block \\"B\\" on home shirts the next year, which remained the pattern most years until the block-letter \\"BRAVES\\" reappeared in 1945. At no point did they wear anything on their uniforms which suggested an actual bee other than the homonym of the letter \\"B\\". In 1946, the script version of \\"Braves\\", complete with tomahawk, made its first appearance and has been on most of the uniform shirts since then. (Okkonen) The Washington Redskins of the NFL began in 1932 as the Boston Braves. They renamed themselves the Redskins the next year, having moved from Braves Field to the Red Sox' Fenway Park, serving the dual purpose of sounding similar to their new baseball co- tenants while allowing them to keep the Native American-logoed uniforms they had worn as the Braves, and in 1937 they moved to Washington, D.C., bringing the nickname with them. Boston Red Sox Earliest official adoption: 1912 (1908) For years many sources have called the early Boston AL teams \\"Pilgrims\\" or \\"Puritans\\" or \\"Plymouth Rocks\\" or \\"Somersets\\" for owner Charles Somers or even the \\"Speed Boys\\".(TSNBBG) Research by SABR writer Bill Nowlin demonstrated that none of those names was used very often and that \\"Pilgrims\\", the most popular revisionist nickname today, was barely used at all.http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's follow-up article in The National Pastime (SABR, 2006), unearthed some sporadic references to \\"Pilgrims\\", presumably as an alternative to the prosaic \\"Americans\\". Apparently this originated with a writer for the Washington Post during 1906, and by 1907 it found occasional use in Boston newspapers. In 1901, the American League, led by Ban Johnson, declared itself equal to the National League and established a competing club in Boston. For seven seasons, the AL team wore dark blue stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \\"Boston\\" or \\"the Bostons\\"; or the \\"Americans\\" or \\"Boston Americans\\" as in \\"American Leaguers\\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 shirts, both home and road, simply read \\"Boston\\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \\"B\\" and \\"A\\" denoting \\"Boston\\" and \\"American\\".(Okkonen) The temporary decision by the Boston National Leaguers to drop the color red from their uniforms led to a history-making decision: :\\"Red Stockings had been part of all Boston National League teams up to 1907, but Fred Tenney, manager in that year, told Peter F. Kelley, the Boston Journal's baseball writer, he would abandon the red stockings tradition in favor of white stockings, because of the danger that colored stockings might cause leg injuries to become infected. Kelley wrote a story condemning Tenney for parting with the Boston National League club's tradition. The next day, John Irving Taylor, Boston American League club president, told the Boston Journal writer, 'Here's a scoop for you. I am going to grab the name Red Sox, and the Boston American League club will wear red stockings.\\" (TSNBBG) The problem with part of that story is that the \\"Doves\\" went through the entire 1907 season wearing white (except for a red old-English \\"B\\" on their shirts) while the American Leaguers continued to wear their dark blue during the 1907 season. (Okkonen) On December 18, 1907, owner Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The name Red Sox is non- standard English for \\"Red Socks\\", short for \\"Red Stockings\\". For the 1908 season, the AL team shirts featured a red stocking across the front labeled \\"BOSTON\\". They also wore red stockings, along with white caps. Meanwhile, for 1908, the NL team returned to wearing red stockings as well as red caps, while retaining the old-English \\"B\\". So the primary visual differences between the two teams' uniforms in 1908 were the caps and the shirt fronts.(Okkonen) The red stocking on the shirt front was a one-year innovation before returning to the plain \\"BOSTON\\". The familiar \\"RED SOX\\" first appeared in 1912, coincident with the opening of Fenway Park. Through the years, the Red Sox have continued to wear red somewhere in their uniforms. By the 1930s, the color blue was re- added to the mix. (Okkonen) Headline writers often call the team \\"Bosox\\", to contrast with the Chicago White Sox or \\"Chisox\\". As with Chicago, when the team's fans are talking about their own team, they are apt to call them simply \\"The Sox\\". The National Football League Boston team, who played their first season at Braves Field and called themselves the \\"Braves\\" after their hosts, moved into Fenway Park in 1933. Since the old name would no longer do, they changed their Indian-inspired name to \\"Redskins\\" to harmonize with \\"Red Sox\\". Brooklyn Together with New York City across the East River,At the time, New York meant Manhattan; in 1874 it absorbed the Bronx and in 1898 Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens to form the modern metropolis Brooklyn was the cradle of organized baseball, producing some of the strongest clubs of the amateur and early professional era; these included Atlantic, Eckford and Excelsior. Atlantic turned pro in 1869 and became nationally famous by ending the Cincinnati Red Stockings' winning streak in 1870. Brooklyn Dodgers Earliest official adoption: 1916 The Dodgers have had a number of nicknames through the years. This team began as the Brooklyn Atlantics in the American Association of the 1880s, its name a reference to the storied amateur club of the 1860s. Reporters also tagged them the Grays, the typical uniform-color reference of the day. These however were very occasional; overwhelmingly newspaper writeups simply called them \\"Brooklyn\\" or, more often, \\"the Brooklyns.\\" In 1888, six members of the team were married during the season, and the press tagged the club as the Bridegrooms or just the Grooms. (TSNBBG) In the early 1890s, the club had switched to the National League. The city of Brooklyn installed the transportation innovation called the trolley system. Its citizens thus became \\"trolley dodgers\\" to the newswriters. By association, the team itself acquired that nickname, as the honeymoon for the \\"Grooms\\" was over after several years. (TSNBBG) Officially, however, the team remained the Brooklyn Base Ball Association, sans nickname. https://collection.baseballhall.org/PASTIME/new-york-giants-versus-brooklyn- bridegrooms-scorecard-1897-may-07-2 Brooklyn was a separate city from New York until 1898, and its teams retained the name \\"Brooklyn\\". During the late 1890s, when Ned Hanlon was the manager and the Dodgers won the pennant (thanks in part to raiding the Baltimore Orioles roster), there happened to be a stage or circus act called \\"The Hanlons' Superba\\".https://www.loc.gov/resource/var.0512/ https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/5e66b3e8-e5b1-d471-e040-e00a180654d7 The New York press, in their usual creative way, began calling Ned Hanlon's Dodgers the Superbas. (TSNBBG) Around 1910, the club was briefly tagged as the Infants, from a remark by president Charles Ebbets, who had declared in a speech that \\"Baseball is in its infancy.\\" In the words of TSNBBG, \\"The monicker clung until Thomas J. Lynch, then president of the National League, asked baseball writers to accept waivers on it.\\" Once Wilbert Robinson was well established and beloved as the Dodgers manager, the team was called the Robins as often as anything. The nickname \\"Dodgers\\" continued to be used also. After Robby retired, the team became just the \\"Dodgers\\" again. The club finally acknowledged its informal nickname in 1916, when the home World Series programs were boldly titled \\"Dodgers vs Red Sox;\\" and yet, that same season, the Brooklyn Eagle used \\"Superbas\\" in its box scores, years after Hanlon's retirement, and a cartoon on the record 26-inning game vs Boston that year used a robin to represent the team. In 1933, the team put the word \\"Dodgers\\" on their shirts for the first time, in block letters. The famous script \\"Dodgers\\" first appeared in 1938. (Okkonen) When the club moved to the west coast in 1958, they brought their nickname with them, although it had no particular meaning in Los Angeles. The \\"Bums\\" nickname arose due to the cartoons of Willard Mullin, characterizing the citizenry of Brooklyn in an unflattering but humorous way. Chicago Chicago is unique in Major League Baseball in that both of its charter member clubs have remained in their original cities. Various other clubs had brief lifespans in the Windy City also. The entry in the one-year wonder called the Union Association was called the Chicago Browns by some writers. The club lasted half a season and then transferred to Pittsburgh where, continuing their color scheme, they were called the Stogies. The Players' League was a one-year rebellion by players. The entry in the Windy City, called the Chicago Pirates, were led by Charles Comiskey, who would return to the South Side nine years later, as an owner, and with a decidedly more conservative attitude toward player salaries. When the Federal League began its two-year experiment, it placed a team in Chicago. Although the Fed was known for colorful nicknames, the best anyone could come up with for the Chicago Federals' first year, 1914, was the Chi-Feds. For the second and final Fed season, which proved to be a pennant winner for the Chi- Feds, the name Chicago Whales was used, despite the lack of any known whales in Lake Michigan. The uniforms featured a whale icon inside a large round \\"C\\", suggestive of the Cubs' logo of that time, a large round \\"C\\" encircling a bear cub. (Okkonen) The Chi-Fed Whales' lasting legacy is Wrigley Field, which the Cubs moved into after the Federal League collapsed and have played there ever since. Chicago Cubs First official use: 1907 In 1870, the first openly professional team in Chicago, officially named simply the Chicago Ball Club,Constitution and Playing Rules of the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs, p.2. Chicago: A. G. Spalding 1877. was dubbed the White Stockings, in reference to the team colors and in contrast to the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The team carried that nickname along to the NA in 1871 and into the NL in 1876. The Chicago club was indeed frequently referred to in newspaper articles as the White Stockings right from the 1870 season onward, making it one of the few \\"real\\" nicknames among those artificially retrofitted to the era's teams by sportwriters. After the team's successes in the first half of the 1880s, the club began trading away its stars, and by the end of the decade the team was populated by young players, with the exception of long-time player–manager Cap Anson. By the late 1880s, local newspapers had started to call the team \\"Anson's Colts\\", or just \\"Colts\\". With the advent of the Players' League in 1890, what little talent the club still had was drained away, and the nickname, though never \\"official\\", became standard. (The Golden Era Cubs: 1876–1940, Eddie Gold and Art Ahrens, Bonus Books, 1985, p. 2) and :\\"Charley Hoyt wrote a play for Cap Anson, manager of the team, called 'The Runaway Colt', and subsequently the team was called Anson's Colts.\\"(TSNBBG) Actually, it was the other way around. The play was written and produced late in 1895, and its name was inspired by the club's nickname. (The National Pastime, Number 25, SABR, 2005, \\"Anson on Broadway\\", p.74-81.) In any case, 1890 is the usual date given for the replacement of \\"White Stockings\\" with \\"Colts\\" as the club's predominant nickname. The 1894 Spalding Guide refers to the team - once - as \\"Anson's so-called Chicago 'colts'.\\" The Colts name would stick around, off and on, for the next 15 years. It was reinforced by a squad of many young players, contrasting with the veteran Anson, who had become known as \\"Pop\\" by the 1890s. Anson left the team after the 1897 season, and the local papers called the team the Orphans for a while, because they had lost their \\"Pop\\". They apparently still had some \\"pop\\" in their bats, finishing fourth in a twelve-team league. :\\"A Chicago newspaper held a contest to select a new name. The term Cubs was chosen, but as other newspapers ignored the name at first, it was some time before the new nickname came into general use. Fred Hayner, sports editor of the Chicago Daily News, was among the first to use the name of Cubs.\\" (TSNBBG) The 2007 Arcadia book called Chicago Cubs: Tinker to Evers to Chance, by Art Ahrens, contains a series of facts in various places on pages 9–56 that add up to an explanation of the gradual transition from \\"Colts\\" to \\"Cubs\\": *The newspapers predominantly called the club the \\"Orphans\\" during 1898–1900. *The few promising players on the club jumped to the new American League in 1901, including several to the White Sox. The erstwhile \\"Orphans\\" had so few good players left that the papers called them the \\"Remnants\\", as the 53–86 team's percentage would stand as the club's record low for the next 60 years. *When Frank Selee took over the managerial reins in 1902, his youth program revived the older nickname, and the team was again called the \\"Colts\\" in the papers frequently. *At that same time, also referencing the team's youthful squad, some writers starting calling the team the \\"Cubs\\". *The \\"Cubs\\" nickname took hold over the next four seasons. Sporting Life leaned toward \\"Cubs\\", while The Sporting News favored \\"Colts\\", as did the Chicago Tribune. During 1905, \\"Colts\\" was still more common, as Selee preferred that name. But Selee retired due to ill health in mid-season 1905, and Frank Chance was elevated to the managing job. With new management and an emerging dynasty, by 1906 the old \\"Colts\\" was largely passé and \\"Cubs\\" was the primary nickname. *Among various short-lived and little- remembered nicknames laid on the team by the media around 1906, perhaps the funniest was \\"Murphy's Spuds\\" or just \\"Spuds\\", a reference to Irish-American team owner Charles Murphy, and the stereotype connecting Irish people with potatoes (Irish potatoes were colloquially called \\"Murphy spuds\\" or just \\"Murphys\\"). By the time the Chicago National Leaguers played their cross-town World Series with the White Sox in 1906, the \\"Chicago Cubs\\" nickname was well established. An editorial cartoon after the Series showed a cabin with an unknown figure inside, with only his white socks visible, up on a footrest, with the skin of a bear nailed to the wall outside, and six more white socks hanging on a clothesline (the Sox had beaten the Cubs in six games). (John Devaney and Burt Goldblatt, The World Series: A Complete Pictorial History, Rand McNally, 1975, p. 27). By 1907, the name \\"Cubs\\" was appearing on the team's scorecards. (Ahrens) The first uniform acknowledgment of the nickname came in 1908, when a bear cub holding a bat was placed inside the round \\"C\\" that was already on the uniform shirt. The 1908 World Series home programs used both the Cubs name and image frequently. The familiar \\"C\\" encircling \\"UBS\\" first appeared the following year, on the road shirts. With this official acknowledgment, the old nickname of \\"Colts\\" was gone for good. Either a bear cub symbol or the word \\"CUBS\\" has appeared on home and/or road shirts ever since then. (Okkonen) Despite the best efforts of the MLB Promotion Corporation, which began in the late 1960s, the Cubs did not trademark this iconic circle-C-UBS logo (which has been a steady fixture on uniforms and publications since 1937) until the late 1970s. The nickname \\"Cubbies\\", a diminutive of something already small or young, gained favor in large part due to Harry Caray's famous rendering of \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\". Instead of drawing out the single-syllable \\"Cubs\\" into two syllables in place of \\"home team\\", Caray used \\"Cubbies\\" to make the line flow better. The Chicago Bears of the National Football League played their games at the Cubs' Wrigley Field from 1921–1970, and were renamed (from \\"Staleys\\") in honor of their hosts. Chicago White Sox First official use: 1906 (Stockings); 1912 (Sox) \\"Anson's National Leaguers had been known as the White Stockings, and when Charles Comiskey brought his St. Paul Saints team into the city of his birth in 1900, Carl Green of Detroit and Irving E. (Si) Sanborn, covering baseball in the Windy City, revived the name White Stockings.\\" (TSNBBG) The new American League entry adopted the abandoned colors and nickname of their National League rivals. They were initially called the \\"White Stockings\\", a nickname quickly shortened to White Sox by the press. The transition can be seen in the 1906 Spalding Guide, in which both \\"White Stockings\\" and \\"White Sox\\" appear. In 1912, the team started wearing the first incarnation of its \\"SOX\\" logo on the shirts. (Okkonen) The team is often called the \\"Chisox\\" by headline writers, to distinguish from \\"Bosox\\". The synonym \\"Pale Hose\\" is also used. Within the city, as with Boston, the team is often just plain \\"Sox\\". The Hispanic community of Chicago calls them Las Medias Blancas, Spanish for \\"The White Stockings\\". Cincinnati Cincinnati Red Stockings The first openly all-professional team was the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–1870. They began as an amateur organization in the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1866, as interest in baseball grew substantially after the American Civil War. Interest in the Red Stockings themselves grew as they compiled an impressive winning streak while mostly on a road tour or \\"barnstorming\\". The nickname \\"Red Stockings\\" was originally a press appellation based on their uniforms, in fact the 1869 Cincinnati club inaugurated the baseball tradition of wearing knickers with knee socks instead of long trousers, a style some contemporary prudes considered shocking and immoral; but player/manager Harry Wright quickly saw its appeal for marketing purposes and by midseason the club had adopted the name and called itself the Red Stockings Base Ball Club of Cincinnati. The Red Stockings went through 1869 and partway into 1870 undefeated, their streak finally ending on June 14, 1870. Interest in the team waned after that, and while the club gained much fame and acclaim, the team's profit margin was slim. The club's executives decided to disband the team for 1871. But the influence of this team was substantial. By 1870, professionalism was wide open, spelling the end of the \\"amateur era\\", and paving the way to the first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, which began operating in 1871. With the Cincinnati Red Stockings dissolved, four of its players regrouped in Boston to join the new National Association (often called the NA for short, by modern historians). Manager Harry Wright and his brother George Wright (baseball's version of the \\"Wright brothers\\") brought along Cal McVey and Charlie Gould to form the Boston Red Stockings, which eventually evolved into the Atlanta Braves (q.v.) Cincinnati Reds First official use: 1911 Due to the influence of the Red Stockings, nearly every professional team in Cincinnati since then has worn red as their primary trim color. The Cincinnati teams have also tended to associate themselves with the 1869-70 club, but there is no direct connection other than the name. When the NA folded, the best teams, and some new ones, regrouped to form the National League in 1876. One of the new teams was called the Cincinnati Red Stockings, reclaiming the old name. The team was expelled from the National League in 1880 for selling beer at games and playing on Sundays. In 1882 a new league formed to challenge the established NL: The American Association. The AA appealed to a different, rowdier market than the stoic NL, by offering cheaper admission prices as well as alcoholic beverages, which at that time were forbidden in the NL ballparks. Ironically, this \\"AA\\" became known as \\"The Beer and Whisky League\\", and was criticized by the NL leadership for placing so many of its teams in \\"river towns\\", characterizing the AA cities as being populated by low-class citizens: Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis. The new version of the Cincinnati Red Stockings (later shortened to Cincinnati Reds; the earliest mention of \\"Reds\\" in the Spalding Guide dates from the 1895 edition) became prosperous. The team won the first American Association pennant, and survived most of Association's ten-year existence, transferring to the National League in 1890. For 1891, a short lived \\"Cincinnati Reds\\" entry joined the Association, otherwise known as \\"Kelly's Killers\\". The club failed to finish the season and was replaced by Milwaukee. By then the Association was floundering, and collapsed after the season ended.Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide 1895. Chicago and New York: A. G. Spalding and Brothers 1895, p. 19 The NL Reds continue to play in Cincinnati to this day. The team first used the single \\"C\\" on its uniforms in 1905. The word \\"Reds\\" was placed inside the \\"C\\" for the first time in 1911. Variants on that style have been used in most years since then. (Okkonen) Having shortened their name brought them some trouble in the 1950s, or more accurately the fear of trouble. The term \\"Reds\\" in the political arena had long been a synonym for \\"Communist\\". During the McCarthy era, Fried, Richard M., Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective, Oxford University Press even though there was no connection between professional baseball and Communism, the team was concerned that their traditional club nickname would associate them with the Communist Threat and the Cold War, so they officially changed their name to the \\"Cincinnati Redlegs\\". From 1956 to 1960, the club's logo was altered to remove the term \\"REDS\\" from the inside of the \\"wishbone C\\" symbol. The \\"REDS\\" reappeared on the 1961 uniforms, although habits being what they were, by then they were often called \\"Redlegs\\", and that name took a few years to totally fade out. (Okkonen) An NFL entry that played briefly in the early 1930s was called the Cincinnati Reds. The nickname \\"Red Stockings\\" and its descendants reflect one of the oldest nicknames in baseball, topped only by the Athletics, originally of Philadelphia and now in Oakland, and \\"Mets\\", a variation of \\"Metropolitans\\", a name that goes back to an amateur baseball club in New York in the 1850s. Cleveland Cleveland is known as \\"The Forest City\\", and its early-1870s pro team was called the Forest City Base Ball Club or just the \\"Forest Citys\\", in the style of the day. During the 1871 season, \\"Cleveland\\" was often part of their name in newspapers, to distinguish from the Rockford Forest Citys of the same league. The National League entry of the 1890s was dubbed the Cleveland Spiders by the press, supposedly because of its long- limbed players. One player during 1897–1899 was Louis Sockalexis, a Native American. His ballplaying skills caught a great deal of attention, though his career was short. During those three seasons, the team was sometimes called the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland Indians First official use: 1915 After the 1899 debacle of 20 wins and 134 losses, in which the once-proud Spiders were redubbed the \\"Wanderers\\" and the \\"Exiles\\" due to being relegated to a road franchise, the NL contracted the Cleveland club out of existence. A new team formed the very next year in the young American League. The uniforms featured dark blue, and the team was labeled the \\"Blues\\" and \\"Bluebirds\\" by the media, among other short-lived nicknames. In 1903 club ownership conducted a newspaper contest to choose a name for the team, and selected Napoleons for newly acquired star player-manager Napoleon Lajoie; in popular usage this was quickly shortened to \\"Naps.\\" The fact that they would go to the papers is a reflection of where most of the team nicknames of that era came from. During the tenure of manager Deacon McGuire, the team was also sometimes facetiously called the \\"Molly Maguires\\". (TSNBBG) The team was strong in the early 1900s, but lapsed in the 1910s and \\"Naps\\" began to be taken as a joke equated to \\"sleeping\\". When Lajoie was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics in early January 1915, owner Charles Somers asked the local newspapers again to come up with a new name for the team. Legend has it that the team specifically honored Louis Sockalexis when it assumed its current name in mid-January 1915. Another version is that the media and the team chose Cleveland Indians as a play on the name of the Boston Braves, then known as the \\"Miracle Braves\\" after going from last place on July 4 to a sweep in the 1914 World Series. The informal \\"Indians\\" name sometimes used during Sockalexis' time with the club reinforced the new name. With the artificial connection to Native Americans, the Cleveland Indians are also often called \\"The Tribe\\". In the movie Major League, the Cleveland Indians are referred to by many names, including \\"The Erie Warriors\\", \\"The Sons of Geronimo\\" and \\"The Fighting Braves of the Cuyahoga.\\" In 2020, the club joins other sports franchises having Native American nicknames, exploring whether to modify or change the name to something different. Dallas–Fort Worth There have been minor league clubs in the Dallas – Fort Worth area since at least 1888. One was the Dallas Rangers of the Pacific Coast League, and the other was the Fort Worth Cats/Panthers of the Texas League. In 1965, the Dallas club left the city, and the Fort Worth club moved to Arlington, a city about halfway in between the two major cities. The renamed Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs operated for seven years in Arlington before the majors came knocking. Texas Rangers First official use: 1972 The 1961 expansion version of the Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, in 1972 and took on the nickname Texas Rangers. The name refers to the famous Texas Ranger Division, the law enforcement agency that was created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823. Up until the end of the 2008 season, the team bore the word \\"RANGERS\\" on their home jerseys and \\"TEXAS\\" on their road jerseys. Since then, the team has worn \\"TEXAS\\" at home and on the road. Denver Colorado Rockies The Colorado Rockies became a new franchise into Major League Baseball in 1993. The nickname \\"Rockies\\" alludes to the Rocky Mountains which cover much of the western half of Colorado. The name Colorado Rockies had been used by a National Hockey League team that lasted from 1976–1982, before the team relocated and became the New Jersey Devils. Detroit The first major league team in the city was dubbed the Wolverines, who contended in the National League during 1881–1888. The nickname, which is now primarily associated with the University of Michigan teams, came from Michigan's nickname, the \\"Wolverine State\\". The club's ownership spent a great deal of money to bring a championship team to Detroit, and the team won an early World Series in 1887. However, Detroit at the time did not have a large enough population to sustain a major league franchise, and the team folded after one more season. Several minor league clubs came and went over the next few years, typically tagged as Wolverines. Detroit Tigers First official use: 1901 The new minor league entry in the Western League was also called the Wolverines. This club came to stay. The league was renamed the American League in 1900, and the Detroit franchise is still in the league, the one Western League franchise still in its original city, nurtured as it was by the growth of the auto industry in the 20th Century. There are various legends about how the Tigers got their nickname. One involves the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings: :\\"Philip J. Reid, a Detroit city editor, tagged the players as Tigers before the turn of the century. George Stallings, manager at Detroit during 1899–1901, always claimed the nickname came after he put striped stockings on his players, but they have always been Tigers in the American League.\\" (TSNBBG) Another legend concerns a sportswriter equating the 1901 team's opening day victory with the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers. The earliest known use of the name Detroit Tigers in the news was in the Detroit Free Press on April 16, 1895. Richard Bak's 1998 book, A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium has the full story. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as \\"The Tigers\\". They had played significant roles in certain Civil War battles and in the Spanish–American War. The baseball team was called both the \\"Wolverines\\" and the \\"Tigers\\" in the newspapers. Upon entry into the major leagues in 1901, the ballclub sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use its trademark, and from that day forth the team has been officially the \\"Tigers\\". Certainly when the team started major-league play in 1901, they were already wearing a tiger logo on their caps.https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/5950681901/Detroit_Tigers/1901/Cap_Logo In short, the Tigers most likely wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which was the conventional story. In fact, the Tigers wore a red stripe on their socks in 1901, and generally avoided stripes after that until beginning to wear orange stripes for a while in the 1920s. (Okkonen) The Detroit Lions of the NFL were named in reference to their then-landlords, the Tigers. The Detroit Red Wings of the NHL were originally called the \\"Cougars\\", but that referred to their point of origin as the Victoria Cougars. Their early name's apparent relationship to the Tigers and/or Lions was coincidental. The University of Detroit, the main predecessor to today's University of Detroit Mercy, initially used \\"Tigers\\" as its athletic nickname. The school changed its nickname to Titans in 1919 or 1924, depending on the source. This nickname remained in use for the rest of UD's separate existence, and was inherited by UDM upon the 1990 merger with Mercy College of Detroit that created the current university. Houston The minor league teams of first the Texas League and then the American Association were primarily known as the Houston Buffaloes, or often just \\"Buffs\\". They were named after Houston's Buffalo Bayou, which has always been a geographic and culturally significant hallmark of the city. Houston Astros Houston joined Major League Baseball in 1962 when the National League expanded and placed a franchise in Texas for the first time. The team's original nickname was the Houston Colt .45s, a reference to the famous Colt firearms company. The team itself used a Colt .45s logo, but was most often called just the \\"Colts\\", a somewhat ambiguous term as it also applies to young horses and skirted the legal issues that eventually influenced the name's abandonment by the club. In 1965 the team changed its nickname to Houston Astros, a name that had more futuristic overtones (astro is Greek for \\"star\\") as since 1961 Houston was the city where NASA trained (and continues to train) all the American astronauts. The team also used the nickname as part of its new home, the Astrodome, which opened in 1965. This name change was driven in part by legal considerations. The Sporting News Official Baseball Guide for 1965 explained why the team was renamed: \\"Late in the year 1964 the Harris County Domed Stadium was officially named the Astrodome after the Houston club changed its nickname, December 1, from Colt .45s to Astros. The move resulted from objections by the Colt Firearms Company to the club's sales of novelties bearing the old nickname.\\" The nickname 'Stros is often used as a familiar name. Kansas City, Missouri Being at the fringe of the old west, and thus connected with cowboys and cattle, several of Kansas City's teams have had nicknames reflecting that culture. There were three different short-lived major league teams in the 1800s, members of the Union Association in 1884, the National League in 1886, and the American Association in 1888 and 1889. The 1880s were the peak years of the great western cattle drives, and Kansas City the biggest of all cow-towns; it was inevitable that sportswriters would tag these men from the Wild West as \\"Cowboys.\\" The minor league entry in the Western League (original) in the late 1890s was the first to be called the Kansas City Blues, presumably from their team colors. The Western League became the American League in 1900, still a minor league. When the American went major in 1901, the Kansas City entry was dropped. A revived minor league club also called the Kansas City Blues operated in the American Association during the first half of the 20th Century. The team became a New York Yankees farm team in the 1930s. The team transferred to Denver in 1955 when the Philadelphia Athletics came to town as the Kansas City Athletics. Ironically, that \\"Yankees Kansas City farm club\\" situation continued, as the A's ownership fed numerous quality players to the Yankees until the 1960s when Charles O. Finley acquired the team. Finley soon incurred the wrath of Kansas City fans also, and transferred the team to Oakland in 1968. Perhaps the most famous team in Kansas City was the Kansas City Monarchs, the longest-running of the various Negro league baseball teams that operated as an apartheid culture until major league baseball was integrated in 1947 by one-time Monarch Jackie Robinson. Continuing the dubious Kansas City tradition, the Monarchs effectively served as a \\"farm club\\" for all of the major leagues in their waning years, supplying a number of star black players to the majors before folding in the 1960s. Kansas City Athletics In 1954, the club's last year in Philadelphia, the \\"A\\" was replaced for the first time with the word \\"Athletics\\", on both home and road shirts. At no time in their 54-year tenure in Philadelphia did the word \\"Philadelphia\\" appear on their shirts. The team transferred to Kansas City in 1955 and continued to wear \\"Athletics\\" on both home and road shirts. The city name finally appeared on road shirts for the first time in 1961, after Charles O. Finley had acquired the team. Finley began a well-documented series of influential uniform innovations that are beyond the scope of this article. He moved the A's to Oakland in 1968, where they have remained to this day. (Okkonen) In 1972 Finley changed the team's official name to the longstanding nickname \\"A's\\"; \\"Athletics\\" was restored in 1981. Kansas City Royals The American League expanded in 1969, and made good on a pledge to return the majors to Kansas City, by creating the Kansas City Royals. Pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman won the bidding for the new Kansas City team, which was named the Royals after the American Royal Livestock Show held in Kansas City every year since 1899. Some sources have incorrectly reported that the team was named in honor of the Kansas City Monarchs. Apparently it is just a happy coincidence. Also, in an unspoken and possibly coincidental continuation of tradition, the Royals' uniforms carry blue trim. Los Angeles area The minor league teams had been known as the Los Angeles Angels since the founding of the Pacific Coast League in 1903, named after the city itself. That team name contained a built-in redundancy if fully translated into English: \\"The Angels Angels\\". Los Angeles Dodgers The minor league team and the nickname were displaced when the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League moved coast-to-coast in 1958. The Los Angeles Dodgers carried their successful ways, and there were no trolleys to be dodged in Los Angeles. Los Angeles Angels When major league baseball expanded in 1961, a new entry in the American League revived the old nickname. The team was renamed the California Angels in 1965, anticipating their move to Anaheim. After 32 years as \\"California\\", the team became the \\"Anaheim Angels\\" starting with the 1997 season, as a result of a contractual agreement connected with renovations to their stadium. Starting with the 2005 season, the club again changed its name. The ownership wanted to revert to the original name, Los Angeles Angels, for marketing reasons. This caused legal problems with the city of Anaheim, since the franchise was contractually required to keep \\"Anaheim\\" in the team name. As a result, the official designation became the wordy \\"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\\" and the geographic location has been removed from the team's jerseys. Miami Florida / Miami Marlins Minor league teams had been known as the Miami Marlins for several decades, referencing the marlin, a popular sport fish. There were the Miami Marlins of the International League (1956–60) and the Miami Marlins (1962–70) and Miami Marlins (1982–88) of the Florida State League. When the major leagues expanded to the Miami area in 1993, the old nickname was revived, but the team was initially known as the Florida Marlins. By identifying with the entire state instead of the city, the name's alliterative quality was lost. However, the team officially adopted the Miami Marlins name on November 11, 2011. This was part of a funding agreement between the team and the city of Miami for the team's new stadium which opened in 2012. The Marlins are commonly nicknamed \\"the Fish\\". Milwaukee Milwaukee's various professional teams, going back to the 1870s, had names like the Cream Citys and the Brewers, in reference to the local unique cream brick industry and brewing industry respectively. In particular, some famous breweries included Schlitz (\\"The beer that made Milwaukee famous\\"), Blatz, Pabst, and later Miller Beer, which today holds naming rights to the current stadium. There was a short-lived major league entry, sometimes called the Milwaukee Grays, which operated in the National League in 1878. Milwaukee Brewers The Brewers of the minor Western League of the 1890s were retained during the league's inaugural major league season as the American League in 1901, before being moved to become the St. Louis Browns. The revived minor league club in the American Association was then called the Milwaukee Brewers for some 50 years before being displaced by the transplanted Boston Braves in 1953. The major league club retained their traditional nickname as the Milwaukee Braves during their stay in Milwaukee, before moving on to Atlanta in 1966. The city was mostly without professional baseball for a few years. Future team owner and later Commissioner Bud Selig began a lobbying group originally called \\"Team, Inc.\\" and then renamed \\"Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.\\" The Chicago White Sox played some home games in Milwaukee in that interval. The current Milwaukee Brewers began as the Seattle Pilots, a 1969 expansion team in the American League. After one year of significant financial losses, the team was transplanted to Milwaukee, under the new ownership of Selig, whereupon they revived the traditional name \\"Brewers\\". The team was switched to the National League in 1998 as part of the expansion and reorganization of the major leagues. Minneapolis – Saint Paul The two adjacent cities have had a long-standing, mostly-friendly rivalry, and each city had high-level minor league clubs, including teams in the American Association for the better part of five decades. The Minneapolis clubs were usually called the Minneapolis Millers, Minneapolis being known as the \\"Mill City\\". St. Paul, as the state capital, avoided the usual stereotype of teams called \\"Senators\\", \\"Solons\\" or \\"Capitals\\", and instead went for a more direct stereotype. The city's early teams were typically called the St. Paul Saints or Apostles, including the city's short lived Union Association entry in 1884. Later the city's minor league clubs adopted the St. Paul Saints nickname, a self-contained redundancy. The Western League club from the 1890s moved to Chicago in 1900 and became the Chicago White Sox. The revived minor league Saints joined their cross-river rivals in the American Association for much of the first half of the 1900s. The Saints name was revived by an independent minor league club in 1993. Minnesota Twins Minneapolis – St. Paul is commonly known as the \\"Twin Cities\\". The formal name of the team, which transferred from Washington, D.C., in 1961, was initially the Twin Cities Baseball Club, now known as Twins Sports, Inc. The Millers caps had featured an \\"M\\" and the Saints caps an interlaced \\"StP\\". The newly transferred Minnesota Twins club wore a cap featuring \\"TC\\" for \\"Twin Cities\\" to honor both St. Paul and Minneapolis. The shirts included a sleeve patch with an outline of the state and two ballplayers shaking hands across the Mississippi River. By 1987 the Twins were regionally established, and a cap featuring an \\"M\\" for \\"Minnesota\\" was adopted. The \\"TC\\" logo migrated to the sleeve in place of the previous patch. The team won the World Series that year, so the \\"M\\" cap became a symbol of success and continued to be used exclusively for a number of years afterward. The \\"TC\\" cap reappeared in the late 1990s, and is now switched off with the \\"M\\" cap. (Okkonen) \\"TC\\" is usually used as the team's home cap, with \\"M\\" as the road cap, though the cap, as with other elements of the team's uniform, is chosen at the whim of the starting pitcher. Another nickname used by fans and writers, but not by the team, is \\"Twinkies\\", though that name is used more as an insult by the fans of competing teams. Montreal Before Major League Baseball expanded to Montreal in 1969, minor league teams in Montreal were usually named the \\"Royals\\", in reference to Mount Royal (), a volcanic plug immediately west of today's downtown after which the city was named. Hence another redundancy, the \\"Mount Royal Royals\\". Montreal Expos The Montreal Expos were named in honor of Expo 67, a World's Fair held two years before the Expos began play. The Expos moved to Washington in 2005, and the \\"Expos\\" name was retired. New York City As the cradle of organized baseball, New York City had many clubs in the \\"amateur\\" era leading up to 1869–1870, and the \\"professional\\" era after that. Knickerbocker, Mutual and Gotham were some of the more prominent clubs. The short-lived Federal League entry in New York was the Brooklyn Tip-Tops. The Fed teams had some innovative names, and this was probably the only major league team ever named for a loaf of bread. New York Mets Since the amateur Metropolitan Base Ball Club was founded in New York as far back as 1857, three years before Athletic of Philadelphia, the Mets can claim to have the oldest team name in major-league baseball. The first professional Metropolitan Baseball Club was a member of the 19th Century American Association, a club which lasted until 1887 but could not compete with the Giants. They were normally listed as \\"Metropolitan\\" in the standings, and writers would sometimes use the pluralized \\"Metropolitans\\" or just \\"Mets\\" in the style of the day, to distinguish them from the \\"New Yorks\\", their next-door neighbors. The Metropolitans were never referred to as \\"New York.\\" When major league baseball expanded in 1962, the old name was revived in the form of the Metropolitan Baseball Club of New York, otherwise known as the New York Mets. \\"Met\\" is a common short form of \\"Metropolitan\\", as in \\"The Met\\" for the Metropolitan Opera; \\"MetLife\\" for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and so on. The New York Jets of the NFL, originally known as the New York Titans, were the first of several New York area teams whose names rhymed with \\"Mets\\". Others included the New York Nets of the NBA (now Brooklyn Nets), and the New York Sets of the short-lived Team Tennis league. New York Giants First official use: 1911 The early entry of this team in 1883 was simply the New Yorks, also sometimes called the Gothams, \\"Gotham\\" being a synonym for New York City. According to legend, manager Jim Mutrie was bragging to newspaper reporters about the stature of his players, \\"My big fellows! My giants!\\" and by about 1885 the name was stuck on the team for good. :\\"The club was first called the Giants about 1885. P.J. Donohue, New York World baseball writer, probably picked up a chance to get into a type argument with Harry Palmer of Chicago and Charles F. Mathison of Detroit. All three scribes followed teams that had big men, were proud of that fact, and stressed the poundage and height of their athletes. The New York Nationals, after playing an exhibition game with Newark in 1886, were called Giants; and when they appeared in St. Louis later the same year, Joe Pritchard, Mound City expert at that time, alluded to them as the Gotham Giants.\\" (TSNBBG) The problem with that story is that the Giants nickname was already in use in newspapers by 1884. By 1885, it was well-established in the press. Although unofficial for a long time, it remains one of the oldest team names in MLB. \\"Giants\\" was one of the only team nicknames used with any frequency at all in 1886 newspaper writeups, and the only team nickname, period, found in Spalding's Official Guide for 1889. However, the team's official name, as printed on its scorecards, remained simply the New York Base Ball Club.https://collection.baseballhall.org/PASTIME/philadelphia-phillies-versus- new-york-giants-scorecard-1893-august-12-0 Although the \\"Giants\\" nickname was well established, it wasn't endorsed by the franchise until they put it on the home programs for the 1911 World Series; the prosaic \\"NEW YORK\\" or simple block letters \\"NY\\" were used on uniform shirts until 1918 when \\"GIANTS\\" first appeared. (Okkonen) Eventually the alternate nickname \\"Jints\\" (rhymes with \\"pints\\") was picked up as a colloquial pronunciation of the team name. It followed them, along with their real nickname \\"Giants\\", when they moved to the west coast in 1958. The New York Giants of the NFL were named for the baseball team which was once their landlord. Even though the baseball Giants moved in 1958, the NFL team to this day displays a sign at MetLife Stadium proudly indicating that the team's official name remains the \\"New York Football Giants.\\" New York Yankees Modern writers tend to refer to the New York AL club as the \\"Highlanders\\" for its 1903–1912 era and as the \\"Yankees\\" from 1913 onward. The two nicknames actually developed in parallel starting around 1904, with \\"Highlanders\\" initially more often used, and \\"Yankees\\" becoming the predominant nickname before \\"Highlanders\\" was fully dropped in 1913. Initially the team was simply the \\"Greater New York Baseball Club\\", a designation imposed on them as part of the \\"deal\\" allowing the Baltimore club to transfer to New York. Giants fans considered them to be \\"Invaders\\", and publisher William Randolph Hearst's New York Evening Journal initially referred to the new club by that name in 1903. Both \\"Highlanders\\" and \\"Yankees\\" were also initially inventions of the press. The first president of the new New York American League entry was Joseph Gordon, who served from 1903–1906. There was a noted British military unit called The Gordon Highlanders. The new team built its new ballpark on a high point of Manhattan called \\"The Hilltop\\" (hence the informal nickname \\"Hilltop Park\\" for the American League Park), which contrasted especially with the altitude of the Giants, whose Polo Grounds was in the bottomland in the shadow of Coogan's Bluff. Creative members of the press, who liked to make artificial connections between disparate elements of popular culture, dubbed the team \\"Gordon's Highlanders\\" (e.g. New York World, April 15, 1903), soon shortened to just \\"Highlanders\\", and the name stuck with them for the better part of a decade. There is no evidence that \\"Highlanders\\" was ever officially adopted by the team itself. The uniforms only sported a large block \\"N Y\\", which eventually evolved into the well-known curving NY logo of the Yankees. (Okkonen) A prophetic letter to the editor of the New York Sun, May 7, 1903, p. 8, raised this question: \\"Name for the American New Yorks. If the new baseball team is to have a name that is in keeping with the 'Giants,' does it not seem reasonable that if they are the 'New York Americans' they might be called the 'Yankees' or 'Yanks'?\\" The alternate nickname \\"Yankees\\" first appeared regularly in the press in 1904. The term \\"Yankee\\" or \\"Yank\\" is a synonym for \\"American\\". The new team was in the American League, and the papers for cities with two teams (such as Boston) would often call their teams \\"Nationals\\" or \\"Americans\\" to distinguish them. The term \\"Yankee\\" was also in the news frequently at that time, especially with the success of George M. Cohan's Broadway musical, Little Johnny Jones, and its centerpiece number, \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\". To the creative writers of the New York press, the connection was easy to make. On April 7, , a spring training story from Richmond, Virginia carried the headline \\"Yankees Will Start Home From South To-Day.\\" The New York Evening Journal screamed: \\"YANKEES BEAT BOSTON\\". The Sporting Life for a game of April 4, 1905, discussing the acquisition of Hal Chase, referred to the team as the \\"Americans\\" and the \\"Highlanders\\" in the same writeup. As the decade progressed, the nickname \\"Yankees\\" began to be used more and more often. The New York Times writeup about Cy Young's no-hitter of June 30, 1908, referred to the club exclusively as \\"Yankees\\" or \\"Yanks\\" throughout the article, with no mention at all of \\"Highlanders\\". The Times also consistently referred to the Hilltop by its formal name, \\"the American League Park\\". (The Complete Book of Baseball: A New York Times Scrapbook History, Arno Press, Bobbs-Merrill, 1980, p. 8) The Philadelphia Inquirer for a game of April 21, 1912, an exhibition between the two New York clubs, was headlined \\"Giants wallop Yanks\\", while in the article the teams were referred to as the \\"Nationals\\" and the \\"Giants\\"; and \\"the American League team\\", \\"Americans\\", and \\"Highlanders\\"; respectively. The New York Times for opening day 1912 reported that \\"The Yankees presented a natty appearance in their new uniforms of white with black pin stripes.\\" In 1913, the American Leaguers left the Hilltop after ten years, and began what would become a ten-year sub-lease with the Giants at the Polo Grounds. At that point the term \\"Highlanders\\" made no logical sense, and was dropped by the press. The club was exclusively the \\"Yankees\\" from then onward. It is uncertain exactly when the Yankees began referring to themselves by their popular nickname. By the time of Babe Ruth's arrival in 1920, the \\"Yankees\\" nickname was well established, but the name still did not appear on the uniforms. In fact, the Yankees have seldom carried their nickname on their uniforms. The only time was during 1927–1930, when the word \\"YANKEES\\" first appeared, in lieu of \\"NEW YORK\\" – on the road shirts. This was continued through the 1930 season, and then \\"NEW YORK\\" was restored to the road uniforms. (Okkonen) The name must have been considered 'official' at least by 1923, when the team named its new ballpark Yankee Stadium. The popular and successful Yankees have acquired many other unofficial nicknames through the years, such as the \\"Pinstripers\\" for obvious reasons, and jokingly as the \\"Evil Empire\\", a term originally applied to the Soviet Union by President Ronald Reagan. Probably the longest-lasting unofficial nickname has been the \\"Bronx Bombers\\", which was applied many decades ago in reference to the Yankees' power hitting, dating back to the Ruth era. One early newspaper usage came in July of 1928. Oakland The Pacific Coast League entry was typically called the Oakland Oaks (PCL) and sometimes the Acorns as an unofficial variant. Oakland A's The Oakland Athletics, who began in Philadelphia and resided in Kansas City for a few years, settled on the west coast in 1968. The nickname \\"Athletics\\" is among the oldest in baseball, dating to the early 1860s. Philadelphia Aside from the enduring teams called the \\"Athletics\\" and the \\"Phillies\\", other professional teams in Philadelphia over the years included the Philadelphia White Stockings (also sometimes called the \\"Pearls\\" or even the \\"Phillies\\"), who played in the National Association in the early 1870s in direct competition with the A's; and the Keystone club of the one-year Union Association experiment in 1884. Philadelphia Athletics First official use: 1901 In the peak of the amateur era of baseball in the 1860s, the strongest team in the Quaker State was the Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia, or just \\"Athletic\\" for short. Prior to the early 1900s, this club was typically always listed in standings as \\"Athletic\\" rather than \\"Philadelphia\\". When called the \\"Athletics\\" it was the pluralized style of the day, just as the National League entry would have been called the \\"Philadelphias\\". As early as 1866, the Athletics uniform shirts featured the stylized letter \\"A\\" that is still used by the team's nominal descendants today. The team had turned professional by the late 1860s, and continued playing through the first year of the National League in 1876, before disbanding. The team name \\"Athletic\\" was revived by the American Association, and again by the charter Philadelphia entry in the American League in 1901. The AL team was originally listed in the standings in the traditional way, \\"Athletic\\", but soon evolved into the \\"Philadelphia Athletics\\". Another enduring symbol of the team soon emerged: :\\"In 1902, John McGraw, then manager of the New York Giants, and bitter enemy of American League president Ban Johnson, gave out an interview belittling the entry of the American League in Philadelphia, and sarcastically referred to Ben Shibe and Connie Mack's club as a 'white elephant'. A Philadelphia newspaperman labeled the Athletics the White Elephants, and they went on to win the first of many flags.\\" (TSNBBG) The 1905 World Series pitted the Giants against the A's, and before the first game the A's captain presented a small white elephant toy to McGraw, photos capturing one of the few times McGraw was caught grinning. That \\"first of many flags\\" characterization, first written about 1940, was from a time when the A's were still thought of as winners or at least contenders. The team's decline, from the mid-1930s clear into the mid-1960s, would result in the franchise being transferred twice. The elephant logo first appeared on uniforms in 1918, and evolved into a circus elephant of varying colors, depending on the trim chosen for the uniform in a given year. As the team typically wore a stylized \\"A\\" on both their home and road shirts, and eventually on their caps, the nickname \\"A's\\" also arose. The first break with the \\"A\\" tradition came in 1920, when the team featured the elephant logo on shirts for the first time, displacing the \\"A\\", albeit in a dark blue. The elephant, worn as a badge of defiance following McGraw's remarks, had previously appeared on just the warmup weathers and then on the uniform sleeve. The elephant was changed to its titular white in 1924, and in 1928 the team went back to the traditional \\"A\\". (Okkonen) After owner Charles O. Finley moved the team to Oakland in 1968, he dropped \\"Athletics\\" and made \\"A's\\" the official team name. \\"Athletics\\" was restored in 1981. Philadelphia Phillies \\"They've been the Phillies ever since the team entered the National League in 1883.\\" (TSNBBG). \\"Phillies\\" or \\"Phils\\" is a short form of \\"Philadelphias\\", in the style of the 19th Century, when a city would be referred to by writers that way. The city itself is often called \\"Philly\\" for short. Other uses of that term include the Philly Cheesesteak and the popular Phillies Blunt cigar. \\"Phillies'\\" earliest appearance in the Spalding Guide was in 1894, in the context of \\"Bostons,\\" \\"Chicagos\\" etc. Bob Carpenter acquired the Phillies in the late fall of 1943. The following spring, a new name, \\"Blue Jays\\", was selected in a fans' contest. (TSNBBG) This change never caught on with the general public, especially as the uniform shirts continued to say \\"Phillies\\", albeit with a blue jay shoulder patch. That experiment was dropped after a couple of years. In 1900, the team's road shirts said \\"PHILA\\", a common abbreviation of \\"Philadelphia\\". The Phillies' uniforms otherwise carried only a simple block or stylized letter \\"P\\" for several decades. The first time the word \\"Phillies\\" appeared was 1933, in a script-style that has appeared frequently in the decades since then. 1942, the word \\"Phils\\" appeared on the road shirts and the block letter \\"P\\" re-appeared on the home shirts, just for the one season. The script \\"Phillies\\" continued until 1970 when, in anticipation of the move to Veterans Stadium, the team returned to a stylized letter \\"P\\" on their shirts. In 1992, the script \\"Phillies\\" was restored to the shirts. (Okkonen) Phoenix Prior to its entrance to the Major Leagues, Phoenix used several different nicknames for its ball clubs. They were first known as the Phoenix Senators, then the Phoenix Giants after their big league affiliate, and lastly the Phoenix Firebirds, for the mythologic bird synonymous with the city's name. Arizona Diamondbacks A Diamondback, specifically Crotalus atrox, is a rattlesnake which is a very common sight in the Arizona desert and a fearsome symbol. The club adopted the symbol upon its formation in 1998. A baseball field is also called a \\"diamond\\". The team is often called the \\"D-backs\\" for short, and as of 2007 the team is wearing shirts that read \\"D-backs\\". On the left sleeve is a stylized \\"db\\" which forms the head of a snake. Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Pirates The original Pittsburgh club, formed in 1882, was in the then-separate city of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, across the Allegheny River northwest of downtown Pittsburgh. Thus the club was called \\"Allegheny\\" in the standings, and in the style of the day, the \\"Alleghenys\\" (note that it was not \\"Alleghenies\\"). The Alleghenys played in the American Association during 1882–1886, then transferred to the National League in 1887. However, out-of-town newspapers tended to list the team as \\"Pittsburg\\" (as it was often spelled at the time) rather than \\"Allegheny.\\" The club wore \\"Pittsburgh\\" (variously spelled with or without the final h) on its uniforms by 1890, although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. The club was accused of \\"pirating\\" Lou Bierbauer in the Players' League settlement following the 1890 season, which led to their nickname. This fact is a detail of the larger story of what was happening in professional baseball around that time. In 1888, baseball owners established rules to categorize players and pay them according to rank. Since the owners set the categories themselves, their new system at first lowered, and then eventually froze players salaries. Shortly before this, in 1885, John Montgomery Ward, a current Major League pitcher and Columbia Law School graduate, had founded the \\"Brotherhood of Base Ball Players\\" an association to protect and promote players interests. Baseball owners had instituted their new rules in the off-season without talking with the players, and this led to a rift between them and the players. Despite yearlong efforts to negotiate with the owners over these new restrictions on players, Ward could not get them to bargain or even recognize the Brotherhood. Players revolted and in 1890 they started a new league called the Players' League. The Players' League was spearheaded by Ward, who not only gained financial backers, but he also solicited star players to jump from the National League and American Association to the new league. With three professional leagues competing, many in the same cities, there was not enough revenue to go around, and each league lost money. Although the Players' League's attendance was the best of the three leagues, it folded after one year. The financially hemorrhaging American Association folded one year later, and the National League absorbed four of its teams. In 1890, Philadelphia Athletics players Lou Bierbauer and Harry Stovey had jumped to the Players' League. After the Players' League collapsed, through a clerical error the Athletics had failed to reserve Bierbauer's and Stovey's services. Pittsburgh signed Bierbauer and Stovey to contracts. The Athletics protested losing these players, and this led to an impartial Arbitration Board, which included American Association President Allan W. Thurman. The board ruled in Pittsburgh's favor. Despite the ruling, the Athletics still grumbled at the decision, and ridiculed their cross-state rivals by calling them \\"Pirates\\" for \\"stealing\\" their players. The \\"Pirates\\" tag stuck and the alliterative name was eventually adopted as Pittsburgh's official team nickname.\\"Baseball Biographical Encyclopedia\\" (2000) Total Sports PublishingThe Spalding Guide was using \\"Pirates\\" occasionally by its 1894 edition. By the time of the 1903 World Series, the team (officially the Pittsburgh Athletic Companyhttps://www.baseball- almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml) was commonly known as \\"Pirates\\", and represented in cartoons by a pirate figure, although the club did not acknowledge it on their uniforms until 1912. Alternate nicknames such as \\"Bucs\\" or \\"Buccos\\", short for \\"buccaneer\\", have been used through the years. \\"Buccaneer\\" is typically used synonymously with \\"pirate\\", although historically \\"buccaneer\\" is a more specific term for pirates who operated in the Caribbean, especially along the Spanish Main coast. :\\"No Smoky City club ever had a nickname until 1890. Then the team, which lost 113 games while winning only 23, was tagged the Innocents — apparently being innocent of victorious aspirations. In 1890, during the off-season, Pittsburgh owners signed second baseman Louis Bierbauer, whom the bankrupt Athletic club of Philadelphia had forgotten to reserve. The Pittsburgh club became known as the Pirates, in reference to so-called \\"pirating\\" of players.\\" (TSNBBG) The Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL began as the Pittsburgh Pirates, in reference to the baseball team from which they rented Forbes Field in their early years. There was also a short-lived NHL entry from 1925–1930 called the Pittsburgh Pirates. St. Louis In the National Association of 1875, St. Louis fielded two entries, called the St. Louis Brown Stockings (or Browns); and the St. Louis Red Stockings, (or Reds). The Reds did not survive the season. The Browns were better organized and were carried forward into the new National League in 1876. The club abandoned League ball after the 1877 season due to a betting scandal, but continued to play as an independent semipro team. The St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association in 1884, and the NL in 1885–1886, continued the reddish color scheme during their brief tenure. For the 1886 season they wore uniforms sporting a large black diamond shape on the chest, and some reporters referred to them as the \\"Black Diamonds\\" that year. In 1887 they decamped for Indianapolis, where they played three losing seasons before folding. The St. Louis Terriers of the Federal League of 1914–1915 were the only major league club in St. Louis that eschewed being named for a color. St. Louis Cardinals The old Browns were bought by St. Louis grocery magnate Chris von der Ahe in 1882 and became a charter member of the American Association. The team continued with brown stockings and trim, and was one of the most successful in the AA's ten-year existence under the leadership of 1st baseman/captain Charles Comiskey, and was carried forward into the NL in 1892. In 1893 their jerseys were blazoned \\"St. Louis Browns\\" (in white, on navy blue uniforms; only their belts and socks were brown). In 1899, the club decided it was time for a makeover. They rebuilt the stands at Robison Field after a fire; they stripped the Cleveland Spiders of their star players, hoping to take a major leap in the standings; and, according to most sources, changed their uniform color that year, from brown to red. The refreshed team was labeled the Perfectos by a perhaps over-optimistic press. The team jumped from twelfth to fifth, rather short of its lofty goal. The team was also being called Cardinals by season's end. According to TSNBBG, it was William McHale, baseball writer for the St. Louis Republic, who dubbed the red-trimmed team the St. Louis Cardinals. By 1900, that name was in universal usage, and they have been known by that nickname to this day. The term \\"Cardinal\\" for both the bird and the color originated from the traditional vestments of the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church. The red-trimmed uniforms at first were only labeled \\"ST. LOUIS\\", on both home and road shirts, later replaced by the familiar interlocking \\"StL\\" logo. The word \\"Cardinals\\" first appeared on both home and road shirts in 1918. The term went from just being a color to also being a symbol in 1922, with the first incarnation of the two Cardinal birds perched on a bat across the word \\"Cardinals\\". (Okkonen) The synonym \\"Redbirds\\" and the abbreviation \\"Cards\\" are also in broad usage today. The St. Louis Cardinals of the NFL transferred from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960, and from St. Louis to Phoenix in 1988. The Football Cardinals were not named after the Baseball Cardinals, but for the same reason that the Baseball Cardinals acquired their name — from the color of their jerseys, which were originally hand-me-downs from the University of Chicago Maroons. St. Louis Browns The nickname St. Louis Browns was revived in 1902 by the AL entry that transferred from Milwaukee. Moving from one major brewing city to another, they could have retained the nickname \\"Brewers\\", but for marketing reasons they chose to adopt the recently abandoned colors of their established rival. The Browns were the better team in the Mound City for the first 25 years or so of their co-existence, but the Cardinals returned to winning form in the mid-1920s and the Browns struggled after that. The club was looking for a city to transfer to in the early 1950s. They considered coincidentally returning to their roots in Milwaukee, but the Braves beat them to it. They settled for a move to Baltimore in 1954, where they were renamed the \\"Orioles\\", ending the life of the \\"Browns\\" nickname. Although known from the beginning as the \\"Browns\\", and wearing brown trim most of the time (except for 1906 when they experimented with all-black trim), the club did not wear the word \\"BROWNS\\" on their shirts until 1934. (Okkonen) The team had various logos. In the early years they had an interlaced \\"StL\\", as with the Cardinals. In the 1930s, they began wearing a patch featuring an illustration of the famous statue of the royal Saint. In 1952 they began wearing a sleeve patch with a cartoon face of a \\"Brownie\\". The Cleveland Browns of the NFL have no connection to the St. Louis Browns, although their color scheme (orange and brown) and their use of a \\"Brownie\\" coincide. San Diego San Diego Padres The minor league team called the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League operated during 1936–1968. The name Padre was taken from the Spanish word for \\"Father\\", a term of respect used for Spanish missionaries; San Diego was founded as a mission by Franciscan friars. When Major League Baseball expanded to San Diego in 1969, the old nickname was retained for the new team. The team is frequently called the \\"Pads\\" or \\"Pods\\" in the media, which rhymes with the first syllable of \\"PAHD-rays\\". \\"Friars\\" has also been a longtime team nickname. San Francisco The San Francisco Seals operated from the inception of the Pacific Coast League in 1903 through 1957. The name \\"Seals\\" was revived by a professional hockey team in 1961 which eventually became the California Golden Seals before departing the Bay Area. A second, shorter-lived club was the Mission Reds, who played in San Francisco during 1925–1937. They were sometimes called the \\"Missions\\". San Francisco Giants The well- established Seals, which had once been Joe DiMaggio's team, moved after the 1957 season to make way for the arrival of the New York Giants, who followed the Dodgers from the east coast. The San Francisco Giants have lived up to their name, with sluggers like Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Barry Bonds rocketing baseballs out of the San Francisco ballparks just as Mays and Mel Ott did in New York. Seattle The original Pacific Coast League minor league club in Seattle was initially called the Indians, due to the Native American legacy of the area. The team was later named the Seattle Rainiers, directly in reference to the Rainier Brewing Company, and indirectly in reference to Mount Rainier, for which the brewery was named. The Rainiers operated through 1968, when the major leagues expanded. After the one-year major league experiment, a new Rainiers ball club was formed and played during 1972–1976, when the majors were ready to try Seattle again. Since 1995, the Rainiers name has been used by the Seattle Mariners' Triple-A affiliate in nearby Tacoma. Seattle Pilots The AL expansion team in 1969 was named in reference to the prominence of marine activities in the Puget Sound area, primarily after ship pilots who guide large ships into the ports of Puget Sound. The caps even featured the \\"scrambled eggs\\" golden-leaf symbol of a ship's captain. The ambitious but underfunded club sank in a sea of red ink, and became the first major league club since the 1901 Milwaukee Brewers to switch cities after one year. Ironically, the Pilots moved to Milwaukee, and became the new Milwaukee Brewers. Seattle Mariners The AL again expanded to Seattle, in 1977, with the formation of the Seattle Mariners. The nickname again alluded to fishing and other marine activities. The Mariners have been in Seattle for over 40 years with no indications of leaving anytime soon. Tampa Bay Area Several minor league teams played in the Tampa Bay area prior to the introduction of the American League ball club in 1998. Named after the local cigar industry, the Tampa Smokers existed in several leagues from 1919 until 1954. Also bearing the Tampa city name were the Tampa Tarpons who existed from 1957 until 1988, and were named after the Atlantic-native fish. The St. Petersburg Saints, who were named as such because of their city name, played mostly in the Florida State League from 1920 until 1928 and again from 1947 until 2000. Other teams still exist in the area including a new iteration of the Tampa Tarpons and the Dunedin Blue Jays (named after their MLB affiliate), the Clearwater Threshers (after the thresher shark), the Bradenton Marauders (a nod to their MLB affiliate, the Pittsburgh Pirates), and the Lakeland Flying Tigers, who similarly named as a nod to their MLB affiliate, the Detroit Tigers. Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays The club was an expansion franchise in the American League in 1998. The team's logo included an illustration of a manta ray, also called a devilfish or devil ray. The team was also called the D-rays or the Rays for short. As of 2007, one version of their home uniforms said \\"Rays\\", and no version said \\"Devil Rays\\", although a patch illustrating a manta ray was used. On November 8, 2007, the club announced that they were dropping the \\"Devil\\" part in order to identify themselves primarily with the rays of the sun, Florida being the Sunshine State, and their redesigned logo reflects that theme. As noted in the MLB article the club stated that they would continue using the manta ray patch as an acknowledgment of their previous identity – a feature easily visible on their uniforms in the super-closeups used by television in the 2008 World Series, as the former league doormats turned into the American League's champion team in 2008. The club would also retain its furry mascot, called \\"Raymond\\", strictly for humorous reasons, as that name has no etymological connection to either the old or the new usage of \\"ray\\". Toronto The original minor league club in Toronto was the Toronto Maple Leafs, which operated from 1896 through 1967 in the International League. The National Hockey League club renamed itself the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927 and has been known by that name ever since. Toronto Blue Jays By the time the American League expanded to Toronto in 1977, the NHL club's strong identification as the Maple Leafs precluded any chance of reviving that name for the baseball team. The Toronto franchise was originally owned by Labatt Breweries, with Imperial Trust and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as minority owners. The name Toronto Blue Jays came about when former Ontario Premier John Robarts, a member of the team's board of directors, started talking about a morning routine: \\"I was shaving this morning and I saw a blue jay out my window.\\" \\"Blue\\" was also the top-selling brand of beer sold by Labatt's, providing an on-air opportunity for TV commentators to take a microscopic pause when saying \\"You're watching Labatt's Blue...Jays baseball on CBC.\\" The short form \\"Jays\\" has been used extensively for much of the team's history. Coincidentally, the nickname \\"Blue Jays\\" was used briefly by the Philadelphia Phillies (the team that Toronto beat in the 1993 World Series), from 1944 to 1945. Washington, D.C. Baseball clubs in Washington, D.C. have been known by a variety of nicknames since the first professional teams appeared in 1870. One team was called the \\"Olympics\\", another was called the \\"Nationals\\". Both of those names persisted through the 1870s. Later teams in the 19th Century were called the \\"Nationals\\" and also obvious other Capital City nicknames such as \\"Statesmen\\" and \\"Senators\\". By the 1890s, \\"Senators\\" was commonly used in the media for the National League entry, and it appears in the 1894 Spalding Guide. Washington Nationals/Senators The \\"Senators\\" nickname carried over to the new American League entry in 1901. The team was generally called the Senators from 1901–04, as the old National League club had been. Washington Star newspaper owner Thomas C. Noyes, along with an ownership group of Benjamin Minor, Harry Rapley and others bought the team in 1905. Before the 1905 season, Noyes solicited fans and writers for a new nickname. In an effort to remarket the team Noyes decided to officially name the club the \\"Nationals\\", reverting to the older nickname. :\\"The new owners desire to get as far away as possible from the old regime and start the coming season without any barnacles to hinder its move toward prosperity. With that end in view it is proposed to bury the moss-covered title of Senators and secure a nickname that may be lucky and popular.\\" – Tom Noyes, 1905 During 1905 and 1906, the team wore \\"Nationals\\" on their new shirts, the first team to wear a full team name. Otherwise, the shirts either read \\"Washington\\" or carried a plain block \\"W\\". (Okkonen) :\\"Fans, by ballot, decided their club was to be called the Nationals, instead of the Senators. The only trouble with the vote was that its result was not binding on headline writers. Therefore, the Washington club still is often called Senators, as well as the Nats and Griffs, the latter nickname being derived from the name of owner Clark Calvin Griffith.\\" (TSNBBG) Some reluctance could have been due to the inherent ambiguity of the name. Writers frequently referred to individual major league teams as \\"Americans\\" or \\"Nationals\\" in reference to their league affiliation—and the Washington Nationals were in the American League. Newspaper articles for decades used the names \\"Senators\\" and \\"Nationals\\" (or \\"Nats\\") interchangeably, often within the same article. Baseball guides even said \\"Nationals or Senators\\" when listing the nickname. This was long before teams made nicknames registered trademarks for marketing purposes. Thus the Washington ballclub was known by two nicknames for most of its history prior to moving to Minnesota. Although there have been other teams with dual nicknames, such as the Brooklyn \\"Robins\\"/\\"Dodgers\\", or the New York \\"Highlanders\\"/\\"Yankees\\", the longevity of this dual nickname was unique. The nickname \\"Senators\\" was kept alive especially by out-of-town writers. World Series programs in the same year referred to the team by different names: In 1933, the programs for the games played in New York City advertised \\"Giants vs. Senators\\", while programs for the games played in Washington included a photo of Washington manager Joe Cronin with the caption \\"Nationals' Manager\\". Although \\"Nationals\\" or \\"Nats\\" was still used on baseball cards issued by Topps as late as 1956, by the 1950s, the name \\"Nationals\\" was pretty much passé. For example, the popular 1955 Broadway musical Damn Yankees referred to the club primarily, if not exclusively, as the \\"Senators\\". Following the 1956 season, owner Calvin Griffith decided to officially change the name to Senators, but it wasn't until 1959 that the word \\"Senators\\" finally appeared on their shirts. (Okkonen) They and their expansion-replacement in 1961 would remain officially the \\"Senators\\" for good, although space-saving headline writers continued to refer to them as \\"Nats\\" frequently. Washington Nationals The Washington Nationals of the National League, transplanted from the Montreal Expos in 2005, revived the old Nationals name, and with modern marketing techniques it appears the name will stick this time. The time-honored headline abbreviation \\"Nats\\" has also been revived. Any possibility of using the name \\"Washington Senators\\" was prohibited by the Texas Rangers still owning the rights to that trademark. Although there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators, political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise's \\"official\\" nickname used from 1905 to 1956. Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting representation in Congress. Although the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name, the Nationals were able to acquire the rights to the curly \\"W\\" from the Rangers.

A STANAG magazine or NATO magazine is a type of detachable firearm magazine proposed by NATO in October 1980. Shortly after NATO's acceptance of the 5.56×45mm NATO rifle cartridge, Draft Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 4179 was proposed in order to allow NATO members to easily share rifle ammunition and magazines down to the individual soldier level. The U.S. M16 rifle's magazine proportions were proposed for standardization. Many NATO members, but not all, subsequently developed or purchased rifles with the ability to accept this type of magazine. However the standard was never ratified and remains a \\"Draft STANAG\\". Magazines The STANAG magazine concept is only an interface, dimensional and controls (magazine latch, bolt stop, etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines to be made in various configurations and capacities. The standard capacities of STANAG-compatible magazines are 20 or 30 rounds of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. There are also 5-, 10-, 40- and 50-round box magazines, as well as 60- and 100-round casket magazines, 90-round snail-drum magazines, and 100-round drum magazines.The Gun Digest Book of the AR-15.

Note: clear viewing window The STANAG magazine, while relatively compact compared to other types of 5.56×45mm NATO box magazines, has often been criticized for a perceived lack of durability and a tendency to malfunction unless treated with a level of care that often cannot be afforded under combat conditions. Because STANAG 4179 is only a dimensional standard, production quality from manufacturer to manufacturer is not uniform. Magazines have been manufactured with lightweight aluminum or plastic bodies and other inexpensive materials in order to keep costs down, or to meet requirements that treat the magazine more as a disposable piece of equipment than one that is supposed to stand up to repeated combat use. As a result, in March 2009, the U.S. military began to accept delivery of improved STANAG magazines.Brownells shipping M16 magazines with anti-tilt follower to military - The Firearm Blog, June 13, 2009 To increase reliability, these magazines incorporate heavier, more corrosion resistant springs and new tan-colored anti-tilt followers.New US Army M16 “Tan” Magazine - The Firearm Blog, December 16, 2009 In addition, many commercial magazine manufacturers now offer improved STANAG-compatible magazines. These magazines are made from high-grade stainless steel bodies, rust- and set-resistant chrome-silicon springs, and anti-tilt followers. There are also highly reliable polymer magazines, some with view windows, others are translucent.

It is endemic to Colombia, and its natural habitats are tropical highly humid forests; it has also been reported from a coffee plantation. The greatest threat posed to this species is habitat loss, however they are currently nowhere near the risk of extinction. The species' name honors Antoine Rouhaire (Brother Nicéforo María), a French naturalist who collected the species holotype. Description B. nicefori have webbed hands and feet with no ventral pads on their digits. They are reddish brown with irregular pale blotches dorsally and brown with irregular cream markings ventrally. They range in size from 29 to 77 mm SVL. Adult females are generally larger than males. Habitat The general habitat for B. nicefori consists of various locations throughout the East Andes of Colombia including the municipalities of Piedecuesta (Micro-cuenca La Venta, and Vereda la Amarillas) and Los Santos (Hacienda El Roble) in Santander department. They are found on the western slopes of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental between the elevations of 1400 m and 2400 m. This highly disturbed tropical forest habitat has an average rainfall per year of 1160 mm and an average temperature of 17.36 °C. This species inhabits both arboreal and terrestrial sites. The majority of them (85%) have been found on herbaceous plants such as coffee plants of large plantations in Colombian municipalities. Preovulatory and pregnant females exclusively inhabit the leaf litter between January and March. Diet Their diet consists of a wide range of arthropods. Their most prominent prey are ants, beetles, and larval flies. In rare cases, small traces of vegetation have been found in their stomachs. They either actively hunt or 'sit and wait' to catch their prey. Overall their hunting has only a small effect on even their most prominent food source species. Reproduction Males of B. nicefori are capable of sexual activity year round, continually undergoing spermatogenesis. Females on the other hand reproduce seasonally between the dry months of April and June. \\"Eggs are laid and brooded during the dry season, and hatchlings emerge during the rainy season when moisture is favorable to growth and dispersal.\\" Climate, microhabitat, and availability and abundance of resources can all have an effect on this process. Females produce one clutch (eggs) per year, consisting of anywhere between 20-50 eggs, and matings occur around the same general time of egg-laying. The population exhibits strong sexual dimorphism in body size between male and female B. nicefori. Males reach a standard length of 29–50 mm at maturation, whereas females are considerably larger reaching a standard length of 39–75 mm. The overall time it takes for these salamanders to completely mature is thought to be approximately 6 years.

A development of the Eclipse 500, the Eclipse 400 was cancelled when the company went bankrupt in 2008 and development has not been pursued by Eclipse Aerospace, the company that bought Eclipse Aviation's assets. Design and development The Eclipse 400 was first publicly unveiled on 23 July 2007 at AirVenture as the Eclipse Concept Jet (ECJ). The aircraft was intended to compete with the Cirrus Vision SF50, the Piper PA-47 PiperJet, the Epic Victory, and the Diamond D-Jet in the single-engine jet market. The Eclipse 400 design featured one engine, four seats and a V-tail similar to the Cirrus Jet. The four-seat prototype, registered N5184U, is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney Canada PW610F turbofan, first flown on 2 July 2007. It was built in complete secrecy at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia by Swift Engineering, BaySys Technologies. The prototype aircraft has 60% parts commonality with its larger Eclipse 500 sibling. At the time of its announcement the company said that the aircraft would have an expected cruise speed of at with an IFR range of . The aircraft was designed for a gross weight, empty weight, useful load and a fuel capacity of . When the prototype was initially unveiled the company said that it did not intend to produce the aircraft. Eclipse CEO Vern Raburn said: On 30 May 2008, Eclipse Aviation began taking orders for a production version of the ECJ, the Eclipse 400. The 400 was at that time priced at $1.35 million and deliveries were expected to begin by the fourth quarter in 2011. At AirVenture in July 2008, new Eclipse CEO Roel Pieper confirmed that if sufficient orders were placed for the 400, production would commence in 2011. Pieper also stated: \\"If there's not sufficient interest we'll give their (deposits) back...The 400 will get a very specific program. It will not be allowed to influence the 500 in any way.\\" In August 2008 in a communication to position holders, the company indicated that development of the Eclipse 400 was on hold. In October 2008 when asked \\"if the Eclipse 400 project was a go or not, Eclipse said it has not begun the certification process. The company also said it has not spent any of the deposit money for the four-place, single-engine VLJ.\\"Over and Out Inc, et al: In the United States Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware - Complaint Case 08-13031 (MFW), page 5. In October 2008 industry analysts The Teal Group and Forecast International both issued independent analyses indicating that Eclipse faced bankruptcy by the end of the first quarter of 2009 and this development was expected to terminate development of the Eclipse 400. Eclipse Aviation entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 25 November 2008. Even though the purchase agreements for Eclipse 400s stated that the US$100,000 deposit was refundable upon request anytime before November 2009, reports in December 2008 indicated that deposits were not refunded upon request and that the company did not return phone calls on the subject. Court documents filed by Eclipse 400 position holders as part of the bankruptcy hearings allege that the company misappropriated the US$3.2M collected from depositors, did not escrow it as contracted to do so and refused to refund it when required to. The assets of the company were sold to EclipseJet Aviation International by court order on 23 January 2009 and the fate of the deposits became the subject of an adversarial court action at that time. The sale to EclipseJet was not completed and the company entered Chapter 7 liquidation, the company assets, including the Eclipse 400 prototype, going to Eclipse Aerospace.

Originally developed as a stand-alone project, Installwatch now exists primarily as a component of CheckInstall. Installwatch was originally written by Pancrazio 'Ezio' de Mauro in 1998, but development was later taken over by Felipe Sánchez. Functionality Installwatch allows the user to monitor what files and directories are created during the installation of a software package in real-time. This allows the user to know exactly what has been installed on their system for the purposes of documentation and later removal of the software. When used on its own Installwatch is of limited usefulness, as it can only create a log of the installation process. Because of this, Felipe Sánchez created CheckInstall; which takes the information generated by Installwatch and uses it to create an installable package which can be used on any Linux distribution that makes use of Debian, Slackware, or Red Hat package management systems. The use of CheckInstall has largely superseded that of Installwatch alone, and as such Installwatch has now been merged with the CheckInstall distribution. Older stand-alone versions of Installwatch still remain primarily for historical and educational purposes. Coreutils incompatibility At present, the version of Installwatch packaged with CheckInstall is incompatible with the current version of the GNU coreutils (Core Utilities). Because of this, Installwatch can't monitor any changes made with the coreutils, rendering its logs incomplete. Depending on the software package, this may completely invalidate the information provided by Installwatch and thus any program that depends on it (such as CheckInstall). This issue was documented in the Slackware 12 changelog, and prompted CheckInstall's removal from that distribution. On August 3, 2007, the problem was further explained and detailed by Felipe Sánchez on the CheckInstall mailing list. An updated version of CheckInstall is promised to be coming soon which will address the issue, and in the meantime a workaround is suggested.

It is endemic to Honduras and is known from the summit of Cerro El Zarciadero (its type locality) and the southwestern side of the nearby Cerro Azul Meámbar National Park, in the northern Comayagua Department. Description The type series consists of two adult females measuring in snout–vent length (SVL) and in total length. A subadult female measured SVL. The snout is truncate in dorsal aspect and rounded in profile. The tail is strongly constricted basally. The limbs are relatively slender and long; the digits are moderately webbed. The upper parts are grayish brown or brownish olive with small, inconspicuous, irregularly shaped buff-yellow spots. The ventral surface is uniformly buff-yellow (holotype) or brownish olive with buff-yellow blotches (paratype). Habitat and conservation The species inhabits cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. Specimens have been found in water-containing arboreal bromeliads, active on vegetation at night, in a standing, rotten tree trunk about 1 metre above the ground during the daytime, and in moist leaf litter during the morning. The type locality is a small patch of forest (<1 ha) on a mountain top, completely surrounded by crop fields. Habitat loss may further threaten this population by leading to drying of the environment. Also use of the pesticides in the surrounding area is a potential threat. Fortunately, in 2008 the species was found inside the Cerro Azul Meámbar National Park, some from the type locality.

The mission of CalEPA is to restore, protect and enhance the environment, to ensure public health, environmental quality and economic vitality. The current Secretary for Environmental Protection (Secretary of CalEPA) is Jared Blumenfeld, and is a member of Governor Gavin Newsom's cabinet. The Office of the Secretary heads CalEPA and is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities of one office, two boards, and three departments dedicated to improving California’s environment. The Secretary of CalEPA is also directly responsible for coordinating the administration of the Unified Program and certifying Unified Program Agencies. The CalEPA Unified Program coordinates, and makes consistent the administrative requirements, permits, inspections, and enforcement activities of six environmental and emergency response programs. The state agencies responsible for these programs set the standards for their program while local governments implement the standards. To date, there are 83 Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPAs), who are accountable for carrying out responsibilities previously handled by approximately 1,300 different state and local agencies. CalEPA should not be confused with the similarly named federal United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). History CalEPA was created by Governor Pete Wilson by Executive Order W-5-91 in 1991, following on a \\"Big Green\\" initiative Wilson proposed during the 1990 state gubernatorial elections, promising a cabinet-level agency to oversee state environmental regulations and research. Following inter-agency reorganizations led by the governor with review by both houses of the California State Legislature, the agency became a cabinet department on July 17, 1991. As of 2019, the statutory creation of the agency is in Government Code section 12800. CalEPA, and its departmental California Air Resources Board, were one of the key supporters of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, making the state the first in the United States to cap all greenhouse gas emissions from major industries. In June 2008, CalEPA announced that new global warming performance labels would be placed on all new cars effective on January 1, 2009. The stickers will provide two scores: a smog score and a global warming score with a grade from 1 to 10, where the higher the grade, the more environmentally friendly the vehicle.

A popular song about him, The Ballad Of Johnny Ramensky, was written by Labour MP Norman Buchan and recorded by singer Enoch Kent, Buchan's brother-in-law. Though a career criminal, Ramensky received the nickname \\"Gentle Johnny\\" as he never used violence when being apprehended by the police.  Early life  Ramensky was born Jonas Ramanauckas (Jonas Ramanauskas), the son of Lithuanian immigrant parents, at Glenboig, a mining village in North Lanarkshire, near Coatbridge. He initially worked down the coal mines, similar to his father who had been a clay miner, and it was there he became familiar with the uses of dynamite. During the depression of the 1920s following the First World War Ramensky's family moved to the Gorbals, in the south side of Glasgow, after the death of his father. Criminal career Throughout his life, Ramensky demonstrated great strength and gymnastic skill which he used to begin a career as a burglar, followed by graduating to safe-cracking, also known in the underworld as a Peterman. During his criminal career, Ramensky maintained that he never targeted individuals' houses but only businesses and he became famous for never resorting to violence despite being arrested numerous times, resulting in the nickname \\"Gentleman (or Gentle) Johnny\\". Detective Superintendent Robert Colquhoun, one of his old adversaries, when taken ill, was sent a message by Ramensky wishing him a speedy recovery, suggesting he had been working too hard in pursuing him. Having been denied a licence to attend his wife's funeral, Ramnesky began another series of feats which led to part of his fame. Ramensky was the last man to be shackled in a Scottish prison cell, as well as the first to escape from Peterhead Prison, going on to escape and being ultimately recaptured a further four times. He spent more than 40 of his 67 years in prison.The Scotsman  Military  Ramensky was released after serving a sentence in Peterhead Prison in 1943. During his time there he had written to various officials seeking references to join the army. Due to the intervention of a senior police officer from Aberdeen he had attracted the interest of Robert Laycock who was seeking people with skills which could be used in commando raiding forces. As a result, he was enlisted with the Royal Fusiliers in January 1943 and transferred immediately to the Commandos, where he was trained as a soldier whilst also instructing on the use of explosives. Although being officially enlisted with the Royal Fusiliers he never actually served with them, spending his entire wartime service with the 30 Commando.https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/waleshistory/2010/11/dennis_whitcombe_war_veteran_james_bond.html Ramensky, using his safe-blowing skills, performed a number of sabotage missions, being parachuted behind enemy lines to retrieve documents from Axis headquarters, including Rommel's headquarters in North Africa and Hermann Göring's Carinhall in the Schorfheide. This culminated during the Italian campaign, where 14 embassy strong boxes or safes were opened in only one day. He remained in the army after the cessation of hostilities as a translator for the allied forces who were repatriating approximately 70,000 Lithuanians from camps in the Lübeck area. Following this, he had a short spell as an officer's batman before being demobbed in 1946. Death Ramensky did not give up his safe-cracking lifestyle and spent the time after the war in and out of jail, eventually dying in Perth Royal Infirmary after suffering a stroke in Perth Prison, where he was serving a one-year sentence after being caught on a shop roof in Ayr. Hidden loot Ramensky's friend Sonny Leitch, also a career criminal who served in the armed forces, said that Ramensky told him that he had stolen a hoard of Nazi loot from the Rome area during the Allied march on Rome in 1944, and that this hoard was later kept at the Shepton Mallet military prison in Somerset, and the Royal Navy supply depot at Carfin, Lanarkshire, after the war. He claimed that the hoard contained portraits of Hitler, Eva Braun, Goering, Goebbels and Himmler, and a treasure trove of jewellery and gold. Although this was never proven, there were certain looted items of little monetary value which survived him and remain, along with personal items, in a vault in a Glasgow bank. These include banners from Goering's Carinhall, and Ramensky's commando beret, compass and commando knife. During his wartime service Ramensky was also known to have sent various items looted from German and Italian targets to friends and associates in Scotland, including the governor of Peterhead Prison.

Description Bolitoglossa pandi was described based on a single specimen, the holotype, which is an adult female that measured in snout–vent length (SVL). Individuals from a population in Supatá measured SVL; females were significantly larger than males. Acosta-Galvis and Gutiérrez-Lamus (2012) give size range SVL for mature females. Habitat, ecology, and conservation The species' natural habitats are moist montane forests at elevations of above sea level. Salamanders from a population in Supatá were observed foraging on shrubs and perched on leaves at night. During the day, they were found hiding in the leaf litter and in the axils of bromeliads. Adults we perched on taller plants than juveniles. Their diet consisted of arthropods, in particular mites, beetles, and ants. Bolitoglossa pandi is an uncommon species that is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by agriculture (both cultivation of crops and livestock farming). The habitat is severely fragmented. The Supatá population lives in a small protected area.

A native of Chicago, Richard Newhafer was a student at Loyola Academy, the University of Notre Dame, and DePaul University. In his early twenties at the start of World War II, he became a Naval Aviator, took part in extensive military operations and was credited with downing three Japanese planes and participated in sinking the battleship Ise. During the Korean War, he again served in the navy and, in 1954-55, he was public affairs officer of the Blue Angels, the Navy's prestigious flight demonstration team. When television producer Samuel Gallu requested a technical advisor for The Blue Angels, his 1960 syndicated series portraying the team's fictional exploits, The Pentagon assigned Richard Newhafer. Having earned over thirty medals, decorations and citations, Newhafer resigned from the Navy and remained in Hollywood, becoming a writer of war novels and teleplays and subsequently directing a number of episodes for the 1964-67 World War II series Twelve O'Clock High. Among his books were The Last Tallyho (1964, G. P. Putnam's Sons), No More Bugles in the Sky (1966, New American Library), The Violators (1967, New American Library), The Golden Jungle (1968), On the Wings of the Storm (1969, William Morrow and Company) and Seven Days to Glory (1973). He also authored stories which were published in men's action magazines such as Flying and Air Navy and, in his final years, expanded into the detective genre, writing episodes for the early seasons of CBS' Cannon, a 1971-76 series which, following Twelve O'Clock High, continued his association with Quinn Martin Productions.

It is found in the Atlantic slopes of Meso-America from San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and northern Chiapas in Mexico continuing on to the southern part of Guatemala, Belize, and northern Honduras. However, its range south of Mexico is uncertain because the records may refer to other species. Description and ecology  The northern banana salamanders are small terrestrial, arboreal salamanders. Their size ranges from snout–vent length and total length. It dwells in tropical and subtropical moist lowland rain forests and mountain ecosystems, as well as in citrus orchards, banana plantations, and pine plantations. Predominantly found in bromeliads in tropical and subtropical wet forests. B.rufescens is dorsally pale brown to tan brown in color and on paler species it may consist of dorsal longitudinal streaks or specks. The ventral area in most species is grey or paler than the dorsal color, in some the coloring might be uniform. A dark brown streaks usually runs from behind the eyes and extend towards is posterior, it may go as far as half the length of the body or farther. Northern banana salamanders are rather small in size when compared to other salamanders in the genus Bolitoglossa such as the O'Donnell's salamander (Bolitoglossa odonnelli) which are longer in length. The northern banana salamander has a robust body with ll costal grooves running longitudinally between its legs and 3 additional costal grooves in between their limbs. This grooves assist salamanders in water transportation, enhances respiration and aids in thermo-regulation. They possess webbed fingers and toes, with 4 digits on its front limb and 5 digits on its hind limbs. Its snout is truncate and slightly projected on its anterior dorsal view. This species are lungless salamanders, they lack lungs and breath entirely through their skin and lining of their mouth. Diet Salamanders mostly feed on small invertebrates found on forest floors. Diet is influenced by size and micro-habitat of the salamander. Bolitoglossa rufescens are small and strictly arboreal, research shows that their diet is comprised significantly of ants followed by beetles and weevils (Coleoptera), collembolans, and arachnids. Behavior Snakes are major predators of salamanders they sense their prey by flickering their tongue in the air or by direct contact with prey or substrates. Anti-predator behavior studies show that Bolitoglossa rufescens responds more often to predator attacks that involved stimulation to the head other than its tail or trunk area. It responds by elevating or elevating and undulating its tail. Reproduction The northern banana salamanders reproduce biennially. Internal fertilization takes place after successful courtship, where the male salamander during the breeding season develops an enlarge courtship gland used to stimulate the female. The female picks up egg packets from substratum through cloaca. After fertilization eggs are laid on moist places on land. These salamanders have an average clutch size of 13.5 and an average egg diameter of 1.9 mm. Eggs develop entirely on land, and direct development occurs. Sexual dimorphism is minimal between males and females of this species.

There is no final conclusion to the issue so far, and part of the research planned for the European Drilling Research Icebreaker (Aurora Borealis) was drilling of the Alpha Ridge to collect more data.

It stars Judd Nelson, Devon Sawa, Tom Arnold and Joey Lauren Adams. The story revolves around a police detective investigating a photo of a female victim who is gagged and restrained to a tree, which is found inside a car involved in a fatal car crash. Plot Police detective Emory Lane (Judd Nelson) is called in to investigate when gagged 29-year-old hostage, Daphne Mayton (Clare Kramer), is left in the woods and restrained to a tree late at night; her perpetrator 47-year-old Douglas Macey (Tyler Cravens) is killed in a car accident afterwards. At the crash site, the accident leaves traces, including a photo of a gagged Daphne in front of a tree, a Polaroid camera, blood stains, a cellphone and keys, which are found inside the car. Captain Ted Stillman (Dennis Neal) of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement pairs Emory with rookie detective Zeth Arnold (Devon Sawa) to work on the case. They all realize it will be a grueling search for the victim due to the acres of land she was left within. Simultaneously, Emory's wife Sirena Lane (Joey Lauren Adams) suffers from a severe heart condition which often interrupts his duty. After the autopsy is conducted, Zeth investigates the neighborhood that links to Douglas' car registration address, finding out Douglas was a troubled boy growing up. Emory also gathers more info about Daphne from a missing person's report. Detectives Emory and Zeth discovers the cellphone obtained from the car at the crash site only made one transmission to another phone, and it tracks back to three retailers in Alabama. After getting a warrant, they search out Douglas' house where they find drawings in a closet, and they head to his workplace to uncover more info. Soon, the police department develop a profile, presuming Douglas was a sex offender having issues with his own sexuality; they also conclude he was isolated in his adolescent years and sought approval from an accomplice who shares similar interests. Probing Daphne's house, it becomes known she is pregnant. Emory begins doubting his faith over his dying wife and the missing victim. Meanwhile, Zeth finds help to hack into a black market eBay-like site using a flash drive found at Douglas' workplace which contained access codes and photos. There, Douglas had cryptically interacted with his new found accomplice, Simon (Tom Arnold), sharing photos and videos of victims and exchanging money for them. The detectives track Douglas' bank records, and this leads to discovering Douglas had lived in Alabama, neighboring Daphne. They also pinpoint the Alabama connection to Simon, known as James Rawlings. Having the address, the police force enter Simon's house, but he is not there. They find evidence that detail him as a predator, including a bloody torture room in the basement. This makes the force believe they were too late to save the girl. However, Zeth checks Simon's property tax reports which link to Sumter County, Florida, where he had killed a deer, making the force suspect victims may have been taken somewhere there. They search the woods there at night and find dead bodies restrained to trees. Around this time, Simon, who tracked Daphne using a GPS locator, attempts to take her from the woods, but his plans are stood up by an officer who he shoots down, alerting the rest of the force. He drops Daphne and tries to escape. Emory and Zeth find Daphne and continue to pursue Simon, who shoots Zeth in the chest, piercing his armor. Eventually, Emory subdues Simon and he is taken into custody, while Zeth is hospitalized. Emory's wife Sirena soon succumbs to end stages of a heart failure and dies. At the end of the film, Emory visits Daphne, who gave birth, and a surviving Zeth in the hospital. On his way out, Emory stops by the nursery room giving a faint smile of hope before he leaves.

History  Nomads RFC, now known as Southsea Nomads RFC, was formed in May 1978 by a group of players who had all been members of the now defunct Portsmouth Civil Service RFC. That club disbanded at the end of season ‘77-78 and some players not wishing to join other local clubs decided to form one of their own. So with a meeting held at the “Old House at Home” Paulsgrove, Nomads RFC was born. The name was chosen because the team had no home and the logo of a Snail wearing a scrum cap soon followed, as a snail is a Nomad who carries its home on its back. Some of the original members are still around the club (Barry Bridgman, Colin Few ~ President, Ken Walker, Garry Barter, Nicky Cadle, Terry Welsh). Nomads have had several temporary homes over the years. The “John Barleycorn”, Great Southsea St., which was its first home and now has been turned into a private dwelling. The Royal Sailors Home Club, Queen Street from 1981 and Watersedge Park Community Centre which became its clubhouse from 1987. It has also played at three different grounds, starting at Farlington, being moved by the council to Alexandra Park, then to the Eastern Road Sailing Centre Ground (the best) and then back to Farlington. Its home now is the Portsmouth University ground at the end of Locksway Road, with its Clubhouse being the \\"Old House at Home\\" pub not far from it. They were founder members of the then Courage Leagues in 1989, forming part of the Hampshire league set up. They were the first club in Hampshire to form and run a Women’s team, though this team disbanded at the end of the 1999-2000 season. They have run three sides for Men in the past (including a veterans team) but are reduced to two now as there seems to be a general reduction in the numbers of people playing Rugby. Kevin Darnley of Portsmouth started with Nomads, as did Douggie Setchell of Gosport, Robbie Allsopp, Tony Armstrong of Havant and most recently John Brothers of Trojans. The side was (in 2011–2012) in Hampshire Division One, led by skipper Chris Groves.

It is a Condeep-type oil platform, built in Norway by the company Norwegian Contractors for Equinor. It is known for its catastrophic failure on 23 August 1991, due to a design flaw, that resulted from an error caused by unconservative concrete codes and inaccurate finite element analysis modelling of the tricell, which formed part of the ballasting/flotation system.Arnold DN. The sinking of the Sleipner A offshore platform. URL: http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/sleipner.html . Accessed on: June 27, 2008. Location Sleipner A is located on the Sleipner East gas field on the North Sea. Also six satellite fields–Gungne, Loke, Alpha North, Sigyn, Volve and Volve South–are tied-back to Sleipner A. In addition to its own operations, the platform is used as a remote operation center for the Sleipner B wellhead platform. The Sleipner B is operated from the Sleipner A via an umbilical cable. In addition, the Sleipner T carbon dioxide treatment platform is linked physically to the Sleipner A platform by a bridge. Design The platform is designed to accommodate roughly 160 people. The platform deck is with height of . The original hull was a gravity base made up of support pilings and concrete ballast chambers from which three or four shafts rise and upon which the deck sits. Once fully ballasted, the hull was to sit on the sea floor. There were 24 chambers, of which four formed the 'legs' supporting the facility on top in the case of the Sleipner A oil rig. The hull was redesigned after the accident and the Sleipner A Platform was successfully completed in June 1993. 1991 accident Collapse The original hull collapsed during the final construction because of a design flaw. It was towed into Gandsfjord where it was to be lowered in the water in a controlled ballasting operation at a rate of 1 meter per 20 minutes. This was necessary for the fitment of the deck platform to the hull. As the hull was lowered to the mark, rumbling noises were heard followed by the sound of water pouring into the unit. A cell wall had failed and a serious crack had developed, and sea water poured in at a rate that was too great for the deballasting pumps to deal with. Within a few minutes the hull began sinking at a rate of 1 meter per minute. As the structure sank deeper into the fjord, the buoyancy chambers imploded and the rubble struck the floor of the fjord, creating a Richter magnitude scale 3 earthquake. Later analysis showed that the failure would occur at 62 meters (203 feet). No one was injured during the accident. Investigation The post-accident investigation by SINTEF in Norway discovered that the root cause of the failure resulted from inaccurate NASTRAN calculations in the design of the structure. Stresses on the ballast chambers were underestimated by 47% and some concrete walls were designed too thin to resist foreseeable hydrostatic pressure when submerged. As the pressure increased, the walls failed and cracked, allowing sea water to enter the tank at an uncontrolled rate, eventually sinking the hull. After the accident, the project leaders from Norwegian Contractors were brought before the Statoil board, and were expecting severe repercussions. But the director instead asked the famous question \\"Can you make a new one before schedule?\\" to which the contractors replied \\"Yes we can\\". The new hull was completed before schedule. Computer- Aided Catastrophes Computer-Aided Catastrophes, or CAC for short, such as the Sleipner Incident presented in this article, provide extremely valuable lessons for practising engineers working with numerical simulation tools such as the finite element method. The reason for the poor finite element result that led to the Sleipner Incident have been studied in more detail in NAFEMS Benchmark Challenge Number 6.

The head is mostly black and there are black flecks on the anterior part of the body. The cheeks, sides of the tail, and lower flanks are black with dense white flecks. Habitat and conservation In north-western Guatemala, Bradytriton silus is known from both disturbed and undisturbed wet forest at an elevation of about above sea level. Specimens were found under pieces of wood and logs. Development is presumably direct (i.e., no free-living larval stage) and not dependent on water. The area of the type locality is subject to severe habitat loss caused by the settlement of refugees and expanding agriculture; the species has not been recorded there after 1976, despite later searches. However, another population was reported from Chiapas, Mexico in 2015.

Biography  Born Konstantin Evgenievich Panfilov in Moscow, Soviet Union, he took his grandfather's surname for his stage name Kostya Kinchev. When Kinchev was a 15-year-old, he heard heavy metal band Black Sabbath for the first time. After that he decided to collect musical albums of hard rock bands of that time. In the mid 1970s, before joining Alisa he played in some local Moscow-based bands. In 1984 Kinchev made the decision to leave Moscow and move to Leningrad, where he was offered to become Alisa's vocalist. The band's lineup was finally completed in December 1984, when new vocalist Kostya Kinchev and guitarist Petr Samoylov joined. Their debut album Energia was released by state publishing monopoly Melodiya and sold more than a million copies.Кинчев на православном лектории: «Разочарую, я не проповедник – я рок-звезда! In 1987, the newspaper Smena accused Alisa's leader Kinchev of Nazi propaganda and worshipping Hitler. Kinchev filed a suit for calumny and moral loss compensation. After the year- long court process the magazine published a refutation. Alisa's next album was titled Article 206 part 2, a chapter (\\"Hooliganism\\") of the Soviet Union Procedural Code, alluding to this process. Kinchev was baptised in 1992 after a series of concerts in Jerusalem, and since then Christianity has been the main influence on his alignment and his lyrics. Since the late 1990s his lyrics mainly dealt with Christianity, Russian patriotism, and Slavic unity. Kinchev has good relations with the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church. Kinchev's fairly conservative religious-patriotic shift was viewed unfavourably by some old fans that liked Alisa for their original \\"rock\\" message.Константин Кинчев: «Попадая в Церковь, сразу начинаешь получать маленькие уроки любви» Still others are put off by his antisemitism – among other things, he has referred to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a credible source.Архив RS.

She served in the Pacific Ocean in World War II and the Korean War, and was awarded six battle stars for World War II and two battle stars during the Korean War. She was the third U.S. Navy vessel to be named Chickasaw, and was launched 23 July 1942 by United Engineering Co., Ltd., Alameda, California; sponsored by Mrs. R. Fairbanks; commissioned 4 February 1943, Lieutenant (junior grade) J. F. King in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Chickasaw departed Seattle, Washington, 11 March 1943, for Pearl Harbor towing yard floating drydock YFD-21, and arrived on 30 March. Sailing on to Espiritu Santo, Chickasaw served as station tug until 27 June, when she stood out for Pearl Harbor. Arriving 6 July, she had salvage duty, towed targets, laid buoys, and made tows to Midway Island until 21 January 1944, when she sailed for the Marshalls.  Supporting island invasions  Chickasaw supported the occupation of Kwajalein, Majuro, and Eniwetok until 19 March, when she cleared Kwajalein for Pearl Harbor, arriving 27 March. She sailed from Pearl Harbor on 11 May, was reclassified ATF-83 on 15 May, and arrived at Majuro on 24 May for training duty. Clearing the Marshalls on 11 June, Chickasaw arrived off Saipan on 16 June for tug duties, patrol, and salvage in support of the occupation of that island until 24 July. Similar duty found Chickasaw off Tinian from 24 July 1944. After continued salvage duty in the Marianas Chickasaw cleared Saipan on 18 September for Guam, Eniwetok, and Manus, arriving 4 October.  Supporting the invasion of the Philippines  Six days later she sailed for the assault on Leyte, arriving in Leyte Gulf on 20 October. Here she conducted salvage and rescue operations through the landings, the fury of the Battle for Leyte Gulf, and the occupation, until 22 November when she sailed for replenishment and salvage duty at Manus. On 27 December she got underway for Lingayen Gulf, arriving 9 January 1945 for salvage operations during the assault. She remained at Lingayen, Subic Bay, and San Pedro Bay on similar duty until 4 March, when she cleared for overhaul and tug duties at Ulithi. From 9-22 June she next operated off Okinawa, then sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 24 July for yard overhaul.  Post-war activity  Variously based at San Diego, California, Pearl Harbor, and in the Marianas between World War II and the Korean War, Chickasaw served the Fleet with towing, salvage, and other tug duty which took her throughout the Pacific.  Korean War support  During the first year of the Korean War, she operated on the U.S. West Coast, to Pearl Harbor, and to Eniwetok and Kwajalein, and during the summer of 1951, sailed in Alaskan waters. After west coast operations, she cleared Pearl Harbor on 3 March 1953 for Sasebo, her base for direct support to forces engaged in the Korean War. Returning to San Diego, California, 17 October, she resumed an operating schedule which through 1960 included Alaskan operations in 1954-55 and 1957, and deployments to the Far East in 1957-58, 1959, and 1960.  Decommissioning  After being decommissioned (date unknown) she was struck from the Naval Register on 15 April 1976. She was sold to the Republic of China under the Security Assistance Program, 1 May 1976, and renamed Ta Tung (A-548). Her ultimate fate is unknown.

Educated at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1905 and served in the U.S. Navy until 1909. He then went into business and in 1911 married May Bourne, the daughter of Frederick Gilbert Bourne, president of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. An unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the elections of 1914, following America's entry in World War I he rejoined the Navy and served as a transport officer until being discharged in 1919. In 1921, Strassburger entered the newspaper business in his hometown, acquiring the Herald then the following year the other local, the Times. He merged the papers to create the Norristown Times Herald which still operates to this day. Of importance to historians and genealogists is Strassburger's book Pennsylvania German Pioneers: a publication of the original lists of arrival in the Port of Philadelphia from 1727 to 1808 published in 1934 in two volumes. Normandy Farm In 1913, Ralph Strassburger and his wife purchased an early 18th-century farm and manor house in Whitpain Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania where he raised horses and Ayrshire cattle. They spent a considerable amount of money on renovations and the construction of new utility buildings plus land acquisitions that over time expanded the property from 82 to . They called the place Normandy Farm, the name coming from an area of France that the Strassburgers loved and was renowned for its many important horse farms. The Normandy Farm remained in the Strassburger family for several decades after Ralph Strassburger's death in 1959. Today, the property is listed on the United States government's National Register of Historic Places and is used as a hotel and conference center. European Thoroughbred horse racing In an era when many wealthy Americans maintained secondary residences in Paris, France, and/or estates on the French Riviera, some like William Kissam Vanderbilt, Joseph E. Widener and Ralph Strassburger were involved in the very popular sport of Thoroughbred horse racing and acquired breeding farms in the renowned horse region of Lower Normandy. In the 1920s, Ralph and May Strassburger purchased a villa from Baron Henri de Rothschild in Normandy's exclusive resort city of Deauville. Albert Stopford supplied them with antique. They also acquired the Haras des Monceaux Thoroughbred horse farm at Lisieux, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) south of Deauville. Their French racing stable enjoyed considerable success at the Deauville-La Touques Racecourse as well as at other racecourses in France and in England. Widely respected, France Galop refers to Ralph Strassburger as a \\"great friend of France.\\" To avoid seizure by the Nazis during the German occupation of France during World War II, all of the Strassburger horses raced under the name of a French friend, Mme. de Bonard. Among the Strassburgers' major successes were victories in both the French and British Classic Races as well as in the prestigious Washington, D.C. International Stakes in the United States.

When preserved in alcohol they found the specimens had an overall dark brown coloration with a light tan underbelly. Features of interest were their webbed \\"spatulate\\" feet, number of costal grooves (12-13) and tails which were slightly longer in length than the head and body combined. Their proportionally longer limbs, shorter heads, and large quantity of vomerine teeth set them apart from other species of Chiropterotriton. Their natural habitat is believed to be damp caves where they were initially discovered, however the exact locations are unknown. They are threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation and the expansion of agriculture in the region which causes the caves to become dry.

Early life  William Bennett Bond was born on September 10, 1815 at Truro, England, to John Bond and Nanny Bennett. William was educated at Calday Grange Grammar School and later somewhere in London. At age 17, Bond left England to work in business at St. John's, Newfoundland. There, he met Mark Willoughby, a superintendent of the Newfoundland School Society, and joined his bible class. Under the direction of the Reverend Thomas Finch Hobday Bridge, Bond began to read for ordination. In 1839, Bond moved to Lower Canada, and the next year was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Quebec, George Jehoshaphat Mountain. His first post as deacon was as a mission to the Quebec countryside, purportedly founding eleven schools in the township of Hemmingford. In 1841, Bond was ordained priest in Montreal. In 1842, Bond was appointed incumbent of a church in Lachine, and held at least four services a week, three on a Sunday.  Montreal  In 1848, Bond travelled to Montreal, where he served as assistant minister at St George's church. The same year, he replaced Willoughby as a superintendent of the Newfoundland School Society. Bond quickly rose in prominence within the Anglican church, becoming rector of his church in 1863 and rural dean of Hochelaga the same year. In 1866, he became canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Montreal, and four years later the domestic chaplain to Ashton Oxenden, the Bishop of Montreal and Archdeacon of Hochelaga. In 1872 he was appointed Dean of Montreal, a position he held until his consecration as bishop. Bond's most significant contribution to the Anglican church in Montreal was his work with youth. His church of St. George played host to the largest Sunday school in the city, and Bond's founding of the St. George's YMCA led to the creation of at least six new Montreal parishes. In 1878, the diocese of Montreal elected Bond as their third bishop, consecrated on January 25 the following year. He immediately set about reorganizing the financial affairs of the diocese, which had been weakened by an economic downturn during the 1870s.  Later years  By 1900, Bond's health was clearly declining, and in 1902, his coadjutor James Carmichael had to take over many of his duties. In spite of this, Bond was elected Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada in 1904. His death on October 9, 1906 cut short his primacy, causing him to be one of the shortest-serving primates of Canada.

Early life  Sweatman was born on 19 November 1834 in London, England to parents John and Anne. His education began in two London private schools, followed by education at University College School. In 1859, Sweatman received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Christ's College, Cambridge and was ordained as a deacon the same year. Sweatman soon distinguished himself as a pioneer in the movement for boys' clubs, beginning with the founding of the Islington Youths' Institute in 1860. In 1865, whilst curate of St Stephen's in Canonbury, he impressed the visiting headmaster of Huron College, Upper Canada with his work with youths. The visiting headmaster convinced Sweatman to become the first headmaster of the London Collegiate Institute in Huron, serving there until 1871. Until 1872, he was the mathematics master at Upper Canada College, leaving there to become the rector of Grace Church in Brantford until 1874. From 1874 to 1876, Sweatman again served as the principal of the London Collegiate Institute, which had been renamed Hellmuth Boys’ College. From 1876 to 1879, he was the priest in charge of New St Paul's, Woodstock.  Bishop of Toronto  On 3 February 1879, the second bishop of the Diocese of Toronto, Alexander Bethune, died. Later that month, the synod met to elect a new bishop. Most of the clergy were inclined to vote for George Whitaker, the provost of the University of Trinity College. However, the lay synod delegates were opposed to the clergy candidate and proposed a Reverend Dr Sullivan as their candidate, who was then on his way from Chicago to Montreal to take up the rectory there. Neither candidate received the necessary number of votes to become the bishop. Sweatman was elected as a compromise between the clergymen and laymen of the synod after five days of balloting. On 1 May 1879, the Bishop of Quebec consecrated Sweatman in St. James' Cathedral, Toronto. On 10 June of the same year, Sweatman made his views clear to the first synod under his presidency. His views were not radical, but of moderation. He immediately set to work, transforming a debt-ridden diocese into a financially stable one, as well as allowing social works consistent with the Oxford Movement. In 1884, Sweatman recognized the foundation of the Sisterhood of St. John the Divine, an Anglican religious order of women dedicated to nursing, education and other charitable endeavors, led by Hannah Grier Coome. Although they were initially criticized as \\"papist,\\" their service during the Northwest Rebellion earned praise and acceptance. Rt. Rev. Sweatman also worked towards a grand new cathedral for Toronto. In 1885, the trustees of the land reserved for the future cathedral donated $2,000 towards his cause, possibly to enhance the property value of the site. Before the end of the year, a building had been erected on the site to house the bishop and his family. Although St. Alban's Cathedral was eventually completed to some extent, its construction incurred heavy debts for the diocese. This project was viewed by Sweatman as one of his most disappointing ventures.  Later life  In 1905, Sweatman suffered a seizure, and in 1907 became the Archbishop of Toronto. The same year, he was elected Metropolitan of Canada and the Primate of All Canada, the third since the position's creation. Two years later, on 24 January 1909, Sweatman died of bronchial pneumonia.

Almost all specimens have a lighter interorbital bar. Habitat and conservation Dendrotriton cuchumatanus is known from very humid oak forest at about above sea level. Specimens have been found under moss and bark on large fallen trees and in moss (but not in bromeliads as for many of its relatives). The species is threatened by habitat loss caused by forest clearance. As of 2008, the type locality was inside a proposed semi- protected area.

It is endemic to the United States. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and rivers. This species is threatened by habitat loss. Distribution and habitat This species was first described by Anderson and Tilley in 2003 and little information is known about it. Prior to that time the Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus) had been thought to be a single species but studies using nucleic acid sequencing and agar gel electrophoresis have since shown it to be a species complex. The Cumberland dusky salamander is one of five members of this complex and has been found at several sites in Tennessee on the Cumberland Plateau. The most northerly of these is near Wartburg in Morgan County and the most southerly is on the southern side of the Cumberland Plateau near Tracy City in Grundy County. All known specimens have been found under rocks in streams or within a metre (yard) of flowing water and a favoured location is moss-covered rocks behind cascades. Ecology Several other species of salamander occupy the same range as the Cumberland dusky salamander and it is believed to hybridize with the Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus) and the Ocoee Salamander (Desmognathus ocoee). It is likely that the Cumberland dusky salamander feeds on small invertebrates found in leaf litter. It may itself be eaten by small mammals, birds and snakes and perhaps by other larger salamanders in the genus Desmognathus. Status The Cumberland dusky salamander is listed as \\"Near Threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The exact size of the population is unknown but the species is restricted to a single tract of land in Tennessee and its natural habitat is threatened by the building of retirement and vacation homes. Its status is made more secure by the fact that it occurs in two protected areas, the Frozen Head State Park and the Obed River area which is designated as a \\"National Wild and Scenic River\\".

It is endemic to the United States. They are found in small areas of Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. It gets its name from the seepages around which it lives. It is very similar in its appearance and life history to the pygmy salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species differ greatly from the other Desmognathus species. They are the smallest salamanders in the genus, measuring only in length. They are also the only two terrestrial, direct- developing Desmognathus species. However, the two species are not often seen to coexist, differing in distribution by elevation; although there are exceptions. The seepage salamander is currently listed as Near Threatened, with its numbers declining in most of states in which it is found. It is threatened by habitat loss, with logging having a major effect. Description The seepage salamander is a very small and slender salamander, ranging from . The adults possess vomerine teeth.Brown, W. C., and S. C. Bishop. 1947. A new species of Desmognathus from North Carolina. Copeia 1947: 163-166. The tail is terete and rounded. The seepage salamander has a pale dorsal stripe, with a wide, wavy to almost straight shape, and ranging in color from yellow or tan to reddish brown.Conant, R. and Collins, J. 1998. Peterson Field Guides: Reptiles and Amphibians (Eastern/Central North America). Houghton Mifflin Company, New York. The stripe is sometimes flecked with a darker pigment. A mid-dorsal, dark line is also seen and is continuous with a Y-shaped mark on the head. There is a dark brown band on the sides, fading towards the belly. The underbelly is pale and is mottled with brown and white, but it may also be plain, with no other coloration. The seepage salamander is easily confused with the Pygmy Salamander (Desmognathus wrighti). These two species overlap in a small area of southern North Carolina. D. wrighti and D. aeneus are the smallest species in the genus Desmognathus and are the only terrestrial direct-developers, lacking a free- swimming larval stage.Hining, K.J., Bruce, R.C. 2005. Population Structure and Life History Attributes of Syntopic Populations of the Salamanders Desmognathus aeneus and Desmognathus wrighti (Amphibia: Plethodontidae) Southeastern Naturalist 4: 679-688. They both have vomerine teeth, and similar tail length to total body length ratios; however, they have different patterns and coloration. Seepage salamanders have a smoother top of the head. The mental glands are also shaped differently in the males. The pygmy salamander has a large, U-shaped mental gland while the seepage salamander's is small and kidney shaped. General description and taxonomy The seepage salamander is part of the genus Desmognathus and the family Plethodontidae. Like all other plethodontids, the seepage salamander is lungless and respires through its skin and the lining of its mouth. They also have a naso-labial groove and a relatively immoveable lower jaw which allows them to force their way under objects. As with all species in Desmognathus, they have a pale line running diagonally from the eye to the angle of the jaw. This line may be hard to see in older, darker adults. Their hind legs are larger and stouter than the forelegs. Their body is short and stout and they are good jumpers, often used as an escape. According to the phylogenetic tree, the seepage salamander branched deep within the tree of the Desmognathus species. D. aeneus is a sister group to all species of Desmognathus except D. wrighti, which is an outgroup.Kozak, K.H., Bonett, A.L., Harmon, L.J., 2005. Phylogenetic Analysis of Ecomorphological Divergence, Community Structure, and Diversification Rates in Dusky Salamanders (Plethodontidae: Desmognathus). Evolution 59:2000-2016. D. aeneus and D. wrighti have distinct character differences from the rest of the Desmognathus species. They are the smallest species, direct-developers, and the most terrestrial, with all other species being semi-aquatic or aquatic. Since these two species branch the earliest, evolution has moved toward larger body size, lengthened larval periods, and more aquatic habitats within Desmognathus.Titus, T. A. and Larson, A. 1996. Molecular phylogenetics of desmognathine salamanders (Caudata: Plethodontidae): a reevaluation of evolution in ecology, life history, and morphology. Systematic Biology, 45(4), 451-472. Geographic distribution Seepage salamanders get their name from the seepages where they are often found. However, they are also found near streams and under leaf litter, leaf mold, and rotten logs. They are a terrestrial species. Seepage salamanders are distributed in southeast Tennessee, southwest North Carolina, northern Georgia, and central to northern Alabama. They are found in Monroe and Polk counties in Tennessee; Fannin, Pickens, Towns, and Union counties in Georgia; Oconee County in South Carolina; and Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Macon, and Swain counties in North Carolina. In Alabama, they can be found in Calhoun, Clay, Cleburne, and Tallapoosa counties.NatureServe. 2010. NatureServe Explorer: An online encyclopedia of life [web application]. Version 7.1. NatureServe, Arlington, Virginia. Available http://www.natureserve.org/explorer. (Accessed: April 25, 2011 ) They also might be found in Cherokee, Chilton, Etowah, Hale, and Tuscaloosa counties in Alabama, but may be extirpated from these locales. Populations have a disjunct distribution and are highly localized. There is an isolated colony in western Alabama, and one in northeastern Georgia. Populations are found at elevations ranging from . However, in the colony in northeastern Georgia they can be found as low as . Ecology The seepage salamander does not experience much competition from other species of salamanders due to its habitat. Because it is a terrestrial salamander, it is not disturbed by the semi-aquatic and aquatic salamanders.Hairston, N.G. Sr. 1986. Species packing in Desmognathus salamanders: experimental demonstration of predation and competition. Am. Nat. 127:266-291 Almost all other Desmognathus species are found at closer distances to streams. The lack of competition also may be due to the fact that it is very secretive. It is seldom seen on the surface, which may be an anti-predatory response. The only species of Desmognathus which would be found in the same habitat as the seepage salamander and create competitive pressure is the pygmy salamander (D. wrighti). However, the ranges of the two species rarely overlap. The pygmy salamander is found at higher elevations, while the seepage salamander is found at lower ones. The pygmy salamander is found on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee. The distribution range of the seepage salamander begins just below the pygmy salamander's range. However, there have been cases where the two species are found together. It has been observed that they coexist in Monroe County, Tennessee and it is possible that they coexist in Blount County, Tennessee.Reynolds, R.G., Niemiller, M.L., and Pasachnik. 2011. Occurrence of pygmy salamanders (Desmognathus wrighti) in Monroe County, Tennessee. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science 86(2):53–55 Further studies are needed to determine their interactions and would aid in conservation efforts. Life history and behavior Seepage salamanders are rarely seen on the surface even at night, despite being nocturnal. The food sources consists mainly of arthropods, especially insect larvae and springtails.Donovan, L.A. and G.W. Folkerts. 1972. Foods of the seepage salamander, Desmognathus aeneus Brown and Bishop. Herpetologica 28:35–37. Mites, spiders, earthworms, crustaceans, nematodes, myriapods, and snails have also been found to be eaten by seepage salamanders. Life history The seepage salamander is terrestrial and develop directly into juveniles, skipping the aquatic, larval stage. The length of time between fertilization and hatching is 68–75 days.Marks, S.B., Collazo, A. 1998. Direct Development in Desmognathus aeneus (Caudata: Plethodontidae): A Staging Table. Copeia 3: 637-648. When eggs hatch, the juveniles clearly resemble the adults. They possess eyes, naso-labial grooves, gills, coloration similar to adults, and lack gills. Their gills are shorter and branch less than other Desmognathus species, and are reabsorbed very quickly. In other non-direct developing Desmognathus species, naso-labial grooves, coloration, and eyes are not present when eggs are first hatched, but show up after and extended larval period. This larval stage also possesses tails and gills that are not quickly resorbed in comparison. Oviposition occurs in April and May, with all eggs ready for deposition by the female being laid. The eggs hatch in the late spring and summer. There have been some discrepancies about how long it takes for the eggs to hatch. Both males and females reach sexual maturation after two years. Harrison (1967) found that eggs hatched in 43–45 days, but Marks and Collazo found 68–75 days. This may be due to different incubation temperatures, but the difference has not been fully explored. Courtship There is little diversity within Plethodontidae in regards to mating. The mating process consists of courting behavior, the tail straddling walk, sperm deposition in the form of a spermatophore, and insemination. However, the seepage salamander differs in its courtship behavior. As with all other plethodontids, pheromones are secreted by males and are used during the courtship process. Most species use a pulling or snapping behavior. However, only D. aeneus and D. wrighti use biting as a delivery mechanism. These two species physically and directly restrain the females and bite them. The bites can last up to several hours. Then they release pheromones into the bite wounds.Promislow, D. E. L. 1987. Courtship behavior of a plethodontid salamander, Desmognathus aeneus. J. Herpetol. 21:298-306. Other plethodontids do not directly restrain the females when excreting pheromones. Conservation The seepage salamander is classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN because their range is not greater than 20,000 km2 and its habitat and population size is decreasing. The isolation of the different population also increases susceptibility to declines. Seepage salamanders are on the verge of becoming classified as Vulnerable. The species is in decline in Alabama and North Carolina, but is stable in South Carolina. It is listed as in need of management in Tennessee. Logging is a main source of decline within the species, particularly in Alabama.Folkerts, G.W. 1968. The genus Desmognathus Baird (Amphibia: Plethodontidae) in Alabama. Ph.D. dissertation. Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama. Around half of the populations known in 1976 are now extinct.Harrison, J. 2011. Desmognathus aeneus: Seepage Salamander. AmphibiaWeb. Berkeley, California. http://amphibiaweb.org/> Other forestry practices, like clear cutting also threaten seepage salamanders. Most populations of seepage salamanders do not occur within protected areas. Therefore, to decrease vulnerability of populations to certain forestry practices, buffers should be set up in susceptible areas around seepages and streams.

The specific epithet is in honour of Herbert Hutchinson Brimley and his younger brother, Clement Samuel Brimley, both of whom were zoologists. Description The Ouachita dusky salamander grows to about in length including a finned tail. The upper side is greenish- brown or grey of a fairly uniform colour and the juveniles have a row of pale spots along each side. There are fourteen costal rib grooves on either side. Distribution and habitat The Ouachita dusky salamander occurs in mountainous areas of Arkansas and Oklahoma. Its range includes the Ouachita Mountains, Petit Jean Mountain, Rich Mountain, the Winding Stair Mountain National Recreation Area, the Black Fork Mountain Wilderness, the Kiamichi Mountains and the Potato Hills north of Tuskahoma. They live in and near mountain streams and the ravines and woodland close by, on scree slopes, in gravelly areas, on islands and near springs. Biology Breeding takes place mainly between July and September. The female deposits twenty to thirty eggs in a grape-like cluster under rocks or in mud chambers usually on land. She broods them until they hatch and then the larvae make their way to water. At first they conceal themselves in the gaps between stones and debris on the streambed. They are carnivorous and overwinter as larvae, undergoing metamorphosis the following summer. Status In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Desmognathus brimleyorum is listed as being of \\"Least concern\\". There may be a slow decline in numbers but these have not been quantified and there are thought to be more than 10,000 individuals across its range. The greatest threat is the silting up of the streams where it breeds due to logging activities, but when the streams recover, the salamanders move back into the area.

It originally aired on TV from April 1995 to April 2002. Based closely on the Raid Gauloises adventure race, the broadcast of Eco-Challenge led to the popularity of the adventure racing. The race returned in September 2019, taking place in Fiji. The new series, under the title World's Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, premiered on August 14, 2020 on Amazon Prime Video. Overview Eco-Challenge is generally regarded as the genesis for modern-day reality television, and adventure documentary series launching the success of Mark Burnett and his subsequent television shows Survivor, The Apprentice, The Contender, Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, The Voice, and many more. Eco- Challenge was created in 1992 by Mark Burnett. Inspired by a Los Angeles Times article about Gerald Fusil's Raid Gauloises adventure race in Costa Rica, Burnett formed a team and competed in two Raid Gauloises events. Although his teams did poorly, Burnett decided to create a similar race in North America. When the race went international, Burnett purchased the rights from Fusil and set out to make the Eco-Challenge the world's premier adventure race. The teams raced non-stop, 24 hours a day, over a rugged 300-mile (500 km) course, participating in such disciplines as trekking, whitewater canoeing, horseback riding, sea kayaking, scuba diving, mountaineering, camel-back riding, and mountain biking. Teams originally consisted of five members, but the team size was reduced to four members early in the event's history. A feature of the race is the mandatory mix of men and women for all participating teams. The first Eco-Challenge was held on April 25, 1995, in the Utah desert and was held each year in a new locale until 2002. Burnett recently noted that he did not intend to hold another Eco-Challenge, but had considered selling the rights to it. In contrast, other expedition-length races, including Primal Quest and the Patagonian Expedition Race continue to be held. Multiple winners (through 2002) include Ian Adamson (AUS / USA: 3x 1st, 2x 2nd, 1x 3rd & 4th), Mike Kloser (USA: 3x 1st, 1x 2nd), John Howard (NZL: 3x 1st, 1x 3rd), Keith Murray (NZL: 3x 1st, 1x 3rd), Neil Jones (NZL: 2x 1st, 1x 2nd), Nathan Faave (NZL: 2x 1st, 1x 2nd), Robert Nagle (IRL / USA: 2x 1st, 1x 3rd), Sarah Ballantyne (USA: 2x 1st), Andrea Murray (NZL / USA: 2x 1st). Television history Each Eco-Challenge was broadcast on cable television. The 1995 Utah race was shown as a 45-minute feature, produced by and broadcast on MTV.Eco- Challenge TV.com The 1995 Maine/New England event was broadcast in segments as part of the Extreme Games broadcast on ESPN. Starting in 1996, Eco-Challenge was aired on the Discovery Channel and the production enjoyed a significantly expanded budget. The 1996 British Columbia production, broadcast on the Discovery Channel won an Emmy Award. 262x262px In 2000, the USA Network agreed to a three-year contract to broadcast the Eco-Challenge. Later that year, the show was nominated for a Prime-Time Emmy Award. USA did not renew the show after the 2002 Fiji race. Although long out of print, the 1996 through 2001 Eco-Challenge races were released on VHS by Discovery soon after the shows aired.Example the British Columbia race was published in 1997 on 3 tapes composed of five episodes: Tape 1: \\"The Gathering\\", \\"Fire and Ice\\"; Tape 2: \\"Breaking Point\\", \\"The Storm\\" and tape 3: \\"The Prize\\". ISBN's for each tape are respectively: , and The Utah, Maine/New England, and Fiji episodes were never officially released in the United States. In 2011, Burnett sold Expedition Impossible, a reality show with a similar concept to Eco-Challenge, to ABC as a summer series. The new show debuted on June 30 of that year. In 2019, the show was revived under the title of World's Toughest Race: Eco- Challenge Fiji, and it premiered on August 14, 2020 on Amazon Prime Video. Events * 1995 Utah Team Hewlett-Packard from France was the winning team. * 1995 Maine/New England (as part of the X-Games X-Venture adventure race). Team Aussie from Australia was the winning team. Twin Team (USA) was second, Eco-Internet 3rd. * 1996 British Columbia: Locations along the race included the Lillooet River, Carpenter Lake, Pemberton Icefield, and the Elaho River. Teams Eco-Internet (captain Ian Adamson with John Howard), Hi Tec, and Hewlett-Packard were in close contention for winning, but Eco-Internet passed a dark zone at an icefall that the other two teams missed; the other two teams decided to finish in second together. The program also followed Team Houston, a first-time team of lawyers; Team Sun Precautions, among whose members was Helen Klein, a 73-year-old ultramarathon racer; and Team S.C.A.R.(Santa Cruz Adventure Racers). * 1997 Australia: Locations along the race included Undara Volcanic National Park, the Herbert River, Blencoe Falls, the Tully River, and Mount Bartle Frere. Team Eco-Internet (captain John Howard) won again, with Team Pure Energy Australia coming in second only 1 hour and 40 minutes behind (captain Ian Adamson) and Canterbury New Zealand 3rd. Teams also followed by the program included the returning Team S.C.A.R., Northern Irish Team Dalriada, and the Japanese Team East Wind, which was notable for physically carrying one of their team members over Mount Bartle Frere after an ankle injury. * 1998 Morocco: The race began along the coast of Essaouira, through the high Atlas Mountains, and ended in Marrakesh. Team Vail (USA, Captain Mike Kloser) won. This is the first time an American team wins Eco Challenge. Team Aussie (Australia) came in 2nd and Team Cepos (Spain), who dominated the race until one of their members suffered altitude sickness, came in 3rd. Featured teams include Team Rubicon, a team composed of 3 female competitors, Team Navigator, a team trying to redeem themselves after requiring emergency evacuation close to the finish line the previous year, Team Mexico, a team of rude men who eventually learned to appreciate their talented female teammate, Team 2020, a cheerful Malaysian team who defied expectations, and Team Urban Edge, a rookie team of New Yorkers. * 1999 Argentina was based from San Carlos de Bariloche in the Andes Mountains, starting in Patagonia Lakes region on Largo Nahuei Huapi.

The species is commonly called the dusky salamander or northern dusky salamander to distinguish it from populations in the southern United States which form a separate species, the southern dusky salamander (D. auriculatus). The northern dusky salamander is the most widespread representative of its genus in Canada. It can be found in eastern North America from extreme eastern Canada in New Brunswick south into the panhandle of Florida and west to Louisiana. The size of the species' total population is unknown, but is assumed to easily exceed 100,000. The species' habitat differs somewhat geographically; dusky salamanders in the northern part of the range prefer rocky woodland streams, seepages, and springs, while those in the south favor floodplains, sloughs, and muddy places along upland streams. They are most common where water is running or trickling. They hide under various objects, such as leaves or rocks, either in or near water. Alternatively, they may enter burrows for protection. The dusky salamander lays its eggs close to water under moss or rocks, in logs, or in stream-bank cavities. The larval stage which follows is normally aquatic.  Description  A small but sturdy salamander, the upper body of the northern dusky salamander varies in colour from reddish-brown to gray or olive, with a white or grey underside. The body is sparsely covered with dark spots or mottling concentrated on the sides. It also has a light dorsal stripe or two dark stripes that continue on to the first part of the tail. Juvenile colouring consists of five to eight pairs of dorsal spots or blotches located between the front and hind legs. Older individuals tend to be uniformly dark brown or black. As with all dusky salamander species, both juveniles and adults have a pale single stripe outlined in black that extends from the eye and runs diagonally to the rear of the jaw. Additionally, both have 14 costal grooves, larger hind limbs than forelimbs, and a keeled (knife-like) tail that is triangular in cross-section and compressed laterally at the base. The tail is less than half its body length and is normally lighter in colour in comparison to the body. Adults attain lengths of up to 14 cm, with the average length of adult males and females being 9.4 cm and 8.6 cm, respectively. Being from the family Plethodontidae, the northern dusky salamander is lungless. It absorbs oxygen through the skin and membranous tissue located in the mouth and throat. The dusky salamander also has a naso-labial groove, which aids olfaction, and thus the ability to search out mates and prey through smell. A northern dusky salamander in mud.  Similar species  The dusky salamander is similar in appearance to and thus often confused with the Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus). Distinguishing characteristics are that the dorsal spots of the Mountain dusky salamander are usually chevron-shaped and its tail rounded at the base rather than laterally compressed. Additionally, hybridization has been known to occur between the Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander and the northern dusky salamander. The northern dusky salamander can also be differentiated from other lungless salamanders including the eastern red-backed, the northern two-lined and the four-toed. They have a distinguishing pale-coloured line that runs from behind their eyes to the rear of the jaw, and heavier set bodies with longer hind legs than front legs.  Range  This species is native to North America, and occurs throughout central-eastern regions of Canada and the United States, from southern New Brunswick , southeastern Quebec and southern Ontario southwest to eastern Ohio, and southern Illinois, Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Disjunctive populations also occur in north/northeastern Arkansas and Louisiana, the Carolinas, northern and central Georgia, as well as the Florida panhandle. The Canadian distribution accounts for approximately 5% of the global range. Within its Canadian range, the northern dusky salamander usually occurs in forested habitat located in high elevation, low-order streams. There are two separate units (DU), the Quebec/New Brunswick DU and the Carolinian DU in Ontario.  Habitat  In the northern extent of their range, the northern dusky salamander inhabits saturated soil near springs, seepages, and small tributaries of small headwater streams otherwise known as the riparian zone. Habitat quality is optimal in undisturbed watersheds and where water is running or trickling and there is an abundance of forest cover The forest cover serves to keep the water cool and well oxygenated, and maintains moisture and temperature at levels necessary for salamander survival. In the south, the northern dusky salamander can be found in upland streams as well as floodplains, sloughs and muddy sites.  Behavior and ecology  The species uses subterranean retreats or burrows near the streams edge as well as leaf litter, logs, rocks and moss as a source of protective cover for avoiding desiccation and predators. These microhabitats are also important for foraging and nesting both of which take place on land close to the water's edge. As a result of desiccation and predators, activity of the northern dusky salamander peaks in the morning, and the evening and early night. Alongside the stream, females nest in cryptic microhabitats where soil is saturated with water. Their eggs are often laid in logs, under rocks or moss, or stream-bank cavities. During development while in the larval stage, the northern dusky salamander is strictly aquatic, its habitat the interstitial spaces between rocks of the streambed. In winter, they remain in shallow running water, whereas adults overwinter in subterranean retreats or in streams, often remaining active throughout winter if the substrate doesn't freeze. As a relatively small amphibian, the northern dusky salamander spends most of its life in hiding. If predated it is capable of autotomy along any point of its tail, but lacks chemical defense mechanisms against its main predators which include larger salamanders, birds, fish, snakes, crayfish, and small mammals. known as maybe rodents or mice The home range of the northern dusky salamander is limited to 1m2 to 3.6 m2. The northern dusky salamander has seasonal variations with its patterns of movement. During warmer months the salamanders have larger home ranges that average around 1.5 m2. This is reduced during the winter and some populations move into specific areas for condensed winter retreats.  Reproduction and development  dusky salamander with eggs in Page County, Virginia Due to their lack of mobility, some populations of dusky salamander are genetically distinct. Breeding is terrestrial and occurs annually in spring or fall and includes elaborate courtship rituals. Adult males have papillose cloacal lips and a small mental gland. These glandular tissues become enlarged when sexually active. Female individuals lack a mental gland and have folded cloacal lips. For reproduction, the male applies the snout, cheeks and mental gland to the snout of the female, who usually responds by picking up the spermatophore. Fecundity increases with body size. Females normally deposit between 10 and 30 eggs under logs, moss or rocks located streamside where soil is saturated with water. Clutch size has been known to vary geographically and can be as large as forty-five, or as few as eight. Females remain with their eggs for an incubation period of six to ten weeks (45 to 60 days) in order to protect them from desiccation and predation . The larvae are predominantly aquatic and approximately 1.5 cm in length upon hatching. The larvae then metamorphose into semi-terrestrial adults, with juvenile salamanders being 2.8 to 4.4 cm in length. Their biphasic life cycle includes an aquatic state of seven to 16 months, followed by a semi- terrestrial adult stage. The northern dusky salamander attains sexual maturity at approximately three to four years of age. Life expectancy is 10 to 15 years.  Feeding  The northern dusky salamander is considered to be feeding generalist, with its diet based on food availability. Stream salamanders are known to be significant predators. This is namely because they are dominant vertebrates within headwater riparian forest ecosystems, with a biomass greater than that reported for fish, birds or small mammals. The species is carnivorous and consumes a variety of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates. Larvae feed predominantly on aquatic invertebrates, whereas the adult diet consists of 60 to 85% of terrestrial invertebrates, including arthropods and earthworms. When prey is in excess, the northern dusky salamander does typically have a preference for the larger and fleshier terrestrial invertebrates, such as earthworms. The aquatic portion of the adult's diet is habitat specific and commensurate with the seasonal abundance and diversity of invertebrates.  Conservation   Population and trends  Current data does not allow an accurate estimate of population size or trends. That said, the total adult population size of the northern dusky salamander is known to exceed 100,000 individuals. There are numerous stable populations throughout the range. The species is widespread in Quebec and New Brunswick but local densities are usually low. In Ontario, the species is rare with a population size estimated at fewer than 250 individuals.  Threats and limiting factors  The northern dusky salamander is extremely vulnerable to desiccation and therefore reliant on clean headwater streams. Resultantly, contamination of ground water or waterways through pollution from urban areas, industry, or agriculture, can be catastrophic to local populations. The disappearance of the species from the Acadian National Park in Maine is believed to be the result of heavy metal contamination. Freshwater stream acidification also poses a significant threat with 40% of streams in the southern Appalachians showing signs of acidification. Changes to stream flow or the groundwater supply, can have significant impacts on local salamander genetics and populations vis-à-vis loss of suitable aquatic or terrestrial habitat, bank instability from excessive runoff, or simply changes to the moisture in the terrestrial habitat. Such changes can be naturally occurring or artificially induced (e.g. discharged water volumes). The activities of forestry can be similarly devastating. Timber harvesting, wind farms and watershed urbanization reduce water supply, water quality and microhabitat availability. Aquatic habitat can be degraded through siltation of streams, or the microhabitat conditions of the forest floor undergoing alterations. Siltation is of particular consequence to the northern dusky salamander because the interstitial spaces that they use for foraging, nesting and overwintering are lost. Urbanization has resulted in the disappearance of the species in Mount Saint-Hellaire National Park in Quebec, as well as other areas. Vulnerability to extirpation is further heightened when the species relies on a single watershed. Such is the case of the Ontario population of the northern dusky salamander. The species is also threatened through the introduction of predatory fish, such as Brook Trout.  Conservation status  The northern dusky salamander is listed as endangered in Ontario and is declining in many parts of the United States yet some populations remain stable. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists its global status as Least Concern. In the province of Ontario, where the status of the Carolinian population of the northern dusky salamander is listed as Endangered, the northern dusky salamander is protected under the Ontario Endangered Species Act of 2007 and by the Ontario Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. These acts protect its habitat and make it illegal to possess, harm or kill the species. In Ontario, a dusky salamander recovery team entitled the \\"Allegheny Mountain Dusky Salamander and Northern Dusky Salamander Recovery Strategy\\" has also been established to develop a recovery plan for both species. The Quebec / New Brunswick population of the northern dusky salamander is considered not at risk. Nonetheless, it is currently on a list of species likely to be designated as threatened or vulnerable by the Quebec provincial government and is also protected by a provincial act that prohibits the collecting or selling of specimens. Likewise, Article 22 of the provincial Environmental Quality Act offers protection against unregulated degradation of the dusky salamander's environment. In New Brunswick, the species is designated as Sensitive under the General Status of Species in Canada. Protection is offered the species by the New Brunswick Fish and Wildlife Act.

In 2004 she became the first woman to scale the East face of the Central Torres del Paine in Chilean Patagonia. In February 2005 she climbed the \\"Compressor\\" route on Cerro Torre. On 21 August 2005 Schwankhart, in the company of Peter Lazarus, James Pitman and Andreas Kiefer reached the top of Trango Tower in Pakistan, becoming the third woman to step on the summit. Biography Schwankhart was born in Johannesburg. She started her schooling in Plettenberg Bay and matriculated in 1994 in Johannesburg. From there she enrolled in a course of fashion design at the Witwatersrand Technikon, but soon changed to Fine Art. She started climbing in 1996 with the Witwatersrand Technikon Mountain Club, where Alard Hufner and Matthew Murison became her mentors and climbing companions. When they finished their studies in 1998 they set off for Europe. Schwankhart and Hufner worked in the UK for 6 months and then left for the States with Mike Mason and Dermot Brogan. Here they climbed in 9 different states over a period of 5 months including Yosemite, where they started on the \\"Leaning Tower\\" and then went on to climb \\"The Nose\\" and \\"The Zodiac\\" on El Capitan in August 1999 - their first experience of big walls. Schwankhart returned briefly to South Africa at the end of 1999 before returning to the UK to resume work. While there she explored climbing areas in England, France and Spain. Her interest in photography grew to the extent that she decided to study photography in South Africa, joined the National college of Photography in 2001 and finished her diploma by the end of that year. In 2002 she worked briefly at the Sowetan newspaper before joining the Sunday Times. At the end of 2003, she, Alard Hufner, Mark Seuring, Mike Mason, Dermot Brogan and Voytek Modrevski set out to do a second ascent of the Torres del Paine route, which the South African team led by Paul Fatti had climbed 30 years earlier and had never been repeated. She became the first woman to ever climb the east face of the central tower. In early 2005 she returned to Patagonia and climbed the \\"Compressor Route\\" on Cerro Torre with Douard le Roux. In August of the same year she climbed the Nameless Tower in Pakistan with Peter Lazarus, James Pitman and Andreas Kiefer. June 2006 saw her embarking on her first adventure documentary film with James Pitman and microlight pilot Mike Blyth. They set out to climb the 3 biggest faces in Southern Africa, with all approaches via microlight. It took 2 weeks to cover more than 5 000 km and 3 big walls being Blouberg, Spitzkoppe, and \\"Oceans of Fear\\", a route on the Klein Winterhoek Mountains of the Western Cape. Their movie was shown at the Banff Mountain Film Festival in 2007. In April 2007 she moved from the Sunday Times to The Times, a daily newspaper, and continued to document news events. In early 2008 she returned to the Torres del Paine in Chile and climbed all three of the towers via the Monzino route, Bonington route, and the North ridge of the South Tower. Two years later, in 2010, she attempted Fitzroy with Andreas Kiefer, but had bad luck with the weather. Instead they climbed various routes on the other peaks in the Fitzroy range - De la S, Guillemette, Rafael. Later that year, she joined Pierre Carter, as project photographer, in his bid to paraglide off the summit of the highest mountain on each continent. Schwankhart and Carter flew in tandem in order for her to capture the full experience on film. In July 2010 they flew off Mount Elbrus in Russia, the highest mountain in Europe. In December of the same year they summitted Aconcagua in Argentina, the highest mountain in South America, but could not fly from the summit due to gale-force winds. In September 2011, they successfully flew off the summit of Kilimanjaro. At that same time, she joined the 'Sunday Times Travel Weekly' as a full-time adventure photographer with journalist Claire Keeton. Together they traveled the subcontinent in search of adventure activities as holiday destinations. After a few years of extensive travel they published a travel guide of their experiences and destinations in a book published by Pan Macmillan called \\"Wild Weekends\\". She also joined film crew as still photographer for the documentary \\"African Fusion\\" , a film about free solo climber Alex Honnold exploring some of the best climbing areas in South Africa. She continues to climb in Chile, Morocco and the Alps while eventually building her own photographic and framing business with Thys Dullaart, that provides high end conservation to art galleries and collectors. dlewisebrowne.co.za References External links *Interview with Duncan Souchon Category:Afrikaner people Category:South African mountain climbers Category:South African rock climbers Category:White South African people Category:South African people of Dutch descent Category:1976 births Category:Living people ","title":"Marianne Schwankhart"},{"id":"12402869","text":"The imitator salamander (Desmognathus imitator) is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to the Appalachian Mountains in the Eastern United States. Description The imitator salamander is dark brown or blackish, sometimes with a pale intermittent stripe down its back and a pale line joining eye to jaw. It often has red or orange cheek patches and its hind legs are more stocky than its forelegs. Distribution and habitat The imitator salamander is found in the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina at elevations more than above sea level. Its range extends from the Great Smoky Mountains in the north to the Plott Balsams and the Great Balsam Mountains in the south. Its habitat is the banks of streams, wet rocks, and the forest floor at higher altitudes. It shares its range with the Ocoee salamander (Desmognathus ocoee), but is usually found closer to water. Biology The imitator salamander is not toxic, but is thought to be a Batesian mimic of the red-cheeked salamander (Plethodon jordani), a noxious species. Specimen showing mimicry of the red-cheeked salamander Adult imitator salamanders hide during the day and emerge at night to forage for small invertebrates. They are probably preyed on by birds, mammals, snakes and the spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). The imitator salamander breeds in summer and a clutch of about 20 eggs is laid and attached to the underside of a rock in a seepage or other wet location. The female broods the eggs and when they hatch, the larvae may live among wet moss, under rocks and among leaf litter. Little is known of their development, but they are assumed to eat small invertebrates and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles around 10 months old. Status The imitator salamander is listed as \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, because, although the total size of the population is unknown, the number of salamanders seems to be stable. The species is offered some protection because most of its range is inside the boundaries of national parks, but a small separate population on Waterrock Knob is threatened by local extinction. The Great Smoky Mountains have a high deposition of acid rain, but no evidence shows this is affecting the salamander population.

It is endemic to the United States. Description The shovelnose salamander is a robust species, broad with a relatively short tail. It receives its name from the shape of its snout which is more square ended than as seen in other salamanders in its genus. The colour is a dusky brown, grey or black with two longitudinal rows of paler small patches and many smaller pale speckles. The underside is usually grey. Distribution and habitat The shovelnose salamander is found in the Appalachian Mountains in southeastern United States at above sea level. Its range includes the states of West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. It is found in shallow, flowing water, rapids and riffles on gravel and rocky substrates, but is not found in silted streams. Behaviour The shovelnose salamander is an aquatic species, living and feeding in moderately fast-flowing streams. Although it shares its range with the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus), the two species come into contact little, because the blackbelly mostly lies half out of the water and forages on land. The shovelnose salamander does not have a fixed home range nor exhibit territorial behaviour as does the blackbelly. Breeding takes place in late spring and early summer. The female attaches eggs singly or in small clumps to the underside of a rock in moving water. The eggs hatch after about eleven weeks and the larvae hide among the gravel particles and feed on aquatic invertebrates. They undergo metamorphosis into adults at two to three years of age and mature at about five. Status The shovelnose salamander is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it is presumed to have a large population and any decline in numbers is slow. It is affected by silting of the streams in which it lives through logging, agriculture and impoundment but occurs in a number of protected areas. Numbers are also reduced by its use by fishermen as bait.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater springs and wet rocks in mountainous areas of the Southeastern United States. It was first described by J. C. Nicholls in 1949.Nicholls, J.C. 1949. A new salamander of the genus Desmognathus from East Tennessee. Journ. Tenn. Acad. Sci., vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 127-129. Distribution and habitat The Ocoee salamander is found in two separate populations. The more numerous is in the Blue Ridge Mountains and at lower levels in the gorges of the rivers Hiwassee, Ocoee, Tugaloo and Tallulah. The less numerous population is in the Appalachian Plateau in northeastern Alabama. It is found over a greater range of altitudes than other members of the genus Desmognathus. At lower levels it is an aquatic species but at higher altitudes it is mostly terrestrial. It is found close to fast flowing mountain streams, in seepage areas, on moist forest floors and on wet rocks. In cove valleys in the Appalachian Mountains it prefers hardwood forests with trees that are more than eighty-five years old. Biology The Ocoee salamander maintains a small territory when on land which it defends against other members of its species. It feeds on insects and other small invertebrates and is itself preyed on by birds and snakes. When approached by a predator it may remain immobile or may flee and is prone to autotomize its tail. When attacked by a snake it may writhe about and bite it on the head. Breeding takes place in the summer. The female lays a clutch of about fifteen eggs in a damp crevice, under a rock or rotten log or among wet moss or leaf litter. She broods the eggs for one or two months after which the newly hatched larvae make their way to a stream, a seepage or rocks over which water is flowing. They feed on small aquatic invertebrates and undergo metamorphosis the following spring or summer. In the winter, adult and juvenile salamanders may occupy underground refuges. Status The Ocoee salamander is one of the commonest salamanders in the southern Appalachian Mountains. It is believed to have a large and stable population and much of its range lies in state parks or other protected areas. It faces few threats and is listed as being of \\"Least Concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It is endemic to the United States. Its natural habitats are rivers, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The blackbelly salamander is a medium-sized salamander growing to about long. It is sturdily built with a long tail. The ground colour is dark brown or black with two rows of small pale spots along each side of the back. The underside is usually black but may have pale flecks in young individuals. Distribution and habitat The blackbelly salamander is found in the Appalachian Mountains in southeastern United States. Its range extends from West Virginia, through southeastern Virginia, eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina and northern Georgia. It is a largely aquatic species and lives in cold mountain streams at heights of above sea level. Behaviour The blackbelly salamander spends more time in water than all other members of the genus except the shovelnose salamander (Desmognathus marmoratus). It mainly forages on land and has a home range of at least 1,200 square centimetres (190 square inches) but seldom travels more than from the stream. In this home range it has one or more refugia, crevices in the rock or burrow entrances in which it can conceal itself, ambushing small invertebrates as they pass by. It defends these refugia against other members of its own species. Breeding takes place in the late spring. The female attaches fifteen to forty eggs to the base of submerged boulders. The eggs hatch in about three months and the larvae develop slowly, undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile salamanders about three and a half years later. Ecology Several other species of salamander occupy the same range as the blackbelly salamander. These include the dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), the Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), and the seal salamander (Desmognathus monticola). Blackbelly and seal salamanders seem to actively avoid each other and it is possible that they use chemical cues to avoid coming into contact. They are sometimes attacked by garter snakes (Thamnophis sp.). The blackbelly salamander's defence strategies include its warning colouration (though it is not in fact toxic), remaining still in the hope a predator will fail to notice it, biting the aggressor, and shedding its tail (autotomy) as a distraction. Biting was successful against garter snakes and was also used against shrews. Status The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the blackbelly salamander as being of \\"Least Concern\\". The reasons given are that the population seems stable with an estimated number of at least 10,000 individuals. It might decline in some localities if streams become acidic as a result of mining activities, and in some places, fishermen capture it for use as bait.

Distribution and habitat It is endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains in the south-eastern United States. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, freshwater marshes and springs. The black mountain salamander is found in an area of the Appalachian Mountains covering about . Its range includes eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. It is found at heights varying from above sea level. Its natural habitat is wooded mountainous countryside where it hides under rocks and logs in swift flowing streams, pools, and wet ditches. It shares the same range as the seal salamander (Desmognathus monticola) and northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) which are both more terrestrial, and the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) which shares its aquatic habits. Description The black mountain salamander is one of a number of similar looking species of dusky salamanders inhabiting the upland locations in which it is found. It has a robust body about long with short, stout limbs. The colour is variable but the upper parts are usually pale or medium brown with an indistinct pattern of paler markings. The under side is whitish with dark spots and blotches. Reproduction Courtship behaviour is not known for the black mountain salamander but reproduction takes place in the spring or summer. The female lays clusters of eggs in or just beside small fast flowing streams, in moist crevices, and among wet leaves in the splash zone. About 25 eggs with short stalks are attached to one another like a bunch of grapes. The eggs have large yolks and the larvae develop for some time inside them. The female guards and broods the eggs until they hatch. The larvae are aquatic and usually occupy quiet shallow areas of streams. The larval period lasts twenty to twenty-four months. After metamorphosis, the juveniles seem to occupy rather deeper water than the adults or spend more time on land, perhaps to avoid competition or to avoid encounters with blackbelly salamanders, which are cannibalistic. Black mountain salamanders are believed to mature at four to five years, at a snout to vent length of about , and have been known to live for twenty years in captivity. Diet The black mountain salamander is very secretive during daytime and may largely forage at night. The diet largely consists of flies, beetles and other insects, and the larvae of flies, butterflies and moths. Status The population of black mountain salamanders seems to be stable or in slight decline although detailed studies have not been performed. The areas in which it occurs are not heavily populated and its habitat is not under threat. Road building and strip mining have caused an increase in silting in some areas and in West Virginia the salamander is probably now rare.

It is endemic to the United States in the southern Appalachians in North Carolina and Tennessee. Abstract Desmognathus wrighti is a member of the family Plethodontidae and is commonly known as the pygmy salamander. As the name suggest the pygmy salamander is the smallest of the nineteen species in the genus Desmognathus. D. wrighti undergoes direct development and does not have a free-living larval stage. Only two other taxa in Desmognathus, D. aeneus and D. organi, exhibit direct development along with the pygmy salamander.Hining, K. J. and R. C. Bruce. 2005. Population structure and life history attributes of syntopic populations of the salamanders Desmognathus aeneus and Desmognathus wrighti (Amphibia: Plethodontidae). Southeastern Naturalist, 4(4): 679-688 In the genus Desmognathus, body size, habitat preferences, and patterns used by males during courtship are quite variable. D. wrighti courtship is noted by the male biting and seizing its partner in order to provide them with a chemical stimulus.Verrel, P. 1999. Bracketing the extremes: courtship behaviour of the smallest- and largest-bodied species in the salamander genus Desmognathus (Plethodontidae: Desmognathinae). Journal of Zoology, 247: 105-111. The pygmy salamander can be found in the southern Appalachians of the United States in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Geographical distribution of the Desmognathus wrighti is fragmented and the highest abundance of the species can be found at high elevations in spruce and fir tree forest.Crespi, E. J., R. A. Robert, and L. J. Rissler. 2010. Taxonomic Revision of Desmognathus wrighti (Caudata: Plethodontidae). Herpetologica, 66(3): 283-295. Identification Desmognathus wrighti has a light belly with a gold-colored iridophore pattern that extends from the abdomen to the anterior of the cloacal vent. The salamander has a rounder snout and the total body length ranges from . The tail is not keeled and the body length is equal to or greater than the tail length. Pygmy salamanders are typically light brown with dark brown pigment on the dorsal side forming an inverted V-shape marking down the back This ‘V’ shape marking is a classic pigmentation marking. The salamander's color can range from brick red to yellow but usually is found as a light brown shade. The light stripe from the eye to the jaw designates the salamanders as a desmognathan. Desmognathus wrighti typically has six vomerine teeth on each side of the mouth along with premaxillary and mandible teeth. The maximum size of males and females has been determined to have no real difference in the species. General description and taxonomy Desmognathus wrighti was named and discovered by King in 1936. The pygmy salamander's natural habitat includes temperate forests, intermittent rivers, and freshwater springs. This species small size places it among the smallest salamanders in the world. D. wrighti adult size is in the range of the sizes of the genus Thorius, which are neo-tropical and considered the smallest urodeles in the world. The genus Desmognathus consists of nineteen species which all vary in body size, life history, and habitat. The most basic way of sorting the species in this genus is by body size and distance they are found from streams which they inhabit. In 2010, there was a taxonomic revision to Desmognathus wrighti. This revision was based on genetic and ecological analyses. This divergence has been reported by DNA sequencing, but further research shows several differences in the body type and ventral pigmentation. An ecological niche analysis was completed on two niches separated by the French Broad River and significant morphological variation was found between the two lineages. Findings show differences in snout-vent length, body condition, and head width, suggesting that there are two distinct and separately evolving lineages in Desmognathus wrighti. The diverging northern lineage, Desmognathus organi, is the new species described by Crespi and Browne in 2010. The revision to the taxonomic Desmognathus wrighti was seen needed for the northern pygmy salamander to reflect the genetic, ecological, and geographical differences in the two different populations located north and south of the French Broad River. The original species Desmognathus wrighti described by King more accurately describes the lineage from the southern part of the French Broad River and the morphological descriptions described on this page. The new species Desmognathus organi, the Northern pygmy salamander, is a sister taxon to D. wrighti. Differences of D. organi from its sister taxon includes a slightly larger body length, wider heads, and the ventral gold iridophore patterns are absent. Also, D. organi is found in higher elevations north of the French Broad River including Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. Geographical distribution Desmognathus wrighti has a very fragmented geographical distribution. The species is found in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee south of the French Broad River. In Tennessee, D. wrighti inhabits the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Blount, Cocke, and Sevier counties. The species is also found in the Cherokee National Forest in Monroe County. In North Carolina, the pygmy salamander is only documented in Graham County along the Tennessee border.Reynolds, R. G., M. L. Niemiller, and S. A. Pasachnik. 2011. Occurrence of pygmy salamanders (Desmognathus wrighti) in Monroe County, Tennessee. Journal of the Tennessee Academy of Science, 86(2): 53-55. The highest abundance of pygmy salamanders is found at higher elevations ranging from 1600 to 2082 meters. The distribution of the salamander primarily lies adjacent to areas of red spruce (Picea rubens) and Fraser's fir (Abies fraseri) forests at these high elevations. However, pygmy salamanders populations can be found at lower elevations from 950 to 1400 meters, but the highest densities occur at the higher elevations.Crespi, E. J., L. J. Rissler, and R. A. Browne. 2003. Testing Pleistocene refugia theory: phylogeographical analysis of Desmognathus wrighti, a high-elevation salamander in the southern Appalachians. Molecular Ecology, 12(4): 969-984. Desmognathus wrighti populations appear to have stayed fragmented for some time due to their restriction to high elevation. The lower elevation populations of the pygmy salamanders documented exhibit little gene flow. This low gene flow reflects their preference for higher elevation and possible competition with other Appalachian salamanders. In its known geographical locations the pygmy salamander can primarily be found in moist depressions such as under logs and rocks along streams, in damp leaf litter, and in mossy areas. Ecology Desmognathus wrighti is typically a light brown color with a dorsal pigmentation pattern of inverted V's in a darker brown. The salamander ranges from 35 mm to 55 mm and rarely exceeds 50 mm making it the smallest salamander in the genus Desmognathus. Pygmy salamanders are typically found at higher elevations. Adult salamanders are active at night and have been found up to one meter above the ground in vegetation. The pygmy salamander is the most terrestrial species of its genus. It lives in depressions in moss and leaf litter on the forest floors and is most often found in spruce-fir forests of high elevation. The salamander goes to seepages and stream banks for egg-laying in summer and early autumn.Bruce, R. C. 1977. The pygmy salamander, Desmognathus wrighti (Amphibia, Urodela, Plethodontidae), in the Cowee Mountains, North Carolina. Journal of Herpetology, 11(2): 246-247. Life history and behavior D. wrighti courtship differs from other members of Desmognathus in the phenology of oviposition which is in late summer into autumn. Males reach sexual maturity by their second or third year while females reach their sexual maturity by their third year. Males normally have two testes lobes but this number can increase with body size. In courtship males use their vomerine teeth to bite the female which in turn allows pheromone secretion to enter directly into the female circulation. D. wrighti and D. aeneus are the only two desmognathine salamanders that exhibit the courtship that which the male bite and seizes its partner before behaviors exhibited to accomplish sperm transfer. The male approaches the female quickly, bites, and tugs as he begins to undulate his tail. The female in return turns towards the male and places her chin on his laterally undulating tail so that they rotate in full circle. Typically in courtship behavior a Plethodontidae characteristic tail-straddling walk follows. In the tail-straddling walk, the male release the female and slides his head under her chin, then her forelimbs straddle the male's tail and the pair then move forward. The male then deposits a spermatophore on the ground which is followed by the female picking up a sperm cap with her cloacal lips as she moves forward undulating her pelvic area.Organ, J. A. 1961. Life History of the Pigmy Salamander, Desmognathus wrighti, in Virginia. The University of Notre Dame. American Midland Naturalist, 66(2): 384-390. Desmognathus wrighti females have an average clutch size of 8 to 9 eggs which are suspended by a single attachment stalk and develop between 4 and 25 oocytes. Females lay eggs in banks of streams in areas of saturated gravel. The females also typically remain close to their egg mass and coil their bodies around the mass. Eggs change from spheroid shape to ovoids when hatching conditions occur. The embryo then thrusts itself against the capsule and rotates within the egg until it escapes from the egg fluid. D. wrighti hatchlings are not larvae and have gills in late embryonic stages. At hatching the ventral side is unpigmented and the characteristic ‘V’ pigmentation is found on the dorsal side. The characteristic stripe from the eye to the jaw is also present in late embryo and hatching stages. Conservation Desmognathus wrighti was assess in 2004 as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, in light of the species having a wide distribution, a large population, and being unlikely to decline fast enough to be placed in a more threaten category. Threats to the pygmy salamander include deforestation of spruce-fir forest. Acid rain is also a threat at the high elevation that can destroy the spruce-fir trees in the pygmy salamander's natural habitat.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate shrubland, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, arable land, and urban areas. It is more water-oriented than the related northern redback salamander, and can often be found in and around water such as rain puddles, streams, swamps, and damp stream beds, whereas the northern redback tends to be found in damp ground, but usually not near open water. Description The northern two-lined salamander is a small salamander, with adults ranging from 65–120 mm in total length.Petranka, J.W. (1998). Salamanders of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution Press. pp. 587. This salamander is yellow or yellowish-brown, with two black stripes running down the back which tends to break up after the base of the tail. The flanks are mottled grayish or brown.MacCulloch, R.D. (2002). The ROM field guide to amphibians and reptiles of Ontario. Royal Ontario Museum, McClelland and Stewart, Toronto, Ontario. pp.168.

University of Michigan Press. pp. 327. On the side of the body are 14–16 costal grooves. Habitat and distribution This species prefers small rocky streams or seeps in forests, but may occur in moist areas far from running water. Also, some data suggest this species may be found on stony shores of small lakes and rivers.Cook, F. (1984). Introduction aux amphibiens et reptiles du Canada. Musee Nationaux du Canada. Ottawa. pp. 211 Northern two-lined salamanders are found throughout northeastern North America, ranging from central and southern Quebec, New Brunswick, northeastern Ontario, and the northeastern United States, from central Virginia and Ohio northwards to the Great Lakes. Compared to many other species in the genus Eurycea, E. bislineata has a large geographic distribution. Reproduction The reproductive strategy of the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position for an hour or more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male's tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male's sperm.Noble, G.K. (1929). The relationship of courtship to the secondary sexual characteristic of the two-lined salamander. American Museum Novitates 362:1-5. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5 mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.Organ, J.A. and L.A. Lowenthal. (1963). Comparative studies of macroscopic and microscopic features of spermatophores of some plethodontid salamanders. Copeia 1963:659-669. This species exhibits sexual dimorphism in the shape of the premaxillary teeth. The teeth of breeding males are unicuspid and elongated when compared to the shorter bicuspid teeth of the females. These enlarged teeth are used to help abrade the female's skin and introduce the secretions on the males mental gland, found on the chin, into her circulatory system, which stimulates her to mate.Kozak, K.H. (2003). Sexual isolation and courtship behavior in salamanders of the Eurycea bislineata species complex, with comments on the evolution on the evolution of the mental gland and pheromone delivery behavior in the Plethodontidae. Southeastern Naturalist 2:281-292 Prior to egg laying, the female searches for a suitable oviposition site in the stream. Nest sites are frequently under rocks, sometimes logs, and perhaps vegetation. Research done in the Georgia Piedmont on the closely related E. cirrigera, indicate that 65% of nests found were under cobbles (2.5 to 30 cm), 16% were under boulders (greater that 30 cm), and 19% were under slate tiles (30x30x1 cm), which were added to the stream experimentally.Guy,C.J., R.E. Ratajczak, G.D. Grossman. 2004. Nest-site selection by southern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea cirrigera) in the Georgia Piedmont. Southeastern Naturalist. 3:75-88. To deposit eggs on the under surface of a rock, the female must flip on her back to make cloacal contact with the substrate. Three minutes is required to lay each egg in this manner, and up to several hours to lay an entire clutch. The eggs, when freshly laid appear white or pale yellowish, and each egg is 2.5–3 mm in diameter and is surrounded by two distinct membranes.

Larval ecology Upon hatching, the gilled larva are about 10 mm long, and remain in slow- moving pools, or less frequently, hiding in crevices between rocks and boulders in swift-flowing streams.Barr, G.E. and K.J. Babbitt (2002). Effects of biotic and abiotic factors of the distribution and abundance of larval two- lined salamanders (Eurycea bislineata) across spatial scales. Oecologica 133:176-185 The larvae do not begin feeding until their yolk sacs are reabsorbed, at which point they begin to feed on benthic invertebrates by prowling the bottom of the stream. Typical prey items for northern two-lined salamander larvae include chironomid larvae and other dipteran larvae, stonefly larvae, cladocera, and copepods. Predators of the larvae are many, such as fish, crayfish, and other salamander larvae, such as the larger northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). The larval period of E. bislineata is variable depending on latitude. In the southern portion of their range, such as New York, metamorphosis occurs at 50 mm total length or two years old, while further north, such as in Quebec and likely Ontario, metamorphosis takes place at nearly 70 mm total length, or three years old.Trapido, H. and R.T. Clausen (1940). The larvae of Eurycea bislineata major. Copeia 1940:244-246. The larvae over-winter in deeper pools not prone to freezing. Adult ecology Once the larvae reach their maximum size, metamorphosis occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at three to four years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted to the stream edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day.Crocker,J.B., M.S. Bank, C.S. Loftin, R.E. Jung Brown (2007). Influence of observers and stream flow on northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata bislineata) relative abundance estimates in Acadia and Shenandoah National Parks, USA. Journal of Herpetology 41: 325-329 Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, but they tend to remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather.MacCulloch, R.D. and J.R. Bider. (1975). Phenology, migrations, circadian rhythm and the effect of precipitation on the activity of (Eurycea bislineata bislineata) in Quebec. Herpetologica 31:433-439. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, stonefly nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry.Holomuzki, J.R. (1980). Synchronous foraging and dietary overalp of three species of Plethodontid salamanders. Herpetologica 36(2):109-115. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2.Burton, T.M. and G.E. Likens (1975). Salamander populations and biomass in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Copeia 975:54. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2.Stewart, M.M. (1968). Population dynamics of Eurycea bislineata in New York. Journal of Herpetology 2:176-177. Adults overwinter up to 80 cm deep into the soil of the stream bank in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period. Predators and defense Because of its small size and localized distribution around streams, the northern two-lined salamander is preyed upon by a variety of animals. Predators include birds, such as the eastern screech owl (Otus asio), snakes such as the eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) and ringneck snakes (Diadophis punctatus). Other important predators of the northern two-lined salamander larvae are other salamanders, such as the large, stream-dwelling larvae of the northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) and the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). Response to a predator is variable in E. bislineata . Some individuals, when confronted with a garter snake, will remain motionless when contacted by the head of the snake, but would engage in a protean flip, where the tail is held over the body when contacted by the snake's tongue.Ducey, P.K. and E.D. Brodie. (1983). Salamanders respond selectively to contacts with snakes: survival advantages of alternative antipredator strategies. Copeia 1983:1036-1041 Tail autotomy is common in E. bislineata , as a result of a struggle with a predator. Losing part of the tail increases the likelihood of surviving the encounter with a predator. In some populations, up to 32% of animals had autotomized tails.

It was first described by David M. Sever, Harold M. Dundee, and Charles D. Sullivan who found the species in the range from the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. Adults of this species can be found near large, rocky streams and on rainy nights on roads in the areas specified. The salamander is characterized by brownish-yellow coloration with a series of small dots along the body and a robust build compared to the other salamanders in Eurycea. The Junaluska salamander's breeding habits tend to be in large streams where the eggs are laid and attached to the bottom of rocks in the streams where they are found. According to the overall conservation listing for IUCN, this species is listed as Vulnerable. Conservation acts are important in both North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, since the population of this species in each state is so small. Diagnosis Eurycea junaluska has a brownish dorsum with small dots or wavy lines along the body. An easy way to distinguish E. junaluska from E. bislineata is E. junaluska has a more robust body, longer forelimbs, and a shorter tail. Also, Sever and his colleagues studied the teeth series and discovered E. junaluska possesses a longer prevomerine teeth series. In addition to these traits, a wavy, broken, black stripe up to 0.80 mm wide extends from the nostril through the eye and through the sides of the body and tail. The front limbs contain four toes and the back limbs contain five toes. Nasolabial grooves are present and the number of coastal grooves usually ranges from 13 to 15. No phylogenetic trees are available for this species to date. The specific name junaluska was chosen to honor a Cherokee chief who was prominent in North Carolina's history, Junaluska. The area Chief Junaluska was given contains a good amount of the range of where the species exists in North Carolina, which is the reason for the naming of the salamander. Fossil record There is no fossil record found in literature to date. Geographic distribution Junaluska salamanders have only been found in the Blue Ridge Mountain area in the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee. These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One looking for this species is more likely to find E. junaluska in larger rocky streams in colder weather. Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night driving along roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed. Ecology Larvae are not numerous in larger streams, possibly because of the abundance of trout; predation by trout and other species of fish can affect the populations of E. junaluska. Competition with other salamanders can also be a factor. The junaluska salamander is thought to feed on smaller invertebrates found in the stream and forest areas they inhabit. Currently, interactions with other species are not well studied for this species. Life events The larval life history of E. junaluska is still not very well known. Studies have found the breeding season is spread from fall to early spring. The larval period reportedly lasts around two to three years, and metamorphosis occurs during the summer months. Eggs are laid in the streams and are attached under media such as large rocks. The depth of the eggs laid range from 6–20 cm. The adult salamanders stay around where the eggs are laid to protect the egg clutch. Clutch sizes range from 30 to 50 eggs. The larvae are completely aquatic until they metamorphose into adults. The larvae can easily be distinguished as other Eurycea species, so it is important to distinguish them correctly. A successful method of discovering the larvae is by using leaf mats placed in the streams underneath or near rocks. This allowed surveyors to receive data on the egg clutches and adult salamanders. Conservation According to the IUCN, the species is declared vulnerable overall. The main conservation threat to the junaluska salamanders is human disturbances, such as logging, road construction, and development in urban areas. These disturbances affect the water quality and therefore affect the small populations of this rare species. The disruption of the breeding sites of the junaluska can interrupt the breeding time between fall and early spring that could be detrimental to the larval population. North Carolina and Tennessee have different listings for this species in respect to the conservation concerns for the species. In North Carolina, E. junaluska is said to be state threatened and a federal species of special concern. In Tennessee, the species is listed as imperiled and deemed in need of management. Conservation efforts are important for this species, since it is endemic to the United States, particularly in North Carolina and Tennessee. Also, it is important to conserve them since the population is said to be less than 1,000 individuals overall.

History Bridge The B&O; Railroad's first bridge across the Ohio River, built in 1857, served a rail line through Parkersburg, West Virginia. But the growing center of Chicago, Illinois, made a span between Benwood, West Virginia, and Bellaire more desirable. In 1865, the B&O; obtained the Central Ohio Railroad and later the Sandusky, Mansfield & Newark Railroad. These acquisitions linked Bellaire to the port of Sandusky on the shore of Lake Erie, and thence to Chicago. The proposal to build a bridge at Bellaire threatened a ferry business there, whose owners sought and obtained an injunction was filed in court. The railroad fought the injunction to the U.S. Supreme Court and won. Discussions into the building of the bridge began in the late 1860s and it was decided that the bridge would be a long-span wrought-iron-truss. The design of the bridge was handled by Jacob Linville, president of the Keystone Bridge Co., which manufactured its trusses. The bridge was completed in 1871. The approaches are made of cut sandstone blocks that elevate the rail line to the recommended height. The bridge itself consists of all wrought-iron trusswork resting on six cut stone piers sunk into the river bed. The bridge was featured in the 2010 film Unstoppable starring Denzel Washington. Filming on the bridge in Bellaire ran from November 9 to 14, 2009.http://www.wtov9.com/news/21561836/detail.html Bridge spans The span in Benwood, West Virginia The spans to the bridge were completed in 1870. The Bellaire span contains 43 arched spans measuring wide and varying from in height over the roadways of downtown Bellaire. The span comes down from the north and curves at 6 degrees to the east. Each span contains 37 stones, representing the 37 states at the time of completion. The span in Benwood contains stone piers with iron truss-work supporting the railway above. The span comes in from the south and curves 270 degrees to the west. The span traverses several manufacturing sites and comes within feet of West Virginia Route 2. In total, the entire span contains of masonry, the piers and abutments contain . The bridge span is in length and the total cost was over $1,000,000.

Subspecies There are two or three subspecies: * E. l. longicauda (Green, 1818) (long-tailed salamander, eastern long-tailed salamander) * E. l. melanopleura (Cope, 1894 \\"1893\\") (dark-sided salamander, black-sided salamander, Cope's cave salamander) * E. l. pernix Mittleman, 1942 (Midland long-tailed salamander) Eurycea guttolineata has earlier been treated as a subspecies of Eurycea longicauda (that is, as E. l. guttolineata), but is now considered a full species. The dark-sided subspecies from Ozark County, Missouri Description Body color varies from yellow to orange-red to red with random black spots. E. l. longicauda measure on average snout–vent length (SVL) and have long tail. Reproduction E. l. melanopleura reproduces in November to February. The eggs measure in diameter. The larvae hatch in January–March at about snout–vent length (SVL). They metamorphose seven months later at SVL. Males become sexually mature between SVL and females SVL. The largest males and females are SVL. Habitat and conservation Eurycea longicauda inhabit streamsides, spring runs, ponds, cave mouths, and abandoned mines. With wet weather, they may venture into wooded terrestrial habitats. They hide in rock crevices or under rocks, logs, etc. Eggs are laid in underground crevices associated with aquatic environments, but in caves they may also be attached to objects in or above water. The overall population size of this species is large (probably more than 100,000). Some local populations may have been impacted by strip mining and acid drainage from coal mining, but there are no major threats overall. Its range overlaps with several protected areas.

It is endemic to springs in Williamson County, Texas, near Lake Georgetown. It inhabits freshwater springs and, possibly, caves. It is threatened by habitat loss. Many of the springs where this species formerly lived have been destroyed by development, including creation of Lake Georgetown. The specific name (which means \\"remnants\\" in Latin) refers to the few remaining remnants of habitat for this species. Description Georgetown salamanders are small, permanently aquatic salamanders. Adults are typically in length and less than 0.5 cm in diameter. Although their coloration varies, most adults are dark brown, dark olive, or gray. Juveniles tend to be darker in color. Coloration is confined to the dorsal and lateral sides of the body; the ventral surface is usually translucent. Many individuals have a light, cream- or yellow- colored stripe on the top of the tail. The head is roughly shovel-shaped, broad but relatively short, and widest at the point where the upper and lower jaws meet. Three prominent external gills—often deep red in color—extend from each side of the head. The eyes are relatively large and have gold-colored irises. Black melanophores are concentrated around each eye, forming a black circle around the eye and a black line that runs from the corner of the eye to the nasal opening. There are 14-16 costal grooves, counting those in the fore limb and hind limb regions. Chippindale et al. (2000) described the osteology of the species and how it differs from that of E. tonkawae and E. chisholmensis. Distribution The Georgetown salamander is associated with wet caves and springs in the San Gabriel River watershed in Williamson County, Texas. Salamanders have been observed at 14 locations in the county. These locations include some historical records; ongoing studies are taking place at two of the locations. Within the spring flows, the majority of salamanders are observed within a few meters of the spring origin. Life history Most amphibians have biphasic lifecycles, spending part of their lives in water and part on land. However, the Georgetown salamander is permanently aquatic and retains its gills and flattened tail throughout its life. This retention of juvenile traits, called neoteny, is a fairly common trait within the genus Eurycea. The Georgetown salamander is active year-round. The Georgetown salamander is believed to reproduce in the winter, as many other Eurycea species do. The salamanders produce an estimated 30 to 50 eggs per clutch, but likely lay them individually. The hatchlings are about 1 cm long and grow rapidly until they reach a head-trunk length of about 3 cm. At this point, growth is slowed and some salamanders may even shrink a small amount. The juvenile stage is typically two months to three years. Similar species live for five to 15 years, though the exact lifespan of the Georgetown salamander is unknown. Conservation All known populations of the Georgetown salamander occur in an area undergoing rapid urbanization. Current threats to the salamander include depletion and pollution of the Edward's Aquifer, which supplies the springs and caves in which the salamander occurs. Increases in impervious cover associated with urbanization decrease recharge of the aquifer and increase runoff and introduction of pollutants into the aquifer. Pumping of groundwater further depletes the aquifer. Sedimentation associated with land clearing and construction is another threat to the salamanders, as they are critically dependent on the presence of interstitial spaces that are eliminated by sediment. At present, only one population of the Georgetown salamander is located in a protected preserve. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulates activities affecting water quality for the Edwards Plateau; however, TCEQ's regulations do not address such aspects as land use, impervious cover limitations, nonpoint-source pollution, or application of fertilizers and pesticides over the recharge zone. All of these represent threats to the Georgetown salamander's habitat. Listing process In 2011, several groups, including WildEarth Guardians and the Center for Biological Diversity, sued the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on the grounds that the Service had not met deadlines to decide on listings for a number of candidate species, including the Georgetown salamander. Settlement of the case resulted in a commitment from USFWS to review the candidate species by 2016. In 2011, the USFWS announced that Eurycea naufragia, along with three other Eurycea species found in central Texas (E. chisholmensis, E. tonkawae, and E. waterlooensis) would undergo the formal review for possible listing as an endangered species. This process is currently in progress.

Since there was already a canton called Mora, this one was named Moravia.Cantón de Moravia Municipalidad de Moravia. Retrieved: 2012-03-13.  History  Moravia was created on 1 August 1914 by decree 55. Law No. 55 established Villa San Vicente on 1 August 1914. The first session of the Council of Moravia was held on 19 January 1915, and the first electric street lighting was installed in the same year. Law No. 3248 gave the town of San Vicente city status on 6 December 1963.  Geography  Moravia has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres. The elongated canton begins in the northern suburbs of the national capital city of San José and continues northeast toward the Cordillera Central (Central Mountain Range). The Virilla, Pará, and Blanco rivers on the north and west, and the Quebrada Azul and Macho rivers on the southeast, partially delineate the boundaries of the canton.Map of Moravia Atlas Cantonal de Costa Rica, 1985. Other rivers in Moravia include Quebrada Barreal, Quebrada Lajas, Quebrada San Francisco, Quebrada Tornillal, Quebrada Yerbabuena, Acequia, Agrá, Hondura, Ipís, Pará Grande, Paracito, and Zurquí. Mountain peaks in the area include Zurquí (1,583m), Vargas (1,396m), and Trina (1,270m). Moravia combines densely populated suburbs in the south with rural mountain landscapes in the San Jerónimo district to the north. The cantons surrounding Moravia are Vázquez de Coronado to the east and north, San Isidro, Santo Domingo, and Tibás to the west, and Goicoechea to the south.  Districts  The canton of Moravia is subdivided into the following districts: # San Vicente # San Jerónimo # La Trinidad  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Moravia had a population of inhabitants. Education The first school was founded in 1848, called \\"school for the education of the children of the residents of San Vicente\\", and was located on the north side of the current San Vicente city park, called Parque de Moravia. A charity school was created in 1862, with two sections, one for boys and one for women. In 1891, an adobe and brick building was created for the school and this was renamed Escuela Graduada de Varones de San Vicente (Graduate School for Boys of Saint Vincent) in 1893. Two years later, the name Graduada de Mujeres de San Vicente (Graduate School of Women of Saint Vincent) was added and these names were maintained until 1932, when the school was renamed again as Escuela Porfirio Brenes Castro, its current name. The school Porfirio Brenes Castro now occupies a city block to the south of Parque de Moravia.

Description This salamander resembles the Tennessee cave salamander (Gyrinophilus palleucus) but grows to a larger size, has a more spatulate snout, a broader head and more pigmentation. The premaxilla bones at the tip of the snout are completely divided in adults of this species while they are not in the Tennessee cave salamander.

Habitat This species is mainly found on soft bottoms in the sublittoral zone, and occasionally on the littoral fringe, where it is sometimes found alive at low tide. It does not adapt well to life in the intertidal zone, due to its intolerance for low salinities. If exposed to air, it may crawl from its shell, risking desiccation. Shell A shell of B. undatum Buccinum undatum Linnaeus, 1758 – museum specimen This species' solid, ovate-conical, ventricose shell is very pale, white, yellowish or reddish. In life, the shell is covered in a bright, yellowish-brown periostracum. The spire contains seven or eight whorls. These are convex and crossed by oblique folds, thick and waved. The shell surface has a sculpture of vertical, wavy folds (hence the name undatum, which means wavy). The wavy folds are crossed by numerous incised, very prominent spiral lines, some of which are paired. The white and very large aperture of the shell is broadly oval and tapers to a deeply notched siphonal canal. The outer lip is arched. The maximum height of the shell is 10 cm and the maximum width is 6 cm. The animal emits a thin and copious slime.G.W. Tryon, Systematic Conchology vol. I, Philadelphia, 1882 This species is very variable in size, and also in its form, which is more or less inflated. In many cases the oblique folds are not apparent, and sometimes the transverse striae have wholly disappeared. The epidermis is of a deep brown. It varies also in its coloring, which in some specimens is of a bright yellow or violet, surrounded with one or several reddish bands.Kiener (1840).

Ecology and population decline Disappearing or diminishing populations of whelks have been observed since the early 1970s, especially in the North Sea and the Wadden Sea. Additionally, vast beds of empty shells have been discovered where no living whelks are present. Imposex, the occurrence of male gonads on female whelks, has been detected since the early 1990s, and is thought to be a product of the shipping industry. Specifically, TBT has been shown to reduce viability of whelk populations.Mensink, B.P., Everaarts, J.M., Kralt, H., ten Hallers-Tjabbes, C.C., & Boon, J.P.

Its natural habitats are streams in caves. It is threatened by habitat destruction. Distribution The Tennessee cave salamander inhabits the southern Cumberland Plateau in the Appalachian Mountains in the United States. Its range includes south-central Tennessee, western North Carolina, northeastern Alabama, northwestern Alabama and northwestern Georgia. The salamander lives in cave systems, and is probably present in some systems as yet unexplored. Ecology The salamander's diet consists of amphipods and other small aquatic invertebrates that live in caves. It occurs on sand, gravel, mud or rock, in streams, in rimstone pools and in isolated pools. It prefers clear water without sediment. It is occasionally seen outside caves but it is thought that this occurs when it has been accidentally washed out by floodwater. This species is usually paedomorphic. This means it remains in the larval state for all of its life. Paedomorphic individuals breed as larvae, but some individuals continue to develop and undergo metamorphosis in the usual way. Status G. palleucus lives in caves and is dependent on the quality of the water in the streams that flow through them. Threats it faces include pollution, siltation, flooding, increased water flow and the filling of sinkholes and dumping of trash. This salamander is known from about two dozen sites but probably occurs in other cave systems. Its total area of occupancy is less than and its population in Custard Hollow Cave in Tennessee seems to be decreasing.

Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster. and this salamander has also been called the purple salamander.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, swamps, freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, inland karsts, and caves. In addition to insects, worms, and other small invertebrates, the fairly large spring salamander may also consume smaller stream dwelling salamanders such as two-lined and dusky salamanders. Although deforestation is a potential threat, the spring salamander occurs in many protected areas and is not listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List. Description Like all members of the family Plethodontidae these salamanders have a nasolabial groove. The subspecies G. p. porphyriticus and G. p. duryi can be long. The record length is . The light line from eye to nostril is bordered below by gray pigment, but the markings are not always conspicuous. The dorsal coloration varies from salmon or light brownish to pink or reddish. The ground color has a cloudy appearance, and the darker markings are vague. The subspecies G. p. danielsi and G. p. dunni can be . The record length is . The white line from eye to nostril, bordered below by a conspicuous black or dark brown line, is distinctive. There also may be a dark line above the white line, often conspicuous. The dorsal coloration can be clear reddish, salmon, or orange-yellow marked with black or brown spots or flecks. Habitat This species is found in cool springs and mountain springs, but is also likely to be found in any wet depression beneath logs, stones, or leaves in the surrounding forest. Geographic range Its distribution ranges from southern Quebec to northern Alabama and extremely northeast Mississippi. There is also an isolated colony in Hamilton County, Ohio. G. p. duryi is present in southern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and western Virginia. The distribution range of G. p. danielsi is the southern Appalachian Mountains and the adjacent Piedmont from North Carolina to Alabama. G. p. dunni is distributed through the southern portion of the Blue Ridge Province and the Piedmont from southwest North Carolina to eastern to central Alabama. The nominate subspecies, G. p. porphyriticus, occupies the remainder of the geographical range of this species.

It is one of the numerous festivals that gave the name \\"baro mase tero parban\\" (thirteen festivals in twelve months ) to the land of Bengal. Although the nabanna parban is somewhat different from other ones since it is not connected to a religion such as Ratha Yatra. The villagers and locals from both the major religious groups join the festival with equal participation. There are also several fertility rituals which make the festival truly a harvest ritual. The festival gets a lot of support from the creative army of Bengali culture. Several poets, musicians, baul and painters flock to such mass gatherings.

It is endemic to the south-eastern United States where its natural habitats are inland karsts, caves and subterranean habitats (other than caves). It is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat loss. Taxonomy The Georgia blind salamander was originally described as a member of the monotypic genus Haideotriton, but was later placed in the genus Eurycea. Distribution The Georgia blind salamander is found in underground habitats in the Southeastern United States. Its precise distribution is unknown, however the first specimen to be examined scientifically was discovered in 1939 in water pumped from a deep well in Albany, Georgia. The only other locality in Georgia from which it is known is the Climax Cave, near Climax, Georgia, in Decatur County. The salamander is also known from at least eight locations near Marianna in Jackson County, Florida. All these locations are connected to the Floridan aquifer, a vast system of underground water-filled passageways in limestone which underlies much of the Southeastern United States. Biology Very little is known about the biology of this salamander. It feeds on ostracods, amphipods, isopods, copepods and other small aquatic prey. It frequents caverns where bats roost where bat droppings may fall into the water. Females with developing eggs have been found in May and November and it is thought that breeding may take place at any time of year. It appears to remain neotenic (breeding in its larval state) and no metamorphosised individuals have ever been found. The Dougherty Plain blind crayfish (Cambarus cryptodytes) is often found in the same habitat and may prey on the salamander, and fish such as the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and the Redeye Chub (Notropis harperi) are also likely predators. Habitat and conservation The locations in which the Georgia blind salamander are found are connected by the Floridan aquifer and it is presumed that it is by this means that populations are linked. The water is usually clear, but may become cloudy after heavy rain, and remains at throughout the year. Two of the caves in which this species was found at one time have since been destroyed. Other caves in the Florida Caverns State Park are protected and in these, populations of the salamander seem stable. The IUCN considers this species vulnerable. Threats include pollution from agricultural activities and changes in the water table due to the extraction of water from the aquifer. There is a possibility that populations may be impacted by over-removal for scientific purpose or by collectors. Motion It is blind, and uses its tail and ears to \\"see\\" where it is going. It moves weirdly, as expecting to be attacked at any time.

The five bay facade has a central six panel door with sidelights and a transom, and a metal hood covering supported by consoles. Four pair of French doors with unusual glazing and full length louvered shutters flank the central entry. The curved or domed windows in these doors distort the view and are considered unique in Ohio. , the interior was in excellent and near original condition. Original features including plaster cornices and medallions, poplar woodwork and porcelain key hole covers remained. In addition to the main house built in 1862, additions and other structures and features from 1930 are historically significant. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 10, 1986. History Thomas H. Bagby was a lawyer and public official of some notoriety in Seneca County, Ohio. Arriving from New York in 1845 when he was 22 before building this house he had built a Gothic Revival style house on North Sandusky in 1855. Bagby purchased of land on the outskirts of Tiffin along the Sandusky River in 1862 when he built what came to be known as the Bagby–Hossler House there. The domed glass was reportedly to distort the view of his jealously guarded wife. These unique windows are a reflection of the sophistication of the glass industry in Ohio at the time. Bagby gained a measure of notoriety when appointed as a county commissioner in 1882 local newspaper editor O.T. Locke purported the selection of Arthur L. Hossler Sr. as architect for the county courthouse was fixed. Bagby went on to win election as commissioner in 1884 and served until 1891, dying in 1906. Bagby's widow died in 1915 and the property had suffered some deterioration by 1930 when Arthur Hassler purchased it from her estate. Hossler did extensive renovations and improvements to the property. Hossler, born in Seneca County in 1882, began building houses in 1914. He went on to form a contracting company with his brothers that moved into larger commercial and civic construction. Hossler Brothers was still an active and significant construction firm in the county.

Discovered in 1952, this species belongs to the only genus of salamanders found both in New and Old World. It is endemic to a portion of the Merced River Canyon in Mariposa County, California. Description The limestone salamander has a flattened body, head, webbed toes, and a short tail. It is typically 5.0-7.5 cm in length. Adults are brownish with a pale ventral surface; the male has oval-shaped mental gland. The species was originally thought to be life-birthing, but is now known to lay eggs. Young hatch in the egg and emerge fully formed, with no larval stage. They are yellowish greenish, darkening with age. Like all lungless salamanders, it respires through its skin. Distribution and habitat The genus Hydromantes is endemic to California. The limestone salamander occurs only in the Lower Merced River drainage, in several disparate localities, at elevations of 300–760 m in inhabits canyon slopes that are greater than 35 degrees. Habitats include moss-covered limestones outcroppings, chaparral, under rocks and logs in moist environments. During dry weather it stays underground in caves and rock crevices. Conservation The limestone salamander is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, mostly because it is known from fewer than five locations (where the species appears to be uncommon but not rare). Under the Department of the Interior, US Fish and Wildlife, its Federal listing status is currently under review. The species is listed as Threatened by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife under the State Endangered Species Act. A proposed gold operation mine in Hell Hollow is thought to be the most immediate threat, in addition to general habitat loss due to construction of highways, quarries and dams. A portion of the Merced River Canyon is protected by the State of California and managed by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as the Limestone Salamander Ecological Reserve (~120 acres); a further 1,600 acres have been designated as the Limestone Salamander Area of Critical Environmental Concern.

It is endemic to Mexico. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and rocky areas and it is threatened by habitat loss. Description Ixalotriton niger is a long, slender salamander with a wide head, protuberant eyes, long limbs, large hands and feet and a long, gradually tapering tail. It grows to a total length of nearly and is a glossy black colour. At night it changes to a chocolate brown colour. The snout may have a small white patch and the tips or the toes are red, perhaps because of an absence of pigment allowing the vascular tissue below to show through. Distribution and habitat Ixalotriton niger is found at about above sea level on the Atlantic side of the Northern Highland Mountains in Chiapas State in south west Mexico. The area where it is endemic is composed of fissured limestone crags clothed in an evergreen forest rich in epiphytes including mosses, ferns, bromeliads, philodendrons and orchids. Behaviour Ixalotriton niger is an arboreal species that was first described in 1989. It is an elusive species and scrambles around on the trunks of trees and is capable of jumping in a lizard-like manner when disturbed. It readily autotomizes its tail to escape predators and can also produce a noxious sticky secretion from glands. There is no aquatic larval stage and the young develop directly inside the egg. Status Ixalotriton niger is considered \\"Endangered\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because its range is only about and the forest where it lives is being disturbed by logging. It was believed to be extinct, but in 2000 ten specimens were located. It was surveyed again in 2006 and 2007 and on both occasions, no specimens were found. However, the nights were wet and the salamanders may have moved higher into the canopy.

The novel uses two alternating first person narratives—the first told from the point of view of Fatale, a female cyborg recruited by the superhero group The New Champions as they investigate the disappearance of a superhero named CoreFire. The other narrative is told from the point of view of Dr. Impossible, a supervillain possessing super- human strength and intellect who suffers from Malign Hypercognition Disorder (\\"evil genius\\" syndrome). The plot follows Impossible's thirteenth attempt to take over the world after escaping from prison. The novel—Grossman's first—was written during his tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines generally associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008. Background The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is the first novel by Austin Grossman, an established video games designer. Grossman had come from a literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He always had an interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him in the form of a supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time the book was being published, Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's doctoral program studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. Plot After CoreFire, the world's greatest superhero, goes missing, the former members of The Champions re-unite to investigate his disappearance, bringing in two new replacement heroines, Lily and Fatale. They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, even though he has been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination. The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced he is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life. Fatale observes the actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable replacing a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans. The climax is reached on Dr. Impossible's island, as he attempts to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat can really be achieved, as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan. Main characters *Dr. Impossible, the supervillain narrator. The novel chronicles his escape from maximum security prison and his thirteenth attempt at world conquest. He is the \\"smartest man in the world.\\" A lab accident involving 'zeta radiation' gave him superpowers, consisting of super-reflexes, reasonable super-strength, and toughened skin. He was diagnosed with Malign Hypercognition Disorder. He is a pastiche of Lex Luthor and Doctor Doom. *Fatale, the superhero narrator. A rookie hero recruited by the New Champions, she is a cyborg, the result of experimental surgery following a near-fatal accident in São Paulo. She eventually discovers that the corporation responsible for creating and maintaining her cybernetic parts were a cover for one of Doctor Impossible's schemes. For a time she worked National Security Agency missions. She is a pastiche of Cyborg and Tomorrow Woman. The New Champions UK cover by Bryan Hitch. *Fatale, a superhero recruited by the New Champions and the narrator of the superhero-half of the novel. She is a cyborg, the result of experimental surgery following a near-fatal accident in São Paulo. She eventually discovers that the corporation responsible for creating and maintaining her cybernetic parts were a cover for one of Doctor Impossible's schemes. For a time she worked National Security Agency missions. *Damsel, a Wonder Woman-like character. She is the leader of both the original Champions and the New Champions. She is the daughter of a golden age superhero and a princess of an alien planet. She is also Blackwolf's ex-wife. Her powers are flight, super-strength, micro-vision, and a protective forcefield. *Blackwolf, co-founder of the Champions and Damsel's ex-husband. A Batman-like character, he is the team's only unpowered member, but he is athletically trained and intellectually gifted. He is motivated by the death of family members and has mild autism. He divides his time between managing his successful corporation and work as a superhero. *Feral, a half-human/half-tiger. He is the only member of the team who still patrols and fights street crime. *Elphin, the last fairy on Earth. Though born in the 10th century, she continues to have the appearance of a teenager but with insectoid wings. Inhumanly fast and strong, she uses a magical spear as a weapon and has some nature-controlling powers. *Mr. Mystic, a magician. He was a stage magician before travelling the world and discovering the secret of true magic. He wears a tuxedo and top hat as his costume. His powers are undefined but include illusion and teleportation. Real name is William Zard. *Rainbow Triumph, a teenage girl given experimental treatment for her terminal illness. The treatment saved her life and gave her superpowers, such as super-speed, but she needs to keep taking her medicine every few hours or she will die. *Lily, a reformed supervillainess and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible and CoreFire. She claims to come from the far future, having been sent back to prevent an ecological disaster that would destroy humanity. However, she later is revealed to be Erica Lowenstein, the Lois Lane-like one-time girlfriend of CoreFire. She is super-strong, invulnerable and transparent. Style and themes The story is divided into 21 chapters, with each chapter switching between the points-of-view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale. The narrative is written in the first person, like a memoir, describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists. The dual narrative foils and \\"blur[s] the distinction\\" between the superheroes and the supervillain. The language was described as having a \\"sincere tone of glory\\" and \\"boyish indulgence\\" with \\"an undercurrent of sadness and a surprisingly human universality\\". While the story uses standard comic book story elements, like superheroes fighting supervillains, the book is written entirely in prose. The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés, such as the use of many superlatives, with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters, like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh far more than a natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening. Common social situations and psychological issues, like loneliness and trying to connect with a group, are also portrayed. Reviewers identified numerous themes, such as power, greed, fame, ego, loneliness, belonging, and identity. Characterization of superheroes The novel uses characters with generic superhero traits. While they are public celebrities for being heroes, the novel deals more with the personal lives of superheroes, how they cope with their powers and interact with one another. The character Fatale, being asked to join the New Champions superhero group, is used as a \\"useful outsider looking in\\" behind the scenes. They exist in a \\"cult of overachievement\\", constantly competing and trying to distinguish themselves from one another, which results in characters as \\"colorful as playing cards but all from different decks, a jumble of incompatible suits and denominations dealt out for an 'Alice in Wonderland' game.\\" Despite their celebrity status and heroic facade, they exist in a \\"mundane reality\\" with a normal routine; as the villain devises new means of committing crimes and conquering the world, the heroes chat among themselves, reliving past adventures, and practice fighting one another. From the perspective of the supervillain Dr. Impossible, superheroes live in \\"a dumb, hackneyed world\\". Characterization of the supervillain Dr. Impossible is used as an archetype or stock character supervillain. He is characterized as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts to take control of the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with \\"Malign Hypercognition Disorder\\", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: \\"it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause.\\" From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, \\"they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up.\\" Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, \\"On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [insignificant] in the eyes of the world.\\" Genre Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines generally associated with the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as \\"real, human characters, with all of the foibles that come with the territory\\" in what one reviewer called a \\"hybridization of character and genre\\". Grossman described it as \\"a book about real people who happen to be or supervillains\\" and that if it were a comic, it would be \\"page after page of thought balloons\\". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times- Dispatch wrote \\"The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure.\\" Publication and reception Soon I Will Be Invincible was published by Pantheon Books, an imprint of the Knopf Doubleday division of Random House, and released on June 5, 2007, as a hardcover. In the UK it was published by the Penguin Group imprint Michael Joseph. An audiobook was released at the same time featuring the voices of J. Paul Boehmer and Coleen Marlo. Grossman promoted the book by attending book signings in major American cities. In the UK it was promoted by wrapping telephone booths in advertising, in reference to Superman changing outfits in such booths. The cover art, which features photos of stereotypical comic book character clothing like a mask and gloves, by Chip Kidd was called \\"excellent...[and] sure to attract readers\\". By contrast, Bryan Hitch's cover art on the British edition, which features hand-drawn illustrations of the book's characters, was called \\"counter-productive...[or] unnecessary\\" due to its graphical interpretations of characters that were deliberately written in prose only. The book was short-listed for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize. Work on a film adaption began in 2008 through Strike Entertainment with scripts being written Dan Weiss and Grossman. Several reviewers described book as clever, well written, engaging, amusing, and fun. The prose was described as \\"effortless\\", \\"colorful\\", \\"kinetic and often witty\\". Numerous reviewers thought the Dr. Impossible character was the highlight of the novel. The Library Journal review \\"highly recommended [the novel] for all public libraries\\" calling it \\"fun and thought-provoking book\\". In The New York Times Book Review reviewer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel \\"can't completely measure up [to other superhero fiction and film], but its ambition and persistence in the face of formidable odds make it an admirable addition to the genre\\". The Publishers Weekly review noted that the comic book scenario written in a prose novel, with \\"thoughtfully portrayed\\" characters, would broaden the appeal of the genre. Similarly, regarding the comic book set-up written in prose, Mat Johnson in USA Today wrote that Grossman's \\"fabulist vision is meticulously captured so that it might be gleefully explored, nostalgically, within its traditional boundaries\\". Journalist Carlo Wolff wrote that \\"it takes some time to engage because...Grossman is so enamored of the worlds he's fashioning that he overstuffs them...[but it] is a fresh, warm take on comic books, science fiction and pop culture.\\" The Kirkus Reviews summary notes that the action scenes are \\"unimpressive, interrupted by more talk as...the battle seesaws in an arbitrary fashion. For all the special effects, a debut novel that's lifeless and inert.\\" Both the reviewers for Entertainment Weekly and Christian Science Monitor gave the book a \\"B\\" grade, though The A.V.

Indent agents or indenting agents (or firms) are alternative terms for buying agents. An indent is an order for goods under specified conditions of sale. There are agents for all kinds of products, from raw material commodities through to specialized custom equipment. Real estate In the United States, agents who buy real estate in this way are also known as property search agents or buyers’ agents and are professionals exclusively acting on behalf of a property buyer who assists the client during the entire purchasing process from sourcing the properties that correspond to the clients' requirements to negotiating the best possible price and terms with the seller and helping the client during the legal process to complete the acquisition. Buying agents often preview properties on behalf of their clients, shortlist the most suitable, and usually accompany clients to all viewings. In order to ensure the most efficient property viewing experience, most agents offer a chauffeur and sometimes even helicopter viewings to their high-end clients. Often they will also offer personal concierge services which can schedule all viewings, book hotels, transfers and other amenities for the client. These services can be particularly useful to international clients who tend to fly in to view properties. In addition agents are typically able to connect the client with all necessary technical trades people who are required at different stages of the buying process such as lawyers, surveyors and other professionals. Buying agents might have access to off-market properties through their network of contacts, although this depends on the market conditions and on how well connected the agent is locally. The ethical behavior is a very important aspect to measure the professionalism of a buying agent: at any time they must advise their clients with no self-interest for their own success fee. While initially buying agents catered exclusively to wealthier demographics, lately, especially in more competitive markets like London or Paris, the entry-level has significantly dropped to properties valued at around £500,000 or €500,000 (see The Daily Telegraph,Christopher Middleton, \\"Property buying agents: Would you spend £15K just to find a home?\\", The Telegraph (London), February 26, 2010) At one end of the spectrum lie the super introduced local property experts who can be an invaluable resource for a buyer who is set on off-market or pre-market properties as well as private deals. These professionals are often able to source off-market because they have close ties with estate agents (or, in the United States, real estate brokers), they know other local intermediaries who may flag exclusive confidential deals, such as lawyers, private bankers, investment managers or other professionals and they sometimes know personally the owners of the best luxury properties for sale in the area they cover. If this is what the buyer is looking for then the size of the company is less relevant as contacts are made over time and lie in the hands of a few experienced professionals who may operate within larger organizations as well as on their own. Buying agents also often have close ties with property developers where the agent can get access to new properties before they come onto the open market. The better buying agents will also have extensive knowledge of the properties in your target area and will contact owners of suitable properties directly to enquire if they would sell. This does put you in a weaker position in the negotiations but it means that you will have access to properties that other buyers won't and if your buying agent is a skilled negotiator then you may not have to pay a premium. At the other end of the spectrum there are agencies that act more like relocation companies, well organized, operate in various languages, help their clients with all required paperwork, are well connected to various professionals and other companies in order to provide a full-blown service; these companies may be less capable of scouting off-market transactions or deal directly with private property owners. Independent buying agents like to stress their autonomy from selling agencies who, depending on the country, either act on behalf of sellers or as mediators between the two parties (See The Independent,Alessia Horwich and Julian Knight, \\"If sellers have agents, why can't buyers?\\", The Independent (London), February 21, 2010). On the other side some well known estate agencies also offer buying services despite reservations over conflict of interest. Because of the different nature of buying agencies, prospect buyers are often advised to contact more than one company to compare and contrast their benefits. As is often the case, it can be better to hire a professional who is more capable to listen and understand our needs even though his or her company does not entirely tick all the other boxes. Most buying agents have significant transactional experience; however, like estate agents, only few of these professionals have a surveying qualification so they may not be the best advisors when it comes to valuing the property and predicting future market trends. For this reason the buyer may rely on other advisors or their own judgment before taking an investment decision. From a geographical standpoint buying agents’ coverage ranges from a rather limited focus on few specific city districts or sub regional areas (a few towns and their surroundings) to nationwide 'chain' services. However each company has a few areas where it is stronger and only in those locations may it be able to deliver a superior value, especially when it comes to sourcing special opportunities. Only few companies in Europe have expanded to cover more than one country by employing different professionals. There are varying terms for a buying agent which include: property consultant, property acquisition consultant, relocation agent and property finder. As per the above paragraph their skill sets vary slightly but the business is very similar. As this specific section within the property industry is still relatively new, in comparison to estate agents for example, the specific terms used are still debated in each country. Legal requirements In some European countries, like the UK, buying agents do not need to pass any specific exam or get any certification to start practicing their profession while in other countries, like Italy, France or Spain they have to conform to the same qualification and legal requirements as selling agents do, even though the two roles differ substantially. This seeming gap in the regulation may be filled if and when the industry is going to mature. Fees Buying agents fees depend on the specific property market and often vary within a certain country. The overall fee structure is made of a small registration fee which is refundable (provided that the buyer completes the purchase within a certain time defined in the contract) and is charged upfront, and a success fee which is a percentage of the purchase price of the property and is paid at the exchange of contracts or when a preliminary contract is signed. Buying agents generally require exclusivity meaning that the client cannot continue to search on its own or via estate agents for the duration of the contract, which generally lasts from 3 to 6 months. French companies are forbidden from charging any registration fees and are required by law to tie all their compensation to the successful completion of the transaction. However good buying agents do not make any profit from the registration fee; the main purpose of the fee is to increase the likelihood that the client is sincerely committed to the purchase; in case they were not they would lose the registration fee after a certain length of time. The success fee is a percentage of the sale price. Prospect property buyers should know that there are two different arrangements mainly depending on market conditions: * In markets where the average selling time of a luxury property is high, buying agents tend to split the fee with the selling agent and therefore the service has no additional cost to the buyer. This happens because the selling agent typically prefers splitting his commission with the buying agent rather than waiting longer to find another buyer and sell the same property. In case the buying agent sources a private deal then they charge up to the selling agent commission (for instance the full 5% in the French Riviera \\"Transaction costs are moderate to high in France\\", Global Property Guide March 26, 2007) up to 2% in Spain. * In very liquid markets (like London or Paris) the buying agent fee is charged on top of the selling agent fee, so the buying agent service comes at an additional cost to the property buyer unless the buying agent is able to find a property that is not sold by an agent. In that case depending on the market buying agents charge an amount up to the selling agent commission (which is generally higher than the buying agent’s fee). * Some agents charge a success fee based on the purchase price - this is a fixed percentage. Alternatively other agents charge a fixed amount of money plus a percentage of the saving of the discount to the original asking price. All these conditions are well specified in the contract agreement that the client signs upfront. Buying agents often claim that they can get a higher discount on the sales price than a private buyer could manage because they better know the prices at which similar properties have been recently exchanged in the market and they make use of good negotiating skills. A full set of code of ethics is set out by The Property Ombudsman, which any respected buying agent would be a member of.

The game can be classified as both a serious game and a global warming game. In Keep Cool, up to six players representing the world's countries compete to balance their own economic interests and the world's climate in a game of negotiation. The goal of the game as stated by the authors is to \\"promote the general knowledge on climate change and the understanding of difficulties and obstacles, and \\"to make it available for a board game and still retain the major elements and processes.\\" Empirical studies have shown that Keep Cool can facilitate experiential learning about the difficulties of international climate politics. Reception After Keep Cool was released in stores, it was sold out in only four months, prompting a second edition of the game to be released. The game has become very popular in Germany, and the game's creators were surprised at the success. Petschel-Held explained, \\"With 'Keep Cool,' we've been able to open new channels for dialogue between scientists and the public,\\" and Eisenack commented, \\"Feedback has revealed surprising insights and exciting discussions about conflicts of interest in climate politics as highlights of Keep Cool.\\" Keep Cool has been used by NGO's, schools, universities, and gaming conventions, besides being used by families and the general public. The German Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMU) has now included Keep Cool as a part of its teaching materials. Aktivities related to KEEP COOL have been awarded various prizes: In 2016 the German Council for Sustainable Development awarded KEEP COOL mobil with the quality seal Werkstatt N. In 2017 Jasper Meya received the German Simulation and Gaming Award for his empirical study on the effectiveness of the board game KEEP COOL for teaching climate change. In 2016 and 2017 KEEP COOL mobil was awarded the Comenius-EduMedia-Siegel for educational media of particularly high didactic, content and design quality. Gameplay  Countries  The game can be played with three to six players. The countries that players will use for the game depends on the number of players, as shown in table below. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" !width=\\"70\\"Number of players style=text- align:centerCountries - style=\\"background-color: #99CCCC; text- align:center\\"3 style=\\"background-color: #99CCCC\\"USA & Partners, Europe, & Tiger Countries - style=\\"background-color: #FFCC33; text-align:center\\" 4style=\\"background-color: #FFCC33\\" Above + Developing Countries - style=\\"background-color: #99CC00; text-align:center\\" 5style=\\"background- color: #99CC00\\" Above + Former Soviet Union - style=\\"background-color: #CC9933; text-align:center\\" 6style=\\"background-color: #CC9933\\" Above + OPEC } Each of the countries has a distinct starting position in the game and some have special abilities/bargaining chips which can greatly affect negotiation. The United States begins the game with the most factories on the board (five black and one green) and always goes first. Europe begins with three black factories and one green, and the Tiger Countries begin with two black. The Former Soviet Union begins the game with one of each kind of factory, but has the special prerogative to demand one carbonchip from any player at the beginning of their turn. OPEC and the Developing Countries only start with one black factory each, but they both have special attributes which they can use to their advantage. OPEC receives an additional carbonchip as income for every four black factories on the game board. The Developing Countries can either add or remove up to three carbonchips to/from the carbometer from/to the chip pool.Eisenack, Klaus and Petschel-Held, Gerhard: \\"Keep Cool: Rules of Play.\\" 2004. Targets A player needs to fulfill both their economic target and their secret target to win the game. Once both of their targets are fulfilled, the game ends, whether or not the targets are met during that player's turn. It is possible that multiple players could achieve their targets at the same time. Economic Targets A player's economic target is met by having a certain minimum number of factories on the board. For this goal, only factories which are owned by that particular player count toward the total. This number is different for every group of countries, and it based on that group's number of starting factories and rate of growth. Players cannot receive factories from other players, but players may receive funds from other players which may go towards the cost of building new factories. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" Countriesstyle=\\"background-color: #99CCCC; text-align:center\\"USA & Partnersstyle=\\"background-color: #CC6699; text-align:center\\"Europestyle=\\"background-color: #00CC99; text- align:center\\"Tiger Countriesstyle=\\"background-color: #FFCC33; text- align:center\\" Developing Countriesstyle=\\"background-color: #99CC00; text- align:center\\" Former Soviet Unionstyle=\\"background-color: #CC9933; text- align:center\\" OPEC - style=text-align:centerTargetstyle=\\"background- color: #99CCCC\\"12 Factoriesstyle=\\"background-color: #CC6699; text- align:center\\"8 Factoriesstyle=\\"background-color: #00CC99; text- align:center\\"5 Factoriesstyle=\\"background-color: #FFCC33\\" 4 Factoriesstyle=\\"background-color: #99CC00\\" 5 Factoriesstyle=\\"background- color: #CC9933\\" 4 Factories } Secret Targets At the beginning of the game, players are randomly dealt a card with two secret targets printed on it. Players do not share these targets with other players. Players only have to meet one of the printed secret targets, though having two to choose from allows for some flexibility in their strategy. A player may switch between strategies at any time. There are eight different secret targets in Keep Cool. All targets are minimum or maximum numbers of protection tokens, green factories, or black factories. These minimum and maximum numbers can either be global targets or G77 targets. G77 targets only count the number of game pieces in the Former Soviet Union, Developing Countries, and Tiger Countries. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" Areacolspan=\\"2\\" ; align=\\"center\\"Maximum (global)colspan=\\"4\\" ; align=\\"center\\"Minimum (global)colspan=\\"2\\" ; align=\\"center\\"Minimum (G77 countries only) - Target Namestyle=\\"background-color: #000000; color: #FFFFFF\\"Environmentalistsstyle=\\"background-color: #339900; color: #FFFFFF\\"Climate Skepticsstyle=\\"background-color: #000000; color: #FFFFFF\\"Oil Industrystyle=\\"background-color: #339900; color: #FFFFFF\\"New Technologiesstyle=\\"background-color: #FF0000; color: #FFFFFF\\"Insurancesstyle=\\"background-color: #000000; color: #66CC33\\"Economic Growthstyle=\\"background-color: #339900; color: #FFFFFF\\"Tech.

Disasters The very first thing a player does on their turn, even before the usual steps of collecting income and the rest, is draw a greenhouse card. Greenhouse cards are the random generators of disasters in Keep Cool. Most greenhouse cards are disasters which affect a particular region (consequently only one player) such as Malaria Pandemic in China or Cold Winter in Europe. Greenhouse also include rarer events, such as global disasters (e.g. Sea-level rise) and beneficial events due to global warming, like more rain in Iran. The degree of the disaster or beneficial climate event is dependent on what level of warming has occurred in the game thus far, which is measured by the carbometer. In the blue zone, many disasters and other events have little or no effect. In the yellow and orange zones, disasters are particularly more potent as well as the benefit received from positive climate changes. In the red zone, climate events are catastrophic and beneficial events from positive change are severely reduced. Background  Countries  The different coalitions of countries used in Keep Cool are based on the groups of similar interests which have emerged through the conferences held by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Throughout the various conferences of the UNFCCC, the countries belonging to the group \\"USA & Partners\\" have been generally hesitant about signing on to mandatory emissions targets and commitments. The countries of the Former Soviet Union have had emissions below the oft-cited '1990 level' for many years now, so they play a special role in emissions reduction by keeping their emissions low. The countries of the European Union have tended to have stronger commitments to reductions. The remaining groups of countries all belong to the G77. The G77 countries are divided accordingly because of their different interests, i.e. countries like China and India want to rapidly expand their industry and use their own coal, and oil-exporting countries have made no commitments to reduce emissions.Eisenack, Klaus and Petschel-Held, Gerhard: \\"Keep Cool: The Scientific Background of the Game.\\" 2004. Developing countries are singled out as their own group partly because of their control of the world's rain forests. Depending on whether developing countries protect the rain forests in their lands and reforest or if they decide to clearcut in favor of expanding farmlands and industry, the developing countries can either act as another source of carbon pollution (via clearcutting) or as a carbon sink (via conservation and reforestation). Factories Green and black factories in Keep Cool do not correspond to any actual types of factories in reality. Instead, they are symbolic of energy generation. Green factories symbolize power generated from renewable sources like wind, sun, and biomass. Black factories represent power from non-renewable fossil fuel sources like oil and coal. In Keep Cool, the only way to truly reduce emissions is to demolish black factories. Protection Tokens Protection tokens are meant to represent general measures to adapt to the effects of global warming. Examples include installing flood plains, building reservoirs, and constructing new buildings in areas further away from the coast. In Keep Cool, the cost of protection tokens increases upon every purchase--\\"Dykes cannot be raised infinitely.\\" External links # Official Keep Cool website Sources Category:Board games introduced in 2004 Educational Games Category:Climate change and society ","title":"Keep Cool (board game)"},{"id":"12403319","text":"Ronnie Antonio Paris (December 9, 2001 – 2005) was an American three-year-old boy from Tampa, Florida, who was murdered in 2005. Paris was subject to severe physical abuse at the hands of his father, Ronnie Paris Sr., who was convinced he was homosexual despite his young age, and was forced to box repeatedly, eventually entering a coma and dying from brain injuries. His death brought attention to the Florida Department of Children & Families for failing to identify the child abuse and neglect. Controversy arose over Paris being removed from his home and placed in to foster care, only to be returned, and died within six weeks from continued abuse. Ronnie Paris Sr. was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 30-years in prison. Background In May 2002, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services removed Paris from his home and placed him in protective custody, after he was admitted to the hospital for repeated vomiting, and doctors determined he was undernourished and had a broken arm. On December 13, 2004, four days after his third birthday, Paris was returned to his parents. This replacement was the subject of investigation by the local press because they felt it represented a breakdown of the child welfare system. On January 22, Paris slipped into a coma after falling asleep on a couch at a family friend's house, where his parents were attending a Bible study. Upon realizing he was unconscious, his parents rushed into the hospital. Paris died six days later, when he was removed from life support.Man accused of killing 'gay' baby son, PlanetOut, July 14, 2005 Detective Anthony Zambito was suspicious and testified that \\"it wasn't until investigators questioned them separately\\" that the boy's mother spoke of abuse. During an investigation of the child's death, his mother—Nysheera Paris—told detectives that her husband—Ronnie Paris, Sr. -- had repeatedly abused the child, slapping him in the back of the head, slamming him into walls, and forcing the child to participate in father-son boxing matches until the boy began to shake, cry, and wet himself.\\"Mom testifies dad beat their 3-year-old son,\\" St. Petersburg Times, July 19, 2005 Trial The child's father was charged with murder and aggravated child abuse. His mother was charged with child neglect and failing to get medical attention for her son.\\"Parents charged in death of son,\\" St. Petersburg Times, February 2, 2005 In July 2005, Ronnie Paris Sr. went on trial for his son's murder facing a maximum of 15 years for the death. During the trial witnesses testified the boy had been slapped around and thrown into walls by his dad to toughen him up. Nysheera Paris testified that her husband thought their son might be gay, and that he would smack the boy in the back of the head and slam him into walls because he didn't want his son to grow up \\"soft.\\" Her testimony was corroborated by her sister, Shanita Powell, who said \\"He was trying to teach him how to fight,\\" and told the court \\"He was afraid the child might be gay.\\" Family friend Sheldon Bostick, who attended Bible study with the Paris family, testified that Ronnie Paris, Sr., \\"slap-boxed\\" with his son because \\"He didn't want him to be a sissy\\" Paris Sr. had reported this was how he had been taught, by his father, to take a punch. Forensic pathologist Dr. Sam Gulino noted the child's scarred face and bruised head, and told the court that the lethargy and vomiting spells, the coma and eventual death were due to head trauma that was not accidental but deliberately inflicted. The child's foster mother testified that during the two years he lived with her, Paris never vomited, and had a healthy appetite.\\"Toddler's autopsy detailed at trial,\\" St. Petersburg Times, July 14, 2005 Aftermath In July 2005, after three hours of deliberation, a jury convicted Ronnie Paris, Sr. of second degree manslaughter and aggravated child abuse in the death of his son. On August 19, 2005, he was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, and ten years probation. The mother Nysheera Paris was sentenced to 5 years probation for culpable negligence in the death of her son.\\"Woman gets five years in son's death,\\" St. Petersburg Times, January 10, 2006 The crime is also seen as a hate crime by LGBT supporters, including Tennessee artist James McKissic who premiered a large scale painting of Paris Jr. along with two other \\"youth of color who were victims of hate crimes\\" at the Chattanooga African American Museum in 2008. The Gay American Heroes Foundation, memorializing LGBT murder victims of \\"hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias,\\" will include Paris Jr. in their traveling memorial that visits cities where someone has been murdered for being LGBT or thought to be.

Description Oedipina alfaroi was described based on two specimens, adult females measuring in snout–vent length and in total length, respectively (the latter individual had injured tail, hence the lower total length). The head is pointed and the eyes are relatively small. Maxillary teeth are absent. Body is dark or purplish brown above and grayish below. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats are humid lowland forests at elevations of above sea level, but it can also occur in old banana plantations. It lives in the leaf litter.

The Amana Growth Fund was created in 1994. The Amana Developing World Fund was created in 2009. All three funds are managed according to Islamic principles. Traditional mutual funds are off-limits to Muslims, because they typically contain securities that are forbidden by sharia law. Accordingly, the Amana Funds are managed under strict guidelines to comply with Islamic principles. Examples of forbidden (haram) investments are companies that: :*Produce or sell alcohol, tobacco or pornography :*Process or sell pork products :*Generate revenue from gambling or interest (riba) :*Maintain a debt ratio of greater than one-third of assets The funds were created and are still managed under the value investment style. Nicholas Kaiser has been portfolio manager of the funds since 1990. Scott Klimo is the deputy portfolio manager of the funds. The Amana Funds are unique in that they were specifically conceived to meet the needs of Muslim investors. One of the reasons Muslims are motivated to save and invest is to make financial preparations necessary to make the Hajj, a sacred form of a self-presentation before God (Allah in Arabic) that is considered within Islam to be one of life's primary duties. In order to make the Hajj, a Muslim must first get his financial house in order, which presents special challenges if the money is to be invested in compliance Shari'ah-oriented financial principles. According to Amana's founding chairman Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza, :In order to make the Hajj, Muslims must first pay off their debts, including the zakat due on their wealth; to return whatever was given them in trust; and have enough savings to bear the expenses of the journey (such as travel, Hajj tax, and lodging) and the sacrifice (of an animal). Besides this, they also have to provide for their families and dependents during their absence. They must have earned and saved enough to cover these expenses. No Hajj is valid if it is performed \\"on credit.\\"M. Yaqub Mirza, Early Bird Financial Planning  Performance  Performance of the Amana Funds is best evaluated by consulting a variety of sources.

Smith was born in Byfield, Massachusetts. After graduating from Dartmouth, he moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, and became a pastor. In 1777, he returned to Dartmouth as a professor in of English, Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic. Smith arrived in Hanover in 1771 after graduating from Byefield Academy where he had studied under the classical scholar Samuel Moody. He was admitted to the junior class and graduated in 1773. He then studied divinity under Dartmouth President Eleazar Wheelock while serving as tutor in ancient languages for the freshman and sophomore classes. In 1776 he was granted the degree of Master of Arts. He was then appointed Dartmouth's first professor in November 1777. The agreement between Eleazar Wheelock and John Smith was written in November 1777 and amended by Dartmouth's Trustees in August 1778.\\"An Agreement between the Reverend Eleazar Wheelock, President of Dartmouth College and Mr. John Smith, later Tutor of the same with respect to said Mr. Smith¹s settlement + salary, in capacity of Professor of the languages in Dartmouth College\\" (\\"Copy from the Original\\" dated November 9, 1777 and August 27, 1778) Ravi D. Goel Collection on Yale (RU 1081). Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library From his early interest in Greek and Latin, he soon proceeded to master Hebrew, Chaldaic, Arabic and other oriental languages. In 1780 he also prepared an interesting set of lectures on Natural Philosophy covering Newtonian astronomy and earth science, in which he speculated on the possibility of multiple peopled worlds and the origin of the Indians. These lectures seem to have stimulated his students Solomon Spaulding and Ethan Smith to further speculate on the later subject. In 1779 Smith also was appointed college librarian. After the death of Professor of Divinity Sylvanus Ripley in 1787, he absorbed Ripley's duties. In 1788 Smith was also appointed to the Board of Trustees. He also was pastor of the College Church and led the daily chapel sessions. In the late 1790s and early 19th century he prepared a remarkable set of theological lectures that covered various aspects of the details of his Armininan (free will), non Calvinist thinking. All of his published grammars and unpublished lectures and grammars can be found in the Rauner Special collections library at Dartmouth. His theological work was so appreciated by the Freewill Baptists at Brown that he was granted a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1803. He was in the final stages of preparing his theology lectures for publication in 1809 when he died. His work generally anticipated the efforts of Joseph Smith's development of Mormon doctrine. Smith died from tuberculosis in 1809. References * Goldman, Yosef.

It is found on the Caribbean slopes of northwestern Panama, eastern Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and northern Honduras. The specific name cyclocauda refers to the circular caudal grooves. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length; the tail is approximately twice as long as the body (range 1.9–2.2). The snout is somewhat pointed. The eyes are small. The body and the tail are mostly cylindrical; much of the tail is only slightly narrower than the body. There are 19 costal grooves and about 56 to 70 caudal grooves. There are four fingers and five toes that are fused together; no more than one third of any digit is free. Skin is smooth. Dorsal and lateral coloration is grayish slate, turning slightly brownish in the distal half of the tail. Habitat and conservation Oedipina cyclocauda occurs in humid lowland forests at elevations generally below ; Honduran records from elevations up to might refer to another species. It is terrestrial and semi-fossorial. The type series was collected from rotting logs in which they appeared to follow tunnels made by beetle larvae (a microhabitat shared with Oedipina gracilis) and from piles of rotting weeds or stumps. Development is direct, without free-living larval stage. Oedipina cyclocauda is widely spread but uncommon, except in Honduras where it is fairly common. It is threatened by the loss of trees caused by expansion of agriculture and human settlements, as well as logging; loss of trees causes drying of the soil. It is presumably present in some protected areas.

He is one of the founding members of heavy metal band Aria.(15 November 2010). «Ария» готовится отметить 25-летие, Shoowbiz.ru (in Russian) (article about 25th anniversary of band)  Biography  Vladimir was born May 12, 1958, in Lyubertsy, Russian SFSR. He graduated from Moscow Power Engineering Institute, where he met Vitaly Dubinin. The two institute mates became friends and formed a band Volshebnie Sumerki (Magic Twilight). The band played mostly cover versions of foreign bands' songs, such as Deep Purple and Rainbow. Arthur Berkut was the band's vocalist, and Magic Twilight is often considered to be a prototype to Aria. After Twilight's disband, Holstinin, together with bassist Alik Granovsky, joined rock band Alpha. Their participation was short-lived, and in 1984 they went to VIA Poyushchie Serdtsa (Singing Hearts) led by producer Victor Vekshtein. Joined by vocalist Valery Kipelov, they formed a heavy metal band Aria, officially registered as a \\"side project\\" to Singing Hearts. Aria soon developed to be much more popular than original Singing Hearts that played a common kind of Soviet pop-rock music. After the breakup of original lineup, Holstinin and Kipelov kept the side of Vekshtein, who owned the band's name. Vladimir invited his friend and former bandmate Vitaly Dubinin to replace Granovsky on bass. Currently, Holstinin remains the only founding member in actual lineup of Aria. Along with Dubinin, he is one of main composers of the band. Recently he produced some young metal bands; his most notable collaboration was the best-selling Elven Manuscript concept album by Epidemia.

The head is small and narrow, and the body is slender, with tail longer than SVL. The clutch size is about six eggs. They have direct development: eggs hatch into juveniles that measure about in total length, still retaining their gills.

History The original Apaches were one of the six charter franchises of the Class D Rio Grande Valley League in 1949. That first season, Laredo finished 80-60 in second place, and were eliminated by Brownsville in the playoffs. The following year, the Apaches moved into a new stadium, West Martin Field (now Veterans Field) and finished second again, edged out for the pennant by a single game by Harlingen; again, the Apaches were beaten in the semifinals, this time by Corpus Christi Seahawks. Losing two of their eight clubs mid- season, the RGVL folded after the 1950 campaign, and four of the loop's teams moved to the Class B Gulf Coast League (not to be confused with the current circuit of that name). In 1951, Laredo finished fourth but were eliminated by Corpus Christi Seahawks in the post-season; in 1952, the Apaches slipped to fifth and missed the playoffs. In their final campaign in 1953, led by batting champ Juan Senties (.379), Laredo edged back up to fourth, but were again dumped in the playoffs, this time by Galveston. Both the Apaches and the GCL would fold at the end of the season. Owls and the new Apaches Professional baseball would not return to Laredo until 1985, when the Mexican League club Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo became the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos, playing home games on both sides of the Rio Grande. In 1995, however, the Owls suddenly had competition, as the San Antonio Tejanos of the independent Texas–Louisiana League transferred to Laredo. But the new Apaches wouldn't last long; sporting the league's worst record at 17-32, and drawing only about 700 fans per game at the now-aged Veterans Field, the league decided to fold the franchise (as well as the Pueblo Bighorns) mid-season. The Tecolotes would continue to play in Laredo until 2004; in 2011, the city council voted to build a new ballpark, Uni-Trade Stadium, and the American Association granted an expansion team, the Laredo Lemurs, in time for the 2012 season. The Lemurs withdrew from the AA before the 2017 season, but the Mexican League announced that the Rojos del Águila de Veracruz club would become a new version of the Owls, and would play some of their home games at Uni-Trade Stadium, starting in 2018.

It was originally known as the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. History In 1996, Dale Gagner and his associate Jonnie Stewart, former American Wrestling Association (AWA) employees, filed corporate papers to license the AWA name in the state of Minnesota and formed an organization known as AWA Superstars of Wrestling. In April 2007 World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) filed a lawsuit against Dale Gagner and Jonnie Stewart, citing trademark infringement, as WWE owned all American Wrestling Association properties due to their purchase after the AWA's closure. In October 2008, the court ruled that although Gagner and Stewart had licensed the AWA in the state of Minnesota, they had never filed for a federal trademark and ruled in favor of WWE. The court ruling prohibits Gagner and his associate from exploiting or trading on the AWA name or any other derivatives. As a result, the organization was renamed to Wrestling Superstars Live.

Bradbury and starring John Wayne and Gabby Hayes. Plot The character, John Martin, is polite and genial. On a ride to the small town of Rainbow Valley, he runs into George, an \\"old-timer\\", who is looking for water for his car. Martin is surprised to see a car; he gives the old-timer his entire canteen of water. George, the mailman for the area, starts his car and heads down the road. Farther down, the road is being watched by highwaymen who have set up an ambush. Martin is riding on the same road and sees the highwaymen chasing George. Martin follows and takes on the highwaymen, but not before the last one shoots George. Martin leaps from his horse to the car. George is not killed; the bullet only grazed his skull. Martin hitches his horse to the back of the car and rides into town with George. Martin takes George to the town doctor. Meanwhile, the townspeople are rallying against the gang of highwaymen. The people of Paradise Valley are trying to build a road and modernize the town. They want to bring in \\"law and order\\" to the area, because they are tired of being abused and terrorized by the gang. They are putting together a petition to the governor of the state for legal and physical protection against the gang. Martin walks into the Post Office and claims he beat back the highwaymen. When Martin sees a suspicious character and asks him some questions, the man starts fighting with Martin. Some of the town's elders watching the fight. Martin accuses the suspicious character of being one of the highwaymen. The elders say about Martin, \\"Say, that fellow's a fighter! We need him around here!\\" The postmistress, Eleanor, thinks Martin is not a good guy, although it is obvious from his clothing and bearing that he is. George champions Martin's character on account of his valiant struggle with the highwaymen. Meanwhile, the gang is sitting in the saloon, talking about how they messed up the ambush. They need to stop the road and keep the law out of the valley; they're headed up by Rogers, a prominent man in town who got Eleanor her job. Martin figures out exactly what the gang is wanting to do—they want to send the prospectors out of business and then buy the prospectors' land at a low price. The owner of the general store owner, Powell, thinks Martin is \\"the one man who won't be intimidated by this gang\\", and he touts himself as an excellent judge of character and reckons that Martin measures up to his standards. Martin went to school for engineering, so he's smart and capable of rebuilding the road. He's a strategist who knows how the gang will work. He is magnetic and gets the people behind him. Meanwhile, the gang is strategizing on how to attack the road workers; the road workers pick up their weapons and start defending themselves against the gang. A shoot-out occurs; George uses dynamite to fend off the attackers. Martin returns to the Post Office, where Eleanor is friendly to Martin; she's had a change of heart because of his friendliness, bravery, and hard work on the road. He is gentle and flirtatious but humble and virtuous. The highway gang is in the dark saloon, playing poker, smoking, and drinking. The gang plans to hide out along the road to kidnap George. They don't hesitate to use physical violence, and they knock out a bystander and leave him along the road. The bystander revives and quickly rides to the road workers, where he tells Martin what happened. Martin immediately leaves and rides alone to save George. He skillfully tracks the gang to an old cabin, where he quickly sneaks into the barn and finds George tied up. George insists that they have to get the car out because it has mail in it; Martin disagrees but decides to help George. Mr. Rogers walks in the Post Office and leaves his wallet on the desk. The postmistress walks out with him, but he gets her to give him the key and runs back to the Post Office to steal the petition about the road. The gang substitutes a petition to release another gang member from his sentence for his crimes. They also revel in the fact that they stole all the remaining dynamite. Two weeks later, Martin and George wonder why they have not heard any response to the petition. In the gang hideout, Mr. Rogers walks in with the pardoned gang member (the boss, Butch), and the gang explains the situation to him. It happens that Martin and Butch were cellmates in jail. Butch wants to see Martin, so Mr. Rogers goes to find him. In the Post Office, Mr. Rogers tells the postmistress that Martin is an ex-convict. Martin rides into town; Rogers calls him over; the owner of the general store, Powell, sees the conversation. Martin seems happy to hear that Butch is in town. George sees Martin going into the saloon with Rogers; George goes into the Post Office, Powell follows, they assume Martin is fraternizing with Rogers and Butch. George has faith in Martin, but Powell and Eleanor assume the worst about him. Meanwhile, Martin is talking to Butch about the road; Martin appears to be on the same side as Butch, and he agrees to destroy the road in return for a cut of the profits when the prospectors sell out. The townspeople gather and talk about how Martin has betrayed them. Powell issues a call to arms to kill the entire gang. George and Eleanor find a letter to George from the governor. Martin is actually an undercover agent who is trying to bust out the gang, and the letter specifies that the townspeople should cooperate and comply with Martin's \\"suspicious\\" activities without blowing his cover. George and Eleanor realize they have to stop the mob that has just left town to stop Martin and Butch. George hitches up a couple of horses to the car to pull it like a carriage. Meanwhile, the mob of townspeople is getting closer and closer to the gang and Martin. Suddenly, Martin punches out Rogers, and a shoot-out begins between the townspeople and the gang. Butch is hooking up the dynamite, but Martin stops him and they begin fighting. The gang starts retreating, but Butch sets off the dynamite right on top of the gang, killing all of his men. Martin arrests Butch and shows that he was using the gang to get through the road because they had stolen all of the dynamite. George drives the car up to the hill and remarks on the road's success. Finally, the road is built, runs through the hill, and is all set up for the town. In the back seat of the car, Martin and Eleanor are kissing.

Taxonomy The genus Macrodontia Lepeletier, Audinet-Serville & Lacordaire, 1830 is in some documents credited to Latreille as the authority,Barsevskis A. et al (eds), Cerambycidae of the World, 2016 but this appears to be an error, possibly due to confusion arising from Latreille having been the authority for the subfamily Prioninae and the family Cerambycidae. It is a genus within the family Cerambycidae, subfamily Prioninae, tribe Macrodontiini. The genus includes the following species: *Macrodontia batesi Lameere, 1912 *Macrodontia castroi Marazzi, Pavesi & Marazzi, 2008 *Macrodontia cervicornis (Linné, 1758) *Macrodontia crenata (Olivier, 1795) *Macrodontia dejeanii Gory, 1839 *Macrodontia flavipennis Chevrolat, 1833 *Macrodontia itayensis Simoëns, 2006 *Macrodontia jolyi Bleuzen, 1994 *Macrodontia marechali Bleuzen, 1990 *Macrodontia mathani Pouillaude, 1915 *Macrodontia zischkai Tippmann, 1960 *Macrodontia antonkozlovi Santos-Silva, 2016 Description The species are large. Some are giants among insects, with occasional specimens more than 17 cm long. The habitus is fairly typical of the Cerambycidae, except for the enormous jaws of the males: elongated, more or less parallel-sided beetles with dorsiventrally flattened bodies, generally all brown or orange with longitudinal dark striping. The males are larger than the females and generally have enormous jaws, from which the generic name derives: Macrodontia is from the Greek μάκρος (makros) meaning \\"long or large\\" and ὀδόντος, (odontos) meaning \\"of a tooth\\". In contrast, in proportion to the beetles' size, the antennae are shorter than those of typical Cerambycidae. Distribution The genus was originally described from South America, but the 11 currently recognised species variously range from regions between Guatemala at the north of Central America, or even Southern Mexico, to Argentina in South America.

It is found on the Pacific versant in south-eastern Guatemala, to central to north-eastern El Salvador and adjacent southern Honduras. Honduran populations might represent another species. Etymology The specific name taylori honors Edward Harrison Taylor (1889–1978), an American herpetologist. Description Oedipina taylori was described by in 1952 based on a single specimen. This specimen—the holotype—is an adult male that measured in snout–vent length (SVL). Its tail is incomplete but is presumed to have been several times the SVL. The limbs are short, with partially webbed hands and feet. The coloration is gun-metal blue. It resembles Oedipina alfaroi but it has less webbing in the digits and a reduced number of vomerine teeth. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats probably are lowland and mid-altitude forests, but it has also been found in many man-made habitats, e.g., in the rubble of a collapsed shack and on a patio in a small town. The holotype was found underneath a rotting log in an open forest. It has been recorded at elevations of above sea level. It appears to tolerate some degree of habitat change and loss.

One defines the width of the surface in a given direction to be the perpendicular distance between the parallels perpendicular to that direction. Thus, a surface of constant width is the three-dimensional analogue of a curve of constant width, a two-dimensional shape with a constant distance between pairs of parallel tangent lines. Definition More generally, any compact convex body D has one pair of parallel supporting planes in a given direction. A supporting plane is a plane that intersects the boundary of D but not the interior of D. One defines the width of the body as before. If the width of D is the same in all directions, then one says that the body is of constant width and calls its boundary a surface of constant width, and the body itself is referred to as a spheroform. Examples A sphere, a surface of constant radius and thus diameter, is a surface of constant width. Contrary to common belief the Reuleaux tetrahedron is not a surface of constant width. However, there are two different ways of smoothing subsets of the edges of the Reuleaux tetrahedron to form Meissner tetrahedra, surfaces of constant width. These shapes were conjectured by to have the minimum volume among all shapes with the same constant width, but this conjecture remains unsolved. Among all surfaces of revolution with the same constant width, the one with minimum volume is the shape swept out by a Reuleaux triangle rotating about one of its axes of symmetry ; conversely, the one with maximum volume is the sphere. Properties Every parallel projection of a surface of constant width is a curve of constant width. By Barbier's theorem, it follows that every surface of constant width is also a surface of constant girth, where the girth of a shape is the perimeter of one of its parallel projections. Conversely, Hermann Minkowski proved that every surface of constant girth is also a surface of constant width . References * . * . * *. * . External links * Spheroforms * T. Lachand-Robert & É.

It is currently considered as monotypic, although this may yet change as molecular data suggest that it is embedded within a paraphyletic Pseudoeurycea. Parvimolge townsendi is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in central and southern Veracruz, Mexico. It is represented by the species Parvimolge townsendi, commonly known as Townsend's dwarf salamander.  Habitat and conservation  Natural habitats of Parvimolge townsendi are cloud and oak forests. They are usually found living in bromeliads or on the ground. They are somewhat adaptable and can survive in shaded coffee plantations as long as humidity levels are maintained. Parvimolge townsendi has never been common, but it has undergone significant population declines. It has only been observed once since 1997, despite efforts to locate it. It is threatened by habitat loss, but more information on the reasons for the decline of this species is needed. Parvimolge townsendi was once considered abundant, however Batrachochytrium dendrobatis, Chytrid fungus, infected this species' geographic range about 40 years ago, devastating many amphibian populations, including Townsend's dwarf salamander (Sandoval-Comte, 2012)Sandoval-Comte, A., Pineda, E., Aguilar-López, J.L. 2012.

Rajasekara Murthy (10 May 1922 – 5 December 2010) was an Indian politician, who was a member 8th Lok Sabha the lower house of the Indian Parliament from the Lok Sabha constituency of Mysore in Karnataka. Early life Murthy was born in Malangi village on the banks of Cauvery in Mysore district. Political career Murthy had held several senior cabinet minister positions in Karnataka Government including the important portfolios of Excise, Industry, Finance and Revenue. He was also a union minister under the then former prime minister Sri PV Narasimha Rao's cabinet. A close follower of former Congress President S. Nijalingappa and a close associate of former Chief Minister Veerendra Patil, Murthy had served in their Ministries and also with M. Veerappa Moily, before he moved to Rajya Sabha. He was regarded as one of the most powerful Lingayat leaders, a powerful community dominating the political scenario of the State. He was a member of Lok Sabha once and represented Rajya Sabha thrice with Congress, BJP and JD(S) party tickets during the last three terms. He was a Minister of State (independent charge) holding the Ministries of Surface Transport and Ports in the P.V. Narasimha Rao Ministry. Known for his discipline and administrative acumen, Murthy revived the financial position of Karnataka when he took over as Finance Minister when Veerendra Patil became the Chief Minister for the second time in 1989. It was during Veerappa Moily's regime as CM that Murthy as Revenue Minister unearthed landscam in Mysore taluk, which led to suspension and sacking of government officials for colliding with land grabbers, creating fictitious documents. He was the cousin brother of former Union Minister M.S. Gurupadaswamy. Entering the first Assembly in 1952 from T.Narasipura constituency, was elected to Assembly again for five times. A close aide of the then Chief Minister S. Nijalingappa, Murthy became the Minister for Commerce and Industry. Opposition Leader Siddharamaiah was once a contender for Chamundeswari seat represented by Murthy. It was in 1989 that Murthy of Congress defeated Siddharamaiah of JD(S) by 6892 votes. Murthy got 42,892 votes, while Siddu 36,000 votes. Murthy has been the Member of Parliament- Rajya Sabha many times. He won one of the a Rajya Sabha seat by defeating the business tycoon Vijaya Mallya. Malaya was very confident about his win due to his wealth but did not consider the factor that People and their representatives trusted Mr Murthy and his principles and taught Dr Vijaya Mallya that his money power and lobby was as good as his Kingfisher Airlines against the loyalty and trust Mr Murthy commanded. He was a known party hopper. Initially he was with Congress, later joined BJP followed by JD(S). This is because he was very strict, honest and disciplined which irritated the High Command of their respective parties who are well branded for corruption and Bribery, things goes against the moral principles of Mr Murthy. Hence he was always troubled and had to shift parties. It was not his desire jump, but the great leaders who are the brand ambassadors of corruption brought this circumstance. He had to become the CM of Karnataka back in the early 1990s but was denied the change due to the moral administration of his superiors and peers. Mr Murthy was a true follower of the Great Mahatma Gandhi and his values unlike his superiors who also are the followers of our Great Mahatma Gandhi, but on the printed paper (Rupee Notes Followers of Gandhi). Death Murthy died at 11.30 pm on 5 December 2010 at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi. His body was brought to Bangalore on 6 December 2010 and the state funeral was held at Chamrajanagar on 7 December 2010.

It was endemic to the United States and only known from its type series collected in Jasper County, Mississippi in 1964. Later research has cast doubt to its validity; it might be a junior synonym of Plethodon mississippi. Description Ainsworth's salamander is a very attenuated Plethodon with short limbs. It has 16 costal grooves, counting a Y-shaped groove in the groin as two grooves, and four to six costal folds between adpressed limbs. Its peritoneum is not distinctively pigmented. It has 40 premaxillary/maxillary teeth, and palatine teeth in a large median patch, 12 teeth wide and 18 teeth long. Vomerine teeth are in two well-separated, arc-shaped rows, with eight to 10 teeth each. As with all Plethodon species, this one has four digits on the manus and five on the pes, a cylindrical tail without any basal constriction, and a tongue attached in the front. [citing Lazell (1998)] In preservative, the specimens are dark blackish-brown without any noticeable pattern, and the peritoneum lacks any distinctive pigmentation. The holotype and paratype were collected by Jackson Harold Ainsworth as Plethodon glutinosus in 1964, and described as a new species, Plethodon ainsworthi, by James Lazell in 1998. No other specimens are known, and the precise collection locality is unknown. The holotype is damaged, the paratype was damaged so strong that it is now lost. The distinctive features of this species, however, may result from long-term, improper preservation, suggesting that it is not a valid taxon. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats were temperate forests and freshwater springs. Reasons for its extinction are unknown, but likely involved habitat loss. Plethodon mississippi, however, exists in the area where P. ainsworthi is believed to have been collected.

It was adopted by hikers after the sport of freeskiing gained popularity in the 1990s. Off-trail hiking For off-trail hiking, the freehiker relies on tools such as topographical maps, a compass and a GPS unit. It emphasizes a hike experience free of constraints, as opposed to seeking a shortcut to a specific destination such as a scenic viewpoints or summits. There is some concern that freehikers cause trailbraiding (creating multiple paths which can damage vegation), erosion, new trail creation, and other negative environmental impacts.

Described in 2005, it is one of the most recently described species in the large genus Plethodon. Description P. asupak is a moderate-sized, robust salamander with long limbs growing to a snout-to-vent length of for males and for females. It has a broad brown or bronze dorsal stripe and is otherwise purplish-gray with white flecks that condense on the sides and limbs into larger patches. The underparts are dark gray or purplish mottled with paler gray and flecked with white. It frequently has gold spotting on its otherwise black irises. Juveniles have paired, reddish dorsal stripes. Distribution and habitat A species endemic to California, it inhabits shaded, moss-covered talus slopes in old-growth mixed evergreen and montane fir forests of the Klamath Mountain Range. It was discovered in 2001, and is currently known from a few locations near the confluence of the Klamath and Scott Rivers, hence its common name Scott Bar salamander. Its range is only 20 km (13 mi) at its greatest dimension. Known elevations extend from above sea level.

Plot summary Touch Me tells the story of a young Australian named Xavier McLachlan, who is in his final year of high school. A keen sportsman, his aim for the year is to be selected in the school Rugby team and help his friends and teammates win the first premiership in twenty years. All is going according to plan until he meets Nuala Magee, an unusual girl with her own agenda; she cross-dresses, and acts in a deliberately confrontational manner towards boys. Xavier is intrigued by her and against the advice of his friends, becomes very close to her, eventually starting a relationship with her. Xavier also befriends a new boy, Alex Murray and this friendship helps Xavier begin to change his ideas about what it means to be a man. The tension between Xavier and his friends begins to isolate him and when he betrays Nuala out of weakness, and a tragedy befalls Alex Murray, he is faced with difficult decisions about who he is and what he holds most dear. Characters Xavier McLachlan - The main character of the story is a teenage footballer who always strives to win in every game. He attends St. Matthews College, an all-boys school in a large Australian city.

The B-25 featured a smaller body than the B-45 and after 1965 they had a narrow neck (1 5/8\\" nut) while the earliest models had the standard 11/16\\" nut. Many came with a plastic bridge and ceramic adjustable saddle. Some B-25's had a cherry sunburst finish, but there were a limited number of ebony finish editions with white pickguards. There was also a natural finish B-25-N edition. Production of these standard B-25's ended in 1977. Gibson produced a \\"short scale\\" version of the B-25, the B-25 ¾, with the same features as the standard B-25 but with a ¾ size body and a different sunburst finish. Gibson manufactured this edition from 1962 through 1968. From 1966 - 1968, the natural finish B-25-N ¾ was also available. The short scale editions were marketed as \\"student\\" guitars. Two 12-string editions of the B-25 were also available starting in 1962. The B-25-12 had a cherry sunburst finish and was available through 1970. Gibson manufactured the natural finish B-25-12-N through 1977, the last year of production for all B series guitars. In 2012, Gibson Custom Shop launched the \\"Icon '60s\\" series, reissued many classic models. Although never appeared on Gibson's official website or media presses, there is a batch of B-25 and B-24 3/4 also produced, especially for the Japan market.  B-15  In 1967, the B-15 became the last model of the B series Gibson introduced. It featured a mahogany body, [spruce] top, rosewood fingerboard, and natural finish. Gibson also referred to the B-15 as a \\"student model\\" and manufactured it through 1970.

Its natural habitat is temperate forests and it is threatened by habitat loss. Description The Fourche Mountain salamander has a sturdier body shape than most of the other salamander species in the locality. Its back is black with two rows of irregular grey blotches and a speckling of smaller pale spots. The underside is dark with a few lighter spots and the chin is pale. Distribution and habitat The Fourche Mountain salamander only occurs in the Fourche Mountains, the Shut-In Mountains, and the eastern side of Iron Fork Mountain in the Ouachita Mountain range in Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. It is found in deciduous woodland high in the mountains especially in ravines and on north-facing slopes. It sometimes hybridizes with the Rich Mountain salamander (P. ouachitae) where their ranges overlap on the western side of Fourche Mountain. Biology The Fourche Mountain salamander hides in undergrowth and under rocks and logs. It mainly feeds at night on small invertebrates such as insects, spiders, and worms. Between May and September when the weather is hot and dry, it may aestivate underground, emerging to forage during any wet periods that may occur. It probably hibernates between November and March. Little is known of its breeding habits, but they are likely to be similar to the Rich Mountain salamander. The eggs are laid in underground chambers and brooded by the female, no aqueous larval stage exists and direct development takes place into juvenile salamanders. Females may breed in the fall or winter in alternate years. Status The Fourche Mountain salamander is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Within its range, it is often locally abundant, but its restricted distribution make it susceptible to disturbance and habitat degradation. Some protection is provided because its entire range occurs within the Ouachita National Forest.

This species can be found in the Appalachians from the Susquehanna River Valley in Pennsylvania, south to the New River in northwestern Virginia, eastern West Virginia, and western Maryland. Ecology The species occurs in terrestrial valley and ridge physiography, generally in mature hardwood forests with well-drained soils. It lays eggs in moist cavities, where they develop directly without a larval stage. Individuals can be found under logs and rocks and tolerate cool weather well. In wet weather, they forage in leaf litter and as the surface dries, retreat to damp covered areas. They tend to be found on slightly drier slopes than their close relative, the red-backed salamander.

It was co-founded in 2001 by Debra Haffner, a Unitarian Universalist minister and sexologist, and Larry Greenfield, an American Baptist minister and theologian. The Religious Institute’s stated purpose is \\"to change the way America understands the relationship of sexuality and religion\\". Among its objectives are building a network of clergy and other religious leaders who are dedicated to sexual justice, promoting sexuality education in faith communities, and educating policymakers and the general public about a progressive religious view of sexuality. Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing In May 1999, twenty theologians from various traditions came together to formulate the \\"Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing\\". It offers a progressive religious framework for sexuality. As of 2006, it had been endorsed by over 2,250 religious leaders from over 35 religious traditions. A new start At its inception, the Religious Institute was a program of Christian Community, Inc. That organization became defunct in February 2012. In March 2012,http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/90-0802328/religious- institute.aspx the Religious Institute incorporated as an independent organization, Religious Institute, Inc, and received IRS recognition as a non- profit educational organization shortly thereafter. Issues The Religious Institute addresses a variety of sexual and reproductive justice concerns through advocacy, education, and development of resources as well as through partnerships with clergy and congregations, national religious organizations, and sexual and reproductive health organization. Sexually healthy faith communities The Religious Institute believes that all religious communities are responsible for addressing sexuality. It defines a sexually healthy faith community as one that is “committed to fostering spiritual, sexual, and emotional health among the congregation and providing a safe environment where sexuality issues are addressed with respect, mutuality, and openness.” Sexuality is integrated with spirituality in liturgies, pastoral care, religious education with both youth and adults, and in community social action programs. Sexuality education The Religious Institute believes that religious communities have a unique role in providing sexuality education. Its publication A Time to Speak: Faith Communities and Sexuality Education provides ideas and resources for faith communities on how to provide sexuality education for their congregants as well as support sexuality education in their communities. Seminary education The Religious Institute has engaged seminaries in the United States to institute new courses and institutional changes on sexuality issues, through sexuality education for seminarians, including a classroom graduate course; an online, graduate-level course; faculty and student training workshops; and ongoing research on seminary practices. This work builds on a 2009 study by the Religious Institute, Sex and the Seminary: Preparing Ministers for Sexual Justice and Healthhttp://religiousinstitute.org/research-report/sex-and-the-seminary- preparing-ministers-for-sexual-health-and-justice that surveyed 36 seminaries and rabbinical schools of varying size and geographic location, representing a range of Christian, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist traditions, which found sexuality courses largely absent from most seminary curricula and degree requirements. This study also outlines the criteria by which a seminary, rabbinical or divinity school could be considered as sexually healthy and responsible. In January 2012, the Religious Institute began classifying seminaries, rabbinical and divinity school meeting a majority of the criteria as Sexually Healthy and Responsible Seminaries. At that time, twenty institutions met this criteria, compared to ten at the time of the 2009 study. Adolescent sexuality The Religious Institute feels that faith communities serve more youth than any other agency other than schools and therefore has the opportunity and obligation to have honest discussions with adolescents about sexuality. The Institute encourages faith communities to speak openly with teens about their sexuality, provide accurate information, and affirm sexuality as a blessing. Reproductive justice The Religious Institute affirms the moral agency of women and asks faith communities to support reproductive rights. It holds that abortion should be safe, legal, accessible, and rare. It supports \\"responsible procreation\\", accessible and affordable contraception, prenatal care, and \\"intentional parenting\\". Marriage equality The Religious Institute believes that marriage equality concerns not only issues of gaining access to legal protections for same-sex couples, but it is also a matter of justice. It calls upon religious communities to affirm sexual diversity and all loving, mutual relationships as sacred. Sexual and gender diversity The Religious Institute challenges religious leaders to speak publicly about issues of sexual diversity and to advocate, both in secular and faith-based contexts, for the justice and the full inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, including the ordination of LGBT clergy. On the completion of the Institute's \\"Open Letter to Religious Leaders on Sexual and Gender Diversity\\", Haffner commented, “Sexual and gender oppression can no longer be portrayed as virtuous and morally defensible. While religious denominations continue to debate issues of sexuality, the silence and condemnation of clergy have led to destroyed relationships, suicidal despair and discrimination and violence against LGBT persons. Denying that God created diversity as a blessing is denying Biblical teaching.\\" Sexual abuse prevention The Religious Institute recognizes the responsibility of each faith community to ensure that it is sexually healthy and free of abuse and harassment. It works with congregations on issues of child sexual abuse and healthy childhood sexuality, sexual offenses and offenders, and how to develop democratic processes for times when action is required. HIV/AIDS The Religious Institute believes that all faith communities are \\"called by God to affirm a life of hope and healing in the midst of HIV/AIDS.\\" In its publication The Age of AIDS: A Guide for Faith-Based Communities the Religious Institute in conjunction with PBS, Frontline, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting(CPB) provides resources for faith communities in responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Services Technical assistance The Religious Institute staff work with clergy, congregations, and denominational bodies on a one-time, short-term, or long- term basis to address sexuality issues. Staff can help choose or plan curricula, develop safe congregation policies, identify local consultants or referral sources, and respond to difficult situations and circumstances around a sexuality issue. Training workshops and speaking engagements The Religious Institute provides keynote speakers and workshop leaders for congregations as well as regional and national meetings on sexuality, spirituality, and religion; sexuality education for youth, parents, and adults; building sexually healthy faith communities; and other sexuality and religion topics. Media Religious Institute staff assist the media in identifying spokespeople from various denominations to speak on sexual justice issues. Clearinghouse The Religious Institute's clearinghouse includes information on sexuality and religion, including practices, resources, trends, and current controversies.

Plethodon hubrichti. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 23 July 2007. Description The adult Peaks of Otter salamander is characterized by a dark-brown dorsum with heavy brassy flecking down its entire length. The dorsum and sides of P. hubrichti may also be lightly speckled with white, while the venter is not spotted and ranges from light to charcoal grey in color. Males have small mental glands immediately behind the chin.Petranka, J. 1998. Salamanders of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 583 pp. While the Peaks of Otter salamander is superficially similar to the Cheat Mountain salamander (P. nettingi), the two species are differentiated by a higher concentration of metallic flecking on the dorsum of P. hubrichti, and the presence of a usual 19 costal grooves compared to the variable 17-19 costal grooves of P. nettingi. Although Petranka stated that hatchlings have a distinct dorsal stripe consisting of reddish spots, this was never seen in over 100 neonates observed, which have a uniform dark-grey dorsum. Brassy flecks begin to appear when salamanders reach about 25 mm snout-to-vent length.Kniowski, A., and N. Reichenbach. 2006. Plethodon hubrichti (Peaks of Otter salamander). Reproduction. Herpetological Review 37: 332. In the early 1950s, the P. cinereus group of small Plethodon species was made up of only three species: the southern ravine salamander (P. richmondi), the Cheat Mountain salamander (P. nettingi), and the eastern red-backed salamander (P. cinereus). Numerous other members of the genus have since been described, including the Peaks of Otter salamander. Naming The story of P. hubrichti's naming began in 1949 with a typewriter salesman, Leslie Hubricht, who also collected and studied land snails. Hubricht encountered salamanders in his pursuit of snails because of their similar habitats, and sent any unusual salamanders he found to museums for identification. Some salamanders he had collected in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia were identified as P. nettingi by herpetologist Gordon Thurow. If true, this would have represented a significant range extension for P. nettingi, since this species had been known only from West Virginia. Richard Hoffman and Richard Highton also examined these specimens, and suspected they actually represented a new species or subspecies.Highton, R. 2009. The Discovery of Plethodon hoffmani and Plethodon hubrichti and Why Richard L. Hoffman Became a Myriapodologist. Pp. 55-57, in S.M. Roble and J.C. Mitchell (eds.). 2009. A Lifetime of Contributions to Myriapodology and the Natural History of Virginia: A Festschrift in Honor of Richard L. Hoffman’s 80th Birthday. Virginia Museum of Natural History Special Publication No. 16, Martinsville, VA. Hoffman and Highton successfully located Hubricht’s collection site about 0.9 miles south of the Black Rock Hill Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway, and after collecting and examining 24 of their own specimens, confirmed their suspicions that this was a new species. The two prepared a manuscript describing the salamander, which they designated P. aureolus, and planned to submit the account for publication by December of 1956. However, P. aureolus was never to officially exist as the scientific name for the salamander discovered by Leslie Hubricht in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Shortly before Hoffman and Highton’s manuscript was submitted, Highton phoned Gordon Thurow, who was in the army at the time, and was stationed near where he lived. Richard invited Gordon and his wife over for dinner at their home. During the phone conversation, Richard told Gordon that he had found Leslie Hubricht’s site along the Blue Ridge Parkway and that Gordon had misidentified the specimens Hubricht collected as P. nettingi. Richard also told Gordon that the specimens were of a new species and that he and Richard Hoffman were in the process of describing it. When Gordon and his wife came over for dinner, Richard showed Gordon the new specimens Hoffman and he had collected. During the visit, Gordon never mentioned that right after he received the phone call from Richard Highton, he rushed to Hubricht’s collection site and collected some specimens for himself. He then swiftly submitted his own description of this new species,Thurow, G. 1957. A new Plethodon from Virginia. Herpetologica. 13: 59-66. giving the Peaks of Otter salamander its official specific epithet of hubrichti. This less-than- honorable rush to be the first to name this new species, plus other similar events, caused Richard Hoffman, a budding Virginian herpetologist at the time, to look for another group of animals in the forests of Virginia that needed taxonomic work. He decided to work with millipedes. Distribution The Peaks of Otter salamander is endemic to a 19-km stretch along the Blue Ridge Parkway in the Peaks of Otter area of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Bedford, Botetourt, and Rockbridge Counties of west-central Virginia. P. hubrichti occupies forest floor habitats and is generally found at elevations above 845 m. Distribution in Allopatry When not in sympatry with the Eastern Red- backed salamander (P. cinerus), P. hubrichti surface-active salamander densities decreased with elevation. Reichenbach and Brophy performed a study between 2008 and 2010 on allopatric populations of P. hubrichti at elevations ranging from 488 to 1143 m. They measured eggs/female, % gravid females, surface-active salamander density, temperature and relative humidity. Surface- active salamander densities, survival rates, growth rates, eggs/female and reproductive output decreased with elevation. Decreases were related to increases in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity associated with decline in elevation https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068727_Natural_History_of_the_Peaks_of_Otter_Salamander_Plethodon_hubrichti_along_an_Elevational_Gradient. Being a montane species, P. hubrichti is affected by even slight changes in the aforementioned environmental factors. This sensitivity to changes in their habitat restricts them from inhabiting lower elevations, where their range may be abiotially limited by the warmer temperatures and drier conditions. Understanding the reasons why the Peaks of Otter salamander has such a restricted distribution can contribute greatly to its conservation. Previous work has shown that, at optimal elevations in the core of its range, P. hubrichti dominates the salamander community and can be found at high population densities (Reichenbach & Sattler, 2007). At the optimal elevation, when shelterwood cuts were conducted (partial removal of trees), the Peaks of Otter salamander densities did not decline following timbering https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of- Herpetology/volume-41/issue-4/06-170.1/Effects-of-Timbering-on-Plethodon- Hubrichti-Over-Twelve-Years/10.1670/06-170.1.short. If these same shelterwood cuts had been conducted in lower elevation areas, however, the already sparse populations of P. hubrichti might have been adversely affected since the forest canopy would have been opened, likely resulting in increased temperatures and decreased RH https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.175. These increased temperatures and decreased RH might exceed or be closer to the tolerable limits for P. hubrichti, which could either extirpate them from these low elevations or reduce densities. Therefore it is important to conserve mature hardwood forests, particularly in lower elevation areas in the perimeter of the Peaks of Otter salamander distribution, which represent more fragile salamander habitats. Reproduction The first observations of a P. hubrichti nest were made in spring and summer of 2005, at a study site near Onion Mountain in Bedford County A cluster of about 10, 5.5-mm-diameter eggs, attended by the brooding female, was found beneath a rock embedded in the soil, hanging from the soil chamber ceiling. After 42-48 days of development, motile embryos with visible eyes were observed in the eggs, and 16 days later, hatchlings were found at the nest site. The number of eggs per female ranged from 1 to 12 with a mean of 8.5 (95% CI 8.2–8.9). The number of eggs per female P. hubrichti increased directly with mass and elevation to a maximum of 12 eggs per female at 1000 m and then decreased slightly above 1000 m. While females found at higher elevations, near optimal elevations, typically produced more eggs per individual there was a greater percentage of females gravid at lower elevations. Combining data on salamander densities, number of eggs per female, and % gravid females (percentage of females in a population that are carrying eggs) allowed for the calculation of reproductive output for populations of salamanders at various elevations. While females at lower elevations reproduced more frequently than females nearer optimal elevations, the pattern for reproductive output was similar to that seen in eggs per female with reproductive output increasing from low elevations to a maximum near 900 m and then declining beyond that elevation https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068727_Natural_History_of_the_Peaks_of_Otter_Salamander_Plethodon_hubrichti_along_an_Elevational_Gradient. Population ecology In comparison to many other terrestrial plethodontids, the Peaks of Otter salamander has a uniquely small distribution, but it may be locally abundant within its range.Kramer, P., N. Reichenbach, M. Hayslett and P. Sattler. 1993. Population dynamics and conservation of the Peaks of Otter salamander, Plethodon hubrichti. Journal of Herpetology 27: 431-435. The extremely limited range of the species and its narrow environmental requirementsArif, S., D. Adams, and J. Wicknick. 2007. Bioclimatic modeling, morphology, and behavior reveal alternative mechanisms regulating the distributions of two parapatric salamander species. Evolutionary Ecology Research 9: 843-854. put P. hubrichti in a tenuous position - easily threatened by forest disruption. The Peaks of Otter salamander is not distributed evenly within its range, and normal movements of individuals are restricted to approximately 1 m; therefore, any habitat alteration could fragment the population and affect the species’ long-term survival. P. hubrichti is estimated to have a population density of 450 salamanders/100 m2, with a median individual home range of 0.6 m2, determined by mark/recapture studies. Adults and juveniles reside mostly under cover objects, such as rocks and logs, and they are actively territorial in defending these against conspecifics. Neonates and young-of-the-year (YOY) are more likely to be found in the leaf litter.Kniowski, A., and N. Reichenbach. 2009. The Ecology of the Peaks of Otter Salamander (Plethodon hubrichti) in sympatry with the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus). Herpetological Conservation and Biology 4: 285-294. Growth rates for various size classes have been estimated, as well. The YOY salamanders were observed to have a growth rate of 0.10 mm/day, while salamanders initially between 31 and 40 mm SVL had a rate of 0.09 mm/day, and those originally between 41 and 50 mm were observed to grow 0.08 mm/day. The Peaks of Otter salamander is primarily active at night, between 8:00 and midnight (9-11 pm in spring, 10-12 pm in summer, and 8-11 pm in autumn). Surface-active individuals are most commonly associated with vegetation, when available, and with leaf litter damp from recent rainfall. The proportion of the population active at the surface immediately following a rainfall increases linearly with length of time between rainfall events. Plethodon salamanders feed on invertebrate prey more likely to be found at the surface, but require moist conditions for cutaneous respiration, causing them to retreat underground when surface moisture is lacking. With longer periods of time between rainfalls, salamanders presumably have less access to food and therefore a larger proportion of the population may be observed foraging at the surface after rain. Comparing P. hubrichti to P. cinereus, a wide-ranging species, provides some understanding as to why P. hubrichti is restricted to higher elevations, great than 488 m. Plethodon cinerus can live in a broader range of temperatures than P. hubrichti, but P. hubrichti can live at lower temperatures than P. cinerus https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of- Herpetology/volume-53/issue-2/18-110/Thermal-Preference-and-Species-Range-in- Mountaintop-Salamanders-and-Their/10.1670/18-110.short. P. hubrichti has a lower critical thermal maximum (temperature at which the organism cannot function) and higher dehydration rates than P. cinerus, restricting it to higher elevations. Such characteristics allow P. hubrichti to do well in higher elevations but also makes them more susceptible to physiological stress from changes in temperature and humidity. The increases in temperature and decreases in relative humidity could keep P. hubrichti from largely inhabiting lower elevational areas because of decreased foraging efficiency https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068727_Natural_History_of_the_Peaks_of_Otter_Salamander_Plethodon_hubrichti_along_an_Elevational_Gradient. As poor thermoregulators, they rely on nocturnal activity, burrowing, and refuges such as rocks and logs to achieve the ideal thermal and moisture conditions. The salamanders typically burrow deep into the soil to escape winter cold and summer heat, as well as dry or otherwise unfavorable conditions. Because of their dependence on moisture, they are most active above the surface directly following a rainfall event https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300921639_The_Importance_of_Microhabitat_A_Comparison_of_Two_Microendemic_Species_of_Plethodon_to_the_Widespread_P_cinereus. In the optimal elevation range (900 to 1000 m) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068727_Natural_History_of_the_Peaks_of_Otter_Salamander_Plethodon_hubrichti_along_an_Elevational_Gradient, P. hubrichti might be able to primarily forage on top of vegetation where they forage with the greatest efficiency Jaeger, R.G. (1978). Plant climbing by salamanders: periodic availability of plant-dwelling prey. Copeia 1978: 686-691.. Poorer environmental conditions at lower elevations force P. hubrichti to forage in less ideal areas such as under rocks and logs to keep from drying out. Such restricted and less efficient foraging along with general physiological stress might result in the decreased reproductive output and survival rates found in salamander populations at lower elevations. Shortened active seasons at elevations above the optimum from decreased temperatures could also influence SA salamander density and reproductive output https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320068727_Natural_History_of_the_Peaks_of_Otter_Salamander_Plethodon_hubrichti_along_an_Elevational_Gradient Community ecology P. hubrichti on a human hand in 2019 For many species, interspecific competition is an important limiting factor of population size, biomass, species richness, and home range sizes. Given the limited distribution of P. hubrichti, it is important to recognize how it may be affected by interspecific competition. The red-backed salamander (P. cinereus), a much more widespread Plethodon, surrounds most of the range of P. hubrichti. Interspecific competition between the Peaks of Otter salamander and the red-backed salamander has generally been considered to limit the distribution of P. hubrichti, since the two species are considered to be equal competitors.Wicknick, J. 1995. Interspecific competition and territoriality between a widespread species of salamander and a species with a limited range. Unpubl. Ph.D. diss., University of Southwestern Louisiana, LafayetteJaeger, R.G., E. Prosen and D. Adams. 2002. Character displacement and aggression in two species of terrestrial salamanders. Copeia 2002:391-401. Being closely related Plethodon species, P. cinereus and P. hubrichti demonstrate a number of behavioral similarities in addition to a similarity in size (6.5-12.5 cm and 8-13 cm total length, respectively). These behaviors include nocturnal foraging in humid conditions, preferring prey lacking a hard cuticle; and defense of a limited (<1 square meters) home range consisting of leaf litter surrounding cover objects. Both species demonstrate aggression and territoriality. Linear movements, home ranges, growth rates and adult survival rates were similar for both species, Adult P. hubrichti densities at 13 allopatric sites ranged from 1.6 to 3.3 salamanders/m2, while in sympatry with P. cinereus, it was 0.6/m2. The combined density for both species at one sympatric site (1.1 salamanders/m2), is comparable to nearby densities for P. hubrichti in allopatry. The depressed density for P. hubrichti in sympatry with P. cinereus suggests the splitting of resources through interspecific competition. The Peaks of Otter salamander may be environmentally restricted, and abiotic climatic features may provide the limiting factor for P. hubrichti, with P. cinereus exhibiting less environmental sensitivity and its range is prevented from encroaching upon allopatric P. hubrichti zones by interspecific competitive with P. hubrichti. The sympatric zones of the red- backed salamander and Peaks of Otter salamander are relatively static.Aasen, G., and N. Reichenbach. 2004. Is the Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus)encroaching upon populations of the Peaks of Otter Salamander (Plethodon hubrichti)? Catesbeiana 24: 17-20 When species proportions at one sympatric site were compared over a 10-year period at a site where the forest was undisturbed, no significant change was noted, with P. hubrichti comprising about 60-70% of salamanders found. However, much of the rest of the sympatric zone is located within timbering areas, where deforestation may affect the environmental factors involved in the balance of the two species. To confirm the role of interspecific competition in sympatric areas with P. hubrichti and P. cinereus, removal studies would need to be conducted where P. cinereus is removed from experimental plots to see if P. hubrichti numbers increase similar to what Hairston (1980) found when P. jordani was removed from plots with P. glutinosus. Plethodontid salamanders such as the Peaks of Otter salamander are responsible for regulating the population of detritivorous invertebrates (i.e. earthworms, etc.) and storing the ecosystem’s nutrients. Due to their critical role in forest condition, as well as their susceptibility to habitat disruptions, plethodontid salamander populations are highly indicative of ecosystem health https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300921639_The_Importance_of_Microhabitat_A_Comparison_of_Two_Microendemic_Species_of_Plethodon_to_the_Widespread_P_cinereus. Conservation Plethodon hubrichti is recognized by the USDA Forest Service as a Sensitive Species because of its limited distribution. It does not have any special legal state or federal protection.VGIF (Virginia Game and Inland Fisheries). 2011. Special Legal Status Faunal Species in Virginia. Where it occurs, the species may be very successful,Reichenbach and Sattler, 2007 and holds its own in undisturbed sympatric zones,Aasen and Reichenbach, 2004 but the Peaks of Otter salamander may be negatively affected by activities that alter the forest canopy, such as timbering. Long-term (12-yearReichenbach, N., and P. Sattler. 2007. Effects of timbering on Plethodon hubrichti over twelve years. Journal of Herpetology 41: 622-29. and short-term (two-yearSattler and Reichenbach, 1998 timbering impacts have been studied and documented in detail. Plethodontid salamanders are lungless and require moist skin for gas exchange, implying the necessity of moist habitats, which can be altered by canopy loss. The reduction of forest canopy by any sort of timbering has many possible ramifications on P. hubrichti food resources, as well. Peaks of Otter salamanders were able to consume a higher proportion of soft-bodied prey items in mature hardwood stands that had never undergone timbering. Soft-bodied invertebrates, such as collembolans, are a more nutritious source of food, and a diet with a high proportion of these prey items may indicate a higher- quality habitat overall. Short-term timbering impacts Sattler and ReichenbachSattler, P., and N. Reichenbach. 1998. The effects of timbering on Plethodon hubrichti: short term effects. Journal of Herpetology 32: 399-404. studied the short-term effects of timbering on the Peaks of Otter salamander. Twelve sites were used, with four sites each randomly assigned to one of three treatments: clearcut (complete canopy removal), shelterwood (partial canopy removal), and reference (no timbering). Population baselines were established the year before timbering began, by conducting night mark/recapture surveys of surface-active animals. Establishing a baseline is a vital step in studying timbering effects, as salamander distribution and dispersal patterns may be clumped, and without a preliminary reference point, it may not be possible to separate dispersal effects and individual site differences from timbering effects. Subsequent surveys were conducted in the next year, after timbering was complete and the year following. Plethodon hubrichti populations were found to remain relatively stable in the shelterwood and reference sites, with the exception of a decrease in the percentage of juveniles in the shelterwood sites. In contrast, the clearcut sites demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in salamander populations. In the second year after clearcutting occurred, only 30% of the baseline population remained at the sites. Estimates of population size from the mark/recapture study demonstrated the progressive decline from year to year in the clearcut sites, contrasted with the steady numbers at the reference site. All surveys were nocturnal and following rainfall, when moisture levels were high; therefore it is unlikely the decreased numbers at the clearcut site were solely due to reduced surface activity following the habitat alteration. Rather, the population decline must be attributed to emigration from the clearcut zones, mortality, or some combination of the two. Significantly, the juvenile proportion of the population two years after timbering was much smaller in both the clearcut and shelterwood treatments than at the reference sites. This effect is attributed to the reduction in shade and soil moisture with canopy loss having a more marked impact on smaller juvenile animals, due to their larger surface area to volume ratio, which increased their susceptibility to desiccation. In summary, clearcutting was shown to have a significant deleterious effect on P. hubrichti populations in the short term, while shelterwood cuts were not injurious overall. Because of the impact clearcutting has on not only the Peaks of Otter Salamander, but also the forest in general,Covington, W.W. 1981. Changes in forest floor organic matter and nutrient content following clear cutting in northern hardwoods. Ecology 62:41-48.Seastedt, T.R. and D.A. Crossley. 1981. Microarthropod response following cable logging and clear- cutting in the southern Appalachians. Ecology 62:126-135.Duffy and Meier, 1992 the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest Service no longer permits clearcutting on the land they manage.George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, and Blue Ridge Parkway National Park Service. 1997. Habitat conservation assessment for the Peaks of Otter Salamander (Plethodon hubrichti). 28pp. Long-term timbering impacts A long-term (12-year) study continuing the work of Sattler and Reichenbach (1998) was conducted to assess population trends on a larger time scale. The same treatment sites and study methods were used. Two years after timbering, the numbers of surface-active animals on the clearcut sites had dropped to 25% of levels before timbering. The population did not begin to recover until five years after timbering, and finally stabilized at only 55% of before-timbering levels. Timbering on the shelterwood sites was ultimately not shown to have a significant long-term impact on P. hubrichti populations. As discussed for short-term timbering effects, population declines in clearcut sites may be attributed to mortality, emigration, or some combination of the two. Immediately after timbering, 41% of the salamanders relocated from transects established at the edge of clearcuts to reference transects that were 3–9 m distant.Reichenbach, N., and P. Sattler. 2007. Effects of timbering on Plethodon hubrichti over twelve years. Journal of Herpetology 41: 622-29. This was surprising, since Plethodon salamanders are highly philopatric, not typically emigrating long distances under normal circumstances, and P. hubrichti typically has a home range of <1 m2, It is not known if the salamanders would be capable of moving much longer distances to more suitable habitat after clearcuts, nor if they would be capable of surviving in these new locales. Long-term studies are beneficial for separating the effects of normal population fluctuations from the effects of timbering. Reference site levels of P. hubrichti varied from 0.19 to 0.35 surface-active salamanders/m2 during the course of the study, with a complete oscillation over an 11-year period around a mean of 0.28/m2. Had the study been shorter, the population would have appeared to decline overall instead of varying. With this variation at reference sites as a comparison, clearcuts evidently have a significant negative impact on Peaks of Otter salamander populations, with no signs of complete recovery even 12 years after timbering. While shelterwood cuts do not leave the population completely unscathed, they are not harmful in the long term, and if applied judiciously they may be used in allopatric areas where populations of P. hubrichti are otherwise stable. The most significant timbering question concerns the sympatric zone with P. hubrichti and P. cinereus. Kniowski and Reichenbach hypothesize that timbering, especially clearcuts, would cause an increase in temperature and decrease in moisture on the forest floor, and this, in turn, might favor the more widespread P. cinereus, as this species may be more resistant to increased temperatures and evaporation rates.

It is endemic to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. Description The red-cheeked salamander is a uniform steely grey colour with conspicuous red, orange or yellow patches on the side of the head. The imitator salamander (Desmognathus imitator) is thought to be a mimic and is very similar in appearance but has a pale line joining jaw to eye and more robust hind legs. An adult red-cheeked salamander found under a rock in extreme western North Carolina Distribution and habitat The red-cheeked salamander is found in mountainous areas of the south eastern United States. The main populations are along the border between North Carolina and Tennessee but separate populations occurs in Rabun County, Georgia. The altitude range is 210 to 1950 metres (700 to 6400 ft) but few specimens are found below . Almost the whole altitude range occurs within the boundaries of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The red-cheeked salamander is a terrestrial species and is found in both hardwood and coniferous forests, particularly in red spruce and Fraser fir woodland. It is plentiful in areas with a ground cover of moss and leaf litter among large boulders. Biology The red-cheeked salamander conceals itself during the day under rocks and in or under rotten logs. It has extensive shallow burrows through which it can move about. At night and during rain it emerges onto the surface to forage. Each salamander has a small home range which is about for a male and for a female. When displaced by a distance of or more, most salamanders managed to return to their home. The red-cheeked salamander feeds on small invertebrates including worms, snails, springtails, spiders, insects and insect larvae. Creatures that prey on the red-cheeked salamander include birds, the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), the blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) and the spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). When attacked, it turns its tail towards the predator and emits a sticky, noxious mucus. It may bite the head of a snake or twine its tail round its head. Another defensive strategy is the autotomisation of its tail, which may leave the predator a tasty morsel while the salamander flees. Little is known of the breeding habits of the red- cheeked salamander but they are likely to be similar to those of other members of the genus Plethodon with a clutch of eggs being brooded by the female and each egg developing directly into a juvenile without an intervening larval stage. Status The red-cheeked salamander is listed as being \\"Near Threatened\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The population of the species appears to be stable but the area of its range is less than . Balancing this, it is common in many locations, tolerates forestry disturbance and lives completely within the confines of the national park. The main threats may be acid rain, climate change and the damage to forests caused by the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae).

It is endemic to the Ouachita Mountains in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. Its natural habitat is temperate forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description Rich Mountain salamanders grow to a length of about , snout to vent. They are mottled and slatey-grey in colour which makes them inconspicuous. There are glands on their backs which secrete a noxious substance to deter predators. Distribution and habitat The Rich Mountain salamander was first collected at Rich Mountain east of Page, Oklahoma in the Ouachita Mountains. Where their range overlaps that of the Fourche Mountain salamander (Plethodont fourchensis), some hybridization occurs. Their habitat is mixed deciduous woodland particularly on north facing slopes near wet seeps. They are also found on scree slopes, under logs, rocks and debris and in cave entrances. Biology The males defend territories and drive off other male salamanders. Breeding takes place in the late autumn, winter and early spring in burrows in scree and caves. About sixteen eggs are brooded by the female and hatch directly into juvenile salamanders without any intervening larval stage. The juveniles occupy the same habitat as the adults and both feed among the leaf litter on small invertebrates such as insects and their larvae, worms and spiders. They are largely nocturnal but sometimes move about by day in wet weather. The adults may aestivate from May till September though the juveniles remain active for at least part of this time. In the winter they probably hibernate and the females probably only breed every alternate year. Status In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Rich Mountain salamander is considered to be \\"Near threatened\\". This is because, although it is abundant in parts of its range, there are a number of separate populations which could be impacted by local events. It is vulnerable to habitat destruction and clear felling but some of its range is in protected areas.

At the time, the Julian calendar was in use in Russia; according to this calendar, he was born on 10 February. Pg. 74. – September 1937) was a Soviet legal scholar, best known for his work The General Theory of Law and Marxism. Early life and October Revolution Pashukanis was born in Staritsa, in the Tver Governorate in the Russian Empire. The Pashukanis family was of Lithuanian background; he was a cousin of the publisher, Vikentiy Pashukanis. Influenced by his family, particularly his uncle, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party (RSLDP) in Saint Petersburg at the age of 17. In 1909, he started studying jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. As a result of his socialist activism, the Czarist police threatened Pashukanis with banishment, so he left Russia for Germany in 1910. He continued his studies in Munich. During World War I, he returned to his native Russia. In 1914, he helped draft the RSLDP resolution opposing the war. Following the 1917 October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union, Pashukanis joined the Russian Communist Party, the Bolshevik wing of the RSLDP, after its founding in 1918. In August 1918, he became a judge in Moscow. Meanwhile, he launched his career as a legal scholar. He also held a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was an adviser to the Soviet embassy in Berlin, helping to draft the Rapallo Treaty of 1922. In 1924 he was transferred to full-time academic duties as a member of the Communist Academy.Kamenka/Tay 1970, pg. 72; By 1930, Pashukanis was the Vice President of the Communist Academy. The General Theory of Law and Marxism In 1924, Pashukanis published his seminal work, The General Theory of Law and Marxism. This is best known for Pashukanis' formulation of the \\"Commodity Exchange Theory of Law\\". This theory was built on two pillars of Marxist thought: (1) in the organization of society the economic factor is paramount; legal and moral principles and institutions therefore constitute a kind of superstructure reflecting the economic organization of society; and (2) in the finally achieved state of communism, law and the state will wither away. If communism is achieved, morality as it is typically understood will cease to perform any function. :«Why does class rule not remain what it is, the factual subjugation of one section of the population by the other? Why does it assume the form of official state rule, or - which is the same thing – why does the machinery of state coercion not come into being as the private machinery of the ruling class; why does it detach itself from the ruling class and take on the form of an impersonal apparatus of public power, separate from society? […] Another of the things with which Comrade Stuchka reproaches me - namely that I recognise the existence of law only in bourgeois society, I grant…» (E. B. Pashukanis, The General Theory of Law and Marxism, 1924). Latter years From 1925 to 1927, Pyotr Stuchka, another Soviet legal scholar, and Pashukanis compiled an Encyclopedia of State and Law and started a journal named Revolution of Law. In 1927, he was elected a full member of the Communist Academy, eventually becoming its vice-president. He and Stuchka started a section on the General Theory of State and Law at the Academy. However, in 1930, Nikolai Bukharin was attacked by Stalin, because he insisted that the state must wither away to bring forth communism, as Marx had advocated. He was then stripped of all his political posts. Pashukanis soon came under pressure from the government as well. As a result, Pashukanis started to revise his theory of state. He stopped working with his friend Stuchka. It is unclear whether Pashukanis's transformation was simply the result of fear for his safety, or whether he actually changed his mind. He was rewarded by being made director of the Institute of Soviet Construction and Law (predecessor of the Institute of State and Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences) in 1931. In 1936, he was nominated as Deputy Commissar of Justice of the USSR and was proposed for membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences.Kamenka/Tay 1970, pg. 73 and Harms 2002. According to Andreas Harms, Pashukanis was denounced as an \\"enemy of the people\\" by Pyotr Yudin. On 20 January 1937, Pashukanis was arrested and Andrey Vyshinsky soon replaced him at the Institute of Soviet Construction and Law. Alfred Krishianovich Stalgevich, a longtime critic of Pashukanis, took over his courses at the Moscow Juridical Institute.Kamenka/Tay 1970, pg. 73. Pashukanis, after publishing many self-criticisms, was eventually denounced as a \\"trotskyite saboteur\\" in 1937 and executed in September 1937. Pashukanis was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957, although his theories were not adopted by mainstream Soviet jurisprudence at that time. See also *Evgeny A.

This instrument of torture was used during late Middle Ages and early modern times for enforcement of confessions. The Nuremberg Plate consisted of a rotating disc, that was mounted horizontally to the floor. The disc was powered by one or two torturers using a crank handle. The victim was locked into position with arm- and legchains on the spinning disc. Because of centrifugal forces the victim suffered from disturbances of equilibrium, circulatory disorder and regurgitation. Because torturing with the Nuremberg Plate often did not result in visible or serious injury, it was mainly used for the interrogation of privileged persons. Reports about a tightened variant of the Nuremberg Plate, in which blades were moved from above towards the victim of torture, could not be confirmed unambiguously. It may be a myth, going back to the vivid fantasy of early modern times illustrators. In its city of origin Nuremberg the Plate was presumably never used outside of the Nuremberg Castle.

Habitat The natural habitat of P. richmondi is temperate forests, in which it prefers the slopes of valleys and ravines.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + 48 plates. (hardcover), (paperback). (Plethodon richmondi, pp. 274-275, Figure 86 + Plate 41 + Map 231). It is a terrestrial species and is found among the leaf litter, hiding under logs, stones or stumps. It hibernates underground in winter and aestivates at the height of summer. Eggs are laid in cracks and crevices and develop directly into juvenile salamanders without an intervening larval stage. Conservation status The main threats facing the ravine salamander are degradation of its habitat, and some sub-populations have been destroyed by this.

The Shenandoah salamander inhabits a very small range of land on just three mountain peaks. Due to the small habitat range, interspecies competition, and climate change, the population of the Shenandoah salamander is vulnerable to extinction. Mitigating human effects on the habitat of the species will be essential in attempting to preserve and grow the population  Description  The adult Shenandoah salamander is slender and moderate in size, with a total length of 3.5 to 4.5 inches (7 cm - 10 cm).U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 1994. Shenandoah salamander (Plethodori shenandoah) Recovery Plan. Hadley, Massachusetts. 36 pp. The species has two distinct color phases: striped and unstriped. The striped color phase has a narrow stripe down the center of its back that can range in color from red to yellow, while the unstriped color phase is uniformly dark with occasional scattered brass-colored flecks. In both color phases, white or yellow spots occur along the sides of the body. The Shenandoah salamander is similar in appearance to the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). However, the two species can be distinguished in many ways. The stripe on the Shenandoah salamander takes up one-third of its dorsal area, while the stripe on the red-backed salamander is wider and takes up approximately two-thirds of the dorsal area. In addition, the Shenandoah salamander lacks the “salt and pepper” color pattern on its underside that is characteristic of P. cinereus, and has a slightly larger and more broadly rounded head. Shenandoah salamanders are members of the family Plethondontidae, the lungless salamanders that breathe through the surface of the skin. Due to the lack of lungs, successful respiration depends on the ability to maintain skin moisture, thus restricting body size and necessitating a moist environment such as forested areas. This species is chiefly nocturnal, hunting for food at night and taking cover in dark, damp locations like rock crevices and underneath logs during the day.  Life History  Like most woodland salamanders, the Shenandoah salamander eats mites, flies, small beetles, springtails, and other soil invertebrates.T. K. Pauley 1980. The ecological status of the Cheat Mountain Salamander. United States Department of Agriculture. Forest Service, Elkins, WV. Report 7798. 160. Pp. No direct observation of predation of the Shenandoah salamander has ever been reported, but potential predators residing within the habitat of the Shenandoah salamander include ring-necked snakes, short-tailed shrews, brown thrashers, and towhees. The Shenandoah salamander’s life history is not well understood, though adult salamanders have a high survival rate, some even reaching 25 years of age. Like many salamanders, the breeding season for the Shenandoah salamander occurs during late spring or summer. Female salamanders do not breed prior to 4 years of age and lay an average clutch size of 13 eggs every other year. Clutches are laid in areas of moisture and incubate for 1-3 months. Fertilization occurs internally and the entire developmental process takes place within the egg - there is no aquatic larval stage. For the duration of the incubation period, females guard the nest and do not forage. All salamanders, including the Shenandoah salamander, have an important impact on ecosystem functions. Salamanders regulate population dynamics via predation of insects and other invertebrates, aerate the soil through burrowing behavior, and influence large-scale processes such as decomposition.  Distribution   Habitat range  The Shenandoah salamander species is believed to have originated in the Appalachians of eastern North America, though the historical abundance of this species is unknown. Currently, Shenandoah salamanders are exclusively found on the north-facing talus slopes of three mountains within the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia: Hawksbill, The Pinnacles, and Stony Man (see range map). Each of the three talus slopes houses an isolated salamander population residing at approximately 3,000 feet above sea level.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1989). Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Cheat Mountain Salamander and Endangered Status for the Shenandoah Salamander. Federal Register, 54(159), 34464-68. The talus slopes are typically dry, so the Shenandoah salamander is generally found within moist microhabitats scattered throughout the talus environment. Although the dry talus slopes are not optimal, the Shenandoah salamander is excluded from optimal forested areas containing deep, moist soil due to competition with the red-backed salamander.  Population size  Based on data from 2008/2009 there was a population estimate between 110,262 to 140,625, but current population trends and estimates cannot be established until surveys with marked animals are conducted.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2012). Programmatic Biological Opinion for Shenandoah National Park Ongoing Management Activities.  Major threats   Red-backed salamander  The Shenandoah salamander species is threatened by competition by the aggressive red-backed salamander, which restricts the Shenandoah salamander to dry, sub-optimal talus environments and prevents Shenandoah salamander populations from expanding into heavily forested areas. Furthermore, the talus habitat of the Shenandoah salamander is in a state of disintegration due to erosion. Eventually, this weathering will result in soil formation and a subsequent increase in moisture, thus making the talus environment suitable for red-backed salamander invasion and increasing the possibility of extinction of the Shenandoah salamander species Both laboratory and field experiments have provided evidence of the red-backed salamander’s aggressive, territorial behavior toward the Shenandoah salamander. The two species compete for large cover objects that provide cool temperatures and high moisture levels, but the territoriality of P. cinereus results in competitive exclusion of the Shenandoah salamander from moist soil environments. As a result, the Shenandoah salamander, which has a higher tolerance for dry conditions, is restricted to the talus slope environments in which the red-backed salamander cannot survive.  Invasive species  Invasive insect species in the Shenandoah National Park, namely the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) and the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), also threaten the survival of the Shenandoah salamander. Gypsy moth larvae feed on tree leaves, resulting in widespread defoliation and tree mortality. This loss of overstory dramatically alters the Shenandoah salamander habitat, reducing the ground moisture and potentially altering the Shenandoah salamander’s ability to catch prey. Hemlock woolly adelgids are a major cause of hemlock tree mortality within Shenandoah National Park, contributing to overstory loss and talus slope habitat dehydration. In addition, hemlock mortality increases the amount of hemlock needles in the soil, which lowers the pH of the soil. Acid deposition due to acid rain and/or air pollution also contributes to soil acidification and has been well-documented in Shenandoah National Park. Although the direct effects of soil acidification on the Shenandoah salamander have not been documented, studies have shown that amphibians are extremely vulnerable to this process. Corn, P. S., Stolzenburg, W., & Bury, R. B. (1989). Acid precipitation studies in Colorado and Wyoming: interim report of surveys of montane amphibians and water chemistry. Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Research and Development. These results suggest that soil acidification within the Shenandoah salamander habitat could reduce reproduction, affect food supply, lower egg hatchability, and increase newborn salamander mortality.  Chytrid fungus  Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans or Salamander Chytrid fungus causes the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, which is considered to be a large factor in the declining populations of amphibians globally.Martel, An, et al. “Batrachochytrium Salamandrivorans Sp. Nov. Causes Lethal Chytridiomycosis in Amphibians.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 110, no. 38, 2013, pp. 15325–15329. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42713321. Accessed 2 Apr. 2020. In 2016, an interim rule by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) added all species of salamander to the list of injurious amphibians. This rule prevented the importation or transportation of any live of dead specimens, including parts, of the 20 genera of salamanders into the United States and interstate transportation between States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.Injurious Wildlife Species; Listing Salamanders Due to Risk of Salamander Chytrid Fungus. (2016, January 13). Retrieved from https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2016-00452 Only with the exception of permit for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes or by Federal agencies without a permit solely for their own use. This interim rule was a proactive rule to protect the wildlife from the introduction, establishment, and spread of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans. While this fungus had a lethal effect on many salamander species, it was not currently known to be found in the United States; however, the potential introduction of the fungus upon the salamander species could have an incredibly devastating effect.  Anthropogenic factors  Anthropogenic factors also appear to potentially further endanger the Shenandoah salamander. In the 1994 recovery plan, it was thought that further debilitation of overstory vegetation, changes in soil chemistry, and direct impacts to the salamanders associated with acid deposition and other sources of air pollution were potential threats. While there were no effects of acid deposition and other sources of air pollution on the Shenandoah salamander, there have been numerous studies which indicate amphibians to be very vulnerable to effects of acid deposition, especially in montane areas. Acidification of the habitat could affect the salamander’s food supply, could impair reproduction by affecting courtship, egg hatchability, or neonatal viability. Studies showed that soil acidity decreased the abundance of the red-backed salamander, making it likely for the Shenandoah salamander to also be negatively affected. Finally, there was the potential disturbance to the habitat of the Shenandoah salamander due to hiking trail maintenance, use, and backcountry camping.  Climate change  Climate change also directly impacts the habitat of the Shenandoah salamander. Cloud base elevation, which is influenced by climate variables, is likely to continue to shrink the suitable range of the Shenandoah salamander.Grant, Evan H. Campbell, et al. “Evidence That Climate Sets the Lower Elevation Range Limit in a High‐Elevation Endemic Salamander.” Ecology and Evolution, vol. 8, no. 15, 2018, pp. 7553–7562., doi:10.1002/ece3.4198. One study found that elevation is strongly correlated with the lower elevation range boundary for the Shenandoah salamander, despite previous assumptions that the range was limited only to competitive interactions. The lower elevational range is sensitive to climate variables, so climate change in high elevation habitats will directly affect the species’ distribution.  Conservation status  In December 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service categorized the Shenandoah salamander as a “Category 2” in its Review of Vertebrate Wildlife for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1982). Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Review of Vertebrate Wildlife for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species. Federal Register, 47(251), 58454-60. In 1989, the Shenandoah salamander was formally classified as “Endangered” under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The Shenandoah salamander was first listed as Endangered (E) by the IUCN in 1994, and retained its Endangered status in a 1996 assessment.Geoffrey Hammerson, Joseph Mitchell 2004. Plethodon shenandoah. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2004: e.T17629A7210465. https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2004.RLTS.T17629A7210465.en. Downloaded on 02 April 2020. In 2004, the Shenandoah salamander was listed as Vulnerable D2 (VU) by the IUCN, with the justification that it was found in only three locations.  Critical habitat  In 2015, the Center for Biological Diversity presented a petition for designating a critical habitat for nine species including the Shenandoah salamander. The Center requested that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designate 16,891 acres within the Shenandoah National Park as critical habitat for the Shenandoah Salamander.Center for Biological Diversity (2015). Petition to the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for Rulemakings Designating Critical Habitat for Nine Northeast Species. https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/freshwater_mussels/pdfs/CBD_Critical_Habitat_petition_for_9_northeast_species.pdf As the salamander requires very specific habitat conditions, and is restricted to the high-elevation mountains in Virginia, it is under an increasing threat from climate change, invasive species, pollution, and human activities. Designating this area as a critical habitat would address potentially incompatible Park Service management and would be beneficial for the conservation of the Salamander species.  Current conservation efforts   Original 1994 Recovery Plan  The 1994 recovery plan explained that due to the interspecific competition, the Shenandoah Salamander differs from other listed species. Because of this competition, it would not be advisable to attempt to increase population numbers, transplant individuals, or reduce naturally occurring competitors. Attempts to repopulate the salamander on talus areas between or adjacent to known populations would be unfeasible, costly, and unnecessary. Instead, recovery attempts should focus on minimizing human-related impacts on the Shenandoah and red-backed salamander populations. The actions needed for the recovery of the Shenandoah Salamander included determining the boundaries of occupied habitat and to determine if additional populations exist, monitoring the known salamander populations on a long-term basis, determining and minimizing the impact of human-related factors such as herbicides and air-pollutants on the salamander, investigating aspects of the salamander’s life history, ensuring compatibility of park maintenance and management activities with the salamander populations, and promoting information exchange on the salamander. This recovery plan was estimated to take 3 fiscal years with a total cost of $155,000.  5-Year reviews  In both 2008 and 2012, a 5-Year Review of several species, including the Shenandoah salamander, was conducted. These reviews aimed to find whether these species were properly classified under the Endangered Species Act. In both reviews the Shenandoah salamander retained the status of “endangered\\".U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2008). Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Initiation of 5-Year Reviews of 10 Listed Species. Federal Register, 73(15), 3991-93.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2012). Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Initiation of a 5-Year Review of Nine Northeastern Species. Federal Register, 77(44), 13251-53.  Biological Opinion by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  In 2012, the USFWS submitted a Biological Opinion on the National Park Service’s (NPS) management activities, which highlighted some proposed actions to protect the areas of the Shenandoah National Park. This proposed action in fire management, natural resource protection, and natural resource monitoring and research. A policy that would specifically impact the Shenandoah salamander was the proposed aerial spraying of Bacillus thuringiensis as a pest management technique to reduce the impact of gypsy moths.  Supplemental Finding for the Shenandoah Salamander Recovery Plan  An additional resource to the Shenandoah Salamander recovery plan was published in July, 2019. This resource explained why it remained impractical, as of 2019, to de-list the Shenandoah salamander.U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Chesapeake Bay Field Office (2019). Supplemental Finding for Shenandoah Salamander (Plethodon shenandoah) Recovery Plan. In 1994, the sole threat to the species was competition with the red- backed salamander. In the absence of anthropogenic threats, the USFWS determined that it was not possible to establish criteria to de-list or down- list the species in the foreseeable future. As the species is endemic to higher elevations and the range is protected by the National Park Services, human impacts are minimized. However, in the time since the 1994 recovery plan, available science has brought the original analysis into question. Since the recovery plan was established, evidence has emerged that climate change may be a primary threat to the species, potentially influencing competition.  Future conservation efforts  As of 2020, there have been no listing changes to the conservation status of the Shenandoah salamander. However, there are several studies set to begin in 2020 by the NPS and United States Geological Survey which will focus on why the Shenandoah salamander is exhibiting greater declines than most amphibian species, and biologists plan to develop a management plan at the conclusion of those studies. The future 5-Year Review (set for 2022) can assess the practicality of amending the recovery plan to include de-listing criteria and updating the plan to include additional threats.

Its common name refers to the Big Levels area of southeastern Augusta County, Virginia, a series of flat to gently rolling mountain tops in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where it was found. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to its limited distribution. Little is known about its conservation status or threats, but it maybe threatened by logging-related ecosystem degradation. Description The Big Levels salamander is a small salamander of the genus Plethodon within the Plethodon cinereus group (the red-backed salamander and closely related species). Physically, it is most similar to P. cinereus and P. serratus, which have gray and white (sometimes yellow) coloring on the underside of the body. Plethodon sherando has a greater amount of white pigmentation than gray. The back is red and gray, sometimes with stripes or spots.

Formerly considered a subspecies of Plethodon jordani, it is native to the mountain forests of the southeastern United States. Description They tend to be somewhere between 85-185mm in length and are characterized by their slate-grey to bluish-black bodies and red coloration on their dorsal side of their legs. In the Unicoi Mountains it rarely has red coloration on the legs, but has lateral white spotting. Sexually active males have obvious, rounded mental glands. Young juveniles may have paired red spots running along the back. It is a terrestrial breeder. Habitat The red-legged salamanders make their habitats in cool, moderately humid forests in areas of high elevation, such as the Unicoi and Nantahala mountains as well as the southern Appalachians. While the species is mainly concentrated in North Carolina, they are also found in northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee. Due to being indigenous to less than five known regions, the species has been labeled as vulnerable to extinction. This species shelters under logs or rocks by day, and forages on the forest floor at night. Diet The red-legged salamander is a nocturnal forager that consumes a wide variety of small invertebrates found on the forest floor. Courtship pheromones When courtship occurs, we see that adult male plethodontid salamanders transfer protein pheromones that augment female receptivity. The majority of plethodontid species apply pheromones transdermally to the female's dorsal skin. These pheromones will have diffused through the skin and enter into circulation, a unique type of pheromone delivery in vertebrates. In contrast, a behavioral and physiological transition occurred in the Plethodontinae, resulting in one clade of species (Plethodon glutinosus group) that uses a different pheromone delivery mode. We see that males within this clade apply pheromones directly to the nares of a female, and the pheromones subsequently are detected by the vomeronasal organ. Than they staged courtship encounters and recorded the behavior of females given either pheromones or control solutions on the dorsal skin for Female receptivity. They found that female red legged salamanders are not stimulated by pheromones delivered dermally and alludes that this condition may characterize all the members of the P. glutinosus group, which use olfactory pheromone delivery. Conservation actions Most of the range occurs in the Nantahala National Forest, where some clear cutting also occurs. Benefits of the species should come with the conservation actions being taken. The species does not appear to be on any state or federal list of endangered species. Red-legged salamanders are relatively resilient to disturbances such as those associated with timbering operations, and are frequently found in second-growth forests and relatively small, fragmented woodlots.

After the heavy fighting in late 1917, the division was transferred to the army reserve and began training as an assault division. Beginning in March 1918, it took a leading role in the German Spring Offensive, including the breakthrough at St.Quentin-La Fère, the fighting over the crossings of the Somme river and the Crozat canal, and the fighting around Montdidier and Noyon.Histories, pp.105-107 After the failure of the Spring Offensive, the division returned to the trenchlines. In May–June 1918, it fought in the battles of Soissons and Reims.

She was Electress of Brandenburg by marriage to Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg.  Early life Hedwig was born on March 15, 1513 in Poznań. She was the eldest daughter of King Sigismund I the Old of Poland and his first wife, Hungarian Countess Barbara Zápolya, sister of the later King John I of Hungary. Her only full sibling, Anna, died at age 5. Her father remarried and had six children with his second wife. Although she grew up with her half brothers and sisters, she had personal tutors, and in the court she received the nickname of \\"reginula\\".Dr. Veress, Endre (1901). Izabella kiralyne. Budapest. Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia. Hedwig was described by Olaus Magnus, who met her in 1528, as a \\"very beautiful, wise maiden [...] finer than all the riches I have just mentioned, and worthy of a glorious realm.\\" Her hand was first sought by King Gustav I of Sweden, who was determined to make her his first queen. In 1526, Johannes Magnus was sent to Poland by the King of Sweden to negotiate the marriage. Despite the suitor's decision to moderate the religious reforms in his kingdom, Hedwig's father declined Gustav's offer after hearing about Gustav's ill relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, and the opportunity to become Queen of Sweden perished (only to be presented later to Hedwig's half-sister Catherine).  Electress consort of Brandenburg  The next suitor was from Brandenburg. The intensely Catholic Georg von Blumenthal, Bishop of Lebus, was sent to negotiate the marriage. On 29 August or 1 September 1535 Hedwig married Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg. The wedding was held in Kraków. As the Jagiellon dynasty was Catholic, Joachim II promised Sigismund he would not make Hedwig change her religion and gave her as a dower the county of Ruppin as well as the cities Alt Ruppin and Neuruppin. The marriage contract, signed on 21 March 1535, stipulated that Hedwig would be allowed to bring a Polish priest with her and always be free in the exercise of Catholic prayers. The marriage did not satisfy Hedwig's mother-in-law, Elizabeth of Denmark, a devout Protestant, for Catholic services were held for Hedwig in her private chapel. The Dowager Electress was also unhappy because Hedwig could not speak German. After breaking her thigh and hurting her back in the collapse of a floor at a hunting lodge, Hedwig spent the last 22 years of her life crippled. The accident signified the collapse of her marriage, which was already damaged by differences in religion and language. Hedwig was replaced by her husband's mistress, Anna Sydow, whom Joachim treated as his wife and who was recognized publicly. Hedwig died in Neuruppin on 7 February 1573, two years after her husband. She is one of the characters on the famous painting by Jan Matejko, Prussian Homage. Issue Hedwig and Joachim had sixteen children: * Elisabeth Magdalena (6 September 1537 – 22 August 1595); married Francis Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. *Sigismund (2 December 1538 – 14 September 1566), Bishop of Magdeburg and Halberstadt. * Hedwig (2 March 1540 – 21 October 1602); married Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. * Sophia (14 December 1541 – 27 June 1564); married of Wiliam of Rosenberg. * Joachim (1543 – 23 March 1544) * Unnamed daughter (born in 1545) Ancestry  References  - Category:1513 births Category:1573 deaths Category:Jagiellonian dynasty Category:House of Hohenzollern Category:16th-century Polish people Category:16th-century Polish women Category:16th-century German people Category:16th-century German women Category:Polish princesses Category:Electresses of Brandenburg ","title":"Hedwig Jagiellon, Electress of Brandenburg"},{"id":"12403963","text":"The Webster's salamander (Plethodon websteri) is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae.

The term commonly refers to devices such as ROMs, PALs, PLAs and GALs.  Basic description  Simple programmable logic devices (SPLD) are the simplest, smallest and least-expensive forms of programmable logic devices. SPLDs can be used in boards to replace standard logic components (AND, OR, and NOT gates), such as 7400-series TTL. They typically comprise 4 to 22 fully connected macrocells. These macrocells typically consist of some combinatorial logic (such as AND OR gates) and a flip-flop. In other words, a small Boolean logic equation can be built within each macrocell. This equation will combine the state of some number of binary inputs into a binary output and, if necessary, store that output in the flip-flop until the next clock edge. Of course, the particulars of the available logic gates and flip-flops are specific to each manufacturer and product family. But the general idea is always the same. Most SPLDs use either fuses or non-volatile memory cells (EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH, and others) to define the functionality. These devices are also known as: * Programmable array logic (PAL) * Generic array logic (GAL) * Programmable logic arrays (PLA) * Field-programmable logic arrays (FPLA) * Programmable logic devices (PLD)  Advantages  PLDs are often used for address decoding, where they have several clear advantages over the 7400-series TTL parts that they replaced: One chip requires less board area, power, and wiring than several do. The design inside the chip is flexible, so a change in the logic does not require any rewiring of the board. Rather, simply replacing one PLD with another part that has been programmed with the new design can alter the decoding logic.  Functions  Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are digital devices with configurable logic and flip-flops linked together with programmable interconnect. Logic devices provide specific functions, including: * Device-to-device interfacing * Data communication * Signal processing * Data display * Timing * Control operations * Almost every other function a system must perform Memory cells control and define the function that the logic performs and how the various logic functions are interconnected.  Fixed vs. programmable  Logic devices can be classified into two broad categories - fixed and programmable. Fixed Logic Devices : As the name suggests, the circuits in a fixed logic device are permanent, they perform one function or set of functions - once manufactured, they cannot be changed. With fixed logic devices, the time required to go from design, to prototypes, to a final manufacturing run can take from several months to more than a year, depending on the complexity of the device. And, if the device does not work properly, or if the requirements change, a new design must be developed. Programmable Logic Devices : On the other hand, programmable logic devices (PLDs) are standard, off-the-shelf parts that offer customers a wide range of logic capacity, features, speed, and voltage characteristics - and these devices can be changed at any time to perform any number of functions. With programmable logic devices, designers use inexpensive software tools to quickly develop, simulate, and test their designs. Then, a design can be quickly programmed into a device, and immediately tested in a live circuit. The PLD that is used for this prototyping is exactly the same PLD that will be used in the final production of a piece of end equipment, such as a network router, a DSL modem, a DVD player, or an automotive navigation system. There are no NRE costs and the final design is completed much faster than that of a custom, fixed logic device. Another key benefit of using PLDs is that during the design phase customers can change the circuitry as often as they want until the design operates to their satisfaction. That's because PLDs are based on re-writeable memory technology - to change the design, simply reprogram the device. Once the design is final, customers can go into immediate production by simply programming as many PLDs as they need with the final software design file. Generally, PLDs can be described as being one of three different types: * Simple Programmable Logic Devices (SPLDs) * Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs) * Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)  Architecture  There are several manufacturers with many different families of PLD devices, so there are many variations in architecture. The two major types of programmable logic devices are field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). The distinction between the two is often a little fuzzy, with manufacturers designing new, improved architectures, and frequently muddying the waters for marketing purposes. Together, CPLDs and FPGAs are often referred to as High-Capacity Programmable Logic Devices (HCPLDs). The programming technologies for PLD devices are actually based on the various types of semiconductor memory. As new types of memories have been developed, the same technology has been applied to the creation of new types of PLD devices. The amount of logic resources available is the major distinguishing feature between SPLDs and HCPLDs. Today, SPLDs are devices that typically contain the equivalent of 600 or fewer gates, while HCPLDs have thousands and hundreds of thousands of gates available. Of the two types of HCPLD devices, FPGAs offer the highest amount of logic density, the most features, and the highest performance. FPGAs are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from data processing and storage, to instrumentation, telecommunications, and digital signal processing. CPLDs, by contrast, offer much smaller amounts of logic - up to about 10,000 gates. But CPLDs offer very predictable timing characteristics and are therefore ideal for critical control applications. Some CPLDs require extremely low amounts of power and are very inexpensive, making them ideal for cost-sensitive, battery-operated, portable applications such as mobile phones and digital handheld assistants.

This species in endemic to the southeastern mountain range of the United States. It is mainly found in North Carolina near Grandfather Mountain. These salamanders have a unique metallic spotting which distinguishes them from other Plethodon species and other salamanders in the area. They mainly inhabit cool forests with rocky areas. This species is currently threatened by population fragmentation and habitat degradation/loss.  Description with Diet  Weller's salamander has 16 coastal grooves with light dorsal markings. The markings are usually dark gold in color with a metallic look. These are smaller salamanders, like most plethodontids, and have a slender body. They have 17 trunk vertebrae, which makes them the shortest of the eastern small plethodontids, and two to seven vomerin teeth that are located in series. These salamanders also have webbed toes. Males and females have differing visible genitalia that can be used to tell them apart. Females have a simple slit, while males have a cloacal gland and papillae in the vent. Like other plethodontids, Weller's salamander produces a noxious skin secretion when threatened and sometimes goes immobile when picked up to trick a predator that the individual is already dead. These salamanders are insectivores that feed on insects including pseudoscorpions, orb-weaver spiders, ticks and mites, springtails, true bugs, butterflies and moths, flies, and beetles.  Habitat  This species of plethodon salamander is a high-altitude species found in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains. Their range is the area around northwest North Carolina and includes the parts of Tennessee and Virginia into which the mountains extend. However, these salamanders are restricted to a few counties in the mentioned states. These counties include Johnson and Unicori Counties in Tennessee and Yancey County in North Carolina. The mountains these salamanders inhabit include Mt. Rodgers and the Whitetop Mountains in southwest Virginia, as well as the Unaka Mountain ridges in northeastern Tennessee and eastern North Carolina. These plethodons are found mainly in the highland areas around this mountain ridge. They inhabit spruce and birch forests that are heavily shaded. Some individuals were found in upper-level hardwood forests. The salamanders prefer habitats with cooler temperatures. These salamanders tend to be found under logs, stones, and flat rocks in their preferred habitats.  Reproduction  Weller's salamanders breed during the spring and fall. Courtship behaviors have been observed in captivity in October and April. The females are reproductively mature at 35 mm in length and tend to be older than 3 years when they become mature. The males can breed around 30 mm long at about 2-3 years old. The females lay eggs in clutches of four to 11 eggs in tight clusters suspended by a stalk. These nests are found under moss mats that cover conifer logs. These eggs are seen between mid-August to September and are between 2.6 and 6.5 mm in diameter. The offspring show direct development with little to no evidence of gills being visible once the egg has hatched. Some evidence indicates the females brood or guard the eggs. The females found at these nests were undernourished, which indicates they do not feed during their time guarding the eggs. The eggs laid by the females are dark in color due to being pigmented with melanophores.  Conservation  The larger populations of these salamanders appear to be stable. These are the locations found on Grandfather Mountain and Rodgers Mountain. The populations in North Carolina and Virginia, however, are believed to be declining. The current populations are isolated from each other, causing fragmentation to become a threat to these populations.Pague, C.A. 1991. Amphibians and reptiles. In: Terwilliger, K. (ed.), Virginia's Endangered Species: Proceedings of a Symposium, pp. 411-476. McDonald and Woodward Publishing Company, Blacksburg, Virginia. The high altitude of the habitat helps protect the populations to some degree.Petranka, J.W. 1998. Salamanders of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C. Much of the salamander's range on Mount Rodgers is a national recreation area, and most of the land within the park is protected. The area around Grandfather Mountain is privately owned, but seems to be under stable protection.Braswell, A.L. 1989. Scientific council report on the conservation status of North Carolina amphibians and reptiles. Nongame Wildlife Advisory Committee, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, North Carolina. The populations of these salamanders are very isolated and the small number of individuals in each population makes those populations susceptible to extinction due to catastrophic events such as fires or more habitat degradation. The major threat to this species is habitat degradation and loss, mainly due to development and logging practices. See also *List of endangered animal species References Further reading *Adler, K.

Her purpose was to aid ships, usually by towing, on the high seas or in combat or post-combat areas, plus \\"other duties as assigned.\\" She served in the Pacific Ocean and after successful support of World War II and the Korean War, her crew returned home proudly displaying two battle stars for World War II and four battle stars for their efforts during the Korean War. Lipan was laid down 30 May 1942 by United Engineering Co., San Francisco, California; launched on 17 September 1942; sponsored by Miss Jean Kell; and commissioned on 29 April 1943, Lt. F. W. Beyer in command.  World War II Pacific Theater operations  After shakedown in Puget Sound and San Francisco, California, harbor duty, the new ocean-going tug departed with three lighters for the New Hebrides and arrived Espiritu Santo on 2 October. She towed war equipment and supplies from Espiritu Santo to the new base at Guadalcanal until 20 November. Transferring to Guadalcanal on 6 December, Lipan was redesignated ATF-85 (fleet ocean tug) on 13 April and operated in the Solomons during the first half of 1944.  Supporting the invasion of Saipan  Lipan departed Guadalcanal on 4 June with Rear Admiral Reifsnider's Southern Transport Attack Group for the scheduled assault on Guam. When the invasion of Guam was postponed by the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the ship joined Service Squadron 10 at Eniwetok on 3 July supporting the invasion of Saipan. Departing on 8 July with barge in tow, she arrived at Saipan on 15 July and remained under constant enemy fire until 20 July, then rejoined Admiral Reifsnider's group at Agat Bay, Guam, on D-Day, 21 July. During the two weeks of fierce fighting after D-Day, Lipan rescued landing craft grounded by the treacherous surf ringing Agat Bay. Once the U.S. Marines had gained a foothold, the tug towed supply ships bringing in reinforcements to liberate the island and transform Guam into an advanced base for the Philippine campaign. Supporting Leyte operations  Returning to Eniwetok on 30 September, she sailed for Ulithi with two boats in tow on 12 October, arrived the 20th, and performed ready tow service to aid the ships liberating Leyte. Taking in tandem tow with tug the ship sailed on 14 December for Manus and arrived on 21 December. Dropping the tow, she immediately set course for home and made San Francisco on 9 January 1945.  Supporting Okinawa operations  After overhaul Lipan departed for Okinawa on 24 February dropped fuel barges at Pearl Harbor and Guam, and arrived on 1 May. Three days later, as the Japanese intensified the suicide attacks in a costly but futile campaign to hold Okinawa, the tug undertook salvage and firefighting duties. For two and a half months, as the savage attacks continued, Lipan salvaged and rescued damaged Navy ships off the beaches of Okinawa.  Under attack by kamikaze aircraft  The ship's closest brush with disaster came late afternoon on 21 June. While she was towing the already salvaged to Ie Shima escorted by , two suicide aircraft attacked the convoy. One immediately crashed and sank LSM-59. The second barely missed Lipan and crashed into Barry which sank the next day. The tug made Ie Shima and returned to Okinawa the 25th.  End-of-war operations  With Okinawa nearly secure, the ship departed for overhaul at Leyte on 18 July and arrived on 1 August. Overhaul completed after V-J Day, she departed for a supposedly peaceful run to Okinawa, on 23 September, with two boats in tow.  Damaged in a typhoon  While Lipan was en route on 30 September a typhoon with seas and winds over battered the tug with 55° rolls, snapping the tow, and starting a fire which destroyed the propulsion panel and the lower motor room. After riding out the storm, she made Subic Bay on 7 October. Following extensive repairs, Lipan sailed for San Francisco on 3 December and arrived on Christmas Day.  Post-war activity  During the postwar years, Lipan towed gasoline barges, landing craft, disabled submarines, floating drydocks, and target sleds in operations off the U.S. West Coast and in the western Pacific.  Korean War operations  With the outbreak of the Korean war, Lipan departed Long Beach, California, for the Orient on 20 June 1950. The tug arrived Yokosuka, Japan, on 15 July and shoved off that afternoon to deliver mail and medical supplies to Task force TF 90 in Korean waters. She called at Hoko Ko, Korea (18-24 July) and returned for harbor services at Yokosuka until 5 September. She then steamed with TF 90 for Inchon Harbor for the brilliant flanking amphibious assault. As the landing forces swept ashore and caught the North Koreans completely by surprise, the tug cast off her pontoon tows, and began various towing and salvage assignments. A month later she was relieved at Inchon and steamed for Pusan en route to duty along the east coast of Korea. Arriving Riwon Harbor near Wonsan on 1 November Lipan planted channel buoys, retracted 23 damaged LSTs from the beach, and recovered lost anchors in Wonsan Harbor, then steamed north and laid buoys at Hŭngnam Harbor and Songjin Harbor. Returning to Wonsan on 26 November, she left the next day for Sasebo, Japan, and arrived the 30th. For the next two months the tug towed Army pontoon barges from Inchon to Taechon, Korea, or back to Sasebo. She sailed from Sasebo to Yokohama on 16 February with in tow, and steamed independently for Pearl Harbor the 18th, arriving on 1 March. After a three-month overhaul and towing missions to the Marshall Islands and Subic Bay, she departed Hawaii on 26 November for a six-month tour of duty at Apra Harbor, Guam, then returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 June 1952. For the next eleven months she again operated between Hawaii and the Marshalls. On 2 May 1953 the tug left Pearl Harbor for towing duty between Sasebo and various Korean ports such as Inchon, Pusan, and Wonsan. She returned to Hawaii on 19 November.  Post-Korean War activity  The Lipan was home ported in Pearl Harbor from 1954 to 1973 and San Diego until the ships decommissioning in July 1973. The tug continued to meet the towing and salvage needs of the U.S. Pacific Fleet from the west coast to the western Pacific.  Assigned to the Military Sealift Command  She was assigned to the Military Sealift Command (MSC) 31 July 1973 and placed in service as USNS Lipan (T-ATF-85).  On loan to the Coast Guard  USCGC Lipan (WMEC-85) in Key West Lipan was placed out of service, c. 1980, and transferred on loan to the United States Coast Guard. She was commissioned, USCGC Lipan (WMEC-85) on 30 September 1980 and served the Coast Guard until she was decommissioned, on 31 March 1988 and returned to U.S. Naval custody.  Decommissioning  Lipan was struck from the Naval Register on 23 January 1989 and sunk as a target on 22 January 1990.  Awards  Lipan received two battle stars for World War II service and four battle stars for Korean service.

Berkeley: University of California, 2005. 856-857. Print. Description In the North Carolina mountains P. yonahlossee is a large Southern Appalachian woodland salamander typically differentiated by its large size and its distinctive rust-colored dorsum. As with all other members of the genus, Plethodon yonahlossee is lungless and a direct developer, meaning no larval stage is seen; instead, the young hatch into miniature adults, and fully metamorphosed adult individuals are characterized by a nasolabial groove that aids in chemoreception. The yonahlossee's back has a black base color and is covered by reddish-brown to red blotches depending on age. Typically, juveniles are more spotted, while in older individuals, the reddish blotches come together to form a wide band spanning the length of their backs. The sides of their bodies are covered with grey to white blotching, and the dorsal part of their heads is all black. The belly and throat are both pigmented, but sometimes have a similar blotched pattern as the back.Hammerson, G. 2004. Plethodon yonahlossee. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. Downloaded on 02 June 2013. P. yonahlossee is the largest member of the family Plethodontidae in North America. Females are significantly larger than males. The typical adult length is between 11 and 22 cm. Typically, the yonahlossee has 15 or 16 costal grooves. Distribution P. yonahlossee can be found in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains of northern Tennessee, western North Carolina, and small portions of southwest Virginia. Specifically, they have been located in Avery, Yancey, and Rutherford Counties in North Carolina; Rocky Fork State Park & Limestone Cove in Unicoi County, Tennessee, and Whitetop Mountain, Virginia. They are found in a variety of upland wooded habitats. They tend to be located in deciduous forests at elevations between 437 and 1,737 m, but tend to be more altitudinally restricted compared to other members of Plethodontidae. They are also commonly found in damp, shaded areas around wooded hillsides and ravines, where rock slides are covered with mosses and ferns; areas with old windfalls; and grassy areas near woodlands. A unique population only found in Rutherford County, North Carolina, occurs near Bat Cave and is often found in rock crevices, but is sometimes recognized as a separate species characterized by different coloration and limb morphology, P. longicrus. These Bat Cave variants may have red of the dorsum prominent, patchy, or even lacking, and their sides are dark with light spots. The coloration of the Bat Cave variant is much darker than the common P. yonahlossee, and some scientists still consider them to be a separate species. Furthermore, the variant does not reach sexual maturity like P. yonahlossee, but matures according to size. Males must reach greater than 65 mm and females must be greater than 61 mm before being considered mature.Bartlett, Richard D., and Patricia Pope Bartlett. Guide and Reference to the Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America (north of Mexico). Gainesville: University of Florida, 2006. 218-219. Print. During the day, it takes cover under rotting logs, rocks, or in burrows on the forest floor which are under logs, although it is argued whether or not they create these burrows or just reopen partly eradicated passages. They prefer areas of old windfalls that have shed most of their bark and logs greater than 25 cm in diameter with no more than 5 to 15 cm of the log below the surface and a thick layer of leaf litter at the interface between the log and the ground. They can also be found active on humid or rainy nights, even crossing roads in suitable habitat.Pough, F. Harvey. Herpetology. 3rd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2004. Print. Behavior and ecology Little is known about the reproductive habits of this species. Reproduction does take place terrestrially and eggs are deposited in underground cavities where, like other members of the genus, the female may guard the eggs until they hatch.Martof, Bernard S. Amphibians and Reptiles of the Carolinas and Virginia. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1980. 99. Print. Spermatogenesis most likely occurs after the emergence from hibernation. Courtship is assumed to occur in early August, as this is the time pairs of salamanders have been found under a single cover object and males have noticeably enlarged mental glands. Females then lay their eggs in late August or early September. Clutch size is dependent on the size of the female, but typically ranges from 19 to 27. Sexual maturity is thought to be around three years of age. Also, a definitive feature of maturity is the length of the mental glands which in males is about 56 mm, whereas in females it is more like 60 to 66 mm, depending again on the size of the female. Both adults and juveniles emerge at night to forage. Juveniles have been found to be most active one hour after sunset, while adults peak one to two hours later. Each stage is carnivorous and eats small insects and invertebrates, including mites, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, and earthworms. Predators likely include snakes, birds, and small mammals. To escape predation, P. yonahlossee produces secretions from its tail that are noxious to birds and other mammals. Also, after initial contact, they become immobile, making them harder to detect, which may increase survival from visual predators. In laboratory settings, Yonahlossee salamanders demonstrated aggressive defense of their territories. Like most species in the genus, they exhibit vertical underground migration and move underground during cold winter. Conservation As of 2014, P. yonahlossee is listed as a least concern species. Criteria for this listing include occurrence in an area of extensive, suitable habitat which appears to not be under any substantial threat, an assumed large population, and a slow rate of decline.2001 Categories & Criteria (version 3.1). IUCN. P. yonahlossee among other terrestrial salamanders has been reported to have no change in abundance in single or several locales over many years. Concurrently, others are viewing the same species over the entire range and are reporting that many populations have been lost to habitat destruction, which includes urban sprawl and increased forestry practices. Clearly, a possibility exists for one species to be locally abundant with stable populations, yet still be declining throughout the range. Salamander habitat loss is mainly due to outright destruction, fragmentation, forestry practice, and pollution.Semlitsch, Raymond D. Amphibian Conservation.

It is endemic to Oaxaca, Mexico and only known from its type locality near Peña Verde, which is the northernmost high peak in the Sierra de Juárez. Description Two males in the type series measured about in snout–vent length and eight females in snout–vent length. The habitus is relatively robust. The head is relatively broad. The snout is broadly rounded but more truncate in males than in females. The limbs are relatively long, with well-developed hands and feet with comparatively long and slender digits. The dorsal ground color is reddish brown, grading to pale yellow ventrally. There is a broad and conspicuous orange mid-dorsal stripe that runs from the scapular region to the tip of the tail; in the head region, this dorsal stripe is broken into darker flecks. There are bright yellow spots all over the dorsum but they are more concentrated on the tail. The underside of the body and tail is uniform pale yellow, without spots. Habitat and conservation Pseudoeurycea aurantia occur in pine cloud forests and in barren open lands at higher altitudes; the altitudinal range is above sea level. It has been found under rocks, the bark of logs, and in or under decaying wood. Reproduction is through direct development; one female was found guarding a clutch of 22 eggs under the bark of a log. The species is extremely common within its small range. However, there are threats to its habitat from forest fires, timber extraction, and small-scale farming, which keeps moving uphill. The IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group underscores that habitat protection is urgently required for this species.

Electrical power systems CAD tools are used by electrical power systems engineers. In the United States alone, power systems are a $100 billion industry.National Electrical Contractors Association Power systems CAD tools increase the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of electrical systems designers Electrical Contractor magazineConsulting-Specifying Engineer magazine by providing a design foundation that allows power systems to be created quickly and by enabling design engineers to test the safety and integrity of their design concepts. Power systems CAD software products allow organizations to develop power systems designs, with faster turnaround time, than with previous manual methods. Aids to electrical calculation started with DC network calculating boards and AC network analyzers, which reached a high degree of development by the middle of the 20th century. Large scale digital computers became powerful enough to overtake the previous analog model systems. The use of personal computers with graphical displays lead to development of integrated suites of power systems design software, which allowed several different power system studies to be carried out on the same input model data.  CAD overview The electrical power systems CAD process, frequently called power systems \\"modeling,\\" typically consists of two distinct stages: * The design stage, in which an electric systems model is created, and * The simulation or analysis stage, in which software simulation programs are used to test the integrity of the design; these simulation programs test how the model would behave in real- world operation by checking for specific types of design or operational problems (see list below.) Design is an iterative process, in which simulation results will suggest ways that the design should be modified to increase safety, reliability, and serviceability. At the conclusion of the design effort, organizations will enjoy a far higher degree of confidence in the integrity of their power systems infrastructure than with manually drawn schematics. The same model used for computer-aided design of a power system can be used as the bass for real-time monitoring and modeling of the system, giving network operators a quantitative value for any proposed changes in system operating conditions. Calculations and simulations  Several electrical engineering calculations and tests can be performed on a power systems CAD model, including: * Short circuit analysis * AC and DC Arc flash * Protective device coordination * Power flow study * Cable pulling * Power system reliability * Electromagnetic transient analysis * cable ampacity * Induction motor parameter estimation * Transmission line parameters * Power system optimization * Electrical substation grounding grid design * Motor starting * Voltage stability and contingency analysis.

It is endemic to Mexico and occurs mostly along the western and southern margins of the Mexican Plateau, with isolated populations elsewhere.  Habitat  Its natural habitats are pine and pine-oak forests at high elevation, as well as forest edges and grazed areas. It tolerates habitat modification and is also found in degraded forests, coffee plantations, rural gardens, and close to urbanized and highly disturbed areas. This terrestrial species is typically found beneath logs, rocks, waste timber, brush piles, and within leaf litter. Once common, this species has disappeared from many places.

It was an experiment in building close-knit communities as a way of helping vulnerable single people. It became the subject of significant controversy when it was demolished to make way for the site of the London 2012 Olympic games.Olympic Disagreement over Evictions The Guardian, 18 June 2007 Creation and organisation The 1982 Clays Lane Community Centre, shown in 2007 shortly before demolition Clays Lane Housing Co-operative was a fully mutual housing co-operative, established to address the lack of housing for vulnerable single people in the east of London. It was initially funded by organisations including Newham London Borough Council and the University of East London. There were up to 500 contractual tenants at the beginning, 450 after the flats were voted eligible for single person occupancy, who had to be single people aged between 18 and 59. Tenants were required to purchase a £1 share in order to become a member of the co-operative, which entitled them to attend and vote in the annual general meeting, to elect or stand for the management committee, participate in the co-operative’s affairs and receive its services. Inclusive architecture & design The Clays Lane estate consisted of an enclave of 57 shared houses in red or yellow brick (containing four, six or ten bedrooms) and 40 self-contained flats and 10 self-contained bungalows, all purpose built in 1977. The estate was set on a small artificial hill, to provide views, protect the estate from flooding, and (potentially) shield it from hazards of waste dumped underneath. A community centre (complete with shop, café, function hall, and training room), which also housed the housing office, was added in 1982. All of the co-operative's properties were located on one site in the London Borough of Newham, on the top of a small hill next to the Eastway Cycle Circuit (which had previously been the site of an old landfill site, the West Ham Tip). This provided views across Hackney Marshes and the Lee Valley. The estate was designed to engender a strong local community, and was frequently used to help people make re-entry into social life - its motto was \\"A community - not just a housing estate\\". The housing was arranged in ten courtyards, each of which held a monthly meeting to discuss issues that may have arisen, hear back from committee representatives (each courtyard elected a member to the management committee), find out the latest news and generally catch up with each other. The estate also had its own sports teams and program of activities and training. Loss of Cooperative status The Housing Corporation instigated a standard (statutory) inquiry into the affairs of the Clays Lane Co-operative in 2000, and subsequently received a report of poor management of the Co-operative's affairs from the Audit Commission.The report was the result of an Audit Commission Inspection and which resulted in the Co-op receiving a judgement of zero stars and poor prospects for improvement. Clays Lane Housing Cooperative Report by the Audit Commission, 8 February 2005 Under the Audit Commission inspection regime, this was the minimum, base, and worst possible, result for any housing provider. One of the report's most worrying findings was that the Co-op had no written Allocations Policy, which meant that it was not clear how people secured a place there or who was actually living there. It proposed that the Co-operative’s housing stock be transferred to the Peabody Trust, one of the UK’s largest housing associations, because of its better financial security, and the Government approved the transfer. The Clays Lane Co- operative appealed against the order, because as the Peabody Trust was not a co-operative they would lose their mutual status if the transfer were to go ahead. They proposed an alternative, whereby the homes be transferred to Tenants First, a mutual housing co-operative based in Scotland. The Housing Corporation rejected this alternative and again directed transfer to the Peabody Trust. The cooperative called for a judicial review of the decision, but this was refused, with the court ruling in June 2003 that the housing should be sold to the Peabody Trust.Human Rights & Public Law Update Summary of legal caseUnison - Clays Lane report on the ruling of transfer to the Peabody Trust In August 2005 the estate was statutorily transferred to the Peabody Trust, and was subsequently managed by Waltham Forest Community Based Housing Association.Clays Lane stock to transfer to Peabody UK Housing archive Impact of London 2012 Olympics A block of flats on the estate in January 2007, showing several flats that had been 'boarded up' inside the widow panes (sometimes with curtains left in place) in an attempt to preserve the appearance of the community for the remaining residents, as the estate was prepared for demolition The entire estate was the subject of a compulsory purchase order by the London Development Agency to make way for the athletes' village in the 2012 London Olympics site: indeed almost all the inhabitants cleared from the Olympic site were students at the adjacent UEL halls of residence or Clays Lane residents.Acquisition of the Clays Lane housing Waltham Forest Community Based Housing Association report, 2005 Many residents were extremely vocal in their opposition of the compulsory purchase order, and several protests were held in nearby Stratford.Displaced by London's Olympics - The Guardian newspaper - article by Charlotte Baxter, 2 June 2008 A group of tenants gained leave to hold a public inquiry into the decision to compulsorily purchase the estate, which was held in August 2006. This was, however, dismissed in a High Court ruling on 30 May 2007. All 430 residents of the Clay’s Lane Housing Cooperative were issued with orders to leave by July 2007. Residents were promised equivalent, if not better, housing (as well as £8,500 for the loss of their homes and relocation expenses). However it was reported that early movers found this was not the case, and some feared that dispersal to sites across East London would mean the end of the unusually close community links in the estate. Surveys after the evictions found that residents particularly missed the communal areas, facilities and social life of the Clays Lane Estate, and often found their new accommodation anonymous.The London Olympics and Urban Development: The Mega-Event City, edited by Gavin Poynter, Valierie Viehoff and Yang Li, pub. Regional Studies Association, Routledge, p.228 There was further controversy when 11 'short life' tenants in the Peabody Nags Head estate were evicted to make way for residents displaced from Clays Lane.Tenants make way for Clays Lane evictees Inside Housing, 18 August 2006, Updated 10 June 2008 Demolition Demolition of the estate, and of the small artificial hill that it sat on, began in September 2007. A report in The Guardian newspaper referred to several documents and surveys suggesting that Thorium isotope had been dumped on the site in 1959, and that a radiological survey of the area carried out by WS Atkins in 1993 had revealed \\"the presence of elevated levels of [radiation] activity above the general background level for that area\\". The Guardian report also referred to an internal memorandum written by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority valuer and estates surveyor in 1972, that recommended that the ground over the waste should not be disturbed without further tests. Estate residents, concerned that dangerous materials might be extracted, had unsuccessfully tried to secure a court injunction to stop ground tests being carried out before they were rehoused.Residents' fears of radioactive waste on site of Olympic village -The Guardian Newspaper, Ian Griffiths, 26 January 2007 No trace now remains of the estate, however the Museum of London holds a photographic record of the Clays Lane Estate and the adjacent travellers site, part of a project to document the site prior to its demolition.Clays Lane Estate and Travellers' site, Temple Mills Museum of London Collection Contemporary housing cooperatives Although the housing cooperative model never developed extensively in London, a few other cooperative housing projects were trialled at around the same time as Clays Lane, with similar aims and organisational structures. A comparable (but smaller) housing co- operative with 40 flats and 20 shared houses was created south side of the river Thames at the Thamesmead Housing Co-operative, however it was dissolved in the 1990s.

It was loosely based on the popular Haunted Mansion attraction and includes vocal appearances by Disney Villains. It was replaced by Disney's Not So Spooky Spectacular!. History During the first few years of the Halloween Party, the evening's fireworks show was the original Fantasy in the Sky show, with the addition of a Halloween-themed finale. HalloWishes was created by Disney's Creative Entertainment division specifically for the event, first premiering in 2005 and before the show starts there was a fireworks show named villainy in the sky with new effects and projection. Its development was supervised by Steven Davison and designer Eric Tucker, who also designed Wishes, Holiday Wishes, Remember... and IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. The music has a predominantly electronic/rock/pop instrumentation with much symphonic arrangements, and was arranged by Mark Hammond and David Hamilton. The vocals were arranged by Tim Davis, who would then go on to work with Adam Anders and Jimmy Levine in the arrangements of the songs and underscore for Glee. On April 26, 2019, it was announced that a new fireworks show would be replacing Happy HalloWishes starting with 2019's Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. On July 17, the title was announced as Disney's Not-So-Spooky Spectacular. Plot summary The premise of HalloWishes is that the residents of the Haunted Mansion, led by the mansion's \\"Ghost Host,\\" are preparing for a celebration of Halloween. The 999 happy haunts, called by Madame Leota, are the first to arrive as the opening lines of \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" are played, followed by a pop band version. After the Ghost Host welcomes guests, the mood is set with \\"This is Halloween\\" from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Then the guests are serenaded with the spirits' special brand of karaoke (which the script calls \\"scary-oke music; just a few tombs [tunes] we've 'dug up' for the occasion\\") in a medley of Disney's spookiest music. Later, some of Disney's most infamous villains join in, starting with Ursula from The Little Mermaid \\"plopping in\\" on the party and adding her own musical mix to the festivities. Jafar from Aladdin and Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas soon follow, and (until 2008) arriving last but far from the least is Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty, showing us how Halloween should really be celebrated. The party ends with the \\"scream-along\\" grand finale.

It is endemic to the west-central Veracruz, Mexico, and known from Acultzingo (its type locality) on the Puebla–Veracruz border eastward to the Sierra Zongolica. It is also known as the Firschein's false brook salamander or simply Firschein's salamander. The specific name firscheini honors Mr. Irwin Lester Firschein, an American biologist, geneticists, and anthropologist. The authors acknowledge Firschein for his explorations on Volcan San Martin, said to \\"have done much toward stimulating interest in this region of Mexico\\". Description Pseudoeurycea firscheini was described based on four specimens of unspecified sex, including the holotype measuring in snout–vent length and a juvenile measuring in snout–vent length and in total length. The adults have small, lichen-like light spots on the tail. The sides and the underparts of the body are almost black. The hind legs are relatively large. The fingers are less than half-webbed, whereas the slender toes are about one-third webbed. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats are pine-oak forests and lower cloud forests at elevations of above sea level. The type series was collected in water-filled bromeliads growing on trees at heights of above ground, and it appears to require the presence of abundant bromeliads growing on mature trees in its habitat. The dependence of Pseudoeurycea firscheini on large bromeliad-covered trees makes it susceptible to habitat loss caused by expanding agriculture and human settlements and by wood extraction. The species might be present in the , but this has yet to be confirmed. Mexican law protects it under the \\"Special Protection\\" category.

University Hall as it appeared in 1877. University Hall is the oldest original building on the Northwestern University campus in Evanston, Illinois, and the second building to have been constructed after Old College, which stood on campus until the 1970s. The building has served a wide range of different roles since its construction, and currently houses the university's English department. History University Hall was designed in Victorian Gothic style by Gurdon P. Randall, and is composed of Joliet limestone - the same kind used to build the Chicago Water Tower. The construction materials were transported to the Evanston campus by lake boat and rail. The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1868, and the structure was completed in 1869, at a total cost of $125,000. University Hall officially opened on September 8, 1869 and coincided with the inauguration of University President Erastus Otis Haven. Speakers at the opening ceremony included Illinois Governor John M. Palmer, and the new University President Haven, who called the structure, \\"the new and elegant University Building\\". The clock in the tower of University Hall was the gift of the Class of 1879; its movement was built by clockmaker Seth Thomas. In 1966, a new electrified clock replaced the old works, which are now located in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.. Upon its completion, University Hall took over most university functions from Old College. University Hall originally contained classrooms housing all Northwestern University classes, the main campus library, a chemical lab, a chapel, two society rooms and a fourth-floor natural history museum. University Hall contained Northwestern's primary library until the construction of Lunt Library (now known as Lunt Hall) in the 1890s. Lunt Library was the first dedicated library building built on the campus of Northwestern University. Though University Hall was succeeded by Fayerweather Hall as the university's main building in 1887, throughout its history, University Hall served a variety of functions. Over the years University Hall has been the home of the central administration, the engineering school, a cafeteria, and faculty offices.Northwestern University Archives University Hall underwent a $5.2 million renovation and was rededicated in 1993. The building is currently home to Northwestern's English department.

In 1992, he was defeated for renomination by Doris Allen after they were redistricted into the same district. Legislative career Dr Frizzelle's political activity began in 1954 in Pasadena, California, where he led a movement to challenge the Pasadena public school decision to stop enforcing correct spelling in grammar school. That challenge culminated in the removal of the superintendent. After a move to Orange County in 1955, Dr Frizzelle became active in the Christian Anticommunism Crusade and built a network of conservative contacts in the area. Based on that network he was elected President of the unofficial California Republican Assembly (CRA) and used the influence of that organization to help the conservative Barry Goldwater win the Republican presidential nomination over the liberal candidate Nelson Rockefeller, at the Republican Convention in San Francisco in 1964. A cohort in the Goldwater campaign was the political columnist Ronald Reagan. In 1964, when conservative Republicans needed a candidate to challenge the incumbent California Gov. Pat Brown (D), Dr. Frizzelle helped convince Reagan to run by providing the first organizational endorsement of Reagan's campaign, from the CRA. Reagan originally asked Dr Frizzelle to run as his candidate for Lt Gov, but later reconsidered and recruited the more moderate Bob Finch for the role. Reagan outdistanced other Republican candidates for Governor, including Joe Shell from southern California and Warren Christopher from San Francisco, and ultimately won the 1966 general election as Governor of California. Dr Frizzelle was President of the Rotary Club of Newport and a member of the Newport-Mesa School District Board before running unsuccessfully for California Assembly in 1978. In 1980, Frizzelle ran again and defeated three-term Democratic Assemblyman Dennis Mangers, who had been elected as part of the Democratic wave following the Watergate scandal in 1974. Dr Frizzelle represented Orange County's 73rd District, which became the 69th District after the 1980 redistricting. Frizzelle served in the Assembly until 1992. While in the Assembly he authored several bills to permit toll roads as part of the state's freeway system. 1991 State Senate Special Election He lost a special election primary to succeed John Seymour in the California State Senate after Seymour had been appointed to the US Senate by Gov. Pete Wilson. Frizzelle received 17.8% of the vote. 1992 Primary Frizzelle was defeated for renomination 1992. He faced Tom Mays and Doris Allen, both fellow assembly members redistricted into the new 67th district. Allen received 41% of the vote, Mays received 39% of the vote while Frizzelle received just 20% of the vote. Personal Frizzelle was born in Los Angeles, California and graduated from Beverly Hills High School. He left Stanford University to become a Marine officer in World War II. He later graduated from UCLA and from the USC College of Optometry in 1949. He and his father Charles practiced optometry together in Los Angeles, until Nolan began his own practice in Newport Beach in 1959. Nolan and his wife Mary met at UCLA, raised four children and divorced when the last left for college. Four years later Nolan married Ina Evans and they raised her two children together. He had homes in Huntington Beach and in Folsom, California, where he died, aged 91.

These species are restricted to the upper Salween (Nujiang River) and one upper branch of the Irrawaddy (Dayinjiang River) in China. P. brachysoma is known only from the middle and lower Nujiang River. P. yunnanensis is only known from the upper Dayinjiang. These rivers were once connected, but are now separated. Also, the environment and temperature of the Nujiang River became greatly different between the northern and southern areas, leading to speciation. Taxonomy Glyptosternum yunnanesis was first described in 1935. However, due to its unique teeth, a separate genus Pseudexostoma was erected in 1979 for this species. The same year, a subspecies of P. yunnanensis was described, P. y. brachysoma. However, it has become apparent that these two groups represent different species. Also, a third species, P. longipterus, was described in 2007.Zhou, W., Yang, Y., Li, X. & Li, M.-H.

Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, 55 (1): 147-155. Results obteined by Yang et al., 2016 showed that P. longipterus cannot be distinguished from P. brachysoma from either morphological or molecular analyses and that the former name should thus be considered a junior synonym of the latter.Yang, K., Jiang, W., Chen, X., Zhou, W. & Yang, J. (2016): An integrative approach to reappraising species validity in Pseudexostoma (Teleostei: Sisoridae). Zootaxa, 4158 (3): 352–366. Species There are currently 2 recognized species in this genus: * Pseudexostoma brachysoma X. L. Chu, 1979 * Pseudexostoma yunnanensis (T. L. Tchang, 1935) Description These species have a continuous groove behind the lip, gill openings not extending onto the underside, heterodont dentition in both jaws with outer teeth shovel-shaped and sparsely arranged in one or two rows and inner teeth conical and numerous, the tooth patches separated in upper jaw, and 16-18 branched pectoral rays.Thomson, A.W. & Page, L.M. (2006): Genera of the Asian Catfish Families Sisoridae and Erethistidae (Teleostei: Siluriformes). Zootaxa, 1345: 1–96. The lips are thick, fleshy and papillated. The paired fin are plaited to form an adhesive apparatus. Species of this genus have a moderately compressed body. The head is depressed and broad; it appears triangular from the side and with a rounded snout from above. The eyes are small and ovoid, located at the middle of the dorsal surface of the head. The mouth is transverse and inferior, with the teeth exposed when the mouth is closed. The teeth are embedded in the skin, shovel-shaped, with the tips exposed and arranged in irregular rows. The gill openings are narrow. The dorsal surface is smooth without tubercles. There are four pairs of barbels. The adipose fin base is not connected to the caudal fin. The caudal fin is emarginate with the upper lobe smaller than the lower lobe. The lateral line is midlateral and complete. Species of this genus are grey black on the dorsal surface and grey yellow on the ventral region; the caudal fin is grey black with an irregular, small, yellow patch in the middle and the other fins are grey yellow along the distal edge. Pseudexostoma grow to about SL. These species have three notches on the posterior margin of the lower lip. However, in P. yunnanensis, the notches are all the same depth, while in the other two species the middle notch is shallower in depth than the lateral notches. The two median lobes formed by these notches are the same length of the lateral lobes of the lips in P. yunnanensis, but they are longer in the other two species. P. yunnanensis also has more pelvic fin rays (5 vs. 3-4), a shorter adipose fin base, a deeper and longer caudal peduncle, more teeth in the premaxillary tooth band (18-22 vs. 16-18) that are divided into two partially connected patches instead of two isolated patches.

Description The cyrtoconoid (= approaching a conical shape but with convex sides) shell is usually perforate or umbilicate. The spire is moderately elevated. The whorls are often gibbous or tuberculose beneath the sutures, smooth or spirally ribbed. The last whorl is generally angular at the periphery. The aperture is subrhomboidal. The columella is oblique, dentate or subsinuous at the base. The outer lip is acute. The central tooth and the lateral teeth of the radula have well- developed denticulate cusps.

The now mostly vanished and completely buried Timpanogos Glacier left behind a terminal moraine which now impounds the lake. The runoff from the rock glacier feeds the lake and colors it blue. The lake is accessible by hiking, the Mount Timpanogos Trail (also known as the Aspen Grove Trail) from Aspen Grove being the fastest way to reach it. The lake is from the trailhead, or about two-thirds of the way up to the summit.

It is endemic to Mexico and only known from the area of its type locality near Ayutla, Oaxaca. Its common name is mustache false brook salamander or mustached false brook salamander. The specific name refers to the whitish protuberances on the lips that resemble a mustache in the frontal view of the male holotype. Description The type series consists of two specimens, the male holotype measuring and the female allotype in snout–vent length. The tail is shorter than the body, with total lengths of about for the two specimens, respectively. The limbs are moderately short and stout. The dorsum is gray in its ground color with faint traces of pink especially on the snout, and with scattered black dots. The tail has some conspicuous, large white blotches. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitat are pine-oak and Arbutus forests at elevations of about above sea level. The short and stout limbs of this species suggest that it is terrestrial rather than a climber. The type locality is a ravine, although the species does not seem to be particularly associated with rivers. It tolerates some habitat disturbance as some small subpopulations survive in tiny fragments of remaining habitat. Habitat loss caused by agriculture, logging, and human settlement is a major threat for this species as only small fragments of original habitat remain. This uncommon species was last been seen in 1999. However, it might be that the species is not quite as uncommon as believed, as local people report having seen salamanders that could be either Pseudoeurycea mystax or Pseudoeurycea cochranae.

It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in central Veracruz, Mexico, where it is known from between Cofre de Perote and Cerro Volcancillo, a satellite peak of Cofre de Perote. Etymology The specific name naucampatepetl is Nahuatl name for Cofre de Perote. Description Adult males measure and females up to in snout–vent length (SVL). The tail is slender and shorter than SVL; it tapers gradually but has a blunt tip. The body is moderately robust. The head is prominent and the eyes are large and relatively protuberant. The snout is large and broadly rounded. The limbs are long and robust. The digits are well developed, and there is no appreciable webbing. The coloration is striking, with solid black background color and with bright pink to pinkish-cream dorsal spots: there is a pair of rounded spots on the back of the head, about the size of the eyeball in diameter, a small mid-dorsal spot in the neck, and a pair of large spots at the level of the forelimbs. These larger spots are followed by 11 pairs of small spots. Finally,there is a conspicuous U-shaped mark behind the hips, pointing backward. The venter is pale gray to dark gray. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitat is pine-oak forest at elevations of above sea level, with plenty of bunch grass. All specimens in the type series were found on roadside banks, under a surface layer of moist soil with a somewhat dry outer crust. This species is known from only six specimens. As of 2016, more than 30 years had passed since it was last seen, despite several surveys, the latest one in 2014.

Born in New Perth, Prince Edward Island, the son of Peter Robertson and Annie McFarlane, Robertson was educated at McGill University where he graduated with honours in 1865, after which he located in Montague, Prince Edward Island where he has worked up a large practice. In 1870, he was acclaimed to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island for 4th Kings. He was re-elected in 1876 but was defeated in 1879. He was re- elected in 1882. He was a Minister Without Portfolio in the cabinet of Robert Poore Haythorne and Louis Henry Davies. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for King's County in the 1882 election. Unseating In 1883, he was declared not duly elected on the grounds that he was a member of the Prince Edward Island Legislative Assembly at the time of the election, in defiance of the law banning dual mandates. Shortly after winning his federal seat, he had submitted his resignation notice from the provincial legislature to two fellow MLAs, Malcolm McFadyen and Peter McLaren, in accordance with the process for resigning from the legislature, and the legislature had already held a by-election to replace him.Journals of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada, Volume 17. MacLean, Roger & Co., 1883. However, a procedural error by McFadyen and McLaren had left the resignation not properly registered, thus leaving his provincial office technically double-seated and his eligibility for federal office in doubt. While several Canadian provinces did at the time allow people to simultaneously hold seats in both the provincial and federal legislatures, Prince Edward Island had enacted a law explicitly disallowing this. The federal committee adjudicating the matter was dominated by the governing Conservative Party, whereas Robertson was a Liberal. The committee ruled that his resignation from the provincial legislature was not valid, and voted to unseat Robertson; rather than holding a by-election, the committee directly awarded the seat to Augustine Macdonald, the Conservative candidate whom Robertson had defeated in the federal election.

Course Rising at Hogeston Hill, near Manorbier Newton, the river meanders through Lamphey and flows past Pembroke Castle to its confluence with Milford Haven Waterway at Pennar Mouth. Pembroke Castle and Castle Pond When the river reaches the town of Pembroke, there are three pools, the first of which is Mill Pond, then downstream is Middle Mill Pond, followed by Castle Pond below the castle. The river is navigable to small craft from Pennar to Mill Pond, but is normally closed at Castle Pond. A rally is held once a year to allow small craft into Castle Pond, and since 1994 an annual canoe race has been held in the river. History An Elizabethan map of 1578 does not name the river, but does note Pennar Mouth. In 1804, The Cambrian reproduced text from Campbell' Political Survey of Britain, quoting A dockyard was built soon afterwards, not on the Pembroke River, but on the River Cleddau just to the north, which became Pembroke Dockyard, developing into the town of Pembroke Dock. Writing in 1810, Richard Fenton notes that there is a Pembroke Ferry, although he does not name the river, which may have been across the Cleddau. The River Pembroke, though, was clearly still an important waterway, as Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of 1833 describes: Lewis also refers to the river as \\"a branch of Milford Harbour (which) terminates at the town\\". Further, it says: In February 1889 the river was the scene of a tragedy when the Bentlass ferry boat capsized and sank, drowning all 16 passengers and crew.

It is endemic to the Sierra Madre Oriental in Veracruz, Mexico. Its natural habitat is lowland tropical moist forest where it is threatened by habitat loss. Description Aquiloeurycea praecellens is a stocky, ground dwelling species that may reach a total length of , almost half of which is tail. It has short, strong limbs and partially webbed fingers and toes. The general colour is brownish black and there are whitish spots along the sides and on the tail. The underside is paler brown. There is some doubt as to the validity of this species as it is only known from a single specimen (holotype) found in 1940. It was an immature specimen so its full size when mature is not known. However, it is likely that it is the smallest species of false brook salamander. The eggs probably hatch directly into small salamanders. Distribution Aquiloeurycea praecellens is known from humid tropical forest on the Atlantic side of the Sierra Madre Oriental near Cordoba in Veracruz State in Mexico. Another sighting was made in a canyon at Teocelo near Jalapa, but this may not have been the same species. Conservation Aquiloeurycea praecellens is listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Critically Endangered. This is because only a single individual has ever been recorded (in 1940) and it was found not far from the city of Cordoba, which has expanded considerably since that date. It is unlikely that any suitable habitat survives.

More specifically, an agent study is used to detect whether or not a substance can prevent or inhibit cancer.glossary In a clinical trial, researchers perform multiple studies in order to test the potential of new cancer drugs. An agent study helps determine the potential of a substance to inhibit cancer, before more studies are done in order to further knowledge of this potential. Cytotoxic vs. Cytostatic Agents Agent studies are used to determine whether a substance exhibits cytotoxicity or cytostasis. A cytotoxic agent will shrink a tumor, while, a cytostatic agent slows or stops tumor growth and metastases. It is important to determine which of these effects an agent poses so that a proper clinical trial can be designed. For example, a study with a cytotoxic agent will look for tumor shrinkage vs. dose. It is much harder to develop a clinical trial for a cytostatic agent. Phase I Clinical Trials Phase I trials are used to determine the maximum tolerated dose of an agent. This dose is then used in the Phase II trials. Maximum tolerated dose is based on the measured toxicity in cytotoxic agents. Cytostatic agents have been demonstrated to show biologic effects while also being nontoxic.

It is endemic to certain mountainous regions of Mexico. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. Description Smith's false brook salamander is a large species that can grow to , half of which is tail. It has a wide head and large paratoid glands behind the eyes. There are twelve to fifteen costal grooves on either side of the body and the tail is prehensile and has a constriction at its base. The limbs are slender and the fingers and toes completely or partially webbed. The back is dark brown, the sides olive brown with black bars and the belly pale. The chin is cream coloured with brown speckles and the sides of the tail have black spots. Distribution and habitat Pseudoeurycea smithi occurs in several mountain ranges in north west Oaxaca State, Mexico, at an altitude of between above sea level. Its natural habitat is pine forests and it is often found hidden under loose bark on fallen logs. In the past it has demonstrated that it can adapt to living in secondary forest after destruction of the virgin forest. Biology Smith's false brook salamander is a terrestrial species. Little is known of the breeding habits of this species but the female is believed to brood the eggs and they hatch directly into juvenile salamanders with no intervening larval stage. Status The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists this species as \\"Critically Endangered\\". At one time it was very common within its range but had declined in numbers by more than eighty percent by 2004. Although logging, changing agricultural practices and human activities have taken place in the mountains where it lives, good quality habitat still exists and these factors do not fully explain the decline in population size, the cause of which remains a mystery. Some of the range is within the bounds of the Parque Nacional Benito Juarez which makes conservation easier. Research is needed to discover the causes of the population collapse.

Crabbe Mountain was originally serviced by rope tow, powered by an old truck engine. Through the years Crabbe has seen the addition of 2 T -bar lifts, and several versions of a rope tow. In 1987 a high speed quad was installed on the mountain, and increased lift capacity and speed greatly. Terrain Park Check out the Crabbe Mountain website for info: http://www.crabbemountain.com/mountain/terrain_park/ Race Club Crabbe Mountain also has a very successful race club, it does extremely well in the atlantic circuit and has also won a few major competitions including a gold in Super G the Canadian nationals.  Summer  With the addition of downhill mountain biking trails in 2006 Crabbe began to expand its operations into the summertime. Crabbe Mountain currently has 6 downhill mountain bike trails, serviced by a shuttle on select nights during the biking season. Many events such as a downhill mountain bike race, enduro bike race, and dirt bike hare scramble have taken place in the summer months since the trails have been built. History Crabbe Mountain is named after the first known owner of much of the property of Crabbe Mountain. Lemuel Jenkins Crabbe lived and worked in the area for most of his life from1799 to 1865. He lived on the property that is directly below the Crabbe parking lot and is buried in a small, out of the way cemetery on the property. Many of his descendants still live locally and some work at Crabbe Mountain. Crabbe Mountain Winter Park Ltd. was incorporated on Dec.13th.,1961. The new facilities consist of a rope tow, three trails, tarpaper warming hut, ski school and a small number of shareholders. In its first year, Crabbe Mountain Winter Park Ltd. had a recorded income of $15.50. In January 2013, a ski instructor was killed when he collided with a skier at the bottom of a hill. In 2015, The Wilson family sells Crabbe Mountain to a group of new local owners, who have a shared passion for the mountain. These new owners, as well as passionate members of the Crabbe community form a Board of Directors who oversee the direction and operations of the resort.

It is found in streams, seeps and swamps and underneath logs, rocks and leaves. It is endemic to the eastern half of the United States with one isolated population in central Mississippi. Mud salamanders have short stocky bodies ranging from 7.5 to 16 cm long. Body color ranges with age and locality with coastal mud salamanders being more dark and drab whilst inland mud salamanders are brighter and have more contrast against the black polka dots that sporadically pattern their bodies. In the earlier years of a mud salamanders life, they tend to have crimson colored body and unspotted stomachs, as they age the salamander becomes a dark red almost purple color and acquires a spotted stomach. mud salamanders have 16 to 17 costal grooves found along the sides of the salamanders body. These salamanders are ectothermic meaning that they cannot control their body temperature and it fluctuates with the temperature. The mud salamander is readily confused with two other species, the red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber) and the spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). It can be distinguished from the Red salamander by having golden pupils and a shorter snout, and can be distinguished from the spring salamander by having a shorter body length and missing the nasal ridge associated with this species. There are four subspecies in the mud salamander complex, these are the Gulf Coast mud salamander, rusty mud salamander, Midland mud salamander and the eastern mud salamander. Taxonomy The taxonomy of Pseudotriton montanus and its closest relatives is unsettled. Several subspecies have been described, and some of these might warrant full species rank. In particular, Pseudotriton diastictus maybe treated as a species or a subspecies (Pseudotriton montanus diastictus). The rest of this article is following the latter position. Description The mud salamander is known for its reddish-brown color, brown eyes, stocky girth, and short tail. It also has between 30 and 40 distinct round black spots on its back by the time it reaches adulthood. Younger mud salamanders are typically colored bright red, orangish-brown, or crimson, with unmarked stomachs and separated spots, while older mud salamanders’ colors darken with age and take on more of a brown coloring. They also acquire more spots, larger spots, and spotted stomachs. They can reach lengths of 3-8 in (7.6 to 20 cm) in adulthood, and are typically stocky. Red salamanders and mud salamanders are very difficult to distinguish from each other. The main differences are in their eyes and snouts. While the mud salamander has dark brown eyes and a short snout, the red salamander has bright yellow eyes and a long snout. Mud salamanders generally have 16 to 17 coastal grooves found along the dorsal side.https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Pseudotriton_montanus/ Reproduction Mud salamanders breed during the warmer months of the year. Egg deposition commonly occurs during autumn and winter. The females reproduce at most once per year (usually once per two years), while males may breed several times a year. “When a mate is found, the male performs a tail undulation display. The female then straddles his tail, allowing glands on the male's tail to lubricate her. The male is then able to deposit his sperm into the female”. Females reach reproductive maturity around four to five years old, while males reach reproductive maturity around two to two and a half years old. “A female may stay with her eggs to aid the incubation process. Incubation typically lasts three or more months, with embryos hatching in the winter. Clutches range in size between 65 and 200.” Habitat The mud salamander inhabits swamps in low elevations, bogs, seeps, springs, and streams that not only provide a muddy bottom, but also clean and clear water. The mud salamander, a burrowing species, seeks shelter in burrows beneath leaf litter, logs, stones, or bark. The mud salamander may also build tunnels in creek banks, as well. These amphibians spend most of their lives in close proximity to water, but also burrow into the soil of the surrounding area. Larvae are usually underground in muddy springs; they are often found in leaf litter, debris, and muck of muddy springs, seeps, and streams. After they lose their gills and become adults, they make burrows in muddy areas. They often use burrows of crayfish and will sit with their heads sticking out of these burrows waiting for prey to pass by. They come out of these burrows at night and forage in the surrounding area. Generally, mud salamanders do not wander as far from their main habitat as their close relatives, the red salamanders. Mud salamanders seem to favor small, muddy seeps and springs that dry up in the summer. Both larval and adult mud salamanders go deep underground during the hottest months of the summer, especially in the small springs and seeps that dry up. The gilled larvae go deep in the mud where the water is underground and the adults remain deep in burrows. During the hottest times of the year, they are usually only found at night or during rains foraging for a short time before they return to their burrows in the mud. Dusky salamanders are often found in the same habitat as mud salamanders and are much easier to find than the mud salamanders. When this is the case, the more abundant dusky salamanders often serve as a food source for the mud salamanders. There are many scenarios where small muddy springs where mud salamanders live feed into larger streams that have more common species such as dusky and two-lined salamanders. In this case, the muds venture into the main stream and can often be found in it because they are looking for more food outside of their smaller, more primary habitat. One reason for this is less competition outside of a smaller habitat full of mud salamanders, another reason is the abundant two lined and dusky salamanders that are food for the larger muds. They can often be found in creeks that do not seem like ideal habitat for them because they have ventured out of their primary habitat for food. Chances are an ideal muddy habitat is within walking distance from where the mud salamander was found in the stream. Diet A mud salamander's diet varies with age. In the larval stage, the small creatures tend to feed on equal-sized or smaller, aquatic invertebrates. The salamander larvae are also said to consume other salamander larvae. As an adult, though, the salamander's diet increases in variety, but it still eats smaller prey. Though not much is known about an adult salamander's eating habits, it is known that they are likely to feed on earthworms, beetles, spiders, and even smaller kinds of salamanders. Mud salamanders also can eat invertebrates as small as mites. What the mud salamander tends to eat however, mainly lies in the habitat in which it lives. Conservation status Because of the mud salamander's extreme rarity in Virginia, it was put on the threatened species list in 1979. The Virginia Herpetological Society regards this species to be secure globally, but in danger in Virginia because of its extreme rarity there.(Office of Natural Lands Management 1992). Many surveys and searches were run in the 1980s to locate the populations of the mud salamander in western Virginia. Although efforts were great, few sightings of this species were made. Because little information about the species is known, it is difficult to find possible threats, but threats to other types of salamanders probably affect mud salamanders.

Almost a year later, his remains were discovered miles away. After 25 years of suspicion, Lodzinski was ultimately convicted of his murder. In the weeks and months after Timmy's disappearance, the case received considerable regional and national publicity. On April 23, 1992, his partial remains were discovered across the Raritan River in the marshlands of Edison, New Jersey, near one of Lodzinski's previous employment locations. She was considered the primary suspect in the crime – but despite major inconsistencies in her story, two failed polygraph tests, a self-kidnapping hoax, and years of intense scrutiny, she was not charged with Timmy's death until August 6, 2014, which would have been his 29th birthday. At trial, extensive witness testimony for the \\"cold case\\" prosecution successfully overcame inadmissible facts and a lack of forensic evidence directly connecting Lodzinski to the crime. On May 18, 2016, a unanimous jury convicted her of first-degree murder. After unsuccessful motions of appeal, she was sentenced to 30 years in prison with no possibility of parole. Disappearance The evening of Saturday, May 25, 1991, during the Memorial Day weekend, Michelle Lodzinski said she and her son visited the South Amboy Elks Club carnival in Sayreville's Kennedy Park. Lodzinski told police that her son went missing when she left him waiting in a carnival ride line as she went to buy a soda. Police officers, firefighters, volunteers, and trained dogs immediately launched an exhaustive search of the carnival grounds and the surrounding area, to no avail. Timmy's father, George Wiltsey, was at home in Iowa, uninvolved in the boy's life, and eliminated as a suspect. The case was televised twice on America's Most Wanted, and Timmy's photograph was circulated on thousands of missing-child flyers and milk cartons. In a \\"bitter irony\\", May 25 was National Missing Children's Day, an annual observance inspired by a previous high-profile disappearance. Inconsistencies Michelle Lodzinski, speaking to the press shortly after her son's disappearance Lodzinski reported to investigators that she and her son had spent time at Holmdel Park during the afternoon before driving to the evening carnival. According to park police, the Holmdel lot where she claimed to have parked was closed that day. Despite her claim to have spent more than an hour at the Elks carnival, with Timmy dressed in bright red, the authorities could find no one who had seen her son that night. As one witness testified: \\"I spoke with her and she did not have a child with her. I was very upset. There was a child missing and there was no child.\\" The last confirmed sighting of Timmy was by a neighbor who saw him playing outside that morning. More than a week later, at a police interview in Sayreville, Lodzinski claimed two men with a knife had taken her son and intimidated her into silence. Later that day, she returned to the police station and recanted the story, as the police began to consider her a leading suspect. The following day, she returned and gave a third story that her son had been taken by two men and a woman. She claimed to have known the woman as Ellen, a local go-go dancer and customer of the bank where Lodzinski had worked as a teller. Despite an exhaustive FBI search, no such \\"Ellen\\" was ever found, and Lodzinski failed two polygraph tests. Physical evidence On October 26, 1991, schoolteacher Dan O'Malley was birdwatching and exploring marshlands in the Raritan Center business park in Edison, New Jersey. He discovered a child's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sneaker, which had been highly publicized as the kind Timmy was wearing when he disappeared. O'Malley took it to the Sayreville Police Department that same day. The sneaker was shown to Lodzinski, who stated it was not her son's. It was then stored in an evidence area. After weeks with no word from the police, O'Malley reported the sneaker to a local newspaper, The Home News of New Brunswick, resulting in a front-page story and FBI forensic testing. Months later, after the forensic testing had been inconclusive, FBI agent Ron Butkiewicz read the newspaper story, contacted O'Malley, and they toured the location together on April 6, 1992. Upon re-interviewing Lodzinski's friends and family, Butkiewitz learned that she had once worked and taken frequent walks at the Raritan Center complex, within a few blocks of the sneaker's discovery, although Lodzinski herself omitted just this location when investigators had asked for her complete employment history. On April 23–24, 1992, law enforcement teams conducted a full search of the area. They quickly located a matching second sneaker in Timmy's size, and then found the boy's partial skeletal remains in and around a truck tire in Red Root Creek, near pieces of his clothing, a Ninja Turtles balloon, and a blue blanket. His identity was confirmed through dental records, and his death was ruled a homicide, although the time, location, and medical cause of death could not be determined due to advanced decomposition. Later developments On January 21, 1994, Michelle Lodzinski's car was found idling at her New Jersey home. The next day, she turned up in Detroit, Michigan, claiming abduction by FBI agents \\"to teach her a lesson for talking about Timmy.\\" Two weeks after she returned home, her brother found an FBI business card on her door with the message \\"It's not over.\\" Agent Butkiewicz resumed his investigation and found a local print shop that had recently printed FBI business cards for Lodzinski. She admitted faking her own kidnapping but refused to discuss her contradictory accounts of Timmy's kidnapping, and was sentenced to six months house arrest and three years probation for the FBI hoax. In 1997, pregnant with her second child, Lodzinski pleaded guilty to stealing a computer from a former employer, and was again sentenced to house arrest and probation. In 1998 she moved to Florida, then in 1999 to Minnesota, where she was married in 2001 and started a new family. The marriage did not last long and pregnant with her third child she returned to Florida in 2003, where she bought a small home in Port St. Lucie. As part of a \\"cold case\\" review that New Jersey prosecutors began in 2011, three of Timmy's former babysitters were each able to identify the distinctive blanket that had been discovered near his remains. Investigators realized that the boy would not have been carrying a blanket through a carnival on the humid day when he disappeared, and they concluded that the blanket was taken from Lodzinski's South Amboy home, for covering the boy after his death, despite her denial of ever having such a blanket. Arrest, trial, and sentencing On August 6, 2014, which would have been Timmy's 29th birthday, following a sealed indictment by a grand jury, Lodzinski was arrested in Florida and charged with her son's murder. After reviewing extensive legal arguments from the defense and prosecution, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Dennis Nieves issued a key pretrial ruling that \\"Lodzinski's active omission and hindrances to the investigation through her statements may reasonably establish circumstantial evidence of her guilt.\\" However, New Jersey does not allow failed polygraph tests as evidence in criminal trials, and Nieves also ruled that Lodzinski's self-kidnapping hoax could not be presented to the jury. The criminal trial began on March 16, 2016, and after testimony from 68 witnesses, the unanimous jury delivered a widely publicized guilty verdict on May 18 for first-degree murder, a week before the 25th anniversary of Timmy's disappearance. Sentencing was scheduled for August 2016 and then postponed, as Lodzinski's attorney appealed the judge's earlier rulings on juror misconduct and insufficient evidence. On October 25, Nieves denied the request for a new trial; and then on January 5, 2017, he sentenced Lodzinski to 30 years in state prison without possibility of parole.

Its skin is orange/red with random black spots. Its habitats are temperate forests, small creeks, ponds, forests, temperate shrubland, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater, trees springs. Overall this species is common and widespread, but locally it has declined because of habitat loss and it is considered threatened in Indiana. Red salamanders eat insects, earthworms, spiders, small crustaceans, snails and smaller salamanders. The red salamander, as a member of the family Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders), lacks lungs and respires through its skin. Description Pseudotriton ruber is a medium-large salamander, with adults ranging from in total length. Its sides and back vary in color from an orange-brownish tint to a bright red depending on its age. Like other salamanders, the red salamander seems to lose its color as it ages, becoming more darkly pigmented with less obscure patterns.Conant, R. and J.T. Collins.Peterson Field Guides: Reptiles and Amphibians.New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1998. Another distinguishing characteristic of P. ruber is the appearance of numerous irregular black spots down its back. Although the red salamander is brilliantly colored and has many distinguishing features, it is sometimes difficult to tell species apart. P. ruber is most similar in appearance to the mud salamander (P. montanus), but can be distinguished by the difference in size and number of spots running down the dorsum and also by the difference in the color of the iris. The red salamander has more spots and the spots also tend to be larger in size than those of the mud salamander. In regard to eye color, the red salamander's iris is a gold-like tint, whereas the mud salamander's iris is brown.Red salamander(Pseudotriton ruber).Savannah River Ecology Laboratory: Herpetology Program.1 April 2011 http://www.uga.edu/srelherp/salamanders/pserub.htm. Mud salamanders typically have a blunter snout than the red salamander. Also, the mud salamanders typically have a more contrasting dorsal and ventral coloration than the red salamanders that are more uniform in color. Taxonomy P. ruber In the Plethodontidae (lungless salamanders), many members respire through their skin and the lining in their mouths. Lunglessness in this family may have evolved due to an adaptation for life in streams, and members of the family Plethodontidae probably did evolve other methods for respiration other than lungs (i.e. gills) due to enhanced survival of larval salamanders in fast- moving stream environments of southern Appalachia.Wilder, I.W. and E.R. Dunn. 1920. The correlation of lunglessness in salamanders with a mountain brook habitat. Copeia 84: 63-68.Beachy, C.K. and R.C. Bruce.1992.Lunglessness in Plethodontid Salamanders is Consistent with the Hypothesis of a Mountain Stream Origin: A Response to Ruben and Boucot.The American Naturalists 139 (4): 839-847. Lungs in general help aquatic animals maintain position in the water column, but the larvae of Plethodontidae members are benthic creatures, therefore the adaptation of lunglessness would be beneficial to them since buoyancy would endanger their survival. The red salamander is further classified as a member of the genus Pseudotriton. Members of this genus include only the red salamander and the mud salamander. Distribution The four subspecies of P. ruber are found across the eastern United States, occupying streams through open areas such as fields and meadows, as well as aquatic areas through forested areas and mountains. Each subspecies is similar in appearance with slight differences in size and coloration, but are found in different habitats. The northern red salamander, P. r. ruber, is characterized as being red or reddish-orange with numerous black spots down its back. This subspecies is the most common and can be found from southern New York and Ohio to northeast Alabama, as well as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Similar in appearance to the northern red salamander is the Blue Ridge red salamander, P. r. nitidus. This species differs it is slightly smaller and lacks black coloration on the tip of the tail and chin. The Blue Ridge red salamander is found in elevations to more than in the southern part of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The blackchin red salamander, P. r. schencki, differs in appearance by having strong black coloration under its chin, as well as spotting all the way to the tip of the tail. It can also be found in elevations to more than in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The southern red salamander (P. r. vioscai) is often purplish- to salmon-colored and normally has white spots on its head. This subspecies is found from southern South Carolina to southeast Louisiana and southwest Kentucky. All subspecies of P. ruber occupy moist environments such as under moss and stones near clear water sources such as streams or springs. Red salamanders are normally not found near large streams, but instead near smaller water sources.Petranka, J.W. Salamanders of the United States and Canada. Washington and London: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998. Ecology P. ruber Some important aquatic and terrestrial ecological aspects of this salamander include its diet, predators, and microhabitat preferences. Larvae mainly feed on invertebrates such as insect larvae and worms.Bishop, S.C. 1941. Salamanders of New York. New York State Museum Bulletin 324: 1-365. Larval growth rates differ depending on the temperature of the water and tend to be higher in the warmer months when water temperature is higher.Bruce, R.C. 1972.The larval life of the Red Salamander,Pseudotriton ruber.Journal of Herpetology6(1): 43-51. The red salamander generally lays eggs in the fall and hatching season takes place in the late fall and winter. The larval period varies between 27 and 31 months and then metamorphosis takes place in the spring and early summer of the third year. Larval red salamanders are generalists, eating whatever is available.Cecala, K.K., S.J. Price, and M.E. Dorcas. 2007. Diet of larval Red Salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber) examined using a nonlethal technique. Journal of Herpetology 41(4): 741-745. Feeding rates typically increase when water temperature is low and larger individuals feed more than smaller individuals. Although feeding rates appear to increase with increasing size, mortality rates, though, seem to be independent of size or age and survival is estimated to be about 50% per year. The longer larval period ensures that transformation occurs when the salamanders are much larger than other species of salamanders and typically have a short juvenile period, maturing quickly. Males mature at about , typically at four years of age, and females mature at about , typically at about five years of age. Red salamanders generally live in springs or streams during the winter and then disperse to and from these sites in the fall and spring.Bruce, R.C. 1978. Reproductive biology of the salamander Pseudotriton ruber in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains. Copeia 1978: 417-423. Due to its semiaquatic nature, the red salamander remains in terrestrial environments until early spring then disperses to more aquatic sites. Adults often live in burrows along streams and in other moist environments such as under logs and rocks along the forest floor. Adult red salamanders, like their larvae, are generalists and tend to feed on invertebrates, as well as small amphibians. Its predators include birds and small carnivores such as skunks and raccoons. Since the red salamander is a large species of salamander, its presence or absence can greatly affect the ecosystem where it lives, and understanding its ecology is important to understand its role in community structures. Life history P. ruber has a wide range in its breeding season, which is only limited by extremely cold temperatures. Generally, however, adult red salamanders mate annually and engage in primitive courting activities.Organ, J.A., and D.J. Organ. 1968. Courtship behavior of the Red Salamander, Pseudotriton ruber. Copeia 1968: 217-223. Courtship between two red salamanders involves: \\"A male approaches a female, rubbing his snout against her snout, cheeks, and chin. The male then moves his head and body under her chin and starts tail undulations. The female then straddles the male’s tail and the pair engages in a straddled “walk” until the male deposits sperm on the substrate. The “straddle-walk” approximately lasts two minutes and once the sperm is deposited, the female picks up the sperm cap as she moves over it and then they separate\\". Females are capable of long-term sperm storage and may not lay eggs for months after mating. Females typically lay eggs in the fall or early winter in headwater streams, and have very well-hidden nests. Other important behavioral aspects of P. ruber include its defensive mechanisms. In regards to mating, males appear to not be aggressive towards one another, but do occasionally court other males as a means of sperm competition to get the other male to deposit spermatophores, giving them a better chance of successful mating over their competitors. When threatened, red salamanders assume a defensive posture in which they curl their bodies, elevating and extending their rears, and placing their heads under their tails which are elevated and undulated from side to side.Brandon, R.A., Labanick, G.N., and J.E. Huheey. 1979. Relative palatability, defensive behavior, and mimetic relationships of red salamanders (Pseudotriton ruber), mud salamanders (Pseudotriton monatnus), and red efts (Notophyhalmus viridescens). Herpetoligca 35: 289-303. The coloration of the red salamander has been hypothesized to mimic that of the red eft stage of the eastern newt (Notophythalmus viridescens) which emits a powerful neurotoxin in their skin.Howard, R.R. and E.D.Brodie. 1971. Experimental study of mimicry in salamanders involving Notophythalmus viridescens and Pseudotriton ruber schencki.Nature 233:277. This hypothesis, however, was heavily criticized due to significant size differences in the organisms and the differences in the species’ times of foraging ( i.e. P. ruber mainly at night and the red eft mainly during the day).Brandon, R.A., and J. E. Huheey. 1975. Diurnal activity, avian predation, and the question of warning coloration and cryptic coloration in salamanders. Herpetologica 31: 252-255. More recently, red salamanders have been noted to have reduced palatability, so they are considered part of a Müllerian mimicry system in which all species are unpalatable and benefit from aposematic coloration. Conservation Overall the red salamander is common and widespread, but locally it has declined because of habitat loss and it is listed as an endangered species in Indiana. The red salamander is arguably one of the most primitive plethodontids, so is extremely valuable in understanding the links to ancestors and the evolutionary processes that have occurred. Maintaining species diversity is an important part of conservation, and to prevent the loss of salamander diversity as a whole, it is important to have some type of management plan in place to prevent P. ruber from escalating from a low conservation status to a higher level of concern. Since the red salamander prefers streams that are relatively pure, it is important to monitor human waste and pollution, since debris and silt could have adverse effects on their habitat, potentially causing a threat to survival.

It is about the fictional American marathon runner and Olympic hopeful Michael Andropolis and his struggle to compete in the Olympic Games. Plot Michael Andropolis is a US hopeful for the 1976 (Montreal) Summer Olympics as a marathon runner. However, his life is fraught with trouble. His marriage, which produced two children, has fallen apart and his wife wants a divorce. He struggles with unemployment and at one point in the movie is seen snapping due to frustration with the unemployment office bureaucracy. Additionally, his coach is reluctant to endorse him for the games. Andropolis always starts races strong, but because of his over-competitive strive, he pulls ahead of the pack too soon, sapping strength he'll need for the final minutes of the race. So he tends to not come in first, having used his stamina too early. His coach feels he is a quitter. However, he providentially makes it through to the Montreal by finishing fourth in the qualifiers, but getting the ticket due to an injury in one of the top three finishers. Andropolis surprises everyone, by pacing himself early in the race, only pulling ahead halfway through the race. Well on his way to the finish line ahead of the main pack, Andropolis slips on wet leaves rounding a turn. The fall leaves him with shoulder and leg injuries as other runners pass him by. As darkness falls, paramedics tend to him where he fell. Andropolis is overcome by the need to \\"finish\\" the task of the race. He gets up, limping by and winding his way through traffic on roads that have been re-opened, as the marathon rules mark, and since the presumed final competitor had crossed the finish line hours earlier. Exhausted by the grueling ordeal of finishing the race with numerous injuries, Andropolis is greeted with cheers and support from the entire Olympic Stadium. He is met at the finish line by his wife, who has come to Montreal to watch him and promises that he will come home with her whatever happens. His coach witnesses his finish with a proud smile, while his daughters watch him on TV.

Different backing materials and adhesives can be used depending on the intended use.  History  Pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA), a key component of some adhesive tapes, was first developed in 1845 by Dr. Horace Day, a surgeon.Journal of the American Institute for Conservation, By Merrily A. Smith, Norvell M. M. Jones, II, Susan L. Page and Marian Peck Dirda;JAIC 1984, Volume 23, Number 2, Article 3 (pp. 101 to 113) In 1901, the German Oscar Troplowitz invented an adhesive patch called Leukoplast for the German company Beiersdorf AG. In 1936, German company Beiersdorf AG invented a transparent adhesive patch called Tesa.Tesa.de: Geschichte (German)  Adhesive strength versus shape  Adhesiveness depends not only on the type of tape but also on its macroscopic shape. Tapes with sharp corners start to detach at pointed corners. Adhesive strength can be improved by rounding the corners.  Types   Pressure-sensitive tape  Dennison Mending Tape from the second half of the 20th century. From the Museo del Objeto del Objeto collection. Duct Tape Pressure-sensitive tape, PSA tape, self-stick tape or sticky tape consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or metal foil. It is sticky (tacky) without any heat or solvent for activation and adheres with light pressure. These tapes usually require a release agent on their backing or a release liner to cover the adhesive. Sometimes, the term \\"adhesive tape\\" is used for these tapes. Many pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes exhibit triboluminescence, observable in a dark room, when peeled off a dispenser roll or other surface.  Water activated tape  Water activated tape, gummed paper tape or gummed tape is starch- or sometimes animal glue- based adhesive on a kraft paper backing which becomes sticky when moistened. A specific type of gummed tape is called reinforced gummed tape (RGT). The backing of this reinforced tape consists of two layers of paper with a cross- pattern of fiberglass filaments laminated between. The laminating adhesive had previously been asphalt but now is more commonly a hot-melt atactic polypropylene. Gummed tapes are described in ASTM D5749-01(2006) Standard Specification for Reinforced and Plain gummed Tape for Sealing and Securing. Water-activated tape is used for closing and sealing boxes. Before closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, the tape is wetted or remoistened, activated by water. The tape is mostly 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide.  Heat sensitive tape  Heat activated tape is usually tack-free until it is activated by a heat source. It is sometimes used in packaging, for example, a tear strip tape for cigarette packs. Conversely, thermal release tape, such as REVALPHA by Nitto Denko, loses its tack and fully releases when heated to a certain temperature. This type of tape is used often in the semiconductor industry.  Drywall tape  Drywall tape is paper, cloth, or mesh, sometimes with a gummed or pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is used to make the joints between sheets of drywall materials.

Endemic to southeastern France and northwestern Italy, its natural habitats are temperate forests, rocky areas, caves, and subterranean habitats (other than caves). It is threatened by habitat loss. Description Ambrosi's cave salamander has short, stout limbs, pointed toes and a short tail and grows to around including the tail. There is a ridge known as a canthus between the snout and the eye. The colour is variable, being brown to black with marbling, mottling or streaking in grey, green, yellow, red, pink or brown. Some individuals are a uniform brown or black colour. The underparts are also dark with paler markings. Distribution and habitat Ambrosi's cave salamander is endemic to a small area of southeastern France and northwestern Italy. Despite its name, it is not restricted to caves though it retreats under stones, logs and into caverns in dry periods. At other times it is active on the leaf litter near streams and on wet rocky outcrops in wooded valleys at altitudes of up to . In the southeast of its distribution, where its range overlaps that of the Italian cave salamander (Speleomantes italicus), the two species sometimes hybridise. Behaviour Ambrosi's cave salamander is found in moist environments where it is active by night on the ground, sometimes scrambling around in low vegetation. Males become sexually mature at four years and females at five. After an elaborate courtship routine, a clutch of a few eggs about long is laid in a concealed location where they are guarded by the female until they hatch directly into juvenile salamanders. Longevity is estimated to be seventeen years. Status The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the Ambrosi's cave salamander as being \\"near threatened\\". This is on the basis that it has a very restricted range, its total extent of occurrence being less than , and suitable habitat may be declining locally. However it occurs in two protected areas, the Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre and the Parco naturale regionale delle Alpi Apuane. It is possible that the subspecies Speleomantes ambrosii bianchii may be reassigned to S. italicus, and if that were the case, its extent of occurrence would be reduced and its status would need to be reassessed.

It is one of two genera in the family to inhabit the Old World (the other being Karsenia), with the remaining 250 or so species being found in North, Central and South America. The genus is endemic to Italy and a few nearby areas (San Marino, Monaco, and eastern Provence). Characteristics Until recently, Speleomantes was combined with the web-toed salamander genus Hydromantes from the Sierra Nevada range of California, which are their closest relatives. They lack lungs; respiration takes place through the skin, which must be kept moist, and the lining of the mouth. The head is broad and distinct with prominent eyes. There are characteristic deep nasolabial grooves between the nostrils and the edge of the lips. The tongue has a broad tip and is extensible, being shot forward to catch prey. The tail is short, less than half the length of the body, and limbs are robust. The toes often have blunt tips and are partially webbed. Behaviour European cave salamanders are found not only in caverns but on the ground among leaf litter, usually near streams, in wooded valleys. In the open air these salamanders are nocturnal, emerging in wet weather to forage but retreating in dry weather into caves and crevices or hiding beneath stones or logs. When underground they are active at any time of day. They are agile and can climb on rock outcrops or vertical cave walls, using their tails as props. The skin secretes toxic substances, which may deter predators, as may their habit of rolling their tail upwards. Males are a little smaller than females. They mate on land after an elaborate courtship routine. The female lays up to a dozen eggs in a damp crevice and guards them until they hatch in six months to a year; during this time she does not normally eat, though it has been known for females to eat some of their eggs. The young emerge as miniature adults about without an intervening tadpole phase. Species The genus contains the following species: {  - ! Image !! Scientific name !! Common Name!!

Originally aired on April 19, 2006 on FOX network, the episode is written by Noah Hawley and Elizabeth Benjamin, and directed by James Whitmore Jr.. The episode features Dr. Temperance Brennan and FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth attempting to recover Brennan's memories after she awakes covered in blood in New Orleans. Summary The episode opens with Dr. Brennan in New Orleans, where she is taking her vacation time to help identify victims of Hurricane Katrina some time after the event with the help of Mike Doyle and Dr. Graham Legiere inside a temporary morgue set up within a church. Brennan begins to autopsy 'John Doe 361' who was found covered in mud with a small hole in the front of his skull. Detective Rose Harding and Dr. James Embry assist Brennan, hoping to discover whether the death was the result of the hurricane or foul play. James discovers something lodged in the victim's mouth and Brennan sends an orderly, Sam Potter, to X-ray John Doe 361. Following this, Graham Legiere asks Brennan out on a date, which she says she will consider once she receives the results of the X-rays. There is a flash on screen, and Brennan is seen lying on a bathroom floor soaked in blood, blood on her hands, and a gash on her forehead. She is disoriented as she tries to remember what happened but is only able to recover flashes. Brennan answers a phone call from the hotel clerk, who tells her that the bus to the airport is waiting. Having been told it was Thursday, Brennan is confused and wonders what happened to Wednesday. At the hospital, Dr. Ryan Halloway notes that one of Brennan's ears has been ripped open and her mother's earring taken, yet Brennan still has no memory of such an event occurring. While Dr. Halloway sends off the blood samples on Brennan's clothes for analysis, Detective Harding arrives to interview Brennan. The only memory she has is of Dr. Legiere asking her on a date. Booth arrives and takes Brennan to a restaurant. They discuss the last thing she remembers - her pending date with Legiere. After finding out from the restaurant owner, Peter LaSalle, that Brennan was at his restaurant on Tuesday night with Sam Potter, an orderly at the makeshift morgue who practices voodoo, they head to the morgue. Meanwhile, back at the lab, Angela Montenegro delivers the X-rays of John Doe 361 to Zack Addy so he can make an analysis of them. He calls Brennan and tells her that John Doe 361, who she does not recall, was 40 years old, of mixed race and was murdered. At the morgue, Sam informs Brennan that they had spoken on Tuesday night about the object lodged in 361's mouth, which was voodoo in origin. Sam explains that voodoo is all about balance and that the hurricane, brought on by Secte Rouge, has destroyed the balance of New Orleans. He states that the objects found in the victim's mouth, black gum root and a chicken foot, can only be found at a voodoo shop, which is run by a man called Richard Benoit. At Benoit's shop, Booth shows Benoit the evidence found in the victim's mouth and Benoit informs him that it would be the work of Secte Rouge, as it is part of an evil spell. Upon looking at the list of those who had recently purchased the objects, Brennan noticed one name in particular: Dr. Graham Leger. Booth and Brennan head to Leger's home, where they find him crucified to a wall three feet off the ground with a mojo bag around his neck. The police soon arrive, and a doubtful Detective Harding interviews Brennan and Booth. As Brennan explains, Booth notices Brennan's missing earring underneath a table and pockets it without informing anyone. At the morgue, Brennan discovers that John Doe 361's file is missing. Back at Brennan's hotel room, Booth notices a mojo bag on Brennan's bed full of sea shells, flesh, a strip of leather and a human tooth. At that moment, Harding bursts in and arrests Brennan, having found her blood at Legiere's house. Brennan goes quietly and, despite Booth's protests, reveals incriminating evidence about herself. At the police station, Brennan is interrogated by Detective Harding, before Booth and attorney Caroline Julian enter to shut Brennan up before she convicts herself. Detective Harding leaves after Caroline informs her that Brennan will not be saying anything else. Sam Potter tells Booth and Brennan that the mojo bags are being left with Brennan to prolong her amnesia. They then find out that according to the results of the toxicology screen, Brennan had not been drugged. Zack calls Brennan with John Doe 361's real identity, and inform her that he was called Rene Mouton, who was the head of a voodoo church and had offered aid during Katrina but then disappeared. Sam Potter suggests that this is the work of a sorcerer from Secte Rouge, and Brennan agrees while Booth is disbelieving. They go to the cooler, where they find the freshly killed body of Mike Doyle, with the body of Rene Mouton. Brennan suspects Mike Doyle's girlfriend for his murder, and Sam Potter scatters ashes across the body of Mouton, revealing an electrostatic charge, as some ashes stuck to the corpse more than others, revealing an emblem of a Cadillac Brougham, the car belonging to Richard Benoit. This instantly makes Brennan suspect his daughter, Eva, as the girlfriend, and thus the killer. At Benoit's shop, they confront him, who leads them downstairs to their basement, where Eva was hiding. In the basement, they find Eva dead, her body thrown onto a large spike fixed on the wall. Brennan and Booth search the room and find Mouton's skull and the spike used on Mouton and Mike Doyle. Sam tells Brennan that the basement was the place of a dark sorcerer and that the spike on the wall was usually used for animal sacrifices. Brennan suddenly comes to the conclusion that it would be impossible for Eva to kill herself, as the room was only 12 feet wide, and she could not have been running fast enough to stab herself the way the body was. Sam Potter accuses Richard Benoit of being the sorcerer and killer claiming that he killed his daughter so they would stop looking for the killer of Mouton. Brennan knows there must have been a struggle with him throwing Eva on the spike and tears Benoit's shirts open to reveal a freshly bandaged injury. Detective Harding arrests Benoit. Back in D.C. Brennan and Booth tell Angela, Zack, and Hodgins about their case in New Orleans. They debate whether voodoo is real. Brennan is adamant that it’s not, but can’t explain her amnesia, or why her blood tests didn’t reveal that she was drugged. Booth brings up the mojo bag. Brennan declares that objects carry no intrinsic power, and that things are just things. Booth reveals Brennan’s lost earring that he picked up at Leger’s house. Brennan stands corrected.

Morlais Castle is a 13th-century castle located above the Taff Gorge near the town of Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. Not much remains today of the castle first begun by Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Gloucester on land claimed by Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford. Warfare broke out between the Earls in 1290 and they were severely admonished and fined by King Edward I of England, who had to march down from North Wales to intervene. The castle was captured by Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294. The castle is believed to have never been fully completed, and the location was too remote and exposed to serve as a residence. The Bucks' engraving of 1741, however, shows that fragments of the walls then still stood high. Description The castle comprised a triangular inner ward with sides about 45m long and an inner bailey 60m wide. The inner ward had a round keep 17m in diameter at the north corner, a D-shaped tower with a staircase on the north side at the SE corner, and a similar tower projected from the south wall. Between the latter two was the gateway. On the west side was a freestanding building about 25m long. It was joined to the south tower by an almost square building. In front of the south tower is a deep pit, presumably the cistern. The outer ward has no towers on the west side, but there is a D-shaped tower at the south-east corner. The latter has a rib- vaulted basement with a central pier and a sharply pointed doorway. Against the east curtain was a large and thickly walled building over 20m long, and on the west is a smaller building. Little remains today, though, with only one room still intact in what would have been the bottom of the main keep, and small walls around the castle give us an idea of where it once stood. The moat stretches around most of the castle, although one side has vanished; this may be because of the lime quarry located there. The 18-hole Morlais Castle golf course is located to one side of the castle.

Endemic to Italy, its natural habitats are temperate forests, rocky areas, caves, and subterranean habitats (other than caves). It is threatened by habitat loss. Description The Italian cave salamander is a slender species with short limbs and grows to a length of about including a short tail. The head is broad with prominent eyes and there is a distinct groove between the nostrils and the edge of the lips. The feet are partially webbed. It is dark in colour with mottled reddish or yellowish markings and a dark belly. In the north of its range it is more variable in colour and sometimes hybridises with Ambrosi's cave salamander (Speleomantes ambrosii). Distribution and habitat The Italian cave salamander is native to northern Italy where it is found in the northern and central Apennine Mountains. Its range extends from the Province of Lucca and Province of Reggio Emilia southwards to the Province of Pescara. It is found in wooded valleys, on rocky outcrops and in caves and underground waters, often in limestone areas, at altitudes of up to above sea level. Behaviour The Italian cave salamander is usually found in areas of limestone rock, but sometimes in sandstone or ophiolitic areas. It is agile, climbing on cave walls and rocky outcrops. The female lays a small clutch of eggs in a crevice and these hatch by direct development into miniature salamanders. Status The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the Italian cave salamander as being \\"near threatened\\". This is on the basis that, although it is common over much of its range, its total extent of occurrence is less than and suitable habitat may be declining locally.

Neighbourhood Laflèche is primarily a densely populated residential neighbourhood. It is largely low- income, and similar to Ville LeMoyne and other parts of the Le Vieux-Longueuil borough. Most buildings in the area are single-family homes, but there are also many small apartment buildings scattered throughout the neighbourhood. Boulevard Taschereau, Boulevard Édouard and Chemin de la Grande Allée are the main arteries in Laflèche, and all three feature numerous businesses. Laflèche is reputed for its small house built with tar up planks taken from the rail industry. A good proportion of the first inhabitants of the neighbourhood worked at the Canadian National plant in Pointe-Saint-Charles, which made it easier for workers to carry large pieces of wood in Laflèche to build houses. The oldest house of the neighborhood is on Duke street. It was built at the end of the 19th century. History Laflèche is a neighbourhood that was built mostly between 1930 and 1960. During the beginning of the 20th century, the territory was part of the Saint-Antoine de Longueuil Parish. Originally known as St-Lambert Heights, the name of the land was changed to Mackayville in honour of a Montreal notary who managed the development of the land in the 1920s. With the opening of Jacques-Cartier Bridge in 1930 and the steadily increase of cars, many Montreal working families moved to the South Shore, including Mackayville. Montreal and Southern Counties Railway had a tram stop in Mackayville at the corner Grande-Allée and Edouard. The building, which eventually became a Perette convenience store, still exists today. Mackayville became an independent city in 1947 at the same time as neighbouring Ville Jacques-Cartier. Mackayville got its first sewer in 1956. The city changed its name to Laflèche on March 5, 1959. It later merged with the city of St. Hubert in October 1971, when its population was about 15,000. Throughout the 1970s, Laflèche was nicknamed petit Saint-Henri de la Rive-Sud (the little Saint- Henri of the South Shore) because its inhabitants were viewed as being rough. Demographics In 2001, the district of Laflèche was estimated to have just under 17,000 people. This makes it around the same size as the neighbouring borough of Greenfield Park. The below figures are based on the three census tracts that form Laflèche. Statistics Canada 2006 Census: Census tracts Language From Canada 2006 Census {  - ! Language ! Population !

It is the only species of the monotypic genus Stereochilus. It is endemic to the United States. Physical description Stereochilus marginatus are small salamanders, generally ranging from in overall length, with a thin, sharp head and a tail shorter than average salamanders in the plethodontids. According to Dirk J. Stevenson, \\"the basic color pattern is brown or dull yellow with narrow, alternating light and dark longitudinal lines along the lower sides of the body that break up on the tail into a netlike pattern.\\" Habitat and distribution This species of salamander is commonly found in the lower Atlantic Coastal Plain of Georgia. It occurs on the Atlantic coastal plain from northeastern Florida to southeastern Virginia. The species is \\"unusually aquatic for a plethodontid,\\" inhabiting \\"forested swamps fringing slow-moving blackwater streams, shallow ditches choked with aquatic vegetation, and mucky seepage areas.\\" Stereochilus marginatus is also likely to be found under natural cover, such as Sphagnum moss or the decaying remains of leaves and other natural materials left behind in riverbeds; they can also sometimes be found underneath the remains of trees in drier environments. Life history Stereochilus marginatus are one of about 35 species of Plethodontidae that lay aquatic eggs that hatch as swimming larvae.Zug, George R. \\"Lungless Salamander (family Plethodontidae).\\" Esbcohost.com. Encyclopædia Britannica, Sept. 2014. Web. 6 Dec. 2015. The larvae period lasts around 1–2 years. It generally takes 3–4 years to mature for breeding, and males reach sexual maturity earlier than females. Unfortunately, not much is known about their expected life-span. Diet and interspecific interactions Both adults and larvae's diets tend to consist of small invertebrates, including arthropods and worms. It is common to find Desmognathus auriculatus (southern dusky salamanders) and Pseudotriton montanus (mud salamanders) in the same environments. Predators of the Stereochilus marginatus may include larger aquatic fauna or insects.

They are endemic to Mexico and found in southern Veracruz and Puebla to Guerrero and Oaxaca. Thorius is the most species-rich tropical salamander genus relative to its distribution area (Bolitoglossa and Pseudoeurycea have many more species but also much wider distribution areas). It is not uncommon for two or even three species to occur in the same place. In such cases, species have diverged in terms of body size and dentition, apparently facilitating niche differentiation. The members of this genus are characterized by a small body — some species are less than in snout–vent length (tail roughly doubles the total body length). Their extreme miniaturization is accompanied by determinate growth and skeletal reduction. Their skeleton also shows unique features, such as ossifications of many elements that remain cartilaginous in other salamanders. Consequently, they are easy to distinguish from other salamanders. In contrast, they tend to be similar in appearance, making it difficult to distinguish species. However, molecular genetic methods have greatly facilitated identification of new species. Species As of November 15, 2016, this genus is composed of the following 29 species:Phys.org PeerJ: Three new species of miniaturized tropical salamanders are already endangered; {left; border:1px solid #999999; \\" -CCCC99; text-align: center; \\" !Binomial Name and Author!!

It is situated approximately south-east from Goole, west from the River Trent, and in the Isle of Axholme.OS Explorer Map 280: Isle of Axholme, Scunthorpe and Gainsborough: (1:25 000) : Together with Fockerby, which is contiguous with the village, Garthorpe forms a civil parish of about 500 inhabitants, measured as 418 in the 2011 census. Geography Garthorpe is located on low-lying land about to the west of the River Trent. Fockerby is immediately to the west, and the two places now form one community. Three minor roads radiate from the village centre. That to the north leads to Adlingfleet, while the road to the south-west leads to Luddington. A third road heads eastwards, and used to serve the ferry to Burton upon Stather, but now stops short of the banks of the Trent. It turns to the south, and follows the western bank of the river. West of the road and the river is the site of the deserted medieval village of Waterton.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 2006  History  Before the seventeenth century, the River Don, its waters swelled by those of the River Idle and the River Torne, crossed the region on a meandering course from Crowle to Adlingfleet, where it entered the River Trent. However, in 1626, the Dutch drainage pioneer Cornelius Vermuyden re-routed all three rivers as part of the drainage of Hatfield Chase. Prior to the work, Garthorpe lay on the east bank of the Don in Lincolnshire while Fockerby lay in Yorkshire. Before the opening of the Keadby Road and rail bridge in 1916, there existed a boat ferry from the east end of the village along Shore Road to Burton upon Stather across the River Trent.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 maps, 1887 and 1907 From 1903, the village was served by Fockerby railway station. This had been built by the Goole and Marshland Light Railway Company, whose line left the main to line at Marshland Junction near Goole, and reached Fockerby by way of , and . The line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in early 1903, and became the Axholme Joint Railway. They also took over the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, which provided a connection from Reedness Junction to . The station was initially named Garthorpe, but then became Fockerby. Passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, and the line closed to freight on 5 April 1965. Four days before closure, the North Axholme Secondary School at Crowle chartered a 4-car diesel multiple unit, and traversed the entire line, apart from the route south of which had been closed in 1956. The train was met at Fockerby by the headmistress and all of the pupils from Garthorpe County Primary School. Incoming freight traffic on the line included manure and coal, while most outgoing traffic was agricultural produce, including potatoes and tulips. Garthorpe is barely above sea level - and is about 1 mile from the tidal river Trent protected by large levees. Positioned midway between Goole and Scunthorpe, transport to and from must be by car. A local bus service is available. The former primary school closed in the mid 1970s necessitating a council funded bus service to the Luddington and Garthorpe infants and primary school in Luddington, south of the Village. The secondary school for the catchment area is North Axholme Comprehensive, away. In 2011 there was a local pub called the Bay Horse, but no shops. The Methodist Chapel closed at the end of 2010, and the local Anglican church is under threat also. The village also had another pub called the 'Plough Inn' which closed in 1918. In the 1860s, this had two signs, one showing the \\"Plough\\", and the other showing \\"Red Lion\\". There was also a public house situated adjacent to the River Trent where the ferry crossed to Burton upon Stather. This was called the \\"Sheffield Arms\\" on a map of 1886,Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1886 and \\"The Webbs Hotel\\" by 1907.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1907 Both The Plough and Webbs Hotel closed in 1916. During the 18th century, the local area was frequented by two notable highwaymen. Ned Mandrell was the earliest, and was said to have been a ruthless villain who was scared by none. It is thought that he was captured and hung and his remains buried at the southern end of Carr Lane, where the grass triangle is situated. The other was Snowden Dunhill, who lived much of his life in the village of Spaldington near Howden. His main hiding area was a place called Cow Lane, a local common pasture which everybody crossed as means as a short cut between the villages. After he was finally captured and sentenced at York Assizes, he was transported to Tasmania, Australia. When he had spent his time of hard labour and was due to be released, he died and never returned to be with the family who was waiting for him.

It is endemic to mountainous areas of north central Oaxaca State in Mexico. It is one of the largest Thorius species. Etymology The specific name aureus, Latin for golden or splendid, refers to the distinctive golden dorsal stripe that is characteristic of the species. Description Thorius aureus is a slender salamander with a narrow head and long tail. However, among Thorius it counts as a large and robust species, with males measuring and females in snout–vent length. The tail is relatively long and can be up to 1.16 times the snout–vent length in males. It grows to a total length of about and is one of the largest species in the genus. Females have a rounded snout but this is more pointed in males. The eyes are protuberant and the nasolabial grooves distinct. The nostrils are small and oval and the upper jaw contains teeth (these are absent in many other members of the genus). The limbs are short with slender hands and feet. The digits are partially fused but are free at the tips. The dorsal surface is light brown and there is a distinctive broad golden stripe running along the spine, widest on the head and back and narrower at the shoulders. There are several brown chevron-shaped markings on the stripe. Distribution and habitat Thorius aureus is found in a restricted area around the peak of Cerro Pelón on the northern slopes of the Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca, Mexico, at altitudes of between above sea level. It lives among the leaf litter on the forest floor of mixed woodland of oak, fir and pine and also in cloud forests. Being nocturnal, it hides during the daytime under rocks and fallen timber. Biology Little is known of the biology of this species. It is believed to feed on grubs, insects and other small invertebrates found among the leaf litter or under the bark of rotting logs. No eggs have been observed but they are thought to be laid on land and to undergo direct development into juvenile salamanders without passing through a larval stage. Status Thorius aureus is listed as being \\"Critically Endangered\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in its Red List of Threatened Species. This is because, although at one time common within its range, by 2008 no populations could be located, with only one sighting in the previous few years. Normally a resident of virgin forest, it does not adapt well to living in secondary growth, but the amount of logging within its range is insufficient to account for its dramatic population decline, which remains unexplained.

The school enrolls approximately 700 students, and is one of three traditional high schools in the Tuscaloosa City School District along with Paul W. Bryant High School and Northridge High School.Central High School - About the School , retrieved July 23, 2007; Our Schools , retrieved July 23, 2007. Central High School offers the International Baccalaureate program.International Baccalaureate Program - Central High School , retrieved July 23, 2007. History Central High School was formed by the merger of Tuscaloosa High School and Druid High School in 1979 in response to a federal desegregation order. The school operated on two campuses, a west campus (West Central) made up of the former Druid High property and enrolling grades 9 and 10, and an east campus (East Central) on the former Tuscaloosa High grounds enrolling grades 11 and 12. The former mascots and school identities were discarded for a new one. Nikole Hanna-Jones of ProPublica stated that the consolidated school \\"emerged as a powerhouse that snatched up National Merit Scholarships and math-competition victories just as readily as it won trophies in football, track, golf.\\" In 1998, the desegregation order was lifted by judge Sharon Blackburn. In August 2000 the district board voted to establish two new high schools, and to reduce Central's attendance boundary to a majority black area. This led to what could be referred to as the re-segregation of Tuscaloosa high schools. Even though the high school students took a vote to rebuild Central as one high school encompassing all four grades, the city council decided that instead they would build three separate high schools. Two new high schools, Bryant and Northridge, were opened in 2003. That same year the population of white students at Central dropped to three people, ample evidence of said re- segregation. This separation also resulted in the Tuscaloosa city high school system, CHS especially, dropping from a 6A school leading to a decline in the city's athletic standing as a powerhouse among schools in the state of Alabama at the highest level. Central High declined academically after the opening of new schools. In 2004, all Central students were transferred to West Central so that East Central could be demolished for a new Central High facility. The $31 million school building was completed in 2006 and houses all current Central students.Alison Schmitke, \\"Teaching Brown in Tuscaloosa\\", Rethinking Schools, Vol. 20, No. 2, Winter 2005/2006; Jonathan Shaw, \\"New Central Expected to Make Community Proud\\", West End Journal, April 9, 2007. Clarence Sutton, Jr. became principal in 2010. Demographics In 2014 the student body was 99% black, and 80% of the students were designated as low income. Curriculum For a five year-period in the post-2000 era, no Advanced Placement (AP) classes were offered at Central High. The post-2000 school began offering physics classes in 2013. Culture For a period in the post-2000 era the school had no yearbook nor a school newspaper. Academic achievement The State of Alabama designated it as a failing school in 2014, and was on the same list in 2017. The percentages of students in grades 9 and 10 in the 2015-2016 school year declared in \\"need of support\\" for subjects were, in the reading field, 68.6% of the total students and 44% of students taking the ACT, and in the mathematics field, almost 91% of the total students and about 65% of those taking the ACT.

Its name derives from the fact that it is made of bull's skin, hence its black colour (that tends to become brown as it is used), this way the ball contrasts with the white colour of the trinquets' walls.  Traits  Vaqueta ball, as new The vaqueta ball has a diameter of 44 mm, its circumference is 138 mm, and its weight is around 42 and 48 gr, depending on the variant (in Escala i corda lighter balls are preferred, while in Raspall heavier balls are used). The actual weight of the balls is the end of a process, that is, historical pilotaris such as Quart in the 1930s played with balls around 28 and 33 g. The lighter the ball the slower it goes and the less it flies (its direction). This change of weight has been favoured by \\"rest\\" players, who tend to be stronger and have to send the ball longer, but it is an extra handicap for \\"mitger\\" and \\"punter\\" players, who have to stop the ball or strike it in the middle of its trajectory and while it is still carrying a lot of force. During the matches, and before beginning every \\"quinze\\", the team who stands at the \\"dau\\" is allowed to change one of the six disposable balls (each team previously chose three of them). This way, if playing again a double team, a trio would choose a new ball, which are fast and with a long bounce, so that the opposing two players are forced to move constantly. Otherwise, the attacking team tends to choose heavier balls, since they exhaust more when defensing.  Elaboration  Vaqueta ball, used The making of a vaqueta ball is a piece of Arts and crafts. The \\"piloters\\" are mainly leather workers such as Emili López (Alberic), Enric Álvarez (Carcaixent), Miquel Baixauli (Catarroja), Joan Montañés (Llíria), Josep Bernet (Massalfassar), and Miquel Pedrosa (La Vall d'Uixó), or retired players as el Rovellet (València). First the \\"piloter\\" chooses the bull's skin, specially from the nape of the neck, which has to be 6 or 7 mm thick and which has to be very tough, so that the ball becomes a real stone when it is finished. Once the leather is chosen, it is steeped until it becomes 3 mm thick. During this process the skin becomes softer and the \\"piloter\\" may work with it. Next, eight triangles are cut and sewn up from the inner side with nylon so that they form a sphere. But before the last triangle is sewn up, the ball is stuffed with fluff. After that the last triangle is sewn up and the ball gets closed. It will be pressed for 3 or 4 days in order to acquire a perfect spherical shape. The elaboration process is finished around 1 month later, when the leather is absolutely dry. There are a number of reasons to explain the expensive price of the \\"vaqueta\\" balls: The handcrafted elaboration, the time consumed, the quality of the materials, and the few number of renowned piloters. Hence its price may be around €40–80, but there also on sale balls used by the professional players, though they are not as fast or tough as new ones.

It is now considered a member of the genus Eurycea, but was originally described as Typhlotriton speleus. It is endemic to the United States, specifically the karst regions beneath the Springfield and Salem Plateaus of the Ozark Mountains part of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Its natural habitats are freshwater springs, inland karsts, and caves. It is not currently threatened, but vulnerable to changes in groundwater quality and reduction in bat population. The grotto salamander was discovered in 1891 on the Ozark Plateau, and described by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1892.Graening, G. Fenolio, D. Slay, M. (2011). Cave Life of Oklahoma and Arkansas. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman. p. 7 . This plateau remains the only area in which grotto salamanders have been found. Description The larvae of this salamander are bold in coloration: brownish or purplish gray, sometimes with yellow flecks on the sides. Adults can grow up to 13.5 cm and larvae tend to be between 10 and 30mm. They have a distinctive high tail fin and external gills. The larvae have functional eyes and may live outside of caves in brooks or streams. After two or three years, the larvae metamorphose, at which point they lose their gills, their eyelids fuse shut or at least partially shut, and the now blind adult form spends the rest of its life in a cave. The grotto salamander is the only cave salamander which undergoes metamorphosis. The adult form is pinkish white, sometimes with traces of orange on its tail, feet, and sides, and has 16–19 costal grooves.Conant, Roger, and Joseph T.

The grotto salamander is found in caves and caverns throughout the Ozarks. They are known from at least 120 individual sites in Arkansas, 43 in Oklahoma and 25 in Missouri. As larvae the grotto salamander lives in springs and streams near cave entrances. As adults, They migrate deep into the caves themselves and live out their lives underground. They prefer waters between 5.5 and 16.5 °C, and feed on small, cave-dwelling invertebrates such as Gammarus, though they are also known to eat guano as well.Trauth, S. Robinson, H. Plummer, M.

The specific name refers to Mary Lee Inger née Ballew, first wife of Robert F. Inger who formally described the species in 1954. Description The type series of Alcalus mariae consists of two males measuring in snout–vent length. They are stocky frogs with depressed, broad head and rounded snout. Tympanum is visible though rim hidden by skin. Tips of digits are expanded into large, round disks. Legs are stout and relatively short. Toes are webbed and have disks similar in size to those on fingers. Skin of all dorsal surfaces is coarsely shagreen. Chest and belly are strongly rugose but gular region is less so. Tubercles are present laterally. Habitat and conservation The natural habitat of Alcalus mariae is lower montane forest where it occurs in the forest floor leaf-litter. Habitat loss is the most important threat to this species, although the area of type locality is generally well protected.

Life Durieu was born in 1830 in Saint-Pal-de-Mons, the second son of Blaise Durieux and Mariette Bayle, a farming family who had sheltered the clergy during the French Revolution. As a boy, both he and his brother were allowed to study at the local minor seminary at Monistrol-sur-Loire. Pierre- Paul felt called to serve in the foreign missions and entered the novitiate of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate at Notre-Dame-de-l'Osier on 31 October 1848. He professed religious vows on 1 November of the following year. After that, he did his studies in preparation for Holy Orders at the Oblate seminary in Marseilles. In 1854 Durieu was ordained as a priest by Eugène de Mazenod, the founder of his religious congregation, and, after being sent for further training in English and theology, was sent to join the Oregon Missions, where he was assigned to serve at St. Mary's Mission in the Yakima Valley and the Okanagan area of British Columbia. In 1875, Paul Durieu was consecrated as the coadjutor bishop for the Vicariate Apostolic of British Columbia by Louis-Joseph d'Herbomez, the Vicar Apostolic. Upon his death, Durieu became Vicar Apostolic, and later the first Bishop of New Westminster (which later became the Archdiocese of Vancouver). During his tenure, Durieu commanded the First Nations people of British Columbia to obey four directives: discontinue performing native dances; cease the practice of potlach; cease consulting shamans; and to abstain from drinking and gambling. He wrote a book of biblical stories in the Chinookan language in order to teach the Catholic faith to the native peoples under his care, and set up mission centers where they could keep their nomadic traditions but be reached by the missionaries. He attempted to secure treaties with the Canadian government to protect the rights of the peoples of the First Nations against the growing encroachments of the white settlers, to no avail. Durieu died in 1899 and was buried alongside his predecessor at St. Mary's Mission. The farming community of Durieu, northeast of Mission, B.C., is named after him.

He was also Voivode of Minsk, Voivode of Brześć Litewski and Castellan of Vilnius. Early life Sapieha was born in 1581, the son of Mikołaj Sapieha. He was the brother of Krzysztof Sapieha. Together with his brother Krzysztof he studied throughout Europe; travelling (between 1608 and 1613) to Vienna, Trier, Mainz, Paris, Madrid, Rome and Matla. In 1613 the brothers returned to Kodeń. Mikołaj began a political career, becoming a Deputy in the Sejm (Parliament) of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1621 and then a Member of the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1622. Between 1625 and 1631 he travelled again, visiting Italy. It was during that time – according to legend – that he was miraculously cured and stole a holy painting from Rome. Sapieha took part in the funeral of King Sigismund III Vasa in 1632, carrying the banner of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as the Lithuanian Great Standard-Keeper (Chorąży wielki litewski, vexillifer), a post he held from 1625 until 1633. In 1634, he was elected the Marshal of the Lithuanian Tribunal, welcomed the victorious Polish forces and the new king, Władysław IV Waza, returning from the Smolensk War. He remained a Deputy of the Sejm in 1637 and 1638. In 1638 he became Voivode of Minsk (from July), before taking the post of Voivode of Brześć Litewski in November that year. In 1642 he became the Castellan of Vilnius, a post he received for having supported the king against the Radziwiłł family. Family Sapieha married Jadwiga Anna Woyna who died in 1642 and then Elżbieta Prusinowska who died after 1648. He fathered two sons (Kazimierz Melchiades Sapieha and Jan Ferdynand Sapieha) and three daughters; Halszka Sapieha (died 1661 or 1662), Teresa Sapieha and Joanna Petronela Sapieha. Legend According to legend, this painting was stolen by Sapieha from Rome. His nickname \\"Pious\\" originates from his sponsorship of a church in Kodeń and a related legend.Note: disputed by some historians, and possibly invented by his great-grandson, Jan Fryderyk Sapieha, who very likely presented a much colorized version of the real events The legend states that he fell ill and began a pilgrimage to Rome. After seeing a holy icon of the Madonna in a private Papal chapel, he was miraculously cured. Afterward he decided to steal the painting that he believed saved him, so that it could be enshrined in his new church in Kodeń. It is now known as Our Lady of Kodeń, based on Our Lady of Guadalupe. For his crime, Sapieha was excommunicated by Pope Urban VIII. However, the excommunication was lifted in 1634 when Mikołaj agreed to represent papal interests and use his influence to oppose the marriage between King Władyslaw and the Protestant Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate. The icon he \\"stole\\" was also given to the people of Kodeń. No documents attesting to the theft exist and it is possible the icon was simply purchased by Sapieha during a trip to Spain.

It currently consists of Shadow in the Dark, with a sequel, The Haunted Cathedral, due out Winter 2007. Shadow in the Dark Plot summary Xan is a boy who lived in his village, Hardonbury, in 12th Century England. One morning while he was in a forest nearby, his village is attacked by bandits. He rushes back to his home, only to trip on a root, resulting in the boy being gravely injured. He is taken to Harwood Abbey, where he is nursed back to health by the Benedictine monks. In addition to the physical damage he sustained from his accident, he has lost his memory. But what he fears most of all is what he has thought he has seen lurking around the abbey: the Grim Reaper. In hopes of finding Xan's parents and jogging his memory, a kindly monk, Brother Andrew, brings Xan back to his village, only to find that it was burnt down in the attack and that all the villagers had fled to Clovis, the closest village. In Clovis they meet a farmer who worked with Xan's parents, who tells them that Xan's real name (for Xan is only what they called him at the abbey) is Stephen, and that his parents are dead. The night he returns to the abbey, the other boys show him the \\"Grim Reaper\\" outside. Xan, ready to disprove the boys, follows the cloaked figure to the room of a harsh and rough monk, Brother Leo. Later that night the same bandits that attacked Xan's village attack the abbey. However, no one was killed, not even Brother Leo from the Grim Reaper. Xan finds a coin that a bandit dropped on the floor, with the coat of arms of Lord Kensington, the owner of Clovis. He also \\"accidentally\\" overhears some conversations in which Brother Leo is trying to persuade the monks to sell the abbey to Lord Kensington so they can have guards from bandit attacks. A couple of nights after the conversations, the Abbot of the abbey was almost killed in an assassination attempt. Coincidentally, the Abbot was also the one who was most against Brother Leo's plan. Xan pieces together the puzzle and concludes that Brother Leo tried to kill the abbot to get the abbey to be sold to Lord Kensington. After he confesses his suspicions to Brother Andrew, they put it to the test by going to see Lord Kensington and ask if Brother Leo had been to see him. Lord Kensington's bailiff, Sir James, confirms this by telling them that he had, but that he was surprised that such a gentle and kind monk would do such a thing. After they leave, Xan remembers about the coin, which also links Lord Kensington to the incident. So Lord Kensington hired the bandits to attack the abbey, and when that failed, he hired Brother Leo to try to assassinate the Abbot. Brother Andrew, Xan, and Father Paul (the acting Abbot) ask for an audience with Lord Kensington with a magistrate present so they can expose the criminal behind the attacks. However, when presented the evidence, Lord Kensington exclaims that he had never seen the gentle monk and was appalled by these accusations. Xan finally realizes his mistake and corrects the accusations. It was Lord Kensington's bailiff that hired the bandits to attack the abbey, and Brother Leo wasn't involved at all. Sir James hired another bandit to assassinate the Abbot after the first attack failed. Sir James and Lord Kensington didn't know Brother Leo because they both called him gentle, when he is also gruff and not gentle in speech. With this finally made clear, Lord Kensington assembles his knights to Harwood Abbey, where another attack was surely waiting. They arrive at the abbey just as the attack starts and are able to fend off the attack. Shortly after they arrive, Xan falls off his horse and gets knocked unconscious after all his memories flooded back to him. When he awakes, the attack is over and most of the bandits are captured or dead. He tells Brother Andrew that he remembers who he was and his family. However, he still keeps the name Xan as a reminder that his old life is behind him and that this is his new life. The Abbot visits the bandit leader, Carlo, and forgives him, possibly rekindling the spark of goodness he has in him. List of Characters *Abbot: The head of Harwood Abbey who is almost assassinated by the bandit Carlo, but recovers and in the end forgives him. *Brother Andrew: A kind young monk who mentors Xan throughout the book.

In July 2008 Parlato signed a contract with independent record label ObliqSound. In Spring 2009 she was featured in The Documentary Channel's 4-part series Icons Among Us: Jazz in the Present Tense. In August 2009 she released her second CD, In a Dream. It was voted the best jazz vocal album in the Jazz Critics Poll (2009) and appeared on the annual the top ten lists of JazzTimes, NPR, and the Boston Globe. In Spring 2010 she was nominated for Female Singer of the Year by the Jazz Journalists Association. In June/July, Parlato performed at Stockholm and Healdsburg Jazz Festivals, and sold out jazz festival performances in NYC, Montreal, Paris, The Hague, Copenhagen, Stuttgart and Molde, Norway, with Taylor Eigsti, Alan Hampton and Mark Guiliana. In August, she was voted No. 2 Rising Star Vocalist in Down Beat's Annual Critics Poll. In 2011 she released her 2nd album for ObliqSound, The Lost and Found with Taylor Eigsti, Derrick Hodge, Kendrick Scott, Dayna Stephens, Alan Hampton, with associate producer, Robert Glasper. On this album, she introduced four of her own songs and wrote lyrics to compositions of her fellow musicians and for Wayne Shorter's \\"Juju.\\" In addition she reinterpreted a samba by Paulinho da Viola and popular R&B; songs by Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, and Simply Red. The Lost and Found placed in the top 10 in over 30 polls in the US and Europe. Parlato has been a guest vocalist on over 80 recordings, including three Esperanza Spalding albums Radio Music Society, Chamber Music Society and Esperanza, Kenny Barron's The Traveler, Marcus Miller's Renaissance, Lionel Loueke's albums Heritage and Virgin Forest, Terence Blanchard's Flow, and Terri Lyne Carrington's The Mosaic Project (Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album), singing lyrics as well as wordless vocals.

He served as O/C of the Cork No. 1 Brigade of the IRA after the deaths of Tomás Mac Curtain and Terence MacSwiney. Biography Born in Cork on 21 March 1881, O'Hegarty came from a family with strong nationalist roots. His parents were John, a plasterer and stucco worker and Katherine (née Hallahan) Hegarty. His elder brother was Patrick Sarsfield O'Hegarty, the writer. His parents' families emigrated to the United States after the famine, and his parents married in Boston. His father was a member of the IRB. In 1888 his father died of tuberculosis, aged 42, and his mother had to work to support the family. O'Hegarty was educated at the CBS North Monastery school in Cork. By 1902, he had left school to work as a sorter in the local post office, rising to post office clerk. He was a supporter of the Irish language, music, and Gaelic games. A committed sportsman, in his twenties he was captain of the Post Office HQ's hurling team. He followed his brother Patrick (P. S. O'Hegarty) into the Gaelic League and eventually the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was a member of the Celtic Literary Society by 1905 and founded the Growney branch of the Gaelic League in 1907. A puritanical character by nature, he was a non-smoker and never drank. O'Hegarty was a founder of the Irish Volunteers in Cork in December 1913. In June of the following year he was appointed to the Cork section of the Volunteer Executive, and then to the Military Council. In October the Dublin government discovered his illegal activities, so he was dismissed. Excluded from Cork under the DORA regulations, he moved to Ballingeary, where he worked as a labourer. From there he moved to Enniscorthy, County Wexford, where he lived with Larry de Lacy. On 24 February 1915, he was arrested, and tried under the Defence of the Realm Act for putting up seditious posters. But for this and a second charge of 'possession of explosives' he was discharged. The explosives belonged to de Lacy. The Volunteers appointed O'Hegarty as Commandant of Ballingeary and Bandon. During the Easter Rising O'Hegarty was stationed in Ballingeary when visited by Michael McCarthy of Dunmanway to propose an attack on an RIC post at Macroom. But their strength was fatally weakened, and having no reserves they called off the attempt.C Townshend, \\"Easter 1916\\", p. 237. In 1917, he became Vice-commandant of no.1 Cork Brigade. He worked as a store- keeper at the workhouse but was intimidating, and clashed with the Poor Law Guardians. During the War of Independence, O'Hegarty was one of the most active in County Cork. Like others, he was exasperated with Tomas Mac Curtain's inactivity, and refusal to be more bellicose. One such was battalion commander, Richard Langford, who joined with O'Hegarty's unit to make an unauthorized raid on the RIC post at Macroom. Langford was court-martialed, but O'Hegarty continued to rise in the ranks. They had plundered 50 modern rifles and ammunition, much needed by a unit starved of supplies. When a RIC Inspector was murdered, Mac Curtain condemned the shootings and called for their end. On 19 March 1920, Mac Curtain was shot and killed in his own home in Cork. The coroner blamed the British establishment in Dublin, but the police never made any attempt to investigate the killings. Shortly after these events General Tudor began the policy of Official Reprisals.Peter Hart, \\"IRA and its enemies\\", pp.247, 241. In January 1920, an inquiry was held into corruption alleged against \\"Hegarty's Mob\\" or \\"Hegarty's Crowd\\" running Cork City. He blamed the former mayors for the charges of incompetence, but remained on good terms with them. In a raid on Cork City Hall on 12 August 1920, the British managed to net all the top brass of the IRA in Cork. In an incredible failure of intelligence they did not identify the leadership as their prisoners. They were all released, including Liam Lynch, and O'Hegarty. Only Terence MacSwiney, the new Lord Mayor, was kept in custody and sent to England.Florrie O'Donoughue, \\"No Other Law\\", p. 92. Townshend, \\"The Republic\\", p.193. On 25 February 1921 the Coolavokig Ambush was carried out by the 1st Cork Brigade under O'Hegarty at Ballyvourney village (on the road between Macroom and Ballyvourney). The IRA suffered no casualties. However, the number of British casualties has been disputed to this day.Brigade Commandant, Cork no.1 bde, Report of Ambush at Coolakovig. Townshend, \\"The Republic\\", p.241-2. The brigade commanders in the southern division retained a residual lingering resentment of Dublin GHQ's lack of leadership and supplies. Sean Moylan, commandant of No.2 Cork bde, thought good communications with No.1 bde were to be vital; but little of this was seen via the organizer Ernie O'Malley at GHQ. At a meeting set up for 26 April 1921, when the manual of Infantry Training 1914 was produced it, the document, raised great anger. The meeting ended in uproar, when O'Hegarty who was \\"a master of invective, tore the communication and its authors to ribbons\\".Bureau of Military History, Witness Statements (WS) 838 (Sean Moylan). Townshend, p.279-80. O'Malley and Liam Lynch, the general, met with O'Hegarty in the mountains of West Cork, near a deserted farmhouse, just off the main road. In On Another Man's Wound O'Hegarty is described as wearing \\"a light-blue swallow-tail coat, and trousers, a heavy woollen coat, derby hat, with a twisted stick under his arm...he was bearded, mutton-chop whiskers.\\"E. O'Malley, \\"On Another Man's Wound\\", pp. 341, 343-44. In the retreat that followed, the Irish lost heavy casualties, and left their wounded to the good care of the British. These were the \\"Round-ups\\" in which the Irish slept outside in order to avoid being at home when the Army called. They were told by Brigade to learn the English National Anthem to avoid arrest. In East Cork brigade O'Hegarty uncovered a spy ring. He was ruthless in the treatment of Mrs Georgina Lindsay and her chauffeur who gave away information to the Catholic clergy, but remarkably lenient on brigade traitors within.Borgnovo, \\"Spies\\" p.6, 30. He was allegedly not too bothered about evidence; but was reminded that all executions of a traitor had to be approved by Dublin first. O'Hegarty became more and more aggressive towards the establishment, using tough language to impose his will over the area. He attempted to force the civilian TD's for Cork to stand down, to give way to military candidates, telling the Dáil in December 1921, that any TD voting for the treaty would be guilty of treason. But De Valera was decided, and overruled any interference with the Civil Government. Like the commanders De Valera rejected the treaty, but had already been defeated in the Dáil on a vote by Cosgrave's majority.Townshend, p.403. On 1 February 1922, O'Hegarty married Maghdalen Ni Laoghaire (d.1940), who was a prominent member of Cumann na mBan. O'Hegarty was on the IRA's Executive Council, but when there was a meeting on 9 April 1922, it was proposed that the Army should oppose the elections by force: as a result Florrie O'Donoghue, and Tom Hales joined O'Hegarty in resigning.Townshend, p.285. In May, Hegarty and Dan Breen entered into negotiations with Free Stater Dick Mulcahy.E. O'Malley, \\"The Singing Flame\\", p.76. A statement was published in the Press asking for unity and acceptance of the Treaty. During this time the republicans became very demoralized and ill-disciplined. But they had to gain strength before announcing independence from Dublin. The debate amongst the anti-treaty IRA command was increasingly rancorous. The bitter divisions split the anti- treatyites into two camps. Two motions were debated at the Army Convention on 18 June 1922. At first the motion to oppose the treaty by force was passed. These men included Tom Barry, Liam Mellows, and Rory O'Connor, who were all in favour of continuing the fight until the British were driven out of Ireland altogether. But one brigade's votes had to be recounted, and then the motion was narrowly defeated. Joe McKelvey was appointed the new Chief of Staff, but the IRA was in chaos. While he strongly opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, O'Hegarty took a neutral role in the Irish Civil War and tried to avert hostilities breaking out into full-scale civil war. He emerged as a leader of the 'Neutral IRA' with O'Donoghue. This was a 'loose' confederation of 20,000 men who had taken part in the pre-truce wars, but had remained neutral during the Civil War from January 1923. Over 150 persons attended its convention in Dublin on 4 February 1923.Townshend, p.445. By April 1923, O'Malley was imprisoned in Mountjoy Jail. In a letter to Jim Donovan (Seamus O'Donovan) on 7 April he blamed Hegarty for all this compromise and \\"peace talk\\".O'Malley, \\"The Singing Flame\\", p.305. Hegarty's role in the assassination of the Commander in Chief, Michael Collins August 1922 has been cited (The Great Cover Up) along with that of Florrie O'Donoghue and Joe O'Connor. As members of the 1ST Southern Division Cork they feigned claims of neutrality (but remained part of the iRB) in order to set up talks towards peace and the cessation of hostilities at the start of the Irish Civil War (Gerard Murphy, The Great Cover-Up, p 147 - ) Catholicism Although probably an atheist during the War of Independence, he returned later in life to the Catholic church. On forming the Neutral Group of the IRA in December 1922, he tried to unify differences in the volunteers between Republicans and the Free Staters. He communicated with the Papal Nuncio during the inter-war years in an attempt to have Bishop Colahan's excommunication bull lifted. Instead he turned to commemoration as a way to earn favour in Rome, with the dedication of a catholic church in Finnbarr's cemetery. After his wife's passing he became a close friend with Florence O'Donoghue until his own death, knowing the importance of benediction.Irish Dictionary of National Biography, vol.7, pp.543-44.(Sean O'Hegarty). He died on 31 May 1963 at Bon Secours Hospital, Cork.

More precisely, it produces a surface runoff hydrograph in response to a rainfall event, represented by and input as a hyetograph. In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff. A well known runoff model is the linear reservoir, but in practice it has limited applicability. The runoff model with a non-linear reservoir is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region. When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using flood routing techniques. 300px Rainfall-runoff models need to be calibrated before they can be used. Linear reservoir A watershed or drainage basin Figure 1. A linear reservoir The hydrology of a linear reservoir (figure 1) is governed by two equations.J.W. de Zeeuw, 1973. Hydrograph analysis for areas with mainly groundwater runoff. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 321-358. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. #flow equation: Q = A·S, with units [L/T], where L is length (e.g. mm) and T is time (e.g. h, day) #continuity or water balance equation: R = Q + dS/dT, with units [L/T] where: Q is the runoff or discharge R is the effective rainfall or rainfall excess or recharge A is the constant reaction factor or response factor with unit [1/T] S is the water storage with unit [L] dS is a differential or small increment of S dT is a differential or small increment of T Runoff equation A combination of the two previous equations results in a differential equation, whose solution is: * Q2 = Q1 exp{−A (T2 − T1)} + R[1 − exp{−A (T2 − T1)}] This is the runoff equation or discharge equation, where Q1 and Q2 are the values of Q at time T1 and T2 respectively while T2−T1 is a small time step during which the recharge can be assumed constant. Computing the total hydrograph Provided the value of A is known, the total hydrograph can be obtained using a successive number of time steps and computing, with the runoff equation, the runoff at the end of each time step from the runoff at the end of the previous time step. Unit hydrograph The discharge may also be expressed as: Q = − dS/dT . Substituting herein the expression of Q in equation (1) gives the differential equation dS/dT = A·S, of which the solution is: S = exp(− A·t) . Replacing herein S by Q/A according to equation (1), it is obtained that: Q = A exp(− A·t) . This is called the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) because the Q herein equals Q2 of the foregoing runoff equation using R = 0, and taking S as unity which makes Q1 equal to A according to equation (1). The availability of the foregoing runoff equation eliminates the necessity of calculating the total hydrograph by the summation of partial hydrographs using the IUH as is done with the more complicated convolution method.D.A. Kraijenhoff van de Leur, 1973. Rainfall-runoff relations and computational models. In: Drainage Principle and Applications, Vol. II, Chapter 16, Theories of field drainage and watershed runoff. p 245-320. Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Determining the response factor A When the response factor A can be determined from the characteristics of the watershed (catchment area), the reservoir can be used as a deterministic model or analytical model, see hydrological modelling. Otherwise, the factor A can be determined from a data record of rainfall and runoff using the method explained below under non-linear reservoir. With this method the reservoir can be used as a black box model. Conversions 1 mm/day corresponds to 10 m3/day per ha of the watershed 1 l/s per ha corresponds to 8.64 mm/day or 86.4 m3/day per ha Non-linear reservoir Figure 2. A non-linear reservoir Contrary to the linear reservoir, the non linear reservoir has a reaction factor A that is not a constant,Land drainage and soil salinity: some Mexican experiences. In: ILRI Annual Report 1995, p. 44-53. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen (ILRI), The Netherlands. On line: but it is a function of S or Q (figure 2, 3). Normally A increases with Q and S because the higher the water level is the higher the discharge capacity becomes. The factor is therefore called Aq instead of A. The non-linear reservoir has no usable unit hydrograph. During periods without rainfall or recharge, i.e. when R = 0, the runoff equation reduces to * Q2 = Q1 exp { − Aq (T2 − T1) }, or: or, using a unit time step (T2 − T1 = 1) and solving for Aq: * Aq = − ln (Q2/Q1) Hence, the reaction or response factor Aq can be determined from runoff or discharge measurements using unit time steps during dry spells, employing a numerical method. Figure 3 shows the relation between Aq (Alpha) and Q for a small valley (Rogbom) in Sierra Leone. Figure 4 shows observed and simulated or reconstructed discharge hydrograph of the watercourse at the downstream end of the same valley.A.Huizing, 1988. Rainfall-Runoff relations in a small cultivated valley in Sierra Leone. Wetland Utilization Research Project. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands Rainfall-runoff relations of a small valley assessed with a non-linear reservoir model. In: International Journal of Environmental Science, January 1019. On line: Recharge Figure 7. Runoff from the water balance The recharge, also called effective rainfall or rainfall excess, can be modeled by a pre-reservoir (figure 6) giving the recharge as overflow. The pre-reservoir knows the following elements: *a maximum storage (Sm) with unit length [L] *an actual storage (Sa) with unit [L] *a relative storage: Sr = Sa/Sm *a maximum escape rate (Em) with units length/time [L/T]. It corresponds to the maximum rate of evaporation plus percolation and groundwater recharge, which will not take part in the runoff process (figure 5, 6) *an actual escape rate: Ea = Sr·Em *a storage deficiency: Sd = Sm + Ea − Sa The recharge during a unit time step (T2−T1=1) can be found from R = Rain − Sd The actual storage at the end of a unit time step is found as Sa2 = Sa1 + Rain − R − Ea, where Sa1 is the actual storage at the start of the time step. The Curve Number method (CN method) gives another way to calculate the recharge. The initial abstraction herein compares with Sm − Si, where Si is the initial value of Sa. Nash model The Nash Model uses a cascade of linear reservoirs to predict streamflow. Software for this model exists.Software description for the Nash cascade hydrological model. On line: . The Nash model uses a series (cascade) of linear reservoirs in which each reservoir empties into the next until the runoff is obtained. For calibration, the model requires considerable research. Software Figures 3 and 4 were made with the RainOff program,RainOff, a computer model for rainfall-runoff relations using the concept of a non-linear reservoir. Download from : , or from : designed to analyse rainfall and runoff using the non-linear reservoir model with a pre- reservoir. The program also contains an example of the hydrograph of an agricultural subsurface drainage system for which the value of A can be obtained from the system's characteristics. Theory of the non-linear reservoir The SMART hydrological model includes agricultural subsurface drainage flow, in addition to soil and groundwater reservoirs, to simulate the flow path contributions to streamflow. Vflo is another software program for modeling runoff. Vflo uses radar rainfall and GIS data to generate physics-based, distributed runoff simulation. The WEAP (Water Evaluation And Planning) software platform models runoff and percolation from climate and land use data, using a choice of linear and non-linear reservoir models. The RS MINERVE software platform simulates the formation of free surface run-off flow and its propagation in rivers or channels.

Large adults can weigh more than . The skin is smooth on the dorsum, with or without scattered tubercles or longitudinal skin folds. They are brownish, grey, or yellowish above and white or yellowish below. They may or may not have a vertebral stripe on their backs. Habitat These frogs inhabit streams with gravel and rocks in primary and secondary evergreen forest. Males build a nesting hollow in a sandy stream bed area, and the tadpoles develop in streams. They can also be found far away from streams. Use and conservation The major threat to this species is collection for food, both for local consumption and for trade. It is also locally impacted by habitat loss.

It is found in the Malay Peninsula (from southern Myanmar and Thailand to Peninsular Malaysia); its occurrence in the Andaman Islands requires confirmation. It is a small frog, males being and females snout-vent length. Taxonomy Taxonomic work by Robert F. Inger and Bryan L. Stuart in 2010 on Limnonectes hascheanus and L. limborgi has led to better understanding of these similar species — L. limborgi has been considered a junior synonym of L. hascheanus. While the species are morphologically similar, mainly differing in body size (L. hascheanus is smaller), they are genetically distinct. This taxonomic work has also led to redefinition of ranges of both species, and the range of L. hascheanus (as presently defined) is much more restricted than what was reported in the latest (2004) IUCN assessment for this species. A male frog in breeding season Life cycle The life cycle of Limnonectes hascheanus has earlier been reported to have direct development (no free- swimming tadpole stage, which instead hatch as tiny full-formed frogs). Notice that the original observations of this phenomenon came from outside the range of L. hascheanus and probably apply to L. limborgi. More importantly, careful observations have showed that L. limborgi has free-swimming but endotrophic larvae; this probably applies to L. hascheanus too.

It is found in Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and possibly Zambia. It is the sister species to A. vertebralis. Description River frogs all have streamlined bodies with pointed noses and live close to water. They have well-developed hind legs and when disturbed rapidly leap into the water, where they may remain submerged for long periods. Males reach a snout–urostyle length and females . The toes are partially webbed. The colouration is variable but typically the dorsum ranges from dull brown to luminous green with a pale brown background with orange flecks, and is covered by small dark brown blotches. About half of individuals have a prominent pale vertebral stripe. The tympanum is more than half the diameter of its eye and is dark with pale flecks. The gular area is usually marbled, with the marbling extending to the chest; otherwise, the underside is unmarked and uniformly pale. The male advertisement call is a short series of frequency-modulated clicks, followed by a pause and a brief croak. They may call singly or in groups. Distribution and habitat Amietia delalandii is found in the highlands of southern and eastern Lesotho to above 2,000 m asl, in Natal in the permanent mountain streams originating in the Drakensberg Escarpment and with a wide distribution throughout South Africa, except in the dry west of the country. As a high-altitude stream breeder the species is vulnerable to infection by the fungus Batrachochytrium. They are adaptable species and may be found along large and small rivers, in savanna, forest fringes, and grasslands, and in ornamental ponds at elevations of above sea level. Their eggs are laid individually in slow-moving to static water and the tadpoles are bottom feeders. Conservation status It is a common and widespread species that is facing at most localized threats. It is present in several protected areas.

These species are rheophilic catfish chiefly found in the headwaters of major rivers in South and East Asia. They originate from the Brahmaputra drainage in India, east and south to the Yangtze drainage in China and the Annamese Cordillera drainages in southern Vietnam. Two species are known from the Mekong River: P. myzostoma and P. gracilicaudata. Four species are known from the (upper Mekong River) drainage of China: P. abbreviatus, P. gracilicaudata, P. myzostoma and P. prolixdorsalis. Taxonomy The monophyly of this genus remains doubtful. In 2007, a study rejected the monophyly of this genus. The premaxillary tooth bands in the catfish tribe Glyptosternina are important in identifying genera; in Pareuchiloglanis, the tooth band is divided into two patches, appearing in two types. In one type, the premaxillary tooth patches appear separate, divided down the middle by a deeper indentation; this type is characteristic in P. feae. This group is distributed in and to the west of the Lancangjiang River and overlaps the distribution of Oreoglanis, Pseudexostoma and Exostoma. In the other type, the premaxillary tooth patches appear to be joined with a shallow indentation in the middle; this type is characteristic of all other species of Pareuchiloglanis. This group is distributed in and to the east of the Lancangjiang. Species There are currently 21 recognized species in this genus: * Pareuchiloglanis abbreviata X. Li, W. Zhou, A. W. Thomson, Q.

Typically the cap has a deep central depression giving the umbrella-like to funnel-shaped cap the appearance of a belly button, or a belly with a navel. Similarly-shaped agarics are said to be omphalinoid in appearance. Etymology Omphalina is the diminutive of Omphalia which is a reference to the belly button or navel-like appearance of the small dome- shaped caps with a central depression. It derives from the Greek word omphalos. Historical nomenclatural confusion The generic name Omphalina is an ancient one, linked to the even older mushroom name Omphalia which cannot be used because it is an illegitimate later homonym. Historically, the former was generally applied to any white-spored, similarly sized and shaped mushroom. As a result, many species that still are labeled Omphalina, or were labeled Omphalia are in fact not true Omphalinas. The now conserved type species is Omphalina pyxidata. Prior to conservation of the type, typification was debated and unstable for several decades. Phylogenetic redefinition Molecular phylogenetic studies using DNA show this species and others on mosses with reddish brown to yellowish brown pigments that encrust the hyphal walls are related, while many other former Omphalinas are distantly related and are classified in other orders, or families, and in other genera. Biology Omphalina in the modern sense is a small genus of bryophyte colonizing mushrooms. They grow on mossy burned soils and in undisturbed mossy areas in Arctic, Antarctic, alpine and rural and urban sites. Many other bryophilous mushrooms occur in such habitats but they have other characteristics. Reclassified and excluded former Omphalinas Lichenized omphalinas, which are basidiolichens, are now placed in Lichenomphalia. An example is the species previously known as either Omphalina ericetorum or Omphalina umbellifera that is now called Lichenomphalia umbellifera; etc. Bryophilous grey to blackish former omphalinas are largely in the genus Arrhenia. Examples are: Omphalina epichysium, now Arrhenia epichysium; Omphalina sphagnicola now Arrhenia sphagnicola; etc. Any former omphalina with amyloid spores goes into another genus. These genera include Mycena, Myxomphalia, Pseudoarmillariella, Xeromphalina, etc. No true Omphalina has gelatinized or slimy tissues or brightly colored pigments. Neither do they have cystidia. Excluded species whose exclusion is supported by molecular analysis, include the genera: Blasiphalia, Chrysomphalina, Chromosera, Contumyces, Gerronema, Haasiella, Loreleia, Rickenella, etc. Species *Omphalina arctica *Omphalina chionophila *Omphalina demissa *Omphalina favrei *Omphalina foetida *Omphalina fulvopallens *Omphalina grisea *Omphalina kuehneri *Omphalina mutila *Omphalina nothofaginea *Omphalina pseudomuralis *Omphalina pyxidata *Omphalina rivulicola *Omphalina subhepatica *Omphalina wallacei *Omphalina wellingtonensis See also *List of Tricholomataceae genera References Category:Tricholomataceae Category:Agaricales genera ","title":"Omphalina"},{"id":"12405181","text":"Goicoechea is a canton in the San José province of Costa Rica.

Formerly, it was placed in the family Ranidae. It occurs widely in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. A newly described species, A. poyntoni, was split from this species in 2013. Description The Cape river frog is a fairly large, typical frog with a snout-to-vent measurement of up to about 125 mm. The snout is slightly rounded. It has a powerful, athletic build with long hind legs and feet, well adapted for leaping, but also well webbed; the species is a powerful swimmer. The fore feet are not webbed. When the animal sits at rest on a level surface, the tip of the longest rear toe reaches to directly below the tympanum. The ventral skin is smooth and white, except for dark mottling on the throat. The mottling inspired the specific epithet fuscigula: Latin for \\"dusky throated\\". In some specimens, the mottling extends to the belly. The dorsal skin bears a modest sprinkling of small, rounded protuberances and segments of longitudinal ridges. The colour scheme is variable, ranging from dark- through light-brown, also commonly green or olive, or with green streaks. The back and limbs are more or less conspicuously blotched with darker irregular spots. Little sexual dimorphism is noted, but the male in breeding season bears a dark, swollen nuptial pad on each thumb. The eye and tympanum are prominent; the diameter of the tympanum is barely smaller than that of the eye.Du Preez, L. H., Carruthers, Vincent; A complete guide to the frogs of southern Africa. Pub: Cape Town, South Africa : Struik Nature, 2009 Amietia fuscigula, an olive-coloured specimen in the Western Cape, human-habituated in a suburban garden. Habitat The Cape river frog occurs in a wide range of temperate to tropical habitats wherever fresh water is at least sufficient seasonally for breeding, including arable land, pastureland, savanna, shrubland, fynbos, grassland, rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes, marshes and springs, water storage areas, ponds, dams, and sewage treatment areas. Sometimes they even will occupy and breed in domestic water containers such as water butts or horse troughs. Habits Amietia fuscigula is largely diurnal, though its call and breeding activity are mainly nocturnal or crepuscular. It prefers permanent water and commonly colonises dams and other artificial water bodies, but in some regions it is limited to seasonal transient water bodies. Where it occupies farm dams, it commonly emerges during the morning and takes up an inconspicuous position on the bank where it basks until the sun becomes too intense near noon. While basking, it is much sought by predators such as herons and is accordingly shy; one of its most familiar manifestations is a series of plops as frogs successively leap into the water while any threat walks by.Rose, Walter; The reptiles and amphibians of southern Africa; Pub: Maskew Miller, 1950 On entering the water, the alarmed frog dives strongly and either hides under the shelter of logs or stones, or scuttles briefly about the mud, obscuring itself under the opaque cloud it has made in the water. However, in situations such as garden ponds, it readily becomes habituated to inoffensive human presence. The voice is confusingly variable, particularly where it occurs together with several other noisy species. Males may call at any time of the year in various regions, but calling peaks in the breeding season. Typically, a call begins with a rattle of clicks about 0.1 seconds apart, like a slowly played güiro or a thumbnail run over the teeth of a comb, followed by a short series of brief croaks. Where a number of calling males compete, the calls rise in pitch, volume, and speed. It is an active opportunistic predator, readily feeding on moderately sized invertebrates such as crickets, but also attacks small reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, including smaller members of its own species. When it occupies streams and ditches, the Cape river frog prefers deep ponds such as occur below inlets and races where the turbulent flow hollows out convenient shelters. It also prefers deep, still water for its breeding, where its tadpoles grow fairly slowly, but achieve a large size; in shallow streams, they mature more rapidly into smaller juvenile frogs. A typical size for a mature tadpole is about 80 mm, but in deep, cool, permanent water, they might grow to twice that length. In warm shallow water with plenty of food, the period of development may take about 9 months to a year, but in cold, deep water with little food, it might take two years. In size, shape, and their brown coloration, the tadpoles are typical of large, vigorous species of frogs; they are strong swimmers with large tails about two to three times as long as the body, and with the tip tapering to a point. The body is oval. Status The Cape river frog, though locally threatened by habitat loss, for example because of dam building, is currently regarded as \\"least concern\\" because it occurs plentifully over wide areas, including in local isolated populations, and is not a specialist feeder. It also survives in altered habitats such as suitable pastureland and agricultural land References Category:Amietia Category:Endemic amphibians of South Africa Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Amphibians described in 1841 ","title":"Cape river frog"},{"id":"12405195","text":"Michael Steven Hessman (born March 5, 1978) is an American former professional baseball first baseman and third baseman.

He is currently the hitting coach for the Toledo Mud Hens. Hessman holds the all-time record for International League home runs, when he hit his 259th on June 30, 2014, breaking Ollie Carnegie's record set in 1945. In 2015, he broke Buzz Arlett's record for the most career minor league home runs, hitting his 433rd on August 3, 2015. Professional career Hessman was originally drafted out of Mater Dei High School in the 15th round (452nd overall) by the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 MLB draft. He spent eight years in the Braves organization before making his Major League debut on August 22, 2003. His first major league hit was a pinch-hit home run on August 26, 2003, off New York Mets pitcher Mike Stanton. Hessman signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers on January 7, 2005. He played for the Tigers' Triple-A affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens, for the whole season, and helped them win the International League championship for the first time in 38 years. Hessman batted .214 with 28 home runs and 74 RBI. He spent the entire 2006 season with the Mud Hens, contributing to the Mud Hens' second consecutive Governors' Cup. Though he hit 24 home runs that season, he hit just .165. Hessman played 117 games for the Mud Hens in 2007, and hit .254 with 31 home runs and 101 RBI. On June 1, he hit his 68th career home run with the Mud Hens, breaking Erve Beck's 107-year old franchise record.

History 19th and 20th centuries Grave of James B. and Elizabeth Stephens, donors of the land The original land owner, James B. Stephens, purchased a land claim extending from the east bank of the Willamette River to present day Southeast 23rd and from Stark Street to Division Street. J. B. Stephens' father Emmor Stephens died shortly after the Stephens family arrived to Oregon in 1846 and was buried on the family farm. In 1854, Stephens sold the land to Colburn Barrell, with the caveat that he maintain Emmor's gravesite. Barrell owned a steamboat the Gazelle, which in 1854 exploded near Oregon City, killing a passenger and Barrell's business partner Crawford Dobbins. Barrel then set up a cemetery by setting aside and burying the casualties of the explosion at the site of Emmor Stephens, calling it Mt. Crawford. Plots at the cemetery were then sold for $10 with additional being added to Lone Fir by 1866. That year Barrel offered to sell the cemetery to the city of Portland for $4,000, but the city declined and instead Barrell sold it to a group of Portland families and plotholders. The cemetery was then renamed the cemetery to Lone Fir, which was suggested by Colburn Barrell's wife, Aurelia, as there was only a single fir tree at the site. In 1903, a $3,500 memorial to the soldiers of the Indian Wars, Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War was built at the cemetery.A Brief History of Lone Fir Cemetery.

She made two voyages to the Antarctic to resupply the expedition. Acquisition for the British National Antarctic Expedition Morgenen was a Norwegian whaling ship, built in 1871 by Svend Foyn of Tønsberg, Norway. In 1901 she was purchased as a relief ship for the British National Antarctic Expedition for £3,880. In September 1901, she sailed from Norway to England where she was refitted and renamed Morning, the same name translated into English. Ships' company The officers that set sail from London in 1902 were: Captain William Colbeck RNR; Rupert G. England, First Officer; Lieutenant E.R.G.R. Evans RN, Second Officer; Gerald Doorly RNR, Third Officer; Sub-Lieutenant G.F.A. Mulock RN, fourth officer; Doctor G.A. Davidson; J.D. Morrison, Chief Engineer; and F. L. Maitland-Somerville and Neville Pepper, both midshipmen. The crew consisted of eight petty officers, nine seamen, and three firemen. During the voyages, the people filling these posts sometimes changed. London to New Zealand Morning sailed from London to Lyttelton, New Zealand via Madeira. She left London on 2 July 1902 and arrived in Lyttleton on 16 November the same year. Voyage of the Morning Although making two voyages to restock the expedition, it is the first that is known as the voyage of the Morning. She sailed from Lyttelton for the Antarctic on 6 December 1902. On Christmas Day, the crew sighted two uncharted islands, now known as Scott Island and Haggitt's Pillar. A landing was made and the islands were claimed for the British Empire. Morning became stuck on a rock for 20 minutes here. The crew also collected scientific specimens as she voyaged south. Morning called at several pre-arranged mail depositories in an attempt to locate Discovery, the expedition's main ship. At Cape Crozier, they found a message giving the location of her winter quarters. Discovery's masts were sighted just before midnight on 23 January 1903. Supplies were sledged across the ice to the Discovery when it became apparent that the ice would not break up. Ernest Shackleton joined the crew of Morning as he was suffering from scurvy, and Mulock took his place on the Discovery. Several other seamen joined the Morning for the voyage back to New Zealand. She left McMurdo Sound on 2 March 1903 and arrived in New Zealand on 25 March. A log of the voyage compiled by Leonard Burgess, a seaman, is held in the Macmillan Brown Library, University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Second voyage Morning returned to the Antarctic a second time in the company of the Terra Nova later in 1903. They were sighted at Hut Point on 5 January 1904. The two ships were to evacuate the Discovery if she could not be freed from the ice. The ice broke, however, and all three ships returned together. A log of the voyage, compiled by Leonard Burgess, a seaman, is also held in the Macmillan Brown Library, University of Canterbury. Cats The Morning had several ship's cats. *Bobs belonged to J.D. Morrison. It was lost overboard on the voyage between Madeira and New Zealand. *Night, a black female. *Noon, Night's white kitten. *Morning, a grey tabby, lost overboard. The Leonard Burgess log records \\"Nig\\" giving birth to 5 kittens at 11:30pm on 24 December 1903. The Songs of the Morning Doorly dictated The Songs of the Morning,, a compilation of songs written during the voyages. In most cases, the words were written by the Chief Engineer, John Donald Morrison, and were put to music by Doorly.

It is widely distributed in Sub-Saharan West and Middle Africa. However, the nominal species includes at least one undescribed species west of Benin; the formal taxonomic changes to split the species have not yet been done. Common names white-lipped frog and forest white-lipped frog has been coined for it, whereas Bamileke Plateau frog refers to now-synonymized Amnirana longipes (=Hylarana longipes). Distribution Amnirana albolabris occurs in West Africa (from west to east: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria) and in Middle Africa (from north to south and east: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and Kenya). There seems to be a gap in the distribution between western Togo and western Nigeria. Phylogeny and taxonomy Amnirana albolabris includes two very distinct lineages. The western component includes most of the West African populations and is the sister taxon of Amnirana fonensis. The Central African component also includes the Nigerian populations and is the sister taxon of Amnirana asperrima. The type locality of Amnirana albolabris is given as \\"West Africa\\", but later researchers have deduced that the correct locality is Gabon. The name Amnirana albolabris therefore refers to the Central African component. However, molecular data suggest that Amnirana longipes (Perret, 1960) is embedded within the Central African Amnirana albolabris and the former should therefore considered junior synonym of the latter. Description Adult females measure in snout–vent length. The snout is slightly rounded and the eyes are prominent. The tympanum is visible. The fingers have no webbing but the toes are webbed. Habitat and conservation Amnirana albolabris is found in secondary habitats and heavily degraded former forest in the forest zone as well as in gallery forests in the humid savanna zone. While in West Africa, it occurs in closed-canopy forest and in secondary habitats, it avoids closed forest in central Africa. Individuals are usually found low in the vegetation. West African populations breed in large temporary ponds and in permanent streams, while the central African ones breed in still- water ponds, marshes, raphia swamps and creeks. It is a very common and adaptable species that is unlikely to suffer from other than localized threats. It occurs in many protected areas.

The film examines the lives of Persian Jews living in Iran's predominately Islamic society. Although they face discrimination, they choose to remain in their homeland rather than flee the country. The documentary breaks ground as the first film to cover this subject, capturing both friendships among Muslims and Jews and the prejudices against the Jewish minority. Farahani states that Jews of Iran is meant to \\"help westerners correct their image\\" of the Middle East and allow them to \\"see the nuances\\" within the culture. Synopsis With the background of Middle Eastern music, the film offers shots of century-old architecture and travels through Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz. A broad range of Jewish Iranians are interviewed, from an old woman in a hospital to a bright computer science student. Although Jews have lived in Iran for 2,700 years, the 1979 Iranian Revolution pressured most Jews to leave the country. In modern Iran, rampant antisemitism continues to threaten the remaining citizens. Iran \\"They’re very open with their insults,\\" says a young Jewish girl exposed to prejudice in Iran. Regarding her treatment by Iranians: \\"They say we're impure — we're filthy.\\" Deep-rooted antisemitism is revealed when a beautiful Muslim art student is asked if she has any Jewish friends: she couples her negative response with a coy giggle, claiming that it is \\"because of the atmosphere Israel has created\\" that she is not fond of the Jews. When confronted with the point that the Jews in Iran are not Israelis, she simplifies her argument, offering a big smile and saying, \\"I don't know...They don't mix with us either. Never.\\" Religious tolerance is also portrayed. In one scene, two mothers, one Jewish and the other Muslim, have been friends since college. Both have raised sons that are now equally as close. The woman laugh about religious prejudice, and the Muslim boy explains his friend's Kosher diet by saying, \\"It's his choice. He eats what he wants.\\" When asked, the boys admit that they don't really talk about religion; they listen to the same music, attend the same parties, and lazily lounge around each other's homes. The two cultures also overlap and feed off each other. In Isfahan, Jewish artist Soleiman Sassoon's work is strongly influenced by Iranian art and Islamic architecture. Pointing to his paintings, he explains how he naturally blends religious motifs, such as the Ten Commandments and David's prayer, with a traditional Iranian art style. Finally, Farahani travels to Shiraz, where thirteen Jews have been accused of espionage.

This rule states that outer retinal diseases and media changes result in blue- yellow color defects, while diseases of the inner retina, optic nerve, visual pathway, and visual cortex will result in red-green defects. This is possibly related to the increased susceptibility of S-cones and rods to ischaemia and oxidative damage, although S-cone loss is more noticeable due to their lower density and their higher metabolic rate. There are exceptions to Köllner's rule, notably glaucoma, which is an optic nerve disorder, and is usually associated with blue-yellow defects in the initial phase, following which red- green defects later develop. This is hypothesised to be due to receptor- mediated excitotoxicity of ganglial cells, and that parvocellular retinal ganglial cells mediating red-green opponency are predominantly affected because they are more common.

It is owned by Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited (JNFL) and is part of the Rokkasho complex located in the village of Rokkasho in northeast Aomori Prefecture, on the Pacific coast of the northernmost part of Japan's main island of Honshu. History Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant Construction of the plant began in 1993, and was originally expected to be completed in 1997, but the completion date has been postponed 23 times by 2017. Construction and testing of the facility were complete in 2013 according to JNFL, and the site was intended to begin operating in October 2013; however this was delayed by new safety regulations.Japan's Nuclear Plan Unsettles U.S.http://www.jnfl.co.jp/english/topics/131219-1.pdf In December 2013 JNFL announced the plant would be ready for operation in October 2014. In 2015, the start of the reprocessing plant was postponed again, this time to as late as September 2018. In December 2017, the completion date was put back a further three years, to 2021, to allow for further safety measures at the reprocessing plant and the MOX fuel fabrication plant to meet post-Fukushima safety standards. The delays have caused many parts of the plant to deteriorate, and the closure of the unsuccessful fast breeder reactor at Monju in 2016 reduces the need for the policy of nuclear fuel reprocessing. In August 2018 more corroded pipes were found. In 2018 the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission updated plutonium guidelines to try to reduce plutonium stockpiles, stipulating that Rokkasho should only produce the amount of plutonium required for mixed oxide fuel for Japan's nuclear plants. In 2020 the completion date was put back again to 2022, for further safety measures including construction of another cooling tower.  Description  The Rokkasho plant is the successor to a smaller reprocessing plant located in Tōkai, Ibaraki in central Japan, which ceased operation in 2007. The Rokkasho facilities complex includes: *A high level nuclear waste monitoring facility *A MOX fuel fabrication plant *A uranium enrichment plant *A low level radioactive waste landfill In 2010, the Rokkasho complex consisted of 38 buildings on an area of 3,800,000 m². Vitrification tests completed in November 2007. This consists of pouring high level dry waste residue along with molten glass into steel canisters.World Nuclear News (WNN). Vitrification line tested for Japanese waste As of 2018, over a third of Japan's 10 metric tons of domestically held plutonium is stored at Rokkasho. Economic aspects Since 1993 there has been US$20 billion invested in the project, nearly triple the original cost estimate.The Failures of Japan's Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program - 1956–2007 A 2011 estimate put the cost at US$27.5 billion.Forbes, Japan's Other Nuclear Disaster, 4/6/2011. Protests In May 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho reprocessing plant, Stop Rokkasho,Stop Rokkasho was launched by musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Greenpeace has opposed the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called \\"Wings of Peace – No more Hiroshima Nagasaki\\",Wings of Peace – No more Hiroshima Nagasaki since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction to stop the project. Consumers Union of Japan together with 596 organisations and groups participated in a parade on 27 January 2008 in central Tokyo against the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.Rokkasho: Nobody talks, Nothing changes « Consumers Union of Japan Over 810,000 signatures were collected and handed in to the government on 28 January 2008. Representatives of the protesters, which include fishery associations, consumer cooperatives and surfer groups, handed the petition to the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

'Experts including Frank von Hippel, a Princeton University theoretical physicist, have urged Japan to stop spent fuel reprocessing.', reported The Japan Times. The fundamental objection to reprocessing—the separation of plutonium from spent power reactor fuel—is that the plutonium is a nuclear explosive. Despite nuclear industry claims to the contrary, it usable for powerful nuclear weapons.Japan Times, May 31, 2017 article, one of whose authors is a weapon designer. A plant like Rokkasho can separate several tons of plutonium per year. a nuclear weapon requires only several kilograms. 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami In June 2008, several scientists stated that the Rokkasho plant is sited directly above an active geological fault line that could produce a magnitude 8 earthquake. But Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited stated that there was no reason to fear an earthquake of more than magnitude 6.5 at the site, and that the plant could withstand a 6.9 quake.Japanese nuclear plant in quake risk Nature.com, 2008Japan's nuclear facilities face quake risk After the Tōhoku earthquake (magnitude 9.1) in March 2011, the plant ran on emergency power provided by backup diesel generators. The emergency generators were not intended for long-term use. Reportedly there are about 3,000 tons of highly radioactive used nuclear fuel stored in Rokkasho at the current time. Japanese radio reported on 13 March that 600 liters of water leaked at the Rokkasho spent fuel pool. According to The New York Times, grid power was restored on 14 March 2011.

It is found in north-central Laos and Vietnam. Its range might extend into Thailand. The specific name cremnobatus is derived from Greek kremnobates, meaning \\"frequenter of steep places\\", and refers to the steep waterfall from which the type series were collected. Common name Lao sucker frog has been coined for it. Description The type series consists of two adult males measuring in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is slender, with the head wider than the body. The snout is short and almost truncate. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers are short but bear very wide discs; the medial edges of second and third fingers have distinct skin folds. The toes bear somewhat smaller discs and are fully webbed. Preserved specimens are dorsally and laterally black and have irregular, small, light markings that are yellowish brown in life. The dorsolateral folds are marked by series of short, light bars. The limbs bear wide, black crossbars. The ventral surfaces are white, sometimes with weak, black suffusion. The tadpoles are dorsally and laterally black and ventrally white. Body length is up to and total length up to . Habitat and conservation Amolops cremnobatus is closely associated with fast-flowing, rocky streams and cascades in evergreen forest at elevations of above sea level. The eggs are adhesive and deposited in clutches on wet vertical rock faces within the splash zone of cascades. The tadpoles live clinged to and climbing on the same rock faces. Although Amolops cremnobatus can live in slightly disturbed forest, it is likely to suffer from changes in hydrological conditions (e.g., damming), habitat loss caused by logging, conversion to agriculture, and the development of infrastructure. It is also collected for food. It is known from a number of protected areas: Pù Mát National Park as well as Pu Hoat and Pu Hu Nature Reserves in Vietnam, and Nakai–Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos.

Nicolas David Stacey (27 November 1927 - 8 May 2017) was a priest of the Church of England and social activist. He was Rector of Woolwich in the 1960s, and Director of Social Services for Kent County Council from 1974-1985. Early life Nick Stacey was born 27 November 1927. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and saw service on HMS Anson in the last months of the Second World War. He participated in the liberation of Hong Kong, and witnessed the devastation of Hiroshima shortly after VJ Day. He resigned his commission in the Navy to read Modern History at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and then trained for the priesthood at Cuddesdon Theological College. During this time he represented his service, university and country in athletics, being president of the Oxford University Athletics Club, and participated in the British Empire Games (1950), and the 1952 Olympic Games. He was a semi-finalist in the 200 metres and a finalist in the 4×400 metres relay. Ordained in 1953 he served his title at St Mark’s, Portsea, Portsmouth, under Christopher Pepys, later Bishop of Buckingham. In 1958 he moved to be Domestic Chaplain (personal assistant) to the Bishop of Birmingham, Dr Leonard Wilson. It was during his time in Birmingham that he began to receive national attention, founding and editing a tabloid church newspaper, the Birmingham Christian News, which gained a reputation for comparatively racy journalism and a sensationalist approach to church news. This was a deliberate policy on Stacey's part, and became characteristic of his ministry. He said \\"We want to be a platform for the prophetic voices of the country. We want to show that the Christian faith is relevant to twentieth-century living and that the Church is concerned with all the activities of man\\".Who Cares, p. 55 The \\"Woolwich Project\\" In 1960 he was invited by Mervyn Stockwood, Bishop of Southwark, to become rector of Woolwich. He remained there for eight years. When he arrived in Woolwich he found three Church of England churches with small and unrepresentative congregations. The seemingly intractable problems of poor social housing and the resistance of the working class to the established church meant that religious observance in Woolwich was declining faster than in the rest of the country. Stacey implemented a radical programme. He recruited a large multi-talented and multi-denominational team of ministers. He closed one of the three churches, and radically reordered the eighteenth-century parish church of St Mary Magdalen. The galleries and side aisles were enclosed and offices, meeting rooms, and counselling rooms were created. A discothèque was built in the crypt, and the church's youth club was so successful that local probation officers fought to get their clients accepted as members. A coffee bar was opened in the gallery. Within four year, 1500 people a week were passing through the church doors. Stacey was not without his detractors. His abrupt style and ability to garner publicity for his project alienated some of his fellow clergy in the diocese: :If Stacey thinks he can build the Kingdom of God by frying eggs on the altar and percolating coffee in the organ pipe he should think again.Who Cares, p. 114. But Stacey didn't neglect the traditional model of parochial ministry. An intensive parish visiting programme was begun, with the large clergy team visiting attempting to visit every household in the parish systematically. An adaptation of the Prayer Book baptism service was devised in an attempt to be more welcoming. Stacey fostered links with the civic bodies of the area, and encouraged links with the Royal Arsenal. Despite all this effort, after four years Stacey judged the project to have been a failure. Regular worshippers had increased from fifty to one hundred, but most of these did not live in the parish. Stacey's reaction was characteristic. He wrote two articles for The Observer in December 1964 and May 1965. In the articles which he described his \\"mission's failure\\" and recommendations for the survival of the Church of England. The articles caused a storm of publicity, and were not at all well received. Bryan Wilson, the eminent sociologist of religion, described the latter article as not “how the Church could survive” but rather “how the Church might surrender”.Observer Weekend Review, 30 May 1965. Eric Mascall called Stacey a \\"gimmick manqué\\". Undeterred, Stacey restructured his ministry team. Most of the clergy sought secular employment, working in the parish in their spare time and at weekends. Stacey himself earned most of his income through journalism. However, after another three years he realised that he was ready for a change from Woolwich parish, and, realising that the Church was unlikely to offer him another post, he began to seek secular employment. Oxfam and Social Services In 1968 Stacey was appointed Deputy Director of Oxfam, a job he stayed in for only 2 years. He felt that Oxfam was well placed to do what Bob Geldof attempted 30 years later - lead a national campaign to Make Poverty History. This would have involved educating the public on the enormity and complexity of relieving poverty in the Third World which could only be done by massive British government aid. Oxfam's trustees were afraid it would lose its charitable status and Stacey resigned. As in the Church he was ahead of his time. Stacey's next move was to become in 1971 the first Director of Social Services for the 300,000-strong population of the London Borough of Ealing. Social Service departments had been created as a result of the Seebohm report which brought together in one local government department children's and young people's services, the mentally and physically handicapped, the mentally ill and elderly to create a 'cradle to grave' caring service. It was a controversial appointment because Stacey was neither a social worker nor a local government officer. In spite of this three years later he was appointed to be Kent's Director of Social Services, one of the three largest departments in the country, with 6,000 staff caring for 50,000 clients serving a population of 1.5 million. The publication 'A Study in Leadership: Nick Stacey and Kent Social Services' written by Don Brand, published in January 2009, explains, 'Stacey inherited a department needing extensive modernisation in an authority with little appetite for change. Seen from outside, Kent was a dead-beat place. It wasn't somewhere you went to work, it wasn't cutting edge....the place was absolutely dire and in many ways it was quite brave of Nick to go there.' By the time Stacey left in 1985 he had transformed Kent into one of the leading departments in the country with a national reputation for imaginative innovation and a strong influence on government policy. He was responsible for pioneering from scratch two projects which were to become national government policy. The first was to introduce Professional Fostering for delinquent and troubled teenagers. Hitherto pre- puberty children in care were mainly fostered while teenagers were placed in institutions. Stacey was convinced that putting a lot of unloved, insecure, often delinquent and troubled teenagers together exacerbated their problems while the institutionsto which they were sent became springboards for borstal and prison. Carefully selected and well supported professional foster parents were paid a fee so that if a married couple fostered two youngsters they would earn for a very demanding job the equivalent of a teacher's annual salary. Foster care fees cost about half what it costs to keep a youngster in an institution. Professional Fostering was a great success and was introduced nationwide. The second scheme, monitored from the start by the University of Kent, was Community Care for the Elderly. Instead of sending old people unable to care for themselves into old people's homes, each old person was individually assessed to see what services they would require in order to stay in their own homes. A package of care tailored to each old person's particular needs - from getting them up in the morning to putting them to bed at night and providing a daily meal - was provided by social work staff. Very often it was cheaper than the cost of care in an old people's home. Stacey's Legacy His autobiography, Who Cares, written shortly after he left the stipendiary ministry, is a trenchant and honest description of his experiences in the Church of England. Although out of print, it is occasionally available through second-hand book dealers, and is essential reading for historians of the Church of England in the twentieth century. The Woolwich Project was probably the best last chance for a traditional, intensive model of parochial ministry. Much of what Stacey pioneered has become commonplace in the Church of England (for example, his fostering of ecumenical teams and shared premises), and some of his more radical proposals (such as nine out of ten clergy working in non- stipendiary ministry) may yet be required by the Church. Summing up in his booklet on Nick Stacey's role in Social Services Don Brand says: 'Leading and managing social services requires men and women of the highest calibre with vision, intelligence and judgement. His success shows how imaginative leadership can overcome the constraints of bureaucracy.' Stacey showed the way for charismatic and dedicated people to follow in a demanding and fulfilling job. Stacey claims his work as a Director of Social Services gave him a greater opportunity of Building the Kingdom of God than he would have had if he had stayed in the ecclesiastical structures. He said: 'I accept that I have failed to have much influence on the Church but I am grateful to God to have had an opportunity to have had some influence in what has often been described as the Secular Church.' In 2005 he was awarded the Cross of St Augustine, given personally by the Archbishop of Canterbury \\"for outstanding service within the Church of England whether centrally or in the dioceses, or the Anglican Communion as a whole, and to those who have contributed to advancing relations between the various Christian communions and churches.\\" Kendall House  In 2006 Stacey was interviewed as part of the British Library’s oral history series, National Life Stories, under the title of “Pioneers of Charity and Social Welfare”.https://sounds.bl.uk/Oral- history/Sport/021M-C1155X0007XX-0001V0 In the interview about his role in the development of Social Care in Britain, Stacey revealed that during his time as Director of Social Services he did not uncover abuse that warranted referral to the police. A few weeks after Stacey died in 2017 the BBC’s Religious Affairs correspondent, Callum May, wrote an article on the BBC website that linked those remarks with Kendall House, a Church of England-run children’s home in Gravesend where vulnerable girls were routinely medicated, restrained and abused. Amongst the residents was campaigner Teresa Cooper, whose persistence across three decades led to the Kendall House review, which finally brought the full story of abuse to daylight. The independent review’s 2016 reporthttps://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/report_of_the_kendall_house_review_june_2016_0.pdf found the institution to have inadequate governance and oversight, made 19 recommendations for the Dioceses of Canterbury and Rochester and concluded that they should apologise to the women who had suffered abuse. The BBC article implied that Stacey, a Church of England parish priest in the 1960s, oversaw Kendall House and must have known of the abuse and failed to report it. A complaint to the BBC was upheld and the BBC accepted that as a Church of England home Kendall House was not overseen by Stacey, that he was not responsible for Kendall House and that it was not “unavoidable that Stacey would have known what was going on but failed to report it”. The Church Times which also ran the story published letters clarifying the mistake. The revelations of abuse at Kendall House served to underline the importance of Stacey’s pioneering role in the introduction of Professional Fostering. Professional Fostering removed vulnerable children from institutions such as Kendall House and placed them in family homes. The initiative was subsequently introduced by Social Services throughout the UK. Documents held on Kendall house show Rev Stacey was directly involved with Kendall House and had direct contact with the acting GP and social workers involved with Kendall House. Please show evidence of the previous paragraph of complaints upheld.

George Albert Boulenger described Amolops ricketti based on two specimens collected by Irish ornithologist John D. La Touche in Guadun village in Wuyishan, Fujian, China. The specific name honours Mr. C. B. Rickett, a British ornithologist active in China. Amolops ricketti is a small frog, males measuring about and females about in snout-vent length. Tadpoles are about in length. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and rivers. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Antimicrobial peptides that are candidates for developing novel anti- infection agents can be extracted from the skin secretions of Amolops ricketti.

It is at present only known from a few locations in central Vietnam—that is, it is endemic to Vietnam—but it is likely to be found more widely in the Vietnamese Central Highlands as well as in the adjacent southeastern Laos and northeastern Cambodia. The specific name spinapectoralis is derived from Latin spina for \\"thorn\\" and pectoralis for \\"of the breast\\" and refers to the pectoral spines in adult males. Common name spinyback torrent frog has been coined for it. Description Adult females measure and adult males in snout–vent length, although only males larger than SVL had nuptial pads in addition to vocal sacs. The overall appearance is stocky. The snout is obtusely pointed or rounded in dorsal view and rounded in profile. The tympanum is visible. The fingers are without webbing but bear truncate discs. The toes are fully webbed and have discs that are smaller than finger discs. Skin is dorsally granular, tuberculate on the sides, and smooth ventrally. The dorsum and head have large black spots surrounded by olive brown network. The iris is olive brown with fine black network. Males have conspicuous and bowed prepollex, nuptial pads consisting of about 100 white, conical spines, and an oval group of similar spines on each side of chest, as referred to in the specific name. Habitat and conservation Amolops spinapectoralis live in montane evergreen forests at elevations of above sea level and are associated with wet, vertical rock faces adjacent to waterfalls. Its natural history is poorly known but it is likely restricted to areas near cascades and swiftly flowing streams, as with other Amolops. Reproduction probably occurs in the same streams. This species can be very abundant locally. However, it is threatened by habitat loss and degradation caused by expanding agriculture; large areas of forest are being converted to cash crop plantations such as rubber, coffee, and tea. It is also harvested for local consumption, but it is not known whether this is a considerable threat. The species occurs in the Kon Ka Kinh National Park and Ngọc Linh Nature Reserve.

It is found in southeastern Cameroon, eastern Gabon, southwestern Central African Republic, northern Republic of the Congo, and eastward to the central Democratic Republic of the Congo, with one (doubtful) record from Angola; it might occur in Equatorial Guinea. Common names Masako ball frog and Masako fishing frog have been coined for this species. Its distinctness from Aubria subsigillata has been debated, but at present it is treated as a valid species. Description Adult males measure in snout–vent length; females are larger The maximum length is about . The tympanum is large and distinct, and the supratympanic fold is present. The finger and toe tips are rounded but not enlarged. The fingers have only some dermal fringes, whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum is brown and has dark speckles. A white or off- white vertebral line may be present. The underside is speckled white over a brown background, turning almost entirely white in older individuals (the exception being from the throat). Both sexes have conspicuous yellow-brown femoral glands close to the knee. Habitat and ecology Aubria masako occurs in swamps or along small streams in lowland forests, gallery forests, and degraded secondary habitats (farm bush) in the forest zone. Breeding takes places in standing water, in pools, swamps, and marshes. It is nocturnal, burrowing in mud when inactive. The diet consists of—somewhat unusually for an amphibian—of fish (e.g., Epiplatys), but also of arthropods and other amphibians, including younger conspecifics. Conservation Although it is considered an adaptable species, in parts of its range Aubria masako is only known from pristine habitats. Nevertheless, this species is not considered to face any significant threats. It is presumably to be found in several protected areas.

It has a discontinuous distribution from southern Guinea through Liberia and Ivory Coast, and from Nigeria to southern Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea to Gabon (with, at least apparently, a gap in Togo and Benin). However, the species delimitation differs between sources (see below), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has adopted a narrower view where this species only occurs in Cameroon and southward. Taxonomy The species currently known as A. subsigillata might represent more than one species. While the Amphibian Species of the World considers A. occidentalis as a synonym of A. subsigillata, other sources recognize it as a valid species. Furthermore, what some sources treat as Aubria occidentalis is actually another species, Aubria masako. Etymology The specific name subsigillata is derived from Latin sub, meaning under, and sigillatus, for ornamented with small marks, in reference to the speckled underside of this species. Description A. subsigillata is a large, stocky frog; males measure and females in snout–vent length. Apart from size, the males and females are quite similar. The dorsum is brown, whereas the underside is speckled white over a brown background; in older individuals, much of the underside is white. The tympanum is relatively small but visible. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats are swamps or along small streams in lowland rainforests, gallery forests, and degraded secondary habitats (farm bush) in the forest zone.

This frog can be found throughout the Solomon Islands archipelago (both in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville of Papua New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands, an independent state), except for San Cristobal. Ceratobatrachus guentheri Cornufer guentheri is abundant throughout the Solomon Islands where it can be found on the forest floor in tropical rain forests; it can also live in secondary forests, rural gardens, and in other modified habitats. They average about in length, with females being larger than the males. Their cryptic coloration and dorsal patterns aid in their camouflage—often mimicking decaying leaf matter—giving rise to the common name of \\"leaf frog\\". They are an interesting example of a species that undergoes direct development—there is no free-living tadpole stage; instead, the juvenile emerges from the egg as a fully developed froglet. Eggs are laid in small hollows at the base of trees. They grow rapidly from a long froglet on a diet of tiny insects until they can take the adult diet of insects, arthropods, smaller amphibians and small reptiles. They are ambush predators, pouncing quickly on any prey animals that happen to wander within their reach – including their own species.

This was the first album to show how West changed her style and sound. Her material began to get sexier and riskier, and her music was more uptempo, and more pop-sounding as well. In late 1976, the title track single was released and hit No. 19 on the Billboard Country charts in 1977, bringing West back with a decent hit, after being in a dry spell over the past two years. The song also showed off West's new style, among other recordings in this album.

There he first became associated with the YMCA serving as chairman of the Boys' Work Committee and later developing their first camping program. In 1898, he was hired as the Boys' Work Secretary by the Massachusetts-Rhode Island State Committee. While working for the YMCA in Massachusetts he attended the YMCA Training School, now Springfield College. Robinson was appointed the Boys' Work Secretary of the International Committee in 1900. According to one history, \\"at the time, there were twenty Boys' Work Secretaries and 30,000 boys as members nationwide. Thirteen years later, there were 363 secretaries with over 120,000 youth in membership.\\" Robinson developed camping programs, father and son programs, sex education programs, specialized work with employed boys and wartime programs.\\" Boy Scouts of America During the years 1908 and 1909, Scout troops were starting almost sponteneously in locations across the United States, before the BSA existed, but following the publication of Scouting for Boys by Sir Robert Baden-Powell. A handful of YMCA centers were hosting troops, so Edgar Robinson had an interest in helping the BSA get off the ground so that his organization and others would have American-based resources for troop leaders. In April 1910, Edgar Robinson persuaded William D. Boyce to appoint him managing director of the BSA for a limited time period, during which time Robinson secured a number of leading citizens to join together to form the Executive Board of the BSA. He then relinquished his role in BSA affairs, with the executive role eventually going to the newly recruited James E. West. Robinson was recognized for his work in establishing the BSA with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926. Robinson remained \\"the preeminent figure in YMCA boys' work until his retirement in 1927.\\" In 2000 he was inducted into the YMCA Hall of Fame at Springfield College.

Design and development In response to a United States Army Air Service Pursuit Alert (Special) requirement for an interceptor aircraft, Dayton-Wright Airplane Company designed an aircraft with the Army designation PS-1. Using many of the same advanced features of the earlier Dayton-Wright RB-1 Racer developed for the 1920 Gordon Bennett race. The racing aircraft had a pilot cockpit entirely enclosed in the streamlined fuselage. Construction consisted of a wooden semimonocoque fuselage with the cantilever wing constructed entirely of wood and fitted with leading- and trailing-edge flaps. The XPS-1 differed from its predecessor in having a parasol monoplane configuration with wooden flying surfaces whose fuselage was a fabric-covered steel-tube structure. The main design feature retained from the RB Racer was its retractable undercarriage. The unusual design for the time was a tailskid undercarriage with the main units designed to retract into the lower fuselage sides. The landing gear was hand-operated using a chain-and-sprocket system. It could be raised in 10 seconds and lowered in six seconds. Three aircraft were ordered as the XPS-1, one was used for ground tests while the remainder were slated for flight trials. Operational history Test flights began in 1923 but the performance was so poor the United States Army Air Service refused to accept the design. The three examples remained the only type produced for the PS category.

It is found in Togo and Ghana. Common name Togo slippery frog has been coined for this species. Even feared to be extinct, a few populations were found in surveys in 2005–2007, after the species had gone unrecorded for more than 20 years. Etymology The specific name derooi honours , a Belgian ornithologist who was part of the expedition that discovered the species. Distribution Conraua derooi is found in southwestern Togo and adjacent southeastern Ghana on the Togo-Volta Highlands, as well as in the Atewa Range in central Ghana. Records of Conraua alleni from eastern Ghana and Togo refer to this species. The type locality is (=Misahöhe) in western Togo. Description Conraua derooi are large frogs (though much smaller than their relative, the goliath frog Conraua goliath), with males measuring and females about in snout–vent length. The head is relatively large with prominent eyes and a fairly small snout. The tympanum is not visible externally. The hindlimbs are very long and robust. The toes are long and have distinct adhesive discs and webbing extending midway to the discs. The forelimbs are short but muscular with webbed fingers. Habitat and conservation Conraua derooi lives in flowing water in forest habitats; they are permanently aquatic. The tadpoles develop in streams. At the time of the latest assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2004, only one surviving population was believed to exist. However, surveys in 2005–2007 located a few populations in Ghana and Togo, after the species had gone unrecorded for more than 20 years. Nevertheless, the species is extremely threatened by habitat destruction and alteration, as well as by human consumption. Further, there is genetic differentiation between the Atewa and Volta populations. Populations within the Atewa Range Forest Reserve seem large and viable; these are probably the largest remaining populations.

Matrimonial law is based on the millet or confessional community system employed in the Ottoman Empire, which was not modified during the British Mandate and remains in force in the State of Israel. In addition to the respective faiths of Jewish, Muslim, and Druze communities in Israel, Israel recognizes ten distinct denominations of Christianity. Marriages in each community are under the jurisdiction of their own religious authorities. The religious authority for Jewish marriages performed in Israel is the Chief Rabbinate of Israel and the Rabbinical courts. The Israeli Interior Ministry registers marriages on presentation of proper documentation. Israel's religious authorities — the only entities authorized to perform weddings in Israel — are prohibited from marrying couples unless both partners share the same religion. Therefore, interfaith couples can be legally married in Israel only if one of the partners converts to the religion of the other. However, civil, interfaith, and same-sex marriages entered into abroad are recognized by the state.Michel Chabin 2013-06-13 Married On The Mediterranean — But Not In Israel The Jewish Week. Retrieved 2015-10-01 Over 50 percent of Israelis marry before age 25, with marriage rates much higher among Orthodox Jews and Muslims than among secular Jews, according to statistics released on 18 June 2019 by the Central Bureau of Statistics. History Under the Ottoman Empire, all matters of a religious nature and personal status, which included marriage, were within the jurisdiction of Muslim courts and the courts of other recognized religions, called confessional communities, under a system known as millet. Capitulation Treaties also permitted the registration of marriages and divorces in the British, German, American, and other consulates during the Ottoman period. Jewish religious matters were handled by the Hakham Bashi and the Jewish courts. Article 14 of the British Mandate of Palestine required the mandatory administration to establish a commission to study, define, and determine the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. Article 15 required the mandatory administration to see to it that complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship were permitted. Those mandates were never enforced or put into effect. The High Commissioner established the Orthodox Rabbinate, and retained a modified millet system that recognized eleven religious communities: Sunni Islam, Orthodox Judaism, and nine Christian denominations. All those who were not members of these recognised communities were excluded from the millet arrangement, and \\"marriages\\" conducted in Palestine outside these communities were not recognised. Consular marriages remained customary during the British Mandate and civil divorces granted in other countries were registered and recognized by the mandatory administration. Provision was made for the registration of marriages, but not for the manner in which marriages would be conducted. Jewish community Jewish wedding in Israel, early 1950s In 1947, David Ben-Gurion and the religious parties reached an agreement that included an understanding that matters of personal status in Israel, which included marriage, would continue to be determined by religious authorities. This arrangement has been termed the status quo agreement and has been maintained, despite numerous changes of government since. Under the arrangement, the Mandate period confessional system would continue, with membership in the Jewish community being on the basis of membership of a body called \\"Knesset Israel\\", which was a voluntary organization that managed registrations of people who were related to it — that is, those recognised as Jews. There does not seem to have been any dispute at the time of who was a Jew. However, in 1953 rabbinical courts were established under the jurisdiction of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel with jurisdiction over marriage and divorce for all Jews in Israel. The rabbinate's standards and interpretations in these matters are generally used by the Israeli Interior Ministry in registering marriages and divorces. Halakhic restrictions on marriage are applied in Israel. So, for example, a kohen may not marry a convert to Judaism. Similarly, children of adulterous and incestuous unions are restricted as to whom they can marry. Orthodox halachic rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow halachic standards to be recognised as valid. Non-Orthodox conversions are not recognized, as are some Orthodox conversions that do not meet the requirements of the Chief Rabbinate. For example, a man who converted to Orthodox Judaism in the United States was denied an official marriage in Israel because the Orthodox rabbi who converted him is not recognized in Israel. If a person's Jewish status is in doubt, then formal conversion is required in order to be allowed to marry according to the Orthodox rules, which govern all marriages between Jews in Israel. This frequently occurs with Jews from the former Soviet Union as well as Ethiopian Jews. In order to marry, Jewish couples must attend classes on family purity, even if they are not religious.Mazie, Steven V. \\"Changing Israel’s Marriage Law\\" The Jewish Week In October 2013, the Tzohar Law was passed, allowing for Jews to choose any rabbi recognized by the Chief Rabbinate instead of being required to be married by their community rabbi. In 2015, Tzohar (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israeli Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a get; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation. It remains a criminal offense for Jews in Israel to marry in weddings performed outside the state’s religious authority, and doing so can result in a jail sentence of up to two years. Hiddush ranked Israel as the only Western democracy that is on a par with Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and other Islamic states in relation to freedom of marriage. In 2019, it was reported that there was a growing trend for Israeli couples to get married in Israel outside of the Rabbinate's jurisdiction. There was a consistent growth in the number of couples marrying outside of the Rabbinate, while a drop in the number of couples marrying within the Rabbinate. Muslim community Most Israeli Muslims are Sunnis. In 1922, the British created the Supreme Muslim Council as the Muslim religious authority in the British Mandate of Palestine and appointed Amin al-Husayni (1895–1974) as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The council was abolished in 1948 by Jordan, but was reconstituted in Jerusalem after the Six-Day War in 1967. Muslim marriages are conducted in accordance with sharia law. Inter-faith marriages are permitted only between Muslim men and Christian or Jewish women, who are considered Muslims after the wedding. A Muslim woman may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source. Christian churches There are nine officially recognised churches for the purposes of marriage. These are the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic (Latin rite), Armenian Apostolic, Armenian Catholic, Syriac Catholic, Chaldean (Uniate), Melkite Greek Catholic, Maronite and Syriac Orthodox churches. In 1970, the Anglican Church was included with these recognised churches. At the same time, special arrangements for the recognition of marriage were made between the State of Israel and the Lutheran, Ethiopian Orthodox, and Coptic Orthodox churches. Christians may seek official separations or divorces, depending on the denomination, through ecclesiastical courts. Druze community The Druze community was recognized as a separate community from the Muslim community in 1957. In 1962, separate Druze courts were established to deal with personal status issues in the Druze community, alongside the rabbinical courts, the Sharia courts, and the courts of the Christian communities.Druze in israel, דרוזים בישראל: היבט היסטורי ומרחבי , liat ytzhak, e-mago magazine, 1998 Civil regulations In 2013, the minimum marriage age in Israel was raised to 18, from a previous age of 17.Times of Israel, 4 November 2013: Israel raises minimum marriage age from 17 to 18Ynetnews.com, 11.4.13: Knesset raises marriage age to 18. Previously, the marriage age was 18 for males and 17 for females,Ottoman Law of Family Rights 1917 for males and Age of Marriage Law 1950 for females before they were equalised at 17 years. The Israeli Supreme Court affirmed that marital rape is a crime in a 1980 decision, citing law based on the Talmud.David Kauzlarich, Introduction to Criminology, 2008, p. 79. Rape, including spousal rape, is now a felony in Israel, punishable by 16 years in prison. Under the Penal Law Amendment (Bigamy) Law, 5719 (1959), it is illegal to marry in Israel while currently married, regardless of religion.The English Law of Bigamy in a Multi-Confessional Society: The Israel Experience by P Shifman. Since 1977, attempting to take a second spouse can be punished by up to five years in jail, although the law is rarely enforced. Polygyny is nevertheless still practiced by Muslim Negev Bedouins; according to a 2013 Knesset report, 30% of Negev Bedouin men have more than one wife. Some Bedouin men use nominal divorces or unrecognized marriages with women who are not Israeli citizens in order to circumvent the law. In 2017, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked began a crackdown against the practice. Out of more than 300 cases investigated in 2018, 16 men were indicted for polygamy.  Partial recognition of civil marriage  In 1951, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that marriages entered into outside Israel conducted by a rabbinical court in accordance with halakha must be recognized in Israel. The case before the court involved a couple who were not residents or citizens of Israel at the time of their marriage. However, commentators have noted that the case did not deal with a situation where one or both of the couple were residents or citizens of Israel, nor with a civil marriage abroad. The issue of recognition of civil marriages is of special significance in Judaism because Orthodox Judaism has various prohibitions involving marriages. The couples in these prohibited marriage situations sometimes marry overseas, mostly in Cyprus, which is near Israel.Getting Married in Israel: Why It So Often Means Hiring a Detective, Daniel Estrin, The Atlantic, February 13, 2013. In 1962, the Supreme Court determined that the Ministry of the Interior must register as married couples who married in a civil marriage abroad, even if either or both of the couple were citizens of Israel. The act of registration is for statistical purposes only, and not a recognition of the personal status of the couple, as registration does not determine the validity of the marriage. In 2006, the Supreme Court voted 6-1 to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other countries. Overseas marriages are increasingly popular, with roughly 9,000 couples registering overseas marriages with the Central Bureau of Statistics in 2011 alone.\\"Israel Couples Say 'I Don't' to Orthodox Marriage — Opt for Civil Ceremonies.\\" The Forward. 20 November 2013. 1 July 2015. In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law for Citizens with no Religious Affiliation, 2010, allowing a couple to form a civil union in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion. The issue of civil marriages is a major issue for secular Jews and members of non-Orthodox streams of Judaism, who are required to meet the Orthodox standards to be able to marry in Israel. According to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, more than 98% of Israelis are married to a partner of the same religion. 97% of Jews would be uncomfortable if their child married a Muslim and 89% would be uncomfortable if their child married a Christian. The vast majority of secular Jews oppose interfaith marriage. Divorce The 1973 Spouses' Property Relations Act officially defined what assets would be divided after divorce or if one of the spouses dies, unless they both agreed beforehand. An amendment was later added to the 1973 law in 2008 to ensure that property would be divided equally among both spouses before the divorce rather than after. The divorce process in Israel for married people of Jewish faith is administered by the Get Procedure and finalized by Rabbinical Judges. On 15 November 2016, the Get Procedure was officially regulated after State Attorney Shai Nitzan required criminal prosecution of men or women who refuse to grant or accept a divorce after being instructed to do so by a rabbinical court, although some said it would not have a dramatic impact since criminal proceedings will only be possible if the rabbinical court issues a rarely used ruling obligating a spouse to agree to the divorce. , the number of Jewish divorces granted per year has been increasing; 11,145 couples divorced in 2018. Israeli Jewish couples who marry in civil ceremonies outside Israel must divorce via the rabbinical courts. In 2018 the Knesset passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither spouse is an Israeli citizen. Under the nation's Capacity and Guardianship Law, child custody is almost always granted to the mother following a divorce. In 2012, however, an amendment was added to the law to ensure that both the father and any child of the divorced parents who is at least six years of age would share equal rights as the mother as state- appointed social workers determine child custody. The age of the child with equal privilege was later lowered to two in 2013.

Most states offer Voluntary Disclosure Agreements to encourage companies to comply with a state's tax laws and in turn generate revenue for the state that it may not have had if the company did not come forward and disclose its liabilities. Additionally, the state can generate future revenue by having a company register in their state to collect and remit certain taxes. Benefits The primary benefits of a voluntary disclosure typically include: *Limitations of the prior look-Back period - Usually the look-back period is limited to between 3 and 5 years as opposed to having no statute of limitations if no return has ever been filed. However, for the offshore voluntary disclosure program, there is an 8-year look back period. In some cases prospective agreements can be reached in which the taxpayer is forgiven of all past liabilities, but agrees to future compliance. *Abatement of penalties - Most states will waive penalties on any prior period taxes that are remitted in connection with a voluntary disclosure agreement. *Full or partial interest\\\\- A limited number of states will abate interest in full. Many states apply a reduced interest rate to prior period taxes remitted in connection with a voluntary disclosure agreement. *Friendlier sales and use tax audit - While state taxing authorities typically reserve the right to audit taxpayers who come forward pursuant to a voluntary disclosure agreement, the audit will typically be limited to the reduced look-back period, and it would generally focus more on understanding and confirming the reasonableness of the taxpayer's liability quantification approach, rather than on uncovering additional liabilities. *Brings closure to prior periods - The taxpayer will be comfortable knowing that prior period liabilities are closed and will be able to concentrate its compliance efforts on current and future periods. *Protects potential buyers from prior ownership's liabilities. Disadvantages *Cost - The main disadvantage of this alternative is the cost. This alternative usually requires the assistance of a third party service provider who will require a fee for their services and the compliance cost might outweigh the benefits (i.e. if the potential exposure is not material). *Compliance burden - The taxpayer will have an increased compliance burden immediately and going forward, as they will now be required to remit and report taxes.

The domesticated Thai variety and wild Chinese populations of H. rugulosus belong to two separate genetic lineages respectively.Yu D, Zhang J, Li P, Zheng R, Shao C (2015) Do Cryptic Species Exist in Hoplobatrachus rugulosus?

(2015) suggest that H. rugulosus may in fact be a cryptic species complex. Description H. rugulosus is a large, robust frog, up to or more in snout-vent length. Females are larger than males. They are primarily insectivores. Regional names The Chinese edible frog is commonly referred to as 田雞 (\\"field chicken\\") or 虎皮蛙 (\\"tiger- skinned frog\\") in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Chinese communities worldwide. In Filipino, they are called \\"palakang bukid,\\" which means \\"frog of the field.\\" Usage The frogs are commonly found in wet markets, seafood markets, and pet stores. In wet markets, they are usually sold per piece or per kilogram. The medium-sized frogs are sold as pets in pet stores, and the smaller variant is sold as live food for arowanas. They are widely farmed in Sichuan, China, Malaysia, and Thailand. These frogs, though much smaller than their Western counterparts, are used by Chinese to cook frog legs and by Filipinos who cook them using the adobo method. The frog's forelimbs and hind legs are fried in oil, while in the adobo method (in which the entire frog is utilized), they are cooked in soy sauce and vinegar.

The head city of the canton is San Marcos. It is part of Los Santos Zone, together with Dota and León Cortés Castro.  Geography  Pacific Ocean in the distance, as see from Tarrazú Tarrazú has an area of km² and a mean elevation of metres. The Pirrís River (also known as Parrita River) establishes much of the northern boundary of the three-pronged canton, which reaches south across the Coastal Mountain Range to its border with the canton of Aguirre in Puntarenas Province. Tarrazu is located about 70 kilometers south of the Capital San Jose, in a pristine valley surrounded by mountains that are part of the Talamanca Sierra in southern Costa Rica. Downtown San Marcos is 1350 meters above sea level but is surrounded by peaks as high as 3000 meters above sea level. Districts The canton of Tarrazú is subdivided into three districts: # San Marcos # San Lorenzo # San Carlos History The canton was established by a legislative decree of 7 August 1868. It was part of the Desamparados canton by that time.  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Tarrazú had a population of inhabitants.  Transportation   Road transportation  The canton is covered by the following road routes: Economy Highland coffee is the main source of income of local people. However, tourism and avocado production are of increased importance. During the months of December, January and February, population increases three-fold due to harvest time. San Marcos, the biggest town in the region, has become the center of economic activity. More recently the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity has invested millions of dollars in the Pirris Hydro Dam, scheduled to start generating energy by March 2011. The Hydro Dam is now the highest structure of its kind in Central America and will be key to the economic development of the region, not only in the highlands but the coastal regions of Quepos and Parrita. The region is deeply dependent on remittances from emigres who live in the United States, namely New Jersey. Few households in the region do not have a family member who lives and works in the United States. Ironically, this outmigration has led to an influx of thousands of Panamanian laborers to help realize the annual coffee harvest.Kordick, Carmen.

It was originally described in genus Huia. Its type locality is Xe Sap National Biodiversity Conservation Area in southern Laos. Description Adult males in the type series measure and adult females in snout–vent length (based on respectively 2 and 3 specimens). The overall appearance is moderately slender. The head is narrow and the snout is projecting and obtusely pointed; rounded in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct. The finger and toe tips are expanded to discs; the toes are almost fully webbed. Coloration is dorsally beige with light green flecking; there is pinkish wash on upper sides, forelimbs, and lips. Black spotting is present on the dorsal surface of snout tip, lips, upper eyelids, forelimbs, dorsolateral folds, and flanks. Black streaks run below edge of canthus from tip of snout to eye, obliquely from eye to commisure of jaws, and from eye along supratympanic fold to posterior rim of tympanum, continuing obliquely to shoulder. The limbs have brown crossbars. The venter and undersides of limbs are creamy-yellow. The iris is coppery and has a dark red blotch anterior and posterior to the pupil. Males have a subgular vocal sac. Habitat and conservation This species is known from hilly evergreen and mixed forests at elevations of above sea level. It is associated with swiftly flowing, clear rocky streams, but specimens have also been recorded away from water. They are typically found above the ground in forest vegetation. Breeding probably involves free-living tadpoles developing in streams. Odorrana absita occurs in a number of protected areas. Outside very well protected areas, it is probably suffering from habitat loss and degradation caused by conversion of forest to agricultural land to grow cash crop plantations such as rubber, coffee, and tea.

It is known with certainty only from its type locality, the eponymous Mengyang in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, southern Yunnan province of China. However, if Amolops daorum is its junior synonym, distribution of Amolops mengyangensis would be considerably wider, including the vicinity of Sa Pa in northern Vietnam near the Chinese border, Hong Kong, and Houaphanh Province in eastern Laos, and presumably also including the intervening areas. This more inclusive species circumscription was taken in the latest assessment of this species for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species from 2008. Taxonomy Amolops mengyangensis was described in 1995 based on two males and one female collected in 1957 from Yunnan. The specimens had previously been reported as Amolops chunganensis, and this view was maintained by some later authors. Rana daorum was described in 1995 based on specimens from northern Vietnam. In 2007, Ohler concluded that Rana daorum is a junior synonym of Amolops mengyangensis, but this conclusion was challenged by Stuart, Biju, and others who considered it valid as Amolops daorum. As of late 2018, the Amphibian Species of the World and AmphibiaWeb databases recognize both Amolops mengyangensis and Amolops daorum as valid species. Description Males measure in snout–vent length, whereas females can reach in snout–vent length. The snout is long and blunt. The tympanum is distinct and large. The hind limbs are long.

Retrieved on 2 August 2007. − 4 March 1980) was an English football administrator for the Football League, a wartime Royal Navy officer, and previously an amateur footballer. He was born in Hull, Yorkshire, second son to John and Emma, and younger brother of Ernest. Education and early career Alan Hardaker's education began at Constable Street Elementary School in Hull, and from there he was awarded a scholarship to Riley High School, leaving in 1928 with qualifications in typing and shorthand. He initially went into the family removals and haulage business, until 1929, when he was sacked by his own father for playing dominoes instead of working. He was able to use his qualifications to find immediate employment as an office junior in the Town Clerk's department at the Guildhall, Kingston upon Hull. He met Irene Mundy when he was seventeen and she a year younger. They married eight years later in North Ferriby Church. They would go on to have four daughters and many grandchildren. He had first taken up playing football at the High School, and so joined Municipal Sports F.C., the Guildhall team. He was sent off on one occasion during his time with them, for retaliation. Playing in the centre forward position, he scored one hundred goals in three seasons, although he claimed that most of these were only possible due to the quality of those playing alongside him. After moving on to East Riding County League champions Beverley White Star F.C. (now defunct), he was invited by Hull City to play for their reserve side against Bradford Park Avenue's second string. He had been converted to full back by this time, and that was the position he took up for Hull City Reserves. From then on, he played for one or other of the teams on a regular basis for the next three seasons. In 1935, he captained the East Riding County FA representative team when they won the Northern Counties Amateur Championship. He was offered professional terms in 1936 by manager Jack Hill, which he turned down, as by the age of 23 he had progressed to become Lord Mayor's secretary at the Guildhall. After then playing 11 games for the Reserves in the Midland League, and coinciding with a change in team management, he was released by the club. He went on to play for Bridlington Central United (later known as Bridlington Town) of the East Riding Amateur League, and then moved to the Yorkshire Amateur Football Club in the Yorkshire League. Second World War Both his sporting career and his professional life were interrupted by the imminent outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, and in his official capacity as Lord Mayor's secretary he was asked to help start the Humber Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in readiness for hostilities. He joined them on 12 June 1939, as a payroll lieutenant initially assigned to the light cruiser moored in Hull docks. However, after the war began, he was transferred to ,War history of HMS Newcastle, which Hardaker served on: hms-newcastle.co.uk website. Retrieved on 4 August 2007. based at Scapa Flow, and saw service on the \\"Northern Patrol\\", which protected convoys of Allied ships from German vessels sent to attack. In 1942, after subsequently serving on , he became a lieutenant commander, and transferred, this time to the de-commissioned torpedo training ship secured at Eastbourne. He then received a posting to Australia as supply officer to HMS Alert, a shore-based camp in Sydney, and in December 1944 moved on to HMS Golden Hind, a Royal Navy manning depot, also in Sydney. Whilst in that country, he was able to find the time to resume his sporting career, captaining the Royal Navy football side in organised matches for a single season. Hardaker remained in Australia until the end of the war, eventually deciding to retire from playing at the age of 34. Post-war career For a short while after returning to Great Britain, Hardaker fulfilled the temporary position of clerk to the Education Committee back at the Guildhall, due to his previous job being already occupied. When he was refused permission to resume his post as Lord Mayor's secretary in Hull, he applied for an identical appointment in Portsmouth, and was successful at interview. He and his young family moved there in August 1946. In 1950, he was removed from the active list of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve at his own request. In 1951, the then Portsmouth manager, Bob Jackson, got in touch with Hardaker to say that Fred Howarth, the Football League secretary, was considering retiring from the job, and recommended that he apply. Vernon Stokes, the chairman of Portsmouth F.C. at that time, also urged him to put in for it. Stokes later became chairman of the Football Association Disciplinary Committee. Seen to be answering an advertisement in the Daily Telegraph newspaper inviting applications, he duly submitted his curriculum vitae to the then Football League headquarters in Starkie Street, Preston, Lancashire. The Management Committee of the League drew up a shortlist of six candidates, which included Alan Hardaker, from an initial response of 410 applicants. On 1 May 1951, he accepted the invitation to replace Howarth, although this was not to formally happen for another five and a half years, due to the seeming reluctance of the outgoing secretary to actually retire. Hardaker took up a junior position during this period, at a much reduced salary and receiving only a small pay rise each year thereafter. He later indicated in his autobiography that he felt \\"badly let down by Arthur Drewry\\", the League President at that time. Eventually, on 5 July 1955, a little more than four years after he had been taken on, he was confirmed as assistant secretary to Fred Howarth. Hardaker had used the intervening time to read every archived document since 1888 which related to the League and its business, and was better prepared to take on the top job. On New Year's Eve in 1956, Howarth deposited his work keys on Alan Hardaker's desk and left the building for the last time, after 23 years service. On 6 January 1957 Hardaker was appointed by the Management Committee as the new Football League secretary. As Football League secretary One major change which took place at the Football League two years after Hardaker's appointment was a shift in location for the organisation's headquarters. The Starkie Street premises were little more than a converted town house, and the incoming League President at that time, Joe Richards, decided to ask Hardaker to look for more appropriate offices outside Preston. The unanimous choice, after consideration of Blackpool and Leamington Spa as possibilities, was the former Sandown Hotel in Clifton Drive, Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, and this was purchased for £11,000. Hardaker was heavily involved in the six month renovation of the building to make it suitable for purpose, and this was completed at a total cost of £40,000. The previous premises sold for £3,250. When Hardaker first joined the staff of the League, they numbered six as full-time employees. As a measure of the expansion and diversification achieved during his time as secretary, by 1977 this had increased to 25. He enjoyed the complete confidence of the Management Committee, and was delegated by them many powers to act independently concerning certain matters. In his autobiography, he claims that, due to this measure of autonomy, he was perceived as \\"arrogant and high-handed\\" and had \\"frequently been called a dictator\\" by some club officials. He maintained, though, that his one aim in football had always been to \\"see the League prosper\\". Following the passing of the Copyright Act 1956, he suggested to the Management Committee that the lists of League fixtures published each year should be subject to copyright for use by companies such as football pools promoters. He was duly given the go-ahead to implement a test case against Littlewoods Pools in 1959,League fixtures copyright case, 1959: mention in a Guardian Unlimited website article. Retrieved on 16 November 2013. and this the League won, meaning that a source of income would be secured for the clubs, as the Pools companies now needed to pay for the privilege of printing the fixtures on their coupons. Hardaker was also required to attend the House of Commons in London to address members of Parliament regarding the ending of the maximum wage for football players, which Jimmy Hill, the ex-Fulham player and then chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, had led a campaign for. The PFA won their members' pay freedom in 1961.Abolishing the 'maximum wage' (1961), and the retained transfer system (1963): The Independent website. Retrieved on 16 November 2013. However, this did not affect the transfer system, which still allowed clubs to retain players, even when their contracts had expired. When an application to the High Court was made in June 1963, submitted by the out- of-contract Newcastle United player George Eastham, Hardaker was called to give evidence. Despite him arguing in favour of the contract structure as it then was (the League Management Committee had instructed him in how he should proceed), the case was lost, and thereafter the players could move more easily from club to club. Hardaker was instrumental in designing the 1957 \\"Pattern of Football\\", which would have seen the existing 92 clubs, then occupying the four divisions of the League, increased to 100, with 20 teams in each of five divisions. The purpose of this was to reduce the number of weeks in the football season, allowing for less fixture congestion. At the same time, there would be more opportunity to accommodate extra competitions, such as the Football League Cup, which had been introduced during the 1960-61 season. The proposal was defeated after a vote by the member clubs, and the Pattern was discarded.Explanation of the Pattern of Football (1957), and the beginnings of the League Cup (1960): The Independent website, via the FindArticles.com service. Retrieved on 3 August 2007. Although it is widely reported that the League Cup was Alan Hardaker's idea, in his autobiography he actually gives the credit to Sir Stanley Rous, who was at that time secretary of the Football Association. He relates the tale of the Post-War Reconstruction Committee, which was a joint exercise by the FA and League to help regenerate football in England at the end of the Second World War. Sir Stanley apparently designed a separate knockout competition, to be entered by those clubs beaten in the early rounds of the FA Cup proper, but the plan was never approved. It was this idea, in tandem with the blueprint of the already-implemented Scottish League Cup north of the border, which prompted Hardaker to formulate the English League Cup. The Press were not kind to Hardaker when the League Cup was first announced. He openly admits that the proposed competition received criticism not only from Fleet Street, but from the League clubs themselves - entry into the competition was not compulsory, and Arsenal, Luton Town, Sheffield Wednesday, West Bromwich Albion, Wolves and Tottenham Hotspur all refused to participate during the inaugural season. However, the signing of TV contracts for the 1961-62 competition, and the money this would generate, helped persuade many of the abstainers to take part the following year, although various clubs still declined to enter each year. The award by UEFA of a European cup competition place for the winner of the League Cup each year, plus the attraction of Wembley as a final venue, were also strong incentives for all the clubs to join, and this was achieved by 1967. A much-quoted line from Alan Hardaker goes: \\"The FA Cup is football's Ascot, the League Cup its equivalent of Derby Day at Epsom\\".Quotation of Hardaker's horseracing analogy when referring to the two major Cup competitions in England: Yorkshire Post. Retrieved on 4 August 2007. Hardaker was asked to give advice to the League clubs when they were ordered by the FA in 1965 to sign statutory declarations regarding payments to amateur players - in other words, to guarantee that no illegal dealings were being entered into, and thus leaving themselves legally vulnerable. His advice consisted of a recommendation that they (the League clubs) resign from the Football Association \\"as a matter of extreme urgency\\", in order to force the FA to back down on the issue. Having held a meeting in Manchester, they duly handed in their resignations, all except for a few unnamed clubs. After a meeting between the Football League Management Committee and the FA in London, the demand for professional clubs to sign the declarations was withdrawn, and it was decided that only amateur clubs would be required to do so. The resignations were ignored. In 1970, when a group of Midlands club chairmen proposed that the Football League handle its own disciplinary affairs, Hardaker was asked by them if this would be possible under FA regulations. He pointed out Association Rule 1(b), which gave provision for the game to be administered for amateur and professional clubs separately. This meant that the League could have full control of its own administration, but would stop short of a breakaway from the FA. Although the Rule was never implemented, when the League Management Committee brought the matter up with the FA, they were able to negotiate many concessions, both financial and in terms of the disciplinary system, which changed as a result. Many other incidents of note came under his influence during his time as Football League secretary. In 1969, he was asked to comment on the planned introduction of pensions for those professional players over 35 years of age - he claimed that the reported comment \\"I wouldn't hang a dog on the evidence of people like that\\" was actually in answer to the proposal that former professional footballers should sit on disciplinary committees, and not about pensions. At the start of the 1971-72 season, the League Management Committee issued a directive reminding referees of their obligations regarding maintaining discipline on the field of play. Unfortunately, the Committee neglected to circulate the information to the Press or the League clubs, and there was widespread confusion when referees vastly increased the number of cautions and dismissals during matches.Increase in cautions and dismissals reported, August 1971 (point 17): Bob Dunning's Rothmans Football Yearbook online archives. Retrieved on 4 August 2007. The threat of withdrawal of League clubs from the FA Cup in 1973, following an argument over the fee for televising the 1972 European Championship (qualifying) quarter-final first leg between England and West Germany, was eventually averted. Television companies made several attempts to secure contracts with the Football League to show football matches live, in 1955, 1956 and 1967, but this would never happen in Alan Hardaker's lifetime, and he offered the opinion in his book that \\"regular live football would undermine the game's health\\". Before the start of the 1974-75 season, there was even the possibility that no League football highlights would appear on television, due to the League chairmen initially rejecting a three-year deal in 1973, worth £750,000. After protracted negotiation, they finally accepted the offer. In 1976, there was friction over the handling of the player registration of ex-Manchester United and Northern Ireland international George Best, following his transfer from Los Angeles Aztecs of the United States to Fulham. It was discovered that, due to the terms of the contract and the method of registration, Aztecs might actually retain first call on the player.

Controversy Hardaker was known for his xenophobia and insular thinking. It was his decision to boycott Chelsea's attempt to enter the first ever European Cup competition in 1955 when Secretary of the Football League. His understanding of dealing with football in Europe amounted to \\"Too many wogs and Dagoes\\", which he conveyed to a Times journalist.

Retrieved on 29 March 2013. Revie and his team frequently ran foul of Hardaker's demanding fixture schedules and autocratic rule as secretary of the Football League. The acrimony between Revie and Hardaker continued when Revie took up the post as England national manager; Revie often protested bitterly to Hardaker against the Football League's rigid fixture schedules which he claimed were outdated compared to other countries and negated any effort to establish a successful national team. Later years In 1977, Hardaker published his autobiography, Hardaker of the League, which he co-wrote with former BBC Radio football correspondent Bryon Butler and in 1979 he was made director general of the Football League, continuing to serve there until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1980.

Taxonomy Taxonomic work by Robert F. Inger and Bryan L. Stuart in 2010 on Limnonectes hascheanus and L. limborgi has led to better understanding of these similar species — L. limborgi has been considered a junior synonym of L. hascheanus. While the species are morphologically similar, mainly differing in body size (L. hascheanus being smaller), they are genetically distinct. This taxonomic work has also led to redefinition of ranges of both species, and the range of L. limborgi (as presently defined) is much broader than what was reported in the latest (2004) IUCN assessment for this species when it was considered \\"Data Deficient\\". However, L. limborgi may in fact consist of several species. Life cycle Limnonectes limborgi has nidicolous development: eggs are oviposited terrestrially in a nest; the larvae hatch in the nest and are free-living but non-feeding. Male frogs attend the nest; their skin secretions might inhibit fungal or bacterial infections. This contrast to the earlier belief that Limnonectes limborgi has direct development, i.e., no free-swimming tadpole stage, and hatching as tiny full-formed frogs. Notice that this phenomenon is originally reported for L. hascheanus, but the observations came outside the range of that species, and probably apply to L. limborgi (as currently defined).

The district capital is Mongkol Borey town located around 9 kilometres south of the provincial capital of Sisophon by road. Mongkol Borey District is the southernmost district of Banteay Meanchey. The district shares a border with Battambang Province to the south. The main railway line from Phnom Penh to Poipet on the border with Thailand runs through the district from north to south. The district is easily accessed by road from Sisophon (9 km) Battambang (city) (60 km) and Siem Reap (city) (110 km). Mongkol Borey District is one of the smallest districts in Banteay Meanchey province by land area and only Serei Saophoan District is smaller. However, it has the largest district population in the province due to its central location and transport infrastructure. National Highway 5 which begins in Phnom Penh and ends at Poipet and the National railway bisect the district in parallel running from north to south. National road 160 begins near the centre of the district and runs south west into Pailin.  History  King Sisowath of Cambodia was born in Mongkol Borey (then under Siamese rule) on 7 September 1840. The history of Mongkol Borey district before the 18th century is unclear, although it is likely that it was part of Battambang Province. From the 18th century until 1907, it was part of Phra Tabong Province of Thailand. At that time the Thai controlled the area that is modern Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, Siem Reap, Pailin and Battambang provinces. Under the French-Siamese treaty of March 23, 1907, these parts of Cambodia were returned. At this time the area around Serei Sophorn was part of Serei Sophorn district of Battambang. Between 1925 and 1940 a number of new Battambang districts were created, including Mongkol Borey. In 1988 the five northern districts of Battambang were separated to form the new province of Banteay Meanchey. It is the birthplace of King Sisowath (then part of Battambang Province) who was King of Cambodia from 1904 to 1927.  Location  Mongkol Borey district lies in the south of the province and shares a border with Battambang Province. Reading from the north clockwise, Mongkol Borey borders with Serei Saophoan district to the north. The eastern border of the district is shared with Preah Netr Preah district. The Mongkol Borey River forms part of the eastern district boundary towards Preah Netr Preah.Stung Mongkol Borei Sub-Basin.

The history of the Toronto Maple Leafs spans more than a century whose origins begins with the establishment of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Toronto Maple Leafs and the NHL arose from disputes between Eddie Livingstone, owner of the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts, and the other owners of the Association. In November 1917, the Toronto Arena Company was granted a temporary franchise from the NHL, a new ice hockey league made up of the other NHA owners that had disputes with Livingstone. The franchise was later made permanent by the NHL in October 1918. Playing at Arena Gardens, the Toronto Arenas won the 1918 Stanley Cup Finals following the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season. In 1919, the club was sold to the St. Patrick Hockey Club. Under new ownership, the club was renamed the Toronto St. Patricks. Although the St. Patricks won one Stanley Cup, in 1922, the club was again put up for sale due following a series of litigations from Livingstone. The club was eventually sold to Conn Smythe in 1927, who immediately renamed the team to the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club. In an effort to finance the construction of Maple Leaf Gardens, Smythe launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL, later renamed Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment in 1998), a publicly traded management company to own both the Maple Leafs and the planned arena. The Maple Leafs played their first game at Maple Leaf Gardens in November, 1931. For most of the 1930s, the team was led by The Kid Line. The line led the Maple Leafs to win the 1932 Stanley Cup, as well as four more Stanley Cup appearances in the following six years. As a result of the Great Depression, a number of NHL franchises financially struggled, suspended operations and folded. By the 1942–43 NHL season, the Maple Leafs were one of six remaining members in the NHL. The Maple Leafs saw tremendous success during the \\"Original Six-era\\" (from the 1942–43 to the 1966–67 season), winning the Stanley Cup in 1942, 1945, 1947, 1948, and 1949. Following the Maple Leafs 1951 Stanley Cup victory, the team saw an 11-year championship drought. Prior to the 1961–62 NHL season, Conn Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in MLGL to a partnership made up of his son, Stafford Smythe, John Bassett, and Harold Ballard. The Maple Leafs found new success during the 1960s, winning the Stanley Cup in 1962, 1963, 1964, and 1967. Winning their last championship in Centennial Year prior to the 1967 NHL expansion, the Maple Leafs' drought between Stanley Cups is the longest active drought in the NHL. In 1971, Ballard secured principal ownership of MLGL. During the 1970s, the Maple Leafs saw some success, only failing to qualify for the playoffs once in the decade. However, the Maple Leafs would fail to post a winning record for 12 years, from 1980–81 to 1992–93. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the team saw a resurgence in competitive play, missing the playoffs only twice from 1993 to 2004. In February 1999, the Maple Leafs moved from Maple Leaf Gardens, to their new home arena, the Air Canada Centre. Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Maple Leafs saw a seven-year playoff drought, failing to qualify for the playoffs from the 2006 to 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs. In August 2012, BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications completed the purchase for a combined 70 percent stake in MLSE. Shortly after the end of the 2013–14 season, Brendan Shanahan was appointed the president and alternate governor of the hockey club. Early years (1917–1928) The beginnings of the Maple Leafs NHL franchise arose out of a long-running dispute between Eddie Livingstone, owner of the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts, and his fellow NHA owners, particularly Sam Lichtenhein of the Montreal Wanderers. Tempers boiled over when the NHA added a second Toronto team in 1916–17, representing the 228th Battalion of the Canadian army. The 228th was forced to withdraw its team in mid-season when the unit was called overseas. That left the NHA with an odd number of teams, and the team owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—decided to even-up the number of teams by suspending operations of the Torontos for the rest of the season. All players were given to other NHA teams for the rest of the season. At the time, the plan was to return the players to the Toronto franchise, but the rest of the league wanted Livingstone out. At the end of the season Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. However, Livingstone turned down several offers and obtained a court order to prevent the sale. By the fall of 1917, the owners of the NHA's other four clubs—the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators, and Quebec Bulldogs—were eager to disassociate themselves from Livingstone. On October 19, a meeting of the NHA board of directors was held. Livingstone did not attend, sending lawyer Eddie Barclay. Barclay was informed by the directors that Toronto would not be permitted to play in the 1917–18 season due to the difficulty of operating a five-team league, both in scheduling and availability of players during wartime. However, the NHA's constitution didn't allow the other teams to simply vote Livingstone out. Livingstone responded by publicly announcing that he would set up an international circuit and raid the NHA players. On November 9, 1917, it was reported that the Toronto NHA franchise had been sold to Charles Querrie of the Toronto Arena corporation. At this point, NHA president Robertson and secretary Frank Calder denied that the NHA would change, dissolve or adopt other subterfuge. This sale never completed. At the November 10, 1917 annual meeting of the NHA Livingstone was represented by J. F. Boland, who stated that if the league operated that the Toronto franchise intended to be a full member. The NHA voted to suspend operations for the 1917–18 season but not wind up the organization, and meet in one year's time. Efforts began immediately by the NHA clubs to form a new four-team replacement league. However, Livingstone was not invited to join them. While the Ottawa and two Montreal clubs were committed to playing, Quebec's status was unclear. If Quebec, which had run into financial trouble, could not play then a new temporary Toronto franchise would be granted to balance the schedule with a fourth team. Henry Pellatt fronted an ownership group that operated the Arena Gardens. In 1917, his group was awarded a franchise from the NHL. On November 26, 1917, representatives of the Ottawa, Quebec, and Montreal NHA clubs met at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The decision to start a new league, called the National Hockey League, was finalized and announced. The Quebec franchise was suspended and a franchise for Toronto was granted to the Arena Gardens of Toronto, Limited, an ownership group fronted by Henry Pellatt that owned and managed the Arena Gardens where the Blueshirts had played. The Toronto franchise was intended to be 'temporary' for only for the inaugural season, with the NHL instructing the company to resolve the dispute with Livingstone, which included litigation between Livingstone and the NHL, or transfer ownership of the Toronto franchise back to the League at the end of the season. The team was loaned the Blueshirts' players for the season. This effectively left Livingstone in a one-team league. On paper, the NHL clubs also remained members of the NHA and were able to vote down Livingstone's attempts to keep that league operating. Frank Calder gave the Arena Company was given a year to resolve the dispute or lose the temporary franchise. The Arena Company did agree to compensate Livingstone for the use of the players for the season, although no suitable figure was ever reached, and the league itself disputed any claims that Livingstone had on the players. Unlike the other two NHL franchises with NHA roots, the Canadiens and the Senators, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blue Shirts' history as their own, as the NHL was formed to remove Livingstone from the NHA and that franchise was folded. As such, pre-NHL Toronto could not be part of Maple Leafs history. They do, however, claim the history of the \\"temporary\\" Toronto franchise of 1917–18. Toronto Arenas (1917–1919) The Toronto NHA franchise did not have an official name during the NHL's inaugural season in 1917–18, but was still unofficially called \\"the Blueshirts\\" and \\"the Torontos\\" by the newspapers of the day, as well as by some fans. Although the roster was composed mainly of former Blueshirts, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts' history as their own. Under manager Charles Querrie and coach Dick Carroll, the Toronto team won the Stanley Cup that season. The dispute with Livingston included a disagreement regarding the distribution of revenues from the Toronto Stanley Cup games in 1917, resulting in the Toronto club not engraving their name on the Cup to memorialize their series victory at the time. In 1948, the NHL engraved \\"1918 Toronto Arenas\\" on the Cup, using the official nickname of the closely related 1918–19 Toronto franchise. Team photo for the Toronto Arenas during the NHL's inaugural season in 1917–18. Since the Torontos had won the Cup, even more revenue was at stake. The team was estimated now to be worth $20,000, and Livingstone demanded that as compensation. The Arena offered $7,000. This led to Livingstone filing another lawsuit, this against the Arena Company and Querrie for the $20,000. A league meeting of the old NHA proved futile, as heated arguments broke out between Livingstone and the other owners. The old NHA was disbanded, in spite of objections from Livingstone, and the other owners made plans to operate the NHL for a second season. However, George Kennedy gave some ground, saying that if Livingstone dropped his lawsuits, he might be allowed in the league. In the meantime, instead of returning the players to Livingstone or paying Livingstone, the Arena Company requested on October 19, 1918 that it be granted a permanent franchise, with Querrie and Arena Gardens treasurer Hubert Vearncombe as its owners. The new club, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club, popularly known as the Toronto Arenas, was an independent from the Arena Company's corporate structure, and thus was separated from the Livingstone lawsuits, though the franchise still used Livingstone's players without permission. At the same time, the Arena Company board decided that only NHL teams would be allowed to play at the Arena Gardens, effectively foreclosing Livingstone's efforts to resurrect the NHA. Livingstone and Percy Quinn, who owned the suspended Quebec Bulldogs of the NHA/NHL, unsuccessfully attempted to launch a competing Canadian Hockey Association (CHA)., with Quinn planning to relocate the Quebec club to Toronto as the \\"Shamrocks\\". Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell most of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win season in 1918–19. With the club losing money and no hope of catching Ottawa and Montreal in the standings in a three- team league, they requested permission to suspend operations for the season in late February 1919. League president Frank Calder persuaded the team to play its 18th game on February 20, after which the league ended the regular season prematurely (shortening the 20 game schedule) and immediately proceeded to the playoffs. The Arenas' .278 winning percentage that season is still the worst in franchise history. However, since the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals ended without a winner, the Arenas proclaimed themselves world champions by default. Livingstone's suit dragged through the courts for nearly a decade. In October 1923, a ruling was made that Arena Gardens had abused its position as a trustee of the assets of the Toronto Hockey Club—its player contracts—and finding damages of $100,000 in favour of Livingstone. That still was not the end, as the damages were later reduced to $10,000 and that decision was also appealed—all the way to the privy council, which dismissed the appeal in July 1926. Toronto St. Patricks (1919–1927) When the Arena Company declared bankruptcy, Charles Querrie, the team's first general manager, helped orchestrate the sale of the club to the St. Patricks Hockey Club. In 1919, Livingstone won a $20,000 judgement against the Arena Company, which promptly declared bankruptcy to avoid paying. General manager Charlie Querrie learned that the Arena Company wanted to sell. As an interim measure, Querrie changed the team name to the Tecumsehs on December 7, 1919, the name of a previous Toronto franchise in the NHA. The following day, Querrie reached agreement with the owners of the amateur St. Patrick's club of the Ontario Hockey Association to purchase the franchise, allowing him to maintain an ownership stake in the team. The NHL approved the sale on 13 December 1919. The group paid $5,000 to the NHL for the franchise. While the money was to go to Livingstone to compensate him for the loss of his NHA club, Livingstone never received the money. By all accounts, Calder pocketed the money himself. The incorporation date of the club was December 22, 1919. Querrie, Fred Hambly, Percy Hambly, and Paul Ciceri owned 99 shares each, while Richard Greer owned 4 shares. The new owners renamed the team the Toronto St. Patricks (or St. Pats for short), and changed the team's colours from blue to green. Among the officers of the St. Patrick's Professional Hockey Club Ltd. at the start of the 1919–20 season were president Fred Hambly, vice-president Paul Ciceri, secretary-treasurer Harvey Sproule, Charlie Querrie, and player-coach Frank Heffernan. The jersey colour was changed from blue to green. Team photo of the 1922 Toronto St. Patricks championship team. The 1921–22 NHL season led to the St. Pat's only Stanley Cup win. The team finished second to the Ottawa Senators, but caught fire in the playoffs. The St. Pats defeated the Senators in a two-game total goals series 5–4. The team then traveled to Vancouver to take on the Millionaires, winning the series 3–2 and the Cup. (see 1922 Stanley Cup Finals). The team was led by Babe Dye who scored 11 goals in the 7 playoff games, and John Ross Roach who had two shutouts. In 1924 Jack Bickell invested $25,000 in the St. Pats as a favour to his friend Querrie, who needed to financially reorganize his hockey team. The next two seasons the St. Pats did not make the playoffs, but qualified second in 1924–25, which had expanded the number of qualifiers to three as the Maroons and Bruins joined as expansion franchises. This meant a playoff with the Canadiens with the winner to play the Hamilton Tigers, the regular season champion. The St. Pats were defeated in what turned out to be the league finals as the Tigers were suspended. The next two seasons the St. Pats did not make the playoffs. During the mid-1920s, the St. Pats allowed other teams to use the Mutual Street Arena in the early and late months of the season, when it was usually too warm for proper ice. The Arena was the only facility east of Manitoba with artificial ice. Conn Smythe era (1927–1961) Querrie lost a lawsuit to Livingstone over the ownership of the franchise and decided to put the St. Pats up for sale. He reached an agreement in principle to sell them to C. C. Pyle for $200,000, who planned to move the team to Philadelphia. After Bickell contacted Conn Smythe to inform him of the sale, Smythe persuaded Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together a syndicate that bought the St. Pats. Smythe himself invested $10,000 of his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further $75,000 due 30 days later, with Bickell retaining his $40,000 share in the team. After taking control on Valentine's Day 1927, Smythe immediately renamed the team the Maple Leafs. (The Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team had won the International League championship a few months earlier and had been using that name for 30 years.) There have been numerous reasons cited for Smythe's decision to rename the team. The Maple Leafs say that the name was chosen in honour of the Maple Leaf Regiment from World War I. Another story says that Smythe named the team after a team he'd once scouted, called the East Toronto Maple Leafs. Smythe's name was initially kept in the background, even though he was the largest shareholder. When the newly renamed Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club Ltd. promoted a public share offering to raise capital, it only disclosed that \\"one of the most prominent hockey coaches in Toronto\\" would be taking over management of the club.\\"The Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club, Limited\\" (advertisement), Toronto Star, February 17, 1927, p. 18. That prominent coach turned out to be Smythe, who installed himself as general manager. He would be the face of the franchise for the next 34 years, though he would not buy controlling interest until 1947. Initial reports were that the team's colours would be changed to red and white,\\"Good-bye St. Pats, howdy Maple Leafs,\\" The Globe, February 15, 1927, p. 6 but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927.\\"Toronto crumbles New York chances,\\" The Globe, February 18, 1927, p. 8. On September 27, 1927, it was announced that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white, which they have worn ever since. While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, it is also true that top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their primary colour in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.Lance Hornby \\"The Story of Maple Leaf Gardens, 100 Memories at Church and Carlton\\", p. 37. Chicago Black Hawks. After four more lacklustre seasons (including three with Smythe as coach), Smythe saw the increasing popularity of the team, and the need for a new arena. Finding an adequate number of financiers, he purchased land from the Eaton family, and construction of the arena was completed in five months. The Leafs debuted their new arena, Maple Leaf Gardens, with a 2–1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on November 12, 1931. Led by the \\"Kid Line\\" (Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher) and coach Dick Irvin, the Leafs would capture their third Stanley Cup victory during the first season in their new digs. They would go the distance in 1932, vanquishing Charlie Conacher's older brother Lionel Conacher and his Montreal Maroons in the first round, then in the semi-finals against the Boston Bruins, winning in the sixth overtime of the final game, and would not be overwhelmed in the Stanley Cup Finals by the hated New York Rangers. Smythe took particular pleasure in defeating the Rangers that year; he had been tapped as the Rangers' first general manager and coach in the Rangers' inaugural season (1926–27), but had been fired in a dispute with Madison Square Garden management. the next season, only to be upended by the Rangers. The Kid Line consisted of Charlie Conacher, Joe Primeau, and Busher Jackson (left to right). They led the Leafs to win the 1932 Stanley Cup, as well as four more Stanley Cup finals appearances over the next six years. The Leafs' star forward, Ace Bailey, was nearly killed in 1933 when Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore checked him from behind into the boards at full speed. Maple Leafs defenceman Red Horner was able to knock Shore out with a punch, but it was too late for Bailey, who was by now writhing on the ice, had his career ended. Undeterred, the Leafs would reach the finals five more times in the next seven years, but would not win, bowing out to the now-defunct Maroons, the Detroit Red Wings in 1936, the Chicago Black Hawks in 1938, Boston in 1939, and the hated Rangers in 1940. After the 1940 loss, Smythe talked the moribund Canadiens into hiring Irvin as coach. Irvin was replaced in Toronto by former Leafs captain Hap Day. Toronto looked sure to suffer a similar fate in 1942, down three games to none in a best-of-seven final in 1942 against Detroit. However, fourth-line forward Don Metz would galvanize the team, coming from nowhere to score a hat-trick in game four and the game-winning goal in game five, with the Leafs winning both times. Captain Syl Apps had won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season, not taking one penalty and finishing his ten-season career with an average of 5 minutes, 36 seconds in penalties a season. Goalie Turk Broda would shut out the Wings in game six, and Sweeney Schriner would score two goals in the third period to win the seventh game 3–1 and the stanley cup. No other team has repeated a comeback like this in a stanley cup final since. The Maple Leafs score against Detroit during the 1942 Cup Finals. Down three games to none in the best-of-seven series, the Leafs won the next four games, performing the only reverse-sweep in the Cup Finals. Apps told writer Trent Frayne in 1949, \\"If you want me to be pinned down to my [biggest night in hockey but also my] biggest second, I'd say it was the last tick of the clock that sounded the final bell. It's something I shall never forget at all.\\" It was the first time a major pro sports team came back from behind 3–0 to win a best-of-seven championship series. Three years later, with their heroes from 1942 dwindling (due to either age, health, or the war), the Leafs turned to lesser-known players like rookie goalie Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt. They would upset the Red Wings in the 1945 finals. In the 1946-47 NHL season, Maple Leaf Gardens was the first arena in the NHL to have Plexiglas inserted in the end zones of the rink.Hockey's Book of Firsts, p.66, James Duplacey, JG Press, The powerful defending champion Montreal Canadiens and their \\"Punch Line\\" (Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard, Toe Blake and Elmer Lach) would be the Leafs' nemesis two years later when the two teams clashed in the 1947 finals. Ted \\"Teeder\\" Kennedy would score the game-winning goal late in game six to win the Leafs their first of three straight Cups -- the first time any NHL team had accomplished that feat. With their Cup victory in 1948, the Leafs moved ahead of Montreal for the most Stanley Cups in franchise history. It would take the Canadiens 10 years to reclaim the record. Turk Broda with the Stanley Cup and Vezina Trophy after the 1948 Finals. The Maple Leafs and Canadiens met again in the 1951 finals, with five consecutive overtime games played in the series. Defenceman Bill Barilko managed to score the series-winning goal in overtime, leaving his defensive position (in spite of coach Joe Primeau's instructions not to) to pick up an errant pass and score. Barilko helped the club secure its fourth Stanley Cup in five years. His glory was short-lived, as he disappeared in a plane crash near Timmins, Ontario, four months later. The crash site was not found until a helicopter pilot discovered the plane's wreckage plane about north of Cochrane, Ontario eleven years later. The Leafs did not win another Cup during the 1950s, with rumours swirling that the team was \\"cursed\\", and would not win a cup until Barilko's body was found. The \\"curse\\" came to an end after the Leafs' 1962 Stanley Cup victory, which came six weeks before to the discovery of the wreckage of Barilko's plane. Their 1951 victory was followed by lacklustre performances in the following seasons. The team finished third in the 1951–52 season, and were eventually swept by the Red Wings in the semi-finals. With the conclusion of the 1952–53 regular season, the Leafs failed to make it to the post-season for the first time since the 1945–46 playoffs. The Leafs' poor performance may be attributed partly to a decline in their sponsored junior system (including the Toronto St. Michael's Majors and the Toronto Marlboros). The junior system was managed by Frank J. Selke until his departure to the Canadiens in 1946. In his absence, the quality of players it produced declined. Many who were called up to the Leafs in the early 1950s were found to be seriously lacking in ability. It was only later in the decade that the Leafs' feeder clubs produced prospects that helped them become competitive again. After a two-year drought from the playoffs, the Maple Leafs clinched a berth after the 1958–59 season. Under Punch Imlach, their new general manager and coach, the Leafs made it to the 1959 Finals, losing to the Canadiens in five games. Building on a successful playoff run, the Leafs followed up with a second-place finish in the 1959–60 regular season. Although they advanced to their second straight Cup Finals, the Leafs were again defeated by the Canadiens in four games. New owners, new dynasty (1961–1972) Toronto was unable to match up with their Cup-winning teams of the 1940s and 1951 for a long time, and stronger teams like Detroit and Montreal won the Cup year after year. In fact, the Habs' 1950s dynasty closed with a last-round Maple Leaf sweep. They did not win another Stanley Cup until 1962. Johnny Bower (in net) during a game against the Black Hawks. Bower was the Maple Leafs' goaltender from 1958 to 1969. He helped the team win four Cups. Before the 1961–62 season, Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens to a partnership of his son Stafford Smythe, newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard. The sale price was $2.3 million—a handsome return on his original investment 34 years earlier. According to Stafford's son Thomas, Conn Smythe said years later that he expected to sell his shares only to his son and would not have sold his shares to the partnership.[Smythe], pp. 44–45. However, it is not likely that Conn Smythe could have believed that Stafford could have raised the money needed to make the deal on his own. This purchase gave the three control of about 60% ownership of the Leafs and Gardens. And then, Toronto was able to reel off another three straight Stanley Cup victories from 1962 to 1964, with the help of Hall of Famers Frank Mahovlich, Red Kelly, Johnny Bower, Dave Keon, Andy Bathgate and Tim Horton, and under the leadership of coach and general manager Punch Imlach. However, Bathgate claimed after 1964–65 that all the autocratic Imlach said to himself and Mahovlich was insulting: > Imlach never spoke to Frank Mahovlich or myself for most of the season, and > when he did, it was to criticize. Frank usually got the worst. We are > athletes, not machines, and Frank is the type that needs some encouragement, > a pat on the shoulder every so often. It was Bathgate's one-way ticket to the floundering Red Wings, but Toronto would, for a few more years, keep \\"The Big M.\\" In 1967, the Leafs and Canadiens met in the Cup finals for the last time. Montreal was considered to be a heavy favourite as analysts said that the Leafs were just a bunch of has- beens. But Bob Pulford scored the double-overtime winner in game three, Jim Pappin got the series winner in game six, and Keon won the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player of the playoffs as the Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup in six games. The Leafs have not won the Stanley Cup or even reached the finals since. The next two seasons saw a great deal of turnover, engineered by Imlach, who detested the new Players' Association headed by Maple Leaf players. Bobby Baun and Kent Douglas were left unprotected in the expansion draft. They missed the playoffs altogether in 1968, after which Mahovlich was traded to Detroit in a blockbuster trade. They returned to the playoffs in 1969, but a disastrous first-round sweep by the Bruins, Smythe fired Imlach. Ballard years (1972–1990) Following Stafford Smythe's death, Harold Ballard bought Stafford Smythe's shares, taking control of the team as of February, 1972, under terms of Stafford Smythe's will, allowing each partner to buy the other's shares upon their death. Stafford Smythe's brother Hugh also sold his shares to Ballard, ending the Smythe family's 45-year involvement in the NHL. Stafford Smythe's son Thomas alleges that Ballard wrote the will to his advantage.[Smythe], p. 105. One of the most detested owners in NHL history, he traded away many of the team's most popular players. He also blocked Keon from signing with another NHL team when his contract ran out in 1975, forcing him to jump to the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association. Ballard assumed (correctly) that the Leafs would continue to sell out regardless of the team's on-ice quality, and refused to raise the payroll any higher than necessary to be profitable. During the 1970s, with the overall level of talent in the league diluted by the addition of 12 new franchises and the rival WHA, the Leafs, led by a group of stars such as Darryl Sittler, Lanny McDonald, enforcer Tiger Williams, Ian Turnbull and Borje Salming were able to ice competitive teams for several seasons. On February 7, 1976, Sittler would score six goals and four assists against the Bruins to establish an NHL single-game record that still stands more than 30 years later. On February 2, 1977, Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Ian Turnbull would be the first player in NHL history to score five goals on five shots.Hockey's Book of Firsts, p.27, James Duplacey, JG Press, Despite the performances, the Leafs were not able to qualify for the Stanley Cup Finals. They only once made it past the second round of the playoffs, besting the New York Islanders, a soon-to-be dynasty, in the 1978 quarter-finals, only to be swept by their arch-rivals the Montreal Canadiens, in the semi-finals. Punch Imlach won four Cups as the Leafs' coach in the 1960s. However, his second stint as the club's general manager during the 1979–80 season was controversial, as he traded Lanny McDonald, and engaged in a public dispute with team captain Darryl Sittler. In July 1979, Ballard brought Imlach, a longtime friend, back to the organization as GM. When the Leafs traded McDonald, a close friend of Sittler, to the moribund Colorado Rockies on December 29, 1979; a member of the Leafs anonymously told the Toronto Star that Ballard and Imlach would \\"do anything to get at Sittler\\"\\"Lanny McDonald trade has Sittler in tears,\\" Jim Kernaghan, Toronto Star, December 29, 1979, p. 1. and traded McDonald to undermine Sittler's influence on the team. Sittler, along with other Leafs who were members of the NHL Players' Association, was agitating for a better contract. Angry teammates trashed their dressing room in response, and Sittler temporarily resigned his captaincy. NHL executive director Alan Eagleson, who was also Sittler's agent, called the trade \\"a classless act.\\" Sittler himself was gone two years later, when the Leafs traded him to the Philadelphia Flyers. He left as the franchise's all-time leading scorer. The McDonald trade sent the Leafs into a downward spiral. They finished five games under .500 and only made the playoffs due to the presence of the Quebec Nordiques, a refugee from the WHA, in the Adams Division. Ironically, Ballard had opposed taking the Nordiques and three other WHA teams into the NHL for the start of the 1979–80 season. He had never forgiven the WHA for nearly decimating his roster in the early 1970s, and the addition of three Canadian teams (the Nordiques, Winnipeg Jets and Edmonton Oilers) significantly reduced the Leafs' revenue from Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts (which was now split six ways rather than three). For the next 12 years, the Leafs were barely competitive, not posting another winning record until 1992–93. They missed the playoffs six times and only finished above fourth in their division once (in 1990, the only season where they even posted a .500 record). They only made it beyond the first round of the playoffs twice (in 1986 and 1987, advancing to the division finals). The low point came in 1984–85, when they finished 32 games under .500, the second- worst record in franchise history (their .300 winning percentage was only 22 percentage points higher than the 1918–19 Arenas). Many times, they made the playoffs with horrendous records, in at least two cases with the worst winning percentages on record for a playoff team. In 1985-86, for instance, they finished with the fourth-worst record in the league (and fourth-worst in franchise history, at .356). However, the Norris Division was extremely weak that year; the division champion Black Hawks only notched 86 points. In those days, the four top teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. Despite finishing with two fewer points than the New Jersey Devils, the Leafs made the playoffs. They then swept the Hawks in three games before going down to the Blues in seven games. In 1987–88, they finished with the second-worst record in the league (and third-worst record in franchise history, at .325), and only a point ahead of the Minnesota North Stars for the worst record. However, the Norris Division was even weaker than it had been two years earlier; the Red Wings were the only team with a winning record. As a result, the Leafs and Stars were actually still in playoff contention on the last day of the season. The Leafs defeated the Red Wings in the final game of the regular season, while the Stars lost to the Flames. This handed the Leafs the final playoff spot from the division. The Leafs gave the Red Wings a surprisingly tough series in the first round, pushing them to six games. Many Leafs fans consider Ballard's tenure as owner to be the darkest era in team history; indeed, they only notched six winning seasons during Ballard's 18-plus years as majority owner, never finished above third in their division and only got out of the second round twice. The Leafs' subpar performance led some to call them the \\"Maple Laughs.\\" The Leafs' poor record resulted in several high draft picks. Wendel Clark, the first overall pick in the 1985 draft went on to captain the team. Resurgence (1990–2004) Ballard died in 1990. A year later, supermarket tycoon Steve Stavro, a longtime friend of Ballard's, bought the team from Ballard's estate in partnership with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Unlike Ballard, Stavro hated the limelight and rarely interfered in the Leafs' hockey operations. After 1991–92, ex-Calgary Flames GM Cliff Fletcher took over the team. He made a series of trades and free agent acquisitions which turned the Leafs from an also-ran to a contender almost overnight. Unlike the league's other Canadian teams, the Leafs were not seriously impacted by the escalation of player salaries in the early 1990s. In fact, they actually thrived, as they were based in the league's fourth largest market. The Maple Leafs faced the Blackhawks in the Western Conference Quarterfinals of the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs. The new stars paid almost immediate dividends in 1992–93. Doug Gilmour, who had come over from the Flames the previous season, scored 32 goals and 95 assists to lead the team in scoring. Dave Andreychuk had come to the Leafs from the Buffalo Sabres and would score 25 goals in his first 31 games as a Leaf as well as being the league's leading power-play goal scorer. Netminder Felix Potvin was also solid with an NHL-best 2.50 goals-against average. Toronto finished with a franchise-record 99 points, good enough for third place in the Norris Division and the eighth-best record in the league. The Leafs dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in the first round with an overtime winner from Nikolai Borschevsky in game seven, then won the Norris Division final by defeating the St. Louis Blues, also in seven games. With Montreal facing the New York Islanders in the Wales Conference final, Canadians and hockey purists began dreaming of a Montreal-Toronto Cup final, as the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings, led by their captain Wayne Gretzky, in the Campbell Conference final. The Leafs were up 3–2 in the series, but lost game six. Gretzky's hat-trick in game seven would finish the Leafs' run, and it would be the Kings who would move on to the Finals against the Canadiens. The Leafs had another strong season in 1993–94, finishing with 98 points. This was good enough for the fifth-best record in the league—their highest overall finish in 16 years. However, despite finishing one point above the Calgary Flames, the Leafs were seeded third in the Western Conference (formerly the Campbell Conference) by virtue of the Flames' Pacific Division title. However, a six-game series against the Blackhawks and a seven-game series against the San Jose Sharks took their toll on the team; they were defeated by the Vancouver Canucks—a team that finished 13 points below them in the regular season—in five games. Mats Sundin with the Maple Leafs during the 1997–98 season, his first season as team captain. After two years out of the playoffs in the late 1990s, the Leafs made another charge during the 1999 playoffs after moving from Maple Leaf Gardens to the new Air Canada Centre. Mats Sundin, who had joined the team from the Quebec Nordiques in a 1994 trade involving Wendel Clark, had one of his most productive seasons, scoring 31 goals and totaling 83 points. Sergei Berezin scored 37 goals, Curtis Joseph won 35 games with a 2.56 GAA, and enforcer Tie Domi racked up 198 penalty minutes. The Leafs eliminated the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins in the first two rounds of the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Maple Leafs would reach the second round in both 2000 and 2001, losing both times to the New Jersey Devils, who would make the Stanley Cup Finals both seasons. The 2000 season was particularly notable because it marked the Leafs' first division title in 37 years, as well as the franchise's first-ever 100-point season. The season ended on a particular low, however, with the Leafs being held to just 6 shots in the final contest (game six) against the Devils. In 2002, they would dispatch the Islanders and their trans-Ontario rivals, the Ottawa Senators, in the first two rounds, only to lose to the Cinderella-story Carolina Hurricanes in the Conference Finals. The 2002 season was particularly impressive in that the Leafs had many of their better players sidelined by injuries, but managed to make it to the conference finals due to the efforts of lesser-known players who were led mainly by Gary Roberts, who put up a heroic fight, although they would eventually fall to the Hurricanes. Joseph left to go to the defending champion Red Wings in the 2002 off-season; the team almost immediately found a replacement in veteran Ed Belfour, who came over from the Dallas Stars and had been a crucial part of their 1999 Stanley Cup run. Belfour could not help their playoff woes in the 2003 playoffs, however, as they lost to Philadelphia in seven games in the first round. The 2003–04 season started in an uncommon way for the team, as they held their training camp in Sweden, and playing in the NHL Challenge against teams from Sweden and Finland. That year, the Leafs posted a franchise-record 103 points. They also finished with the fourth-best record in the league—their best overall finish in 41 years. They also managed a .628 win percentage, their best in 43 years (and the third-best in franchise history). They defeated the Senators in the first round of the playoffs for the fourth time in five years, but lost to the Flyers in the second round in six games. Post-lockout (2005–2014) Following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the Maple Leafs experienced their longest playoff drought in the club's history. They struggled in the 2005–06 season; despite a late-season surge (9–1–2 in their final 12 games), led by goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of playoff contention for the first time since 1998. They missed the playoffs by two points. This marked the first time the team had missed the postseason under Quinn, who was later relieved as head coach. Quinn's dismissal was controversial since many of the young players who were key contributors to the Leafs' late-season run had been drafted by him before Ferguson's arrival, while Ferguson's signings (Jason Allison, Belfour, Alexander Khavanov, and Eric Lindros) had suffered season-ending injuries. Paul Maurice, who had previously coached the inaugural season of the Maple Leafs' Toronto Marlies farm team, was named as Quinn's replacement. On June 30, 2006, the Leafs bought out fan-favourite Tie Domi's contract. The team also decided against picking up the option year on goaltender Ed Belfour's contract; he became a free agent. 2007–08 season, his last as a Maple Leaf. However, despite the coaching change, as well as a shuffle in the roster, the team did not make the playoffs in 2006–07, missing the playoffs by just one point. During the 2007–08 season, John Ferguson, Jr. was fired in January 2008, and replaced by former Leafs' general manager Cliff Fletcher on an interim basis. The Leafs did not qualify for the post-season, marking the first time since 1928 the team had failed to make the playoffs for three consecutive seasons. It was also Sundin's last year with the Leafs, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the season. However, he refused Leafs management's request to waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to rebuild by acquiring prospects and/or draft picks. On May 7, 2008, after the 2007–08 season, the Leafs fired Maurice, as well as assistant coach Randy Ladouceur, naming Ron Wilson as the new head coach, and Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler as assistant coaches. During the 2007–2008 season again the Leafs struggled in their division, only this time, their Captain, Mats Sundin was asked to waive his no-trade clause to try and advance the team's hopes of the playoffs, and a more promising 2008–2009 season.http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080225/sundin_future_080224/20080224?hub=TorontoHome Sundin declined, acknowledging that from his perspective the Leafs still had the chance to make the playoffs, and that he did not want to be a \\"rental player\\" to a playoff bound team. The other glaring factor, though rarely discussed was the obvious contractual obligation both parties had entered into when Sundin's contract was originally written—the no-trade clause. It is widely speculated that culmination of these events soured Leaf fans and also strained relations between Sundin and the Toronto organization. Ultimately, Toronto did not make the playoffs during the 2007–2008 season, and Mats Sundin was an unrestricted free agent, contemplating retirement from the NHL. Following approximately 9 months of contemplation, Mats Sundin returned to the NHL signing with the Vancouver Canucks.https://theprovince.com/sports/hockey/canucks- hockey/Mats+Sundin+Vancouver+Canuck/1092523/story.html Mats cited his decision to return to the NHL was based partly on \\"having a chance at winning the Stanley Cup\\".https://vancouversun.com/sports/wanted+chance+compete+Stanley+Sundin/1492918/story.html Toronto faced Vancouver two times during the 2008–2009 season, losing in both showdowns, most notably during a shoot out decision on February 21, 2009 where Mats Sundin was honored at the ACC. He also scored the winning goal to defeat Toronto.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxpNz_dM2fw Dion Phaneuf was named the team captain in the 2010 off-season, maintaining the position until he was traded to Ottawa in 2016. On November 29, 2008, the Maple Leafs hired Brian Burke as their 13th non-interim, and the first American, general manager in team history. The acquisition ended the second Cliff Fletcher era and settled persistent rumours that Burke was coming to Toronto. On June 26, 2009, Burke made his first appearance as the Leafs GM at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, selecting London Knights forward Nazem Kadri with the seventh overall pick. On September 18, 2009, Burke traded Toronto's first- and second-round 2010, as well as its 2011 first-round picks, to the Boston Bruins in exchange for forward Phil Kessel. On January 31, 2010, the Leafs made another high-profile trade, this time with the Calgary Flames in a seven-player deal that brought defenceman Dion Phaneuf to Toronto. The Maple Leafs finished 29th in the NHL in 2009–10, ahead of only the Edmonton Oilers, despite a 13-10-3 run in their last 23 games. In finishing 29th, the Bruins got the second-overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. On June 14, during the off-season, the Leafs named Phaneuf captain after two seasons without one following Sundin's departure. On February 18, 2011, the team traded long-time Maple Leafs defenceman Tomas Kaberle to the Bruins in exchange for prospect Joe Colborne, Boston's first- round pick in 2011, and a conditional second-round draft choice. The Leafs, under the play of rookie goaltender James Reimer, almost made the 2011 playoffs, but missed by six points. The 2011–12 season brought great expectations for the Leafs. Carried by the play of Kessel and Joffrey Lupul, Toronto had a successful start to the season, as they were 4th in the League at one point. Kessel and Lupul couldn't maintain that level of play, however, and missed the playoffs, finishing 26th in the League. On March 2, 2012, Burke fired Wilson and named Randy Carlyle the new head coach. However, the termination proved to be controversial as Wilson had received a contract extension just two months prior to being let go. Changes at the ownership level also occurred in August 2012, when the OTPP completed the sale of their shares in MLSE to BCE Inc. and Rogers Communications. On June 23rd, 2012, Burke traded defenseman Luke Schenn, a player he had drafted fifth overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, for James van Riemsdyk, a player who would play six productive seasons with Toronto. On January 9, 2013, Burke was fired as general manager, replaced by Dave Nonis. In their first full season under the leadership of Carlyle, Toronto managed to secure a playoff berth in the 2012–13 season (which was shortened again due to another lock-out) for the first time in eight years. After being down 3–1 in their first-round series with the Boston Bruins, the Maple Leafs rallied to win Games 5 & 6, but lost Game 7 after blowing a 4–1 lead in the third period. They lost 5–4 in overtime. Despite the season's success, it was not repeated during the 2013–14 season, as the Leafs failed to make the playoffs. The Leafs had a mid-season surge, getting to third in the Atlantic Division and 80 points, but after a March 13 win against the Kings, they went 6–14 to end the season, missing the playoffs. Brendan Shanahan era (2014–present) Brendan Shanahan was named the president and an alternate governor of the club shortly after the 2013–2014 season ended. Shortly after the end of the 2013–14 regular season, Brendan Shanahan was named as the president and an alternate governor of the Maple Leafs. On January 6, 2015, the Leafs fired Randy Carlyle as head coach, and assistant coach Peter Horachek took over on an interim basis immediately. While the Leafs had a winning record before Carlyle's firing, the team eventually collapsed. On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. At the beginning of February, Shanahan gained the approval of MLSE's Board of Directors to begin a \\"scorched earth\\" rebuild of the club. Both Dave Nonis and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after the season concluded. In addition, the Leafs also fired a number of assistant coaches, including Steve Spott, Rick St. Croix; as well as individuals from the Leafs' player scouting department. On May 20, 2015, Mike Babcock was named as the new head coach, and on June 23, Lou Lamoriello was named the 16th general manager in team history. On July 1, 2015, the Leafs packaged Kessel in a multi-player deal to the Pittsburgh Penguins in return for three skaters, including Kasperi Kapanen, a conditional first round pick, and a third round pick. Toronto also retained $1.2 million of Kessel's salary for the remaining seven seasons of his contract. During the following season, on February 9, 2016, the Leafs packaged Phaneuf in another multi-player deal, acquiring four players, as well as a 2017 2nd-round pick from the Ottawa Senators. The team finished last in the NHL for the first time since the 1984–85 season and secured a 20 percent chance at winning the first overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. They were also guaranteed to pick no lower than fourth. They subsequently won the draft lottery and used the first overall pick to draft Auston Matthews. The Maple Leafs faced the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2017 playoffs. In their second season under Babcock, Toronto secured the final Eastern Conference wildcard spot for the 2017 playoffs. On April 23, 2017, the Maple Leafs were eliminated from the playoffs by the top-seeded Washington Capitals. With a score of 2–1 in the sixth game of the first round, Marcus Johansson scored the winner for the Capitals 6:31 into overtime. Toronto finished the 2017–18 season with 105 points by beating Montreal 4–2 in their final game of the regular season, a franchise-record, beating the previous record of 103 points set in 2004. They faced the Boston Bruins in the First Round and lost in seven games. Following the playoffs, Lamoriello was not renewed as general manager and was transitioned to senior advisor. Kyle Dubas was subsequently named the 17th general manager in team history. During the 2018 off-season, the Maple Leafs signed John Tavares to a seven-year, $77-million dollar contract. Tavares was subsequently named an alternate captain for the Leafs, alongside Morgan Rielly, and Patrick Marleau. On April 1, the Maple Leafs clinched a division berth for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Maple Leafs were eliminated in the First Round of the 2019 playoffs on April 23, after losing to the Bruins in a seven-game series. On October 2nd, 2019, Taveres was named as the team's 25th team captain prior to the Leafs' 2019–20 season opening game. On November 20, 2019, Shanahan and the Leafs announced the firing of Babcock as head coach, following a six-game losing streak. At the time, the Leafs had a 9–10–4 record and were outside of the playoffs, despite high pre-season expectations. During his tenure as Leafs' head coach, Babcock had a record of 173-133-45 in 351 games with the Leafs. Babcock was replaced by Toronto Marlies head coach Sheldon Keefe.

While a road now leads up to the sanctuary, it is also possible to reach it along a 3.8 km monumental roofed arcade (Portico di San Luca) consisting of 666 arches, which was built in 1674–1793. It was meant to protect the icon as it was paraded up the hill. A yearly procession from the Cathedral of San Pietro in the centre of Bologna to the Sanctuary goes along this path. Originally the arches held icons or chapels erected by the patron family. History The icon of the Virgin Mary, allegedly painted by Luke the Evangelist. A church or chapel existed on the hill for about a thousand years. Tradition hold that in the 12th-century, a pilgrim from the Byzantine empire came to Bologna with an icon of the Virgin from the temple of Saint Sofia in Constantinople. In 1160, the bishop of Bologna Gerardo Grassi assigned the icon to a small hermitage-chapel atop the hill that was tended by two holy women, Azzolina and Beatrice Guezi. Construction of a church began in 1193. In 1294, some monks of the Dominican order from the monastery of Ronzano came to the site, and the order remained here until the Napoleonic suppression of 1799.History of the Church. The present church was constructed in 1723 using the designs of Carlo Francesco Dotti. The lateral external tribunes were built by Carlo Francesco's son, Giovanni Giacomo, using his father's plans. The centrally planned sanctuary has painted artworks by Domenico Pestrini, Donato Creti (second chapel on right); Guido Reni (Assumption in the third altar on the right), Giuseppe Maria Mazza in chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, Vittorio Bigari (frescoes) and Guercino (sacristy). Stucco works are by A. Borelli and G. Calegari and statues by Angelo Piò. Cycling The road leading up to the church is often used in professional cycling races. The Italian autumn classic race Giro dell'Emilia finishes on a circuit where the riders have to climb the road several times. It has also been used in the Giro d'Italia, where it made its debut in 1956 in an individual time trial stage won by Charly Gaul. Cable car Cable car approaching the mountain station From 1931 to 1976 an aerial cable car operated from the base of the hill on the outskirts of Bologna, to the summit. The total distance covered in the 7 minute travel time was 1328m with a vertical difference of 220m. The operation was closed due to increased usage of private transport to ascend the hill. The top station is abandoned but intact, the bottom station has been converted into apartments but remains structurally the same, and the single pylon remains intact in a field.

NDIA was established in 1919 as a result of the inability of the defense industry to scale up the war effort during World War I. Founding In 1917, Brigadier General Benedict Crowell was called to active duty and served on the General Munitions Board. As a board member, he established a relationship with the steel industry and was almost immediately appointed Assistant Secretary of War and Director of Munitions. As Director of Munitions, Crowell was a significant catalyst in improving the country's capability to produce arms and ammunition. However, he recognized the nation's need for an association that fostered cooperation between civilian industry and government in support of industrial preparedness. He founded the Army Ordnance Association (AOA) in 1919 and served as president for its first 25 years. Over the ensuing decades, AOA became the American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA), which then merged with the 1944 National Security Industrial Association (NSIA) in 1997, creating NDIA.

Serei Saophoan is the urban district of Banteay Meanchey province and the district capital is also the provincial capital Sisophon town. The town is located 359 kilometres north of Phnom Penh and 48 kilometres from the border with Thailand at Poipet. Serei Saophoan District is the central district of Banteay Meanchey and is surrounded by other Banteay Meanchey districts. Cambodia's main railway line from Phnom Penh to Poipet enters the district from the south and exits to the west. The district is easily accessed by road from Phnom Penh (359 km) Battambang (city) (68 km) and Siem Reap (city) (102 km). Serei Saophoan District is the smallest district in Banteay Meanchey province by land area. However, it has one of the largest district populations in the province due to its central location and access to transport infrastructure. National Highway 5 which begins in Phnom Penh and ends at Poipet and the National railway both bisect the district in parallel. National Highway 6 which begins in Phnom Penh also has its terminus at Sisophon town in Serei Saophoan. National road 56 begins at Sisophon town in the centre of the district and runs north east to Samraong in Oddar Meanchey province. Etymology Serei Saophoan means \\"glorious and auspicious\\" in Khmer. Serei () is derived from the Sanskrit word śrī (श्री) meaning \\"glorious\\", and Saophoan () is derived from the Sanskrit word śubhana meaning \\"auspicious\\".  Rehabilitation centre  A boot camp- style rehabilitation centre, chiefly for those addicted to drugs, is located within Serei Saophoan district, in Sisophon town. The camp is run by the military police, a division of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. Young men are sent to the centre by their parents because they take drugs, drink too much or are out of control. At the centre residents receive compulsory military training, massive amounts of exercise and self-criticism sessions 7 days per week for a minimum of five months. The centre submits its young inmates to a gruelling regime of military-style physical training. Residents are signed into the centre by their parents, regardless of their age, and attendance is voluntary. However, if the young men try to escape, the staff chase them, catch them and bring them back to the camp. There the other residents administer a beating.

The case was considered to be one of the most serious murder cases at the time, and was sensationalised by the media. Etymology The name of this murder case was derived from a Cantonese opera \\"Six States Installation of Minister\\" (), an opera set in the Seven Warring States period. Just before the murder, the murderer told his sister-in-law that he is about to do a rendition of the opera, and start killing Despite the murder itself had been forgotten, the phrase \\"Six States Installation of Minister\\" () has, in the decades since, entered popular vocabulary in Hong Kong to describe a chaotic, fierce argument or conflict. Background Exile to Hong Kong When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, Nationalist military officer Chu Shing-choi () escaped China to Hong Kong to rendezvous with his brother, Zhu Xingcai (). Zhu Xingcai was a merchant, and was in the United States at the time. As a result, Chu Shing-choi stayed at his brother's residence. During those times, it is common for flatowners in Hong Kong to sublet individual rooms to other people. So, Chu was, in fact, living with numerous other families: # Zhu Xingcai, his wife Kwan Yuet-ngo () and their son. # The sister of Guan Yue-E, Guan Yue Mei (), her husband Wang Ji Soeng (), and their three children. # The brother of Guan Yue-E, Guan Hong Sang (), his wife Chan Chiu (). # Maid Wong Mei () # Widow Wu Sam Gu () # The sister of Wang Zi Xiang, Wang Yi Man () Tension When Chu Shing-choi came to Hong Kong, he brought with him a small fortune that is sufficient for him to start a small business. However, Chu blew through his savings within a year, and began to borrow money from his sister-in-law. It was at this time that Chu's sister-in-law began to insult and belittle him. In addition, Chu's relation with the widow Wu San Gu, which was seen by Chu's sister-in-law as endearing, also drew fierce criticism, and this also caused Wu San Gu to leave the residence. In actuality, Chu Shing-choi liked Wang Qi Wen, and he moved with her to Shek Kip Mei to escape from his sister-in-law's insult. Preparations for murder During one fierce argument, Chu threatened to eventually deliver a rendition of \\"Six States Installation of Minister\\", but this did not deter Guan Yue-E, and even drove her children and the maid to go against Chu. In the meantime, Chu bought a butcher's knife and some petrol in preparations for murder. Murder On 5 November 1951, Chu Shing-choi went back to his former residence at No. 359 Lockhart Road to collect his properties. At this time, three women denounced him for taking up valuable space in the house, and an argument ensued. Chu then immediately went into the kitchen, took out the butcher's knife, and locked the main doors to the house. Before he assaulted his sister-in-law, Chu Shing-choi said \\"You wanted see my rendition of \\"Six States Installation of Minister\\", did you? I have been prepared a long time ago, and I already bought this knife for a month now. I will kill all today!\\" () After that speech, Chu struck his sister-in-law with the butcher's knife. She was struck in the head and both arms. As Guan Yue-E rushed out of the house for help, Chu rushed into Guan Yue-E's room, and killed Wong Siu-lun, Yue-E's three-year-old daughter. Chan Chiu also tried to escape, but failed, and was murdered as well. As for the maid, Wong Mei, she was seriously injured. After the murder, Chu took out the can of petrol he bought earlier, and poured it around the apartment and set it on fire. While escaping, Chu encounted Wang Zi-Xiang's son of age four, named Wong Shiu-young. Zhu grabbed the young Wong and threw him out from the 4th floor apartment, resulting in heavy injury for the boy. Despite the fact that a crowd had gathered, Wong wasn't stopped by the crowd due to believing he was merely escaping the fire. Casualties * Murdered: 3; Chen Chiu, Guan Yue-E, and Wong Siu-lun * Injured: 3; Guan Yue Mei, Wong Mei, and Wang Zi- Xiang's son Wong Shiu-young The other renters were not in flats at the time. Arrest and trial Due to the damages and casualties, the murder attract much sensations among Hong Kong news media, while the police had set up blockades to prevent him leaving Hong Kong. On 8 November 1951, at 6:50 am, Chu surrendered to the police at Central Police Station. During body search, it was discovered that he only had one Hong Kong dime, three handkerchiefs, and a letter addressed to the police and news media. In the letter, Chu laid out the motive and incident of the murder, as well as expressing his displeasure of the motive guessed by the news media, which wrongly reported his motive was during to failure to borrow money. In it, he stated that due to cynicism and scoldings from the women in the flat, he had planned to burn down the house and do nothing else; the murder was incidental caused by the women in their attempt to prevent the arson. He also stated that he greatly hated Guan Yue Mei, who had chased Wang Qi Wen away from him. He further confessed that he had planned to kill himself by jumping out of the flat's window, but due to the gathering crowd on the street he chose escape instead. He had attempt to hide with his girlfriend and friends, but due to the heavy reporting, none of them was willing to hide him, and thus he choose to surrender to the police. The court decided to try Chu only on one count, of the murder of Chen Xiao; it was common for the then-Hong Kong Judicial branch to focus on trying the most hindeous crime in order to minimise usage of Judicial resources, since if he was guilty on the charge of premeditated murder, he would be given death penalty. During the Trial, the defence attempted to use insanity caused by provocation, but prosecutor pointed out that the psychiatric reports showed the accused does not have any mental issues; furthermore, prior to the murder, the accused had prepared the instruments of murder, and had purposely locked the door, which showed that it was a deliberate, planned crime, and that the accused was not insane nor diminish during the moment of murder. Due to this, the jury delivered a guilty verdict to Zhu Sheng Cai on one count of murder, and was sentenced to be hanged on 23 May 1952.

No national highway runs through the district but national road 56 from Sisophon to Samraong in Oddar Meanchey province crosses the district from north to south. The district is home to the large temple complex of Banteay Chhmar. The temple was built in the late 12th or early 13th century by Jayavarman VII and is a modest tourist destination. The district is easily accessed by road from Sisophon (42 km), Battambang (city) (110 km), Siem Reap (city) (144 km) and Samraong (71 km). Thma Puok district is the largest districts in Banteay Meanchey province by land area but has a relatively small population due to its isolation. Large parts of the district, especially in the north west towards Thailand, are largely unpopulated. There is one official border crossing with Thailand in Kouk Romiet commune. One provincial road begins at the border and runs south east through the district to an intersection at Sarongk in Svay Chek district.

Description Male Limnonectes palavanensis grow to about and females to about in snout–vent length. There is a V-shaped ridge between the shoulders, and a sharp interorbital band that separates the anterior part of the head from differently colorer back. Juveniles have a medial vertebral stripe that in some populations persists in adults too. The tadpole is moderately flat (dorsoventrally compressed). The tail is twice the length of the body. The tail fin is low and ends in a pointed tip. Reproduction The male of this species guard the tadpoles that hatch from the eggs laid on the ground. The male then carries the tadpoles on its back to water. Habitat and conservation Its natural habitats are lower montane and lowland forests. The tadpoles develop in small rain pools and quiet sections of small, slow moving streams. The habitat of this species is mostly well protected, although it can potentially be impacted by habitat loss. It occurs in the Crocker Range National Park.

Leonidas is acclaimed by some to be one of the greatest sprinters of all time. Olympic career Competing in the Olympic Games of the 154th Olympiad in , the last of the \\"golden age\\" of the ancient Games, Leonidas captured the crown in three separate foot races -- the stadion, the diaulos, and the hoplitodromos.

It shares much of its history with Frederiksberg Gardens from which it is separated only by Roskildevej. Cisternerne—an underground venue for art exhibitions in the former cisterns—are located inside the park. History Ole Jørgen Rawert: Søndermarken, 1928 Søndermarken was founded and landscaped at the same time as Frederiksberg Gardens. Buildings & features Cisternerne Søndermarken features 3 underground cisterns which used to be part of Copenhagen's earliest water supply system. In 2001 they were converted into a museum for modern glass art, but since 2013 have been part of the Frederiksberg Museums, acting as a venue for art exhibitions, Cisternerne. The museum — located near Roskildevej, opposite the main entrance to the Copenhagen Zoo — is topped by 2 entrance pavilions and a fountain from 1890. Memorial Mound The entrance to the Memorial Mound The Memorial Mound is on a slope and was erected in 1925 to commemorate Danish immigration to America. In the 1920s, Danish-Americans in the United States conceived the idea to erect a memorial in Copenhagen as a counterpoint to the traditions surrounding Rebild Hills celebrations in Jutland. A committee of Danish-Americans was set up which charged the sculptor Anders Bundgaard with the commission. After prolonged discussions, it was ultimately decided that the monument should be a mound, with an embellished inner chamber, placed in Søndermarken. The necessary funds were raised through a worldwide collection among expatriate Danes. Around $12,000 was collected and the monument was inaugurated in 1925 with a ceremony attended by 40,000 people, including the entire Danish royal family. The mound measures 8 metres in diameter and is 5 metres tall. It is surrounded by tall trees and is reached along a narrow stone-lined passageway. Chiselled above the entrance is the inscription: \\"They who set out, never to return.\\" At the top of the cupola is a metre-wide opening to let in daylight. At the centre of the room is the life-size figure of a woman who embraces her children, symbolizing Mother Denmark. Built into the wall are 9 bas-reliefs with symbolic descriptions of the emigrants’ lives and activities abroad. In the floor is a five-pointed star representing the five continents. The memorial mound is open to the public every year on 4 July. Statues The Oehlenschläger statue on a winter's day There is a statue in the central reservation at each end of Norske Allé. At the zoo end stands a statue of Adam Oehlenschläger, one of the central persons of the Danish Golden Age. It is designed by Julius Schultz and was originally located at the site of the current Frederiksberg Town Hall Square and inaugurated on 24 October 1897. When the new Town Hall was built, the statue was moved to its current location in Søndermarken and placed on a new plinth. It now faces Frederiksberg Palace where Oehlenschläger grew up. At the other end of Norske Allé, near Carlsberg, stands a statue of the politician Carl Christian Hall, Danish prime minister from 1857 to 1859 and 1860 to 1863. It is designed by Vilhelm Bissen and was inaugurated on 15 September 1890. Vanguard Festival Vanguard Festival is an annual music festival with music acts representing different genre but with an emphasis on hip hop, combining it with a family-friendly atmosphere and picnic baskets. Vanguard Late Night continues the festival in Vega when the programme ends in Søndermarken. The first festival took place on 2-4 August 2013, attracting some 9,000 people (day-tickets included). Music acts included Wu-Tang Clan, MF Doom and Sixto Rodriguez. The festival has signed a five year contract with the Castles and Properties Agency on using the park.

Studies of its larvae revealed that the nominal species contained two cryptic forms, and in 2011, Shimada and colleagues described Meristogenys dyscritus as a separate species. Etymology The specific name amoropalamus is derived from the Greek words amoros (=\\"incomplete\\") and palame (=\\"web\\") and refers to the poorly developed toe webbing of this species. Description Adult females grow to about snout–vent length, whereas males are considerably smaller. The maximum lengths reported by Shimada and colleagues are for males and females, respectively. Males are less robustly built than females and have a relatively much larger tympanum. The snout is comparatively blunt. The fingers and the toes bear round discs; the toes are fully only partially webbed. The dorsum is light brown and has small dark spots on the trunk. The lower parts are whitish. Habitat and conservation Meristogenys amoropalamus live in montane forests at elevations of above sea level and are only encountered along the banks of clear, rocky streams. The tadpoles adhere to rocks and feed on lithophytes. This species is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging and agricultural activities. It is also collected for food.

It stars Shaan, Saima, Shamyl Khan, Haidar Sultan. The title was meant to be \\"786\\"; the Censor Board members did not approve, so it was changed. Plot Hum Eik Hain begins with an Aaan showing Badshahi Mosque and other parts of Lahore with rather badly photographed (and badly lit) clips. The titles end on Shan (Mustafa) who is the muezzin. He is educated, wears jeans and is looking for a job. However, he can't get a job even with repeated interviews. The academic degrees are not even worth good enough to be sold as waste paper. Trash must go to trash and the degrees are burnt alive in a rage of disappointment and frustration. There seems to be plenty of fire around at nights around Lahore with flames burning inside large empty drums (read 'a heavy symbolism of hero's agony'). Shan's mother is very religious and dresses like a nun in white. She helps children with Quran lessons and baptizes babies by marking '786' on their foreheads (it is supposed to be a good omen). Coming back to fire in the streets, Shan watches a Maulana being gunned down in cold blood. He is a witness and must suffer at the hands of the police and the establishment. Shan joins Nisar Qadri's gang, delivering bags (containing bombs) from one place of the town to other and is instrumental in inadvertently killing his mother who happens to be traveling in one such bus to be blown up on Nisar Qadri's command. Shan is strictly not allowed to see inside the bag and find out what deadly explosives he has been carrying and delivering. It is time for him to change his loyalties, which he quickly does. He builds up a gang of his own, who wear red bandanas with '786' emblazoned on them. The villains must be paid in their own currency and the scores are settled on the occasion of Ashura when crowds are purifying their sins from events of Karbala. A van carrying explosives by Haider Sultan is diverted minutes before but blood baths are choreographed simultaneously in the nearby deserted streets.

Many cryptic species have been separated from this species. Based on mitochondrial DNA, current \\"true\\" Meristogenys jerboa still includes two major lineages. However, because the lineages occur in sympatry and do not differ in morphology, Shimada and colleagues elected to treat them as intraspecific variants. Description Females can grow to in snout–vent length, males are considerable smaller. In a sample of 32 males and 6 females representing several populations, adult males measured and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is protruding in vertical view. Males have larger tympanum compared to females. Males have a slender body, whereas females are slightly more stocky. The toes are webbed. A black marking surrounds the eye and the tympanum and extends to the flank. The iris is bronze in the upper third and coppery in the lower parts. The tadpoles have a large suctorial disk. They are light brown, but can have orange to slightly olive hue. The snout and body are depressed and streamlined. The tail is strong with a pointed tip. The largest tadpoles (Gosner stages 38–41) reach in total length. Habitat and conservation Meristogenys jerboa occurs in rocky streams in lowland and hillside forests. Breeding takes place along rocky streams where the tadpoles cling to the rocks, probably feeding on lithophytic algae. The type locality is within the Matang Forest Reserve, where the species is abundant and not under threat.

It is endemic to Borneo and known from between central Sarawak (Malaysia) and central Kalimantan (Indonesia). The specific name poecilus is derived from the Greek poikolos, meaning \\"pied\\" or \\"blotched\\", in reference to diagnostic pattern on rear of the thigh. Common name Malaysian Borneo frog has been coined for this species. Description Males typically measure and females in snout–vent length. The snout is obtusely pointed and projecting beyond the jaw. The tympanum is visible. The fingers and the toes bear round discs; the toes are fully webbed. The legs are relatively long. Skin is dorsally shagreened; indistinct dorsolateral folds are present. The lower surfaces are rugose, except for the throat that is smooth. Dorsal colouration is chocolate brown, with darker flanks. The upper lip is whitish and the lower lip is barred black and white. A dark brown to blackish brown band runs from the eye to the inguinal region. The throat is white to pale yellow; the venter is yellow; some individuals have faint dark mottling on the throat and the chest whereas others may be completely dark brown. The legs are dorsally barred. The rear of the thigh in preserved specimens shows irregular light blotches (presumably yellow in life) on dark brown background. Habitat and conservation Meristogenys poecilus occurs in hilly lowland rainforests. Breeding takes place along small, clear, rocky streams where the tadpoles cling to the rocks, feeding on lithophytic algae. This species is locally abundant. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by clear-cutting. It is present in the Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary and in the Betung-Kerikum National Park.

It is endemic to Borneo and found in both Indonesia (Kalimantan) and Malaysia (western Sabah). Meristogenys stigmachilus and Meristogenys stenocephalus, described as new species in 2011, were formerly included in this species. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing these species under field conditions, the exact range of this species is uncertain. Its common name is Whitehead's Borneo frog or Whitehead's torrent frog. (includes photographs) Etymology This species is named after John Whitehead, explorer who collected the type series from Mount Kinabalu, Malaysia. Description The dorsum is light brown to greenish dark brown. The lips are dark grey to black. The iris is bicoloured, with a reddish orange horizontal band in the middle surrounded by whitish brown bands above and below. The centre of the tympanum usually has a small light circle. The limbs have alternating light- and dark- brown dorsal cross-bars. The rear of thigh is light brown with scattered light dots. The throat and chest are whitish, with dark dots; abdomen is whitish. The legs are whitish ventrally, with patches of pigmentation. The pattern may vary between locations. Meristogenys whiteheadi are relatively large frogs. Males from Sabah measured in snout–vent length (SVL) and females SVL. Males from Sarawak measured SVL and females SVL.

Daly also serves as chairman of the board for the American Film Institute. Additionally, he is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television’s Dean’s Advisory Board and the UCLA Executive Board for the Medical Sciences. In 2006, he joined the board of the USC Annenberg School for Communication. Biography Education and career at CBS Robert A. Daly attended Brooklyn College and Hunter College. Daly began as a gofer for the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1955, before beginning a career path to \\"president of entertainment\\". In addition to his duties as chief of television operations at CBS, Daly was also responsible for CBS Theatrical Films, which was formed in October 1979. During his 25-year association with CBS, Daly served in various posts, including executive vice president of CBS Television Network and vice president of business affairs. Warner Bros. Having left CBS, he joined Warner Bros. on December 1, 1980. His titles were chairman of the board and co-chief executive officer. One year later, he was named chairman of the board and chief executive officer and appointed Terry Semel president and chief operating officer. Daly resumed his previous title on March 30, 1994, when he announced he would share his office with Semel. On November 16, 1995, Daly and Semel added the Warner Music Group to their responsibilities and also became chairmen and co-chief executive officers of Warner Music Group. On July 15, 1999, Daly and Semel announced they would not seek to renew their contracts with Time Warner (the parent company of Warner Bros. and the parent company at the time of the Warner Music Group), which expired at the end of 1999. During the Daly/Semel era at Warner Bros., the motion pictures they are credited with garnered 13 Best Picture Oscar nominations, three of which were winners. The three Oscar winners that Daly and Semel helped steer were Chariots of Fire, Driving Miss Daisy and Unforgiven. Daly and Semel oversaw many Warner Bros. television series, including China Beach, Murphy Brown, Friends and ER. Daly and Semel are responsible for creating the current model of co-financing motion pictures while retaining worldwide distribution; and for extending brands like Batman, Superman and Looney Tunes characters into franchises, licensed products and into worldwide retail stores. However, some people felt the two had been stretched too far in trying to oversee such a massive conglomerate. In a 1997 interview that Mr. Daly gave for the New York Times it is said \\"Mr. Daly brushed aside the notion that he and Mr. Semel are stretched too thin. 'If we were, we wouldn't have taken the job...'[.]\\" Los Angeles Dodgers Daly went to the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball organization after 19 years at Warner Bros. He served as managing partner, chairman and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Dodgers, overseeing all operations of the organization. Daly stepped down from The Dodgers after four and a half years, when the organization was sold in 2004. Save The Children Daly completed his term as chairman of the board of trustees for Save the Children on February 28, 2010. In his five years as Board Chair, he oversaw annual program growth averaging 13.5 percent, serving 48 million children served in 2008. He also spearheaded the creation of Save the Children's first domestic response unit in the United States, which has proven successful in responding to disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, Gustave and Ike.

Taxonomy Originally Denticetopsis as described by Ferraris in 1996 was restricted to two species, D. royeroi and D. sauli. These two species have proved to be a subunit of a larger clade that also includes two species previously assigned to the now invalid genus Pseudocetopsis (D. macilenta, D. praecox), together with three species described as new in 2005 (D. epa, D. iwokrama, D. seducta).  Species  There are currently seven recognized species in this genus: * Denticetopsis epa Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 * Denticetopsis iwokrama Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 * Denticetopsis macilenta (C. H. Eigenmann, 1912) * Denticetopsis praecox (Ferraris & B. A. Brown, 1991) * Denticetopsis royeroi Ferraris, 1996 * Denticetopsis sauli Ferraris, 1996 * Denticetopsis seducta Vari, Ferraris & de Pinna, 2005 Distribution Denticetopsis species are distributed in northern South America where they are found distributed between Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil. Description Denticetopsis can be distinguished from other genera of Cetopsinae by a number of characteristics. The margin of the caudal fin is either shallowly forked and symmetrical or obliquely truncate. The outer most rays are no more than one and one-half times the length of the inner most rays; in other genera of Cetopsinae, these rays are one and three-quarters to two times the length of the innermost rays. The medial most pelvic-fin ray has a membranous attachment to the body for the basal third to fourth of its length instead of the basal-most half of its length. The possession of a first pectoral-fin ray that is spinous for the basal one-half of its length further separates Denticetopsis from Cetopsis and Paracetopsis, both of which lack a spinous first pectoral-fin ray. Denticetopsis is further distinguished from Cetopsidium in the lack of the dorsal-spine locking mechanism and in the having a lateral line extending either only onto the abdomen or distinctly further posteriorly onto the caudal peduncle, instead of terminating above the base of the anal fin. Most Denticetopsis have a moderately elongate body (though moderately stout in D. macilenta and deep in D. royeroi) that is slightly compressed (laterally or transversely, depending on species) anteriorly and becoming progressively distinctly compressed posteriorly. The body depth at the dorsal fin origin is usually about one-quarter of the fish's standard length, but can be as low as one-fifth and as high as almost one- third. In most species, the lateral line is complete, unbranched in midlateral, extending from the vertical through the pectoral fin base to the caudal peduncle; however, in D. royeroi and D. sauli, it is incomplete, interrupted, and restricted to the abdomen. The dorsal profile of the body tends to be nearly straight to slightly convex; the ventral profile is slightly convex to convex at the abdomen and is usually approximately straight but posterodorsally slanted along the base of the anal fin. Except for D. macilenta which has a distinctly rounded head and snout, the head of Denticetopsis species in profile is acutely triangular overall with a bluntly pointed snout. The eyes are situated on the sides of the head and are visible from above but not from below. The mouth is inferior, the width from approximately one-half to two-thirds of the length of the head. In most species of Denticetopsis, the medial mental barbels are slightly shorter than the lateral mental barbels, with the latter approximately equal in length to the slender maxillary barbels. However, in C. sauli both pairs of mental barbels are approximately the same length and shorter than the maxillary barbels, and in C. royeroi all three pairs of barbels are approximately the same length. The dorsal fin is moderately large overall. The dorsal fin spinelet is absent. The anal fin base is usually moderately long but may be long. The pelvic fins are usually moderate but may be moderately long, though in D. sauli they are short. The pectoral fin length is about one-half the length of the head length. Denticetopsis species range from 1.8-6.7 centimetres (.71-2.6 in) SL. Sexual dimorphism in the shape of the dorsal, pectoral, and anal fins has not been described in species of Denticetopsis, despite the presence of these traits in Cetopsis and Cetopsidium. It is possible that male D. praecox reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than females of the same species. Ecology D. praecox have been found in a cobble-pebble habitat of black water streams that ranged in pH from 4.3-5.0. Stomachs of two examined specimens of this species contained larval chironomids and other larval insect remains.

The district capital is Chol Kiri town located around 8 kilometres south of the provincial capital of Kampong Chhnang by road. Chol Kiri District is the easternmost district of Kampong Chhnang. The district shares a border with Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham provinces to the east. Most of the district is low lying floodplain and the Tonlé Sap river runs through the district roughly from north to south. This proximity to the river and the lack of high land make Chol Kiri one of the most flood prone districts in the country. The Kampong Chhnang Department of Development has estimated that both Chol Kiri and Kampong Leaeng districts are flooded for six months of the year and that after the floodwaters have receded drinking water sources are left contaminated. The district has virtually no significant road infrastructure and all settlements are located along the Tonle Sap river and various smaller tributaries. Chol Kiri District is one of the smallest districts in Kampong Chhnang province by land area and only Kampong Chhnang District is smaller. It also has the smallest district population in the province due to its small size, flooded landscape and lack of road transport infrastructure. Two small tertiary roads run to Chol Kiri town from National Highway 6 in Batheay District in Kampong Cham Province.  Location  Chol Kiri district lies in the east of the province and shares a border with Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham provinces. Reading from the north clockwise, Chol Kiri borders with Kampong Leang district to the north and north west and Baray District of Kampong Thom to the north east. The eastern border of the district is shared with Batheay district of Kampong Cham province. To the south the district shares a border with Kampong Tralach district. The western border of the district joins with Rola B'ier District and Kampong Chhnang district which surrounds the provincial capital.  Administration  The district is subdivided into 5 communes (khum) and 26 villages (phum). The Chol Kiri district governor reports to His Excellency Touch Marim, the Governor of Kampong Chhnang.

This population consisted of 13,883 males (49.1%) and 14,417 females (50.9%). With a population of under 30,000 people, Chol Kiri has by far the smallest district populations in Kampong Chhnang province. The average household size in Chol Kiri is 5.8 persons per household, which is significantly larger than the rural average for Cambodia (5.2 persons). The sex ratio in the district is 96.3%, with slightly more females than males.  Murder over burials  On July 6, 2008 a farmer named Lon Chak died from axe wounds to the head in Prey Kiri village, Chol Kiri district. His uncle An Lonh confessed responsibility for the crime to local police. Lonh reported that the crime stemmed from a long-standing dispute with his nephew. The dispute between the two relatives was over burying bodies on farmland belong to Lonh. Lonh reported to police that Chak had already buried two of his relatives on the land against Lonh's wishes. After Chak buried a third body, Lonh attacked his nephew with an axe.

Kampong Leaeng District is the northernmost district of Kampong Chhnang. The district shares a border with Kampong Thom province to north and east. Much of the district is low-lying floodplain and the Tonle Sap river runs through the district roughly from north to south. In the south of the district are two significant mountains. Phnom Chrak Tunling and Phnom Neang Kangrei both over 1000 metres in elevation. The district has very little road infrastructure. There is one provincial ring road that circles the small mountains in the district's south. This road is accessible from National Highway 6 in Stueng Saen District of Kampong Thom. Settlements are located along this road or along the Tonle Sap river and various smaller tributaries. Kampong Leaeng District is the second largest district in Kampong Chhnang province by land area and only Tuek Phos is larger. However, it has the smallest district population in the province after Chol Kiri due to its flooded landscape and lack of road transport infrastructure.  Diarrhoea epidemic  In 2008, Kampong Leaeng was the site of a diarrhoea epidemic that struck down over 100 people in Samraong Saen commune. As safe potable water sources are rare in the district people had been taking drinking water from stagnant ponds. This contaminated water was believed to have caused the epidemic. Forty six people were affected by the water in the first 24 hours and three days later the toll had risen to 113 people. Medical staff from Kampong Chhnang hospital were dispatched by boat to stay in the commune to provide treatment and monitor those affected. Five people became seriously ill and were hospitalised.  Location  Kampong Leaeng district lies in the north of the province and shares a border with Kampong Thom province. Reading from the north clockwise, Kampong Leaeng borders with Kampong Svay, Stueng Saen, Santuk and Baray districts of Kampong Thom from the north to the east.

The colour is olive green or yellowish-brown, mottled with brown patches. The legs have transverse bars of brown. When sitting on alga covered rocks it is well camouflaged. Distribution and habitat The Sri Lanka rock frog is endemic to south, central and western Sri Lanka where it is found in wet tropical forests at altitudes of up to above sea level. It is a largely aquatic species and occurs in fast flowing mountain streams, under boulders and on wet rocks beside waterfalls. It is also found on land in disturbed areas where there are suitable breeding locations such as wet seeps. The tadpoles are semi- terrestrial and are sometimes found on wet rocks beside torrents. Biology The female Sri Lanka rock frog typically spawns a cluster of eggs in a crevice in the splash zone of a mountain stream. The male frog guards the eggs in several nests and ensures that they are kept moist while the female plays no further part in parental care. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that forage for small invertebrates on the surface of the rocks near their nest. Status In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Nannophrys ceylonensis is listed as Vulnerable. This is because numbers seem to be declining and it has several disjunct populations, the total area of its range being less than 2,000 square kilometres (770 square miles). The streams in which it lives and breeds are subject to pollution by agrochemicals and the volume of water is reduced during periods of drought.

It is a colourless liquid with a characteristic acrid odor. It is mainly produced to make acrylate fiber, which is used to weave synthetic carpets. It is also a reagent in the synthesis of various pharmaceutical intermediates. Production The standard industrial reaction for producing methyl acrylate is esterification with methanol under acid catalysis (sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or acidic ion exchangers.). The transesterification is facilitated because methanol and methyl acrylate form a low boiling azeotrope (boiling point 62–63 °C). The patent literature describes a one-pot route involving vapor-phase oxidation of propene or 2-propenal with oxygen in the presence of methanol. Other methods Methyl acrylate can be prepared by debromination of methyl 2,3-dibromopropanoate with zinc.F. Beilstein: Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 3. Auflage, 1. Band. Verlag Leopold Voss, 1893, S. 501. Volltext. Methyl acrylate is formed in good yield on pyrolysis of methyl lactate in the presence of ethenone (ketene). Methyl lactate is a renewable \\"green chemical\\". Another patent describes the dehydration of methyl lactate over zeolites. The nickel tetracarbonyl- catalyzed hydrocarboxylation of acetylene with carbon monoxide in the presence of methanol also yields methyl acrylate.W. Reppe, J. Liebigs Ann. Chem., 582 (1), 116-132 (1953) The reaction of methyl formate with acetylene in the presence of transition metal catalysts also leads to methyl acrylate. Both, the alcoholysis of propiolactone with methanol as well as the methanolysis of acrylonitrile via intermediately formed acrylamide sulfateH.-J. Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 6. Aufl., Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, 2007, . are also proven but obsolete processes. Use Methyl acrylate is after butyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate the third most important acrylic ester with a worldwide annual production of about 200,000 tons per year.CEH Marketing Research Report Acrylic Acid and Esters, SRI Consulting, Juli 2007. Methyl acrylate reacts catalysed by Lewis bases in a Michael addition with amines in high yields to β-alanine derivatives which provide amphoteric surfactants when long-chain amines are used and the ester function is hydrolysed subsequently. Amphotere beta-alanine Methyl acrylate is used for the preparation of 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate by transesterification with dimethylaminoethanol in significant quantities of over 50,000 tons / year. Methyl acrylate is used as a comonomer in the polymerization with a variety of acrylic and vinyl monomers. In doing so it has a similar range of uses as ethyl acrylate.DOW Methyl acrylate, Product Safety Assessment When using methyl acrylate as comonomer resulting acrylic paints are harder and more brittle than those with the homologous acrylates. Copolymerizing methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile improves their melt processability to fibers, which could be used as precursors for carbon fibers. Acrylates are also used in the preparation of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers typically by Michael addition with a primary amine. Methyl acrylate is the precursor to fibers that are woven to make carpets. Owing to its tendency to polymerize, samples typically contain an inhibitor such as hydroquinone.  Reactions  Methyl acrylate is a classic Michael acceptor, which means that it adds nucleophiles at its terminus. For example, in the presence of a base catalyst, it adds hydrogen sulfide to give the thioether: :2 CH2CHCO2CH3 \\\\+ H2S → S(CH2CH2CO2CH3)2 It is also a good dienophile. Safety It is an acute toxin with an (rats, oral) of 300 mg/kg and a TLV of 10 ppm.

It was endemic to Sri Lanka. The species was first identified in 1882 by George Boulenger and named after the German- born British zoologist Albert Günther. It is not known where in Sri Lanka the specimens were found.Manamendra-Arachchi, K. & de Silva, A. 2004. Nannophrys guentheri. In: IUCN 2010. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2010.3. Downloaded on 7 October 2010. Taxonomy Nannophrys guentheri has not been observed since the type specimens were collected. These are poorly preserved and might not be distinct from Nannophrys ceylonensis. Genus Nannophrys used to be placed in the large frog family Ranidae but a phylogenetic study was undertaken using DNA sequences and it is now included in the family Dicroglossidae. Description Nannophrys guentheri was a small species, with snout to vent length given as 28.5 mm for males. Vomerine teeth are in two indistinct groups behind the choanae (the inner part of the nostrils). Lower jaw has slight traces of bony prominences in front. Head is rather small and not bony. Snout is short, rounded, with angular canthus rostralis. Interorbital space is narrower than the upper eyelid and tympanum is not distinctly defined. First finger is shorter than second and the difference of length between the first and second fingers is much greater than that between the second and third. The tips of fingers are pointed, while the toes have a short, but very distinct web at the base. Subarticular tubercles of fingers and toes are not well developed: inner metatarsal tubercle is elongate and rather indistinct while there is no outer tubercle. The hind limb being carried forwards along the body the tibiotarsal articulation reaches the tip of the snout. Skin is strongly tubercular above and smooth beneath. A fold of the skin unites the posterior edges of the upper eyelids, and extends from the eye, over the tympanum and to the shoulder. Upper parts are brown and marbled with darker colour. The upper lip and the sides of body and limbs have small light spots ; the hind limbs are cross-barred. The underside of the frog is uniform whitish. Males have two internal vocal sacs. The longer hind limbs and the smaller head give this species a much more slender appearance than the related Nannophrys ceylonensis: the proportions of the fingers are also important differences between the two species.

While other parts of the city are also targeted by the initiative, its Downtown Eastside area is notorious across Canada for its deep problems with poverty, substance abuse, prostitution, violent crime and homelessness, and the agreement’s stated goals include promoting the health, safety and economic and social well being of the neighbourhood. The initial five-year agreement began in March, 2000 and expired in March, 2010. On May 6, 2005, the Vancouver Agreement received the United Nations Public Service Award for \\"Improving transparency, accountability and responsiveness in the public service\\". On September 1, 2004, it received the Institute of Public Administration of Canada's Innovative Management Award. Public safety The initiative's programs aimed at public safety include the Enhanced Enforcement Initiative, which co- ordinates efforts between the Vancouver Police Department, the BC Liquor Control and Licensing Branch, and Citizenship and Immigration Canada to target businesses that either have ties to organized crime or exploit individuals who are vulnerable due to mental illness or addiction. Also developed under the agreement is the Vancouver Police Department's Keep Exploited Youth Safe program, designed to protect sex trade workers from violent crime, which has been adopted by many other police departments across Canada. Physical redesign of public spaces has also been part of the initiative's strategy for public safety and security. The Carrall Street Greenway, built between Gastown and Chinatown, was meant to deter crime by creating a more open and attractive space. The corner of Hastings and Main, traditionally the site of a major open drug market, has also been redesigned to discourage illicit use. Housing The Vancouver Agreement also supports programs to improve the quality and availability of housing on the Downtown Eastside. The initiative's policy is to find ways of improving the quality of housing without making it inaccessible to the low-income residents who have traditionally been attracted to the DTES for low rents. The Single Room Occupancy project, a collaboration of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, BC Housing and the City of Vancouver Housing Centre, has refurbished DTES hotels to ensure livable conditions for at-risk tenants. The repurposed Woodward's building, which will include 200 units of social housing alongside market-price condos and commercial office and retail space, is another Vancouver Agreement project.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats of Maharashtra state, India. The species is found near torrential hill streams in tropical moist evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, a habitat that is threatened by habitat loss and pollution. Its name honours Humayun Abdulali, an Indian biologist. Description N. humayuni is a plump frog with prominent, forward-facing eyes with vertically slit pupils, a wide head, and rounded snout. The fore limbs are short and plump, and the flattened fingers have large discs on the tips. The hind limbs are rather longer, the toe pads are also disc-shaped, and the toes are fully webbed. It grows to a length of about , the back is a mottled dark grey or brown, the belly is paler grey, and the limbs sometimes have dark bands. The male has orange glands on his thighs and has no vocal sac. Distribution and habitat N. humayuni is found in the Indian state of Maharashtra, in the Western Ghats, and in Goa and Karnataka states at elevations of above sea level. Part of its range is in the Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary and the Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary. It lives in or near fast-flowing, rocky, mountain streams where it hides under rocks and in crevices. It favours forested areas with dense vegetation hanging over the water, and is sometimes found at forest edges away from streams. It has been found in a large cave near Mahabaleshwar, occupying a cave ecosystem alongside Beddome's leaping frog (Indirana beddomii). The cave has a stream flowing through it, and the numerous fulvous fruit bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) that roost there have created a deep bed of bat droppings, which is inhabited by many invertebrates on which the frogs feed. Reproduction Breeding takes place during the monsoon season between May and September. The male maintains a territory, positioning himself on a twig or leaf overhanging a stream and calling repeatedly. The female arrives in response to these calls and deposits a small clutch of eggs on the exact spot from which the male was calling. She then returns to the stream and he stands over the eggs and fertilizes them. He then moves to a new position with potential for egg deposition a few centimetres (inches) away and starts making his advertisement call again to attract another female. In this way, the male decides where the eggs are to be laid. This is the only known Old World frog species where the male and female do not engage in amplexus, the mating behaviour in which the male frog grasps the female round the body and fertilizes the eggs as they are laid. After 12 to 15 days, the developing tadpoles emerge from the jelly-clad eggs and drop into the stream below, where they continue their development. Status Although locally common, the number of Nyctibatrachus humayuni frogs is declining slowly. The species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because its range is fragmented and amounts to a total area smaller than . Its habitat is being degraded by deforestation, agricultural activities, pollution, and disturbance by humans.

The original German text, which is notable for its clarity, was prepared by a group led by Colonel General Ludwig Beck (1880–1944) who was later executed by the National Socialist regime for his part in the 1944 plot against Hitler. The original publication consisted of a two-part, soft cover, pocket-sized manual, which was issued to all commissioned officers and senior non- commissioned officers. It contained basic military doctrine for the German land forces (') from its first publication up to the end of World War II. The book was known by the nickname \\"Tante Frieda\\". A modified form is still in use today by the Federal German Army ('). The approximate equivalent U.S. Army field manual was FM 100–5, now re-issued as FM 3–0, Operations (with later revisions) and available for download at the U.S. Army website. The British Army equivalent manual is Field Service Regulations, also available for download at the British Army website. Background von Moltke's Instructions for Large Unit Commanders, 1869 ' has its doctrinal origins in the late 19th century Prussian Army although its traditions go back to the Scharnhorst reforms of 1810–1812. The modern basis of this Field Manual can be seen in the reforms of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder in the mid 19th century. It was in Moltke’s \\"Instructions for Large Unit Commanders\\" and his concept of separated armies from which modern German doctrine emerged. The system of moving units separately and concentrating as an army before a battle, resulted in more efficient supply and lower vulnerability to modern firepower. To enable a successful flanking attack, he asserted that concentration could only take place after the commencement of a battle. This was a development of the Scharnhorst concept of \\"March Divided, Fight United\\". A consequence of this innovation was the commander's loss of overall control of his forces, due to the limits of means of communication which, at that time were visual (line-of- sight) or couriers, either mounted or on foot. The traditional concept of the elimination of uncertainty by means of total obedience became obsolete and operational initiative had to be delegated to a point further down the chain of command. In this new concept, commanders of distant detachments were required to exercise initiative in their decision making and Moltke emphasised the benefits of developing officers, who could do this within the limits of the senior commander’s intention. He accomplished this by means of directives stating his intentions, rather than detailed orders and was willing to accept deviations from a directive, provided that it was within the framework of the mission. Moltke held this view firmly and it later became a fundamental of all German military theory. Other theorists were critical but Moltke’s insistence that local commanders be allowed freedom of action, has been defended by many German writers together with the concept that large armies made a loose style of command necessary. Prussian and German Field Service Regulations published after 1870 confirm this concept and it is listed, word for word, in ' of 1933: Details Section 15 > Every man, from the youngest soldier upward, must be required at all times > and in all situations to commit his whole mental, spiritual and physical > strength. Only in this way will the full force of a unit be brought to bear > in decisive action. Only thus will men develop, who will in the hour of > danger maintain their courage and decisiveness and carry their weaker > comrades with them to achieve deeds of daring. > The first criterion in war remains decisive action. Everyone from the > highest commander down to the youngest soldier, must be constantly aware > that inaction and neglect incriminate him more severely than any error in > the choice of means. Originally published in German as > Heeresdienstvorschrift 300: Part 1 (1933) and Part 2 (1934). (emphasis in > the original text) At the beginning of the First World War, the German armed forces were using a set of Field Service Regulations which had been issued in 1905. Their doctrine drew heavily on Clausewitz and von Moltke the Elder but the main influence was that of General Alfred von Schlieffen, then Chief of the General Staff. Many in the German army of the period did not accept some of Clausewitz's concepts such as the importance of the defense and the relationship between war and politics. Although the traditional image of stagnation and trench warfare is correct, this period also produced many of the tactical concepts which are associated with modern warfare. On the defense (1915–1917) they pioneered and mastered: flexible defense, defense-in-depth and reverse-slope defense. On the offense in 1918, they perfected fluid non-linear infiltration tactics supported by artillery (cf. Stormtrooper). After the end of World War I, the Reichswehr, under the direction of General Hans von Seeckt, very carefully studied the conduct and developments of the war. The result of the von Seeckt reforms was the new tactical doctrine manual H. Dv.487, Führung und Gefecht der verbundenen Waffen (\\"Command and Battle of the Combined Arms\\"), now generally known as das Fug, published as Part 1 in 1921 and Part 2 in 1923. An important introduction in the post-World War I reforms was the introduction of Auftragstaktik, which can be translated as \\"Mission Command\\" (U.K. forces definition) or \\"Mission-Type Orders, or Directive Control\\" (United States forces) and mission-type tactics (Federal German Army). The principle is that the senior commander states his intention (the mission) to his subordinate commanders. He informs them of the mission, the available means and the timeframe within which the mission has to be accomplished. He then places mission planning and execution in the hands of his subordinates and holds himself available to offer helpful advice and suggestions, but only if requested. > For ' to work, it is necessary that a subordinate leader, or even a common > soldier, has to fully understand the commander’s intent, also to the next > higher level of command, and the purpose of the mission. If he does not > understand, then he has the obligation to ask. In 1925, von Seeckt noted > The principal thing now is to increase the responsibilities of the > individual soldier, particularly his independence of action, with the > profitable result of increasing the capability of the individual. Impact The impact of das Fug and ' on the Reichswehr and later the Heer, was wide-ranging. #The delegation of command responsibility throughout the army, as necessary for the accomplishment of a mission and, if required, down to the individual soldier. #The removal of social barriers between officers and men where the command relationship is based upon mutual respect, trust and confidence, as described in Truppenführung sections 7 and 12. #The preparation for the introduction of aircraft, armored units and combined-arms units some years before the first armored division was formed in the Heer. #The concept that the conduct of operations cannot be defined or laid down in field manuals, or other regulations which inhibit a commanders’ flexibility. Truppenführung in this sense was not a set of rules but rather a set of intellectual tools which could be consulted at any time and which would provide intellectual stimulus in any given situation. The unpredictable and chaotic nature of warfare is specifically referred to in the following sections of the manual (quoted in full): Lynne-Rienner Edition 2001 Section 2 The conduct of war is subject to continual development. New weapons dictate ever-changing forms. Their appearance must be anticipated and their influence evaluated. They must be placed in service quickly. Section 4 Lessons in the art of war cannot be exhaustively compiled in the form of regulations. The principles enunciated must be applied in accordance with the situation. Simple actions, logically carried out will lead most surely to the objective. Section 6 The command of an army and its subordinate units requires leaders capable of judgement, with clear vision and foresight, and the ability to make independent and decisive decisions and carry them out unwaveringly and positively. Such leaders must be impervious to the changes in the fortunes of war and possess full awareness of the high degree of responsibility placed on their shoulders. On leadership and the qualities of officers Section 7 An officer is in every sense a teacher and a leader. In addition to his knowledge of men and his sense of justice, he must be distinguished by superior knowledge and experience, by moral excellence, by self-discipline and by high courage. Section 8 The example and personal bearing of officers and other soldiers who are responsible for leadership has a decisive effect on the troops. The officer, who in the face of the enemy displays coolness, decisiveness and courage, carries his troops with him. He also must win their affection and earn their trust through his understanding of their feelings, their way of thinking, and through his selfless care for them. Mutual trust is the surest foundation for discipline in times of need and danger. On the value of the individual soldier Section 10 The decisive factor, despite technology and weaponry, is the value of the individual soldier. The wider his experience in combat, the greater his importance. The emptiness of the battlefield (die Leere des Schlachtfelds) requires soldiers who can think and act independently, who can make calculated, decisive and daring use of every situation and who understand that victory depends on each individual. Training, physical fitness, selflessness, determination, self-confidence and daring equip a man to master the most difficult situations.. Section 12 Leaders must live with their troops and share in their dangers and deprivations, their joys and sorrows. Only thus can they acquire a first-hand knowledge of the combat capabilities and needs of their soldiers. The individual is a part of the whole and is not only responsible for himself alone but also for his comrades. He who is capable of more than the others, who can achieve more, must guide and lead the inexperienced and the weak. Out of such a foundation grows genuine comradeship, which is as important between the leaders and the men as it is among the men themselves. As Matthew Cooper states in his book The German Army 1933-45, > \\"On the question of tactics, die was a brilliant exposition of modern > principles and drew sound lessons from Germany’s terrible experience in the > 1914-1918 war. Initiative, decisive manoeuvre and envelopment were the > keynotes of the German tactical doctrine. Its success in the war years was > to prove immeasurably superior to the methods of its enemies\\" ' today is still widely considered to be one of the most influential military manuals ever produced. Surprisingly, until 2001 very little of its text was available in English except for some roughly translated excerpts and hand written notes in U.S. military archives and Gen. Wedermeyer's report on the Prussian General Staff College. Equally surprisingly, the manual was classified by the United States military authorities until 2001 when the first full English translation was completed.

It had its own printing press for issuing revolutionary literature, and published the newspapers Rabotnik (\\"The Worker\\") and Listok Rabotnika (\\"The Worker's Paper\\"). Initially, the Emancipation of Labour group directed the Union and edited its publications. But afterwards opportunist elements ('the young' or Economists) gained the upper hand within the Union. In the spring of 1898, the first congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party recognised the Union as the party representative abroad. At the first congress of the Union in November 1898, the Emancipation of Labour group announced that it would no longer edit the publications of the Union. The final break and the withdrawal of the group from the Union took place at the second congress of the Union in April 1900; the Emancipation of Labour group and its followers walked out of the congress and set up an independent organisation, Sotsial-Demokrat. From April 1899 to February 1902 the Union published Rabocheye Delo (\\"The Workers' Cause\\") in Geneva. It was edited by Boris N. Krichevsky, Aleksandr S. Martynov, Pavel F. Teplov and Vladimir P. Ivanshin. In September 1900, the 5th International Socialist Congress of the Second International, held in Paris, set up the International Socialist Bureau, the permanent organisation of the International, with representatives of all socialist parties adhered to it. Each country was to send one to three representatives to each plenary meeting, held every year. Russia initially sent Georgi Plekhanov, of Emancipation of Labour, and Boris Krichevsky, editor of Rabocheye Delo, both of whom were in opposing sides of the conflict within the Union. Krichevsky remained a member of the Bureau from its formation until the 2nd meeting, in December 1902. Plekhanov was a delegate various times between the foundation and 1912.

Under his tenure, Ballet Austin has been invited on four occasions to perform at the J.F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. His ballets are in the repertories of such companies as The Hong Kong Ballet, American Ballet Theatre Studio Company, The Atlanta Ballet, The Milwaukee Ballet, Washington Ballet, Cuballet in Havana, Cuba, BalletMet Columbus, The Dayton Ballet, The Sarasota Ballet of Florida, Ballet Pacifica, Dallas Black Dance Theater, The Louisville Ballet, The Nashville Ballet, Fort Worth/Dallas Ballet, The Sacramento Ballet and Dance Kaleidoscope. Career Early years Following ten years of study in the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Mills started dancing at the age of 18. As a dancer Stephen Mills performed with a wide variety of companies such as the Harkness Ballet and The American Dance Machine under the direction of Lee Theadore. He also performed with the Cincinnati Ballet and The Indianapolis Ballet Theater before becoming a part of Ballet Austin 1986. Mills has danced principal roles in the George Balanchine repertoire as well as works by Choo-San Goh, John Butler, Ohad Naharin, Vicente Nebrada, Domy Reiter-Soffer and Mark Dendy. Dance and ballets Mills choreographed his first work Red Roses to the music of Edith Piaf in 1989 for Ballet Austin. He has created more than 50 works for companies across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998 Mills was chosen to represent the United States through his work, Ashes, at Les Rencontres Chorégraphiques Internationales de Seine-Saint-Denis in Paris. Mills choreographed several works for Ballet Austin as Resident Choreographer before being named Artistic Director in 2000. As Resident Choreographer he created works such as: A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Cinderella with the music of Alexander Glazunov. In his inaugural season as artistic director in 2000, Mills released a world-premiere production of Hamlet. He has worked in collaboration with such artists as DJ Spooky on Echo Boom, visual artist Trenton Doyle Hancock on Cult of Color: Call to Color, eight-time Grammy Award-winning band, Asleep at the Wheel on Big Sky, Shawn Colvin, flamenco artist José Greco on Bolero and award-winning Austin composer Graham Reynolds on Bounce, Though the Earth Gives Way, Cult of Color: Call to Color, and Belle REDUX/A Tale of Beauty & the Beast. Light / The Holocaust and Humanity Project One of Mills’ most significant works is his original ballet Light / The Holocaust & Humanity Project . This full-length contemporary ballet is one piece of a community wide educational initiative around The Holocaust. The work was imagined as a way for art, specifically dance, to convene a broad conversation about The Holocaust and contemporary issues of genocide and human rights. “Mills created the confrontational, distinctly contemporary ballet in 2005 after spending 18 months researching the Holocaust, when Germany's Nazi party exterminated more than 6 million Jews during World War II. The ballet is set to contemporary music by Steve Reich, Evelyn Glennie, Michael Gordon, Arvo Part and Philip Glass.\\" In 2005, Light / The Holocaust and Humanity Project was featured in KLRU's Arts In Context Ballet Austin’s Light / The Holocaust and Humanity Project which won a Lone Star Emmy Award in the Magazine Format Program category. KLRU won a second Lone Star Emmy Award for their segment Producing Light, also depicting Mills’ ballet.

The chalice is of Anglo- Saxon design, and has probably been at Kremsmünster Abbey, Austria since shortly after it was made.  History  Dating from c. 770-790 AD, the chalice was donated by Liutperga, wife of the Bavarian Duke Tassilo III, possibly on the occasion of the establishment of the Benedictine Abbey at Kremsmünster in 777. The chalice is composed of an egg-shaped cup, a large knop (ornamental knob), and a relatively narrow foot (base). The chalice is cast in bronze that has been gilded with gold and silver and decorated by various methods, including niello engraving and chip-carving. It stands 25.5 cm high, and weighs 3.05 kg; its cup holds approximately 1.75 litres. The interlinked oval medallions round the cup show Christ (together with the initials \\"I\\" and \\"S\\", for Iesus Salvator) and four Evangelist portraits, each Evangelist with his symbol. Round the base are icons of the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and, according to an uncertain interpretation, the Lombard queen Theodolinda. The interlace decoration which covers most of the rest of the exterior contains some animals.CR Dodwell, Anglo-Saxon Art, A New Perspective,pp 208-9; 1982, Manchester UP, Around the foot is the Latin inscription: TASSILO DUX FORTIS + LIVTPIRG VIRGA REGALIS. The chalice is an outstanding and original object, possibly made by Northumbrian craftsmen, decorated with Hiberno-Saxon ornament typical of the period. The style is more typical of the Anglo-Saxon rather than Irish component of this hybrid style. There is evidence that monks themselves were trained as goldsmiths in the insular period, like St. Dunstan, a 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury, and Salzburg for example, was a centre of the Anglo-Saxon mission. The care and artistry with which it was worked and the rich decoration show that it was the product of the highest craftsmanship of the day. Although church synods held in the 8th and 9th centuries expressly prohibited the use of copper and bronze for use in consecrated chalices, this is one of a few surviving examples of such vessels from that time.Abbery page The character of the ornamentation shows clearly the predominance of Insular and Anglo-Saxon influences, even though it may have been made on the Continent. Its place of manufacture is uncertain, and it may have been produced in northern Italy, but Mondsee or Salzburg have also been suggested. Together with the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice and associated paten, all of Irish origin, it is one of the most impressive of the very few surviving large pieces of Insular church metalwork – most examples of the style are secular brooches.Michael Ryan in: Susan Youngs (ed), \\"The Work of Angels\\", Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork, 6th-9th centuries AD, 1989, British Museum Press, London, . The survey here (pp 125-8) lists only five Irish chalices from the 8th and 9th centuries, and does not include the Tassilo chalice. Anglo-Saxon metalwork was highly regarded as far away as Italy, and especially noted for its engraving, but even fewer pieces have survived than from Ireland.Dodwell op cit pp.188-215, esp. 202-210 References Bibliography *G.

Over the course of the original series and a 2008 revival, twenty- three events were conceived. Each event was scored, with the objectives for scoring differing from event to event. When the original series premiered in 1989, points were awarded in multiples of five. Following a reconfiguration of the show's format in 1990, points were awarded in numbers ranging from one to ten; this carried over for the remainder of the original series and the 2008 revival. The number of events per episode ranged from six to eight on the original series depending on the season, while the 2008 revival ranged from five to seven depending on the season and round of play. The one constant was the final event, The Eliminator. Assault Years active: 1989–96, 2008 The contender had 60 seconds to hit a target using a series of projectile weapons, while avoiding high-speed tennis balls being fired at them by a Gladiator using an air-powered cannon. The course spanned the entire arena floor with each weapon located at a safe zone that provided some cover for the contender. Each successive station brought the contender closer to the Gladiator's cannon, and traveling to each one required the contender to cross open space where the Gladiator had an unobstructed shot at the contender. The contender's run ended immediately if he/she hit the target or was hit by the Gladiator's fire. In the first half of season one, there were four safe zones consisting of a pillbox (where the contender started the event, weapon in hand), a burnt out building, a thatch bush, and two oil drums, and four weapons (see chart below). If the contenders hit the bull's eye on the target, which was located at the foot of the Gladiator's platform, they would receive 100 points. Hitting the outer rim was worth less points, originally 60 and rising to 75 by the end of the season. If the contender fired all four weapons unsuccessfully, he/she could take cover in the last safe zone until time expired to earn 30 points for a draw. From the second half of season one onward, the course consisted of five safe zones and five weapons. The contenders also had to run to the first safe zone instead of starting at it, and the target was moved above the Gladiator's head. A finish line was also added after the last weapon station, and contenders had to cross the finish line within the allotted time in order to earn a draw. Other changes made over the course of the series: *For the second half of season one and all of season two, hitting the outer rim of the target was worth seven points and the bull's eye worth ten. Crossing the finish line at the end of the course earned the contender four points and a draw. *Beginning in season three and continuing for the rest of the original series and the revival, all target hits were worth ten points. If they failed to hit the target, contenders were awarded one point per weapon fired. A draw awarded an additional point for a total of six points. *Beginning in season five the contenders had to hit an actuator at the end of the course in order to earn a draw. *In season one of the 2008 series, each weapon had to be loaded by hand and several smaller barriers were added to further aid the contenders. The second season returned to having the weapons pre-loaded, with the exception of one.

The object for the contenders was to roll their spheres into any of four octagonal scoring pods while the Gladiators used their spheres to impede the contenders' progress. In the first year that Atlasphere was part of the event rotation, the scoring pods had a large circular depression in the middle. The contenders had to roll into the pod and settle their sphere into it for one second in order for a score, which would be indicated by a blast of nitrogen \\"smoke\\" from the center of the pod. This caused problems for some contenders as they could not generate enough momentum to get out of the pod and would become stuck for an extended period. For season three, the pods were redesigned to prevent contenders from getting stuck. In addition, an actuator was placed in the middle of each pod and all a contender had to do to score was touch it, which would trigger a ring of chase lights and a plume of smoke to indicate the score. 1, 2, or 3 points were awarded for each score, depending on the season and round of play. After season five of the original series, Atlasphere would not be played again until season two of the 2008 series. For the final two seasons of the original series, Snapback took its place in the event rotation. Breakthrough & Conquer Years active: 1989–96 Breakthrough & Conquer was a combination of American football and freestyle wrestling. The event was divided into two parts, each scored separately. This was also an event that the show did not initially allow female contenders to compete in; for portions of the preliminary rounds in 1989 a different game was played off screen (see Swingshot). In Breakthrough, the contender began at the 15-yard line of an artificial turf field and had to carry a football into the end zone for a touchdown. A Gladiator was positioned inside the five-yard line and had to remain there until the contender reached them. The contender scored by getting any part of the ball over the goal line without being tackled, going out of bounds, or losing hold of the ball. The contender then moved over to a circle to grapple with a second Gladiator for 10 seconds (15 in season four). The contender won by forcing any part of the Gladiator's body to touch the floor outside the circle. If the contender was forced out, they could re-enter the circle and keep grappling until time expired. In the first half of season one, 30 (later 40) points were given for each successful part, and a contender earned bonus points if they were successful at both parts for a total of 100 points. From that point forward, 5 points were given for each successful portion of the event (although 3 were given during a point in season three). Also in the first half of season one, the series experimented by having the Conquer circle elevated; this forced contenders to take the Gladiator completely out of the circle to win. A protective mat was placed on the floor below for safety. The experiment, which took place during the semifinal round of competition, ended badly after one of the female contenders pulled Gladiator Sunny out of the circle from the front, causing her to land awkwardly; Sunny suffered a severe knee injury as a result and left the series altogether. After a commercial break, the original non-elevated Conquer circle was re-instated. Earthquake Years active: 2008 In Earthquake, a contender and Gladiator attempted to throw each other off of a moving twelve-foot circular platform above the arena floor and either onto crash mats (season one) or into water. In order to win the event, one had to be completely removed from the platform and not be hanging onto anything supporting it. The contender received ten points for throwing the Gladiator off the platform and five for lasting the entire thirty seconds. Gauntlet Years active: 1993–96, 2008 In this event, the contenders had to run through a half-pipe chute while avoiding five Gladiators, all holding blocking pads to impede the contender's progress. 25 seconds were given to start. If the contender made it out in time or without being forced out of the chute, they earned 5 points. If they made it out in under 20 seconds, 10 points were awarded. In the final season of the original series, the event was played with four Gladiators, and the time limits were reduced to 15 seconds for 10 points, and 20 seconds for 5. For the 2008 series, the contenders were given thirty seconds to negotiate the Gauntlet, which was redesigned to take away the Gladiators' ability to push the contenders out of the chute. For the first season and the preliminary rounds of the competition, contenders received two points for passing each Gladiator for a total of eight, and then two more for breaking through a wall at the end after passing the last Gladiator. For the remainder of the series, the timed scoring rules were revived with contenders receiving ten points for escaping within twenty seconds and five for escaping within thirty. Hang Tough Years active: 1990–96, 2008 Hang Tough saw the contenders use a series of hanging gymnastic rings to swing themselves from one side of the arena to the other with the object being to reach and land on a platform on the opposite side while trying to avoid being taken off the rings by a Gladiator or falling off on their own. The contenders were given sixty seconds to reach the opposite end and received ten points if they did. If they lasted the whole sixty seconds and were still on the rings, they received five points for a draw unless the official determined that they did not make enough of an effort to advance, resulting in no points being awarded; this rule was instituted after several early playings saw contenders only go out a short distance from their platform. It also gave rise to a short-lived seven point draw possibility, which required the contender to advance to the closest rings to the Gladiator's platform (which were color coded). Contenders were required to continue moving as long as they were not stuck on one ring or engaged with a Gladiator, and neither the contender nor the Gladiator could stay in one place for more than ten seconds. Gladiators were not allowed to contact the contenders above the shoulders or pull the contestant down by their uniform, or they would be disqualified. Hang Tough debuted on the 1990 alumni show season premiere, but did not join the event rotation until the second half of the season began in 1991. Hit & Run Years active: 2008 Hit & Run was one of several events that the 2008 series adopted from the UK series. The event took place on suspension bridge hanging above a water tank. At each end of the bridge was an actuator and each time a contender crossed the bridge and pushed it, two points were scored. Meanwhile, four Gladiators attempted to knock the contenders off by throwing 100-pound wrecking balls at them. The contenders were allowed to duck to avoid the balls but had to remain standing at all times otherwise. The event went on for sixty seconds or until the contender fell from the bridge. Human Cannonball Years active: 1989–90 (through first half of season two), 1992–93 The object of this game was simple: swing on a rope from an elevated platform and try to knock a Gladiator off a pedestal some distance away. The Gladiator was given a blocking pad for protection. Originally, three Gladiators played this event and contenders received three swings. For the first half of season one, each successful swing was worth 30 points and 10 bonus points were given if the contender managed to knock all three Gladiators off the pedestal. In the second half of season one, this was reduced to three points for each swing and one bonus point for knocking all three off. After that, two Gladiators competed in the event and contenders were given five points for each successful swing. After the preliminary round in the first half of season one, a rule was added that forbade contenders from leaving a tucked position while swinging; the rule was put in place out of safety concerns raised after Gladiator Malibu suffered a gash caused by contender Brian Hutson hitting him in the face with his feet extended. Any contender who did not remain in this position for the entire swing had the results of their swing disallowed. A first season addendum also called for removal from the event for a second offense, which happened to contender Elden Kidd in the second half of the season when he committed two fouls against Gladiator Titan.https://www.youtube.com/americangladiators; \\"The Dirtiest Contender\\". Human Cannonball was replaced by Hang Tough in the rotation after the first half of season 2, and was brought back in season 4 before being retired. Joust Years active: 1989–96, 2008 The Joust saw the contender and Gladiator face off against each other with pugil sticks for thirty seconds. In the first half of season one, the event was conducted on an apparatus resembling a bridge. To win the event, either the contender or Gladiator could knock the other off of the bridge or advance on them and try to get them to cross a line behind them. This was supposed to trigger a trap door, which would open and drop the loser onto the floor, but it rarely worked properly. In addition, each contender was guaranteed points regardless of the result. The scale started at 30 points and increased by 5 for every five seconds a contender stayed in the bout. Draws were worth 75 points and a victory was worth 100. Beginning in the second half of season one and continuing across the remainder of the original and revival series, the object became to knock the opponent off of a pedestal onto a crash pad (original series) or into a pool (revival). Ten points were awarded for a win, with five for a draw. Several things could result in a disqualification, such as: *dropping the pugil stick (the initial half season also required both combatants to keep both hands on their sticks at all times) *actively grabbing the opponent's pugil stick out of their hands (the only instance in which losing one's own pugil stick did not lead to being disqualified) *touching the opponent's pedestal with any part of the body *failure to mount an offensive effort *both knees touching the pedestal (2008 revival) *losing one's protective helmet In the second half of season three the contenders and Gladiators began wearing gloves while Jousting. This rule was instituted after contender Marek Wilczynski had to have the tip of one of his fingers amputated when it got jammed against his pugil stick. The Maze Years active: 1991–93 A giant maze was constructed across the entire length of the arena floor, and the contenders were given 45 seconds to negotiate their way through it. Inside were four Gladiators, armed with blocking pads to impede their path. To aid the contenders each Gladiator was restricted to a particular area in the maze and could not chase the contenders past it. In each playing of The Maze, there were only two correct paths to take, and with movable partitions inside the maze those two paths were different each time. The first contender to escape in time earned 10 points, with the second earning 5. Powerball Years active: 1989–96, 2008 Regarded as a signature event of the whole series, Powerball was an event where the contenders attempted to score by depositing red and blue colored balls (originally rubber play balls, then soccer balls and finally much smaller Nerf balls) into narrow cylinders while trying to evade three Gladiators who defended the playing field. In the first half of season one, Powerball was conducted on a half-circle shaped field with two bins filled with balls at one end and the scoring cylinders laid out on the edge of the circle at the other end. Each score was worth 15 points and for 45 seconds, the contenders would grab balls from their respective bins and try to score while the Gladiators attempted to stop them by any means possible (tackling, pushing the contender out of bounds, etc.) so long as they were not excessively rough with the contenders; if any Gladiator was determined to have violated this rule, the contender was rewarded with a score. In the second half of the season, the Powerball field was extended to take up the entire length of the arena floor and the layout of the scoring cylinders changed and one was placed in the middle of the field, with any ball deposited there worth more points. In addition, the ball bins were placed on opposite ends of the field and the contenders had to alternate which bin they chose balls from. The Gladiators were not allowed in these areas. Also, penalties for rough contact now resulted in a Gladiator being removed from the event and all tackling was banned; with the exception of the tackling ban, these rules remained in place for the remainder of the original series (Gladiators were forbidden to tackle above the shoulders, though). In the second half of the first season, goals in the four outer cylinders were worth one point and the center cylinder was worth two. After that, the scoring varied from 1–3 points for outer goals and 2–5 for center goals depending on the season and round of play. Beginning in the second season, Powerball began using scoring cylinders with a wider, rounded bottom; the original cylinders were prone to falling over and breaking if contenders and Gladiators knocked them over. The 2008 series' Powerball game was played for 60 seconds on a field had a retaining wall placed around it, which took away the out of bounds option for the Gladiators. For the first season, goals were worth two points for the outer cylinders and three for the center, and the cylinders had wider openings to encourage contenders to attempt to toss their scoring balls into them. The second season discarded that in favor of the original cylinder style and goals were reduced to one point for the outer cylinders and two for the center. ;Super Powerball (1992–93) Introduced in season four of the original series, Super Powerball was a variant on the original event played with two Gladiators and three scoring cylinders laid in a straight line in the middle of the field. Three points were awarded for goals in the left or right cylinders, and five points were awarded for center cylinder goals. If a Gladiator committed a violation the contender was credited with a score. Pyramid Years active: 1993–96, 2008 The contenders faced a pyramid made out of tiered crash mats and were given 45 seconds to try to ascend it. Two Gladiators stood in their way, attempting to prevent them from reaching the top. At the top of the Pyramid was an actuator (originally a ring bell) that the contenders were required to hit to score. The first contender to do so scored ten points, and the second contender to do so earned five points. The 2008 series increased the time limit to 60 seconds and adapted a rule from the British series for scoring purposes. The fourth tier from the top had a white dotted line placed on it, which was referred to as the \\"scoring zone\\". If either contender reached it, they would score five points. Five additional points would be scored, and the event would end, if a contender reached the summit and hit the actuator. The British series called the fourth tier from the top the \\"safety step\\" and instituted this after Diane Youdale, who portrayed female Gladiator Jet, was forced to retire from the series after suffering an injury on their Pyramid. The rule that the Gladiators could not chase contenders above the step was not adopted as contenders would have an unfair advantage. Also in 2008, the Pyramid became part of the Eliminator course at the end of each episode. (See the Eliminator section below.) Rocketball Years active: 2008 Rocketball was an event that saw the contenders face off against two Gladiators in a high flying basketball game. Each player was attached by harness to a bungee cord. The contenders each had a bin of colored balls that they would try to place in one of two colored baskets, one red and one yellow, hung from the ceiling of the arena. To do this, they would press a button on the stage floor which would launch them toward the baskets. The Gladiators, meanwhile, had buttons of their own and would use theirs to launch themselves up to play defense. The process repeated itself for sixty seconds. For each ball the contenders put in the red basket, which was the higher basket, two points were awarded. Each ball in the lower yellow basket was worth one. Sideswipe Years active: 2008 A new event for Season 2, Sideswipe has both contenders hopping or running from platform to platform above the water as they try to take a colored ball from a container on one end of a line of five platforms and deposit it in a \\"bullseye\\" goal at the other end. While the contestants are transporting the balls, three Gladiators try to knock them off the platforms by swinging at them on rope swings – with the Gladiators themselves being the projectiles.Sideswipe page on NBC.com Sky Track Years active: 1992–95, 2008 In the version of Sky Track played on the original series, the contenders and a Gladiator raced each other on an inverted, Velcro-covered track. Using their hands and feet (each covered in Velcro to assist in moving), they would move down the track to the opposite end, hit an actuator button, then turn around and head back to the start/finish line. There were three possible outcomes to every race and they were scored in the following manner. *Gladiator finishes first: the contender who crossed the line in second place received five points. *One contender finishes ahead of Gladiator: the contender is awarded ten points for winning the event. *Both contenders finish ahead of Gladiator: the first contender to finish receives ten points, and the second receives five. The 2008 series adopted the format used on the British series. Here, both contenders were chased by a Gladiator over a figure-eight shaped track and had to make one lap around the track. Each contender wore a harness with a ripcord on it, which the Gladiators would try to grab. If they did, the contender would be disconnected from the track and lose the event. Ten points were awarded for completing the course first, with the second contender receiving five. Snapback There were two different events called Snapback played on American Gladiators. This debuted in season six of the original series, replacing Atlasphere in the event rotation, and was played for the remainder of the series. The second was part of the 2008 series. ;Original Snapback The contenders faced two Gladiators, with all attached to bungee cords. The object was to run out onto the field of play and grab large red and blue scoring cylinders that were hung above the field, using the bungee cord for assistance. The Gladiators tried to impede the progress of the contestants and/or knock the cylinders away. Once the contender had a cylinder, they would bring it back to a large scoring bin and drop it in if they kept possession of it. The red cylinders were hung lower than the blue ones and were worth two points (later one) for each one retrieved. The higher- hanging blue cylinders were worth three points (later two) as they were tougher to grab. ;2008 SnapbackSnapback – from nbc.com The 2008 edition saw the contenders try to hit a red button at the end of a -long lane. Each contender was attached to a Gladiator with a bungee cord, with the Gladiator providing resistance by pulling on the cord from a platform above the floor. Contenders were given thirty seconds to reach the buttons, and if they did the Gladiators would be launched across the arena. There were four scoring zones along each lane, and if any part of the contender's body was in one of those zones, which ranged from two to eight points in two-point increments, when time expired they received that number of points. Swingshot Years active: 1991–96 The contenders faced three (later two) Gladiators in a 45 (later 60) second event. The object for the contender was to jump from a platform using a bungee cord, use their momentum to propel themselves from the floor to a cylinder with red, yellow, and blue colored scoring balls, grab one, then spring back to their platform and deposit them in a bin. The Gladiators were there to try to block the contenders from doing so. 1 point was awarded for each yellow ball grabbed, since they were the lowest level and easiest to grab. The blue balls were on the second level of the cylinder, and were worth 2–3 points. The red balls were highest on the cylinder and were worth 3–5 points. Contenders were required to jump off their platforms immediately once in the position to jump, and could not throw off a Gladiator's timing by \\"faking\\" a jump. If they did, any balls they scored on the ensuing jump would not count. In the first half of season one, the name Swingshot was given to a game strictly played by the female contenders in the early rounds of play in place of Breakthrough and Conquer. Footage of the game was never shown, only how the contenders did. The game was eventually discarded in favor of having the women play Breakthrough and Conquer with the men, so there is no record other than the offhanded mentions of how the game was played. Tug-O- War/Tilt Years active: 1993–96 (as Tug-O-War), 2008 (as Tilt) The contender faced a Gladiator in a two-man tug of war on tilting platforms for thirty seconds. In the original series, the platforms were at equal height and the contender started tilted back with the Gladiator starting tilted forward. The object was to pull the Gladiator off the platform, which was worth ten points. A flag was placed in the middle of the rope and the contender could earn five points for a draw if they stayed on the platform for the entire thirty seconds and had the flag on their side of the arena. Neither the contender nor the Gladiator could let go of the rope, as doing so would result in a disqualification. In the 2008 series, which saw the event adopt its British series' name, the rope was attached to two harnesses worn by the contender and Gladiator and the Gladiator's platform was raised above the contender's to put them at a disadvantage. Ten points were awarded for a win and staying on the platform for the entire thirty seconds earned the contender a draw. Vertigo Years active: 2008 Vertigo was another UK series import added to the 2008 series rotation. The event was a race between the contender and Gladiator on a course of seven poles hung from the roof of the arena. Each participant had their own set of poles to traverse. The race started with the contender and Gladiator climbing up the first pole, and from there they had to maneuver from pole to pole and reach a hoop at the end of the course. The first to pull their respective hoop won the race. The contenders earned ten points for winning. If the Gladiator won, the contenders could still add five points if they had reached the fifth pole before the race ended. The Wall Years active: 1990–96, 2008 The Wall saw contenders trying to ascend a rock- climbing wall without being pulled off by a pursuing Gladiator. The original series conducted the event on a structure. The height of the wall during the first season of the 2008 series was high, and it was extended to for the second. Debuting in the first half of season one, the time limit for The Wall was two minutes. The contenders were also given a head start on the Gladiators, with the men receiving fifteen seconds and the women ten. Beginning in season two, and continuing across both the original and revival series, the limit was set at one minute. Originally, the head starts were carried over and both men and women contenders received ten seconds with the exception of a brief spell in season four when fifteen seconds were given. In season five of the original series, The Wall was given an overhaul. The Wall was divided into five sections, with grips placed on the dividers so participants could cross between sections. The contenders started in the second and fourth sections, respectively, while their assigned Gladiators started in the outermost sections. The contenders and Gladiators each started climbing their assigned partitions, with no head start for the contenders. To pull their contender off the Gladiators had to cross over at least once. The contenders, meanwhile, were able to cross over to the center partition and force their Gladiator to cross two partitions to pull them down. When the series returned in 2008, The Wall's previous format returned with it but with only a seven-second head start given. Ten points were given to the first to successfully ascend The Wall and five were given to the second if both made it. For the first two seasons (and very briefly in season four), the higher advancing climber earned five points if both were pulled off. The 2008 series awarded five points for staying on The Wall without being pulled off for the entire time. Whiplash Years active: 1993–96 The contender and Gladiator stood atop a diameter circular platform, with each participant having one hand strapped to a handle of a triangular apparatus referred to as the “dog bone”. The event was played for thirty seconds, with contender and Gladiator pulling on their sides of the bone in an attempt to break the other's grip and thus “own the bone”. Neither participant could place their free hand on the bone, and doing so resulted in a disqualification. For the first two seasons of Whiplash, each participant had different objectives. The contender could win by either “owning the bone” or using it to pull the Gladiator off of the platform, scoring ten points in either instance. All the Gladiators were required to do was remain on the platform for the full thirty seconds to win, although they could also win by “owning the bone”. For the seventh season, the rule was changed and the Gladiator could only win by “owning the bone”. If the Gladiator was still on the platform when time expired, the contender was awarded five points for a draw. The Eliminator The Eliminator served as each episode's final event and was the only event where the contenders faced off directly with each other instead of against the Gladiators. The Gladiators would still participate but as the years went on they were involved less and less. The Eliminator was an obstacle course laid out over the entire arena floor. The obstacles used varied from year to year. 1989–91 For the first two seasons the Eliminator was played for points like every other event. Both contenders started at the same time and had to complete the course within a time limit. That limit was sixty seconds for the men for the first two seasons, while the women had sixty in the first season and seventy-five in the second. The points scale was different from the other events. A contender's score was determined by how much time was left on the clock when the course was finished. Each second earned the contender two points (five in 1989). However, there were penalties assessed to contenders if they either failed to complete obstacles in the proper manner or fell off of them. These added five seconds to the contenders' finishing time for each violation, which meant a loss of ten points from the overall Eliminator score (twenty-five in 1989). Prior to the Eliminator, the deficit between the leader and the opponent was divided by the appropriate point scale and in order for the trailing contender to win the match, he/she needed to not only finish the course first but do so in enough time (once penalties were factored in) to earn enough points to overtake the leader. For example, in the first half of season one, a trailing contender behind by 25 points would need to make up five seconds. In the second half of the season a ten-point deficit would require the same amount of time. Once both contenders finished the course and the scores were totaled, the contender leading won the match and advanced in further play. If the match ended in a tie, the contender with the faster Eliminator time won. On the occasion that a contender was unable to run the Eliminator due to injuries sustained in the earlier parts of the competition, the opposing contender automatically advanced to the next round. In the preliminary rounds, that contender would be required to run the Eliminator as seeding for the quarterfinals were determined by score totals from the preliminaries. If a contender was forced to withdraw before the Eliminator at any subsequent point in the competition, the opponent would advance by forfeit and no Eliminator run would take place. The first season's Eliminator featured the following obstacles: *An inclined ramp that the contestants climbed while pushing giant medicine balls, which had to be placed in holders at the top *A pair of pits to cross: **First pit crossed with a balance beam, with six Gladiators swinging smaller medicine balls at the contenders to impede progress **Second pit crossed using commando line ropes *The \\"swing for life\\", a rope swing over a small wall *A set of cylindrical \\"cones\\" which had to be weaved through *A choice of two corridors for each contender, with a paper door at each end; one door was clear while a Gladiator with a blocking pad stood at the other The second half of the first season saw the balance beam and commando line sections lengthened and the top rope was raised to aid taller contenders. The run to the finish also changed to have narrower corridors, and one additional Gladiator was added to the mix leaving only one of the four doors clear. For season two, the Eliminator saw an overhaul with new obstacles and the finish line was moved from the front of the arena to the back. These were the changes made: *Two reverse treadmill belts were built into the ramp, and contenders were given three chances to reach the top before being allowed to walk upon the side *To get across the first pit a hand bike was used *The balance beam was used to cross the second pit, with a Gladiator at the end of each beam with a weighted blocking pad waiting *A cargo net climb to a platform, where the contenders rode a zip line back to the floor *Two track hurdles were placed in front of the corridors, which were otherwise unchanged 1991–93 Beginning with the first episode of the third season and continuing for the remainder of the series, the Eliminator was no longer scored. Instead the leading contender was given a head start of half a second for each point he/she led by entering the event and the opposing contender had to make up the deficit. Whoever finished the course first won the match. With the third season came some changes, many of which remained in place for season four. The layout of both courses, with corresponding changes, follows: *Falling off the hand bike resulted in contenders being detained by Gladiators for several seconds. The women were held for ten seconds, the men seven. *The balance beam was removed and replaced by spinning cylinders. Falling off the apparatus forced contenders to use an unsteady rope ladder to climb back up. *The old corridors were done away with in favor of several new obstacles. The season three course featured two padded walls, one with a step, and a straightaway above which two Gladiators stood with giant medicine balls, which they would throw at the contenders. After this, the contenders would vault over a hurdle, where a short run to the finish line awaited; the first contender to reach the finish would break through a strip of yellow tape before crossing. Some early episodes instead featured only the stepped wall, with two Gladiators on the other side forming a gauntlet with giant medicine balls to impede their path, and then a short hurdle to the straightaway; this was quickly done away with in favor of adding the second padded wall after the zip line. In season three, the distance between the final hurdle and the finish was short enough to allow for contenders to make desperate leaps to try to cross the line first.1991 first half semifinal matchup between Tim Goldrick and Coz Worthington; Worthington attempts to overtake Goldrick with a leap but does not. Airdate c. December 1991. In fact, that season's Grand Championship was decided in such a manner; Mark Ortega was able to pass Joseph Mauro after jumping over the final hurdle and landing with his body across the finish line before Mauro broke the finish tape. In season four, the contenders once again faced the gauntlet after climbing what was now a Plexiglas wall. This time, a series of blocking pads were hung from the ceiling of the arena and the Gladiators would operate it using handles to push and pull the pads so they would swing. The final hurdle was moved up slightly so the contenders had a longer run to the finish and could not leap across as easily. 1993–96 In keeping with the aesthetic overhaul AG went through at the start of its fifth season, the Eliminator too was given a makeover inspired by the British Gladiators course in use at the time. While most of the course remained the same, three new obstacles were added in season five and a fourth in season seven. In seasons five and six, the Gladiators' involvement was limited to \\"enforcing\\" the time penalties for falling off the hand bike. (The Gladiators were removed altogether for season seven (penalties would be enforced by game judges) as well as both seasons of the 2008 revival.) *To start the event the contenders were placed at the bottom of a tower and had to climb it using a modified Versaclimber fitness machine. They then used a slide to get to the platform in front of the handbike. *The treadmill ramp was moved to serve as the penultimate obstacle following the wall climb. The belts were slowed and contenders were given two attempts to scale the ramp. Once they did, they swung on a rope through a paper barrier to finish the event. *In season seven, the spinning cylinder was removed and two ball pits were installed. The contenders were required to wade through them and climb out to reach the cargo net. International tournaments For both International Gladiators tournaments, which were held in the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, England where the British series taped, the Eliminator course from that series was used and consisted of these obstacles. *Contenders started by negotiating a set of four hurdles, with two high and two low. They had to climb over the high hurdles and roll under the low ones. *In order to get to the platform in front of the pit, a climbing rope was used. *Both sets of contenders crossed the pit in a different manner. The men used the hand bike, while the women used a monkey bar-style apparatus called a hand ladder. *Once across the pit the next three obstacles were the same as the American series: a run across the spinning cylinders, a climb up the cargo net, and a zipline ride to the floor. *Once off the zipline each contender had to negotiate a balance beam. *The treadmill followed, but keeping with British custom it was referred to as the Travelator. *Once atop the Travelator a rope swing through a paper barrier was the finish. 2008 Version The 2008 series used the same scoring rules that were in place from 1991 onward on the original series. For the 2008 version, the layout was as follows. Season 1 * The course began with contenders climbing an wall. A rope was available for assistance. *Once over the wall the contenders jumped into a long pool with a wall of fire on top, which they swam under. *They would then climb a cargo net to get to the next obstacle. *The Barrel Roll was next; the contenders had to grab and hold onto a cylinder as it rotated downward. *The handbike followed with no specific penalty enforced for falling. *After the handbike contenders negotiated a downhill balance beam. *This placed the contenders at the base of the Pyramid, which they had to scale to reach the zipline. *The last obstacle was the Travelator (adopting the treadmill's UK name). The belts were much narrower and contenders had a rope to use for assistance, but the previous series' free pass rule was not in place. After the Travelator, a small set of stairs led to a series of crash blocks that the contenders had to break through to finish, and the first contender to do so won. If the second contender was still on the Travelator when the first contender broke through, the second contender could opt to have the Travelator turned off. Season 2 For season two, these changes were made. *The wall was taken out and the swim under the wall of fire doubled in length. *The Barrel Roll was replaced by a rope swing. *The commando lines last seen in season one returned and were referred to as the Tightrope. The major difference was that instead of a straight line walk, the ropes were slanted downward. *Two deep ball pits were placed below the handbike, and contenders had to wade through them if they fell. *The downhill balance beam was replaced with a spinning cylinder, which was called the \\"Rolling Pin\\". The series opted to use another balance beam, called the \\"Teeter Totter\\" after its mechanism of action, as an obstacle before the Travelator; this was another nod to the British series (which called the obstacle the \\"seesaw\\"), which adopted the mechanism toward the end of its run. *After the stairs, the finish reverted to the one seen on the last three seasons of the original series, with a rope swing through a paper barrier into the pool. Pyrotechnics would go off for the first person to break through the barrier.

The specific name liebigii honours a certain \\"Dr von Liebig Jr.\\", likely referring to Justus von Liebig, German botanist and chemist. Description Nanorana liebigii are relatively large frogs: adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is stocky. The head is wider than it is long, and the snout is rounded. The tympanum is faintly visible. The toes are fully webbed. Skin is rough with scattered warts on the back and sides. Tadpoles have long tail that is twice as long as the body, for maximum total length of about . Habitat and conservation Eggmass deposited in a stream Tadpole undergoing metamorphosis Nanorana liebigii is found in stream habitats in high-altitude shrubland at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place in streams, and the eggs are deposited in water under stones. Eggs clutches contain some 80–140 white eggs. Males have been reported to guard the eggs, but this behavior is not ubiquitous. Nanorana liebigii is common in parts of its range, but is considered rare in Tibet. It is locally threatened by habitat loss caused by clearance of shrubland and changes in waterway management, such as dam construction. Furthermore, in Nepal, Nanorana liebigii is collected for human consumption, and is also alleged to have therapeutic benefits; this practice can lead to local depletion. It is present in some protected areas, including the Yadong National Nature Reserve (Tibet), Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve (India), and Manaslu Conservation Area (Nepal).

Mataco was laid down on 27 June 1942 by United Engineering Co., San Francisco, California; launched on 14 October 1942, sponsored by Miss Evelyn B. Piper; and commissioned on 29 May 1943, Lt. William G. Baker in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Following shakedown off San Diego, California, Mataco early proved her endurance when she towed a floating drydock 43 days nonstop from San Francisco to Brisbane, Australia, arriving on 1 October 1943. This passage accounted for 6,800 of 55,000 miles steamed her first year.  Salvage in combat areas  Mataco underwent her first air attack in the Ellice Islands on 17 November, and three days later stood by to aid ships invading the Gilberts. Training and target towing in Hawaiian waters preceded her joining task force TF 53 for the invasion of the Marshalls. She stood off Kwajalein on 31 January 1944 to screen transports, free beached landing craft, and send her divers to recover documents from sunken Japanese ships. Mataco was redesignated ATF-86 on 15 May. She carried out escort and towing missions in the Marshalls and to the Gilberts, Marianas, and Pearl Harbor until 3 December, when Ulithi became her base for the next six months.  Missed by a torpedo  In January 1945 she carried out a major salvage assignment at Leyte, in February she made a tow to Saipan and Guam, and in April she joined the assault on Okinawa. There on 2 April an aerial torpedo passed harmlessly beneath her keel.  End-of-war operations  Mataco pitched in on the enormous amount of salvage work to be done around Okinawa, and at the war's end began tows to Japan. She returned home as she had come to war, towing a drydock from Guam via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California, where she moored 25 July. Five months later, on 19 December, she returned to the western Pacific on the first of the annual deployments to the U.S. 7th Fleet which alternated with U.S. West Coast and Alaskan duty.  Korean War service  She was in the Philippines at the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, and after investigating smuggling in the Ryūkyūs, sailed to Korea, where she performed combat salvage and air sea rescue missions beginning with the 15 September Inchon landings. In mid-October she rounded the peninsula, extending those services to Wonsan. Target towing missions in Japan and between Guam and Pearl Harbor completed this tour, and she arrived in San Diego, California, 12 August 1951. Mataco began her next western Pacific deployment on 10 January 1952 and during the next 14 months supported United Nations forces in Korea, in October twice rendering fire support at Pippa Kotsu. The next year she reported for three continuous years of Far Eastern service, and from 1956 to 1966, made five additional U.S. 7th Fleet cruises as well as serving in Alaskan waters for four extended periods.  Vietnam War operations  On 29 February 1967 she began a tour which brought her for the first time to the coast of embattled Vietnam. On 21 April Mataco brought YFR-890 in tow to Vũng Tàu, and in May took up fishing trawler surveillance on Yankee Station. After towing a damaged LST from Da Nang to Guam in July, she trained Korean navy men in salvage in Chinhae, then returned San Diego on 6 November. In March 1968 the Mataco began her second West-Pac tour towing the YD-91 floating crane to Guam. On to Subic and pick up a floating hospital barge to tow to Danang. Then on to Yankee Station to provide specialized electronic cover with the 7th Fleet. An at sea mishap caused the loss of radar capabilities and shortened the time on station.

It is endemic to western Nepal. Its type locality is the eponymous Rara Lake located in the Rara National Park. Description Adult males measure , subadult males , and subadult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is not very distinct whereas the supratymapnic fold is prominent. Adult males have enlarged forelimbs. During the reproductive period, adult males have black, horny nuptial spines on their chest and forelimbs. The fingers are not webbed. The toes are long and webbed to their tips, although the webbing is strongly incurved between the toes. Preserved individuals are greyish above and have warts with blackish spots. There are numerous blackish markings on the head. The upper parts of the limbs have crossbars. The lower parts of the body and the limbs are whitish, while the throat is greyish. The tadpoles of Gosner stage 37 measure about in total length and in body length. They have a large oral disc and a muscular tail with not so well-developed caudal fin. Nanorana rarica, also known as Rara Lake frog, was first collected from Rara Lake. Habitat and conservation The habitat and ecological requirements of this species are poorly known. It is known from the Lake Rara at an elevation of about above sea level, and is associated with tropical montane forest. Threats to this species are not known. In addition to the Rara National Park, it might also occur in the Chitwan National Park.

About The Geauga County Public Library (GCPL) includes five full-service branches in Bainbridge, Chardon, Chesterland (Geauga West), Middlefield, and Thompson; a fleet of Mobile Services vehicles that serve rural areas and community centers; and an Administrative Center where technical services, computer services, facilities and administrative functions reside. GCPL has more than 900,000 books and ebooks. The collection also contains more than 100,000 audio / video items and 60 Research databases available through its website. GCPL is a member of the Clevnet consortium, giving patrons access to more than 12 million items. Learn more about the Geauga County Public Library at GeaugaLibrary.net History On August 26, 1848, the Chardon Public Library was organized at the meeting of interested persons at the Geauga County Courthouse. John French, County Recorder, was chosen Librarian. Donated books were housed in the Recorder’s Office and were administered as an association library with membership fees. The library collection grew and was moved several times before a village library in the Village Hall was established and a library board was appointed in 1913. In 1929 the Village Council established the legal status of the library by creating it as a municipal institution. In 1936, intangible taxes were received for the first time, and service to county schools began. Library extension services were established throughout the county during the succeeding years. A branch library was established in Middlefield in 1942. Library service in Chesterland got its start in the late 1940s when a dedicated resident, Mary Eykyn, delivered books to the township’s children at the Chester summer day camp in her own home-made version of a bookmobile — a modified baby buggy outfitted with bookshelves to hold around 100 books borrowed from the Chardon Branch. A branch library was established in Chesterland in 1957. In 1963, the library was designated a County District Library by the County Commissioners at the request of the Library Board. A new seven-member Library Board of Trustees was created and the name Geauga County Public Library became its official designation. The Bainbridge Branch was so cramped for space, that the poetry collection was housed in the men’s rest room. Geauga County Public Library continued to grow with the establishment of the Bainbridge Library in 1965. The Chardon Branch moved into its present building on Chardon Square in 1970 and has been renovated several times over the years to meet service demands and space needs. The Chardon Branch houses the major genealogy and local history collection for the Library system in the Anderson Allyn Room. GCPL partners with the Geauga County Genealogical Society to provide the service and collection. The Thompson Library Station in Ledgemont High School opened in 1979. Before GCPL’s Geauga West Branch was established, the Chesterland location was known as the “Chester Branch Library.” Gardens for reading and learning were introduced at some of the branches. In 1991, the Bainbridge Branch and the Chagrin Valley Herb Society formed a partnership so that an herb garden could be installed for learning and enjoyment. This garden has received regional recognition in herb and horticultural circles. The Friends of the Geauga West established a reading garden in the front of this branch in 2005 and in 2008, Middlefield received a READ Garden which was paid for in part by the East Geauga and Bookmobile Friends. Then in 2009, the East Geauga Friends of the Library donated a bronze sculpture that was installed at the entrance to the Middlefield Library. Construction at the Bainbridge site gave the community a 10,000-square-foot building. The Library system experienced flat funding from the State throughout the late 1990s and into the new century, which led to a return to the polls for a replacement levy in 2007. Bainbridge and Geauga West received interior face-lifts thanks to an LSCA – Trading Spaces grant awarded in 2007. The projects were successfully completed in 2008. More cuts to State funding occurred in 2009, which led to cuts in library services and staff reduction in hours and layoffs. After gathering community input at public forums, a new continuing 1 mill levy was approved by the voters in 2010, which resulted in the restoration of library services and staffing in 2011. A capital project plan was put in place so the Library could begin to tackle a backlog of maintenance issues and projects, among them purchasing property in Bainbridge in 2013 in anticipation of providing much-needed space for the undersized Bainbridge Branch. Chardon’s rules of the library in the 1960s. How far we’ve come! The library built its e-content collection by subscribing to various services to offer e-books, e-audiobooks, digital magazines, movies. television shows and comics and graphic novels. Staff members were trained to help teach patrons how to use this technology on their devices. GCPL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013 with a major system-wide marketing plan. The Anderson Allyn Genealogy and Local History Room at the Chardon Branch were renovated in 2014 to accommodate new tools and collection formats used for research using a gift from the Allen estate donated to the GCPL Foundation. Voters passed a bond issue in 2017 to renovate Chardon, Geauga West, and Middlefield as well as build new library branches in Bainbridge and Thompson. Planning began shortly thereafter and progress has been chronicled on the #GCPLBuilds web page. Additionally, the library underwent strategic planning in 2018 and adopted the mission to “engage, connect and inspire.” References External links * Geauga County Public Library Home Page * * Category:Public libraries in Ohio Public Library Category:1848 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Geauga County Public Library"},{"id":"12406865","text":"Nanorana rostandi (common names: Dubois' paa frog, Rostand's paa frog, Dubois' frog) is a species of frog in the family Dicroglossidae.

He does not appear in any other records for nearly 20 years. In late 1530 he turns up at Badajoz Cathedral, teaching plainchant to the choirboys. The year 1539 finds him singing in Palencia Cathedral, where he became known as a composer. He then seems to have gone to Madrid in 1541, but by 1545 he was back in his native city of Badajoz as the cathedral's chapel master (Maestro de capilla). From 1551, he was on the payroll of Seville's Don Antonio de Zuñiga, to whom Vásquez dedicated his collection that year of Villancicos I canciones. It's thought that Vásquez remained in Seville until his death. In 1560 all his secular compositions were published in Recopilatión de sonetos y villancicos. Music His sole surviving work of sacred music is the Agenda defunctorum (Office of the Dead) of 1556. In this work primarily for four voices (some sections included three voices and others five) Vásquez not only demonstrated his ability with extended forms of music but also conveyed his facility for counterpoint and his beautiful and melodious lines. Cantus firmi are apparent in this work but he used them intermittently in all of the voices at various places.AOL Music's Vásquez biography The music employs both plainchant and polyphony, with his best and most extensive use of polyphony to be found in the Missa pro defunctis from that collection. The Office of the Dead is very highly regarded for its contemplative qualities, standing well alongside Vásquez's elegantly simple songs which have more reputation today. The bulk of Vásquez's compositions are ingeniously writtenHOASM.org's Vásquez page secular villancicos (approximately 90 in total), employing texts by leading Spanish poets of the day. Most of the music is formally typical but qualitative aspects of his music included easy counterpoint, textual emphasis with care given to the music for this purpose and delightful variations. Many of them also include folk poetry and allude to Spanish folk song styles, and they seem to have been quite popular during the composer's lifetime.AllClassical.com's Vásquez page Agenda defunctorum Vásquez's setting (published in 1556) is remarkable for being part of a complete Agenda defunctorum that included Matins and Lauds in addition to the more usual Vespers and Mass. In the first publication, the original Sevillan chants appear alongside their polyphonic elaborations. It was in Spain and Portugal that the tradition of stile antico requiem settings had the greatest longevity, its ramifications extending well into the next century (as with Tomás Luis de Victoria's setting), and, through the colonial possessions of both countries, into new continents as well. The service seems to follow the example of Morales closely, and indeed both were written for Seville. Vásquez composed his imposing Agenda defunctorum in 1556 in Sevilla. For the text Vásquez has chosen parts out of the Officium Defunctorum of the Seville Cathedral. Versions of most of these chants can be found in the modern Liber Usualis. This work by Vásquez consists of six parts: Inventorium (Invitatory), In Primo Nocturno (first night), In secundo Noctruno (second night), In tertio Nocturno (third night), Ad Laudes (laude), and Missa pro defunctis. The musical items not set polyphonically by Vásquez would have been performed using their original plainchant, possibly with improvised polyphony. The items which Vásquez set whose corresponding chants can be found in the Liber Usualis are the Invitatory, Psalm no.5, nine antiphons, five lessons, one Responsorium, the Canticum Zachariae, the Requiescant in pace, Amen and the Missa pro defunctis. Vásquez has written this Agenda defunctorum for four voices (SATB). In most of the pieces from the Agenda defunctorum, Vásquez uses the homophonic and polyphonic style alternately. The Canticum Zachariae is optimised for alternating between these, in which the strophe with even numbers will be performed by several voices (SATB), and the strophe with odd numbers by one voice. The Responsorium Libera me, Domine is similarly written for alternating plainsong and polyphony. The Graduale is set for three voices (ATB).Asociación Cultural \\"Ubi Sunt?\\" (Spa) Discography Dedicated discs *Agenda Defunctorum: Capilla Peñaflorida, Josep Cabré.

It is known under many common names, including Chinese spiny frog, giant spiny frog, Chinese edible frog, and spiny paa frog. Its names refer to the distinctive characteristics of the species, relatively large size and the spiny chest of male frogs. Giant in frog terms only, it can nevertheless grow to lengths above ; this makes it the largest frog in Hong Kong. Taxonomy Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that Quasipaa spinosa is split in three distinct lineages; the nominal Quasipaa spinosa may thus represent a cryptic species complex. The lineages are geographically distinct; one lineage is found in Yunnan, another one in southeastern China (Anhui, Zhejiang, northern Fujian, and Jiangxi), and the third one in south-central China (southern Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi). In this analysis, Quasipaa exilispinosa is nested within Quasipaa spinosa. It's sibling species is Quasipaa acanthophora from Vietnam. The complete mitochondrial genome (18,012 base pairs in length) of Quasipaa spinosa has been sequenced, helping to shed light into the phylogeny of Quasipaa and related frogs. Distribution and habitat It is found in China south of the Yangtze River, including Hong Kong. It is expected to be found in Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. No certain records exist from Vietnam, earlier records may refer to Quasipaa acanthophora described in 2009 as a new species from that country. It may also have been mixed with Quasipaa verrucospinosa and Nanorana yunnanensis. Quasipaa spinosa is associated with rocky streams in evergreen forests and open countryside on hills and mountains. Its altitude range is about above sea level. Description and life cycle The most distinctive characteristic of Quasipaa spinosa are the keratinized skin spines in the chest of males. It is dark brown in colour, interspersed with dense, yellowish mottling. Quasipaa spinosa are moderately large frogs: males grow to a snout–vent length of about and females to or more, up to in snout–vent length. It is the largest frog in Hong Kong. Later studies has shown that usually males are larger than females, but with considerable overlap between sexes. Body size is positively correlated with maximum temperature and rainfall. Mean body weight among males may reach at least . Quasipaa spinosa breeds in streams, laying the eggs in water under stones. Reproduction takes place in April–October. Male frogs call near slow-flowing sections of streams or around pools adjacent to streams. The advertisement call consists of three to seven notes, the last being the longest. Pairs in amplexus are found within the chorus area. Population demography of Quasipaa spinosa has been studied for two populations in the Tai Mo Shan Country Park in Hong Kong. These populations exhibit high site fidelity. Populations have low densities (13–42 frogs per 100 m of stream) and female-biased sex ratio. Each female produced an average 1.26 juveniles that survived until the age of 2 years. Annual survival was low, 38–65 %. Quasipaa spinosa in its stream side habitat. Utilization Quasipaa spinosa is an important food and medicinal resource in China and considered as a delicacy. Populations are heavily harvested, and overcollection is implicated in population declines. In Jiangxi province alone, the value of production of Quasipaa spinosa for domestic consumption is of the same magnitude as global trade of frog meat. Quasipaa spinosa are also farmed, but farming operations are likely based on tadpoles or juveniles sourced from wild population, instead of captive breeding. Thus, farming may not reduce the pressure on wild populations. Conservation This species is believed to have declined dramatically in abundance. It is classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because the decline is estimated to be more than 30% over the last three generations. The main reasons for the decline is (over)collection for human consumption, and it is also threatened by habitat loss caused by agriculture and dam construction. Moderate levels of exploitation are sufficient to increase extinction risk markedly, at least in small populations. Quasipaa spinosa is not designated as a State Protected Animal in China, and there are no regulations for its protection, except in protected areas. However, sale of wild Quasipaa spinosa is now forbidden in Fujian, and farmed frogs need to be certified.

The company produces contemporary theatre, with a focus on Canadian work.http://www.belfry.bc.ca/about/ The theatre building is a converted nineteenth-century church designed by Thomas Hooper.  Mission  Michael Shamata, the current artistic director of The Belfry, has said that \\"it is my hope that all of the plays that we produce open a door to a new world.\\" The emphasis of the Belfry's productions has been on Canadian work, and the development of new work through \\"commissions, dramaturgy, workshops, readings, and first productions.\\"  Building history  From its construction, between 1887 and 1892, until 1974, the building was the Emmanuel Baptist Church of Fernwood. The church's congregation formed in 1874. They purchased the plot at Fernwood and Gladstone for $550, and dedicated the Spring Ridge Chapel on February 6, 1887. Under supervision of Rev. Peter H. McEwen, construction completed in 1892. The building continued to function as a church for the next 79 years until April 4, 1971, when the congregation moved to a new sanctuary in Sannich. In 1974 the building saw its first use as a theatre space when University of Victoria graduate student Blair Shakel rented out the church's chapel. In 1975 Don Shipley (stage director) formed the Springridge Cultural Centre, based on the model of Vancouver's East Cultural Centre (The Cultch). He would later be joined by Pat Armstrong as co-director of the Belfry Cultural Centre, which would go on to be The Belfry. In 1990 the Belfry company purchased the building. It has since undergone two major renovations, the first completed in 2003, and more recently in 2017.  Production history  The first theatre production put on by The Belfry was Don Shipley's Puttin' on the Ritz, in 1977. Since then the Belfry has produced over 312 plays, of which more than 233 were Canadian, and at least 47 were premieres. Some notable plays that premiered at The Belfry are Dan Needles's Wingfield Farm plays (Wingfield Series), Morris Panych's Vigil, and Michele Riml's plays Sexy Laundry and on the edge.  Community engagement  In accordance to their mission statement, The Belfry has many programs to increase their engagement with the local community. Belfry 101 (and later additions of 201 and 301) is an educational program unique to the theatre. It gets high school students directly involved behind the scenes with some Belfry productions, giving them opportunity to develop their own creative abilities and practice thinking critically. The students also receive discounted season tickets. Additional involvement and community events include a talk back feature called B4Play, post-show talk backs Afterplay and Talkback Thursdays, as well as a variety of online resources, including Heart of the Matter, the Belfry Librarian, and access to digital issues of Upstage their magazine publication. In their 2008-09 Season the Belfry added SPARK festival, in addition to their mainstage shows. SPARK is an effort to support emerging and unique theatre in Canada, and is part of a festival with workshops and free community events.

It is endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago where it can be found in at least Buka and Bougainville Islands of Papua New Guinea and Choiseul and Santa Isabel Islands of the Solomon Islands, but probably also more widely. The specific name heffernani honours Mr. N. S. Heffernan, who collected the type series. Taxonomy Cornufer heffernani was until 2015 known as Palmatorappia solomonis, the sole species of the genus Palmatorappia. In a major revision of family Ceratobatrachidae, Brown and colleagues moved P. solomonis to the genus Cornufer, leading to secondary homonymy with Cornufer solomonis. They solved this issue by resurrecting Cornufer heffernani as a substitute name. Palmatorappia could still be recognized as a monotypic subgenus Cornufer (Palmatorappia). Description Cornufer heffernani has a small, delicate, slender body and limbs. A syntype specimen of Hylella solomonis in the Senckenberg Museum measures in snout–vent length. The head is broader than the body and triangular in shape. The snout is broadly rounded and the eyes are large. The canthus rostralis and the tympanum are indistinct. The limbs are slender. Both the fingers and the toes are webbed and bear well-developed discs. Skin is smooth above but granular on the flanks, the belly, and under surface of the upper arm and thighs. Preserved specimens are purplish brown above and yellow below, fading to yellowish all over with time. Habitat and conservation Cornufer heffernani is a very rare species that is found on low vegetation and trees in tropical rain forests. It can also be found in good- quality secondary forests. It has direct development, that is, it breeds without free-living tadpole stage. It is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging.

He became the chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times in July 2006. In 2016, he won the Orwell prize for political journalism. In the same year, he was awarded with the Commentator Award at the European Press Prize awards. Life and career He was born in England, son of Jewish South Africans, but spent some of his childhood in South Africa. His uncle, Ronnie Hope, was news editor at The Jerusalem Post. He read History at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, gaining a first class honours degree from Cambridge University in 1984. While at Gonville and Caius, he was a friend of future MI6 renegade agent Richard Tomlinson, whom he provided with a reference for his Kennedy Scholarship application. He began his career with the BBC World Service in 1984. From 1988 to 1990, he was a reporter for The Sunday Correspondent, based in Washington DC. He spent 15 years at The Economist; first as its deputy American editor, then as its South-east Asia correspondent from a base in Bangkok. He then served as The Economists Asia editor before taking on the post of Britain editor from 1997 to 2000, following which he was posted in Brussels where he penned the Charlemagne European-affairs column. At The Financial Times, Rachman writes on international politics, with a particular stress on American foreign policy, the European Union and geopolitics in Asia. Gideon Rachman maintains a blog on the FT site. His brother is Tom Rachman, the author of the novel The Imperfectionists. Their sister, Emily, died of breast cancer in 2012.  Views  Rachman is noted for advocating a looser, non-federal European Union. In 2002, he staged a debate in Prospect magazine with Nick Clegg, who was then an MEP for the East Midlands. Clegg argued strongly that Britain should join the European single currency. Rachman disagreed, writing, \\"I believe the political changes involved in joining the Euro carry enormous risks. I do not believe it is 'progressive' or 'self- confident' to take those risks.\\"Nick Clegg: Is joining the euro still too big a risk for Britain?, Prospect (20 January 2002). Retrieved 11 May 2014. More recently, Rachman has argued in the FT that the EU must take a flexible and open approach to the political demands of their member states or face failure. However, during the UK referendum on EU membership, Rachman argued for the UK to vote to stay inside the EU – arguing that the organisation, although flawed, was an important guardian of democratic values and security in Europe. Rachman was also one of the first commentators to predict that the UK would vote to leave the EU. Rachman has a strong interest in East Asia and the rise of China, and has repeatedly warned that inflexibility on the part of both China and the USA may lead to conflict. He has also often focussed on the challenges to US power around the world. Rachman twice endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency and has defended his foreign policy. He has also been sceptical of the case for intervention in Syria.  Books  In August 2016, Rachman published a book entitled Easternisation - War and Peace in the Asian Century. The book argues that 500 years of Western domination of global politics is coming to an end as the result of the rise of new powers in Asia. It focussed on the threat of conflict between the US and China, America's eroding global position and rivalries between China and its neighbours. The book was called \\"masterly\\" by the Sunday Times and \\"superb\\" by the Daily Telegraph. Yale historian, Paul Kennedy, said – \\"This is truly one of those works you can say you wished our political leaders would read and ponder its great implications.\\" Rachman's first book, Zero-Sum World was published in 2010 in the UK. It was published under the title Zero-Sum Future in the US and translated into seven languages, including Chinese, German and Korean. The book was part history and part prediction. It argued that the thirty years from 1978–2008 had been shaped by a shared embrace of globalisation by the world's major powers that had created a \\"win-win world\\", leading to greater peace and prosperity. Rachman predicted that the financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 would lead to a zero-sum world, characterised by increasing tensions between the world's major powers. The New York Times praised the book as \\"perhaps the best one-volume account now available of the huge post- Communist spread of personal freedom and economic prosperity.\\"Diminished Expectations, by Scott Malcolmson, New York Times, 28 January 2011. (review of Zero-Sum Future)  Awards  As well as winning the Orwell and European Press Prize awards, Rachman was named foreign commentator of the year in Britain's comment awards in 2010. The Observer has also listed him as one of Britain's 300 leading intellectuals. He has been a visiting fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University (1988–89) and at the Nobel Institute in Oslo (2013).

The male advertisement call consists of a single note, instead of double notes as in Cornufer wuenscheorum. The dominant frequency is about 3300 Hz. Call series can last tens of seconds, during which the emission rate increases. Habitat and conservation Little is known about this inhabitant of hilly tropical rainforests. The type series from the Cyclops Range was collected at above sea level, whereas the Bewani Mountains record is from above sea level. The eggs are laid on the ground and development is direct, without free-living tadpole stage. The threats to Cornufer cheesmanae are unknown. Its range includes Cyclops Mountains Nature Reserve, but fires and illegal removal of vegetation are encroaching on this habitat.

He was one of three Polish nationals to have won the Speedway World Championship, the others being 2010 World champion Tomasz Gollob and the 2019 Speedway Grand Prix winner and 2019 World Champion, Bartosz Zmarzlik. Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Career Jerzy Szczakiel first appeared in a World Final in 1970 at the Olympic Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland where he was a reserve for the Final but did not ride on the day. He rode in the World Final in 1971 at the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden where he failed to score in his five rides. Szczakiel's next (and last) World Final was in 1973 at the Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, Poland. In front of the largest crowd in world speedway history (estimated to be around 130,000), he scored 13 points, winning his first 3 rides and finishing 2nd in his last two. He won the title after a run- off with the defending champion Ivan Mauger of New Zealand after both riders tied on 13 points. Mauger fell in the run-off, leaving Szczakiel to finish unchallenged and win the championship. Fellow countryman Zenon Plech finished third.http://www.defunctspeedway.co.uk/misc%20page%202.htm Before the meeting, Szczakiel was considered a rank outsider to win the championship with all eyes on Mauger, 1971 champion Ole Olsen, Plech and Swede Anders Michanek. In an amazing turn around of form, just two weeks after winning the World Championship Szczakiel represented Poland in the final of the 1973 Speedway World Team Cup at the Wembley Stadium in London, England where he could not come to grips with the notoriously difficult Wembley track and failed to score a point from his four rides. He finished a distant last in his first race, retired with engine failure in his next two (both times while running last), and was excluded from his last race for breaking the tapes at the start. The Poles finished in last place in the Final behind winners Great Britain, runners-up Sweden, and the third placed USSR.1973 Speedway World Team Cup results Four time World Champion Barry Briggs from New Zealand reported during commentary for ITV of the WTC Final that Szczakiel had a major crash in practice three days earlier when he went over his bikes handlebars in turn one and lacerated his leg, severing a blood vessel. Briggs also helped secure a pair of bikes for the Final as Szczakiel's crashed bike was the only one he had available. Briggs and fellow ITV commentator Dave Lanning surmised that the Pole's confidence was shot following his practice crash which accounted for his poor showing at Wembley, though Lanning was far more scathing of the reigning World Champion. In defence of his World title, Szczakiel was seeded straight to the Continental Semi-final at the Motodrom Halbemond in Norden, West Germany. There he finished 16th and last having failed to score a point and thus failing to qualify for both the Continental Final in Togliatti, Italy, as well as the 1974 World Final in Gothenburg. Szczakiel was also winner of the World Pairs Championship with Andrzej Wyglenda in 1971. He scored 15 points in the final, held at the Rybnik Municipal Stadium in Rybnik, Poland.Martin Rogers (1978). The Illustrated History of Speedway. Studio Publications (Ipswich) Ltd. As a measure of Szczakeil's skill as a rider, between 1971 and 1973 he raced Ivan Mauger 13 times - and won 6, including beating him twice in the 1973 World Final. At home in Poland, Szczakiel rode for second division team Kolejarz Opole in the Druga Liga. He continued to ride for Opole until his forced retirement from a back injury in 1980. He stayed involved with the team as Manager until 1986 and became an honorary member of the club. Restrictions During his career, while other Polish riders such as Zenon Plech and Edward Jancarz were seemingly free to travel the world representing Poland in speedway, Polish authorities would not allow the 1973 World Champion to race anywhere but in Europe and only on rare occasions did he compete in Britain. Following his 1973 World title win, Szczakiel was invited by fellow World Champions Ivan Mauger and Barry Briggs to join their troupe (Ole Olsen, Scott Autrey, Chris Pusey and Bert Harkins) on a world tour to the USA, Australia and their native New Zealand. Polish authorities had other ideas however and vetoed his participation (but allowed both Plech and Jancarz to go on the tour). After his retirement, when asked about not being allowed to compete outside of Europe, Szczakiel said: Personal life Jerzy Szczakiel was married and had three children. In later life he worked as a shoe importer.

The specific name gilliardi honors Ernest Thomas Gilliard, an American ornithologist who, together with Margaret Gilliard, collected the holotype . Taxonomy Cornufer gilliardi was originally described as Platymantis gilliardi based on holotype from New Britain and paratypes from the Admiralty Archipelago. Later research has shown that the Admiralty Archipelago specimens represent other species, Platymantis latro (now Cornufer latro), and that the range of Cornufer gilliardi is restricted to New Britain. Description The holotype is an adult female measuring in snout–vent length. The tympanum and the supratympanic fold are moderately distinct. The eyes are relatively large. The fingers have lateral fringes but no discs. The toes have small terminal discs. The preserved specimen is dorsally gray-brown, slightly paler between the convergent dorsal folds. The chest and abdomen are pale and nearly immaculate. Habitat and conservation The ecology of Cornufer gilliardi is poorly known. It is probably a foothill species occurring in rainforest habitats.

It is located at the southwest end of the Inderøya peninsula in the Utøy area, surrounded on two sides by the Trondheimsfjord. The village sits at the southern end of the Skarnsund strait. Until 1991, when the Skarnsund Bridge opened, Vangshylla served as a ferry and fishing port. Since 1964, it was served by the Vangshylla–Kjerringvik Ferry. It has since been converted into a marina and tourist center with rental accommodation for fishing in Skarnsund. History Vangshylla was originally a croft under the farm Vang vestre.Værdal, 2009: 193 The first written records of Vang date from Archbishop Aslak Bolt's estate records from 1430, where Vang was split in three farms. The word \\"vang\\" means a plain with grass, while \\"hylla\\" refers to a shelf, with Vangshylla being located on a shelf below the other Vang-farms. Vang vestre was first known as Ytra Vang.Værdal, 2009: 191 The first records of Vangshylla being a croft were made in 1661, when it was registered to be leased by a fisher or ferryman.Frisli, 2006: 72 The croft was bought by Soldier Svein Jakobsen Flakkenberg in 1790, and became registered as a farm. Vangshylla is located on southwestern end of Inderøya, and is the closest point to the outer parts of Trondheimsfjord, including Trondheim, as well as to the neighboring villages of Mosvik and Ytterøy. The farmer at Vangshylla operated a ferry service to these communities. The first recorded service was when the minister Jakob Jørgensen Wesseltoft in 1732 fled Inderøy by being rowed to Trondheim. At the time there was no road connection to the other parts of Inderøy. The good fishing in Skarnsundet contributed to creating a landing site for fishers. Larger vessels had to anchor and boats used to reach them.Værdal, 2009: 202 A road from Kvam to Vangshylla was built during the 19th century.Frisli, 2006: 73 The first steamships in regular service up Trondheimsfjord started in 1856. Vangshylla was established as a stop, and the farm-owner Gotvard Hovd was hired to run the port. There were no suitable docks for the ships to land at, so boats were used to freight passengers and cargo out to the ships. Hovd later started a post office. In 1905, Thomas Næss established a general store adjacent to the docks, selling products delivered by ship.Frisli, 2006: 74 During the first decades of the 20th century, Georg Volset operated a motor boat from Vangshylla. The main transport was between Vangshylla, Mosvik and Ytterøy, predominantly due to Mosvik and Ytterøy having a common minister, and Inderøy and Mosvik having a common general practitioner and veterinarian. In 1930, the road to Kvam was expanded to Vangshylla to a quality that allowed motorized vehicles, following a slightly different route. Fylkesbilene i Nord-Trøndelag started a scheduled bus service and Trygve Næss, the oldest son of Thomas Næss, started a taxi service.Frisli, 2006: 75 In 1933, a new store building was built by Næss.Værdal, 2009: 196–197 In 1930, a new dock was built that allowed direct access to land. There were normally three weekly arrivals of the ship from Innherred Dampskibsselskap and the bus. Until the 1940s, these came on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, when the newspapers Nord-Trøndelag and Inn-Trøndelagen were published. These days would assemble people from the area who would collect their mail and newspapers, and conduct necessary purchases.Frisli, 2006: 76 During the 1930s, Anton Ulven started a sawmill at Dalsenget—on the hill above the dock area. This was later moved to Straumen and became Inderøy Trelast. The exports were large enough that separate ships were used for the timber. In 1950, the store was taken over by Trygve Næss and the buses, mail and newspapers started coming daily. During the 1960s, the post office was closed and in 1970, the docks for the liners was demolished. The store ceased operations in 1978, but was replaced by a kiosk that remained until 1991. On 1 February 1958, the company Innherredsferja started a car ferry service from Venneshamn and Kjerringvik via Vangshylla to Ytterøy and Levanger. At first, the service operated five times a day to Kjerringvik and three times a day to Venneshamn, while there were to daily services to Ytterøy and Levanger.Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 17–18 From 1 June 1964, the Vangshylla–Kjerringvik–Venneshamn Ferry started. After the road from Venneshamn to Kjerringvik opened in the last years of the 1960s, the ferry remained with a single service, connecting the two villages on Norwegian National Road 755.Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 27 Four ferries were used on the service: Innherredsferja (1958–69),Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 13–14 Skarnsund (1969–82),Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 31 Mosvik (1982–87)Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 42 and Skarnsund II (1987–91).Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 42–44 The opening of the Skarnsund Bridge in 1991 caused an enormous change in Vangshylla The first meeting of local commercial and political interests to establish a bridge across Skarnsund was made in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by the establishment of the company AS Skarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The bridge cost . In its last year of operation, the ferry service carried 267,894 people, 108,482 cars, 13,878 trucks, 840 buses and 312 motorcycles. The final run of the ferry occurred on 19 December 1991, with Harald V on board.Langfjæran and Hov, 2008: 43–44 The bridge collected a toll until 15 May 2007. Following the closing of the ferry quay, a marina and breakwater was built at the location of the quay. Skarnsundet Fjordsenter was founded in 1992, and five years later opened eight apartments for rental for fishing tourists. The center was expanded in 2006, when a new breakwater, marina, a fishing equipment store and a marine fuel station were erected. Community life The Vangshylla Farm has been split into 72 parcels, of which 31 have been built as holiday homes.Værdal, 2009: 194 Skarnsundet Fjordsenter operates eight apartments adjacent to their marina. This is mainly aimed at fishing tourists who can catch up to 90 species in Skarnsundet. The grounds also host a small camping ground. Vangshylla Båtforening also operates a marina. Skarnsund is the inner-most ice-free part of the Trondheimsfjord during winter. The village also serves divers, and Skarnsund has corals. The old road along the sea from Vangshylla to Kvam has been converted to a hiking trail.

It is endemic to southeastern Luzon, Philippines, where it is known from two volcanos, Mount Isarog (its type locality) and Mount Malinao. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is broadly rounded. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The hind limbs are moderately long. The dorsum has grayish to orange brown background color and is marked with varied darker spots and blotches. Some specimens have a pale vertebral line starting from the beginning on the snout. The hind limbs have dark transverse bars. There are yellowish, brown-ringed s in the groin, on the thighs, and frequently the lower legs. The venter has brown spots or reticulations (this species was originally named as P. reticulatus in reference to the latter). Habitat and conservation Platymantis isarog is an arboreal frog that occurs in mossy and montane rainforests at elevations of above sea level. It deposits its eggs on leaves in shrub layer vegetation. The egg have direct development (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). This species is common in mid- to upper-montane forests on Mount Isarog, and the population there appears to be stable; it is well-protected by the Mount Isarog National Park. There is geothermal power generation on the slopes of Mount Malinao, but its impact is limited. Thus, despite its limited distribution, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group.

British Speedway Who's Who. Career Motorcycle speedway Egon Müller won the German Champion eight times (1973, 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1985). He rode briefly in the United Kingdom in 1973 for the Coatbridge Tigers (Scotland), and in 1976 for the Hull Vikings. Despite him only appearing for a handful of meetings in 1976, Hull were granted a 'Egon Muller (Rider Replacement)' facility for the entire 1977 season. Müller won the Long Track World Championship in 1974, 1975 and 1978. He finished second in 1980 and 1984, and finished third in 1976 and 1982. He also represented West Germany in the Speedway World Pairs Championship, finishing a best of 3rd in 1977 at Hyde Road in Manchester, England paired with Hans Wassermann. Müller also competed in the Speedway World Team Cup where he led the West Germans to a third-place finish in both 1981 at the Speedway Stadion in Olching, and again in 1982 at the White City Stadium in London, England. He was also a four-time winner of the Continental Final which was the last World Final qualifying round for European-based riders. Müller won the Continental Final in 1976, 1981, 1984 and 1985. As of the 2015 Speedway Grand Prix series, Egon Müller is the only German rider to have won the Speedway World Championship when he took out the title with a 15-point maximum at the Motodrom Halbemond in Norden in 1983 from Australian Billy Sanders and 1980 champion Michael Lee. At a time when the Speedway World Championship Final was a single meeting that could throw up a surprise winner on the day, Müller was generally seen as a 'one hit wonder' in the same way that Poland's 1973 World Champion Jerzy Szczakiel was. However, Müller was a perennial championship contender having made four previous World Final appearances (1976, 1977, 1980 and 1981) as well as being a triple Long track World Champion, and an 8 time German Champion. Following the 1983 World Final, rumours surfaced that West German officials had given Müller extra practice time on the Norden track that the other riders were not given. Other rumours also surfaced that many of the riders believed that the track had been prepared more like a long track in order to give Müller an advantage, with the track actually receiving a grade by the tractor after each race. In commentary for British television, 1976 World Champion Peter Collins noted that the Motodrom that day was more like a Grass track than a regular speedway which definitely suited the West German. Just two weeks after his 1983 World Championship win, Müller was reportedly involved in a motor accident on the Autobahn where he wrote off his Porsche. The accident saw him spend a couple of days in hospital with minor leg injuries. Just one week following this, he competed in the 1983 World Long Track final in Czechoslovakia. Müller went on to ride in the 1984 and 1985 World Finals but could not replicate his 1983 win, finishing in 14th place with just 3 points from his five rides on each occasion. Music/actor Outside of his sport career, Muller was a pop singer under the stage name Amadeus Liszt (with some hits like \\"La Donna\\" in 1986, \\"Win The Race\\" in 1987 and \\"The Devil Wins\\" in 1989), a moderator at trade fairs, shows and charity events, an actor and a television personality.

Biography Born in Mattoon, Illinois, he graduated from the Kentucky Military Institute in 1915. He initially joined the Philippine Constabulary before joining the regular army in 1917. In 1941 he served as military attaché to the American Embassy in London before being appointed by general Dwight D. Eisenhower to chief of intelligence for the European theater of operations in 1942. Eisenhower next placed him in charge of the Allied Forces Information and Censorship Section which was responsible for the operation of twelve radio stations as well as the censorship of troop mails and cables. McClure was appointed director of the newly created Psychological Warfare Division of SHAEF in 1944. With the end of the war in Europe he was responsible for the Information Control Division which controlled broadcasting and newspapers in Germany during the early stage of the occupation. After the invasion of Korea in 1950, beginning the Korean War, the Office of the Chief of Psychological Warfare was formed in Washington, D.C., headed by McClure. During his tenure, the Psychological Warfare Center was established at Fort Bragg, North Carolina which centralized the newly formed Psychological Warfare School and 10th Special Forces Group at a single location. In 1952, McClure was assigned to Iran as chief of three U.S. Military Missions, where he played a role in the 1953 d'état and formed a close relationship with the Shah. He retired from the Army in 1956 and died of a heart attack soon after at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

It is the last album to feature the group's classic lineup of Jones, Cropper, Dunn, and Jackson and the first of their albums to contain longer, jam-oriented compositions. Background By 1970, bandleader/keyboardist Booker T. Jones had become estranged from Stax, as he protested the changing atmosphere under the leadership of executive Al Bell.Bowman, Rob (1997). Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records. New York: Schirmer Trade. p. 216-219. Jones left Memphis, Tennessee, where Stax was headquartered, and moved to California while guitarist Steve Cropper, also dissatisfied with the new Stax atmosphere, opened his own studio in Memphis, spending less and less time at the Stax studio. Melting Pot was recorded in New York City, between M.G.'s gigs, as Jones refused to record in Memphis and wanted the band to create a different sound for the new album. The album's title track was edited for length and issued by Stax as a single in spring 1971. \\"Melting Pot\\" peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and at number 21 on the Billboard R&B; singles chart. Critical reception The review in Rolling Stone magazine was very positive, concluding in its final paragraph: \\"Altogether, as an album, it works really well, with the group's customary taste and precision balanced against a new looseness and a return to earlier, funky playing patterns. That's more than enough to make it the best Booker T. album in some time, the Memphis Gas of the Year, and a Major Rock Event for everyone.\\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/melting-pot-19710318 Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Here the Memphis motorvators surpass the somewhat boxy rhythms that have limited all their albums as albums except for Uptight, which had vocals. Al Jackson's solidity, a linchpin of rock drumming as surely as Keith Moon's blastoffs and Charlie Watts's steady economy, is unshaken by the shifts the arrangements demand, and his deftness permits a more flexible concept in which Booker lays back some on organ and Steve Cropper gets more melodic input. A Vegas-jazz ('L.A. Jazz Song' is a title) boop-de-doo chorus upsets the balance of side two pretty badly, but for the first twenty minutes this is unbelievably smooth without ever turning slick.\\" Track listing All songs written by Booker T.

Gradings are typically held in 3 month cycles at regional training centres. Grading systems will typically consist of line work, patterns, theory, and sparring. Students can typically advance through the belts at a rate of 1 Kup every 3 months. Although it is possible for students who perform exceptionally well during their grading to 'double promote', this means that they gain 2 Kup instead of one. this is however not very common and is only done if the student has exhibited complete understanding of the material they are being tested on as well as control and maturity. A double promotion is not possible for a student of red belt (2nd Kup) because their instructor is not permitted to grade them for their black belt. Belts ETU uses the following system of Belt Gradings: * 10th Kup - White belt (white signifies innocence, as a student with no previous knowledge of Taekwondo) * 9th Kup - White belt with yellow tag * 8th Kup - Yellow belt (yellow signifies earth, from which the metaphorical plant sprouts forth and takes root as the foundations of Taekwondo are laid) * 7th Kup - Yellow belt with green tag * 6th Kup - Green belt (green signifies the plant's growth as skills are developed) * 5th Kup - Green belt with blue tag * 4th Kup - Blue belt (blue signifies heaven, towards which the plant is growing as training progresses) * 3rd Kup - Blue belt with red tag * 2nd Kup - Red belt (red signifies danger, cautioning the student to exercise control and warning opponents) * 1st Kup - Red belt with black tag * 1st Dan - Black belt (black is opposite to white and signifies maturity and proficiency in taekwondo) References External links * Category:National members of World Taekwondo Taekwondo ","title":"European Taekwondo Union"},{"id":"12407269","text":"The Panay forest frog (Platymantis panayensis) is a species of frog in the family Ceratobatrachidae.

It is endemic to the Papua New Guinean part of the Solomon Islands archipelago and is only known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka. The specific name parkeri honors Fred Parker, Australian naturalist and explorer who collected the type series. Common name Parker's wrinkled ground frog has been proposed for this species. Distribution and subspecies Two subspecies have been distinguished, each restricted to one island: * Cornufer parkeri parkeri Brown, 1965 – northernmost Bougainville Island * Cornufer parkeri bukanensis Brown, 1965 – Buka Island On Bougainville Island, Cornufer parkeri is restricted to the northernmost part of the island because of the availability of uplifted coral landscapes it inhabits. Description Cornufer parkeri is a small frog: adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is slender. The eyes are large. The snout is pointed- rounded. The tympanum is large and distinct. The finger tips are blunt or slightly pointed, whereas the toes are rather pointed and slightly dilated. No webbing is present. In Cornufer parkeri parkeri, skin is rough and tuberculate. Preserved specimens vary from grayish brown to brown to brownish black. Specimens of lighter colors have irregular darker blotches. A tan, silvery, or whitish middorsal band is present in some individuals. Cornufer parkeri bukanensis has much less warty skin, relatively larger eyes, and relatively broader head than the nominotypical subspecies. Coloration is uniformly purplish brown or with lighter blotches. Habitat and conservation Cornufer parkeri occurs in uplifted coral landscapes at elevations below . It is a terrestrial frog that can be found in lowland rainforest, regrowth forest, rural gardens, villages, and other anthropogenic habitats. Development is, presumably, direct (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). Cornufer parkeri is an adaptable species, but its range is very small, making it vulnerable to chance events.

Bluey Wilkinson. was an international speedway rider. Wilkinson was Speedway World Champion in 1938 after narrowly missing out on winning the inaugural Championship in 1936. Early life Wilkinson was nicknamed \\"Bluey\\" because of his red hair (an Australian custom). At the age of four, Bluey's family moved to Bathurst, New South Wales which he really considered to be his home town. He was working as a butcher boy when speedway first started at the Bathurst Sports Ground in 1928. It was love at first sight for Wilkinson and he promptly gave up a promising rugby league career and invested his savings in a battered old belt driven Rudge.http://www.speedway.net.au/release.asp?NewsId=28243 Career On the Rudge, Bluey Wilkinson wasn't a world-beater, but when Sydney and international star rider Lionel Van Praag came to Bathurst he loaned Wilkinson one of his spare bikes. In a battle of future World Champions, Wilkinson defeated Van Praag in a match race and his talent was recognised. He upgraded his machinery and the results came with it. In 1929 he headed for England in an effort to get noticed by rich Speedway clubs. He rode in the lower divisions for three seasons before he was offered a contract by the West Ham Hammers and stayed with the London based club until 1939.Belton, Brian (2003). Hammerin' Round. He went on to finish third in the Star Riders' Championship in 1933. The Riders' Championship was the forerunner to the Speedway World Championship which was first held in 1936. Wilkinson continued to return home to Australia to race in the Australian season, usually October through April. 1935 saw Bluey win the Australian Championship at the Sydney Showground. He would win the title again in 1938 at the 509m long Showground, winning both the three lap and four lap titles and on both occasions defeating Wilbur Lamoreaux of the United States. At the inaugural Speedway World Championship Final at London's Empire (Wembley) Stadium in 1936, Wilkinson was undefeated to score a 15-point maximum. However, as the championship also counted bonus points from the Semi-finals, Bluey finished with a total of 25 points, one behind fellow Aussie Lionel Van Praag and Englishman Eric Langton. Van Praag won a runoff from Langton with Wilkinson credited as finishing the Final in third place. In 1937 Wilkinson won the National League with the Hammers and in 1938 he won the ACU Cup with the Hammers. However the pinnacle of his career was becoming World Champion in 1938 at Wembley Stadium after finishing third in the inaugural Championship in 1936. He was unlucky not to win the crown in 1936 as he was unbeaten in five races in the final held at Wembley, but was relegated to third place behind winner Lionel Van Praag and England's Eric Langton under a 'bonus points' system which operated during qualifying rounds.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Wilkinson's 1938 championship win was considered a gutsy effort after he had actually broken his left collarbone in a meeting for West Ham the night before the World Final. Determined not to miss the final, Bluey had the Tottenham Hotspur club doctor put his arm and shoulder in plaster. He ignored the pain he was in to win his first four rides before finishing a safe second in his fifth and last to clinch the World Championship before a crowd of 95,000. Bluey Wilkinson retired from riding in 1939 to become the promoter at the Sheffield Speedway. During his career, Wilkinson also rode for Australia in test matches against England and the United States. He scored a maximum 18 points in each of the five Tests against England staged in Australia in the 1937/38 season, a feat he failed to duplicate the following season by only a single point. Wilkinson was inducted into the Australian Speedway Hall of Fame in 2008. World Final Appearances * 1936 - London, Wembley Stadium - 3rd - 25pts * 1938 - London, Wembley Stadium - Winner - 22pts Death After being involved in dozens of spectacular crashes during his speedway career and walking away from them all, Bluey was killed in a road accident in the Sydney suburb of Bondi on 27 July 1940. Riding a motorcycle with his wife Muriel as pillion he was struck by a lorry which had swerved to avoid a car. He was killed almost instantly with a fractured skull. Muriel survived the accident physically with only little more than a few cuts and bruises.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1981 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Another historic marker erected November 13, 1964, also notes that the site was previously occupied by Fort Lernoult until July 11, 1796, when, in compliance with the terms of the Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, British troops had evacuated their last post in United States territory. History State Savings Bank Building c. 1920 The State Savings Bank was organized in 1883, and purchased the site at the corner of Fort and Shelby in 1898, by which time it was the largest bank in Detroit. They commissioned the prominent architect Stanford White to design the Neo-Classical bank. P. 18. The interior and exterior walls are white marble. The main entrance is in a recessed portico and framed by two Ionic columns tall and weighing . Above the entry is a cartouche bearing the Michigan Coat of Arms flanked by two figures representing Industry and Commerce. In 1907, the State Savings Bank merged with the People's Savings Bank to form the People's State Bank, requiring a larger building. The original structure faced Fort Street, but extended only in depth. In 1914, the bank hired Donaldson and Meier to design an addition to the building. The resulting structure doubled the original size by extending the building to Congress Street. P. 88. The addition is nearly indistinguishable from the original. The two-story main banking room in the interior is surrounded by arched colonnades. The colonnades are divided by Ionic pilasters. The second floor occupies the upper portions of the arches and frosted glass allows light to pass between the spaces. The coffered ceiling is molded plaster and is slightly more ornate in the 1898 portion of the building. The main vault stood at the rear of the original structure and the 1914 addition placed it in the middle of the banking floor. In the archway over the Congress Street entry is a mural by American artist Thomas Wilmer Dewing. It is an allegorical representation of the City of Detroit flanked by Commerce and Agriculture. The painting was completed in 1900 and placed in its present position after the structure was expanded in 1914. The bank again merged in 1927 to become the Peoples Wayne County Bank, but disappeared in the financial failures of the Great Depression. Afterward, the headquarters of Edsel Ford's Manufacturer's National Bank occupied the building. In the 1960s, a pedestrian bridge was constructed across Shelby Street to connect the two buildings then occupied by Manufacturer's Bank. The building was continuously used as a bank until the 1980s, when it became an office supply showroom. In August 2013, the building was jeopardized as owners proposed demolition and converting the property to a surface parking lot. Bedrock Real Estate Services, a company owned by local businessman Dan Gilbert added the structure to its portfolio of 65 Detroit properties December 13, 2014. The company did not disclose the purchase price or possible plans, however one rumored use could be an auto museum. The current name is taken from the nearby Savoyard Creek, named by early settlers who arrived in the area from Savoy. The creek began at the current site of Lafayette Park flowed parallel to Congress Street to the foot of Fourth Street where it emptied into the Detroit River. Over time, the creek became an open sewer until complaints from nearby residents caused the city to enclose and incorporate it into the sewer system in 1836. Julian Scott Department Store was located at 151 West Fort Street in downtown Detroit, Michigan.

Design and development The D.332 was an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane. The pilot and co-pilot were seated side by side in a cabin located forward of the wing leading edge. A radio operator station was located behind the pilots, and it had a passenger cabin for eight passengers. The landing gear had trouser-type fairings on the main gear legs. Operations The aircraft first flew on 11 July 1933 powered by three Hispano-Suiza 9V radial engines. The prototype was named Émeraude (\\"Emerald\\" in French) and carried out demonstration flights around European capitals. Émeraude gained a world class record on 7 September 1933 when it flew a 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) course with a useful load of 2,000 kilograms (4,410 pounds) at an average speed of 159.56 km/h (99.1 mph).

Built in alt= Designed to meet an Air France requirement for use on the route to French Indochina, the aircraft set out for Saigon on 21 December 1933 on a proving flight. The aircraft arrived at Saigon on 28 December 1933. On the return flight when only 400 km (250 mi) from its destination, Le Bourget airport, Émeraude struck a hill near Corbigny in a violent snowstorm and was destroyed. Despite the accident, Air France decided to order three of an improved version designated the D.333. The D.333 was a heavier and strengthened ten-seat version, the fully loaded weight being increased by 1,650 kg (3,640 lb). The three D.333s were used on the Toulouse- Dakar sector of the Air France South American route for several years. Two of these aircraft were transferred to the Argentine Air Force after World War II and used, along with two 338s.

Cards valid for either one or three years can be purchased at a cost of £30 for one year or £70 for three.http://www.familyandfriends-railcard.co.uk/eligibility- benefits/what-do-you-get/ It is one of the discounted and concessionary fare schemes available on Britain's railway network to people who either belong to particular groups or who are willing to buy tickets ahead of the date of travel. Before 18 May 2008 it was known as the Family Railcard, but the name was changed to reflect the fact that discounted travel is not restricted to adults and children who are related. History Following the introduction of the Young Persons Railcard and Senior Railcard earlier in the 1970s, and the implementation throughout that decade of a wide range of short-term promotional fares and other offers for children travelling with adults, British Rail announced at the beginning of 1979 that they intended to introduce a new Railcard to give permanent discounts for adult-and-child groups. The original plan was for a £4.00 \\"one-adult\\" card—this would give no discount for the Railcard holder, but up to four accompanying children would be able to travel for £0.50 each on various off-peak tickets—and a £9.00 \\"two- adult\\" card, on which a second adult could be named; they would also pay £0.50 when travelling with the first named adult. In both cases, the Railcard holder would need a British Rail \\"Photocard\\" (numbered photographic identity card). The intended launch date was 1 May 1979.Boddy, Brian (2001): It's on the cards: that some things have got worse (The Transport Ticket Society 2000 Presidential Address), page 13. The Transport Ticket Society, Kemsing. When the scheme was introduced on an experimental basis on 17 June 1979, there was only one change from the proposals: the prices of the single-holder and joint- holder Railcards were set at £5.00 and £10.00 respectively. As from 1 March 1980, the Railcard became a permanent scheme. Also at this point, the prices rose to £8.00 and £16.00 respectively, and on the joint-holder card, the minimum age for the second named holder was lowered from 18 to 14 (before being raised to 16, British Rail's standard transition age from child to adult status, on 29 November 1981).Boddy, page 13. At this stage, Railcards were issued with an expiry date, rather than being valid from their date of issue for a specific length of time. In connection with this, for a period during late 1980, both cards were reduced in price to £5.00, as they were only valid until 28 February 1981. A series of major changes were made on 1 February 1981. The new version of the Railcard became valid for either one or two adults, with no distinction in price—so the separate \\"joint-holder Railcard\\" ceased to exist. The price was changed to £10.00; the Railcard holder now gained a discount of 50% on off-peak fares; the child flat fare became £1.00; and two other adults (in addition to the holder/s) could travel in the group for half fare. Other than a price rise in 1983, and some discounts on Motorail services, Sealink ferry services to the Channel Islands and rail-based holidays, the conditions remained the same until 1985.Boddy, pages 13-14. The discount structure was changed on 12 May 1985, with Standard Day and Cheap Day Returns still receiving 50% off, but Standard Singles, Standard Returns (the equivalent of present-day Open tickets) and Saver tickets of all descriptions receiving a reduced discount of 34%. Child tickets of all types were still available at the £1.00 flat fare, however. Sealink discounts had been formalised and improved by this stage, with 50% discounts on Day Returns (34% discounts on other fares) to both the Channel Islands and the Isle of Wight; however, by the end of 1985, these had been altered again, with less substantial discounts being offered.Boddy, page 14. Discounts were further reduced in the next revision from 15 May 1990, with the Railcard being redesigned at the same time: the colour scheme was generally blue, with a pictorial background. Saver tickets, and the recently introduced Supersaver fares (lower-rate Savers), were now discounted by 25%; all other tickets received 34% off, including One Day Travelcards (with a minimum fare restriction). This was soon restricted to \\"All Zone\\" (1-6) Travelcards only. The Saver and Supersaver discount was cut again, to 20%, from 29 May 1994, at which point the child flat fare—which had been fixed at £1.00 since 1981—was raised to £2.00. Another redesign of the ticket stock happened at this point, with the predominant colour being brown. Meanwhile, as from 29 May 1995, the Railcard could be bought by anybody aged 16 and above. The previous lower age limit was 18, which was anomalous on two counts: for all other ticket-issuing purposes, people were considered adults from their 16th birthday onwards; and the lower limit for the second named holder (where applicable) had been 16 since 1981. 2000 change and effect on child fares The most recent change involving the discount structure happened as from 29 May 2000, and involved the introduction of another new ticket stock with a changed logo, red upper band and new form number (RSP 4599/253; all previous APTIS Family Railcards had used BR 4599/19, or RSP 4599/19 after privatisation.)Boddy, page 56. All adult fares received a 34% discount, representing an improvement in respect of Saver and Supersaver fares; but the child discount was amended from a flat fare of £2.00 to a 60% discount on the full child fare (equivalent to an 81% discount on the full adult fare). This was subject to a £1.00 minimum fare. These conditions and discounts remain in place as of 2007. The effect on child fares has been to make shorter (and lower-priced) journeys cheaper, but longer journeys more expensive. The \\"pivot point\\", where the child fare with the new version of the Railcard is the same as it was under \\"flat fare\\" conditions, occurs where the adult fare for a journey is £10.50, as shown in these examples: {  - !Adult fare... !...81% discount... !...Child fare - align=\\"center\\" £3.00 align=\\"center\\" Min. fare applies align=\\"center\\" £1.00 - align=\\"center\\" £6.00 align=\\"center\\" × 0.19 = align=\\"center\\" £1.15 - align=\\"center\\" £10.00 align=\\"center\\" × 0.19 = align=\\"center\\" £1.90 - bgcolor=#FFA07A align=\\"center\\" £10.50 bgcolor=#FFA07A align=\\"center\\" × 0.19 = bgcolor=#FFA07A align=\\"center\\" £2.00 - align=\\"center\\" £20.00 align=\\"center\\" × 0.19 = align=\\"center\\" £3.80 - align=\\"center\\" £30.00 align=\\"center\\" × 0.19 = align=\\"center\\" £5.70 - } 2008 changes On 18 May 2008, the first stage of a two-part change to simplify Britain's rail fare structure was implemented. At the same time, the names of two Railcards were changed: the Young Persons Railcard became the 16-25 Railcard, and the Family Railcard was rebranded Family and Friends Railcard. This reflects the fact that non-family members may use the card and obtain discounts. Travelling conditions were also relaxed from this date: up four adults and four children can now travel together regardless of whether there is only one, or two, named cardholders present. Tickets issued with a Railcard An adult railway ticket bought with a Family & Friends Railcard. Note the FAM code in the top left On the APTIS, PORTIS/SPORTIS and other computerised ticket issuing systems, a \\"status code\\" field is provided on each ticket issued. This is left blank if an adult is travelling at full (undiscounted) fare; but if any discount or other special condition applies, a code of up to five letters appears. Since the introduction of the APTIS and PORTIS systems in 1986, an adult ticket bought with a Family Railcard has always been identified with the code FAM. This has continued since the introduction of various \\"New Generation\\" systems that have superseded these. The code used for child tickets has varied, however. Usually, CHFAM is used; but during some of the changeover periods between different versions of the Railcard, FAMCH has been used as well. In these circumstances, one code has been used for tickets issued against the \\"original\\" Railcard, and the other has been used for those issued with the \\"new\\" version. CHFAM was used exclusively again once all of the \\"original\\" Railcards had expired. This happened after both the 1990 and the 2000 changes to the Railcard conditions.Journal of the Transport Ticket Society, number 438 (July 2000): page 265. ISSN 0144-347X Definition of child fares For ticket-issuing purposes, British Rail defined a child as being between five years old and one day short of 16 years old.British Rail Business Systems and Services (1991): Ticket Examiners' Handbook Number 6 — May 1991, Section B, Page B5. This definition has been maintained since privatisation. Children under five are allowed free travel, provided that they do not occupy reserved seats and that no more than two (in British Rail days, four) accompany each fare-paying adult. The sole exception to this occurs with the Family Railcard: if a Railcard holder is travelling with one or more children under the age of five, and the combination of Railcard-discounted adult fare plus Railcard-discounted child fare(s) is cheaper than the full (non-discounted) adult fare, the Railcard holder may buy discounted tickets for the group, as if the children were actually five or older. Where children turn 16 during the validity of a Railcard, they may still travel at the child fare until it expires. Applications Railcards can be bought at railway station ticket offices; Rail Appointed Travel Agencies; by post from an agency at Harrington Dock, Liverpool (this option was available by 1993, and possibly earlier; the agency was originally set up in 1989 for Senior Railcards); through train operating company telesales facilities; and online at a website accessed via ATOC's \\"Railcards\\" website. Railcards bought online are sent by post. Price The price of the Railcard has increased over time: {  - !Effective from !Single-holder railcard !Joint-holder railcard - align=\\"center\\" 17 June 1979 align=\\"center\\" £5.00 align=\\"center\\" £10.00 - align=\\"center\\" 1 March 1980 align=\\"center\\" £8.00 align=\\"center\\" £16.00 - align=\\"center\\" 1 February 1981 align=\\"center\\" £10.00 align=\\"center\\" £10.00 - align=\\"center\\" 19 June 1983 align=\\"center\\" £12.00 align=\\"center\\" £12.00 - align=\\"center\\" 12 January 1986 align=\\"center\\" £15.00 align=\\"center\\" £15.00 - align=\\"center\\" May 1989 align=\\"center\\" £20.00 align=\\"center\\" £20.00 - align=\\"center\\" Early 2008 align=\\"center\\" £24.00 align=\\"center\\" £24.00 - align=\\"center\\" 17 May 2009 align=\\"center\\" £26.00 align=\\"center\\" £26.00 - } As from 1 February 1981, dedicated joint-holder railcards were withdrawn; and either one or two names could be shown on a railcard, with no price difference.Boddy, page 54. Popularity In 2000, approximately 300,000 Railcards were in use. 2.9 million journeys using the Railcard were made per year at that stage. Notes : Form numbers are codes introduced by British Rail to classify and catalogue all printed material: documents, tickets, wage slips, notepaper, parcels labels and hundreds of other items. Form numbers consist of a primary code and, often, a sub-code, separated by /. APTIS tickets used primary code 4599 in British Rail days; this changed to 7599 on post-privatisation \\"RSP\\" tickets. Other primary codes have since been introduced on Rail Settlement Plan ticket stock for New Generation (post- APTIS) ticket issuing systems.

It is endemic to the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New Guinea, and is known from the islands of New Britain, New Ireland, and Manus; the Manus population might represent a distinct species. Etymology Cornufer schmidti is named after Karl Patterson Schmidt, American herpetologist. Common name Schmidt's wrinkled ground frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded to broadly round-pointed. The tympanum is distinct and moderately large. The fingers tips are dilated into moderate, depressed discs. The toes are slightly webbed and have smaller discs than the fingers. Dorsal folds are moderate to short, usually scattered over the entire dorsum. Habitat and conservation Cornufer schmidti occurs in lowland rainforests, disturbed forests, plantations, and gardens, often in association with coconut husk piles. Development is direct (i.e, there is no free-living larval stage). It is an abundant and adaptable species that seems not to be threatened. It is probably present in a number of protected areas.

It is endemic to Fiji. Presumed to be originally a forest species, it is nowadays also found in a range of man-made habitats, including degraded forest, rural gardens, plantations, and even close to the beach. The Fiji ground frog is found on four larger islands (Taveuni, Vanua Levu, Ovalau, and Gau) and a small island, Viwa, (0.6 ha) off the eastern coast of the main island (Viti Levu) of the Fiji archipelago. The species maintains populations throughout the forested (primary, secondary and coastal/littoral) parts of these islands (Osborne, unpublished data). A largish frog, it can grow up to 100 g and to body lengths (SUL) of 110 mm. The larger individuals tend to be a very dull dark brown (sometimes with yellow spots on either side of the head near the tympanum). However, smaller adults and juvenile frogs can be highly polymorphic in coloration, with banding and stippling in darker or lighter hues of red, brown, green and curry-yellow. It is distinguished from the Cornufer vitiensis by its larger size and smaller toe pads. The Fiji ground is a nocturnal ground dweller, however, individuals have been encountered on low branches and leaves of riparian forest vegetation. It is thought to be a sit and wait predator, waiting for nocturnal insects to venture nearby. Reproduction The breeding cycle of these frogs is affected by extrinsic environmental conditions and intrinsic reproductive hormonal mechanisms. During the active breeding phase mature gravid females clearly show the presence of large creamy eggs. Nesting occurs terrestrially, mostly underneath rotting logs, and crevices within coconut tree bark and within bamboo. This species lays around 50-60 eggs inside prepared nests and covered with leaf litter. Embryonic development takes place over 29–30 days and froglets hatch directly from eggs forgoing the tadpole stage. The age at maturity of C. vitianus is still not known.

Southern Canaan (in modern terms Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan) was inhabited by a number of Semitic states speaking Canaanite languages, these being Israel, Judah, Samarra, Ammon, Edom, Moab, the Suteans and Amalekites. In addition, the Philistines migrated into this region from the Aegean, a non-Semitic Indo- European speaking people. Northern Canaan (in modern terms Lebanon the Mediterranean coast of Syria and far south west coast of Turkey) was also inhabited by Canaanite speaking peoples, coalesced into city states such as Tyre, Sidon, Berytus, Arvad, Simyra, Onoba and Tarshish. The term Phoenicia was applied to this region, but it is a later Greek application which was not used during the Assyrian period. To the east, in modern terms the interior of modern Syria (the Assyrian north east excluded), the region had since the 24th century BC been inhabited by the Canaanite speaking Amorites and for a time the East Semitic speaking Eblaites also, thus much of this region had been known as the Land of the Amurru. However, from the 12th century BC a new Semitic group appeared, in the form of the Arameans, and by the late 11th century BC this region was known as Aramea/Aram and Eber Nari and remained named as such during the latter part of the Middle Assyrian Empire, Neo Assyrian Empire, Neo-Babylonian Empire and Achaemenid Empire. The term Syria is in actuality originally a 10th-century BC Indo-Anatolian name for Assyria, centuries later applied by the Greeks during the Seleucid Empire (311–150 BC) not only to Assyria itself but much of the Levant (see Etymology of Syria). The approach of the devastating Assyrian armies would more often than not result in the vassalage of these states. Similarly, any long absence would result in rebellion, often sponsored by another of Assyria's numerous opponents. The result is that numerous Kings of Assyria launched campaigns to bring these economically important regions under Assyrian rule. The rebellion after one King's offensive would result in his successor's next vengeful assault. When Tyre ceased to pay tribute to the Assyrian kings, rebellion broke out. Background Prior to the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the late 10th century BC, much of the land known today as Syria and Lebanon was ruled by various independent Canaanite speaking city states. Trade established between these cities and those of the Mediterranean gave some of these cities great wealth. During the Middle Assyrian Empire, after gaining ascendancy over much of the ancient Near East and Asia Minor at the expense of the Hittite Empire, Hurri-Mitanni, Egyptian Empire, Babylonia and Phrygia, the Assyrians turned their attention to the East Mediterranean coast. Tiglath-Pileser I (1115–1077 BC) invaded the region and conquered the Canaanite-Phoenician states of Byblos, Tyre, Sidon, Simyra, Berytus (Beirut), Aradus and finally Arvad.The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968 However, Assyria went into a period of 'comparative decline from 1055 BC onwards, its territories shrinking dramatically, and although one Assyrian king is recorded as having campaigned in the region in the late 10th century BC, Phoenicia was essentially lost to Assyria. King Adad-nirari II (911–891 BC) ascended to the throne and immediately began consolidating the domains of Assyria and punishing rebellious vassals, giving rise to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. After the death of Adad-nirari II, Tukulti-Ninurta II (890–884 BC) began expanding against Assyria's enemies to the north and east in Asia Minor and Ancient Iran. The expansion into the north meant that the next Assyrian King, Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) was in a position to greatly expand Assyria's political and military influence out of Mesopotamia. After crushing the revolt of the city of Suru, invading the Levant and defeating the Aramaean King of Bit Adini and mercilessly mutilating other rebels along the Upper Tigris river, Ashurnasirpal II turned his attention to the West, to the land of the Phoenicians.  Campaigns of Ashurnasirpal II, 883–859 B.C   War  Ashurnasirpal II's brutal treatment of rebels ensured that the absence of his army would not incite more revolts. Taking his army, which was typically composed of infantry (including auxiliaries and foreigners), heavy & light cavalry and chariots, Ashurnasirpal conquered the Neo-Hittites and Aramaean states of northern Syria. Resistance was almost certainly encountered but many of the smaller cities immediately surrendered, often by rushing in advance of their settlement's location and offering tribute. Such tribute would naturally come with acts of humiliation, as Ashurnasirpal II proudly documents: > The tribute of the sea coast – from the inhabitants of Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, > Mahallata, Kaiza, Amurru and Arvad which is an Island in the sea, consisting > of gold, silver, tin, copper, copper-containers, linen garments with multi- > coloured trimmings, large and small monkeys, ebony, boxwood, ivory from > walrus tusk, a product of the sea – this their tribute I received and they > embraced my feet. In the previous text Ashurnasirpal II mentions conquering an Island, Cyprus demonstrating that Assyrian armies were not defeated by large bodies of water. Consequence  Ashurnasirpal II did not annex the Phoenician cities but instead only aimed to assert his domination and establish them as a source of raw materials for the Assyrian war machine. Iron was needed for weapons, Lebanese cedar for construction, gold and silver for the payment of troops; in the end however, Ashunasirpal's campaigns were only a short term.  Campaigns of Shalmaneser III, 858–824 BC  Shalmaneser was the son of Ashurnasirpal II and like his father, expended much of his energies into fighting and expanding in the name of Ashur. However, while he did campaign for 31 years of his 35 years on the throne, his death was met with unrealized dreams and ultimately civil conflict and another short period of instability within the empire. The cities of Aramea and Canaan once more began to rebel and in 853 BC. Shalmaneser III led an army to cross the Euphrates and into northern Aram. After taking Aleppo, he encountered on the plains of central Syria a coalition of Aramean and Canaanite states, including forces sent by King Ahab of Israel. The outcome of the battle was most likely a stalemate for Shalmaneser III – although some vassal states were brought back into line, and later he campaigned on three more occasions against his opponents in 849, 845 and 838 BC, conquering much of the Levant. He failed to take Damascus but devastated much of its territory however many of the Phoenician cities received a respite from Assyrian attacks during the reign of Shamshi-Adad V and the regent queen Semiramis.Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq Adad-nirari III proved a vigorous king. Among his actions was a siege of Damascus in the time of Ben- Hadad III in 796 BC, which led to the eclipse of the Aramaean Kingdom of Damascus and allowed the recovery of Israel under Jehoash (who paid the Assyrian king tribute at this time) and Jeroboam II.Ancient Near Eastern History and Culture by William H. Stiebing Jr.  Campaigns of Tiglath Pileser III, 745–727 BC  Tiglath Pileser III brought the Assyrian empire out of the period of instability it had entered after the death of Adad-nirari III in 783 BC, much to the fear of Assyria's enemies. His reforms in administration and in the military included the introduction of a standing army (allowing for extensive campaigning and siege warfare), greater lines of communication and supply of horses, metal, arrows and other necessities of war. Upon conquering a new territory, an Assyrian official would be put in charge to supervise and ensure Assyrian interests and tribute were maintained. With these and with his energetic campaigning, the Levant and many of the Phoenician cities were doomed to lose their independence once again to the brutal yet effective Assyrian armies. After taking care of the troublesome Chaldean and Sutean tribes who had migrated into Babylonia to the south, and re-affirming Babylon's vassalage to Assyria, Tiglath led a campaign against the northern opponents of Urartu – Urartu had been extending their influence into the eastern Mediterranean by carving out a number of vassal state along the fertile crescent and into southern Canaan. Consequently, Tiglath's moves against Aramea and Canaan served to aid him in his war against Urartu. Upon hearing of the advancing armies of Assyria, the vassal states in northern Syria called for the forces of Urartu to protect them. In a crushing defeat in the Upper Euphrates Tiglath ensured that no troops would come to their aid; an unsuccessful siege of the capital of Urartu, Turushpa meant that Tiglath concentrated his efforts in the West. The Syrian city of Arpad was placed under siege in 747 BC. While most armies of the time would not be able to lay siege for more than half a year (the seasonal change demanded the soldiers return to their farms and tend to their fields and livestock) the reforms of Tilgath mean that his standing army would take the city in the third year of the siege. In 738 BC, Tiglath mirrored the moves of his predecessor, Ashurnasirpal II by accepting the tribute of many of cities in Canaan and Syria. The fruits of the conquests ensured once again a good supply of raw materials to feed the Assyrian war machine. When Tiglath placed a trade embargo on exporting Phoenician cedar to Egypt, Egyptian-backed rebellions broke out throughout the region, all crushed and all made to recognize the suzerainty of nation of Assur.  Shalmaneser V, 726–722 BC and Sargon II, 721–705 BC  Sargonid dynasty Sargon II (right), king of Assyria (r. 722 – 705 BC), with the crowned prince, Sennacherib (left) The succession of Sargon II to Tiglath is surrounded by mystery – his campaigns against Babylon mention a previous conquest of Jerusalem, the capital of the Israelites of southern Canaan and the mass deportation of some 27,000+ inhabitants to the lands of Media. The most likely result is that another King before Sargon II, Shalmaneser V may have launched campaigns in the provinces of Syria and Palestine before being overthrown by Sargon II – whose rebellion would have encouraged others throughout the Empire, including the secession of Babylon from Assyria vassalage. Sargon II therefore claims the glory of his usurped predecessor's conquest of Israel. In any case, the Assyrians under Sargon II were once more forced to campaign in the immediate vicinity of Assyria, resulting in an outbreak of rebellion in Syria (no doubt in order to take advantage of the pre-occupied status of the Assyrian army). After defeating her opponents, Sargon II decided to head west rather than completely defeat Elam, being content with reducing her ability to campaign for some time. The Syrian rebellion was backed by the Egyptians (Hanuna of Gaza was encouraged by them and so rebelled) and led by the ruler of Hamath. The cities of Damascus, Samaria and a few other Phoenician cities also broke away and allied once again to face the threat of Assyria. The rebellion was ultimately doomed; the coalition lacked the military ability to stop Sargon's rapid advance south. After taking Arpad, Sargon II smashed the coalition army at Qarqar, thereby avenging the stalemate of Shalmaneser III. Hamath, followed by Damascus and then Samaria fell. Sargon then went on to take Gaza where he brushed aside an Egyptian expeditionary force. Hanuna was captured and flayed Another attempt by the Egyptians in 712 BC to foment a rebellion failed when Ashdod, the prime mover of this rebellion was defeated by Sargon's pre-emptive action. Thereafter Palestine and much of the Phoenician cities were secure. Sargon's military expeditions against Urartu and Phrygia allowed him to exert greater influence in northern Syria and Phoenicia.  Sennacherib, 704–681 BC  It is unknown how rebellious the cities of Tyre and other Phoenician cities were under the reign of Sennacherib. It is however known that in 701 BC, Sennacherib marched south down the Mediterranean coast to suppress the rebellions by their vassals, the Philistine, backed by the kingdom of Judah. After defeating yet another Egyptian expeditionary force, the Philistine cities surrendered and tribute once again offered, with records speaking of bringing many hostile \\"cities\\" (some of which were much more like villages) \\"to embrace his [Sennacherib] feet\\". This may well have included a number of Phoenician cities in Lebanon. Nonetheless, the vassals in the region would not stop rebelling while Babylon, Elam or Urartu too rebelled against Assyria, and not while Egypt continued to provide aid to the rebels.  Esarhaddon 680–669 BC  Esarhaddon's reconstruction of Babylon and his vassal treaty imposed upon the Persians and Medes allowed him to turn his attention to the rebellious city of Tyre (which had rebelled with Egyptian aid). In 671 BC, Esarhaddon went to war against Pharaoh Taharqa of Egypt, the head of a foreign Nubian dynasty. Part of his army stayed behind to deal with rebellions in Tyre, and perhaps Ashkelon. The remainder went south to Rapihu, then crossed the Sinai, a desert inhabited by dreadful and dangerous animals, and entered Egypt. In the summer, he took Memphis, and Taharqa fled back to Nubia . Esarhaddon now called himself \\"king of Egypt, Libya, and Kush\\", and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a victory stele at this time, showing the son of Taharqa in bondage, Prince Ushankhuru.  Ashurbanipal 668–627 BC  Ashurbanipal, a palace relief from Nineveh. Ashurbanipal would be the last Assyrian King to have the ability to campaign in Phoenicia and much of Aram. Marching his army into Egypt (in order to safeguard Syria) he defeated the rebellious opponents there and installed puppet princes on the throne. Egyptian attempts at taking Memphis ended miserably with Ashurbanipal marching south into Upper Egypt and taking Thebes \\"like a floodstorm\\". His campaigning against Egypt coincided with another attempt to stop Tyre and Arvad from rebelling without being punished for it afterwards. With the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC, Aramea and Phoenicia gradually fell from Assyrian rule as Assyria was engulfed in bitter civil war which would see its downfall by 605 BC. Ironically, it would be the Assyrians former vassals, the Egyptians, who would attempt to aid the Assyrians as they moved the capital of their collapsing kingdom to Harran. The destruction of the Assyrian Empire meant that Babylon and then Persia would rule Phoenicia, Canaan and Aramea until Alexander the Great of Macedon would initiate the Hellenistic Age.

It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its development has been halted. There are two main mechanisms of action for seletracetam. The first is its high-affinity stereospecific binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). Seletracetam has shown potent seizure suppression in models of acquired and genetic epilepsy, and has been well tolerated by various animal models. The second is its binding to N-type calcium channels and preventing influx of Ca2+ during high-voltage activation that is typical of epilepsy. While similar in structure to nootropic drugs, it is not expected to have cognitive enhancing properties. Seletracetam was in Phase II clinical trials under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but its production is on hold. Synthesis Seletracetam's molecular structure contains elements common to other anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam and brivaracetam, such as a nitrogen heterocyclic system. Like brivaracetam, seletracetam is a derivative of levetiracetam. Structure and activity relationship studies have concluded that the most potent anticonvulsant activity was at the imide nitrogen atom and that this activity was further enhanced by nearby electronegative functional groups such as the di-fluoro group on seletracetam. Administration Seletracetam is an orally administered drug, after which it is quickly and efficiently absorbed. The typical dosage is 0.03–10 mg/kg per day (up to 0.6g per day). Mechanism of action Seletracetam's anti-epileptic effects are due to its high affinity binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A)—part of a calcium ion regulator. The SV2A protein assists with the coordination of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which induces neurotransmitter release in the presence of an influx in Ca2+. A correlation has been drawn between the binding affinity of seletracetam (and its analogues) to SV2A and the degree of seizure prevention in animal models. In addition, studies of ion currents have shown that seletracetam significantly decreases the amount of high-voltage derived Ca2+ currents which have been implicated in causing the high intracellular Ca2+ influx during epileptic activity. It is thought that seletracetam binds to N-type Ca2+ channels and inhibits their ability to allow calcium ions to enter the cell, although the drug does not bind to T-type channels that mediate low- voltage activated Ca2+ currents. Seletracetam thereby decreases cellular excitation, but it does not seem to affect voltage-gated Na+ or K+ currents. Selectracetam has been demonstrated to not significantly affect currents gated by NMDA, AMPA, GABA, glycine, or kainic acid. The dual effect of seletracetam is an overall decrease in the amount of Ca2+ influx in the cell during an action potential due to binding at N-type channels, which prevents over- excitation of the neuron, as well as a decrease in neurotransmitter release as a product of cellular excitation due to the interaction of the drug with SV2A, which reduces the spread of excitation to nearby cells. Compared to levetiracetam, which binds at the same site, seletracetam binds to SV2A with ten times higher affinity. The nature of why the seletracetam molecule binds so specifically to SV2A and how SV2A affects exocytosis is unclear. Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics The oral bioavailability of seletracetam is >90% and its half-life is approximately 8 hours. 25% of ingested seletracetam is metabolized and excreted unchanged and about 53% is excreted in the form of an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite. The main metabolic mechanism is the hydrolysis of an acetamide to a carboxylic acid. Seletracetam exhibits first-order mono-compartmental pharmacokinetics, in which there is a simple linear relationship between the amount of drug that was administered, the time that has passed, and the amount of drug subsequently remaining in the body. This contrasts the nonlinear pharmacokinetics typical of previously available anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytolin, valproate and carbamazepine. The benefit of linear kinetics is that the steady-state concentration of the drug is directly and reliably related to the dose of the drug that is administered; this allows for simple and reliable dose adjustments. In vitro studies In vitro studies performed in rodent hippocampal slices found that seletracetam causes a complete reversal of the increases in activity of population spike amplitude in epilepsy models. These reductions in in vitro epilepsy symptoms were present at extracellular concentrations of 3.2 μM. This is approximately 10% of the most effective concentration of levetiracetam in similar tests. Animal studies Seletracetam has been tested on various animal models for epilepsy, with mixed results. Unlike drugs that act on voltage-gated sodium channels, seletracetam was demonstrated to have no significant effect on the maximal electroshock seizure test results in mice. It similarly had no relieving effects in mice of the other most common acute seizure model, the pentylenetetrazol convulsion-induction model. Seletracetam did, however, show promising results in acquired and genetic epilepsy models. In the mouse model of corneal kindling, which exhibits the anticonvulsant capability of generalized motor seizures, doses as low as 0.07 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection (i.p.), and ED50 of 0.31 mg/kg i.p. were effective. Occurrence of audiogenic seizures—those induced by white noise—in mice were also significantly reduced by an ED50 of 0.17 mg/kg i.p., which suggests that selectracetam reduces convulsions caused by clonic seizures. In hippocampal kindling model rats, seizure severity was significantly reduced by seletracetam oral doses of 0.23 mg/kg. This provides further evidence of the potential benefits of selectracetam on generalized motor seizures. Seletracetam also performed well as a method to reduce the suppression of spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges that are often associated with absence epilepsy activity. This was demonstrated by its effect on Strasbourg genetic absence epilepsy rats (GAERS). This model had an ED50 of 0.15 mg/kg i.p. Rodents were found to have negligible behavioral deficits as a result of seletracetam administration, as measured by performance on a rotarod task. Adverse effects and tolerance Unlike currently prescribed anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, valproate, and phenobarbital, seletracetam shows few central nervous system (CNS) side effects and is predicted to have low levels of drug-drug interactions due to its low binding (<10%) to plasma proteins. There have been, however, no formal studies conducted on drug-drug interactions with seletracetam. Other than SV2A and the high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, seletracetam does not significantly bind to other CNS receptors, ion channels, or uptake mechanisms. Seletracetam has, however, shown a slight selectivity for glycine receptors. This drug neither inhibits nor unnecessarily induces the action of any major human metabolizing enzymes, which further reduces adverse effects. Early data from phase I trials were optimistic, and found seletracetam to be well tolerated by human volunteers. In phase II trials side effects were limited to the CNS in origin, were of mild to moderate severity, and most were resolved within 24 hours and with no medical intervention. The most frequently reported adverse effects of seletracetam were dizziness, feeling drunk, euphoria, nausea, and somnolence. Seletracetam was well tolerated by healthy individuals after single oral doses ranging from 2 to 600 mg, as well as after b.i.d. (twice daily) doses of 200 mg. Toxicology studies have shown that this drug has low acute oral toxicity and no significant negative effects on the CNS, cardiac, or respiratory systems. High doses of 2000 mg/kg per day (in mice and rats) and greater than 600 mg/kg per day (in dogs) were poorly tolerated. FDA approval status Phase II clinical trials of seletracetam were ongoing but in July 2007 the company stated that the drug's development has been put on hold. Although the conducted Phase II trials showed success, it was less than expected given the performance of seletracetam in animal models. There have been no known Phase IIb or Phase III trials. In 2010, development of seletracetam was halted in favor of the development of brivaracetam, a newer variation of the drug.

Designed and built by George Parnall & Co. for use on Royal Navy aircraft carriers, it was ordered into small-scale production but after extensive evaluation, the Fairey Flycatcher was preferred for large-scale service. Development and design The Parnall Plover was designed by Harold Bolas, chief designer of the reformed George Parnall & Co. to meet the requirements of the British Air Ministry Specification 6/22 for a single-seat fighter aircraft. The successful aircraft was to replace the Nieuport Nightjar and be powered by a Bristol Jupiter or Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engine capable of being operated from aircraft carriers or as a floatplane. The Plover was a single-bay biplane of wood-and-fabric construction, fitted with full-span flaps and could be fitted with a conventional wheeled undercarriage or floats (with wheels protruding through the bottom of the floats). The first prototype flew in late 1922, powered by a Bristol Jupiter. Two more prototypes followed, with the second a floatplane, also powered by a Jupiter and the third a landplane powered by a Jaguar engine. The three prototypes proved to be similar in performance to the competing Fairey Flycatcher, with small orders being placed for both types, ten for the Plover, to allow more detailed operational evaluation. Operational history Six Plovers entered service with 403 and 404 Fleet Fighter Flights of the Royal Air Force in 1923, allowing the type to be evaluated in service against the Flycatcher and the Nightjar, which both types were planned to replace. The Flycatcher was preferred, being a more popular aircraft to fly as well as being easier to rig, replacing the Plover in 1924. One aircraft was entered on the civil register as G-EBON and was flown in the 1919 King's Cup Air Race, the Plover retired from the race due to fuel flow problems.United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority – Aircraft Register G-EBON G-EBON crashed and was destroyed in January 1929.

Babylonian conquest Prior to the rise of the Babylonian Empire in the late 7th century BC, Phoenicia had been a well-sought after land in the eastern Mediterranean with Hittites and then Assyrians occupying the country in the 13th - 12th centuries and 10th - 7th centuries respectively. Following the collapse of the Assyrian Empire in Mesopotamia in 609 BC, Assyrian forces continued to resist their Babylonian conquerors in Syria until 605 BC, when Babylon finally defeated the Assyrians at Carchemish, ending the last vestige of the Assyrian Empire. The conquest of Assyria by Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, put him at odds with the Egyptian Pharaoh, whose interests lay in keeping a friendly Assyrian state in control of parts of the Levant. Consequently, the Babylonians had to fight the Egyptians in order to take control of Phoenicia and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean coast. However, the Egyptians were unable to contain the Babylonian might, and the Egyptians soon withdrew back to their homeland. The Babylonians moved into the former Assyrian provinces on the eastern Mediterranean coast, and Phoenicia became part of the new Babylonian Empire.Roux, pp. 377, 378  The reign of Nebuchadnezzar (605 - 562 BC)  An engraving of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon, ruled for around 43 years, from 605 BC to 562 BC. Nebuchadnezzar, like many other foreign rulers of Phoenicia before him, exploited Phoenicia's resources to enrich his empire. The economic benefits he gained included harvesting timber, which greatly financed his construction projects throughout Mesopotamia. The Phoenician city-states frequently rebelled against their Babylonian overlords, which resulted in almost yearly campaigns to repress the revolts. In 586 BC, fresh from the destruction of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar and his army laid siege to Tyre, which had revolted. After an incredible 13 years of siege, the city finally capitulated.Roux, pp. 378-380http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-23369/Lebanon see section titled \\"Assyrian and Babylonian domination of Phoenicia\\"  Collapse of Babylon  Nebuchadnezzar's successors did him no credit and much of his gains were lost within a few decades. The rise of the Persians to the east was ignored by Babylon's incompetent rulers. Even before Babylon fell, Persia conquered Syria and seized Phoenicia from Babylonian rule. In the battle of Sardis, a smaller Persian army succeeded (with the aid of camels and spearmen) in defeating an alliance of Lydian princes and Asian Greeks. Since Nabonidus (King of Babylon from 556 BC) had sent troops to aid the Lydians and Greeks, the Persians then marched against Babylon and took the city in 539 BC, and the lands of the Babylonian Empire, including Phoenicia, passed into Persian hands.

The plant is the only coal fired power plant ever constructed by TVA with one unit, and is expected to close in 2023. Location Bull Run Plant is located on , in the Claxton community of Anderson County, Tennessee, on the north bank of Bull Run Creek, directly across the Clinch River (Melton Hill Lake) from Oak Ridge, Tennessee. History Construction began on April 2, 1962 and was completed on June 12, 1967, when the plant began commercial operation. In August 2018, TVA began studying whether to retire Bull Run. On February 14, 2019, the TVA board of directors voted 5-2 to close Bull Run by December 2023, as well as the remaining coal unit at Paradise in Kentucky by December 2020. High operational costs and low capacity were its factors in their decision. Units and operating parameters The plant is the only single-generator coal-fired plant in the TVA system. The plant's winter net generating capacity is about 889 MWe.TVA's website lists the winter generating capacity as 870 MW The plant consumes of coal per day, and requires of cooling water per hour. Its supercritical boiler operates at a pressure of and temperature of . When the generator first went into operation, it was the largest in the world measured in terms of the volume of steam produced. Environmental impact In 2006, the plant ranked the 70th among the large coal-fired plants in the United States on the list of worst SO2 polluters, having emitted of sulfur dioxide per MWh of energy produced (27,987 tons of SO2 in 2006 altogether). Since then, a wet limestone scrubber has been installed, which reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by about 95%. In 2015, the plant released 2,510,476 tons of .

The time span elapsed since the time of transmission (TOT or ToT) is the time of flight (TOF or ToF). Compared to the TDOA technique, TOA techniques uses the absolute time of arrival (possibly biased) at a certain base station rather than the measured time difference between departing from one and arriving at the other station. The distance can be directly calculated from the time of arrival as signals travel with a known velocity. Time of arrival data from two base stations will narrow a position to a position circle; data from a third base station is required to resolve the precise position to a single point. Many radiolocation systems, including GPS, use ToA. Ways of synchronization As with TDOA, synchronization of the network base station with the locating reference stations is important. This synchronization can be done in different ways: * With exact synchronous clock on both sides. Inaccuracy in the clock synchronization translates directly to an imprecise location. * With two signals which have different frequency, hence different speed. Sound ranging to a lightning strike works this way (speed of light and sound velocity). * Via measurement to or triggering from a common reference point. * Without direct synchronisation, but with compensation of clock phase differences, Two-way ranging Two way ranging is a cooperative method for determining the range between two radio transceiver units. When synchronisation of the oscillators of the involved transmitters is not viable, hence the clocks differ, then applying the measurement as a two ways travel to the receiver and mirrored back to the transmitter compensates for some of the phase differences between the oscillators involved. This concept is applied with the Real-time locating system (RTLS) concept as defined in the international standard ISO/IEC FCD 24730-5.Information technology -- Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) -- Part 5: Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) at 2,4 GHz air interface Literature An introductory description of the concept is given with.RTLS For Dummies by Ajay Malik, Wiley New York 2009 In contrast to some faulty explanations, the concept may be applied as well with IEEE 802.15.4aCSS as with IEEE 802.15.4aUWB modulation.Funknetzwerke daheim See also * Angle of arrival * GSM localization * Multilateration * Ranging * Triangulation * Trilateration References External links * Seminar \\"Security in mobile communication\\", which was held at the Communication Security (COSY) Group at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany Category:Radio Category:Wireless locating Category:Radio geopositioning ","title":"Time of arrival"},{"id":"12407671","text":"Henry Trotter is the name of: *Henry Trotter (British Army officer) (1844–1905), major general *Henry Trotter (Indian Army officer) (1841–1919), officer in the Royal Bengal Engineers and central Asian explorer *Henry Dundas Trotter (1802–1859), Scottish Royal Navy rear-admiral *Henry John Trotter (1835–1888), English barrister, railway director and Conservative politician See also *Edward Henry Trotter (1872–1916), First World War British Army lieutenant-colonel; son of the major general ","title":"Henry Trotter"},{"id":"12407715","text":"Changes is a documentary and live DVD released in September 2004 by American rock band Godsmack.

A remixed version appeared on their debut album All Over the UK (1996) and the song was released as a 12-inch single in 1997. The song achieved mainstream popularity in 2003 when it was covered by Ultrabeat and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Force & Styles version The Force & Styles version was a happy hardcore song which features the vocals of Junior, and was played at Simon and Kerry's wedding – Simon being an MC who had previously performed with Force & Styles when they DJ'd at various hardcore club nights. The song was produced by Force & Styles and recorded with Junior at their own 'UK Dance Studios', in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex in 1996. It first appeared on hardcore compilation albums, and in 1997 it was released on 12\\" vinyl on Force & Styles's own record label UK Dance Records, with a b-side \\"Apollo 13 [pt II] (The Journey Home)\\". The vinyl was also re-released in 2001. This hardcore version, although popular among hardcore listeners, never achieved the same mainstream success as the Ultrabeat cover.

The group used a recording studio in Liverpool where Mike Di Scala was the engineer, and they first recorded the song there, with Mike singing. During the recording session, they did not have a pop filter for the microphone, so they had to use a sock instead. The song was signed by All Around the World because of Di Scala's last single for the label under the Rezonance Q alias. \\"Someday\\", a cover of the Mariah Carey song, had achieved a peak of No. 29 in the charts and when Di Scala was discussing its success with All Around the World, he played them Ultrabeat's demo of \\"Pretty Green Eyes\\". The whistle noise at the start of the song is sampled from House Traffic's 1994 hit \\"Every Day of My Life\\". Chart performance The song became more popular when it was released on promos and Clubland III and played more in nightclubs. It was released as a single in August 2003. It entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 2, behind \\"Breathe\\" by Blu Cantrell, and stayed in the chart for 15 weeks. This led to Ultrabeat performing on Top of the Pops and a lock-out signing in the HMV store in Liverpool. Music video The video was filmed in London and features three young women who are dancers in a strip club. They are putting on their make-up and outfits, then they dance in the strip club, then the video switches to a nightclub, and back between the two. Ultrabeat also appear in the video. They are sitting down on chairs in the strip club and they are also DJing at the nightclub. The video makes use of green lighting and green clothes, and switches between locations after zooming in on one of the girl's green eyes. The original video for \\"Pretty Green Eyes\\" was actually a casino scene filmed at the Baby Blue Bar on the Albert Dock in Liverpool, but was not used as the actual music video. The scene depicts a gorgeous girl with green eyes gambling on the dice table. The dice dealer, Bill Pettrey, was the Deputy General Manager of Leo Casino, one of Liverpool's top night spots on Queen's Dock.

The goal of this meeting was to create a controlling body for motorcycling after the model of other continental organizations. Representatives from France, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, Slovakia, Portugal and Germany were present. With input from the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme, a declaration of intent was adopted. This document stated the goals of the new organisation as being: to promote, develop and help spread motorcycling and its diverse sports amongst the constituent nations of the European Union. With a further meeting on 27 November 1995 in Bratislava, the national federations of Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania and the Czech Republic all expressed an interest in joining the proposed union. At a meeting in Paris on 17 February 1996 the \\"union Européenne de Motocyclisme\\" was created as a controlling body of 21 national federations. Two committees were brought into being, whose fields of application were the sport and/or promotion, tourism, security and transport. The Union was officially recognised by the FIM in 1997 as a continental federation. At an Extraordinary General Assembly held in November 2012, a motion was passed to rename the organisation to FIM Europe. This brought the name in line with the other Continental Unions. As of December 2017, FIM Europe has 47 National Federations (FMNs) and 6 Regional Motorcycling Associations as members.

The system was established in June 2004 by the Council decision 2004/512/EC.2004/512/EC: Council Decision of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) VIS is rolled out on a regional basis, starting on 11 October 2011 with north African countries.Commission Decision of 30 November 2009 determining the first regions for the start of operations of the Visa Information System (VIS) New applicants for a VIS Schengen visa have to travel to the nearest EU consulate to give their biometric information (10 fingerprints and a facial image), which is then entered into the system and remains valid for five years. Information is centrally stored in a database in Strasbourg (with a back-up site in Austria) allowing checks to be made at border crossing points that the person holding the biometric visa is the person who applied for it. Two types of searches are possible: verification and identification, both carried out by the separate Biometric Matching System (BMS). Verification consists of a check that the fingerprints scanned at the border crossing point correspond to those associated with the biometric record attached to the visa (duration approx. 2 seconds). Identification consists of comparing the fingerprints taken at the border crossing post with the contents of the entire database (duration up to 10 minutes). As from its entry into operation, the VIS was gradually rolled out at all national consulates, region by region. On 20 November 2015, all Schengen and Schengen-associated states completed the system's rollout at all national consulates. On 29 February 2016, all official EU border crossing points closed the VIS rollout. The VIS is expected to contain some 70 million visa applications and biometric records at full capacity. VIS aims to prevent visa fraud and visa shopping by applicants between EU member states and to facilitate checks at external border crossing points and within territory of member states, assisting in the identification of listed persons. The bodies having access to VIS are: Consulates, police authorities from member states and Europol. Transfer of data to third countries or international organizations may take place only in an exceptional case of urgency, with the consent of the member state that entered the data. The VIS also assist the Member States competent authorities for asylum.

Background When Poland regained independence in the fall of 1918, the most important task was to create from scratch armed forces of the fledgling republic. Surrounded by hostile neighbors, Poland managed to recover from several conflicts, but the government in Warsaw was well aware that sooner or later there would be new wars. Several historians claim that Marshall Józef Piłsudski and his obsolete notions hampered the development of the Polish Army. Pilsudski was not interested in armored forces and aircraft, he emphasized the importance of cavalry and infantry instead. After his death in 1935, the new Marshall, Edward Rydz-Śmigły immediately decided to start a huge project of modernization of the Army. However, the budget was too tight to cover the gigantic costs. Thus, the idea of the National Defense Fund was born. Creation The Fund was created on April 9, 1936 by a special decree of President Ignacy Mościcki. Its purpose was to collect additional sources of money, necessary for supplying deficiencies in the military equipment of the Polish Army. Means were acquired in different ways, chiefly these were: * selling of state-owned land, controlled by the military, * endowments from state treasury (mostly based on a loan from France), * gifts from both private individuals and private institutions. The response of the nation was immense. Altogether, FON collected around 1 billion zlotys, out of which almost 40 million were made by various gifts from the nation. Patriotic citizens of the whole country would give their personal savings, kids in schools gave their pocket money, in numerous cases people gave their jewelry, precious coins, gold earrings, plates, utensils and anything precious they had in their homes. In several documented cases members of national minorities joined the action. In the town of Krzeszowice, Jews made in 1938 some 17% of the population, but they provided some 36% of money and valuables.Polish-Jewish relationship in Łódź voivodeship, 1938-1939 Also, many celebrities helped with collection. According to Polish music expert Boguslaw Kaczynski, in 1938 and 1939 Jan Kiepura, a famous singer, gave permission for his name to be used on collection boxes. Apart from individuals, several companies helped. Among others, a famous radio factory Elektrit, sponsored in 1937 a RWD-10 airplane. Money was collected not only in Poland - on October 1, 1936 Theophil Starzynski, President of The Polish Falcons of America called for help raise American money in support of the military equipment needs of Poland, threatened by Nazi Germany. Also, Poles from Yugoslavia collected by June 1939 the amount of 380,118 dinars. Polish government divided everything into two groups - cash money and other items. The money was immediately used for purchases of arms and ammunition, distributed to several divisions of the Army. Usually, locals would support their own garrison - e.g. in 1938 kids from Elementary School Number 6 in Płock collected money for a machine gun, presented to the Płock garrison. According to professor Wojciech Roszkowski, in the years 1936-1939 about 3 million Poles provided the Fund with their money or valuables. World War II and its aftermath In September 1939, with the fall of Poland imminent after several weeks of hostilities (see: Polish September Campaign) such items as jewelry, gold and silver were taken to France, by minister and diplomat Waclaw Jedrzejewicz as well as other members of the government. Also, during the war, money and valuables were collected among Polish communities of United States and Canada. In 1945 the Polish government in exile in London decided that FON sources would be used to help members of the disbanded Armia Krajowa. Two years later, the so-called \\"Committee of the Three\\" (General Stanisław Tatar, Colonels Marian Utnik and Stanisław Nowicki), who administered the fund, decided to send it back to Communist-controlled Poland. Until March 1948 it was overseen by the Ministry of Treasury, then passed to the National Bank of Poland. In 1951 parts of it (around 122 kilograms) were smelted into gold bars; fate of some of them is still unknown. What remains, are silver gifts, which are now stored in the Royal Castle in Warsaw.

It is a story about a group of high school students involved in track and field sports, specifically the long jump. The manga consists of 40 chapters (five volumes). Story Teenage long jump prodigy Ozu Takahiro finds himself being stalked by a strange girl from his past who he cannot remember, Yuki Horiguchi, who somehow knows about his secret childhood dream of jumping so far that he goes into orbit. Yuki, who is also a brilliant jumper, is a tsundere (aggressive yet taciturn) character who permanently wears a personal stereo with large headphones to blot out a world she is otherwise unable to cope with. From her arrival Yuki constantly interferes with Ozu's life, showing enormous jealousy towards all his female friends. Ultimately though Ozu and Yuki share a bond: they both secretly dream of jumping into orbit; and Yuki, whose late father turns out to have been an astrophysicist who made a space telescope currently in orbit, is determined to make this impossible dream come true for both of them. Ozu & Yuki in Inu Neko Jump! Inu Neko Jump! contains many plot elements which are a staple of manga stories: a childhood promise or incident; a central male figure who is surrounded by a \\"harem\\" of interested females; an aggressive yet vulnerable female lead. However it develops these elements in its own way to create narrative tension: for instance the principal female, Yuki, is a constantly demanding person, yet fails to make clear what her demands are, and the childhood incident between herself and Ozu is not explained until the final chapters. Instead, and despite many boisterous acts and frequent flashes of the cheesy grin frequently sported by Mitsuru Hattori's characters, she remains ultimately an enigmatic and withdrawn figure, head permanently encased in headphones which serve as both an actual and symbolic refuge from the world. With the underlying theme in hiatus, the story dwells instead on rivalries between the various females, on the sporting ambitions of the various characters, and on developing various risqué sub-plots, all of which are ultimately discarded when the story finally returns to its roots. Characters ;Ozu Takahiro :The main protagonist of the story, he was a former long jump specialist but he gave up his track shoes after failing to get the first place in his high school competition. He is currently in college. His meeting with Yuki re-sparked his long jumping skills and under her constant pestering and challenges (and sometimes threats) he eventually regains his former glory. Ozu is a bit of a pervert and constantly fantasies about the girls around him. Yuki, Nao, Wasuki and even Hoguichi (the younger version) have all been subjects of his fantasies before. He also likes to sleep with Yuki's gym clothes and swimsuit. ;Yuki Horiguchi :A girl from Ozu's past who accidentally hit him in the nose with her shovel when he tried to practice long jumping in the sandbox which she was playing in when they were both still in kindergarten. The hit gave Ozu a nosebleed and it stained her panties when he fell unconscious with his face between her legs thereby prompting her mother's date (not sure if boyfriend or not him being the father was a mistake because her father died) to tease her that Ozu had taken her virginity and that she could no longer be a bride. Her father's words subsequently led to her being the way she was now and treating Ozu as her personal property for having 'deflowered' her. She easily gets jealous whenever she sees Ozu 'plays' with other people besides her and always do everything she can to draw him back. She always wears headphones which blares music into her ears to black out the sounds of the surrounding world thereby giving her a safe refuge in her own world. She is completely helpless without the headphones as is shown when it was broken and she freaked out to the extent of hiding in a side alley until she spotted Ozu. She has long painted fingernails which uses to \\"cat scratch\\" anyone who annoys her. She has low alcohol tolerance and a small drink would get her drunk, a state in which she does all sorts of crazy things. She also frequently pouts and assaults Ozu. ;Wasuki Noriko :Wasuki is a large breasted girl in the same college as Ozu. She is also a member of the track team. She and Ozu first met when she went to his high school for a function and he ran past her while practicing his long jump. Ever since that incident she was smitten by the \\"long-jumping Ozu\\" and always hope to see Ozu return to his former glory self. She is unaware that Ozu likes her until the night when he spends the night at her house and embraces her, however, they were interrupted by Kareishi. She seems to have feelings for Ozu because she gets worked up and uneasy when seeing Ozu with Yuki. She has a best friend whom she constantly calls 'boyfriend' because her name, Kareishi really sounds similar to the word 'boyfriend' in Japanese. ;Nao :A long jump prodigy who proclaims herself Japan's next greatest women's long jump champion. She is extremely arrogant and considers track meets, like the one Wasuki and the others were competing in as small fries, unworthy of her time. She is extremely competitive and wants to be nothing but the best. She does however has a cuter side to her which is shown whenever she thinks she is alone with a mirror where she will have a \\"Cute Nao-chan show\\" which involves her striking all types of cute poses in front of the mirror. Nao is a quick thinker and is also a manipulative person. When Ozu accidentally caught her in the midst of her \\"Nao-chan show\\" she beats him up and when questioned by a passing security guard as to what was she doing sitting aside Ozu as she was beating him up, she immediately pulled her blouse open and set it up to look as if Ozu had tried to rape her and she was just defending herself. She views Yuki as her rival after failing to jump over a pool of water while chasing her after framing Ozu for attempting to rape her. She is also extremely liberal and open about her body. This is shown when she does not hesitate to pull Ozu's dick out and suck his penis to make it stiff in order to frame him and she even feels his penis again when he was having dinner at her house and even commenting on how big he was although he was a 'pervert'. Other incidences include her openly feeling up her younger brother's penis while he feels her boobs in front of Ozu. Her most notably liberal act was in an attempt to lure Yuki out of her house so that she could compete against her in a long-jump rematch, she presses her half naked body up to Ozu and gropes him once more, even going so far as to perform fellatio in front of everyone else until Yuki finally came out.

Though it is known as Patission, its name was changed to 28 October Street, commemorating the day in 1940 that the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas refused the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's ultimatum that Greece submit to Italian control, thus starting the Greco-Italian War. Patission Street connects the area known as Patissia with Omonoia Square in the center of Athens. It is crowded by bus and trolley bus lines, which connect the city center with Kypseli (trolley lines 2, 4, 9), Lamprini (trolley lines 5, 13, 14), Patissia (trolley line 11), N. Filadelpheia (trolley line 3), Perissos (bus lines 605, 054), Marousi (bus line A8) and Galatsi (bus line 608). It is a southbound one-way route with a northbound bus lane until it meets Marnis street, and it has three lanes per direction until Amerikis Square.  History  * The landforming of the road began in 1841 and was based on pre-existing rural roads. * During King Otto's reign the road was often honored by the royal couple. * In the 1870s, there was a small village named Patisia, that was included in the city of Athens and distinguished in Upper and Lower Patissia. * In the 1880s, there walked the horsemen of the newly created, by Efstratios Rallis, \\"Philippos Company\\". * On 23 April 1882 was launched the horsepowered tram from Patission to Syntagma. * In the 20th century new neoclassical, art-deco and modernist buildings were built: Livieratos Palace (Patision 55 and Epirus), G. Isaia (Patision 65 and Julianos). * In 1903, Panagiotis Koutalianos, in an open-air theater opposite the Archaeological Museum, demonstrated his muscular power with various improvised exercises. * Patission was planted in 1908 with the first official division of the city of Athens - following the study of Athanasios Georgiadis - connecting Patisia with Omonia Square in the center of Athens.Then the first electric trams arrived. * In Chaetia (Patision 8), next to Alaska, on Sunday, 20 September 1942, the small ΠΕΑΝ resistance group organized a mass sabotage in the building of the Greek Nazi ΕΣΠΟ organization that recruited young people from Greece for Wehrmacht. * During December 1944, the General Security building was blown up in the corner of Stournari and Patission by the forces of ΕΛΑΣ. * In 1946, after the Occupation, it was renamed 28 October to celebrate the national anniversary of liberation. * On 17 November 1973, the Polytechnic revolt was on the street. * On 18 December 1980, the Minion Mall was wrapped in flames.  Notable buildings on Patission Street  * National Archaeological Museum * National Technical University of Athens *The renovated atrium of the National Archaeological Museum is an oasis of freshness and aesthetic pleasure for the Athenians and visitors of the city.

This was the first-ever tour of Australia by any overseas team and the second tour abroad by an English team, following the one to North America in 1859. The team is sometimes referred to as H. H. Stephenson's XI. Organisers The idea for the tour came from the English proprietors of a Melbourne catering company called Spiers and Pond, which ran the Café de Paris in the city. Spiers was Felix William Spiers and Pond was Christopher Pond. Their representative in England, a Mr Mallam, had tried to interest Charles Dickens in a lecture tour of Australia and New Zealand but without success. Instead, having noted the success of the 1859 venture, and the growing popularity of cricket in Australia, Spiers and Pond decided to attract a team of leading English cricketers. Mallam therefore journeyed to Birmingham in September 1861 to watch the North v. South game at Aston Park. During the game, Mallam met the cricketers at the nearby Hen and Chicken Hotel to make a business proposal. As a result, twelve players agreed to tour Australia the following winter, on terms of £150 per man plus expenses. Squad English cricket team of 1861 just prior to departure for Australia. The team was captained by H. H. Stephenson (Surrey) who was joined by William Caffyn, Will Mortlock, George Griffith, William Mudie, Tom Sewell junior (all Surrey); Roger Iddison, Ned Stephenson (both Yorkshire); Tom Hearne, Charles Lawrence (both Middlesex); George Wells (Sussex); and George Bennett (Kent). Stephenson and Caffyn had toured America in 1859. Tour The team sailed from Liverpool on 20 October in the SS Great Britain, arriving in Melbourne on 24 December. As a team, they played 12 matches that were not first-class, winning 6 and losing 2 with 4 drawn. All but one of these games were against odds of at least 18 to 11. The exception was a one-day single innings match. The first match of the tour, against Victoria in Melbourne, drew 45,000 spectators over three days, enabling Spiers and Pond to pay the tour's expenses after just one match.A. G. Moyes, Australian Cricket: A History, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959, p. 132. Later in January 1862, the team played New South Wales on the Sydney Domain; the Secretary for Lands, John Robertson controversially allowed the promoters to charge admission to the public while arranging a free stand for parliamentarians. The team divided for a match in March 1862 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground that has been called The World v Surrey XI and is rated first- class. The six Surrey players were joined by five locals, who reportedly had Surrey affiliations, to form the Surrey XI; the World XI was formed of the six non-Surrey tourists and another five locals. The World XI won by 6 wickets thanks to an outstanding all-round performance by George Bennett who scored 72 and then took 7-30 and 7-85. This game drew a good attendance of about 8,000. One of the World XI locals was John Conway of Victoria who later managed the first Australian team to tour England. The tour was certainly successful in the long-term sense that it inspired later English teams to visit Australia. The team arrived back in England on 12 May 1862.

Until 1663 the Herengracht reached as far as the present Leidsegracht. From that year on, the fortifications around Amsterdam were expanded, within the Herengracht, the Keizersgracht and the Prinsengracht which were expanded. The digging ended at the river Amstel within a few years. The buyers on the Herengracht were encouraged to buy two lots and built double-wide mansions, and because the three canals here were laid out a little further from each other, and the lots were also deeper. On these large lots, the well-to-do placed their city-palaces with classicist facades, stuccoed ceilings, and fine gardens, once a year open to the public. In the curve, by the Nieuwe Spiegelstraat, lived Amsterdam's richest citizens, and so this part of the belt of canals was named the \\"Golden Bend\\" in recent history. The house of the family De Neufville (1731), located at Herengracht 475 and 476, is known as having the prettiest facades. Herengracht 466, on the corner of the Nieuwe Spiegelstraat was designed by Philip Vingboons and from 1858 until 1926 the office of the Dutch Trade-Society. On the other corner (Herengracht 464) was the office of former lawyer Bram Moszkowicz.

The lighthouse was designed in 1839 by Decimus Burton and Capt H.M. Denham. Burton has been commissioned three years previously by Sir Peter Hesketh Fleetwood as the architect of the new town of Fleetwood. Construction was completed in 1840. Unusually for a functioning British lighthouse, it stands in the middle of a residential street (Pharos Street). Though officially named the 'Upper Lighthouse', it has been known as the 'Pharos' since its construction, after the celebrated ancient lighthouse Pharos of Alexandria. The lighthouse was designed and constructed in conjunction with the much shorter () Lower Lighthouse (also known as Beach Lighthouse) which stands on Fleetwood sea front. The lighthouses are designed to be used as a pair to guide shipping through the treacherous sandbanks of the Wyre estuary. The light from the Pharos should be kept immediately above the light from the Lower for safe passage down the channel. Both lighthouses were first illuminated on 1 December 1840. Each was run off the town's gas supply, with a single parabolic reflector placed behind the burner; later they were converted to electricity. The lamp is approximately above sea level, giving a range of about . For many years, the lighthouse was painted a striking cream and red colour, but in the late 1970s, the original sandstone was again exposed. The Fleetwood terminal loop of the Blackpool tramway runs past the foot of the lighthouse. The lighthouse is managed by the Port of Fleetwood. The interior is closed to the general public.

It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle since LLVM 2.6. It is designed to act as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), supporting most of its compilation flags and unofficial language extensions. Its contributors include Apple, Microsoft, Google, ARM, Sony, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It is open-source software, with source code released under the University of Illinois/NCSA License, a permissive free software licence. Since v9.0.0, it was relicensed to the Apache License 2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. Clang 10, the latest major version of Clang as of August 2020, has full support for all published C++ standards and partial support for the upcoming C++20 standard. Since v6.0.0, Clang compiles C++ using the GNU++14 dialect by default, which includes features from the C++14 standard and conforming GNU extensions. The Clang project includes the Clang front end, a static analyzer, and several code analysis tools.  Background  Starting in 2005, Apple Inc. made extensive use of LLVM in a number of commercial products, including the iOS SDK and Xcode 3.1. One of the first uses of LLVM was an OpenGL code compiler for OS X that converts OpenGL calls into more fundamental calls for graphics processing units (GPU) that do not support certain features. This allowed Apple to support OpenGL on computers using Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) chipsets, increasing performance on those machines. For GPUs that support it, the code is compiled to fully exploit the underlying hardware, but on GMA machines, LLVM compiles the same OpenGL code into subroutines to ensure continued proper function. LLVM was intended originally to use GCC's front end, but GCC turned out to cause some problems for developers of LLVM and at Apple. The GCC source code is a large and somewhat cumbersome system for developers to work with; as one long-time GCC developer put it referring to LLVM, \\"Trying to make the hippo dance is not really a lot of fun\\". Apple software makes heavy use of Objective-C, but the Objective-C front-end in GCC is a low priority for GCC developers. Also, GCC does not integrate smoothly into Apple's integrated development environment (IDE). Finally, GCC is licensed under the terms of GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, which requires developers who distribute extensions for, or modified versions of, GCC to make their source code available, whereas LLVM has a BSD-like licenseClang team, clang: a C language family frontend for LLVM which does not have such a requirement. Apple chose to develop a new compiler front end from scratch, supporting C, Objective-C and C++. This \\"clang\\" project was open-sourced in July 2007.  Design  Clang is intended to work on top of LLVM. The combination of Clang and LLVM provides most of the toolchain, to allow replacing the full GCC stack. Because it is built with a library-based design, like the rest of LLVM, Clang is easy to embed into other applications. This is one reason why most OpenCL implementations are built with Clang and LLVM. One of Clang's main goals is to provide a library-based architecture,Clang: Utility and Applications: Library Based Architecture to allow the compiler to be more tightly tied to tools that interact with source code, such as an integrated development environment (IDE) graphical user interface (GUI). In contrast, GCC is designed to work in a compile-link-debug workflow, and integrating it with other tools is not always easy. For instance, GCC uses a step called fold that is key to the overall compile process, which has the side effect of translating the code tree into a form that looks unlike the original source code. If an error is found during or after the fold step, it can be difficult to translate that back into one location in the original source. Also, vendors using the GCC stack within IDEs use separate tools to index the code, to provide features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete. Clang is designed to retain more information during the compiling process than GCC, and to preserve the overall form of the original code. The goal of this is to make it easier to map errors back into the original source. The error reports offered by Clang are also aimed to be more detailed and specific, as well as machine-readable, so IDEs can index the output of the compiler during compiling. Modular design of the compiler can offer source code indexing, syntax checking, and other features normally associated with rapid application development systems. The parse tree is also more suitable for supporting automated code refactoring, as it directly represents the original source code. Clang compiles only C-like languages, such as C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, OpenCL, CUDA, and HIP. For other languages, like Ada, LLVM remains dependent on GCC or another compiler frontend. In many cases, Clang can be used or swapped out for GCC as needed, with no other effects on the toolchain as a whole. It supports most of the commonly used GCC options. A sub-project Flang by Nvidia and The Portland Group added Fortran support.FLANG: NVIDIA Brings Fortran To LLVM Performance and GCC compatibility Clang is designed to be highly compatible with GCC. Clang's command-line interface is similar to and shares many flags and options with GCC. Clang implements many GNU language extensions and enables them by default. Clang implements many GCC compiler intrinsics purely for compatibility. For example, even though Clang implements atomic intrinsics which correspond exactly with C11 atomics, it also implements GCC's \`__sync_*\` intrinsics for compatibility with GCC and libstdc++. Clang also maintains ABI compatibility with GCC-generated object code. In practice Clang can often be used as a drop-in replacement for GCC. Clang's developers aim to reduce memory footprint and increase compilation speed compared to competing compilers, such as GCC. In October 2007, they report that Clang compiled the Carbon libraries more than twice as fast as GCC, while using about one-sixth GCC's memory and disk space. However, as of 2011 this was not a typical result. As of mid-2014, Clang won more than a third of the benchmarks, with GCC winning most. As of 2014, performance of Clang-compiled programs lagged behind performance of the GCC-compiled program, sometimes by large factors (up to 5.5x), replicating earlier reports of slower performance. More recent comparisons in November 2016 indicate that both compilers have evolved to increase their performance. As of GCC 4.8.2 versus clang 3.4, on a large harness of test files, GCC outperforms clang by approximately 17% on well-optimized source code. Test results are code-specific, and unoptimized C source code can reverse such differences. The two compilers now seem broadly comparable.

The preparation of the combination Mars Observer and Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) before their integration into the payload top of Titan III The Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) was an upper stage developed by Martin Marietta for Orbital Sciences Corporation during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The TOS was designed to be a lower-cost alternative to Inertial Upper Stage and Centaur G upper stages. The TOS was designed to be deployed by the Titan 34D, Commercial Titan III and Space Shuttle. The main propulsion system of the Transfer Orbit Stage was an Orbus 21 solid rocket motor. Attitude control was provided by hydrazine thrusters. The inertial guidance system used a ring laser gyroscope produced by Honeywell. Its control system employed a digital optimal, time-scheduled control algorithm to provide stability whilst the Orbus 21 was burning, while a phase-plane controller was used to manage its reaction-control system. Only two Transfer Orbit Stages were launched. The first was launched on 25 September 1992, aboard a Commercial Titan III with the Mars Observer spacecraft bound for Mars. Despite a successful launch, the Mars Observer spacecraft later malfunctioned. The second use of a TOS was the deployment of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite from on mission STS-51. This was also successful. The Transfer Orbit Stage was designed to separate from the Space Shuttle via pyrotechnic devices enclosed in a frangible metal joint known as a Super*Zip. On STS-51, the primary and backup pyrotechnic devices inside the Super*Zip were erroneously fired simultaneously, resulting in minor damage to both the TOS, and the Shuttle's payload bay lining. However, the ACTS satellite deployed successfully and functioned normally on orbit. The Shuttle landed safely despite the anomaly.

She was born in Cali, Colombia and in 1982 moved to New York City, where she lived and studied. In 1988, in a nationwide televised competition, Franco was crowned Miss Colombia USA. Franco became a TV commercial and editorial model and in December 1990 appeared on her first cover of Cosmopolitan en Español. In Peru, La Modelo Latina Pageant 1991 awarded her La Silueta Diet-Coke title. In 1992, Franco was approached to participate in Buscando Estrellas Con Budweiser, the Spanish-version of Star Search, where -once again – won first place. Later that same year, Cover Girl Make-Up chose her to be one of the faces for their TV campaigns for the Hispanic market alongside of Barbara Palacios (Miss Universe 1986). After traveling and working around the world, including places such as Taipei, Istanbul and Hong Kong, Franco decided to stay in the U.S. to pursue her acting career in her native language. In 1992 Salvese Quien Pueda (SQP), a weekly comedy show that aired on the Telemundo Network made her part of their regular cast. In SQP she developed and often played Vicky Bikini, a girl who always did her errands wearing only a bikini, high hills and a handbag so she would never have to make a line. Vicky Bikini soon became one of the shows most requested characters. In 1995, Univision Network hired Franco as the female VJ for Caliente, one of its most widely seen weekend TV shows. Caliente gave Franco the opportunity to interact with her young Latino audience while traveling to exotic beaches around the world. Two years later, Franco was asked to be part of Edición Especial (Telemundo Network), which earned her the anchor star status in the Spanish market. She was also in charged of hosting most of Telemundo's specials for the network. In 1998 she landed the role of Sylvia La Rosen in Safe Harbor (Aaron Spelling) which aired in WB Network. Glamour en Español magazine recognized her with the Most Glamorous Woman Award 1998 and in 1999 People en Español places Franco as one of the “25 Most Beautiful People” along with faces such as Salma Hayek and Ricky Martin. In 2002, Franco traveled back to her native Colombia to portray Sandra, a cocaine manufacturer in the soap opera El Precio del Silencio (Telefutura Network). In October 2006, Franco had the opportunity to be part of the very-selected cast of the short film: Marrying God (AFI) where she played Maricela, the single mother of Lola played by Ashlyn Sanchez (Crash) and Ivy played by Alexa Vega (Spy Kids). Franco has also developed the \\"Life Style Specialist\\" title, and is often featured in US Spanish TV station across the nation. In Pecados Ajenos, a Telemundo Studios production, Franco played Lola, the cellmate of Natalia -played by Lorena Rojas- and later, Oficial Joyer, in El Rostro de Analía alongside of Elizabeth Gutiérrez. At the end of 2009, Franco was called to play Berta, a lonely bitter architect designer in the new version of Perro Amor, but due to a skiing accident, where she suffered several fractures, her role was eventually withdrawn. It took her several months to recuperate from her injuries. In 2010, Franco became part of the selected cast of the new version of the Chilean soap opera, Alguien Te Mira (2010), produced this time by Telemundo Television Studios in the USA.

It was short lived, running from June 1899 to September 1901. Churchill's son, Winston Churchill, was one of her devoted advisors during the months preceding publication. He suggested that the magazine take as its purpose \\"to preserve a permanent record of the thoughts and aspirations of our times, which vary as swiftly as light changes on running water, for wiser ages yet unborn.\\" It contained articles by Henry James, Winston Churchill, George Gissing, Stephen Crane, Henry De Vere Stacpoole, Robert Barr, Henry Duff Traill, Henry Swinburne, Ethel Rolt Wheeler, Henry Watson Fowler and Frank Swettenham. Each issue was individually decorated in an elaborate pattern of gilt tooling on leather covers. The subscription list included heads of state, royalty, and some of the wealthiest families of Britain and the United States. Many of the magazine's contributors, too, were members of the nobility, officers of the Church of England, members of parliament, titled servants of the crown, and foreign dignitaries.

Description The long-billed crow is a large crow growing from in length including its relatively short tail. The large bill tapers from a broad base and is black, as are the legs and feet. The plumage is glossy and entirely black. The call of this crow has been likened to the yapping of a puppy \\"cruk ... cruk ... cruk\\". The long-billed crow can be differentiated from other crows by its large size and glossy plumage, its long beak and its white iris. The only other crow within its range is the Torresian crow (Corvus orru) which has a much smaller beak and inhabits more open areas rather than forests. Distribution and habitat The long-billed crow is endemic to the Maluku Islands, an archipelago within Indonesia. It is a forest-dwelling bird and is mainly found on the islands of Morotai, Obira, Kayoa, Kasiruta, Bacan and Halmahera. Status The long- billed crow has a restricted range with a total area of occupancy of about . The forests in which it lives are being degraded and the population of the crow is estimated to be declining. However, it is a common bird and seems able to adapt to a certain extent to secondary forests, partly logged areas, plantations and cultivated areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, for a long period of time, rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\" but has now upgraded this to \\"near threatened\\" because populations seem to be declining more rapidly than was previously thought.

Outside academia, he is best known as the chair of the Pennington Group enquiry into the Scottish Escherichia coli outbreak of 1996 and as Chairman of the Public Inquiry into the 2005 Outbreak of E. coli O157 in South Wales. Early life Pennington was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School in Lancashire, England. Pennington obtained his MBBS degree in 1962, and his PhD in 1967, both from St Thomas's Hospital Medical School, which became part of United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals in 1982, and has been known as King's College London School of Medicine and Dentistry since 2005.  Academic career  He spent a year at the University of Wisconsin–Madison before moving to the Glasgow Institute of Virology in 1969, where he researched vaccinia, smallpox and other viruses. He was appointed Chair of Bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen in 1979, where he remained until his retirement in 2003. His research focused on improved bacteria typing, or \\"fingerprinting\\", methods, and led to new methods for the investigation of virulence and antibiotic resistance in a number of important pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. He also wrote on the history of science and medicine such as the introduction of antiseptic surgery to Aberdeen by Alexander Ogston using a Lister 'steam spray producer'. He was dean of the medical school between 1987 and 1992. Pennington was also awarded a higher doctorate, i.e. DSc. He retired in 2003 after being a professor of bacteriology for 23 years at the University of Aberdeen. From 2003-6 he was President of the Society for General Microbiology. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.  Pennington Group enquiry  In late November 1996, an Escherichia coli outbreak in the town of Wishaw, central Scotland prompted the Scottish Office to establish an expert group, chaired by Pennington. The Pennington Group convened between December 1996 and March 1997. Another case of E. coli infection occurred in Tayside in January 1997 and the group was tasked with investigating the additional outbreak.  Subsequent public work  Following his chairmanship of the E. coli enquiry, Pennington has worked for the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments as an expert on microbiology and food safety, and has also appeared in British media as an expert. He was a member of the Scottish Food Advisory Committee, part of the Food Standards Agency, an agency he recommended the government create. He was a founder member of the World Food Programme Technical Advisory Group. He is the former Vice Chair of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, which advises the BBC. He has criticised the UK and German governments for their handling of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the NHS for their handling of MRSA. He chaired a 2005 enquiry into a Welsh E. coli outbreak. The 2005 Outbreak of E. coli O157 in South Wales Public Inquiry report was published in March 2009. In 2003, Pennington published When Food Kills, a popular science book on the topic of BSE, E. coli and public food safety. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to microbiology and food hygiene.

MacPhail was working as a security guard at a Burger King restaurant when he intervened to defend a man being assaulted in a nearby parking lot. During Davis's 1991 trial, seven witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail, and two others testified Davis had confessed the murder to them. There were 34 witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and six others for the defense, including Davis. Although the murder weapon was not recovered, ballistic evidence presented at trial linked bullets recovered at or near the scene to those at another shooting in which Davis was also charged. He was convicted of murder and various lesser charges, including the earlier shooting, and was sentenced to death in August 1991. Davis maintained his innocence up to his execution. In the 20 years between his conviction and execution, Davis and his defenders secured support from the public, celebrities, and human rights groups. Amnesty International and other groups such as National Association for the Advancement of Colored People took up Davis's cause. Prominent politicians and leaders, including former President Jimmy Carter, Rev. Al Sharpton, Pope Benedict XVI, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former U.S. Congressman from Georgia and presidential candidate Bob Barr, and former FBI Director and judge William S. Sessions called upon the courts to grant Davis a new trial or evidentiary hearing. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled, but each execution was stayed shortly before it was to take place. In 2009, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to consider whether new evidence \\"that could not have been obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes [Davis'] innocence\\". The evidentiary hearing was held in June 2010. The defense presented affidavits from seven of the nine trial witnesses whose original testimony had identified Davis as the murderer, but who it contended had changed or recanted their previous testimony. Some of these writings disavowed parts of prior testimony, or implicated Sylvester \\"Redd\\" Coles, who Davis contended was the actual triggerman. The state presented witnesses, including the police investigators and original prosecutors, who described a careful investigation of the crime, without any coercion. Davis did not call some of the witnesses who had supposedly recanted, despite their presence in the courthouse; accordingly their affidavits were given little weight by the judge. Evidence that Coles had confessed to the killing was excluded as hearsay because Coles was not subpoenaed by the defense to rebut it. In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld. The court described defense efforts to upset the conviction as \\"largely smoke and mirrors\\" and found that several of the proffered affidavits were not recantations at all. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected, and a fourth execution date was set for September 21, 2011. Nearly one million people signed petitions urging the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to grant clemency. The Board denied clemency and, on September 21, it refused to reconsider its decision. After a last minute appeal to the United States Supreme Court was denied, the sentence was carried out through lethal injection on September 21, 2011. Events of August 18–23, 1989 The charges against Troy Davis arose from the shooting of Michael Cooper, the beating of Larry Young and the murder of Officer Mark MacPhail on August 18–19, 1989. On the evening of August 18, 1989, Davis attended a pool party in the Cloverdale neighborhood of Savannah, Georgia. As he left the party with his friend Daryl Collins, the occupants of a passing car yelled obscenities and began shooting at a gathering of neighborhood teenagers. One of the teenagers returned fire, and Michael Cooper, a passenger, was struck in the jaw. Davis and Collins then went to a pool hall on Oglethorpe Avenue in the Yamacraw Village section of Savannah. Later that evening, Davis and Collins proceeded to the parking lot of a Burger King restaurant on Oglethorpe Avenue, not far from the pool hall. There they encountered Sylvester \\"Redd\\" Coles arguing with a homeless man, Larry Young, over alcohol. Young was pistol-whipped, but could not identify his attacker. At about 1:15 am on August 19, 1989, Mark MacPhail, an off-duty police officer who was working as a security guard at the Burger King, attempted to intervene in the pistol-whipping of Young at the parking lot. MacPhail was shot twice: once through the heart and once in the face. He did not draw his gun. Bullets and shell casings which were determined to have come from a .38-caliber pistol were retrieved from the crime scene. Witnesses to the shooting agreed that a man in a white shirt had struck Young and then shot MacPhail. On August 19, Coles told Savannah Police he had seen Davis with a .38-caliber pistol, and that Davis had assaulted Young. Coles failed to tell police that he owned a .38 caliber weapon and was in possession of that weapon on the night of the shooting. The same evening as the shooting, Davis drove to Atlanta with his sister. In the early morning of August 20, 1989, Savannah Police searched the Davis home but all they found was a pair of Davis' shorts in a clothes dryer. Davis's family began negotiating with police, motivated by concerns about his safety. On August 23, 1989, Davis returned to Savannah, surrendered himself to police and was charged with MacPhail's murder. The murder weapon was never recovered, and Mr. Coles told police that he had lost his .38 caliber weapon before it could be tested. Background of Troy Davis Davis was the eldest child of Korean War veteran Joseph Davis and hospital worker Virginia Davis. The couple divorced when Davis was very young, and Davis grew up with four siblings in the predominantly black, middle-class neighborhood of Cloverdale in Savannah, Georgia. Davis attended Windsor Forest High School, where one teacher described him as a poor student. He dropped out in his junior year so he could drive his disabled younger sister to her rehabilitation. Davis obtained his high-school equivalency diploma from Richard Arnold Education Center in 1987. A teacher noted that he attended school regularly but seemed to lack discipline. Davis's nickname at the time was \\"Rah,\\" or \\"Rough as Hell,\\" but some neighbors reported that it did not reflect his behavior; they described him as a \\"straight-up fellow\\" who acted as a big brother to local children. In July 1988, Davis pleaded guilty to carrying a concealed weapon; he was fined $250 as part of a plea agreement in which a charge of possession of a gun with altered serial numbers was dropped. In August 1988, Davis began work as a drill technician at a plant that manufactured railroad crossing gates. His boss commented that while Davis was a likeable and good worker who appeared to have positive life goals, his job attendance was poor; by Christmas 1988, he had stopped coming to work. Davis returned to the job twice in the following months but neither time remained for long. Davis was a coach in the Savannah Police Athletic League and had signed up for service in the United States Marine Corps. Background of Mark MacPhail Mark Allen MacPhail, Sr., was 27 years old at the time of his murder. He was the son of a U.S. Army colonel, was married, and was father to a two-year-old daughter and an infant son. He had joined the Savannah Police Department in 1986 following six years of military service as an Army Ranger. MacPhail had worked for three years as a regular patrol officer and in the summer of 1989 had applied to train as a mounted police officer. Hundreds of mourners, including county, state, and federal law enforcement officers, attended MacPhail's funeral at Trinity Lutheran Church in Savannah on August 22, 1989. Trial and conviction Pre-trial proceedings On November 15, 1989, a grand jury indicted Davis for murder, assaulting Larry Young with a pistol, shooting Michael Cooper, obstructing MacPhail in performance of his duty and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Davis pleaded not guilty in April 1990. In November 1990, the presiding judge excluded forensic evidence from the pair of shorts seized at the Davis home. The judge ruled that Davis's mother did \\"not freely and voluntarily grant the police the right to search her home.\\" She had testified that police officers had threatened to break down her door unless she let them into her home. The Georgia Supreme Court upheld the exclusion of the evidence in May 1991, saying that the police should have obtained a search warrant. Davis was brought to trial in August 1991. Prosecution case The prosecution claimed that Davis had shot Cooper in Cloverdale, then met up with Redd Coles at a pool hall, pistol-whipped the homeless man Larry Young in the parking lot and then killed Mark MacPhail. The prosecution called three eyewitnesses to the shooting of Cooper: * Cooper testified that he was intoxicated at the time he was shot, and that although Davis was one of the people Cooper had quarrelled with, he \\"don't know me well enough to shoot me.\\" * Benjamin Gordon stated that the man who had shot Cooper had been wearing a white Batman T-shirt and blue shorts. On cross-examination Gordon admitted he had not seen the person who shot Cooper and stated that he did not know Davis. * Daryl Collins made a statement to police on August 19, 1989 that he had seen Davis shoot at the car in which Cooper was travelling. However, on cross-examination at trial, Collins denied having seen Davis carrying or shooting a gun on the night in question. Collins, who was 16 at the time he made the initial statement, claimed police officers had told him he would be imprisoned if he refused to co-operate with the investigation. The prosecution called a number of eyewitnesses to MacPhail's murder: * Antoine Williams testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had struck Young and then shot MacPhail. * Harriet Murray and Dorothy Ferrell testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had struck Young and shot MacPhail. They testified Davis shot MacPhail again after he fell to the ground wounded. * Coles testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had shot MacPhail. Coles admitted arguing with Young but claimed it was Davis who had hit him with a pistol. On cross-examination, Coles admitted that he owned a .38-caliber pistol but testified he had given it to another man earlier on the night in question. * Air Force personnel Robert Grizzard and Steven Sanders were also called by the prosecution. Sanders identified Davis as MacPhail's murderer while Grizzard stated he could not identify the gunman. * Daryl Collins claimed in a police statement to have seen Davis approach MacPhail. However, as with the Cooper shooting claims (above), Collins retracted the statement on cross-examination. Two witnesses to whom Davis was claimed to have confessed were called at trial: * Jeffrey Sapp was a neighbor of the Davis family. He testified that Davis confessed to him soon after the murder. * Kevin McQueen was an acquaintance of Davis who had been held at Chatham County Jail at the same time as Davis. McQueen claimed that Davis had admitted to being involved in the \\"exchange of gunfire\\" in which Cooper was shot and to have shot MacPhail because he was \\"paranoid...they'd seen him that night in Cloverdale.\\" In total, thirty five witnesses testified at trial for the prosecution. The prosecution did not produce a weapon (neither the gun which Davis was said to have used nor the gun owned by Coles) as evidence. A ballistics expert testified that the .38 caliber bullet that killed MacPhail \\"could have been fired from the same gun\\" that wounded Cooper, but that conclusion was not definitive. The expert stated that he was confident that .38 casings found at Cloverdale matched bullet casings found near the scene of MacPhail's shooting, but could not tie the casings to the bullet that killed MacPhail. Defense case Davis denied shooting Cooper and denied shooting MacPhail. Davis testified to having seen Coles assault Young, and Davis said that he had fled the scene before any shots were fired and, therefore, did not know who had shot MacPhail. Six witnesses, including Davis, testified at trial for the defense. Davis's mother testified that Davis had been at home on August 19, 1989, until he left for Atlanta with his sister at about 9 pm. Verdict and sentencing On August 28, 1991, the jury took under two hours to find Davis guilty of murder, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and obstruction of a law enforcement officer. The prosecution sought the death penalty during sentencing proceedings for the murder conviction. Davis and three of his family members testified on Davis's behalf. In a final address to the jury, Davis pleaded, \\"Spare my life. Just give me a second chance. That's all I ask.\\" He told jurors he was convicted for \\"offenses I didn't commit.\\" MacPhail's family members and friends were not allowed to testify. On August 30, 1991, after seven hours of deliberation, the jury rendered a death verdict and Davis was then sentenced to death by the judge. Appeals and challenges to conviction and sentence First appellate proceedings Since the death penalty was imposed, both the conviction and sentence were automatically appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. Davis and his lawyers requested a new trial, citing problems with the trial site and selection of the jury. The request was denied in March 1992. In March 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court also upheld Davis's conviction and sentence, ruling that the judge had correctly refused to change trial site and that the racial composition of the jury did not deny his rights. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in November 1993. Direct appeals having been exhausted, in March 1994 an order was signed for Davis's execution. First habeas corpus proceedings In 1994, Davis began habeas corpus proceedings, filing a petition in state court alleging that he had been wrongfully convicted and that his death sentence was a miscarriage of justice. The following year, the federal funding of the Georgia Resource Center, which helped represent Davis, was cut by 70%, leading to the departures of most of the center's lawyers and investigators. According to a later affidavit by the Executive Director, the \\"work conducted on Mr. Davis's case was akin to triage... There were numerous witnesses that we knew should have been interviewed, but lacked the resources to do so.\\" The appeal stated that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses had been coerced by law enforcement personnel. The petition was denied in September 1997, with the court ruling that claims of improper law enforcement approaches should have been raised earlier in the appeal process, and the court could not usurp the jury's role to evaluate the evidence offered during the trial. The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of state habeas corpus relief on November 13, 2000. In 2000 Davis challenged his conviction in state court. He alleged that the use of the electric chair during executions in Georgia constituted cruel and unusual punishment. By a 4–3 margin the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the challenge, stating once again that Davis should have raised the issue earlier in the appeal process. Federal appeals In December 2001, Davis filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court. From 1996 onwards, seven of the nine principal prosecution eyewitnesses changed all or part of their trial testimony. Dorothy Ferrell, for example, stated in a 2000 affidavit that she felt under pressure from police to identify Davis as the shooter because she was on parole for a shoplifting conviction. In a 2002 affidavit, Darrell Collins wrote that the police had scared him into falsely testifying by threatening to charge him as an accessory to the crime, and alleged that he had not seen Davis do anything to Young. Antoine Williams, Larry Young and Monty Holmes also stated in affidavits that their earlier testimony implicating Davis had been coerced by strong-arm police tactics. In addition, three witnesses signed affidavits stating that Red Coles had confessed to the murder to them. The State of Georgia argued that the evidence had been procedurally defaulted since it should have been introduced earlier. Davis's petition was denied in May 2004; the judge stated in an opinion that the \\"submitted affidavits are insufficient to raise doubts as to the constitutionality of the result at trial, there is no danger of a miscarriage of justice in declining to consider the claim.\\" He also rejected other defense contentions about unfair jury selection, ineffective defense counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The decision was appealed to the 11th Circuit Court, which heard oral arguments in the case in September 2005. On September 26, 2006, the court affirmed the denial of federal habeas corpus relief, and determined that Davis had not made \\"a substantive claim of actual innocence\\" or shown that his trial was constitutionally unfair; the circuit court found that neither prosecutors nor defense counsel had acted improperly or incompetently at trial. A petition for panel rehearing was denied in December 2006. Legal experts argued that a major obstacle to granting Davis a new trial was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, passed after the Oklahoma City bombing, which bars death row inmates from later presenting evidence they could have presented at trial. Members of the legal community have criticized the restricting effect of the 1996 Act on the ability of wrongfully convicted persons to prove their innocence. First execution date On June 25, 2007, Davis's first certiorari petition to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied, and his execution was then set for July 17, 2007. Davis's case gained increasing public exposure and support from organizations and prominent individuals. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged the courts to agree to hear the evidence of police coercion and recanted testimony. An appeal to Governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue urging him to spare Davis's life was sent on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Similar appeals were sent by singer Harry Belafonte, Sister Helen Prejean, author of Dead Man Walking, and actor Mike Farrell. Amnesty International published a report about Davis's case characterizing it as a miscarriage of justice and a \\"catastrophic flaw in the U.S. death penalty machine.\\" The human rights group initiated a letter-writing campaign and delivered 4,000 letters to the clemency board. William S. Sessions, former FBI Director and federal judge, called on authorities to halt the execution process, writing that \\"[i]t would be intolerable to execute a man without his claims of innocence ever being considered by the courts or by the executive\\". Politicians and others such as Jesse Jackson, Jr. and Sheila Jackson Lee, and former Texas District Attorney Sam D. Millsap, Jr., and the organization Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation requested that the courts grant Davis a new trial. U.S. Congressman John Lewis spoke to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, suggesting that Coles – one of the witnesses who had not recanted – was the real killer. Representatives from the Council of Europe and European Parliament also spoke out on Davis's case, asking U.S. authorities to halt the planned execution and calling for a new trial. On July 16, 2007, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a ninety-day stay of execution in order to allow the evaluation of evidence presented, including the doubts about Davis's guilt. The stay was superseded by the August 2007 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court to grant Davis' application for discretionary appeal from the denial of his Extraordinary Motion for a New Trial. Defense lawyers requested a new trial based on statements of mistaken identity. On March 17, 2008, the Georgia Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 4–3 majority. The majority wrote that the recanting witnesses \\"have merely stated they now do not feel able to identify the shooter\\", that the trial testimony could not be ignored, and that they \\"in fact, favor[ed] that original testimony over the new.\\" In dissent, the Chief Justice wrote that \\"if recantation testimony, either alone or supported by other evidence, shows convincingly that prior trial testimony was false, it simply defies all logic and morality to hold that it must be disregarded categorically\\". Second execution date In July 2008, Davis's lawyers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Georgia Supreme Court decision and arguing that the Eighth Amendment creates a substantive right of the innocent not to be executed. However, an execution date was scheduled for September 23, 2008, before the United States Supreme Court decided whether to take up Davis's case. The Georgia Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution and the Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency. left Amnesty International condemned the decision to deny clemency, and former President (and Georgia Governor) Jimmy Carter released a public letter in which he stated \\"Executing Troy Davis without a real examination of potentially exonerating evidence risks taking the life of an innocent man and would be a grave miscarriage of justice.\\" Reverend Al Sharpton also called for clemency after he met and prayed with Davis on death row. A stay of execution was also supported by the NAACP; the president of the Georgia state conference said \\"This is a modern-day lynching if it's allowed to go forward.\\" Former Republican Congressman and Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr wrote that he is \\"a strong believer in the death penalty as an appropriate and just punishment,\\" but that the proper level of fairness and accuracy required for the ultimate punishment has not been met in Davis's case. A last-minute emergency stay, issued by the Supreme Court less than two hours before Davis was scheduled to be put to death, halted the execution. Lawyers for Davis argued that lower courts had failed to permit a hearing to carefully examine the recanted testimony and four witnesses who implicated Coles. Lawyers for the Georgia attorney general's office argued that most of the affidavits had already been presented and reviewed, and that questions about the quality and credibility of the witnesses were raised at the initial trial. On October 14, 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear Davis's petition, and a new execution date was set for October 27, 2008. Third execution date On October 21, 2008, Davis's lawyers requested an emergency stay of the pending execution, and three days later the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of execution to consider a newly filed federal habeas petition. Davis's supporters continued their appeals and actions; these included rallies held worldwide, a petition with 140,000 signatures presented to the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, and an appeal from the European Union calling for the death sentence to be commuted. In contrast, the Chatham County prosecutors asserted that Davis was guilty and deserved the death penalty. M-1 speaks at a rally held in 2009 in New York City in support of Troy Davisthumbright Oral arguments were heard by a three-judge panel on December 9 in Atlanta. Davis's lawyers again argued that exculpatory affidavits proving Davis innocent had not been examined in a court of law; they noted the witnesses who had implicated Coles, and that his photo was not included among those shown to witnesses in the case. The Senior Assistant Attorney General argued that, in extraordinary cases, evidence of wrongful conviction could be heard at this stage of the appeals process, but that in this case the recantation evidence was untrustworthy, and are generally regarded with the \\"highest suspicion.\\" Multiple courts and boards had also previously declined appeals. During the hearing, judge Joel F. Dubina commented: \\"As bad as it would be to execute an innocent man, it's also possible the real guilty person who shot Officer MacPhail is not being prosecuted.\\" Another judge, Stanley Marcus, noted that two of the witnesses had not changed their recollections, and that no DNA evidence was available to categorically clear Davis. After the hearing, Davis's sister, Martina Correia, an active campaigner for her brother stated \\"This is not family against family. We have no ill will against the MacPhail family. When justice is found for Troy, there will be justice for Officer MacPhail.\\" On April 16, 2009, the panel denied Davis's application by a 2–1 majority. Judges Dubina and Marcus rejected the petition, stating that Davis's claims having been reviewed and rejected in the past, and that the recantations were not persuasive. Judge Rosemary Barkett, in dissent, expressed her belief that as Davis might prove his innocence, it would be wrong to execute him. In an interview, Mark MacPhail Jr. said of his father, \\"He gave his life for the community and now I'm trying to help out his name and help him in some way.\\" Of the appeals process, he says, \\"The past two years we've had countless appeals and it just keeps on getting drug out.\\" Of Davis, MacPhail said, \\"He decided to break the law. And our law says, you kill an officer of the law, who tries to uphold it, you must be punished.\\" The 11th Circuit issued an order extending the stay of execution for 30 days to allow Davis the opportunity to file a habeas corpus petition with the U.S. Supreme Court. Davis filed a petition for habeas corpus with the U.S. Supreme Court on May 19, 2009. On August 17, 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the Savannah federal district court to \\"receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes [Davis'] innocence.\\" Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, wrote that \\"[t]he substantial risk of putting an innocent man to death clearly provides an adequate justification for holding an evidentiary hearing.\\" Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, stating that a new hearing would be \\"a fool's errand\\" because Davis's claim of innocence was \\"a sure loser\\". He was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Federal hearing In response to the Supreme Court order, a two-day hearing was held in June 2010 in a federal district court in Savannah in front of Judge William Moore. Benjamin Gordon testified that he was present on the night Officer MacPhail was killed and saw that his uncle, Sylvester Coles, was the shooter. Former prosecution witness Antoine Williams stated he did not know who had shot MacPhail, and that because he was illiterate he could not read the police statements he had signed in 1989. Other prosecution witnesses Jeffrey Sapp and Kevin McQueen testified that Davis had not confessed to them as they had stated at the initial trial. Darrell Collins also recanted his previous evidence that he had seen Davis shoot Cooper and MacPhail. The witnesses variously described their previous testimony against Davis as being the result of feeling scared, of feeling frightened and pressured by police or to get revenge in a conflict with Davis. Anthony Hargrove testified that Redd Coles had admitted the killing to him. The state's lawyers described Hargrove's testimony as hearsay evidence; Judge William T. Moore permitted the evidence but stated that unless Coles appeared, he might give the evidence \\"no weight whatsoever.\\" Another witness making a similar statement was heard, but a third was rejected by Judge Moore as the claims were inadmissible hearsay because Coles was not called as a witness and given the opportunity for rebuttal. Moore criticized the decision not to call Coles, saying that he was \\"one of the most critical witnesses to Davis's defense\\". One of Davis's lawyers stated that the day before they had been unsuccessful in serving a subpoena on Coles; Moore responded that the attempt had been made too late, given that the hearing date had been set months in advance. State attorneys called current and former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened. The lead detective testified that his investigation was \\"very meticulous and careful… I was in no rush just to pick the first guy we got our hands on. I wanted the right guy.\\" He stated that witnesses gave \\"strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed\\", mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening. A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming. In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles, but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal. Moore ruled that executing an innocent person would violate the Eighth Amendment. \\"However, Mr. Davis is not innocent.\\" In his decision, Moore wrote: \\"while Mr. Davis's new evidence casts some additional, minimal doubt on his conviction, it is largely smoke and mirrors.\\" Moore gave Benjamin Gordon's testimony no credit because the testimony came late and the judge believed Gordon would say anything to help Mr. Davis, despite no evidence that Mr. Gordon knew Mr. Davis. Of the seven papers described as recantations by the defense, Moore found that only one was wholly credible and two were partly credible. He did not consider Coles' alleged confessions because of the failure of Davis's lawyers to subpoena Coles, and suggested that Davis should appeal directly to the Supreme Court. In November 2010, the federal appeals panel dismissed an appeal on the case, without ruling on its merits. They stated that Davis should appeal the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court \\"because he had exhausted his other avenues of relief.\\" Rosemary Barkett, one of the panel judges, later released a statement saying that although she agreed with the decision, she still believed that Davis should be given a new trial. Renewed U.S. Supreme Court petition A man protesting the September 21 execution date at the September 17 Occupy Wall Street rally In January 2011, Davis's legal team filed a new petition with the United States Supreme Court, alleging that District Judge Moore had \\"evinced a clear hostility\\" against Davis during the August 2010 hearing, and again asking for a new trial. The petition was rejected without comment by the Supreme Court in March 2011, allowing a new execution date. In May 2011, Amnesty International and People of Faith Against the Death Penalty asked religious leaders to sign a petition to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles calling for the commutation of Davis's death sentence. By September 17, 2011, over 660,000 people had signed the petition for clemency including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Pope Benedict XVI, Archbishop Wilton Gregory, William Sessions (former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), former President Jimmy Carter and representatives for the European Parliament. In contrast, law enforcement officials such as Spencer Lawton, the former Chatham County prosecutor who put Davis on trial, remained convinced of the evidence for Davis's guilt and that Davis's supporters \\"would know differently if they looked at the record.\\" He stated: \\"We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court. We have consistently lost the case as it has been presented in the public realm, on TV and elsewhere.\\" Members of MacPhail's family were also convinced of Davis's guilt, and thought his execution would bring a measure of peace. His mother reported \\"That hole in my heart will be there until the day I die, but it [the execution] may give me some peace and quiet.\\" Mark MacPhail, Jr. stated \\"It's not animosity or anger or rage that has kept us going; that's not what my father would want. It's justice. The law is what he was all about. That's what we have to uphold.\\" Execution of Troy Davis On September 7, 2011, Georgia set Davis's execution date for two weeks later, September 21. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles set a hearing for Davis's second bid for clemency for September 19. This Board had not granted him clemency in September 2008, but the five-member Board now included three new members who had not previously heard the case. On September 20, the Board denied him clemency. On the morning of September 21, the Butts County Superior Court denied Davis's request to halt his execution. The Georgia Supreme Court also denied his appeal. Davis was due to be executed at 7 pm EDT. The same night, Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, announced that President Obama would not intervene in the case (while the president could not have pardoned Davis, he did have the authority to order a federal investigation that might have led to a delay in the execution). Davis filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution. Almost an hour after Davis's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court announced they would review his petition, thereby postponing the execution. The Supreme Court, however, denied Davis's petition, after deliberating for several hours. The execution by lethal injection began at 10:53 pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying: > Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let > you all know, despite the situation – I know all of you are still convinced > that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but > I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did > not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so > sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of > you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the > truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you > all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to > take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08 pm EDT. Twitter recorded 7671 tweets per second in the moments before word of Davis's execution, making his death the second most active Twitter event in 2011. His funeral was attended by more than 1,000 people in Savannah, Georgia, on October 1, 2011.

The series began as a limited series titled WildStar: Sky Zero #1 (March 1993), providing the character's first appearance. This first limited series ran for four issues. The ongoing series WildStar followed the limited series before it was cancelled after 3 issues. Publication history In 1993, the four-issue miniseries WildStar: Sky Zero was written, inked, and edited by Al Gordon. Jerry Ordway penciled the pages between other jobs for DC Comics. Gordon and Ordway found working together difficult because both men wanted more control over the final product, and because they lacked an editor to play middleman.Nolen-Weathington, p. 63 At the same time, they dealt with frustrating trademark issues over the character's name.Nolen-Weathington, p. 63 The series was lettered by John Workman. Erik Larsen's Savage Dragon character made an appearance in the third and fourth issues of the four-issue miniseries. The character WildStar also appeared in a few issues of The Savage Dragon, most recently as SoulStar. The coloring was done by Ruben Rude and Olyoptics. Afterwards, a short-lived ongoing series titled WildStar, was written, inked and edited by Gordon, with Chris Marrinan penciling and John Workman lettering. The coloring of the series was also done by Ruben Rude and Olyoptics. Both series were published by Image Comics and were a part of their second wave. Work began on a second miniseries with Chris Sprouse, including trading cards, pin-ups, and some interior artwork, but the project was abandoned by late 1995. Plot WildStar: Sky Zero The mini series, WildStar: Sky Zero revolves around a time loop that causes a future Micky Gabriel to keep repeating a section of time. In traveling back to the present to escape this endless repetition, Gabriel accidentally sets the time loop in motion. His future self gives the Micky Gabriel of the present the WildStar symbiote, an alien weapon which grants him a variety of superhuman abilities, as well as access to memories of the post-apocalyptic future from which the time displaced Gabriel hails. The original host of the symbiote was BloodStar, a barbaric alien warrior contracted by another alien race, the Ra'Zplarr, to invade the Earth of the future, as part of their quest for a certain \\"special\\" something seemingly endemic to certain Earth occupants. Ongoing series The ongoing series concentrated on the new timeline created during WildStar: Sky Zero, focusing on Micky Gabriel's reluctant association with the WildStar symbiote that contains the memories of a ravaged future Earth. The series reveals more of the devastated Earth's future history. The series was unavoidably canceled after three issues when the comics market was collapsing. HotWire and SkyLark, along with villains JumpStart and Blockade, all from the WildStar: Sky Zero miniseries, appear, as well as Mighty Man from Savage Dragon, and Freak Force. Powers and abilities Micky Gabriel is empowered by the WildStar, a member of a non-sentient species known as the K'l Vann. The WildStar bonds with its host to become a distinct and integral part of the host's metabolism and then by default, it's psychology. It connects directly to the body functions that control glands and other bodily processes that chemically influence behavior. The symbiote then \\"eats\\" the body chemicals that result from the host's negative emotions. The host in turn is powered by the symbiote's alien chemistry resulting in its wearer being granted superhuman strength, the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound, and substantial invulnerability. The symbiote's most devastating weapon in its alien arsenal is a force blast that is discharged by the wearer short- circuiting the symbiote membrane's bio-circuit epidermis.

The ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,042. Baxenden is sometimes known to locals as Bash.  History  Whilst people have inhabited the site for centuries, most of the village dates from the Victorian-Edwardian periods or is more recent. Historically a part of the Blackburn Hundred the first record of Baxenden appears in 1194 as the site of a vaccary subject to Kirkstall Abbey. In the records Baxenden appears under the name Bastanedenecloch likely meaning valley where baking stones are found from the Old English bæc-stan meaning baking stone denu meaning valley (see dale) and clōh meaning ravine (in Northern Middle English clōh evolved into cloghe which has survived in a number of local place names as clough). By 1305 in the records of the de Lacy family the name of Baxenden had evolved to Bakestonden where records show 12s 2d were spent transporting seven loads of lead from Baxenden to Bradford. The lead mine closing as late as 1780. By 1494 the name had evolved to Baxtonden. Local families of historic significance are the Cunliffes of Hollins, Holdens, Hargreaves & Kenyons. Historically farming was the main occupation of the residents of Baxenden. Development of the area began during the Industrial Revolution. The current road through the area was the last road built by Blind Jack Metcalf o' Knaresborough and was completed in 1791 with the old road becoming what is now known as Back Lane and Hollins Lane. It was one of the most challenging roads that he built and he made a loss of £40 on a contract worth £3,500. Alongside this road print works, mills and coal mines developed which led to the need for greater housing in the area and the associated services needed. The surnames Baxendale and Baxenden originate from this village.  Governance  The village is part of the constituency of Hyndburn and is represented in Parliament by the Labour MP Graham Jones. It is represented in Hyndburn borough council by two Conservative councillors. Hyndburn borough council devolves some limited powers and funding to the Baxenden Area Council for resolving minor local issues.  Geography  Baxenden lies south of Accrington on the A680 otherwise known as Manchester Road. It is between 200m at its northern edge and 280m at its southern edge above sea level. It is sited in a wedge shaped valley between Great Hameldon and Oswaldtwistle Moor. Hameldon means scarred hill. Oswaldtwistle Moor is a part of the West Pennine Moors. The valley presumably being carved out by the streams which flow through the area. These streams, Warmden Brook and Woodnook Water, merge beneath Accrington and are tributaries of the River Hyndburn; itself a tributary of the Rivers Calder and then Ribble.  Notable Facts Baxenden ward is site of Haworth Park home to the Haworth Art Gallery. Built in 1909 as Hollins Hill for the prominent local industrialist William Haworth. After the death of his sister Miss Anne Haworth in 1920 she bequeathed it to the town and, in honour, the town named the Gallery for her family. Opened 21 September 1921 the Gallery is home of probably Europe's most significant collection of Tiffany glass chiefly consisting of over one hundred and forty pieces of his Favrile, or ‘hand- made', Glass. The gallery also has a collection of oil paintings and watercolours. Baxenden is probably best known as the home of Holland's Pies. Baxenden is also the home of the chemicals works Baxenden Chemicals. On the night of 6 September 1974, the so-called Black Panther, Donald Neilson, shot the Baxenden sub-postmaster, Derek Astin, at his home, injuring him so that he died soon after arriving at hospital. The Irish republican social campaigner Michael Davitt worked as a child at Stelfoxe's Victoria Mill (later the Victoria and Alliance Mill) in Baxenden. It was here, at the age of eleven, where his arm was lacerated so badly by a spinning machine it had to be amputated; for which he received no compensation.  Transport  Baxenden was once served by Baxenden railway station however this was closed in 1951 before the lines themselves were removed in 1970-71 as recommended by the Beeching Axe. This line was once notorious as one of the most difficult in the country due to its ‘alpine' nature involving a climb from the junction at Stubbins railway station for 5 miles at an average of 1 in 78 to a summit in Baxenden at 771 feet above sea level followed by a 2 and a quarter mile drop down Baxenden Bank, at times as steep as 1 in 38/40. Nowadays ‘the lines' as they are known is a well used footpath which has been recently incorporated into a network of paths that lead throughout the borough. Buses to Rochdale, Bury, Blackburn, Accrington and Manchester pass through Baxenden.  Education  Baxenden has one primary school; St John's Primary built in 1880 to replace a school built in the 1833 sited near the modern junction of Manchester Road with Southwood Drive, and one high school; The Hollins.  Religious sites  There were two churches in Baxenden. St John the Baptist Church founded in 1875, site of the war memorial, and Baxenden Methodist Church, which closed in 2013. The modern vicarage, built in 1977, stands on the site of the old Baxenden House and the Baxenden vaccary of Henry de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract.  Sports  Baxenden Cricket Club, founded around 1868, play in the local cricket league from their grounds off Back Lane. There is a yearly race in the area called the Bash Grueller. Baxenden Golf Club, founded in 1913 a challenging 9 hole course.

He was the only Romani person to be awarded the title People's Artist of the USSR (1981). Biography Nikolai was born in Belgorod area, Russia, in a family of Romani people. Part of his childhood passed during World War II. During the war, Nikolai lost many relatives. In particular, when he was a boy, his father was shot before his eyes in 1942. After the war, the Slichenko family settled at a Romani collective farm in Voronezh Oblast. Teenagers had to work equally with adults. That was the time when Nikolai heard about a Romani theater in Moscow and had dreamt of performing on its stage. In 1951 Nikolai was accepted into the Romen Theatre. The gifted boy drew the attention of the leading theater masters. Certainly, they did not make it easy for him: he began like most, as an auxiliary staff actor. Nikolai was first entrusted with a leading role as long ago as 1952, when he was not yet 18 years old. This was at the time when the theater left to Zagorsk (present-day Sergiev Posad) with the play Four Fiancées by Ivan Khrustalev. Nikolai played the role of Leksa, as a substitute for the actor Sergey Fyodorovich Shishkov (of the Shishkov gypsy dynasty) who had become ill. He then played the role of Leksa for many years, and later, as he grew older, played the role of Badi in this play as well. After the play Slichenko received attention to as a capable actor. The theater began to engage him in the current repertoire plays. In all, at the time he played more than 60 roles in his native theater, and also took part in a number of popular films, including Under the Rain and the Sun, My Island Is Blue, Wedding in Malinovka and others. In 1977, Nikolai Slichenko became the chief director of the Romen Theatre. For this, he completed the Higher Courses for Directors at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in 1972, under the management of the People's Artist of the USSR Andrey Goncharov. On 4 December 1998, a star with Nikolai Slichenko's name was placed at the Star Square in Moscow.

In 1964, Jackson, then working for the Dallas Times Herald, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his photograph of the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby. Early life and career Born on April 8, 1934, Jackson grew up in Dallas. His interest in photography began when he was 12 or 13. An aunt gave him a Baby Brownie Special camera, and a family cat became one of his first subjects. When Jackson turned 14, his interest became more serious. Another aunt gave him an Argus C-3 35 mm camera. Jackson’s first news photo was of a double fatality crash in northern Dallas. Jackson persuaded his father to drive him to the scene of the crash. His second news photo was of an airplane crash at Love Field. Jackson attended Highland Park High School, and later Southern Methodist University, leaving the University in 1957. His photography interest grew when he began photographing sports car racing. He joined the 36th Infantry National Guard. While in the Army, Jackson became a photographer for an Army general. In August 1960, the Dallas Times Herald hired him. November 1963 On November 22, 1963, Jackson was assigned to cover President John F. Kennedy's arrival at Love Field and his motorcade through the city. Jackson and many other journalists traveled with the President and first lady from the airport. He was in the eighth vehicle behind the presidential limousine as the motorcade headed down Elm Street. Jackson was sitting atop the back seat of the convertible as the motorcade approached Dealey Plaza. He was in the process of changing film when the shots were fired; but his camera was empty. He had just removed a roll of film to hand- off to another newspaper employee, and had not yet reloaded. However, he was among the few people who thought that they saw a rifle barrel in the window of the book depository. After the assassination, Jackson remained in Dealey Plaza, but took no more photos, something he later regretted. Two days later, Jackson was told to go to the police station to photograph the transfer of Oswald to the county jail. Using his Nikon S3 35mm camera, Jackson photographed the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby in the Dallas police station garage. In March 1964, Jackson was called to testify in front of the Warren Commission. Later life In later life, Jackson was a staff photographer for the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph. He retired from the Gazette in 1999. He has three daughters, two sons from his wife's previous marriage and a son with his current wife. He also has 10 grandchildren. As of November 2013, Jackson resides in Manitou Springs, Colorado.

He began by studying for the real estate trade then, in 1895, he received his first artistic training from an amateur watercolorist.Konstnären Ivar Arosenius handlingar The following year, he began formal studies at the Valand Academy, where he became friends with the sculptor, Gerhard Henning. He also took lessons at the School of Design and Crafts, in the department of decorative painting. In 1898, he was admitted to the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, where he shared a studio with Henning. Arosenius and his daughter Eva He was, however, dissatisfied with the teaching methods there and switched to the , where he studied with Richard Bergh. After a short time there, he found himself dissatisfied again and returned to the Valand Academy; taking part in an exhibition created by Carl Wilhelmson. In Gothenburg, he collaborated with Henning and Ole Kruse. They were an odd group, because Kruse was a strict moralist whereas Arosenius was more devoted to pleasure. This was partly the result of his having been diagnosed with haemophilia by a doctor who recommended that he consume alcohol to improve his blood's ability to coagulate. Henning often had to serve as a mediator. In 1903, he undertook a study trip to Europe, beginning with Munich. He then went to Paris and spent the summer in the fishing village of Coudeville-sur-Mer in Normandy. In 1905, he was back in Paris, participating in an exhibition of watercolors at the Salon des Indépendants. He later spent some time painting in Torsby.Ivar Arosenius – en minnesbild, av Ernst Spolén, Norstedts Förlag, Stockholm 1963Kvällens violiner, av Ernst Spolén, Boviggens Förlag, Torsby 2007 Portrait of Gerhard Henning He eventually went to Stockholm and had a major showing at the Konstnärshuset.

Later, he decided to move his family to Älvängen, where his mother-in-law owned a small property with a view of the Göta River. They lived in a four room cabin with a studio. In 1908, he made a major breakthrough at Lund University, where he held an exhibition, together with Henning and .

Description Adult males from the Upemba National Park measure and adult females in snout–vent length; the maximum sizes in the original species description were for males and females, respectively. The body and the limbs are moderately slender. The head is pointed with a strongly projecting snout. The tympanum is distinct. The dorsum has three pairs of longitudinal skin folds anteriorly and four to five pairs posteriorly. The finger and toe tips are bluntly rounded. The toes are about two-thirds webbed. The dorsal colouration consists of rows of black, oblong spots and a broad mid-dorsal light band, with a more or less distinct light vertebral line. The tibia have black crossbars. Males have paired vocal sacs and nuptial pads made of cream- colored or dusky velvety c1usters of spinules. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena guibei occurs in moist grassland and savanna; it can be common in dambos. It is generally an upland species, although its range extends to the coast in Mozambique. Breeding takes place in shallow temporary pans and pools where males call from concealed positions close to water. It is a common species that is unlikely to face more than local threats. It is present in the Upemba National Park (Democratic Republic of Congo) and probably in many other protected areas.

Its plan is unusual since the tower is at the end of the south transept. The tower is 13th century and an upper stage was added in the Perpendicular style. However this stage was removed in 1861. (There is now no access to the tower from the transept as the archway between was blocked up at an early date.) Church of St Cuby and St Leonard, Duloe There is a north aisle which continues eastwards to form a chancel aisle which is grander in style (though the arches are lower) and was the family chapel of the Colshull family. There is a fine monument here of Sir John Colshull (d. 1483). The effigy of Sir John in full armour lies on a slab of elvan stone on top of a tomb chest ornamented with shields and at the west end a crucifixion. The parclose screen bears coats of arms connected with the Colshulls and may be made up of parts of a rood screen. Both inside and outside the family chapel is more highly ornamented than the rest of the church. Other monuments commemorate Ann Coffyn (d. 1592), John Killiow (d. 1601) and his wife (a tomb chest), Mary Arundell (d. 1629) with a curious epitaph comparing man to the laurel tree, and Henry Bewes (d. 1793). The Coffyn memorial shows her in Elizabethan dress and is of slate; another slate memorial is to two unknown wives and their children, also shown in Elizabethan dress.

It is endemic to Ethiopia and only known from its type locality at the foothills of the Bale Mountains, in the Bale Mountains National Park. The locality is within the Harenna Forest, and common name Harenna Forest grass frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females, based on a single specimen, in snout–vent length. The head is longer than it is broad. The snout is obtusely pointed. The tympanum is conspicuous. The toes have moderate webbing. The dorsum has four pairs of longitudinal dermal folds, of which the outer pair is prominent, whereas the inner ones are less well- defined, partly broken into clusters of large, rounded warts. Dorsal colouration is cream or pale grey-brown to dark olive-brown. The dorsal skin folds, upper flanks, upper surface of forelimbs, outer edge of hind limbs, upper eyelids, and lips have often suffused to a variable degree with pink, reddish, or purplish pigment, There are dark grey to black markings on the back that vary from being almost obsolete to relatively numerous and prominent, at least dorsolaterally. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena harenna is known from a Podocarpus forest, found amongst herbaceous vegetation on the forest floor, and from a shallow, stagnant pool without aquatic vegetation, next to a fast-flowing river. These are at above sea level. The type locality is within a national park, affording the species some protection. Outside the area, it would suffer from environmental degradation caused by increasing human settlement, with the consequent exploitation of resources, particularly forests.

Description Adult males, based on two specimens only, measure and adult females in snout–vent length. It is the only member of the Ptychadena stenocephala group to have a mid- dorsal skin fold. The legs are relatively long. The shared characteristics of this group are reduced toe webbing, sacral folds on the back, and metatarsal tubercles on the feet. Specifically, one and a half phalanges of the toe V are free of webbing in Ptychadena ingeri. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena ingeri occurs in open and wooded humid savanna in association with marshes and temporary as well as permanent waterbodies, including streams. It presumably breeds in water. Population trends of Ptychadena ingeri are unknown, but it occurs in an area of low human impact and is unlikely to face significant threats.

Gameplay The goal of Diamonds is to achieve a high score while completing as many levels as possible before running out of lives, or ultimately to complete the last level of the game. During the game there is a small ball constantly bouncing up and down on the screen, similar to Breakout. However, unlike the paddle in Breakout, the player can directly control the left and right motion of the ball using the arrow keys on the keyboard. In fact, this is the only control the player has over the game. To complete a level, all blocks with diamond symbols must be cleared away by bouncing the ball against them. However, before the diamond blocks can be destroyed, all solid color blocks must be removed by bouncing the ball off each block while the ball matches the color of the particular block. Among the various types of blocks are \\"brush\\" blocks, which alter the color of the bouncing ball when it makes contact with them, and skull blocks which cost the player one life. When beginning a level or after losing a life, the ball is initially light blue. The player needs to then eliminate all light blue blocks first because there are no light blue brushes to return the ball to that color. Therefore, if the ball's color is changed while light blue blocks remain, the only way to change the ball back to light blue is to intentionally lose a life. Ports In 1993 a port was written for the Apple IIGS by Richard Bennett and Sean Craig, however it sat in limbo due to licensing issues with Varcon Systems. After much delay and failure to have it licensed, it was publicly leaked by beta tester Joe Kohn in 1996. Also in 1993, a clone under the name of Go Bonkers was released for the Sega Genesis as part of the Action 52 multicart by Active Enterprises. Sequels Varcon Systems, Inc. licensed MacSoft to release Diamonds and More Diamonds in 1994. The significant change to this new version was the addition of forty new levels after the original thirty. MacSoft also produced a three-dimensional edition of the game, Diamonds 3D, in 1995. Diamonds 3D received a score of 4 out of 5 from MacUser. Several years afterwards, a pseudo-sequel entitled Diamonds for Kids which featured overall lower difficulty than its predecessor and slight graphical adjustments to accompany a smaller play field was released as part of the compilation disc \\"Kid's Arcade Pack\\" produced by WizardWorks.

The municipality existed from 1907 until its dissolution in 1962. It was located in the north part of what is now the municipality of Inderøy in Trøndelag county. There are two main villages in Sandvollan: Gangstad and Småland. Gangstad has a grocery store. Between the two villages lies Skjelvågen, a harbour that used to be a stop on the steam ship routes. Sandvollan bordered the Sparbu area of the municipality of Steinkjer and the Børgin fjord to the east, the municipality of Inderøy to the southwest, and the Trondheimsfjord to the north. Sandvollan was mostly an agrarian area, though it also functions as a suburb of the town of Steinkjer, located about away. There were two churches in the municipality of Sandvollan: the 12th- century Hustad Church and Heggstad Church from 1887. The older church was built for the chieftain of Hustad, Bård Standale, who was sheriff for Eystein Haraldsson around 1150. The newer church was built because the old one had become too small. History The municipality of Hustad was established on 1 January 1907 when the old municipality of Inderøy was divided into three municipalities: Røra (population: 866) in the southeast, Hustad (population: 732) in the north, and Inderøy (population: 2,976) in the west. In 1912, the name was changed to Sandvollan. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the three neighboring municipalities of Røra (population: 1,003), Sandvollan (population: 750), and Inderøy (population: 3,194) to form a new, larger municipality of Inderøy. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Sandvollan, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. Municipal council The municipal council of Sandvollan was made up of 13 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

These frogs can swim fairly well, jump far and can crawl with ease through dense plants. Their strong hindlegs can launch them up to three metres into the air in a single bound. Taxonomy Named after Mozambique where the species was first identified. Conservation status Not threatened. Description Length: 45–50 mm, maximum 53 mm Body Internarial distance greater than snout-nostril distance. Above Dark grey-brown to chocolate brown or green. A broad creamy to orange-brown vertebral band from snout to vent, bordered by elongated blackish spots. Snout without prominent pale triangle, not paler than rest of body. 6 or more dorsolateral skin ridges prominent, continuous only as far as the hump of the back and creamy-white. Dark brown blotches, smaller than eye, between vertebral bands and dorsolateral ridges. Tympanum Prominent. Slightly smaller than eye. Underside Creamy-white, sometimes with grey mottling along lower jaw on throat and on hind part of abdomen. Thighs and groin often pale yellow. Skin smooth. Forelimbs Arm comparatively short. Hindlimbs Foot shorter than tibia. There is a pale line sometimes present along the upper surface of the tibia. Back of thigh dark grey, with yellow mottling sometimes forming irregular lines. Webbing moderate. 2,75 to 3 phalanges of fourth toe and one phalanx of fifth toe free of webbing. Tarsal fold present. Inner and outer metatarsal tubercles present. Row of tubercles under fourth toe. Sexual dimorphism Gular slits in male not parallel to jaw-line on lateral view. Key identification points * Back of thighs with yellow mottling, sometimes forming irregular lines (distinct from P. subpunctata, P. taenioscelis and P. guibei). * Internarial distance greater than snout-nostril distance (distinct from other species except P. guibei, P. mapacha and P. schillukorum). * Length of foot less than tibia length (distinct from P. guibei, P. mascareniensis, P. subpunctata and P. taenioscelis). * Pale line on tibia sometimes present (distinct from P. anchietae, P. oxyrhychus, P. schillukorum and P. taenioscelis, although sometimes present also in P. subpunctata). * Outer metatarsal tubercle present (distinct from other species except P. guibei, P. mapacha and P. schillukorum). * Broad pale band extends from rump to snout but snout not paler than the rest of the body (distinct from P. anchietae, P. oxyrhynchus, P. schillukorum and P. subpunctata). * Mottling on the back of the thighs is irregular with no discernable pattern. Similar species This species is smaller than most other Ptychadena species. It is similar to the Sharp-nosed Grass Frog (P. oxyrhynchus). It is less conspicuous than the Plain Grass Frog (P. anchietae) and hides by day, calling from concealed positions. Previously considered a race of the Mascarene Grass Frog (Rana mascarenienis mossambica Loveridge); the length from the heel to the toes in P. mascareniensis is greater than the length of the tibia. The Dwarf Grass Frog (P. taenioscelis) is smaller (less than 35 mm), with stripes down the backside of the thighs. Distribution It is found in South Africa from northern Zululand through the Lowveld and Kruger National Park northwards to Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and possibly Angola. Best viewing: Kruger-Lowveld (South Africa), Okavango (Botswana), Tshaneni (Swaziland). Call The call of these frog is a series of harsh nasal kwe-kwe or wah-wah-wah clucks, repeated at the rate of two per second, much like the quacking of the Egyptian Goose. Males call from concealed positions in grass tussocks at the edge of water on shores of marshes and pans or even several metres away from water. Until vegetation establishes itself after winter, males may call along the water's edge in completely exposed positions. Calling peakings after dark till about midnight. Habitat Its natural habitats is flooded grass and rush around intermittent (pans) and permanent freshwater marshes (vleis), ponds or streams in a variety of bushveld vegetation types at altitudes of 200 to 1 200 m in dry savanna, thicket and subtropical or tropical dry and seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, but also moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical dry and moist shrubland, swamps, intermittent freshwater lakes, arable land, pastureland and water storage areas. Habits When the pools in its preferred habitats dry up, the frogs often seek refuge in deep cracks and crevices in the underlying mud that is busy drying. Here they often spend the dry winter months, and become active after the first spring rains. When disturbed, it jumps away from the water to vegetation, crawls beneath it and is concealed. Reproduction In the Kruger National Park 315 eggs were collected from a single female. Each egg is 1,2 mm in diameter and surrounded by a transparent jelly about 3 mm in diameter. The eggs sink to the bottom. The animal pole of the egg is a dark grey-brown while the vegetable pole is a creamy yellow-white. The eggs develop very quickly. Tadpole Unknown.

It is endemic to Ethiopia. It is only known with certainty from its type locality, Arussi Mountains, in the Ethiopian Highlands; these mountains are also referred to as the Arsi Mountains. There is uncertainty regarding reports from elsewhere (in particular, Bale Mountains), which perhaps refer to other, possibly undescribed species. Freilich and colleagues found specimens from the Bale Mountains to be larger than \\"normal\\" Ptychadena nana, but that molecular data clustered them with other P. nana. Common names Somali grassland frog and smallest grass frog have been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length, or respectively and , according to Freilich and colleagues. The tympanum is distinct. The hindlimbs are relatively short. Skin folds on the back incomplete, often more or less extensively and irregularly fragmented. The toes are slightly webbed. Adult males have external vocal sacs. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena nana is a mountain grassland species that occurs at elevations of or above sea level, depending on the source. It has been reported as locally abundant and being found near streams, in cattle grazing fields and in mosaics of cropland and other natural vegetation, and in roadside pools in rural towns and villages. In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Ptychadena nana is listed as \\"endangered\\" because of its small known range and threats to its habitat. It is not known to occur in any protected areas.

Heed (Kashmir Singh Heed) (born November 1955) is a Canadian former politician, who was elected as a BC Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2009 provincial election, representing the riding of Vancouver-Fraserview. He formerly served as the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. He was formerly chief constable of the West Vancouver Police Department and a former superintendent with the Vancouver Police Department and was the first Indo-Canadian police chief in Canada.  Policing  Heed graduated from the B.C. Police Academy in 1979 and began his career as an officer with the VPD. In June 2007 he lost out to Deputy Chief Jim Chu for the position of Chief Constable of the VPD, but days later was appointed to that title in West Vancouver. He led the West Vancouver Police Department for 19 months and resigned on February 23, 2009. He was the superintendent in charge of the south part of Vancouver, and as an Inspector was commander of District 3, which corresponds to the southeast quadrant of Vancouver. Other roles in his career with the VPD have included heading the drug squad and Indo-Canadian gang task force, as well as implementing the department's COMPSTAT information technology system. He is a published author who also teaches criminology and criminal justice at two B.C. colleges. He pioneered initiatives aimed at crime reduction and prevention as well as greater community and police engagement. He led the Indo-Canadian Task Force and inspired the formation of grassroots organizations dedicated to preventing gang violence.  Politics Heed was appointed to the B.C. cabinet as Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General on June 10, 2009. His responsibilities under this portfolio included crime prevention, law enforcement, victim services, road safety and emergency preparedness.

It is known from Macenta and Sérédou in Guinea, Sukurela in Sierra Leone, and Mount Nimba (its type locality) in Liberia and Ivory Coast. Description of Ptychadena pujoli is based on old museum specimens, and very little is known about the ecology of this relatively recently (1997) described species. Taxonomy Before Ptychadena pujoli was described in 1997, it was mistakenly reported as Ptychadena bibroni (Hallowell, 1845); this was caused by a mistake in the original species description by Edward Hallowell. Ptychadena pujoli belongs to the so-called \\"Ptychadena stenocephala group\\", characterized by little webbing in the feet and by having sacral folds on the dorsum and tubercles on the feet. The other species in this group are Ptychadena arnei, Ptychadena ingeri, and Ptychadena tournieri; Ptychadena pujoli is most similar to Ptychadena tournieri. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length; it is the largest species in the Ptychadena stenocephala group. The legs are relatively long. The webbing in feet leaves two phalanges of toe V free (only one in P. tournieri). Median dorsal fold is absent. Habitat and conservation Habitat requirements of this species are poorly known, but it has been found in swamps in savanna and grassland in hilly areas. Presumably it breeds in temporary pools, as other species in the genus. Population trends of Ptychadena pujoli and threats to it are unknown. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as \\"Data Deficient\\".

Though born in New York, he has been based in Southern California throughout his ongoing career as a session musician and songwriter. Early career Biondo played bass in a Los Angeles area band called Storybook People during which time they released a single on Dunhill Records, which received limited airplay in Los Angeles. In 1968, Biondo replaced Nick St. Nicholas in another Los Angeles area band called T.I.M.E., when St. Nicholas departed for Steppenwolf. After T.I.M.E. guitarist Larry Byrom also left to join Steppenwolf, T.I.M.E. briefly attempted to carry on with Biondo as lead singer, but never released any further recordings. Steppenwolf In early 1970, Biondo replaced St. Nicholas a second time when he joined Steppenwolf for the recording of Steppenwolf 7, contributing lead vocals on \\"Fat Jack\\" and co-lead vocals on \\"Foggy Mental Breakdown\\" and the chart-hit, \\"Who Needs Ya'\\". In 1971, the band released their last new album for Dunhill, For Ladies Only for which Biondo wrote \\"Sparkle Eyes\\" with John Kay and \\"In Hopes of a Garden\\". He sang lead on the latter, as well as \\"Jaded Strumpet\\". When Steppenwolf went on hiatus in 1972, Biondo became a founding member of the John Kay Band, appearing on both of Kay's solo albums on Dunhill Records. When Steppenwolf reconvened in the mid-1970s, Biondo was brought back for the album Slow Flux. Then writing \\"Two for the Love of One\\" for the Hour of the Wolf album. Biondo later wrote \\"Sleep\\" and co-wrote the instrumental \\"Lip Service\\" with Bobby Cochran and Wayne Cook for the Skullduggery album in 1976. In 1981, Biondo added backing vocals to Wolftracks, the first studio album by John Kay and his new band, now under the moniker John Kay & Steppenwolf. After Steppenwolf In 1980, Biondo reunited with Steppenwolf cofounder Jerry Edmonton in a band called Steel Rose. A Steel Rose single penned by Biondo, \\"Good That You're Gone\\", was released on Dore Records, and featured Biondo on lead vocals. When Steel Rose disbanded in 1984, Biondo returned to writing and freelance club and session work.

It is a widespread species in West Africa and found in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, as well as in Togo and Benin; it is assumed to occur in Ghana and southeastern Burkina Faso, although it has not been recorded there. On the other hand, some records may refer to other species; the Amphibian Species of the World excludes Gambia and Togo from the distribution. Common names Liberia grassland frog and Tournier's rocket frog are sometimes used. Etymology The specific name tournieri refers to Jean- Luc Tournier, who was director of the Institut Français d’Afrique Noire in Abidjan (now Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire). Description Adult males measure and females in snout–vent length. The webbing in feet leaves one phalanx of toe V free (two in P. pujoli). The head is slightly longer than wide and with a pointed snout. The tympanum is almost as large as the eye. The dorsum has two pairs of dorsal ridges, with granulated skin in between, and a pair of dorsolateral ridges. Fine ridges are present also on the thighs and shanks. The upper lip is white. There are dark canthal lines that run from beyond the tympanum to the flanks, becoming somewhat thinner posteriorly. The dorsal ridges are white to light red whereas the dorsolateral ridges are white. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena tournieri inhabits humid savanna areas, and can also survive altered habitats such as rice paddies. Reproduction takes place in small, stagnant and shallow temporary waters as well as in flooded fields and pans. This adaptable species is not considered to face significant threats.

Its common name is Dakar grassland frog. It is widely distributed in West and Middle Africa, and following the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), occurs in Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo. Further, records are missing from Guinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso, Niger, South Sudan, and Sudan, but it is presumed to be present in these countries too. Description Ptychadena trinodis is a relatively large frog with a pointed head. Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Males have paired lateral vocal sacs. The tympanum is large and distinct. There are three pairs of continuous dorsal ridges that start at the level of the eyes, and a shorter, median pair. The hind legs are sturdy and of moderate length. The inner metatarsal tubercle is massive, almost as long as the shortest toe. The colouration is generally brownish or grayish, with black or dark brown spots present on dorsal ridges, flanks, and the dorsum. Habitat, ecology, and conservation Its natural habitats are both dry and humid savannas, with a preference for the former. Breeding takes place in very small, temporary ponds and seems to commence at once when the rainy season starts and may continue through the rainy season. The eggs hatch to tadpoles in a day and metamorphose in three weeks. Ptychadena trinodis has a patchy distribution and a low population density. In northern Benin, however, it was found to be common after the first rains of the season. It is an adaptable species that is not facing any significant threats. It also occurs in many protected areas, including the Garamba National Park; the IUCN has assessed Ptychadena trinodis as of \\"Least Concern\\".

It is endemic to Ethiopia and only known from a small area southeast of Lake Tana, in the upper reaches of the Blue Nile. The specific name wadei honours Edward O.Z. Wade, an English illustrator and herpetology enthusiast who drew some of the illustrations accompanying the species description. Common name Wade's grass frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure in snout–vent length. The type series does not include adult females; the largest, still immature female was . The head is longer than it is broad; the snout is moderately pointed. The tympanum is conspicuous. The toes are moderately webbed. The hindlimbs are relatively short. The dorsum has five pairs of longitudinal skin folds that are nearly complete. A pale vertebral stripe extends from the tip of the snout to the supra-anal region; some individuals have also a weak, even paler vertebral stripe. There are numerous small dark brown blotches arranged in rows along the skin folds, except for the outermost ones. A dark streak passes from snout tip through the eye and the tympanum, ending behind the forelimb insertion. The upper lip and infra- tympanic ridge are pale. The tibia have 2–5 transverse bars, often narrowly interrupted by a tibial line. The venter is immaculate, cream. Males have bicoloured vocal sacs. Habitat and conservation Ptychadena wadei is known from montane grassland and shrubland at elevations of above sea level. Breeding takes place in temporary pools and streamlets. Threats to this species are poorly known, but it is likely to be affected by habitat degradation, primarily caused by agricultural development, expanding human settlements, and overgrazing by livestock. It is not known to occur in any protected area.

It is also known as the pixie frog due to its scientific name. It is found in Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and possibly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has long been confused with the edible bullfrog (P. adspersus) and species boundaries between them, including exact range limits, are not fully understood. Additionally, P. angusticeps of coastal East Africa only was revalidated as a separate species in 2013. The natural habitats of the African bullfrog are dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, intermittent freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, pastureland, canals, and ditches. It is among the largest frogs, with males weighing up to . Females are half the size of males, which is unusual since in most amphibian species females are larger than males, to help the amplexus. Males can reach in snout–to–vent length, while females are much smaller. Feeding and habits The African bullfrog is a voracious carnivore, eating insects, small rodents, reptiles, small birds, and other amphibians. It is also a cannibalistic species—the male African bullfrog is known for occasionally eating the tadpoles he guards. An African bullfrog kept at the Pretoria Zoo in South Africa once ate 17 Juvenile Rinkhals Snakes (Hemachatus haemachatus). They emit a loud croaking and a bleating sound when stressed or handled. It is one of the three frog species regularly kept in captivity that have sharp teeth and willingly bite humans when provoked or handled; the other two are Pacman frogs and Budgett's frogs. Reproduction Breeding starts after heavy rain (initiated by about of rain over the course of two days). They breed in shallow, temporary water bodies, such as pools, pans, and ditches. Eggs are laid in the shallow edge of the pond, but fertilization takes place above water. The African bullfrog males call out during the rainy season. The call lasts about a second and can be described as a low-pitched whoop. Males have two breeding strategies, depending on their age. Young males congregate in a small area, perhaps only of shallow water. The larger males occupy the center of these breeding arenas or leks and attempt to chase off other males. Often, they fight, causing injury or even killing one another. The dominant male attempts to prevent other males from breeding. A female approaches the group of males by swimming along at the surface until she is within a few meters of the group. Then the female dives to avoid the smaller males and surfaces in the defended area of a larger male in the middle of the group. This helps to ensure that she mates with the dominant male. The female lays about 3,000 to 4,000 eggs at a time. The tadpoles hatch and after two days start feeding on vegetation, small fish, invertebrates, and even each other. Defending males continue to watch over the tadpoles, which metamorphose within three weeks. During the tadpole's development, the father guards his young. Due to the male bullfrog's overprotective behavior, he pounces and bites anything that he views as a threat. If the pool is in danger of drying out, the father uses his legs and head to dig a canal from the drying pond to a bigger pond. He continues to guard the tadpoles until they are old enough to fend for themselves, although he may also eat some of them. Pet trade The African bullfrog is an exotic pet in many countries around the world. Animals sold are generally bred in captivity. It is not unusual for pet African bullfrogs to live for 35 years in captivity.

Description The edible bullfrog is a large bodied frog in which the males typically reach in snout–to–vent length and the females . Exceptionally large males may even reach , although the species does not approach the sizes attained by the related African bullfrog (P. adspersus). The females of the edible bullfrog are much less bulky than the males and typically reach just half of the weight of the males. There are two tooth like structures in the lower jaw of the broad mouth bears which point upwards. The skin of the edible bullfrog has slight, rather rounded warts. It has short lateral ridges which never stretch all the way from the head to the end of the body, their form changes considerably as the frog grows. The young frogs are quite sturdy and look almost plump but the adults show dorsoventral flattening. As the frogs grow their eyes become more centrally placed, and the eyes of adults are very protruding. They show a distinct tympanum, which is large and oval in shape. The front feet are unwebbed but the hind feet are webbed. The backs of adult animals is more or less uniform yellow green to drab olive green with the males tending to be greener than the more olive brown females. The females may show a pale stripe along the backbone, light lines on the ridges and warts, these are less common in males. The newly metamorphosed young often have a bright, light green stripe along the middle of the back, with gold-brown speckles and black markings on their dark green skin and the lips and extremities where they form black bars. The lower half of the body is uniformly white or cream, although the male has a dark yellow throat. Voice A short, deep \\"whoop\\" call which lasts from 0.11 to 0.29 sec, and is made at irregular intervals. Distribution The edible bullfrog is found in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chad, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe; but there is some confusion due to misidentification with similar closely related species such as African bullfrog Pyxicephalus adspersus. Habitat Flooded grasslands, in northern Cameroon it seems to prefer open marshy areas. While elsewhere flooded meadows and ditches are recorded. Edible bullfrogs show a preference for clay or sand substrates. Biology The edible bullfrog spends approximately 10 months of the year in aestivation beneath the surface of the soil, only emerging to breed in numbers if sufficiently heavy rain, i.e. more than , falls within a short period. After which male edible bullfrogs call on the flooded grassland and from any small, temporary pools such as included roadside ditches, shallow excavations where the water is shallow, less than in depth and had flooded vegetation. Breeding appears to occur during the day and breeding activity and calling had decreased substantially by midday. The males gathered in loose groups in the shallow water, each congregation centred on a dominant male which charged at, bit and tossed any other males that approached too closely. Some males, however, would head straight for the dominant male. These aggressive bouts often caused serious injuries and there were even some that ended in the death of one of the combatants. The females move freely within and between these male gatherings with the males pursuing them. Courtship is simple and the female begins laying soon after amplexus commences. Once paired, the other frogs did not generally disturb by other frogs, but displacement of the male from the female by another male has been recorded. The spawn is laid in shallow water. Males call from shallow water lying in the water with their heads and vocal sacs above the surface, their deep calls causing a rippling effect in the water, calling decreases as the day progressed and, if the rain is short-lived the frog will cease calling quite quickly. The diet consists of insects including Coleoptera which were found in 100% of stomach contents sampled, as were Orthoptera while Isoptera, Diplopoda, Hymenoptera and spiders were also recorded. Some vegetation was also recorded but this is assumed to have been swallowed accidentally when capturing animal prey. The aggregation of breeding frogs attracts several bird predators and these have included yellow-billed kite Milvus aegyptius, marabou stork Leptoptilos crumeniferus, saddle-billed stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis, intermediate egret Mesophoyx intermedia, grey heron Ardea cinerea and black-headed heron Ardea melanocephala. Some edible bullfrogs were seen to lunge at water birds that got too close, possibly these were males aggressively defending their territories. After spawning the males guard the tadpoles and may dig channels for them if their natal pool is drying out too quickly. Human use Edible bullfrogs are locally, widely used for human consumption, although not at a subsistence level. It is occasionally found in the international pet trade. Conservation A major threat to the populations of edible bullfrogs in most of its range is collection of frogs for local consumption. Edible bullfrogs are sometimes also found in the international pet trade but at levels that are low enough that they do not constitute a major threat to the species. In some areas, e.g. western Tanzania, habitat loss such as the conversion of miombo to agricultural land may combine with over exploitation to reduce populations.

The most famous of these was a trip of 2,400 km from Canton to Peking in 1655-1657, which enabled him to become an authoritative Western writer on China. He wrote An embassy from the East-India Company containing the written account of this journey. Biography Johan Nieuhof was born in Uelsen, a town in the county of Bentheim, Lower Saxony, sitting just across the Dutch-German border. His father (originally from Zwolle) was mayor of the town, and was later succeeded by one of Johan's brothers and brother-in-law. By the grace of Cornelis Jan Witsen, a leading figure within the Dutch West India Company (or \\"WIC\\"), Nieuhof left for Dutch Brazil in 1640 as a reserve officer-candidate. From then on, barring two short family visits in 1658 and 1671, he spent all the rest of his life abroad. Nieuhof was employed in Brazil to explore the regions between Maranhão and the São Francisco Rivers, made a particular study of the neighborhood of Pernambuco. He left Brazil in 1649, after the Portuguese victory in the Second Battle of Guararapes. Upon his return, Nieuhof joined the service of the Dutch East India Company (or \\"VOC\\"). In service of the VOC he resided several years in Batavia, and then was appointed in 1654 steward of an embassy to the relatively new Qing emperor China under Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyser, which aimed to gain trading rights on China's southern coast. He remained in China until 1657. In 1663 he operated as an ambassador in Quilon, after the occupation of the Malabar Coast by Rijckloff van Goens.Wouter Schouten (1676) Oost-Indische voyagie; vervattende veel voorname voorvallen en ongemeene oreemde geschiedenissen, bloedige zee- en landtgevechten tegen de Portugeesen en Makassaren, p. 201, 310. During this period he visited several chiefs of indigenous tribes in order to secure trade relations with them. Afterwards, he was offered a post on Ceylon where he was stationed between 1663 and 1667. He was imprisoned for seven months because of illegal trade in pearls.Heniger, J. (1986) Hendrik Adriaan van Reede tot Drakenstein (1636--1691) and Hortus Malabaricus -- A contribution to the history of Dutch colonial botany, p. 22. Nieuhof was sent to Batavia by Hendrik van Rheede and fired by the Dutch East India Company. On returning to the Indies from a trip home in 1672, he stopped on the isle of Madagascar. On October 8 1672, Nieuhof traveled inland along with the first mate, in search of the local tribes in order to trade with them, as well as secure water for his crew. Upon hearing several gunshots, the captain sent a second ship towards the island in order to await Nieuhof's return. After three days of waiting, the captain presumed Nieuhof and his company to be murdered and sailed onwards towards Mauritius. On order of the governing council in Amsterdam, a ship was sent from the Cape of Good Hope to retrieve Nieuhof and his fellows, but no trace of them could be found. China memoirs The \\"Old Viceroy\\" of Guangdong, Shang Kexi, probably drawn by Johan Nieuhoff himself in Guangzhou in 1655. In the first half of the 17th century, the VOC tried to break the Portuguese monopoly position on trade to Macau. When they did not succeed, they sent six embassies to Peking between 1655 and 1685. Their aim was to convince the Qing emperor to open up trade relations on the southern coast, in favor of the VOC, although they ultimately failed. Nieuhof was appointed to the position of steward on one of these embassies by Joan Maetsuycker, which traveled from Canton to Peking between 1655 and 1658. They were the second embassy to try and gain the emperor's favor, the first was led by Zacharias Wagenaer. Nieuhof's duties as part of the embassy primarily consisted of ceremonial matters as well as securing lodgings. He was, however, specifically appointed to illustrate any and all of the cities, palaces, temples, rivers and other noteworthy buildings in their true to nature form. On March 17 1656, after months of negotiations and discussions of tributes to be paid to the Chinese emperor and viceroy, the embassy left Canton by barge, to travel towards Peking. The embassy arrived at the emperor's court in Peking on July 18 the same year. The hired the jesuit scholar Johann Adam Schall von Bell to be their translator, who warned them of the possible dangers and required ceremonies to approach the emperor. On September 24, the embassy was received by the Shunzhi Emperor. As dictated by their translator, the party performed the traditional kowtow, as failing to do so would most likely result in immediate refusal by the emperor. As a result, the emperor allowed Dutch embassies to visit the court once every eight years, in parties consisting of no more than 100 men. Any trading rights were not discussed nor granted at this point. On October 16 the embassy was asked to leave the city of Peking within two hours. Their return trip took three months; putting the entire length of the embassy at 20 months and 6 days. At his homecoming in 1658, he had entrusted his notes and annotations to his brother Hendrik, whom Johan thanked when finally (in 1665) Hendrik produced an ample study of China, with many images, text and explanation of the latest events. The work was published by Jacob van Meurs in 1665, titled Het Gezandtschap der Neêrlandtsche Oost- Indische Compagnie, aan den grooten Tartarischen Cham, den tegenwoordigen Keizer van China: Waarin de gedenkwaerdigste Geschiedenissen, die onder het reizen door de Sineesche landtschappen, Quantung, Kiangsi, Nanking, Xantung en Peking, en aan het Keizerlijke Hof te Peking, sedert den jaren 1655 tot 1657 zijn voorgevallen, op het bondigste verhandelt worden. Beneffens een Naukeurige Beschrijvinge der Sineesche Steden, Dorpen, Regeering, Weetenschappen, Hantwerken, Zeden, Godsdiensten, Gebouwen, Drachten, Schepen, Bergen, Gewassen, Dieren, et cetera en oorlogen tegen de Tartar : verçiert men over de 150 afbeeltsels, na't leven in Sina getekent. Hendrik dedicated the work to Hendrik Spiegel and Cornelis Jan Witsen (Nicolaes Witsen's father), administrators of the East and West India Companies respectively. Translations into French (1665), German (1666), Latin (1668) and English (1669) were also published, each going into at least two editions. More of Nieuhoff's material, on Chinese ships, appeared in Nicolaes Witsen's \\"Scheepsbouw\\" (1671). The reports from these embassies and the reports of the Jesuits formed the only reliable source of information on China available in Western Europe. As mentioned, being the purser of the VOC embassy to Peking, Johan Nieuhof in 1655 had special instructions to observe all \\"farms, towns, palaces, rivers, ... [and other] buildings\\" that he might pass by, drawing them \\"in straight form and figure\\", as well as remains of the historical victory of the \\"Tartars\\" (Manchus) that brought an end to the reign of the Ming dynasty. The inclusion of approximately 150 illustrations in the book marked the first time that literature on China contained images that were true to nature. In previously published works, belonging to the imaginitive 'fantastic tradition' where fact and fiction were hardly discernible, the Chinese were depicted as creatures of fantasy. Nieuhof's illustrations, as opposed to these previous works, depicted the Chinese and their culture as they were obvserved by the illustrator himself, without fanciful additions. The 150 illustrations of the Nieuhoffs' book were one inspiration for chinoiserie, which became especially popular in the 18th century. Many artists and architects based their designs on the pictures in the book. The original drawings were rediscovered in 1984 in the collection of prince Roland Bonaparte, an anthropologist who collected material about Madagascar, Lapland and the Native Americans.

Partner: Radel * Cassandra : Cassandra grew up in an orphanage. There she met Oni Inomura and the two became close. They realized that they both possess strange powers and see each other as siblings. They were forced to leave the orphanage after Oni burned it down. After leaving the orphanage they begin to travel. During their travels, Oni is compelled to fight. It is an urge that he cannot ignore. During one of these fights, Oni is severely wounded, leaving Cassandra to find help for him. With Oni wounded, Cassandra seeks out Elias Patrick for help.

Development and release  Evoga originally envisioned Rage of the Dragons as a sequel to the Neo Geo fighting game version of Double Dragon released in 1995. However, Evoga were unable to use the intellectual rights for the characters (which were purchased by the company founded by former Technos Japan staff Million, the developers of Double Dragon Advance), and thus Rage of the Dragons was turned into a homage to the Double Dragon series instead of an official sequel. The two lead characters in Rage of the Dragons, Billy and Jimmy Lewis, share their names with the protagonists of the Double Dragon series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, while Kang is based on Burnov from Double Dragon II: The Revenge, and the boss character Abubo is based on Abobo from the original Double Dragon. Two supporting characters in Rage, Linda (Abubo's female assistant) and Mariah (Jimmy's girlfriend), are also based on Double Dragon characters. Jimmy, Lynn, Elias and Mr. Jones would later appear as hidden guest characters in Matrimelee, a fighting game also produced by Noise Factory. Coincidentally, Atlus, the company that originally produced the Power Instinct series, published Double Dragon Advance for Million. The game was co-designed by Mario Vargas and Eduardo d' Palma, who would later work in the anime industry. The soundtrack was composed by Toshikazu Tanaka, who was previously employed at SNK and worked on project such as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters.  Reception  Spanish magazine Gametype gave Rage of the Dragons a positive outlook. Monthly Arcadia reported on their September 2002 issue that the game was the six most popular release in Japan. Double Dragon creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto stated he had \\"nothing to do with Rage of the Dragons\\". In 2012, Complex ranked this \\"sequel to the first Double Dragon fighting game\\" as the 13th best SNK fighting game ever made. Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 regarded the game as \\"an excellent game for anyone into late era 2D fighters, and doubly so for its rad character designs and awesome soundtrack\\".

In December 1972 he took a three-shot lead entering the final round of the South African Masters after shooting a third- round 64 (−6). However he would slip up in the final round and Gary Player would surpass him. Later in the season, at the Western Province Open, he once again held the lead entering the final round but shot a disappointing 75 (+2) to lose to South Africa's Hugh Baiocchi by one. Two seasons later, in February 1975, O'Leary finished in third place at the South African Open, the country's most prestigious event, behind Gary Player. The next week he finally won, winning the Holiday Inns Royal Swazi Sun Open, an official event on the South African Tour which is played in Swaziland. He shot 271 (−17) to defeat South Africans Dale Hayes and John Fourie by four shots. Later in 1975, back in Europe, he picked up a runner-up finish at the Open de France, tying for second with fellow Irishman Eamonn Darcy and in May, playing with Jack Newton, he won the Sumrie-Bournemouth Better-Ball. Also in February 1975, while he was in South Africa, O'Leary received a £500 fine and a one-year ban from representing any PGA team, a ban that would have ruled him out of the 1975 Ryder Cup. The ban followed complaints about his conduct in an event in Jamaica in late 1974. O'Leary appealed and the one-year ban was lifted, although the £500 fine stood. Eight members of the Great Britain and Ireland team for the 1975 Ryder Cup were chosen from the money leaders in 1975 European Tour events after the Benson & Hedges Festival on 16 August, with the remaining four members of the 12-man team selected by a committee. His performance in the Open de France, as well as three other top-10 performances, were enough for O'Leary to finish 6th among the automatic qualifiers and gain a place on the team. O'Leary played four matches in the Ryder Cup, losing all four. The next season produced O'Leary's first European Tour win, the Greater Manchester Open. Like his first official win, it was a four-shot victory over South Africa's John Fourie. He finished a career-best 16th on that year's European Tour Order of Merit. Afterwards, O'Leary played solidly but did not move into the upper echelon of European players. He finished in the top 60 on the Order of Merit every season through 1987 but never the top 15. The highlight during this part of his career was undoubtedly at the 1982 Carroll's Irish Open. In difficult conditions at Portmarnock, he defeated English veteran Maurice Bembridge by one shot. This avenged a one-shot defeat to Ken Brown in 1978. He was only the third Irishman to win his national open and he was the last one to win for 25 years, Pádraig Harrington being victorious in 2007. During the 1988 and 1989 seasons, O'Leary did not come close to making the top 100 of the Order of Merit. He retired as a touring professional after the 1989 season. From 1985 O'Leary served as one of the directors of the European Tour, leaving the position in 2019. He had also been on the Ryder Cup committee and had been head professional at Buckinghamshire Golf Club. Death Following a long illness, O'Leary died in Esher, Surrey, United Kingdom on 26 March 2020, aged 70.

Found on the mainland of Italy and the Mediterranean islands of Sicily, Elba, Corsica and Sardinia, its natural habitats are rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and freshwater marshes. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Description The Italian pool frog grows to a snout-to-vent length of about and has a pointed snout and triangular-shaped head. The tongue is notched and it has vomerine teeth in the roof of its mouth. The skin is smooth and not warty. The colour is variable and depends on the animal's location, but is usually some shade of green with black spots, but may be reddish-brown or grey. There is a pale stripe running along the centre of the back. The underparts are greyish-white marked with dark blotches and the hind legs have dark stripes. Males have a pair of external vocal sacs on either side of the mouth which are only visible when the animal is calling. The voice is a series of guttural croaks each lasting up to one and a half seconds. Distribution and habitat The Italian pool frog is native to the mainland of Italy, south of Rimini and Genoa, and to the islands of Sicily, Elba and Corsica. It has been introduced into Sardinia. Its typical habitat is sluggish streams and rivers, lakes and swamps and their environs, and it is present at altitudes of or more. It has been introduced into the United Kingdom but whether it persists there is unclear. Status The main threat to the Italian pool frog is the draining of its aquatic habitats; as a result of this, the population appears to be declining at a slow rate. However, the frog has a wide range, is common in many places and has a large total population, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of \\"least concern\\".

It was born during the 90s as a music bar and began with a license for just 80 people, opened by two Spanish brothers, Deogracias lara Moreno and Antonio Lara Moreno. In 1999, two Italian promoters; Antonio Carbonaro and Andrea Pelino, joined in force, creating during the same year the Circoloco brand, which would soon become the iconic event of DC10 and would then begin its residency each Monday during each Ibiza season. Throughout the years, the four entrepreneurs have grown DC10 to such a level, that it has now become a reference point for the world of what the Ibiza music scene has to offer. With a series of investments throughout the years, they have changed the structure of the nightclub to make it a space that holds a capacity of 4000 people, which is broken down into three distinct rooms; La Terrace, The Main Room and The Open Air Garden, each of which has been divided by musical genre. The work of the group of entrepreneurs has also led to a substantial modification of the license which now goes from a music bar to an event hall. History  Inauguration and early years (1999–2000s)  The infamous Circoloco parties first started in July 1999. In their original format, sessions began at 6 am, as Space's 24-hour Sunday session ended. Italian promoters Andrea and Antonio programmed using a roster of non-mainstream European DJs, and as awareness of the party developed, artists such as Danny Tenaglia, Sasha, Steve Lawler and Pete Tong were offering to play the club for free. The old logo, showing the hangar theme of the club The open top floor of the club in 2007 By the 2002 season, the club's reputation had been documented by the international dance music press. The club's reputation grew rapidly along with the resurgence of the popularity of the minimal techno genre, with many of the club's residents at the forefront of this, including Tania Vulcano, Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Cirillo, Loco Dice, Jose De Divina and later, the Romanian trio Arpiar, Zip, Matthias Tanzmann, Jamie Jones, Clive Henry, Dan Ghenacia, Sossa, Damian Lazarus, Andrew Grant & System of Survival. The club also attracted high-profile regular guests such as Richie Hawtin, Josh Wink, Magda and Dinky. At its height, it was arguably responsible for the wider birth of the European minimal techno sound that became dominant in the second half of the decade. The club's popularity also rested on its perceived existence outside the established group of Ibiza \\"superclubs\\", such as Space, Amnesia, Privilege Ibiza, and Pacha. The underground spirit of Circoloco meant that it did not conform to the huge, polished, purpose-built corporate identities of the larger clubs, and in terms of music and atmosphere it was far closer to the warehouse and open-air raves of the acid house era. Originally with a completely uncovered terrace (until it was covered completed in 2006) and spartan appearance, with planes flying low over the club (its location was barely a kilometre from the end of the airport runway) and clubbers of a more European make-up than bigger venues, it had a hedonistic outlook and attitude. Luciano began his residency at DC10 in 2006.  2008–2010 seasons  After difficulties in 2007, on 6 October 2008, the venue was shut down by the Spanish authorities after previous closures and court battles with the government. This was due mainly to the venue only having a license for 65 people (which it regularly exceeded). The 2008 season closing party was held at Privilege nightclub after the surprise closure, due to many tourists having pre-booked flights and accommodation in anticipation of the final party. In 2009, Spanish authorities levied a 300,000 euro fine and another year's closure upon the club. On 8 September 2009, rumors about the reopening of the club were confirmed by owner Andrea who announced that the club would reopen on Tuesday, 6 October for Circoloco, the day the previous ban expired. Against expectations, the club reopened in 2010 for the season on 31 May, with parties continuing every Monday (Circoloco) and Friday (Pandemonium) until closing on 4 October, reopening doors on New Year's Eve 2011. New resident DJs for Circoloco included Jamie Jones and Seth Troxler and there were special performances by the likes of Tony Humphries.  Recent years (2011–present)  Building on its successful return in 2010, DC10 remained open and busy throughout 2011, enjoying one of its busiest summers to date. Circoloco continued its 2010 The New Era party into The Next Level, as well as continuing Friday's Pandemonium party, hosted by Tania Vulcano, into 2011. Circoloco also added a new concept, From Disco to Techno, which ran every Wednesday and had label showcases from Visionquest, Hot Creations and Sci + Tec. As of 2015, Circoloco continued to be held at DC10, with its grand opening on 25 May 2015. In 2017, DC10 was nominated for Club of the Year at the Electronic Music Awards. Club nights Circoloco Founded in 1999, the Circoloco parties (also written as Circo Loco) first took place at DC10 in Ibiza. Circoloco started as a Monday session at DC10 only, and soon spread to become a dance brand in many countries. In 2015 the Circoloco party debuted in Japan at a Tokyo park often used for raves, with a lineup including both Circoloco residents and local DJs. In 2015 the electronic music publication Mixmag wrote that on Ibiza \\"one of the most talked about nights on the island is of course Circoloco at DC10. Pretty much every notable name in house and techno has spun at the night.\\" As of 2015, Circoloco holds a Monday residency at DC10. The brand's opening day for 2015 was 25 May at DC10. The 13-hour marathon session ended at 4 am and featured 27 DJs, such as Kerri Chandler, Apollonia, Jackmaster, Dubfire, Ellen Allien, Jamie Jones, and Black Coffee. In August 2015, Nicole Moudaber played the weekly DC10 party, with celebrities such as Paris Hilton as audience members. On 5 October 2015, the brand held its summer closing party in Ibiza. Afterwards, the brand announced that a Circoloco party will be held at Caulfield Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia in December 2015, for a single show with many DJs. Paradise Paradise began as a Wednesday club night at DC10 organized by Jamie Jones from 2012–2019. Beyond the DC10 parties, in 2012 two Paradise nights were hosted at Brixton Academy in London. Popular demand for Paradise forced DC10 to open a second room for the crowd for the 2014 season, resulting in peak crowd attendance. The 2014 summer season lasted from 2 July to 24 September, and was dubbed A Tribe Called Paradise. The Wednesday night returned in 2015 as A Planet Called Paradise, occurring for thirteen weeks from 1 July to 12 September. Apart from Jones, 2015 residents included Dungeon Meat, Richy Ahmed, Patrick Topping, wAFF, Russ Yallop, Mark Jenkyns, Luca Cazal and Robert James. The debut night featured many of the residents and guest DJs such as The Martinez Brothers and Maya Jane Coles. 2015 also saw the debut DC10 performance from Adam Beyer, as well as artists throughout the season such as Skream and Dubfire. Paradise returned for Wednesday nights at DC10 during 2015–2019, occurring for a total of thirteen weeks each Ibiza Season from July - September. Noise restrictions In October 2017, Diario de Ibiza reported DC10 being charged by local police for exceeding noise restrictions for their closing party.

Catherine is one of two children to Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw, the original tenants of the Wuthering Heights estate. The star-crossed love between her and Heathcliff is one of the primary focuses of the novel. Catherine is often referred to as \\"Cathy,\\" particularly by Heathcliff. Biography Catherine (portrayed by Merle Oberon) and Heathcliff as portrayed in the 1939 film. Cathy Earnshaw is the younger sister of Hindley Earnshaw. Cathy and Hindley are born and raised at Wuthering Heights. The siblings are later joined by the foundling Heathcliff, who is adopted by Mr. Earnshaw during a trip to Liverpool. Heathcliff and Hindley develop a rivalry, while Catherine and Heathcliff develop a close bond, as they are both wild and unruly. Following the death of Mr. Earnshaw, Hindley demotes Heathcliff to the role of a servant and attempts, with the help of his wife, to limit the interactions between Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine and Heathcliff still manage to spend time together, and while the two of them spy on the Thrushcross Grange estate, the residence of the Linton family, Catherine is attacked by one of the Linton's dogs. The Lintons then take in Catherine and nurse her injuries, while Heathcliff is driven out of the estate and back to Wuthering Heights. Upon returning from her time with the Lintons, Catherine has developed more refined manners and become friends with Edgar and Isabella Linton. Catherine becomes spoiled and vicious, often taking it out on her servant and foster-sister Nelly. Eventually, Edgar Linton begins to court Catherine, while Heathcliff observes jealously. Catherine's most famous speech in the novel comes when she declares her feelings for Heathcliff and Edgar to Nelly Dean, the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights and the novel's main narrator: Unbeknownst to Catherine, Heathcliff was eavesdropping on her conversation with Nelly, but only heard the beginning of her speech. Under the impression that Catherine would never marry him, Heathcliff goes on a three-year hiatus from Wuthering Heights which is not elaborated on in the book. During Heathcliff's absence, Catherine marries Edgar Linton and moves into Thrushcross Grange, where she lives peacefully, her every desire indulged. Upon his return, Heathcliff pays a visit to Thrushcross Grange, which causes Catherine great excitement, and Edgar deepest dread: > Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked > the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I [Nelly] suppose they were > below, for he exclaimed quickly: \\"Don't stand there, love! Bring the person > in, if it be anyone particular.\\" Ere long, I heard the click of the latch, > and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too excited to show > gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have surmised an awful > calamity. In an awkward set of visits to the Grange, Heathcliff begins to exact his revenge, seducing Isabella Linton in order to gain control of Thrushcross Grange at Edgar's death, and trapping her in an abusive and terrifying marriage. Cathy falls into a state of psychological insanity, although it is partly feigned in her desire to provoke her husband and \\"break his heart\\" because of the pain that she feels after being forbidden to see Heathcliff. Soon she refuses to eat, never leaves her chamber, and falls prey to countless delusions and declarations of madness. It is later revealed she is pregnant. She never fully recovers from her bout of delirium, and remains weak for the rest of her life. Heathcliff and Cathy share one final meeting, about halfway through the story, which is aided reluctantly by Nelly because of Edgar's banishment of Heathcliff from the Grange. The lovers pour out their passions to one another: Cathy accuses Heathcliff of killing her, while Heathcliff laments that he cannot live when \\"his soul is in the grave\\". However, when Edgar walks unexpectedly through the door to the chamber, Cathy experiences a state of shock and faints. She dies a couple of hours after giving birth to a daughter, also named Catherine (but only referred to as Cathy throughout the novel), whose generation forms the basis of the second half of the story. Catherine's spirit lives throughout the novel. Her ghost haunts Heathcliff up to his mysterious death, and an iconic scene sees Lockwood, the first narrator in the book, visited in eerie, Gothic fashion by her ghost as a little girl, lost on the moors. In Lockwood's vision, she tries to enter the house through a window; at the end of the novel Heathcliff, having become desperate to see his lost love again, is found dead before an open window. The open window is therefore a symbol of Catherine's enduring power throughout the course of the story, and of her ultimate reunion with her love; however, it also raises ambiguities as to the nature of the reunion.  Description  Cathy is described as pretty, with, as Nelly says, \\"the bonniest eye\\" and \\"the sweetest smile.\\" She has long locks of \\"beautiful\\" brown hair, as Heathcliff describes it, but it is her eyes that can be seen in many characters in the novel. The dark brown. Cathy is willful, wild, passionate, mischievous and, as a child, spoiled. As may be seen by the markedness of her change after her few weeks stay at Thrushcross Grange. During Cathy's fatal illness, Nelly notes that Catherine is very frail, and has \\"a bloodless lip\\", an image which serves to augment the Gothic undertones of her final days; nevertheless, Nelly describes her in death as divine: \\"no angel in heaven looked as beautiful as her\\", and her countenance resembled \\"perfect peace\\".  Effect on modern society and popular culture  Cathy delivers many of the lines which have become synonymous with the work, such as her renowned declaration of love for Heathcliff — > My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it, > I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees — my love for Heathcliff > resembles the eternal rocks beneath — a source of little visible delight, > but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff — he's always, always in my mind — not > as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself — but as my > own being — so, don't talk of our separation again — it is impracticable. > (Heathcliff, for his part, provides a similar comparison between the > respective loves that he and Linton feel for her: \\"If he loved with all the > powers of his puny being, he could not love as much in eighty years as I > could in a day\\") — and the famous ghostly utterance, \\"Let me in your window - I'm so cold!\\", was later used by Kate Bush in her 1978 hit \\"Wuthering Heights\\". The entertainment world, indeed, has been so intrigued by the love between Catherine and Heathcliff that many film adaptations of the novel, particularly the 1939 version with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, cover only half of the story, ending with Catherine's death rather than the lives of the younger Cathy, Hareton, and Linton Heathcliff. Thematically, Catherine and her choice to marry Edgar rather than Heathcliff are central to the issues of nature versus nurture, self versus society, class division, and violence in Wuthering Heights, as well as to the antitheses of good and evil, and physical existence and spiritual existence, which pervade the novel.

Description Feet are only partly webbed (Alpine Lakes Wilderness) Appearance The Cascades frog has a green to brown color on its back and a light yellow on its throat and belly. A range from a few to about 50 gray spots are located on its back. Depending on the situation, the spots may change color from the lighter gray/brown to a darker black spot. The colors on the frog's back are also used to attract mates. The shape of the frog's head is most commonly an oval with the mouth coming out to a slight specific point. Adult frogs range from 50 to 65 mm in length. Voice The advertisement call of the R. cascadae is a faint series of low, grating, clucking noises. Calls are produced at night and during the day from above and under the water. Habitat The Cascade frog was first discovered in the Cascade Mountains in the California regions. It can be found throughout the Cascade Mountains from Washington through Oregon, and California. They concentrate heavily around the volcanic area of the peaks. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate grassland, rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes generally between in elevation. The range may extend lower in Washington. They can be found in relatively small, permanent and temporary ponds also found along streams in summer. The adults generally stay close to water, particularly along sunny shores, under dry summer conditions, but can be found traversing uplands during high humidity. Behavior Reproduction Cascades frogs lay their eggs May 20 through July 10, depending on when the snow melts and creates ponds in which the eggs are laid. First, egg masses are deposited in comparatively warm water along gradually sloping shorelines, often over soft substrates protected from severe wave action. Females can only breed once a year, but whether they skip years remains unknown. A single female will lay up to 425 eggs at a time, but very few tadpoles will live past their first year. The placement of clusters of egg masses in shallow water soon after the first thaw can make them susceptible to freezing and pathogen transmission between clusters. The eggs hatch within eight to 20 days. Their larval period lasts 80 to 95 days. Most frogs reach their full size after three years, after which they become fertile and can begin mating. Adults appear to use the same breeding sites for several years. Larvae metamorphose in two to three months (Alpine Lakes Wilderness) Diet Larvae are thought to be primarily benthic feeders, but specific preferences are not well known. The diets of the adult Cascades frogs are poorly known, as well, but they are thought to consume a variety of invertebrate prey and will occasionally consume other frogs and tadpoles. Population An adult in Mount Rainier National Park Females have a higher mortality rate than the males, but both are believed to live over five years, sometime reaching up to seven. Recently, a decline in the Cascade frog species has occurred, but the declines are not too serious, and usually only occur in the southern part of this frog's range. Causes are not fully known, but introduced predators such as trout and bullfrogs, UV-B radiation, diseases, and loss of open meadow habitat due to fire suppression have been suggested. Fertilizers such as urea may also pose a threat to the Cascades frogs, because the juveniles were not capable of sensing and avoiding toxic levels in laboratory studies. Predation The main predators of the Cascades frogs are the raccoon, mink coyote, water bugs (Belostomatidae), garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis), and several bird species, such as the sharp shinned hawks, owls, Canada jays, and American robin. The long-toed salamander and adult R. cascadae frogs are predators to the eggs and tadpoles, as well. Pharmacology To guard itself from other microorganisms that live in the environment, the Cascades frog produces high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides it secretes from its skin in response to infection or stress. According to Conlon, \\"frogs belonging to the genus Rana represent a particularly rich source of peptides with diverse structures and specificities against micro-organisms\\". He began testing the frog secretions to determine whether or not the peptides would have an effect on bacteria that attack human cells. He found the chemical ranatuerin-2CSa, which is produced by R. cascadae, impeded the growth of E. coli and S. aureus in humans. These anti- infective agents give the Cascades frogs “therapeutic potential for the future”, according to Conlon. A drawback of the R. cascadae peptide, however, is it acts as a blood thinner for humans and decreases the supply of oxygen in the bloodstream. A recently discovered chemical, D-lysine, was produced by adding amino acids to the peptides to help decrease the toxicity to the human cells. It is a substitute for ranatuerin-2CSa, which makes analogs of naturally occurring peptides that lack significant hemolytic activity. Since the strength of the blood thinning properties is greatly reduced, it is almost harmless to humans. References *Blaustein, A. R., T. S. Garcia, D. J. Paoletti.

It is endemic to the Andaman Islands, India, and is known from the South Andaman Island, Long Island, and North Andaman Island. Taxonomy Ingerana charlesdarwini was described in 1998 as Rana charlesdarwini by , but was moved to the genus Ingerana in 2006. It remains uncertain whether it truly belongs to Ingerana. Later on, specimens labelled as Rana doriae andamanensis collected by Nelson Annandale were found from the Zoological Survey of India. However, Annandale never formally described a taxon using that name, so it is an unavailable name. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded and has a blunt tip. The tympanum is distinct and exposed; the supra-tympanic fold is well-developed and forms a thick, fleshy ridge. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are partially webbed. The finger and toe tips bear swollen discs, without circum-marginal grooves. Skin has minute granules scattered all over the dorsum; the venter is smooth. Colouration is variable with three different morphs: * The first morph is dull olive brown but has a bright orange butterfly-like marking on the dorsum behind the occiput, and a smaller spot of the same colour above the sacral region. Only very feeble black subocular spots are present, and the limbs lack barred pattern. * The second type is light tan and has very distinct black bars on the limbs. The dorsum has only a feeble W-like marking on the mid- dorsum and two indistinct orange spots. A mid-dorsal stripe might be present. Under moist conditions, the colour turns dark brown. Males have a dark gular vocal sac. * The third morph, which is similar to the holotype, is bright creamy white but with a dark brown patch on the dorsum as well as very thin, creamy white mid-dorsal stripe and two distinct, white subocular spots. Again, males have a dark gular vocal sac. Habitat and conservation Ingerana charlesdarwini have been found in primary evergreen and secondary forests at elevations below . The eggs are laid in water-filled tree holes. It is threatened by habitat loss (clear-cutting). The type series was collected in the Mount Harriet National Park, and the species is also known from the Saddle Peak National Park.

On April 28, 1945, his mother married Theodore Frank (whom Joe called Freddy in his show, and in the article 'Joe Frank is off the air' in the 'LA Weekly' in 1997) and changed Joe's last name.Joe Frank :: News and Reviews – LA Weekly – \\"Joe Frank is Off the Air\\" In his twenties, Frank studied at Hofstra University in New York and later at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. In 1964, he taught five grades of English at the Sands Point Academy for Gifted Children in Sands Point, NY. From 1965-1975, Joe taught English and Russian literature and philosophy at the Dalton School in Manhattan and later, while working as a music promoter (1976-1977), became interested in the power of radio.March 7, 2000 Salon.com article by Susan Emerling. NPR, 1978-1984 In 1977, Frank started volunteering at Pacifica Network station WBAI in New York, performing experimental radio involving monologues, improvisational actors, and live music during late-night, free-form hours. In 1978, he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a co-anchor for the weekend edition of National Public Radio's All Things Considered, his first paying radio job, which lasted two weeks. At the end of each segment, he was given five minutes to create and narrate his creative fictional essays. In 1978-1984, Joe performed in, and produced 18 dramas for the \\"NPR Playhouse,\\" which won several awards. His 1982 monologue \\"Lies\\" was used, without permission, as the inspiration for the Martin Scorsese movie After Hours. (He later was \\"paid handsomely\\" in an out-of-court settlement.) KCRW, 1986–2018 In 1986, on the invitation of Ruth Hirschman Seymour, the general manager of NPR's Santa Monica, California, affiliate KCRW, Frank moved to Santa Monica, where he wrote, produced, and performed in his own weekly hour-long radio program, \\"Joe Frank: Work In Progress.\\" While at KCRW, Frank received several accolades. Joe Frank continued to work at KCRW until 2002, and his work evolved, as evidenced by the diverse series he produced. The first was \\"Work in Progress,\\" then \\"In The Dark,\\" followed by \\"Somewhere out There\\", and finally \\"The Other Side.\\" Beginning in 2004, Frank began creating full-length shows for subscribers to his web site. In 2012, Frank started producing periodic half-hour shows for KCRW's \\"UnFictional\\" series. He continued to produce all-new shows for the series until months before his death. Other activities and personal life Starting in 2003, Frank performed on stage with original material at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, CA, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago, Illinois; at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco; and in Los Angeles at the Hammer Museum and Largo at the Coronet, as well as other venues. His 230-hour body of work continues to be re-aired on WNYC New York, and many NPR stations including the radio station at the University of California at Davis, KDVS, Savannah, Georgia WRUU, Cabool, Missouri KZGM, Carson City, Nevada KNVC, and others with new stations being added. In early 2005, Frank suffered complete kidney failure. He received a second cousin's kidney in 2006, which continued to function normally (with the help of multiple immunosuppressant drugs) until his death. In 2012, Frank returned to KCRW for episodes of the station's \\"UnFictional\\" program. In May 2014, Frank had surgery to treat colon cancer, which was successful. In December 2015, Frank was hospitalized due to a gastrointestinal perforation following a routine medical procedure. This led to heart and kidney issues and Joe's complete recovery took a full year. His colon cancer returned in July 2017; he had surgery in October 2017 to excise a tumor in his colon. He died on January 15, 2018, after multiple reversals following the surgery, including an occurrence of sepsis, which was the final blow. Radio program style Frank's radio programs are often dark and ironic and employ a dry sense of humor and the sincere delivery of ideas or stories that are patently absurd. Subject matter often includes religion, life's meaning, death, and Frank's relationships with women. Frank's voice is distinctive, resonant, authoritative, and, because of his occasional voice-over work, often oddly familiar. At the 2003 Third Coast Festival, he explained that he was recording in Dolby and playing back without it, which created Joe's now familiar intimate and gritty sound.Third Coast Archives – scroll to bottom for speech. A 1987 Los Angeles Times article described it as a voice \\"like dirty honey\\" and \\"rich as chocolate.\\" The repetitive cadence of the music, drones and Frank's dry, announcer-like delivery are sometimes mixed with recorded phone calls with actor/friends such as Larry Block, Debi Mae West and Arthur Miller (not the playwright), broken into segments over the course of each hour-long program. Frank's series \\"The Other Side\\" included excerpts from Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield's Dharma talks at Spirit Rock Meditation Center. In an interview on KPFA's \\"Morning Show,\\" Kornfield was asked about working with Joe Frank. Kornfield explained that, although he had never met or talked to Joe Frank or heard his show, he didn't mind Frank using the lectures and that many of his meditation students had found Kornfield through the show.

First published in 1975, Yates's fourth book concerns the psychological breakdown and subsequent institutionalization of an alcoholic salesman. Semi- autobiographical, the novel was dismissed by critics as his weakest book. Plot summary A prototypical Yatesian dreamer, John C. Wilder is a bored but successful salesman of advertising space, living in New York City who seeks refuge from the disappointments of his life in alcohol and adultery. He breaks down during a distillers' convention. Lacking sleep and the worse for alcohol upon his return to New York, he threatens his family. His friend, Paul Borg, has him committed to the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital in New York. Upon his release he seeks help from his family, psychiatrists, and AA meetings, all of whom he subsequently rejects. With the encouragement of a mistress, Pamela Hendricks, Wilder renews himself through their common love of movies and the prospect of making a film about his institutionalization. After a group of enthusiastic college students embrace his story and partially film his screenplay, Wilder leaves his family and job to move to Hollywood in the hopes of securing a deal that will complete and distribute the film. The loss of his mistress and the rejection he suffers from producers leads him even deeper into an abyss of paranoid alcoholic delusion. The novel ends with Wilder wandering the streets of Los Angeles, declaring himself to be Jesus Christ (mirroring a delusional incident in Yates's own life), and being recommitted to an institution. Critical reception Critics largely dismissed the book as Yates's weakest and wrote that it confirmed him as a one-book-writer. Fourteen years after the success of Revolutionary Road, critics were expecting a novel as astonishing as his debut to confirm his status as a great writer. While Yates's short-story collection Eleven Kinds of Loneliness was celebrated, his second novel A Special Providence was panned. The lackluster sales and critical reception for Disturbing the Peace convinced many that \\"like Fitzgerald and so many others, he’d squandered his talent, drank it away.\\" This reputation persisted until the following year when Yates published his acclaimed novel The Easter Parade. For some period of time, Joe Pesci held the film rights but never acted on it.

It is known from its type locality in the vicinity of Sa Pa in northern Vietnam near the Chinese border, Hong Kong, and Houaphanh Province in eastern Laos; presumably it also occurs the intervening areas. The Hong Kong record is considered suspicious, however. Moreover, some sources, notably the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, regard this species as a junior synonym of Amolops mengyangensis. Etymology The specific name daorum refers to the Dao people of northern Vietnam. Common name Dao frog has been coined for this species. Taxonomy Amolops daorum was described in 2003 as Rana daorum based on specimens from northern Vietnam. In 2007, Ohler concluded that it is a junior synonym of Amolops mengyangensis, but this conclusion was challenged by Stuart, Biju, and others who considered it valid as Amolops daorum. As of late 2018, the Amphibian Species of the World and AmphibiaWeb databases recognize Amolops daorum as a valid species. Meanwhile, placement of this species in the genus Odorrana appears to have been caused by a DNA sample allegedly representing this species actually coming from Odorrana hmongorum. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout–vent length. The body is dorsoventrally compressed. The tympanum is distinct and round. The finger and the toe tips bear discs. The toes are fully webbed. The dorsum is green and occasionally has black spots. The flanks are brown and bear at least one large white glandular spot. A white lip stripe runs from the nostril to above the arm insertion. The tympanum and the loreal region are dark brown. The venter is creamy white. Habitat and conservation The type series of Amolops daorum was collected from and near streams: the males were on partially submerged rocks in cascades as well as in vegetation adjacent to the streams, whereas females were found slightly farther away from streams in denser vegetation. The elevation at the locality was above sea level. As of late 2018, Amolops daorum has not been assessed as an independent species for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but included in Amolops mengyangensis.

Volume 13, 1992, pp. 293–295. The species is collected from the wild for human consumption. Description Like most frogs, Epirus water frogs show sexual dimorphism. Males can grow to in length, with females growing larger to . The dorsal side is typically green with irregular black spots. The underside is pale. Male vocal sacs are olive aside from mating season, when they can turn a dark gray. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, rivers, swamps, freshwater lakes and marshes, and plantations. It is threatened by habitat loss, and is classified as vulnerable as populations within its relatively small range are fragmented. Reproductive behavior The spawning period extends from the end of April to the beginning of May and can change by a few days depending on the latitude and altitude of a population and the local weather. In the case of high reproductive activity, calling begins in the morning at around 9 a.m. and lasts until midnight or longer with a longer break at dusk, during which the frogs are catching insects. Calling Epirus water frogs have been observed at water temperatures between 13 and 24.5 °Celsius. Mating call The calls consist of very short pulses with intervals in between, which is why the calls sound creaky. According to the calculated equations, the calls last for 616 milliseconds at a water temperature of 15 °Celsius and consist of 32 pulses. As the temperature rises, the duration of the calls decreases, while the number of pulses per call increases. The frequency spectrum has a strong component between 1400 and 2400 Hertz. The males mostly give the calls in series.

They are located mostly on the presynaptic membrane and contain a single transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain interacts with proteins in the synaptic cleft, most notably neuroligin, while the intracellular cytoplasmic portion interacts with proteins associated with exocytosis. Neurexin and neuroligin \\"shake hands,\\" resulting in the connection between the two neurons and the production of a synapse. Neurexins mediate signaling across the synapse, and influence the properties of neural networks by synapse specificity. Neurexins were discovered as receptors for α-latrotoxin, a vertebrate-specific toxin in black widow spider venom that binds to presynaptic receptors and induces massive neurotransmitter release. In humans, alterations in genes encoding neurexins are implicated in autism and other cognitive diseases, such as Tourette syndrome and schizophrenia.  Structure  In mammals, neurexin is encoded by three different genes (NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3) each controlled by two different promoters, an upstream alpha (α) and a downstream beta (β), resulting in alpha-neurexins 1-3 (α-neurexins 1-3) and beta-neurexins 1-3 (β-neurexins 1-3). In addition, there are alternative splicing at 5 sites in α-neurexin and 2 in β-neurexin; more than 2000 splice variants are possible, suggesting its role in determining synapse specificity. The encoded proteins are structurally similar to laminin, slit, and agrin, other proteins involved in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. α-Neurexins and β-neurexins have identical intracellular domains but different extracellular domains. The extracellular domain of α-neurexin is composed of three neurexin repeats which each contain LNS (laminin, neurexin, sex-hormone binding globulin) – EGF (epidermal growth factor) – LNS domains. N1α binds to a variety of ligands including neuroligins and GABA receptors, though neurons of every receptor type express neurexins. β-Neurexins are shorter versions of α-neurexins, containing only one LNS domain. β-Neurexins (located presynaptically) act as receptors for neuroligin (located postsynaptically). Additionally, β-Neurexin has also been found to play a role in angiogenesis. The C terminus of the short intracellular section of both types of neurexins binds to synaptotagmin and to the PDZ (postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/discs large/zona-occludens-1) domains of CASK and Mint. These interactions form connections between intracellular synaptic vesicles and fusion proteins. Thus neurexins play an important role in assembling presynaptic and postsynaptic machinery. Trans- synapse, the extracellular LNS domains have a functional region, the hyper- variable surface, formed by loops carrying 3 splice inserts. This region surrounds a coordinated Ca2+ ion and is the site of neuroligin binding, resulting in a neurexin-neuroligin Ca2+-dependent complex at the junction of chemical synapses. Expression and function Neurexins are diffusely distributed in neurons and become concentrated at presynaptic terminals as neurons mature. There exists a trans-synaptic dialog between neurexin and neuroligin, meaning neuroligin can induce the expression of neurexin and vice versa. This bi-directional trigger aids in the formation of synapses and is a key component to modifying the neuronal network. Over-expression of either of these proteins causes an increase in synapse forming sites, thus providing evidence that neurexin plays a functional role in synaptogenesis. Conversely, the blocking of β-neurexin interactions reduces the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. It is not clear how exactly neurexin promotes the formation of synapses. One possibility is that actin is polymerized on the tail end of β-neurexin, which traps and stabilizes accumulating synaptic vesicles. This forms a forward feeding cycle, where small clusters of β-neurexins recruit more β-neurexins and scaffolding proteins to form a large synaptic adhesive contact.  Neurexin-neuroligin binding  The trans- synaptic dialog between neurexin and neuroligin organizes the apposition of pre- and post-synaptic machinery by recruiting scaffolding proteins and other synaptic elements such as NMDA receptors, CASK, and synaptotagmin, all of which are necessary for a synapse to exist. The different combinations of neurexin to neuroligin, and alternative splicing of neuroligin and neurexin genes, control binding between neuroligins and neurexins, adding to synapse specificity. Neurexins alone are capable of recruiting neuroligins in postsynaptic cells to a dendritic surface, resulting in clustered neurotransmitter receptors and other postsynaptic proteins and machinery. Their neuroligin partners can induce presynaptic terminals by recruiting neurexins. Synapse formation can therefore be triggered in either direction by these proteins. Neuroligins and neurexins can also regulate formation of glutamatergic (excitatory) synapses, and GABAergic (inhibitory) contacts using a neuroligin link. Regulating these contacts suggests neurexin-neuroligin binding could balance synaptic input, or maintain an optimal ratio of excitatory to inhibitory contacts. Additional interacting partners Neurexins not only bind to neuroligin. Additional binding partners of neurexin are dystroglycan and neuroexophilins. Dystroglycan is Ca2+-dependant and binds preferentially to α-neurexins on LNS domains that lack splice inserts. In mice, a deletion of dystroglycan causes long-term potentiation impairment and developmental abnormalities similar to muscular dystrophy; however baseline synaptic transmission is normal. Neuroexophilins are Ca2+-independent and bind exclusively to α-neurexins on the second LNS domain. The increased startle responses and impaired motor coordination of neuroexophilin knockout mice indicates that neuroexophilins have a functional role in certain circuits. The significance of the relationship between neurexin and dystroglycan or neuroexophilins is still unclear.  Species distribution  Members of the neurexin family are found across all animals, including basal metazoans such as porifera (sponges), cnidaria (jellyfish) and ctenophora (comb jellies). Porifera lack synapses so its role in these organisms is unclear. Homologues of α-neurexin have also been found in several invertebrate species including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, honeybees and Aplysia. In Drosophila melanogaster, NRXN genes (only one α-neurexin) are critical in the assembly of glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions but are much simpler. Their functional roles in insects are likely similar to those in vertebrates.  Role in synaptic maturation  Neurexin and neuroligin have been found to be active in synapse maturation and adaptation of synaptic strength. Studies in knockout mice show that the trans-synaptic binding team does not increase the number of synaptic sites, but rather increases the strength of the existing synapses. Deletion of the neurexin genes in the mice significantly impaired synaptic function, but did not alter synaptic structure. This is attributed to the impairment of specific voltage gated ion channels. While neuroligin and neurexin are not required for synaptic formation, they are essential components for proper function.  Clinical importance and applications  Recent studies link mutations in genes encoding neurexin and neuroligin to a spectrum of cognitive disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia, and mental retardation. Cognitive diseases remain difficult to understand, as they are characterized by subtle changes in a subgroup of synapses in a circuit rather than impairment of all systems in all circuits. Depending on the circuit, these subtle synapse changes may produce different neurological symptoms, leading to classification of different diseases. Counterarguments to the relationship between cognitive disorders and these mutations exist, prompting further investigation into the underlying mechanisms producing these cognitive disorders.  Autism  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by qualitative deficits in social behavior and communication, often including restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. It includes a subset of three disorders: childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), Asperger syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder – not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). A small percentage of ASD patients present with single mutations in genes encoding neuroligin-neurexin cell adhesion molecules. Neurexin is crucial to synaptic function and connectivity, as highlighted in wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in individuals with neurexin deletions. This provides strong evidence that neurexin deletions result in increased risk of ASDs, and indicate synapse dysfunction as the possible site of autism origin. Dr. Steven Clapcote et al.'s α-neurexin II (Nrxn2α) KO mice experiments demonstrate a causal role for the loss of Nrxn2α in the genesis of autism-related behaviors in mice.  Schizophrenia  Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric illness with multiple genes and environmental exposures involved in its genesis. Further research indicates that deletion of the NRXN1 gene increases the risk of schizophrenia. Genomic duplications and deletions on a micro-level – known as copy number variants (CNVs) – often underlie neurodevelopmental syndromes. Genomic-wide scans suggest that individuals with schizophrenia have rare structural variants that deleted or duplicated one or more genes. As these studies only indicate an increased risk, further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the genesis of cognitive diseases.  Intellectual disability and Tourette syndrome  Similar to schizophrenia, studies have shown that intellectual disability and Tourette syndrome are also associated with NRXN1 deletions. A recent study shows that NRXN genes 1-3 are essential for survival and play a pivotal and overlapping role with each other in neurodevelopment. These genes have been directly disrupted in Tourette syndrome by independent genomic rearrangements. Another study suggests that NLGN4 mutations can be associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions and that carriers may be affected with milder symptoms.

These are called synaphin 1 and 2. In the presence of Ca2+, the transport vesicle protein synaptotagmin displaces complexin, allowing the SNARE protein complex to bind the transport vesicle to the presynaptic membrane. Complexin acts as both an inhibitor and a facilitator of synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. In one conformation, it clamps SNAREpin complexes, preventing vesicle fusion, while in a different conformation it releases the SNAREpins, allowing synaptotagmin to trigger fusion. Whereas complexin is not necessary for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, it does increase neurotransmitter release by 60–70% as demonstrated by complexin gene knockout in mice. A number of human neurological diseases have been linked to a deficiency of complexin. Synaphin can promote exocytosis by promoting interaction between the complementary syntaxin and synaptobrevin transmembrane regions that reside in opposing membranes prior to fusion. Structure and Binding Complexin is a small highly charged cytosolic protein that is hydrophilic, rich in glutamic acid and lysine residues. Complexin's central region (amino acids 48–70) binds to the SNARE core as an anti-parallel α-helix, which attaches complexin to the SNARE complex. It interacts selectively with the ternary SNARE complex but not with monomeric SNARE proteins. Complexin binds to the groove between the synaptobrevin and syntaxin helices. Complexin stabilizes the C-terminal part of the SNARE complex. Function Complexin acts as a positive regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and binds selectively to the neuronal SNARE complex. Complexin has a two-fold function in that it can act as either a promoter or an inhibitor of vesicle fusion. This dual-functionality is dependent upon synaptic activity such as a depolarizing stimulus arriving at the synapse. By acting as a fusion clamp in inhibiting fusion, and a promoter during depolarization, complexin concentration levels regulate vesicle pool size such as that of the ready releasable pool, important for short term response changes. Complexin Acts to Inhibit Fusion - Fusion Clamping Inhibition of fusion is necessary to prevent spontaneous exocytosis of vesicles into the synapse. If a clamp does not hold synaptic vesicle pools stable and inhibit them from fusing, the potential for spontaneous firing and depletion of the vesicle pool is much greater. It is believed that the C-terminal domain of complexin is responsible for this inhibitory function. In several eukaryotic organisms, mutations to complexin were linked to dramatic increases in spontaneous exocytosis rates. A possible mechanism for how complexin mechanistically anchors vesicles to prevent fusion involves inhibitory binding to the assembling SNARE complex. It is suggested that complexin's N-terminal alpha-helix domain incorporates itself into the SNARE complex helix bundle and prevents zippering of the assembly. In contrast to this, another hypothesis is that complexin, independent of synaptotagmin interactions, cross-links with SNARE complexes in a zig-zag array. Recent data supports the former, that synaptotagmin plays a role in causing a conformational change in SNARE interactions similar to the change caused by calcium. This binding of calcium-bound synaptotagmin creates an interaction that releases the fusion clamp of complexin, causing membrane fusion and exocytosis to occur. *Calcium Effects In low levels of calcium, complexin has a comparatively stronger clamping and inhibitory effect on spontaneous vesicle release. This is thought to be countered by synaptotagmin at increasing calcium levels, as the activity of synaptotagmin increases, providing more energy to remove the clamping effect of complexin. Complexin Acts to Promote Fusion Complexin can also promote fusion when a stimulus is transmitted to the synapse. Independent of its clamping functionality (such as when the C-terminal of complexin is knocked out), complexin can still function as an exocytosis promoter. This pathway is mediated by synaptotagmin-10 Association with Synaptotagmin Complexin knockdown experiments have been linked to Synaptotagmin-1 and -10 dependent exocytosis. Both Synaptotagmin proteins seem reliant on a complexin co-factor, indicating complexin's importance across the synaptotagmin family.

Its natural habitats are temperate forests, temperate grassland, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater springs, and pastureland. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.  Reproduction  Reproductive periods occur only once a year, beginning shortly after hibernation in February and ending in April. The process involves a call from the male, which can come from either under or above the water surface, mainly during the night. Males will, however, call during the day depending on water temperature.Asimakopoulos, B., Sofianidou, T. S.,Schneider, H.: Reproductive and calling behavior of the Greek frog Rana graeca (Amphibia: Anura) in Greece. In: Zoologischer Anzeiger. Volume 225, 1990, pp. 134-143. Spots seen as safe and out of sight by the species, such as dark crevices in the bank under roots or stones, are its first choice for calling and mating sites. The egg masses are then attached to the roof of a cavity. Each egg mass may contain anywhere from 200 to 2000 individual eggs, which range from 2 to 3.5 millimetres in diameter, surrounded by a protective gelatinous envelope of size between 4 and 7 millimetres. Observation has led to believe that males can guard the eggs for a certain amount of time. The newly hatched larvae are about 9 millimetres in length, and grow up to 45 millimetres in anywhere from two to three months (water temperature may, however, cause development to slow down). After their third hibernation, the new Rana graeca reach sexual maturity. References *Stuart, S.N. & Cox, N. 2004. Rana graeca. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 23 July 2007.
