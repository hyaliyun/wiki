Wahl threw and batted right-handed, and stood tall and weighed . Early life Wahl was born in Columbia, South Dakota, graduated from high school in that town, and attended Indiana University. He was signed off the IU campus by the Reds in during the World War II manpower shortage and made his major league debut as a pinch runner and pinch hitter during four early summer games. In his first big-league at bat, he popped out on July 2 against Johnny Allen of the New York Giants; he stayed in the game at third base, but handled no chances in the field.1944-7-2(2) box score from Retrosheet Wahl also spent part of the 1944 season with the Reds' Class A1 affiliate, the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association. Playing career The campaign was one of three full seasons Wahl spent at the major league level. He appeared in 71 games for the Reds, starting 28 games at shortstop and 27 at second base, and batted .201 with 39 hits. On August 21, he had three hits in four at bats, including a double and two triples, but the Reds fell to the Philadelphia Phillies, 6‚Äì3, at Shibe Park.1945-8-21 box score from Retrosheet With the war over and major leaguers returning from military service, Wahl spent all of with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, where he played shortstop and batted .271 in 109 games. That led to another major league trial, and Wahl made the 1947 Reds as a backup third baseman and utility infielder, but he could muster only 14 hits all season and he batted only .173 in 39 games. However, one of those hits was his first big-league home run, a two-run blow off Howie Pollet of the St. Louis Cardinals on June 27 at Sportsman's Park.1947-6-27 box score from Retrosheet Wahl played in the Triple-A International League during the following two seasons, and was acquired by the Athletics from the Brooklyn Dodgers' organization after he batted .286 in 134 games for the 1949 Montreal Royals. The season, his third and last full season in the big leagues, represented the high-water mark of his pro career. He reached career highs in games played (89), runs scored (26), hits (72), doubles (12), triples (3), homers (2), runs batted in (27), and batting average (.257). He became the Athletics' regular third baseman in July, after Bob Dillinger was sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and started 60 games at the hot corner through September 17. Wahl was not able to hold the starting third base job in , batting .186 in 20 games, and was traded, via the Chicago White Sox, to the St. Louis Browns on June 4. Although he batted .333 in limited service for the Browns, he was traded for the third time that season, on July 31 to the New York Yankees in a waiver deal. However, he did not play at the major league level for the Yankees; he was sent to the Triple-A Kansas City Blues and spent the remainder of his playing career in the American Association, retiring after the 1954 season. As a major leaguer, Wahl registered 145 hits, including 23 doubles, six triples, and three home runs. Later years In retirement, Wahl became a teacher and coach in his native South Dakota, eventually becoming a college administrator there and in Arizona, where he relocated in 1975.

A subset of techniques from certain styles of Japanese jujutsu were used to develop modern martial arts and combat sports, such as judo, sambo, ARB, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts.  Characteristics  \\"Originally derived from sanskrit term yuyutsu, meaning one who likes to fight, or who is eager to fight\\". \\"J≈´\\" can be translated to mean \\"gentle, soft, supple, flexible, pliable, or yielding\\". \\"Jutsu\\" can be translated to mean \\"art\\" or \\"technique\\" and represents manipulating the opponent's force against themselves rather than confronting it with one's own force. Jujutsu developed to combat the samurai of feudal Japan as a method for defeating an armed and armored opponent in which one uses no weapon, or only a short weapon. Because striking against an armored opponent proved ineffective, practitioners learned that the most efficient methods for neutralizing an enemy took the form of pins, joint locks, and throws. These techniques were developed around the principle of using an attacker's energy against him, rather than directly opposing it. There are many variations of the art, which leads to a diversity of approaches. Jujutsu schools (ry≈´) may utilize all forms of grappling techniques to some degree (i.e. throwing, takedowns, leg sweeps, trapping, pins, holds, joint locks, holds, chokeholds, strangulation, gouging, biting, hair pulling, disengagements, striking, and kicking). In addition to jujutsu, many schools teach the use of weapons. Today, jujutsu is practiced in both traditional self-defense oriented and modern sports forms. Derived sport forms include the Olympic sport and martial art of judo, which was developed by Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç in the late 19th century from several traditional styles of jujutsu, and sambo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which were derived from earlier (pre‚ÄìWorld War II) versions of Kodokan judo that had more emphasis on ground fighting (which also caused the creation of kosen judo).  Etymology  Jujutsu, the standard spelling, is derived using the Hepburn romanization system. Before the first half of the 20th century, however, jiu-Jitsu and ju- jitsu were preferred, even though the romanization of the second kanji as Jitsu is unfaithful to the standard Japanese pronunciation. It was a non- standardized spelling resulting from how English-speakers heard the second short u in the word, which is pronounced /…Ø/ and therefore close to a short English i. Since Japanese martial arts first became widely known of in the West in that time period, these earlier spellings are still common in many places. Ju-jitsu is still a common spelling in France, Canada, and the United Kingdom while jiu-jitsu is most widely used in Germany and Brazil. Some define jujutsu and similar arts rather narrowly as \\"unarmed\\" close combat systems used to defeat or control an enemy who is similarly unarmed. Basic methods of attack include hitting or striking, thrusting or punching, kicking, throwing, pinning or immobilizing, strangling, and joint locking. Great pains were also taken by the bushi (classic warriors) to develop effective methods of defense, including parrying or blocking strikes, thrusts and kicks, receiving throws or joint locking techniques (i.e., falling safely and knowing how to \\"blend\\" to neutralize a technique's effect), releasing oneself from an enemy's grasp, and changing or shifting one's position to evade or neutralize an attack. As jujutsu is a collective term, some schools or ryu adopted the principle of ju more than others. From a broader point of view, based on the curricula of many of the classical Japanese arts themselves, however, these arts may perhaps be more accurately defined as unarmed methods of dealing with an enemy who was armed, together with methods of using minor weapons such as the jutte (truncheon; also called jitter), tant≈ç (knife), or kakushi buki (hidden weapons), such as the ryofundo kusari (weighted chain) or the bankokuchoki (a type of knuckle-duster), to defeat both armed or unarmed opponents. Furthermore, the term jujutsu was also sometimes used to refer to tactics for infighting used with the warrior's major weapons: katana or tachi (sword), yari (spear), naginata (glaive), j≈ç (short staff), and b≈ç (quarterstaff). These close combat methods were an important part of the different martial systems that were developed for use on the battlefield. They can be generally characterized as either Sengoku period (1467‚Äì1603) katchu bu Jutsu or yoroi kumiuchi (fighting with weapons or grappling while clad in armor), or Edo period (1603‚Äì1867) suhada bu Jutsu (fighting while dressed in the normal street clothing of the period, kimono and hakama). The first Chinese character of jujutsu () is the same as the first one in judo (). The second Chinese character of jujutsu () is the same as the second one in .  History  Demonstration of a Ju-Jitsu defense against a knife attack. Berlin 1924  Origins  The written history of Jujutsu first began during the Nara period (c. 710 ‚Äì c. 794) combining early forms of Sumo and various Japanese martial arts which were used on the battlefield for close combat. The oldest known styles of Jujutsu are, Shinden Fudo-ry≈´ (c. 1130), Tenshin Sh≈çden Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´ (c. 1447), and Takenouchi-ry≈´, which was founded in 1532. Many jujutsu forms also extensively taught parrying and counterattacking long weapons such as swords or spears via a dagger or other small weapons. In contrast to the neighbouring nations of China and Okinawa whose martial arts with a few exceptions were centered on striking techniques, Japanese hand-to- hand combat forms focused heavily upon throwing (including joint-locking throws), immobilizing, joint locks, choking, strangulation, and to lesser extent ground fighting. In the early 17th century during the Edo period, jujutsu would continue to evolve due to the strict laws which were imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate to reduce war as influenced by the Chinese social philosophy of Neo-Confucianism which was obtained during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea and spread throughout Japan via scholars such as Fujiwara Seika. During this new ideology, weapons and armor became unused decorative items, so hand-to-hand combat flourished as a form of self-defense and new techniques were created to adapt to the changing situation of unarmored opponents. This included the development of various striking techniques in jujutsu which expanded upon the limited striking previously found in jujutsu which targeted vital areas above the shoulders such as the eyes, throat, and back of the neck. However towards the 18th century the number of striking techniques was severely reduced as they were considered less effective and exert too much energy; instead striking in jujutsu primarily became used as a way to distract the opponent or to unbalance him in the lead up to a joint lock, strangle or throw. During the same period the numerous jujutsu schools would challenge each other to duels which became a popular pastime for warriors under a peaceful unified government, from these challenges randori was created to practice without risk of breaking the law and the various styles of each school evolved from combating each other without intention to kill. The term j≈´jutsu was not coined until the 17th century, after which time it became a blanket term for a wide variety of grappling-related disciplines and techniques. Prior to that time, these skills had names such as , , , , , , and even the (as early as 1724, almost two centuries before Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç founded the modern art of Kodokan judo). Today, the systems of unarmed combat that were developed and practiced during the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1573) are referred to collectively as . At this period in history, the systems practiced were not systems of unarmed combat, but rather means for an unarmed or lightly armed warrior to fight a heavily armed and armored enemy on the battlefield. In battle, it was often impossible for a samurai to use his long sword or polearm, and would, therefore, be forced to rely on his short sword, dagger, or bare hands. When fully armored, the effective use of such \\"minor\\" weapons necessitated the employment of grappling skills. Methods of combat (as mentioned above) included striking (kicking and punching), various takedowns, trips, throwing (body throws, shoulder and hip throws, joint-locking throws, sacrifice throws, unbalance and leg sweeping throws), restraining (pinning, strangling, grappling, wrestling, and rope tying) and weaponry. Defensive tactics included blocking, evading, off-balancing, blending and escaping. Minor weapons such as the tant≈ç (knife), ryofundo kusari (weighted chain), kabuto wari (helmet breaker), and Kaku shi buki (secret or disguised weapons) were almost always included in Sengoku jujutsu.  Development  In later times, other ko-ry≈´ developed into systems more familiar to the practitioners of Nihon jujutsu commonly seen today. These are correctly classified as Edo j≈´jutsu (founded during the Edo period): they are generally designed to deal with opponents neither wearing armor nor in a battlefield environment but instead utilize grips and holds on opponent's clothing. Most systems of Edo jujutsu include extensive use of atemi waza (vital-striking technique), which would be of little use against an armored opponent on a battlefield. They would, however, be quite valuable in confronting an enemy or opponent during peacetime dressed in normal street attire (referred to as \\"suhada bujutsu\\"). Occasionally, inconspicuous weapons such as tant≈ç (daggers) or tessen (iron fans) were included in the curriculum of Edo j≈´jutsu. Another seldom-seen historical side is a series of techniques originally included in both Sengoku and Edo jujutsu systems. Referred to as Hojo waza ( hojojutsu, Tori Nawa Jutsu, nawa Jutsu, hayanawa and others), it involves the use of a hojo cord, (sometimes the sageo or tasuke) to restrain or strangle an attacker. These techniques have for the most part faded from use in modern times, but Tokyo police units still train in their use and continue to carry a hojo cord in addition to handcuffs. The very old Takenouchi-ryu is one of the better- recognized systems that continue extensive training in hojo waza. Since the establishment of the Meiji period with the abolishment of the Samurai and the wearing of swords, the ancient tradition of Yagy≈´ Shingan-ry≈´ (Sendai and Edo lines) has focused much towards the Jujutsu (Yawara) contained in its syllabus. Many other legitimate Nihon jujutsu Ryu exist but are not considered koryu (ancient traditions). These are called either Gendai Jujutsu or modern jujutsu. Modern jujutsu traditions were founded after or towards the end of the Tokugawa period (1868) when more than 2000 schools (ry≈´) of j≈´jutsu existed. Various supposedly traditional ryu and ryuha that are commonly thought of as koryu jujutsu are actually gendai j≈´jutsu. Although modern in formation, very few gendai Jujutsu systems have direct historical links to ancient traditions and are incorrectly referred to as traditional martial systems or koryu. Their curriculum reflects an obvious bias towards techniques from judo and Edo j≈´jutsu systems, and sometimes have little to no emphasis on standing armlocks and joint-locking throws that were common in Koryu styles. They also usually do not teach usage of traditional weapons as opposed to the Sengoku j≈´jutsu systems that did. The improbability of confronting an armor- clad attacker and using traditional weapons is the reason for this bias. Over time, Gendai jujutsu has been embraced by law enforcement officials worldwide and continues to be the foundation for many specialized systems used by police. Perhaps the most famous of these specialized police systems is the Keisatsujutsu (police art) Taiho jutsu (arresting art) system formulated and employed by the Tokyo Police Department. Jujutsu techniques have been the basis for many military unarmed combat techniques (including British/US/Russian special forces and SO1 police units) for many years. Since the early 1900s, every military service in the world has an unarmed combat course that has been founded on the principal teachings of jujutsu. There are many forms of sports jujutsu, the original and most popular being judo, now an Olympic sport. One of the most common is mixed-style competitions, where competitors apply a variety of strikes, throws, and holds to score points. There are also kata competitions, where competitors of the same style perform techniques and are judged on their performance. There are also freestyle competitions, where competitors take turns attacking each other, and the defender is judged on performance. Another more recent form of competition growing much more popular in Europe is the Random Attack form of competition, which is similar to Randori but more formalized.  Description  The word Jujutsu can be broken down into two parts. \\"Ju\\" is a concept. The idea behind this meaning of Ju is \\"to be gentle\\", \\"to give way\\", \\"to yield\\", \\"to blend\\", \\"to move out of harm's way\\". \\"Jutsu\\" is the principle or \\"the action\\" part of ju-jutsu. In Japanese this word means science or art. Japanese jujutsu systems typically put more emphasis on throwing, pinning, and joint-locking techniques as compared with martial arts such as karate, which rely more on striking techniques. Striking techniques were seen as less important in most older Japanese systems because of the protection of samurai body armor and because they were considered less effective than throws and grappling so were mostly used as set-ups for their grappling techniques and throws, although some styles, such as Y≈çshin-ry≈´, Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ and Kyushin-ry≈´ had more emphasis on striking. However, many modern-day jujutsu schools include striking, both as a set-up for further techniques or as a stand-alone action. In jujutsu, practitioners train in the use of many potentially fatal or crippling moves, such as joint-locking throws. However, because students mostly train in a non-competitive environment, the risk is minimized. Students are taught break falling skills to allow them to safely practice otherwise dangerous throws. Old schools and derivations As jujutsu has so many facets, it has become the foundation for a variety of styles and derivations today. As each instructor incorporated new techniques and tactics into what was taught to him originally, he codified and developed his own ryu (school) or Federation to help other instructors, schools, and clubs. Some of these schools modified the source material enough that they no longer considered themselves a style of jujutsu. Arguments and discussions amongst the martial arts fraternity have evoked to the topic of whether specific methods are in fact not jujitsu at all. Tracing the history of a specific school can be cumbersome and impossible in some circumstances. Around the year 1600 there were over 2000 jujutsu ko-ry≈´ styles, most with at least some common descent, characteristics, and shared techniques. Specific technical characteristics, list of techniques, and the way techniques were performed varied from school to school. Many of the generalizations noted above do not hold true for some schools of jujutsu.

Ueshiba was an accomplished student of Takeda Sokaku with aikido being a systemic refinement of defensive techniques from Aiki-Jujutsu in ways that are intended to prevent harm to either the attacker or the defender. Aikido changed much during Ueshiba's lifetime, so earlier styles (such as Yoshinkan) are more like the original Aiki-Jujutsu than ones (such as Ki-Aikido) that more resemble the techniques and philosophy that Ueshiba stressed towards the end of his life.  Bartitsu  Jujutsu was first introduced to Europe in 1898 by Edward William Barton-Wright, who had studied Tenjin Shiny≈ç-ry≈´ and Shinden Fudo-ry≈´ in Yokohama and Kobe. He also trained briefly at the Kodokan in Tokyo. Upon returning to England he folded the basics of all of these styles, as well as boxing, savate, and forms of stick fighting, into an eclectic self-defence system called Bartitsu.  Judo  Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, founder of judo Modern judo is the classic example of a sport that derived from jujutsu. Many who study judo believe as Kan≈ç did, that judo is not a sport but a self-defense system creating a pathway towards peace and universal harmony. Another layer removed, some popular arts had instructors who studied one of these jujutsu derivatives and later made their own derivative succeed in competition. This created an extensive family of martial arts and sports that can trace their lineage to jujutsu in some part. The way an opponent is dealt with also depends on the teacher's philosophy with regard to combat. This translates also in different styles or schools of jujutsu. Not all jujutsu was used in sporting contests, but the practical use in the samurai world ended circa 1890. Techniques like hair-pulling, eye- poking, and groin attacks were and are not considered acceptable in sport, thus, they are excluded from judo competitions or randori. However, judo did preserve some more lethal, dangerous techniques in its kata. The kata were intended to be practised by students of all grades but now are mostly practised formally as complete set-routines for performance, kata competition and grading, rather than as individual self-defense techniques in class. However, judo retained the full set of choking and strangling techniques for its sporting form and all manner of joint locks. Even judo's pinning techniques have pain-generating, spine-and-rib-squeezing and smothering aspects. A submission induced by a legal pin is considered a legitimate win. Kan≈ç viewed the safe \\"contest\\" aspect of judo as an important part of learning how to control an opponent's body in a real fight. Kan≈ç always considered judo a form of, and development of, jujutsu. A judo technique starts with gripping the opponent, followed by off-balancing them and using their momentum against them, and then applying the technique. Kuzushi (the art of breaking balance) is also used in jujutsu, whereby an opponent's attack is deflected using their momentum against them in order to arrest their movements then throw them or pin them with a technique ‚Äî thus controlling the opponent. It is known in both systems that kuzushi is essential in order to use as little energy as possible. Jujutsu differs from judo in a number of ways. In some circumstances, judoka generate kuzushi by striking one's opponent along his weak line. Other methods of generating kuzushi include grabbing, twisting, poking or striking areas of the body known as atemi points or pressure points (areas of the body where nerves are close to the skin ‚Äì see kyusho-jitsu) to unbalance opponent and set up throws.  Brazilian jiu-jitsu  Mitsuyo Maeda Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) was developed after Mitsuyo Maeda brought judo to Brazil in 1914. Maeda agreed to teach the art to Luiz Fran√ßa, Jacintho Ferro and Carlos Gracie, son of his friend, businessman and politician Gast√£o Gracie. Luiz Fran√ßa went on to teach it to Oswaldo Fadda. After Carlos learned the art from Ferro and Maeda, he passed his knowledge to his brothers Oswaldo, Gast√£o Jr., and George. Meanwhile, H√©lio Gracie would peek in and practise the techniques, although he was told he was too young to practise. At the time, Judo was still commonly called Kan≈ç jiu-jitsu (from its founder Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç), which is why this derivative of judo is called Brazilian jiu-jitsu rather than Brazilian judo. Its emphasis shifted to ground fighting because the Gracie family thought that it was easier to learn than throws and standup grappling, more efficient and much more practical. Carlos and Helio helped the development by promoting fights (mostly against practitioners of other martial arts), competitions and experimenting throughout decades of intense training. BJJ dominated the first large modern mixed martial arts competitions in the United States, causing the emerging field to adopt many of its practices. Less-practised stand-up techniques in Gracie jiujitsu survive in some BJJ clubs from its judo and jujutsu heritage (judo throws, knife defense, gun defense, blocking, striking etc.).  Sambo  Anatoly Kharlampiyev (right) shows a set-up for a standard Samoz arm-knot, which, if proceeded further, would turn into a standing Nelson hold without taking down the opponent Sambo (an acronym from samozashchita bez oruzhia, Russian for \\"self defense without a weapon\\") was an early Soviet martial art, a direct descendant of judo, developed in the 1920s by Viktor Spiridonov, the Dynamo Sports Society jujutsu instructor, and Russo-Japanese War veteran. As it was developed largely for police purposes, a special emphasis in Samoz was placed on the standing armlocks and grappling-counters in order to free oneself from hold, apprehend and escort a suspect without taking him down; Samoz utilized throws mainly as a defensive counter in case of a surprise attack from behind. Instead of takedowns, it used shakedowns to unbalance the opponent without actually dropping him down, while oneself still maintaining a steady balance. It was in essence a standing arm-wrestling, armlock mastery-type of martial art, which utilized a variety of different types of armlocks, knots and compression-holds (and counters to protect oneself from them) applied to the opponent's fingers, thumbs, wrist, forearm, elbow, biceps, shoulder, and neck, coupled with finger pressure on various trigger points of human body, particularly sensitive to painful pressure, as well as manipulating the opponent's sleeve and collar to immobilize his upper body, extremities, and subdue him. Samoz combined jujutsu with wrestling, boxing, and savate techniques for extreme street situations. Later, in the late 1930s it was methodized by Spiridonov's trainee Vladislav Volkov to be taught at military and police academies, and eventually combined with the judo-based wrestling technique developed by Vasili Oshchepkov, who was the third foreigner to learn judo in Japan and earned a second-degree black belt awarded by Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç himself, encompassing traditional Central Asian styles of folk wrestling researched by Oshchepkov's disciple Anatoly Kharlampiyev to create sambo. As Spiridonov and Oshchepkov disliked each other very much, and both opposed vehemently to unify their effort, it took their disciples to settle the differences and produce a combined system. Modern sports sambo is similar to sport judo or sport Brazilian jiu-jitsu with differences including use of a sambovka jacket and shorts rather than a full keikogi, and a special emphasis on leglocks and holds, but with much less emphasis on guard and chokes (banned in competition).  Modern schools  After the introduction of traditional Japanese jujutsu to the West, many of these more traditional styles underwent a process of adaptation at the hands of Western practitioners, molding the arts of jujutsu to suit western culture in its myriad varieties. There are today many distinctly westernized styles of jujutsu, that stick to their Japanese roots to varying degrees. Some of the largest post-reformation (founded post-1905) gendai jujutsu schools include (but are certainly not limited to these in that there are hundreds (possibly thousands), of new branches of \\"jujutsu\\"): * Judo * Aikido * Yanagi-ry≈´ Aiki Bugei * Hapkido * Brazilian jiu-jitsu * Hwa Rang Do * Takeda Ryu Nakamura Ha * Yoseikan bud≈ç * Alpha jiu jitsu * Budokwai ju-jutsu * Kawaishi ryu * Goshinbudo * Goshin-Sohei Miura-ryu * Gyokushin ryu aikido * Danzan-ry≈´ * Tenjin Shinyo Goshin-ryu * Kokusai Okazaki-ha Shin Tenshin Shin'yo-ryu * Hyou- ha Bankoku jujutsu * Seibukan jujutsu * Nihon jujutsu * Goshin jujitsu * Jugoshin ryu * Jiushin ryu * Jishukan ryu * Gendai-ry≈´ * Sanunces-ryu * Tsutsumi H≈çzan-ry≈´ * Kumite-ryu jujutsu * Ketsugo jujutsu * Jukido jujitsu * Koshinryu jujutsu * Hokutoryu ju-jutsu * American combat jujitsu * German ju- jutsu * Quantum jujitsu * 10th Planet jiu-jitsu * Miletich jiu-jitsu * Daito- ryu Saigo-ha Aiki-jujutsu * Senso-ryu Aiki-jujutsu * Hontai Hakkei Ryu Aikijujutsu * Nami-ryu Aikijujutsu * Hakk≈ç-ry≈´ * Hakk≈ç Denshin-ry≈´ * Kaze Arashi-ryu * Ogawa-ryu/Kaze no ryu Ogawa-ha * Yamanaka-ha Shind≈ç-ry≈´ * Fudoshin-ryu * Miyama-ryu * Koga-ryu * Atemi ju-jitsu * Kokusai jujutsu renmei * Small circle jujitsu * Seizan-Ry≈´ Kempo jujutsu * Shinki-ryu jujitsu * Shorinji Kan jiujitsu * AKT Combatives jujitsu * Budoshin ju-jitsu * Zen Kempo jujitsu * Ishin Ryu ju-jitsu * Shin Nakada jiujitsu * Olivecrona jiujitsu * Wad≈ç-ry≈´ * Kodoryu jujitsu È¥ªÈÅìÊµÅ * Renzoko Kaarate Kobujitsu-ryu  Sport jujutsu  There are many types of sport jujutsu. One version of sport jujutsu is known as \\"JJIF Rules Sport Ju-Jitsu\\", organized by Ju-Jitsu International Federation (JJIF) and has been recognized as an official sport of the World Games. Sport jujutsu comes in three main variants. In Duo (self- defense demonstration), both the tori (attacker) and the uke (defender) come from the same team and demonstrate self-defense techniques. In this variant, there is a special system named Random Attacks, focusing on instilling quick reaction times against any given attack by defending and countering. The tori and the uke are also from the same team but here they do not know what the attack will be, which is given to the tori by the judges, without the uke's knowledge. The second variant is the Fighting System (Freefighting) where competitors combine striking, grappling and submissions under rules which emphasise safety. Many of the potentially dangerous techniques such as scissor takedowns, necklocks and digital choking and locking are prohibited in sport jujutsu. There are a number of other styles of sport jujutsu with varying rules. The third variant is the Japanese/Ne Waza (grappling) system in which competitors start standing up and work for a submission. Striking is not allowed.  Heritage and philosophy  Japanese culture and religion have become intertwined with the martial arts in the public imagination. Buddhism, Shinto, Taoism and Confucian philosophy co-exist in Japan, and people generally mix and match to suit. This reflects the variety of outlook one finds in the different schools. Jujutsu expresses the philosophy of yielding to an opponent's force rather than trying to oppose force with force. Manipulating an opponent's attack using his force and direction allows jujutsuka to control the balance of their opponent and hence prevent the opponent from resisting the counterattack.

Around 1955, he joined his first band, The Brassettes, who included Robert Ward and who played local dances in and around Hogansville. After the band won a talent contest in Atlanta, they recorded Johnson's song, \\"Nobody Does Something For Nothing\\", for the small Stat label.Jaap Hindricks, letter in Juke Blues no.60, 2006, p.15, correcting earlier article In the late 1950s, Johnson moved to Ohio, joining Ward in the Ohio Untouchables. However, by 1961 he had returned to Atlanta, and began playing in Piano Red's band, the Interns. His song \\"Mister Moonlight\\", which he had written in high school, was first recorded by Piano Red, credited as \\"Dr. Feelgood and the Interns\\", and released in 1962 as the b-side of \\"Doctor Feel-Good\\" on OKeh 4-7144. Johnson left the Interns in about 1963, and released his first solo record, \\"Too Many Tears\\", on OKeh that year. Neither it nor its follow-up, a reworked \\"Nobody Does Something For Nothing\\", were successful. However, in 1964 the Beatles covered \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" on the album Beatles for Sale (on Beatles '65 in the US), the success of which allowed Johnson to form his own band. He recorded three singles for Columbia Records in 1966-67, including \\"My Best Just Ain‚Äôt Good Enough\\", and another single for the Josie label. Otis Redding, for whom he had previously been a support act, then introduced him to Phil Walden, who recorded three singles with him in 1968 at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, featuring the studio rhythm section. The singles included \\"Cheer Up, Daddy‚Äôs Coming Home\\" and \\"Take Me Back And Try Me\\", but again were not hits. He then formed a new band, Roy Lee Johnson & The Villagers, who recorded a self-titled album for Stax Records in 1973, influenced by the funk style of James Brown. However, the band broke up after the sudden death of 21-year-old bass player Michael James. He continued to release occasional singles in the late 1970s and 1980s, setting up his own studio and continue to perform with various bands. In the early 1990s, tracks he had recorded were released in England as the album All Night Long (Howzat LBW1). He released another album, When a Guitar Plays the Blues, in 1998.

The railroad's main line stretched from Manistee to Traverse City, with a spur line to Northport leased from the Leelanau Transit Company.\\"Description of the Manistee & North Eastern Railroad\\", MichiganRailroads.com, accessed November 20, 2008. The M & NE was originally built to help exploit the old-growth timber resources of its service area. Logs were carried to mills in Manistee. The railroad also attempted to develop a sideline as a hauler of potatoes, orchard fruit, and grain.

With their first hit single, \\"Chico Mineiro\\" (1946), they were named \\"A Dupla Cora√ß√£o do Brasil\\" (\\"The Brazilian Heart Duo\\"). They performed more than 40,000 times between 1935 and 1994, recorded more than 1,000 songs and sold over 150 million albums despite never performing outside of Brazil. History Early life and musical beginnings House in which Tonico & Tinoco lived in their early childhood, in Prat√¢nia. Born in rural S√£o Paulo to Spanish father Salvador P√©rez and Brazilian mother Maria do Carmo, Jo√£o and Jos√© Perez's passion for music came from their maternal grandparents Olegario and Isabel, who played songs on an old accordion. The brothers quickly began to learn and play songs and had their first concert on August 15, 1935. Along with their cousin Miguel, the brothers performed as Trio da Roca. The trio became known locally via radio broadcasts. In 1937 the P√©rez family relocated the city of Sorocaba, S√£o Paulo. Tonico took up work in a quarry and cement factory while Tinoco turned to shining shoes and highway construction during Brazil's economic crisis and the onset of World War II. With city life proving unbearable, the family returned to farming in the countryside. By now the Perez brothers were performing as a duo, and their return to their rural home afforded them opportunity to perform live on the radio while they continued to travel to the city on Sundays to pick up extra work. Traveling back and forth between S√£o Paulo's urban and rural areas helped the brothers to spread their music around the state, performing on the street, at festivals, entering contests and making appearances on many radio stations. The duo made their recording debut on the Continental label in 1945 with the song \\"Em Vez de Me Agradec√™\\" (\\"Instead of Thanking Me\\") the cateret√™ \\". During the recording session, the brothers sang so loudly (as they did on the farm) that they overloaded and broke the microphone. The following year the duo broke through with the single \\"Chico Mineiro\\" making Tonico e Tinoco the most famous sertaneja duo in Brazil and making it possible for the brothers to buy a home for their family. Later success In 1961 Tonico and Tinoco made their cinematic debut in Eduardo Llorente film L√° no Meu Sert√£o, based on the life and work of the duo. While the film was in production, Tonico nearly died from tuberculosis and his brother Chiquinho filled in for him for both radio and studio appearances. Despite fears that Tonico would not be able to sing after surgery, the duo were soon performing again at full caliber. In 1965 Eduardo Llorente featured the duo in another film, Obrigado √† Matar, based on the legend of Chico Mineiro and the song of the same name that had made Tonico e Tinoco famous. Another film followed in 1969‚ÄîA Marca da Ferradura (The Mark of the Horseshoe) by Nelson Teixeira Mendes and the following year the duo recorded a tribute album to Raul Torres which was completed two months after the singer died. Two less successful films‚ÄîLlorente's Os Tr√™s Justiceiros (The Three Gunslingers) and Osvaldo de Oliveira's Luar do Sert√£o had the Perez brothers give up their acting career and focus solely on music. On June 6, 1979, Tonico & Tinoco gave a three-hour concert for 2,500 people at the Municipal Theatre of S√£o Paulo, a venue that had previously been used only for operas and ballets. In 1984, they returned to the screen as a cameo in Andrew Klotzel's A Marvada Carne. Deaths Tonico & Tinoco's final concert was in Mato Grosso on August 7, 1994. Tonico died shortly thereafter. Tinoco continued to perform solo until his death on May 4, 2012, in S√£o Paulo, due to complications after respiratory failure. He was 91 years old.Death of singer Tinoco (in Portuguese) Discography Albums *1958: Suas Modas Sertanejas *1959: Na Beira da Tuia *1960: A Dupla Cora√ß√£o do Brasil *1961: A Saudade Vai *1962: La no Meu Sert√£o *1963: Cantando para o Brasil *1965: Data Feliz *1966: Artista de Circo *1966: Rancho de Palha *1969: Rei dos Pampas *1971: A Marca da Ferradura *1971: La√ßo de Amizade Compilations *1968: As 12 Mais de Tonico e Tinoco *1983: Os Grandes Sucessos de Tonico e Tinoco Singles * Chico Mineiro * Azul Cor de Anil * Rei do Volante * Minas Gerais * Boiadeiro Punho de A√ßo * Jo√£o de Barro * Oi Vida Minha!

E. Breitenbach depicting over 300 common proverbs, catchphrases, and clich√©s such as \\"You are what you eat\\", \\"a frog in the throat\\", and \\"kicked the bucket\\". It is painted on a 45 by 67 inch wooden panel and was completed in 1975 after two years work, when the artist was 24. The included sayings are painted quite literally and appear comical and bizarre, especially if one does not at first realize what the painting is about. For example, \\"You are what you eat\\" is represented in the painting by a carrot eating a carrot. The painting also contains hidden social commentary, and a reference to Pieter Bruegel the Elder (a favorite of the artist) who did a painting of Dutch proverbs in the sixteenth century. The title Proverbidioms is a simple portmanteau word combining \\"proverb\\" with \\"idioms\\". History Proverbidioms was completed in 1975 and published by Breitenbach as a poster in 1980, along with the list of included sayings. It remains in print to this day as it has proven quite popular. Several counterfeit posters have turned up over the years. In 1988, Proverbidioms was published as a jigsaw puzzle by Bits & Pieces and then by SunsOut, and is still in print. It has been licensed for other products as well. It has appeared as a set piece on the TV shows \\"Beverly Hills, 90210\\", \\"As the World Turns\\", and on a Disney pilot. Proverbidioms is used extensively in education to teach about proverbs in classrooms, in corporate creativity workshops, in teaching the deaf, and in teaching English to foreign students. The Canadian Institute of English and the Watchtower Society in particular have taken the posters to over 100 countries for this last-mentioned purpose. The artist painted additional versions of this title along with related themed paintings. In 2011 Breitenbach published an eBook titled Proverbidioms: All the Answers & Trivia. This is the first time that location maps were provided for all the idioms included in the Proverbidioms series of paintings, and in the themed paintings as well. The artist also reveals background information and illustrates the creation process for these large works. In 2012 an iPad app was made using the paintings.

The title of Presidential Designate did not bring any official office or duties, its sole purpose was to replace the President in his absence, death, or inability to hold office. History The title was instituted by the Colombian Constitution of 1863, to modify the presidential line of succession. In 1858 the office of the office Vice President of Colombia was abolished, and the line of succession was broken and modified, making the heads of the Ministries of Colombia the successors to the presidency, going from oldest to youngest. The new constitution called for annual elections of the First, Second, and Third Presidential Designates to confirm a transition of power. After the ratification of the Colombian Constitution of 1886, the vice-presidency was reinstituted, but because of the resignation of vice president Eliseo Pay√°n in 1887, Congress was forced to elect interim presidential designates once again. In 1905, President Rafael Reyes abolished once again the vice presidency, and amended the constitution to allow him to choose the presidential designates, but after his overthrow, in 1909, Congress reinstituted the titles of First and Second Presidential Designates, giving Senate the task of electing new ones every two years. Because of constitutional reforms, the title of Second Presidential Designate was terminated, leaving just one presidential designate. The Colombian Constitution of 1991, reestablished the vice presidency, but it allowed the election of a presidential designate until the end of the term of President C√©sar Gaviria.

It's the first book featuring Gabriel Allon. The Kill Artist was released in the UK on 20 June 2002. Plot summary Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister reinstates Ari Shamron as Mossad director. Shortly thereafter, Israel‚Äôs ambassador is murdered in Paris. The crime has all of the markings of Tariq al-Hourani, a terrorist mastermind. Gabriel spearheaded a team that located and killed the operatives in the ‚ÄúMunich Massacre.‚Äù Seventeen years later, Tariq took vengeance upon Gabriel‚Äîfamily member for family member‚Äîby planting a bomb under the Allons‚Äô car in Vienna. Gabriel witnessed his family‚Äôs horrifying destruction. His son Dani died instantly, while his wife Leah was left with a shattered mind and body. Nine years later, Gabriel has cut ties with the Office, secreted himself in Southern England, and poured himself into his other profession as an art restorer. Ari Shamron shows up on his doorstep. Shamron explains that he wants to assassinate Tariq but lacks support from the departmental directors at the Office. As a result, he urges Gabriel to spearhead a secret assassination operation. He accepts Shamron‚Äôs plan and begins surveillance of Yusef, a member of Tariq‚Äôs closely knit organization. Gabriel decides that he needs to set Yusef up with a female operative. He handpicks Jacqueline Delacroix (n√©e Sarah Hal√©vy), a French supermodel. Jacqueline has previously assisted three Office operations; in one of these, she worked closely with Gabriel and the two had an affair. Gabriel is careful to keep his interactions with Jacqueline to a mere professional familiarity. Jacqueline discovers that Gabriel still grieves over their affair, for its unmasking made Leah decide to accompany Gabriel on the fateful operation to Vienna. Realizing that her modeling career is declining and unfulfilling, Jacqueline accepts Gabriel‚Äôs role for her and seduces Yusef. Although this allows Gabriel to bug Yusef‚Äôs apartment, it likewise blows Jacqueline‚Äôs cover, for Yusef finds her making imprints of his keys and later sees Gabriel in his building. Gabriel is very concerned with Jacqueline‚Äôs safety and therefore tries to pull her from the operation. Shamron, however, insists that her identity as Dominique Bonard is secure and insists that Gabriel continue the plan. Meanwhile, Yusef warns Tariq that Gabriel is searching for him. Tariq designs a plan where Jacqueline must prove her professed love for Yusef by accompanying Tariq on a supposedly diplomatic mission to the United States. Indeed, Tariq recognizes Jacqueline from previous Office operations and suspects that he can use her as bait to lure Gabriel to his death. A conspiratorial relationship between Yusef and Uzi Navot, a major agent for the Office in Europe, also becomes apparent. Navot is one of the few Office operatives who knows about Shamron‚Äôs secret plot. Shortly after Jacqueline begins this ‚Äòdiplomatic‚Äô trip, she realizes that her identity and security have been compromised. Gabriel believes that he has the upper hand in the arrangement until Tariq consistently eludes him and then disappears. Tariq smuggles Jacqueline through Qu√©bec and into New York City, where he intends to make his last stand. The new PM of Israel and Yasser Arafat are in NYC that weekend to celebrate a momentous step towards creating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. Too late, Gabriel realizes that Tariq‚Äôs target is Arafat and not Israel‚Äôs PM; Gabriel hastily alerts Arafat by phone just as the disguised Tariq zones in on the kill. Arafat the diplomat calmly recounts his love for Tariq, a former associate, and urges the assassin to abandon his design. Tariq decides to let Arafat live just as Gabriel and the escaped Jacqueline arrive on the scene. Tariq shoots Gabriel in the chest, but Jacqueline pursues and kills the would-be assassin. Gabriel recovers from his wound in Israel, where Jacqueline has been forced to relocate due to media coverage of the event. One day, Gabriel spots Yusef in a local market and questions him at gunpoint. Yusef admits that he was working for Shamron as a double agent, and that Shamron had concocted the whole plot so Gabriel could finish off Tariq. When an angry Gabriel confronts Shamron, the wizened director is unapologetic and insists that it was both necessary to kill Tariq and just to have the killer be Gabriel. Once his recovery is complete, Gabriel returns to his life in southern England as an art restorer. Critical reception Rebecca Ascher-Walsh writing for Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a \\"B+,\\" describing it as \\"pure political popcorn.\\" According to Amazon.com, The New Yorker says that Silva \\"may never get around to plumbing his characters' souls, but he's having such a good time that we're content just to watch him play.\\" Randy Signor was less flattering and lamented that Silva's \\"promising career has now veered toward the predictable and slightly silly.\\" International titles Portuguese: O Artista da Morte.

Soldiers who do not have at least one parent living in Israel are called \\"Lone Soldiers\\". The Garin Tzabar members are Jewish young adults (ages 18-24, 23 for women) and sons and daughters of Israelis living abroad, who wish to make Israel their home and serve a meaningful service in the IDF as Lone Soldiers. Upon their Aliyah, the group is adopted by an Israel community (Kibbutz or the Absorption Center in Raanana) and live there for three months during which they study Hebrew and navigate the necessary bureaucratic and military processes that are required before their imminent draft. Upon enlistment, participants are required to remain on their respective Kibbutz for at least a year. In addition to Garin Tzabar staff, soldiers and educators from the IDF and teachers from the Ministry of Education assist with the transition. It is affiliated with the Hebrew Scouts Movement in Israel. Etymology In Hebrew, Garin means ‚Äúcore‚Äù or ‚Äúseed‚Äù. Aside from its literal use, the word is also used in Israel to refer to a group of people who moved to Israel together. The Hebrew word Tzabar, translated in English as sabra, is used in Israel to mean a native-born Israeli Jew. History Garin Tzabar was founded in 1991 and is run by Tzofim Tzabar Olami, a non-profit organization, with the support of the Ministry of Aliyah and Immigrant Absorption, and Nefesh B'Nefesh. The program is largely funded by Israel's Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, but also receives money from the Jewish Agency for Israel, Ministry of Education (Israel), Ministry of Defense (Israel) and private donors. There are over 400 lone soldiers that are supported by Garin Tzabar every year, and come from all over the world including the United States, Canada, Russia, France, Australia, England, Nigeria, Thailand, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, Argentina and several other locations. Each lone soldier belongs to a group (Garin) of approximately 20 soldiers who live together at a kibbutz and experience their military service together as a social unit of mutual support and camaraderie. It is the largest IDF immigrant program in Israel, partnered with the Israel Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, with more than 6,500 soldiers since inception.  Program  The Preparation Process In this initial stage, the group meets for preparation seminars, which are built to provide a reflective and selective environment. Different aspects pertaining to the move to Israel are discussed and reflected upon, including study of the cultural, political and social characteristics of Israel and a thorough introduction to the IDF and its social role in Israeli society. Each individual is encouraged to undergo a personal maturing process that will be needed to move to Israel and joining the IDF. Pre-Ulpan (Mandatory to those with a low level of Hebrew, available in the summer session only) A month and a half of extensive Hebrew Ulpan studies in the Garin Tzabar Village in Ra'anana. The participants come from all around the world, and are accompanied by social counselors. In the afternoons, there are social activities and volunteering. The Absorption Process in Israel Upon arrival in Israel, members of each Garin are placed on a hosting kibbutz. The first three months prior to basic training include: * Teaching of the Hebrew language (under Ulpan) * Pre- draft logistics such as a physical exam, mental-psychological fitness testing, and an interview with the IDF * Acclimation to History of Israel geography, and culture. * Trips throughout Israel * Adoption of host families Military Service in the IDF Upon joining the army, each Garin member follows their individual path within the IDF. The Garin continues to exist as a support system and members meet in the Garin over the weekends and on time off from the army. The Garin staff, both from the adoptive community and the Israel Scouts, continues to work with the Garin members throughout their army service. Additional seminars and programs are designed and implemented to maintain the framework of the Garin. Alumni Each Garin Tzabar member who finishes their army service joins our extensive alumni network, with over 2,500 members. The main goals of the alumni network are: social and professional networking, personal development and cooperation with current Garin Tzabar members.  Kibbutzim  Garin Tzabar has held groups of lone soldiers (Garinim) in over 30 Kibbutzim throughout Israel, and two Garin Villages (Ra'anana and Ibim). The current Kibbutzim with Garin's (groups) of lone soldier's include Ein Tzurim, Kibbutz Yehiam, Nir Oz, Ein HaShlosha, Alumim, Lahav, Kissufim, Afikim, Nir Yitzhak, Moledet, Nir Etzion, Magen, Sde Boker, Dvir, Beit Rimon, Lavi, Ginegar, Hanita, Beit Zera, Ein Dor, Neve Eitan, Maoz Haim, Kvutzat Yavne, Be'erot Yitzhak, Kvutzat Kinneret, Geva, Regba, Sha'ar HaGolan, and Sa'ad.

It was painted between 1809 and 1810 in Dresden and was first shown together with the painting The Monk by the Sea in the Prussian Academy of Arts exhibition of 1810. On Friedrich's request The Abbey in the Oakwood was hung beneath The Monk by the Sea.Held: Romantik, 2003. 81 This painting is one of over two dozen of Friedrich's works that include cemeteries or graves. After the exhibition both pictures were bought by king Frederick Wilhelm III for his collection.Wolf, 31 Today the paintings hang side by side in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin. Description This large painting is an example of a way Friedrich uses his painting skills to represent human life issues. In the painting, Friedrich painted an old abbey in the center. There are figures entering the abbey with a coffin. The artist is trying to convey a sense of passage of time by painting a human passing away. There is a sense of coldness around the area. The remains of the abbey show a broken window with no remaining glass. What is seen is that nature is there forever, while man's creation is temporary. A procession of monks, some of whom bear a coffin, head toward the gate of a ruined Gothic church in the center of the painting. Only two candles light their way. A newly dug grave yawns out of the snow in the foreground, near which several crosses can be faintly discerned. This lower third of the picture lies in darkness‚Äîonly the highest part of the ruins and the tips of the leafless oaks are lit by the setting sun. The waxing crescent moon appears in the sky. Development Ruins of Eldena near Greifswald (1825), Oil on canvas; 35 √ó 49 cm, Alte Nationalgalerie. The picture appeared at a time when Friedrich had his first public success and critical acknowledgment with the controversial Tetschener Altar. Although Friedrich's paintings are landscapes, he designed and painted them in his studio, using freely drawn plein air sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The Abbey in the Oakwood is based upon studies of the ruins of Eldena Abbey, which reappear in several other paintings. The same trees, in slightly altered forms, can also be seen in other works. Eldena Abbey may well have had personal meaning for Friedrich, as it was destroyed during the Thirty Years War by invading Swedish troops, who later used bricks from the abbey to construct fortifications. In the painting Friedrich draws a parallel between those actions and the use of Greifswald churches as barracks by occupying French soldiers. Thus, the funeral becomes a symbol of \\"the burial of Germany's hopes for resurrection\\". Friedrich may have begun work on The Abbey in the Oakwood in June 1809 after a stay in R√ºgen, Neubrandenburg.B√∂rsch-Supan, Helmut; J√§hnig, Karl Wilhelm. \\"Caspar David Friedrich\\".

Some recipes call for sauteing an onion with the chicken. After the chicken is browned, white wine is added to the cooking pan. Some recipes call for leaving the chicken in the pan while the wine is reduced, while others call for first removing the chicken, then using the wine to deglaze the pan, and then pouring the wine sauce over the chicken. The chicken and wine, combined in a dish, are then baked, after which a sauce made of cheese (often Emmenthal or Gruy√®re or both), egg yolks, and cr√®me fra√Æche is poured over it. The sauce often contains a sprinkle of nutmeg, a pinch of thyme, parsley, garlic, or a bay leaf. Some recipes call for garnishment with capers, and /or flavoring using lardons.

He scored regularly until the beginning of March, but produced only one more between then and the end of the season; this still left him as the club's top scorer, with 19 goals. He chose not to re-sign for Cheltenham, instead joining Crawley Town, newly promoted to League Two, on what Cheltenham chairman Paul Baker described as \\"staggering\\" wages. Crawley Town Thomas signed a two-year contract with Crawley Town. Manager Steve Evans described him as \\"a natural goalscorer\\" with pace and good movement who was \\"still developing\\" as a player. He made his Crawley debut as a very late substitute on the opening day of the 2011‚Äì12 season, and scored in his second game, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Macclesfield Town, but was unable to dislodge Tyrone Barnett and Matt Tubbs from the starting eleven, and was unhappy about not playing. He later claimed that Evans had told him he would be first-choice striker. Bournemouth Thomas joined League One club Bournemouth on 9 September, initially on a 93-day loan, with an agreement for the move to be made permanent for a \\"six-figure fee\\" when the January 2012 transfer window opened. In his second game, Thomas won a penalty, reacted to a rebound off the crossbar to score his first goal for the club, and set up a goal for Marc Pugh in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Leyton Orient. He began to develop a partnership with Michael Symes which both parties and manager Lee Bradbury thought could become productive. The day after his move to Bournemouth was made permanent, Thomas and Symes each scored in a 2‚Äì0 defeat of Wycombe Wanderers. Despite scoring 11 league goals, Thomas finished the season with an even longer goal drought than he had at Cheltenham; this time he scored only once after January. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Thomas had been linked with League One side Swindon Town, but Bournemouth were reluctant to sell Thomas because they were \\"low on strikers at the moment.\\" Having made only ten appearances in the first half of 2013‚Äì14 season, the club announced that he would not be offered a new contract by the club when the season ended. =Portsmouth (loan)= Thomas's barren spell at Bournemouth continued into the 2012‚Äì13 season, amid competition from Lewis Grabban and Matt Tubbs for a starting spot, and on 28 September, manager Paul Groves allowed Thomas to leave on a month's loan to fellow League One club Portsmouth. The next day, he scored a late winner against Scunthorpe United to give Portsmouth their first home league victory of the season. He and Izale McLeod performed well as a strike pairing, and helped the club to four league wins and a draw in Thomas's first five matches for the club. He was reluctant to return to his parent club if he was not going be played, and Michael Appleton wanted to keep him at Portsmouth, but newly appointed manager Eddie Howe recalled him to Bournemouth with the intention of involving him in the squad. Thomas said he thought Groves had not given him enough backing, and hoped for a fresh start under Howe, but a few days later he told the manager he wanted to leave. =Blackpool (loan)= On 22 November, Thomas followed Michael Appleton to Championship club Blackpool, on loan until 1 January 2013. His first goal came on 1 December in a 4‚Äì1 away win at Peterborough United. Although Appleton wanted him to stay, Thomas finished his spell at Blackpool with three goals from nine games and returned to Bournemouth. There was considerable interest in the player's services from Championship clubs including Derby County, Watford, Burnley and Appleton's latest club, Blackburn Rovers. But after three more appearances for Bournemouth, without scoring, Thomas signed for Birmingham City on loan until the end of the season. =Birmingham City (loan)= Thomas went straight into the starting eleven, partnering Marlon King, for Birmingham's 2‚Äì1 win against Nottingham Forest two days later. He played 71 minutes and missed a chance to score on debut, \\"plant[ing] a shot high and wide of the upright\\". Thomas struggled to make an impact until scoring his first goals, against Derby County on 9 March. The Birmingham Mail reporter described how \\"with his back to goal, Thomas wrestle- turned two defenders and showed great determination before smashing the ball in from a tight angle on the left\\" to level the scores, and a \\"thumping drive\\" in stoppage time completed a 3‚Äì1 win. Manager Lee Clark praised Thomas's hold up play and work ethic as well as his goals. Thomas himself expressed his desire to stay at Birmingham City on a permanent deal. Four weeks later, he scored his third and last goal of his loan spell, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Millwall. Clark wanted to keep Thomas for the 2013‚Äì14 season, but questioned whether a deal was \\"doable\\" because of the transfer fee required. Rotherham United On 14 January 2014, Thomas signed for Rotherham United until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee. He scored 6 goals in 16 appearances as Rotherham gained promotion to the Championship, but turned down an offer to stay with the club. Birmingham City return Thomas signed a two-year contract with Birmingham on 11 June 2014. He made his second debut in the starting eleven for the opening-day defeat at Middlesbrough, and his powerful header against Brighton & Hove Albion on 16 August ended Birmingham's 18-game winless run at home in the league. After Gary Rowett replaced Clark as manager, his preference for selecting Clayton Donaldson as lone striker in a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation meant Thomas's appearances came mostly from the bench. Early in the 2014‚Äì15 season, after scoring two poacher's goals as Birmingham beat Gillingham in the second round of the League Cup, he admitted he found the situation frustrating. He was released by Birmingham when his contract expired at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. =Swindon Town (loan)= On the 2015 summer transfer deadline day, Thomas joined League One club Swindon Town on loan until January 2016. He scored twice from four league matches in September, but then injured a hamstring and was out for several weeks. Because Swindon's first-team squad contained eight loanees ‚Äì the rules allow a maximum of five in the matchday squad ‚Äì he played only twice more after he returned to fitness in what remained of his loan spell. =Bradford City (loan)= Thomas signed a 93-day emergency loan deal with League One club Bradford City on 29 January 2016. He made his debut as a half-time substitute in the next day's League One match at home to Fleetwood. With the scores level in stoppage time, Thomas's shot was pushed onto the crossbar by Fleetwood's goalkeeper and Steve Davies touched home the rebound for a late winner. He played in ten matches, opening the scoring in a losing cause at home to Colchester United for his only Bradford goal, up to 19 March, but made no further appearances before the end of his loan. Oxford United Thomas signed a two-year contract with Oxford United, newly promoted to League One, on 25 June 2016. He scored his first goal for the club on his league debut, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Chesterfield on the opening day of the 2016‚Äì17 season. In a game against Coventry City in November, he ruptured his Achilles tendon and missed the rest of the season. In 2017‚Äì18 he scored 11 goals (10 in the league) and was joint top-scorer with James Henry, but was released at the end of the season, having scored 15 goals for the club in 57 appearances in all competitions over his two seasons. Grimsby Town On 17 August 2018, Thomas signed a one-year contract with League Two club Grimsby Town. He was released by Grimsby at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. Notts County On 12 August 2019, Thomas signed for Notts County.

Overture-Fantasia, Op. 67 Tchaikovsky wrote the Hamlet overture-fantasia, Op. 67, between June and 19 October 1888, overlapping the scoring of his Fifth Symphony. The idea of a Hamlet overture had first occurred to Tchaikovsky in 1876, as outlined in his plans in a letter to his brother Modest. At that time, he conceived it in three parts: : 1. Elsinore and Hamlet, up to the appearance of his father's ghost : 2. Polonius (scherzando) and Ophelia (adagio), and : 3. Hamlet after the appearance of the ghost. His death and Fortinbras. However, by 1888 he had altered these notions. The actor Lucien Guitry asked him to write some incidental music for a production of Shakespeare's play, to which Tchaikovsky agreed. The planned performance was cancelled, but Tchaikovsky decided to finish what he had started, in the form of a concert overture. There is no musical enactment of the events of the play, or even a presentation of the key characters. The work adopts the same scheme he used in his other Shakespeare pieces, the fantasy- overture Romeo and Juliet (1869, revised 1870 and 1880) and the symphonic fantasy The Tempest (1873), in using certain characteristics or emotional situations within the play. The essence of the work is the brooding atmosphere depicting Elsinore, but there is an obvious love theme, and a plaintive melody on the oboe can be seen to represent Ophelia. What makes \\"Hamlet\\" unique from other works of Tchaikovsky fantasy is the lack of a structural development. The standard form of this music has an exposition, a development, and concludes with a recapitulation. Tchaikovsky did not clearly emphasize a development section in \\"Hamlet.\\" There is no section that fulfills the duties of a development, causing \\"Hamlet\\" to be a unique piece that is of linear, not symmetrical, structure. The Hamlet overture-fantasia was dedicated to Edvard Grieg, whom Tchaikovsky had met in Leipzig in early 1888 on the same occasion that he met Johannes Brahms. He described Grieg as \\"an extraordinarily charming man\\". The Symphony No. 5 was premiered on 17 November 1888, and the Hamlet overture-fantasia had its first performance a week later, on 24 November. Both performances were in Saint Petersburg, and Tchaikovsky conducted both of them. While Hamlet was not a great success, it still received a better initial reception than the symphony did, but it has subsequently assumed a lower profile in Tchaikovsky's works. Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman. Incidental music, Op. 67a Lucien Guitry again asked Tchaikovsky to write incidental music for Hamlet. This time, it was for a benefit production on 21 February 1891 at the Mikhaylovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, and it was to be Guitry's farewell performance. Tchaikovsky started work on the incidental music on 13 January, but found it difficult. He was exhausted from completing The Queen of Spades, which had premiered to a triumph in December 1890. Also that month, his patroness Nadezhda von Meck had severed her connection with him. He was also suffering an affliction of the right hand. For these reasons he had cancelled his conducting engagements in Mainz, Budapest and Frankfurt, and retired for rest and recuperation to Frolovskoye. For the overture, he used the earlier stand-alone Hamlet overture-fantasia Op. 67, but in a shortened form. In the 16 other numbers, as well as writing some new music, he also used material from the incidental music to The Snow Maiden, Op. 12 (1873), from the alla tedesca movement of the Third Symphony (1875), and from the Elegy for Ivan Samarin (1884). The writing was finished by 3 February. Tchaikovsky travelled from Moscow to attend the performance in Saint Petersburg. He enjoyed the performance for the acting, but he never thought much of the music he had produced, and refused permission for it to be used in a later production in Warsaw. The complete incidental music has been released on compact disc and in MP3 form.

It is a -story brick structure with a three-story entrance tower on the east end. The walls of the main section were built in 1765, and the tower was added in 1888. It is one of the first organized Presbyterian Churches established in America. In 1672, a group of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who had settled on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, petitioned the Grand Jury of Somerset County for a civil permit to hold services of worship and to have their own minister. The permission was granted, and Robert Maddox was called by the Grand Jury to preach on the third Sunday of each month, at the home of Christopher Nutter, 'at the head of the Manokin River,' the present site. In 1680 a request was sent by Colonel Stevens of Rehobeth to the Presbytery at Laggan, Ireland, for an ordained minister, and three years later, in answer to that request, the Reverend Francis Makemie, a 25-year-old, recently ordained minister, arrived in Somerset County. Under his leadership, this church, and those at Rehobeth, Pitts Creek, Snow Hill, and Wicomico were organized. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Plot Brothers Tony (John Derek) and Jim Scott (Kevin McCarthy) enroll as midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. Jim, the older one, looks after the more impulsive Tony and helps him pass a difficult test so he can play football in the big Army-Navy game. The game, however, shows that Tony cannot follow the coach's directions and gets benched. After the game, Jim introduces his brother to his longtime girlfriend, Peggy Lord (Diana Lynn), and a rivalry soon develops over her affections. With the Korean War looming on the horizon, during training, Jim and Tony are assigned to the same aircraft carrier. Jim continues to look out for his younger brother, even risking his own life. During a maneuver at sea involving helicopter and naval jets, Tony's aircraft plummets off the deck in an aborted takeoff and he is knocked unconscious. Jim dives from a helicopter into the sea to rescue his brother. When Tony is sent to the Naval Academy hospital to recuperate, he resumes courting Peggy and asks her to marry him. Peggy turns him down and is torn between the two brothers because Jim had already asked her to marry, and she had put him off until after the Korean War is over. After graduation, the two brothers are no longer close. As they begin advance training as jet pilots at the Pensacola Naval Station, Tony attempts to patch up the relationship, but Jim rebuffs him. Assigned to an aircraft carrier overseas, Tony and Jim end up on leave in Tokyo, where Tony meets Peggy, who tells him that it is Jim whom she really loves. He finally accepts the situation, and when he has the chance to make amends, Tony not only rescues his older brother during a dangerous mission, but also courageously fights off an enemy fighter during the rescue attempt. Checking on his wounded brother, he sees Peggy is there already and that Jim and Peggy will be happy together.

Hampered by budgetary constraints and even a minor rebellion from star John Derek, who insisted on switching roles with Kevin McCarthy at the last moment, Siegel made a number of compromises, using his former background as an editor for major studios to advantage. Siegel, as a freelance director, was able to sell his working approach of bringing in productions on a tight budget. He would plan out scenes meticulously and worked quickly getting the exact shots he wanted, with very few extra takes. With An Annapolis Story, the Siegel touch began with a finalized script, principal photography matched carefully to stock footage and a product that came in on budget and on time.Doll, Susan. \\"Articles: 'An Annapolis Story' (1955).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Its mission statement is \\"To be the leading advocate for the promotion and protection of hunting, fishing and trapping as well as the conservation of, and access to, fish and wildlife habitats.\\" History and mission In the 1930s, Jay Norwood Darling, the force behind the Federal Wildlife Restoration Program, was touring the country urging sportsmen and women to unite in order to protect local habitats and the future of outdoor sports. A small group of foresighted New Hampshire sportsmen heeded this call and the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation was born, founded in 1933 as the Federated Sportsmen's Club of New Hampshire. Shortly thereafter, a national movement of all the state groups that started under Darling met in Washington, DC and in 1963 became affiliated with the new National Wildlife Federation. NHWF remained affiliated with the NWF until 2005, when policy differences led to the NHWF disaffiliating from the NWF. The name of the organization was changed to the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation sometime in the early 1970s. NHWF was organized as a 501(c)4 non-profit organization at that time, but became a 501(c)3 in 2001. The mission of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation has been revised several times over the years. The current mission reads: \\"To be the leading advocate for the promotion and protection of hunting, fishing and trapping as well as the conservation of, and access to, fish and wildlife habitats.\\" NHWF is governed by a Board of Directors composed of fifteen Directors, four Officers (President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary), and the Immediate Past President. Affiliated clubs and organizations are entitled to two voting delegates and two alternates. It is these delegates and the board of Directors who set policies for NHWF. The Board of Directors has fiduciary responsibilities and the obligation to carry out established policy. The Board of Directors is responsible for the hiring and supervision of the executive director. For many years, NHWF was strictly a volunteer organization. In the late 1970s, Dr. Joseph Ezyk, an economics professor at Saint Anselm College and a dedicated sportsman, realized that to be a serious force in the conservation movement, NHWF needed to be revitalized. It was at about this time that the dam at Sewall's Falls in Concord, New Hampshire breached and an outstanding fishery was discovered. Dr. Ezyk and a few other dedicated volunteers hired an Executive Director (Bob Carlson), re-established the organizations newspaper, visited sporting clubs and recruited members. Keeping rivers such as the Merrimack in Concord open and free flowing was the objective of the new NHWF. Among the accomplishments since those early years has been the Sewall's Falls project, stopping a dam at Livermore Falls, writing the legislation that established the moose management program and moose hunt, creating public access legislation that has been the only success in providing public access to the state's water, insisting that game and fishing season be set by the professional managers at the Fish and Game Department, not by the whims of the Legislature, allowing sporting clubs a voice in the selection of Fish and Game Commissioners, and keeping fish and game funds secure in the department and not siphoned to the general fund of the state. NHWF was also a key player in the establishment of the Non-Game and Endangered Wildlife division at Fish and Game and helped provide the initial funding for that program. NHWF has played an important role in establishing the new Land and Community Heritage Commission. Other programs NHWF helped establish include Operation Game Thief (now under the Fish and Game Department) and Becoming an Outdoors Woman of New Hampshire. NHWF co-sponsored the North Country Legislative Tour for six years, established the Hides for Habitats Program, and helped distribute 3,500 National Wildlife Week kits to every third, fourth and fifth grade classroom in the state. NHWF publishes a bi-monthly newspaper, New Hampshire Wildlife, and maintains this web presence. NHWF works very closely with other conservation groups such as the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, New Hampshire Audubon, The Nature Conservancy, NH Timberland Owners Association, and others. NHWF in the past has held seats on many state boards and commissions charged with oversight of natural resources such as the Forest Advisory Board, SPACE, Conte Wildlife Refuge Advisory Committee, Great Bay National Marine Estuary Advisory Committee and others. NHWF works closely with the NH Fish and Game Department and help sponsor many programs such as Project Wild and Becoming and Outdoors Woman. As an independent organization, NHWF is often in a position to be vocal and act as an advocate for department issues when the department, as a state government department, cannot speak out. In February 2009 the NHWF rallied sportspeople from across the state to organize and oppose NH House Bill 559 (HB559). The proposed bill was an attempt to remove the authority of the NH Fish & Game Commission, which helps the Executive Director oversee the affairs of the NH Fish and Game Department. Additionally this bill sought to force an animal rights activist onto the Commission under the guise of more broad representation. The House Committee responsible for Fish and Game, under Chairman Rep. Dennis Abbott voted 15-0 to \\"ITL\\" (inexpedient to legislate) or kill the bill. As of this writing, the bill still must go before the House for a vote. The NHWF and its supporters will continue its vigilance to make certain this bill does not move forward.

He was capped by the county in 1965, and was awarded a benefit season in 1973, which raised about ¬£7,000. All but two of his 523 first-class wickets came for Worcestershire; the others were obtained for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the very last game of his career. Carter‚Äôs batting was generally extremely poor, as evidenced by his career batting average of under five in both forms of the game, although he did play one significant ‚Äì if ultimately fruitless ‚Äì innings. In the 1963 Gillette Cup final against Sussex at Lord's, he came to the wicket with Worcestershire 133/9, needing 35 runs to win. In fading light, he and wicket-keeper Roy Booth added 21 before Carter was run out to end the match. Carter also played in a critical close finish the following season against Nottinghamshire, where he and Flavell managed to get home by a single wicket and virtually seal the county‚Äôs first Championship title.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, One Hundred and Second Edition (1965); p. 535 Carter did not make his debut until the age of nearly 24, when he played for Worcestershire against Oxford University in early June 1961, taking four wickets in the second innings. That was his only first-team appearance of the season, and County Championship appearances had to wait until 1962, when he became a regular in the side from mid-season onward, finishing with a more than handy 70 wickets at 22.07 apiece. He was in fact to exceed this aggregate only once, in 1971 when he claimed 79 successes. For the early part of his career, Carter was somewhat overshadowed by his more illustrious teammates Len Coldwell and Jack Flavell, but nevertheless managed to make many appearances, especially when his England teammates were injured or engaged on Test duties. In 1965, the year in which he was capped, he turned in a remarkable performance against Lancashire. Having come into the team in place of Coldwell, who had been injured, in the second innings Carter returned an analysis of 4.1‚Äì2‚Äì7‚Äì6, including a hat-trick, as Lancashire were dismissed for 55. Throughout the rest of the 1960s Carter was in and out of the eleven, with the nearest he got to being a regular in 1968, when he played eighteen times. For the most part he chipped in with useful wickets without producing anything really special. However, in 1971 he enjoyed his best season: in 27 first-class games he took 79 wickets at just over 30, but he also found the increasing importance of one-day cricket to his liking. Worcestershire won the John Player League that season, and Carter played all but one match in the campaign. He achieved career-best innings returns in both forms of the game during 1971: 7/61 in the Championship against Yorkshire at Dudley (the last- ever first-class match at the ground), and 5/27 against Sussex in the John Player League. Carter‚Äôs Worcestershire career came to an abrupt end midway through the 1972 season, and he was to play only one more first-class game, for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Kent in May 1973. This, Carter's only appearance in top-class cricket for a side other than Worcestershire, saw him end on the losing side: a second-innings duck saw Kent record an 8-run victory. He took only two wickets in the game, but they were not bad ones with which to bow out: he accounted for Colin Cowdrey in both innings!

April 9 is an important day for the Pancing Kittens, it is the anniversary of the birth of Jacob Kessler who was their most average member in its history. They perform in many parades in the summertime, such as the Walkerton, Bremen, LaPorte, New Carlisle and Indy 500 parades.

In 2014, they made it to state in Scholastic Class A with their show \\"Twisted Wonderland.\\" In 2015, the Marching Cougars performed Pale Blue Dot in Open Class C, where they had lost at regionals. The show was about the famous Carl Sagan speech \\"Pale Blue Dot\\" and his many quotable lines and moral quandaries about the universe. In 2016, they performed again in Open Class C with their show \\"Letters to Home\\". The show is a commemoration to the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Its story, however, is about a soldier and his many different stories of the war from boot camp, jazz clubs, writing letters to his wife back home, and eventually the death of our main character who valiantly fought and died on the battlefield. In 2017, they were moved to Open Class B, performing the show \\"Beneath The Surface.\\" It tackles the topic of daily life of humans in the 21st century and how we act almost robotic with the amount of media we consume. In the introduction, we have our set up for a bustling city with people running to get to where they need to go with little interaction amongst each other. The opener takes us to the fun life of the city with many fun jazz riffs and fast tempo wood wind, brass, and drum line features. The ballad goes into a person finally realizing that they are only human, and of how they consume so much media, but never stop to actually care for other human beings and realize the narcissistic ways of humanity and themselves. In the closer, it acts a resolution and positive ending and tries to show us that we don't need media to make us. The concert bands take place during the winter and spring, and jazz band and pep band play at the home girls and boys basketball games. In 2010 and 2011, the marching band won first place in the LaPorte Fourth of July Parade, led by Mark Belsaas. They also have played at the Indy 500 as well as Indiana and Purdue Universities.

At in length, the northwest section of the cave is the longest continuous lava tube in Oregon. While the cave's discovery in 1889 was officially credited to a pioneer hunter, the presence of obsidian flakes near the cave has led archaeologists to conclude that Native Americans knew about the cave long before settlers arrived in central Oregon.  Geology  The eruption which formed the Lava River Cave occurred about 80,000 years ago. The source is believed to be near Mokst Butte southeast of the entrance. The same volcanic flow that formed the cave underlies much of the Bend area and almost reaches Redmond, Oregon. However, the specific vent that created the cave has been buried by several younger flows.\\"Lava River Cave Geologic Site\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 20 November 2003. The Lava River Cave was created by lava flowing downhill from a volcanic vent. The lava flowed northwest from the vent toward the Deschutes River. The flow began as a river of lava flowing in an open channel. Eventually, a lava crust solidified over the top of the flowing lava. This formed a roof over the river, enclosing it in a lava tunnel or tube. When the eruption from the vent stopped, the lava drained out of the tube leaving a lava tube cave behind. After the cave cooled, a section of its roof collapsed. This collapsed section provided the entrance to both the uphill (southeast) and downhill (northwest) cave sections.\\"Lava River Cave - Commonly Asked Questions\\", Newberry National Volcanic Monument, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 20 November 2003. The area around the Lava River Cave receives about of precipitation per year. Over the centuries, water from rainfall and snow melt has seeped down through the soil and cracks in the cave roof depositing sand on the cave floor. Small rivulets of water carry the sand downhill, plugging the far end of the cave with sediment. As a result, it is unknown how far the cave actually extends beyond the sand plug.  Environment  The cave is south of Bend just off Highway 97 The Lava River Cave is located south of Bend on the east side of Highway 97. It is part of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, which is managed by the Forest Service as part of the Deschutes National Forest.\\"Lava River Cave Explore the Inside of the Earth\\", Lava Lands Visitor Center, Northwest Interpretive Association in cooperation with Deschutes National Forest, Bend, Oregon, 1988.\\"Lava River Cave Day Use\\", Newberry National Volcanic Monument, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 20 November 2003. The forest surrounding the cave entrance is dominated by large ponderosa pine trees with sagebrush, manzanita, bitterbrush, snowbrush, and chokecherries as the main ground cover. Along the short path leading from the forest floor down to the cave entrance, visitors will also find serviceberry, false Solomon seal, squaw currant, Oregon grape, and small willow trees. Animals common in the forest around the cave include golden-mantled ground squirrels, chipmunks, western gray squirrels, porcupines, weasels, pine martens, and mule deer. In 1991, park personnel observed a full-grown cougar run out of the cave entrance area, but that was a single sighting. There is also a wide range of resident and migratory bird species common to the area. Small resident birds include wrens, robins, juncos, thrushes, woodpeckers, sapsuckers, red-shafted flickers, and ruby- crowned kinglets. Larger birds include great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, vultures, and a few golden eagles. Forest Service biologists have identified several species of spiders, worms, centipedes, and millipedes that live inside the cave. There are also mice and bats that live in the cave year around. The cave's bat population is relatively small and the bats are very shy so visitors rarely see them. In fact, bats usually remain in hibernation until July, and when active they are nocturnal so they are asleep during the day when the cave is open. If a bat is sighted, the Forest Service recommended that it be left undisturbed. Waking it from hibernation is extremely stressful, and can cause the bat to die from the sudden expenditure of energy.  History  The presence of obsidian flakes near the cave has led archaeologists to conclude that Native Americans knew about the caves long before any pioneers arrived in the Oregon country. The first recorded discovery is credited to a local settler named Leander Dillman, who found the cave opening on a hunting trip in 1889. Legend has it that Dillman found the cave entrance while following a wounded deer. After its discovery, he used the cave to cool his venison. The cave acquired its name from a 1923 geology study published by Ira A. Williams. The study also provided the first map of the cave. In 1938, the highway department announced an effort to resume digging efforts originally started by Emil Long to extend the cave beyond the dirt choke. It was speculated the cave could go all the way to Benham Falls. In 1926, the Shevlin-Hixon Lumber Company donated the site around the cave entrance to the State of Oregon for a park. In 1981, the cave and above ground park area were acquired by the Forest Service as part of a land exchange with the State government.\\"Lava River Cave\\", Newberry National Volcanic Monument, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 20 November 2003. In November 1990, the cave was incorporated into the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. However, it is still managed by the Forest Service along with the rest of the Newberry monument area.\\"Welcome\\", Newberry National Volcanic Monument, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 18 September 2008.  Cave tour  Cave mouth seen from the Collapsed Corridor Lava River Cave runs in two directions from the entrance cleft. The main section runs gradually downhill in a northwesterly direction from the entrance, passing under Highway 97. This section of the cave is the longest known uncollapsed lava tube in Oregon.\\"Lava River Cave Trail -- Trail #3952\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 24 March 2004 The other section extends southeast from the entrance. This section runs toward the source of the flow so it has a slight uphill grade. This section is not open to the public because of loose rocks in the ceiling. The mouth of the cave is at an elevation of above sea level. At its deepest point the cave is above sea level. The cave's entrance appears as a large hole in the ground. At its mouth, the entrance trail drops suddenly over a jumble of volcanic rocks. This area is known as the Collapsed Corridor. It is the result of ground water freezing in rock cracks in the ceiling. Loosened rocks eventually fall. Over the centuries, the fallen rocks have accumulated into a large boulder pile. Since freezing temperatures occurs only near the mouth of the cave, most rock-falls are in this area. To get down the rock pile, visitor must descend 126 steps with handrails for safety. At the bottom of the stairs is a large cool chamber where winter ice fills cracks in the floor and ice stalactites often cling to the ceiling until June.Morris, Elizabeth and Mark Morris, Moon Oregon, Avalon Travel Publishing, Emeryville, California, 2007, pp. 423-4. After a short walk, the ceiling reaches a height of . At this point, the width of the cave is . This massive volcanic archway is called Echo Hall. The smooth walls are remarkably symmetrical so sounds echo in the huge chamber. In this section, remnants of the ancient lava flow's current can be seen molded in the tunnel walls. They appear as rounded over-hanging shelves and lateral markings etched in the walls. The end of this hall is about 1,500 feet (457 m) into the cave. At that point, the cave passes under Highway 97. The underground crossing is marked by a small sign post. Good view of the interior of Lava River Cave in Oregon showing intact wall linings. Sign towards the end of the cave warning visitors not to continue any farther. Beyond the Highway 97 marker, visitors enter an area called Low Bridge Lane. In this area, the ceiling drops to less than six feet (1.8 m). This section of the cave was created after most of the molten lava had drained out of the cave leaving hot gases trapped in the interior of the tube. These gases re-heated the lava tube causing the tunnel walls to re-melt. As re-melted rocks cooled, the walls were left with a shiny, glazed surface. There are also volcanic stalactites in this area of the cave. These formations are sometimes called lavacicles. They are found in two forms. Some are hollow cylindrically shaped soda straws, formed by escaping gases. The others are cone shaped drip pendants formed when re-melted lava dripped from the ceiling. At the end of Low Bridge area, the tube begins to narrow and the cave is divided into two tunnels with intermittent connecting passages. This is the Two Tube Tunnel section of the cave. Both tubes were probably active lava channels at the same time; however, the upper channel eventually drained into the lower tube as the flow subsided. One of the most unusual parts of the cave is the Sand Garden, located about 3,000 feet (914 m) from the entrance. Here the floor of the cave is covered with sand. The sand was carried into the cave by dripping water. The sand is fine volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Mazama 6,600 years ago. Rain and melting snow carried the ash down from the surface through cracks in the rock and deposited it on the floor of the cave one grain at a time. Occasionally, enough water leaks into the cave to create a pool. This allows the sand to spread out across the floor. At the Sand Garden, the constant dripping of water has carved spires and pinnacles in the sand. Since it takes hundreds of years to build these delicate sand forms, the Forest Service has fenced off the garden area to protect it. The 2,211 feet (674 m) of cave trail beyond the Sand Garden has a sandy floor. Along the way, the ceiling descends lower and lower until the sand fills the cave. The last 310 feet (95 m) of the cave was dug out of the sand plug by two men in the 1930s. Exploring this section of the cave requires visitors to crawl on hands and knees for much of the distance to the cave's end, and usually takes at least thirty minutes. The air temperature at the mouth of the cave ranges from about 32 degrees to around 45 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 degrees to around 7 degrees Celsius) depending on the time of year. Inside the cave, it is a constant 42 degrees (5.6 degrees Celsius). As a result, the Forest Service strongly recommends that visitors wear a warm jacket while exploring the cave. Lanterns can be rented at the visitor center above the cave entrance. Personal lanterns are also permitted; however, in order to protect the cave's fragile environment, they cannot have glass globes or use kerosene or white gas. Battery powered lights are best, but they must provide reliable illumination for at least one hour.

The station is located under 3rd Avenue at University Street, near Benaroya Hall, and is served by Sound Transit's Line 1\\\\. It is located between Westlake and Pioneer Square stations and has surface connections to buses operated by King County Metro and other providers. The station consists of two side platforms situated under street level, with two mezzanines connecting to the surface. It was designed in the style of high-tech architecture and includes several pieces of public art added during construction and later additions. Trains serve the station twenty hours a day on most days and the headway between light rail trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. The transit tunnel opened on September 15, 1990, and was used exclusively by buses until 2009. Along with all other stations in the transit tunnel, University Street station was closed from 2005 to 2007 for a major renovation to accommodate light rail. Link light rail service to the station began on July 18, 2009, and bus service ceased on March 23, 2019. Location University Street station is located under 3rd Avenue between Union and Seneca streets in Downtown Seattle; the area is part of the Metropolitan Tract, an area of downtown that is owned by, and was originally home to, the University of Washington. The area surrounding the station primarily consists of high- rise office buildings and some mixed-use development, providing 102,194 jobs and housing a population of 13,813 within a of 3rd Avenue and University Street. Major buildings in the immediate vicinity of University Street station include Benaroya Hall and 1201 Third Avenue (formerly Washington Mutual Tower) on the west side of the station and the historic Seattle Tower and Cobb Building on the east side. The Seattle Art Museum and the Harbor Steps are located two blocks west of the station at the intersection near 1st Avenue, above the Seattle Waterfront and Seattle Aquarium. The 5th Avenue Theatre, Seattle Central Library, Rainier Square shopping center, and Union Square are all located east of the station along 5th Avenue. History Early proposals The Metropolitan Tract, historically the northern boundary of downtown Seattle during its early decades, was offered for development shortly after the University of Washington moved its campus to the north side of Portage Bay (modern day University District) in 1895. The university's Board of Regents voted to lease the land to private developers in 1902, beginning a construction boom in the area under the direction of the Metropolitan Building Company. In 1911, Virgil Bogue presented a comprehensive plan for the city of Seattle, including a rapid transit system centered around a \\"trunk\\" subway under 3rd Avenue, passing through Downtown and the Metropolitan Tract, towards a new civic center in modern-day Belltown. The plan was rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, and the 3rd Avenue subway was unsuccessfully proposed twice in the 1920s. In the late 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee put forward a ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the Seattle metropolitan area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Seneca and Spring streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures led to the creation of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County. Bus tunnel A dual-mode bus stopped on the northbound platform at University Street station in 1994 Metro Transit began planning a bus tunnel through downtown Seattle in the 1970s, to be eventually converted to use by light rail trains. Metro approved the construction of a bus tunnel under 3rd Avenue in 1983, and chose the intersection of 3rd Avenue and University Street as the site of one of the tunnel's five stations. The station at University Street, replacing two separate stations at Union and Madison streets, would be excavated cut-and- cover and be completed by late 1989. Excavation of the downtown bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel boring machines used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling were found in the historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990. In March 1989, the first buses were tested in the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under scaffolding and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors. In 1994, the Seattle Symphony selected a city block adjacent to University Street station, used during tunnel construction for equipment staging and storage, as the site of their new concert hall. The building, later named Benaroya Hall, required the two-year closure of the station's 2nd Avenue entrance beginning in 1996. The entrance was re-opened in 1998, at the same time the new hall was inaugurated. Light rail The platform at University Street station, after its renovation for light rail In the early 1990s, a regional transit authority (RTA) was formed to plan and construct a light rail system for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion plan to build light rail under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would be incorporated into the initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 1999. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement. The downtown transit tunnel closed on September 23, 2005, for a two-year, $82.7 million renovation to accommodate light rail vehicles. The renovation included the installation of new rails, a lowered roadbed at stations for level boarding, new signalling systems and emergency ventilation. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, and Link light rail service began on July 18, 2009, from Westlake station to Tukwila International Boulevard station. Bus service within the downtown transit tunnel ended on March 23, 2019, due to the expansion of the Washington State Convention Center at the site of Convention Place station, which includes demolition of the north portal. The tunnel became exclusively served by light rail trains, while the remaining seven bus routes were relocated to surface streets and nearby bus stops on 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th avenues. Naming University Street station is named after University Street, itself named for the original campus of the University of Washington before it moved in 1895. Metro discussed renaming the station for the Seattle Art Museum after it moved to the area in 1991, but took no action. In 2012, Sound Transit adopted names for light rail stations in the University District, near the current University of Washington campus, including \\"University of Washington\\" and \\"U District\\" stations. The similarity between the three stations' names has led to public confusion, and calls to rename University Street station after Benaroya Hall or the Seattle Symphony. In September 2019, Sound Transit opened an online survey with six options to replace the University Street name‚ÄîSeneca Street, Midtown, Arts District, Downtown Arts District, Symphony, and Benaroya Hall. The Sound Transit Board adopted Union Street/Symphony as the station's new name in January 2020, after it had been recommended by a committee despite Union Street having no entrances to the station. The name was suggested as a cost- saving measure to match the existing acronym of the station (USS) in internal documents and software, which would cut the cost of changing the station's name from $5.3 million to $1 million. The name change was planned to take effect with the opening of the Northgate Link Extension, but the Sound Transit Board rescinded its decision a month later.

The station has two side platforms located below two mezzanines at the north and south ends of the station box: the north mezzanine is accessible through the parking garage of the Cobb Building at 3rd Avenue and University Street as well as the west side of Benaroya Hall at 2nd Avenue and University Street, connected through a level walkway underneath the venue; the south mezzanine is accessible from a single entrance located in 1201 Third Avenue near 3rd Avenue and Seneca Street. University Street station is approximately long, wide, and deep. The station is situated above the Great Northern Tunnel, a century-old rail tunnel, which passes under with a clearance of approximately . Both tunnels factored into the architecture of nearby Benaroya Hall, which has an auditorium that rests on rubber bearings to insulate from vibrations and a concrete slab to minimize sound. Art University Street station, like other stations in the downtown transit tunnel, is furnished with several pieces of public art integrated into its design by architect Mark Spitzer and lead artist Vicki Scuri. \\"The Beltline\\", designed by Scuri, runs along the platform and consists of colored granite arranged in patterns that highlight passenger amenities, including information panels and benches. The benches have computer-generated dot matrix patterns sandblasted into the seats. Some of the granite originally purchased for use in \\"The Beltline\\" originated in South Africa, then under a Metro-sanctioned boycott over its Apartheid policies; the discovery fueled a minor scandal that resulted in the resignation of Metro's executive director, while the granite would be replaced with another type. At the south mezzanine is Robert Teeple's \\"The Southern Lights\\", a series of fourteen LED screens that show animated symbols and phrases in a commentary on the increasing influence of computers in human life. The symbols range from human faces to animals and astrological signs; the phrases, displayed in both English and Spanish, are randomly generated from using sets of four words that allow for 1.2 million possible combinations. The north mezzanine has \\"The Northern Lights\\" by Bill Bell, a series of 24 embedded lights that form patterns when the eyes of viewers move rapidly from side to side. The patterns include images related to transportation and finance, including trolleys, airplanes, coins and the dollar sign. Two of the station's entrances and stairways are home to the silhouettes of and sentence-long quotes from Abraham H. Albertson, architect of the nearby Seattle Tower, and humanitarian activist Flo Ware. At the corner of 3rd Avenue and University Street is a pendulum clock known as \\"Hickory- Dickory Dock Clock\\", designed by Heather Ramsay with references to the nursery rhyme \\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\", including a brass mouse running up its side. The Benaroya Hall entrance to University Street station, built in 1998 for the new venue, is decorated with a series of art pieces by Erin Shie Palmer known collectively as the \\"Temple of Music\\". The walkway's walls are sandblasted with images that begin as an abstract musical score derived from Robert Fludd's \\"Temple of Music\\" and morph into pixellated patterns as it approaches the station mezzanine. The walkway's handrails are etched with Braille text and voiceprints, and end in sculpted depictions of a violin and a microphone. The station's pictogram, a pair of theater spectacles, represents the neighborhood's connections to the arts. It was created in 2009 by Christian French as part of the Stellar Connections series and its points represent nearby destinations, including Benaroya Hall, the Seattle Art Museum, the Central Library, and the 5th Avenue Theatre. Services A King County Metro bus and Sound Transit Link light rail train at the station, seen in 2010 University Street station is part of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which is served by Line 1 of Sound Transit's Link light rail network. Light rail trains run from the University of Washington campus to Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. University Street is the twelfth northbound station from Angle Lake station and third southbound station from University of Washington station, the line's two termini, and is situated between Pioneer Square and Westlake stations. Link trains serve University Street twenty hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am, and eighteen hours on Sundays, from 6:00 am to 12:00 am; during regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every six to ten minutes during rush hour and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of fifteen minutes in the early morning and twenty minutes at night. During weekends, Link trains arrive at University Street station every ten minutes during midday hours and every fifteen minutes during mornings and evenings. The station is approximately 35 minutes from SeaTac and three minutes from Westlake. In 2019, an average of 6,167 passengers boarded Link trains at University Street station on weekdays. In addition to light rail service, University Street station is adjacent to four surface bus stops on 3rd Avenue near its entrances, served by several King County Metro routes and three RapidRide lines: the C Line to West Seattle and South Lake Union, the D Line to Ballard and the E Line on Aurora Avenue North to Shoreline. The area is also served by two east‚Äìwest routes (routes 2 and 12) that travel towards First Hill and eastern Seattle. During light rail disruptions, King County Metro also runs a special route between light rail stations that stops on 3rd Avenue between University and Union streets to serve University Street station. From 2009 to 2019, several bus routes also ran in the tunnel alongside Link light rail. The final set of bus routes in the tunnel were divided into three bays by their outbound direction: Bay A was served by three routes heading north toward Northgate and the University District and east towards Kirkland (routes 41, 74, and 255); Bay C was served by three routes heading south through the SODO Busway toward Kent and Renton (routes 101, 102, and 150); and Bay D was served by one route heading east via Interstate 90 to Bellevue (Sound Transit Express route 550). The bus routes were relocated in March 2019 to new stops on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th avenues to serve the University Street station area.

Barrel chest generally refers to a broad, deep chest found on a patient. A person with barrel chested will usually have a naturally large ribcage, very round (i.e., vertically cylindrical) torso, large lung capacity, and can potentially have great upper body strength. It can sometimes be found alongside acromegaly (an enlargement of the acra resulting from excess levels of human growth hormone (HGH) in the body). It is most commonly related to osteoarthritis as individuals age. Arthritis can stiffen the chest causing the ribs to become fixed in their most expanded position, giving the appearance of a barrel chest. Barrel chest refers to an increase in the anterior posterior diameter of the chest wall resembling the shape of a barrel, most often associated with emphysema. There are two main causes of the barrel chest phenomenon in emphysema: # Increased compliance of the lungs leads to the accumulation of air pockets inside the thoracic cavity. # Increased compliance of the lungs increases the intrathoracic pressure. This increase in pressure allows the chest wall to naturally expand outward. Barrel chest occurs naturally in native people who live at altitudes of over 5500 m, e.g. the Himalayas or the Andes. These natives also have polycythemia and other accommodations for high altitude life.Ganong's review of medical physiology See also * Barrel * Pectus carinatum * Respiratory examination References Category:Respiratory system ","title":"Barrel chest"},{"id":"20318822","text":"Charles B.

The station is located under Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues in Downtown Seattle, near Westlake Center and Westlake Park. It is served by Line 1, part of Sound Transit's Link light rail system, and also connected above ground by buses at several stops, the South Lake Union Streetcar, and the Seattle Center Monorail. Westlake station consists of two underground side platforms, connected to the surface by entrances and a mezzanine level served by nearby department stores. It is situated between University Street station to the south, and the former Convention Place station to the north; Convention Place was only served by buses, however, and Capitol Hill station is the next northbound light rail station. The transit tunnel was built in the 1980s by King County Metro and opened for bus-only service on September 15, 1990. The tunnel was closed from 2005 to 2007 for a major renovation to prepare for light rail service, which began on July 18, 2009. Link light rail trains terminated at Westlake until the opening of the University Link Extension on March 19, 2016; the tunnel became train-only in March 2019. Trains serve the station twenty hours a day on most days; the headway between light rail trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. A second downtown tunnel is planned to be built in 2030, with a transfer at Westlake station for traffic continuing towards South Lake Union and Ballard. Location Westlake station is located on Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues in Downtown Seattle's retail and office district. The station is at the north end of Downtown Seattle, near the Denny Triangle area, and is within walking distance of the Pike Place Market Historic District. According to the Puget Sound Regional Council, the area within of the station has an estimated population of 15,171 people (in 12,995 total housing units, mostly in multifamily buildings) and approximately 91,055 jobs. The station and its entrances are adjacent to the Westlake Center shopping mall, Westlake Park, Pacific Place, the Nordstrom flagship store, and the regional flagship of Macy's (formerly The Bon March√©). Pike Place Market is located to the west of the station, while the Washington State Convention Center is four blocks to the east. Amazon is headquartered several blocks north of the station in the Denny Triangle area. History Background and earlier proposals The Pine Street area of Downtown Seattle was regraded for development from 1903 to 1906, as part of the citywide regrading program. The newly regraded area was part of urban planner Virgil Bogue's 1911 comprehensive plan for Seattle, envisioning a civic center to the north and several subway lines converging at the intersection of Pine Street and 3rd Avenue. The subway lines would continue outwards to serve the civic center, Capitol Hill, Downtown (modern- day Pioneer Square), and the waterfront; the stations would also include additional entrances from within department stores and other large buildings. The plan was rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, and a 3rd Avenue subway passing through the area was unsuccessfully proposed twice in the 1920s. The regraded area was developed into the city's retailing neighborhood in the 1920s, with the construction of large department stores for The Bon March√©, Frederick & Nelson, and Nordstrom on Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues. A second major rapid transit plan was proposed by the Forward Thrust Committee in the 1960s, to be built by 1985, and was put before voters. It called for a subway station on 3rd Avenue between Pine and Pike streets, designed with underground connections to major stores, would be served by two routes continuing north to Ballard (via Lower Queen Anne) and Lake City (via Capitol Hill and the University District). The ballot measure required a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, but failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968; a second attempt in 1970 yielded the same result, ending the planned system. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures led to the creation of Metro Transit in 1972, who were tasked with operating bus service across King County and planning for a regional rapid transit system. Bus tunnel A dual-mode bus on route 107 at Westlake station just after the station opened, in 1990 Metro Transit began planning a bus-based transit system through downtown Seattle in the 1970s, including a transit mall, tunnel, or bus terminal in the Westlake area. Metro approved construction of a downtown bus tunnel in 1983, selecting Pine Street and 4th Avenue as the site of one of the stations. The station would be integrated with a planned shopping mall on Pine Street, with underground walkways connecting to nearby department stores. The Pine Street segment of the tunnel would be dug cut-and-cover and require a long-term closure of the street between 4th Avenue and 9th Avenue. SCI Contractors of Calgary was awarded the $74.5 million contract for the Pine Street segment, including the construction of Westlake and Convention Place stations, in February 1987. On April 27, 1987, Pine Street was closed to non-bus traffic, and construction of Westlake station's 400 pilings and outer walls began. Excavation of the tunnel on Pine Street was completed in late August, allowing for concrete pouring to begin. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the Christmas shopping season, from November 2 to January 4, at the request of downtown merchants; the excavated tunnel was backfilled and given a temporary surface for automobile traffic. A pair of tunnel boring machines arrived at Westlake station in the spring of 1988 after completing the 3rd Avenue segment of the bus tunnel; the machines were partially salvaged, leaving the outer shells in place to form part of the tunnel walls. Pine Street was re-opened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the opening of Westlake Center and Westlake Park. Excavation and concrete pouring in Westlake station were completed in December 1988, leaving major work on the mezzanine level left to finish. Westlake station, along with Pioneer Square station, was at the center of a controversy during its construction due to the use of granite from South Africa, then under a Metro boycott against Apartheid rule. After the granite's origins were discovered, the materials were returned and Metro's executive director resigned as a result of the incident. Metro also had to return shipments of terra cotta tiles that were delivered warped, in the wrong size, and in the wrong color; the planned terra cotta ceiling for the station was instead replaced with a travertine limestone. During construction in early 1989, approximately 20 workers were sickened by fumes and foul air inside the station. Air quality tests conducted in the tunnel could not identify the cause of the bad air, leading Metro to install scrubbers to help control diesel exhaust from equipment. The Westlake station mezzanine was opened on August 11, 1989, as part of a public preview of the tunnel. The station's design was praised by local politicians and visitors, with Seattle City Councilman George Benson noting that it had \\"an element of class that is new to Seattle\\". The mezzanine remained open for several weeks, allowing for access between the basement levels of downtown retailers, but closed until November for additional construction. Additional fire sprinklers were installed in Westlake station to accommodate parties and receptions, as the station's mezzanine became sought as an events venue. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and bus service began on September 15, 1990. Between 1990 and 2004, all service in the tunnel was operated by custom-built dual- mode buses, which operated on diesel fuel outside the tunnel and electrically as trolleybuses (via overhead wires) inside the tunnel. Light rail A Link light rail train arriving at Westlake station In the early 1990s, a regional transit authority (RTA) was formed to plan and construct a light rail system for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion plan to build light rail under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would be incorporated into the initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 1999, with plans to eventually add new surface entrances to serve the Washington State Convention Center in lieu of a Convention Place light rail station. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement. The downtown transit tunnel was closed on September 23, 2005, for a $82.7 million renovation to accommodate light rail vehicles. The two-year renovation included the installation of new rails, a lowered roadbed at stations for level boarding, new signalling systems and emergency ventilation. As part of the renovation, a short cut-and-cover \\"stub tunnel\\" was built under Pine Street between Westlake station and Interstate 5, forming a turnback area for trains and part of the light rail system's planned northern extension. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, with new signage, lighting, and street improvements; Westlake station was host to a public open house for the planned light rail system, featuring a light rail vehicle on display at the station prior to the re-opening of the tunnel. Link light rail service began on July 18, 2009, running from Westlake station to Tukwila International Boulevard station. A tunneled extension of the light rail system, from Westlake to stations at Capitol Hill and University of Washington, was excavated from 2011 to 2012. The northern extension opened on March 19, 2016, moving the line's northern terminus to University of Washington station. Bus service within the downtown transit tunnel ceased on March 23, 2019, due to the expansion of the Washington State Convention Center at the former site of Convention Place station. Westlake station became exclusively served by light rail trains, which are planned to increase in frequency when the Northgate extension opens in 2021. The Metro Customer Shop at Westlake station was also closed on March 6, 2019, ahead of the planned handover of tunnel operations to Sound Transit, and is planned to be replaced by another kiosk. Future As part of the Sound Transit 3 program, approved by voters in 2016, Westlake station is planned to become a transfer station for a new light rail line serving South Lake Union, Lower Queen Anne, and Ballard, to open in 2036. The new line would continue south through a new downtown light rail tunnel to International District/Chinatown station, merging with the current line.

The station consists of two side platforms, a mezzanine level, and entrances from the surface; all three levels are connected by a series of elevators, escalators, and stairs. The mezzanine spans the length of the station, unlike other downtown tunnel stations, and includes separate entrances to the basement level of nearby department stores, including Macy's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and the Westlake Center. The mezzanine also has ticket vending machines that issue ORCA cards, and was formerly home to the King County Metro Customer Shop, which was located at the west end of the station. The non-retail entrances to Westlake station are located on both sides of Pine Street between 3rd and 4th avenues, and on the north side of Pine Street between 5th and 6th avenues. There is also a direct elevator from the mezzanine level to the Seattle Center Monorail terminus at Westlake Center. The platform level at Westlake station is below street level, while the mezzanine is below street level. Art and architecture Terra cotta artwork on the south wall of Westlake station, seen from the mezzanine level Westlake station was designed by Brent Carlson of TRA Architects to \\"give the impression\\" of a retail center's liveliness, and features heavy use of granite materials and Art Deco design elements. The station is also adorned with public artwork as part of the tunnel's $1.5 million art program, under the direction of lead artist Jack Mackie and program director Vicki Scuri. The south station wall has a collection of 1,264 handmade terra cotta tiles carved in the shapes of leaves, vines, and flowers; the tiles, designed by Mackie, are arranged from the mezzanine level downwards, as if forming the roots of Westlake Park above. Between the mezzanine and platform, Scuri's 40 ceramic tiles feature geometric patterns found in clothing and other garments. The station's stairways and surface entrances are inscribed with quotes from University of Washington professor Caroline Ober, artist Mark Tobey, and retailer Silas Munro. On the corner of Pine Street and 5th Avenue is a granite street clock shaped like a question mark, designed by artist Bill Whipple. The platform level houses three , porcelain enamel murals by Seattle artists Fay Jones, Gene Gentry McMahon, and Roger Shimomura. Jones's mural is an interpretation of Seattle's place as a port city, using bright colors to \\"bring sunshine underground\\"; McMahon's mural depicts the \\"glamour\\" of shopping, with \\"larger than life\\" figures against the Seattle skyline and a beach; and Shimomura's mural is a collage of American pop culture figures, including the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Alice in Wonderland, and Donald Duck, intermixed with imagery from East Asian cultures, including a samurai and geisha, in a celebration of the city's cultural diversity. The station's pictogram, a tiara, represents the neighborhood's playful nature. It was created in 2009 by Christian French as part of the Stellar Connections series and its points represent nearby destinations, including Pike Place Market, Victor Steinbrueck Park, the Paramount Theatre, and the Washington State Convention Center. Services Westlake is one of five stations in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which is served by Line 1\\\\. Light rail trains run from the University of Washington campus to Downtown Seattle, the Rainier Valley and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, using the downtown transit tunnel between Westlake and International District/Chinatown stations. Westlake is the thirteenth northbound station from Angle Lake station, the line's southern terminus, and second southbound station from University of Washington station, the northern terminus. The station is located between Capitol Hill and University Street stations. Line 1 trains operate for twenty hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am, and eighteen hours on Sundays, from 6:00 am to 12:00 am. During regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every six to ten minutes during and between peak periods, respectively, with longer headways of fifteen minutes in the early morning and twenty minutes at night. During weekends, Line 1 trains arrive every ten minutes during daytime hours and every fifteen minutes during early mornings and evenings. The station is approximately 38 minutes from SeaTac/Airport station and six minutes from University of Washington station. In 2019, an average of 12,680 passengers boarded Link trains at Westlake station on weekdays; it is the busiest station in the Link light rail system. In addition to light rail, Westlake station is in close proximity to several other regional and local transit services. The Seattle Center Monorail, serving the Seattle Center and Space Needle, terminates at a station located on the third floor of the Westlake Center shopping mall, connected directly to the tunnel station via an elevator and stairway. The South Lake Union Streetcar terminates one block north of the station at McGraw Square, continuing to the South Lake Union neighborhood. Westlake station is also adjacent to several surface bus stops, served by King County Metro, Sound Transit Express, and Community Transit routes. Bus stops on Pine and Pike streets serve local routes headed east to Capitol Hill, Montlake, and Madison Park. Bus stops on 3rd Avenue serve RapidRide routes and local routes heading north to Ballard, Fremont, and South Lake Union, and south towards West Seattle, the Rainier Valley, and SoDo. Bus stops on 2nd Avenue, 4th Avenue, 5th Avenue, Olive Way, and Stewart Street serve regional express routes to Snohomish County, the Eastside, southern King County, and Pierce County. From 2009 to 2019, several bus routes also ran in the tunnel alongside Link light rail. The final set of bus routes in the tunnel were divided into three bays by their outbound direction: Bay A was served by three routes (routes 41, 74, and 255) heading north toward Northgate and the University District and east towards Kirkland; Bay C was served by three routes (routes 101, 102, and 150) heading south through the SODO Busway toward Kent and Renton; and Bay D was served by one route (Sound Transit Express route 550) heading east via Interstate 90 to Bellevue. Bay A was located on the northbound platform, while Bays C and D shared the southbound platform. The bus routes were relocated in March 2019 to new stops around the Westlake station area on various streets. King County Metro runs a special route, the Route 97 Link Shuttle, between all Link light rail stations during service disruptions, stopping at Pine Street and 5th Avenue to serve Westlake station.

The estimated terrain elevation is 122 meters above sea level. Saint Ignatius De Loyola is the patron saint of the barangay, which celebrates its annual fiesta every 31 July, which is notable because it was the day the society of Jesus, best known as the Jesuits, was founded. Etymology The barrio acquired its name from the plants that are growing abundantly in the area - the pandan plants (Pandanus amaryllifolius). These plants are used, until now, to add aromatic and exotic scents in most delicacies and rice cooking. Historical background The history of Pandan starts off in exactly the same way as those of most areas in the Philippines and it can go as far back as the Spanish occupation of the country. The history starts in 1796 when the entire province was claimed by Don Angel de Miranda in search of a new settlement. They cleared out a part of the woods and made the area suitable for farming. In 1899, when the American forces arrived, the inhabitants of Pandan were among the Filipino soldiers who defended Angeles, a battle which lasted three whole months. Despite the battle between the Filipinos and Americans during the latter‚Äôs first arrival, these men fought side by side during the second World War. The late part of the 18th century was the founding of another barrio in Angeles. Through the initiative of the late Don Jose ‚ÄúPepe‚Äù Henson, together with Don Clemente N. Dayrit Sr. Barangay Pandan was born. The forefathers decided to clear the area and cultivate it to make it more productive and suitable for growth. With the eighty-one pioneers that established residence in the area, it has grown to a blooming number of 17,895 residences in the barrio‚Äôs population projection for 2011.

Armsey (December 13, 1917 - November 2, 2008) was an American who served as an executive at the Ford Foundation where he oversaw the distribution of nearly a half billion dollars in grants. Through his efforts in the 1960s, the foundation denied grants to segregated universities, leading to the admission of the first black students at several major universities in the United States.Staff. Obituary: James Armsey, The News-Gazette, November 11, 2008. Accessed November 20, 2008. Early life Armsey was born in Olney, Illinois on December 13, 1917 and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in 1941. He served for five years in the United States Army during World War II as a public relations officer at various posts in the United States and in New Delhi in the India-Burma Theater, and left the Army with the rank of Major. After his military service, he returned to the University of Illinois was awarded a master's degree in political science in 1946.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"James Armsey Dies at 90; Oversaw College Grants\\", The New York Times, November 19, 2008. Accessed November 20, 2008. Career He was director of public relations at the Illinois Institute of Technology from 1947 to 1952 under the Institute's president Henry T. Heald, and was assistant to the Chancellor of New York University from 1952 to 1956 when Heald moved there. When Dr. Heald took a position with the Ford Foundation, Armsey followed him again. Armsey was at the Ford Foundation until 1975, in a variety of positions, including as director of its programs in higher education, journalism and public broadcasting. The programs he oversaw distributed grants from the foundation totaling $497 million in foundation grants. From 1960 to 1967, Armsey was the director of the higher education programs, which gave grants to colleges and universities with few strings attached, other than requirements than the schools raising matching funds from other sources. These grants, which gave $362 million to colleges and universities during this period, were some of the largest offered at the time. The grants included $220 million to 16 private universities, $125 million to a group of 68 liberal arts colleges and $13 million to 13 historically black colleges and universities. In discussions with the Ford Foundation's President Henry T. Heald in 1962, Armsey urged that the colleges and universities that were recipients of the organization's grants should be required to admit black students. The foundation's board approved the proposal. the new policy was not announced publicly, and all notifications of the affected schools were done in private. As a result of these changes, several schools that had been effectively segregated admitted their first black undergraduate students, including Duke University, Emory University, Tulane University, Vanderbilt University and a number of major private colleges. The Foundation initiated a program in 1968 with the goal of preparing minority students to become college instructors. Directed by Armsey, the program offered grants to Native American and Mexican-American students studying for doctoral degrees, and was later expanded to include black students. Grants offered through the program totaled $36 million. Death Armsey died at age 90 on November 2, 2008 at his home in Urbana, Illinois.

Strayhorn biographer David Hajdu notes that \\"[u]nlike conventional tune-based pop and jazz numbers of the day, 'Chelsea Bridge' is 'classical' in its integration of melody and harmony as an organic whole.\\" He also observes that it \\"vividly evokes the water below\\" the bridge rather than the bridge itself and that the piece is indebted to the work of Claude Debussy. Hajdu also quotes noted jazz arranger and composer Gil Evans as saying, \\"From the moment I first heard 'Chelsea Bridge,' I set out to try to do that. That's all I did ... tried to do what Billy Strayhorn did.\\"Hajdu, David, Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1996, pp. 87-89. In an analysis of the piece's haunting melody, Gunther Schuller writes: \\"What Strayhorn exploited in the theme of 'Chelsea Bridge' is the duality of its chromatic harmonies. The theme is set in its first three bars in minor sixth chords with an added major seventh. However, Strayhorn causes us to hear these harmonies as if they were whole-tone chords. He achieves this effect by two means: 1) through orchestrational and dynamic stressing of the three upper notes [and] 2) by setting these sixth chords in their third inversions. This latter device takes away the rootedness of the harmonies, letting them float, so to speak, more towards the top of their structure.\\"Schuller, Gunther, The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930-1945, Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 135. The piece was originally recorded by the Duke Ellington orchestra on 2 December 1941, with Strayhorn (rather than Ellington himself) on piano and solos by tenor saxophonist Ben Webster and valve trombonist Juan Tizol. It has since been recorded by Webster several times, including with Gerry Mulligan in 1959, as well as by Vince Guaraldi (1956), Joe Henderson (1967), Kenny Burrell (1975), Bobby Hutcherson (1988), Lew Tabackin (1989), Joe Lovano (1994), Ahmad Jamal (1995), Andr√© Previn (1999 and live in 2000), Keith Jarrett (1999), and Wynton Marsalis (1999), among many others. Strayhorn himself returned to the piece, recording it as an unaccompanied piano solo on his 1961 album The Peaceful Side. Another version appears on the posthumously released album Lush Life, issued by the Red Baron label. In 1958, lyrics were written for the song by Bill Comstock, a member of The Four Freshmen for the group's album Voices in Latin. Ella Fitzgerald recorded a wordless vocal version with Ellington on her albums Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook (1957) and Ella and Duke at the Cote D'Azur (1967), and it has also been recorded by other vocalists such as Sarah Vaughan (1979), Cassandra Wilson (1991), and Dianne Reeves with Daniel Barenboim (1998). According to Ellington biographer James Lincoln Collier, during a trip to Europe, Strayhorn was inspired by a J. M. W. Turner or James McNeill Whistler painting of Battersea Bridge and perhaps mistakenly named the song after Chelsea Bridge.\\"Chelsea Bridge\\" at Jazz Standards References / External links Category:1941 songs Category:Songs with music by Billy Strayhorn Category:1940s jazz standards Category:Lena Horne songs ","title":"Chelsea Bridge (song)"},{"id":"20319166","text":"The Butler Bulldogs football program is the intercollegiate American football team for Butler University located in the U.S. state of Indiana.

The team possesses a storied tradition that includes a national championship, and holds a record 19 Ivy League Football Championships with 11 College Football Hall of Fame inductees. After Dartmouth formally entered the Ivy League in 1956, head coach Bob Blackman led the 1962 team to the program's first undefeated season since the 1925 national championship team. Blackman also had his first All-American player in Donald McKinnon, class of 1963, who anchored a strong defense that allowed only six points in its first five games. History The sport of football, in its embryonic form, was played on the campus as early as 1876. Goalposts were erected on the green where they stood for several months, before being removed for the 1877 commencement. The first intercollegiate game occurred on November 16, 1881, when Amherst traveled to Dartmouth. The Green won with a score of 1‚Äì0. On November 21, the teams met in Amherst, Massachusetts for a rematch on Thanksgiving Day, and the scoreless game ended prematurely in a tie because of snow. In the following years, Dartmouth played games against some of the best teams in the nation. In 1882, Dartmouth played Harvard for the first time and lost, 53‚Äì0.

During that period, the Big Green secured eight conference championships, all of them outright except one shared with MIT in 1888.Triangular Football League Championships, College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved March 14, 2009. From 1901 to 1909, Dartmouth compiled a 58‚Äì9‚Äì7 record under several different head coaches. In 1901, Dartmouth played their first game against their intrastate rivals, UNH. In 1903, Dartmouth traveled to Harvard for the dedication game of their opponents' stadium. The Green, who had lost the first 18 meetings by a combined margin of 552 points to 18, upset the Crimson, 11‚Äì0. From 1911 to 1916, Frank \\"the Iron Major\\" Cavanaugh, led the Green to a 42‚Äì9‚Äì3 record. He volunteered for World War I at the age of 41, and was replaced as coach by one of his former players, Clarence Spears. Spears attained a 21‚Äì9‚Äì1 record with the Green, and went on to further success at West Virginia and Minnesota, among others.

The film enjoys cult status and is a dark comedic retrospect of the relationship between dissenters and the State Security Service under the regime of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. It was nominated for seven awards of which it received five.  Plot  In 2001, former professor of literature at Belgrade University, Teodor \\"Teja\\" Kraj is now a manager of a big publishing house. His workers are just about to go on strike, protesting against the privatization of the company, led by a man named Jovan. Teja satirically brushes off the workers' demands and continues to plan for a meal with his secretary and lover, Marta, to celebrate his 48th birthday. A strange man shows up at Teja's office carrying a briefcase and a large suitcase and insisting to speak with him. Teja reluctantly accepts, and the man claims he is a writer, presenting Teja with four books ready to be published. He implies the books contain classified information and says they were bound in secret by his daughter. They're interrupted by Jovan, who tries to get Teja to meet with the striking workers. He gets told off by Teja for brutishly yelling at Marta, and proudly admits to beating his wife. The mysterious man speaks with Teja about the books, collections of stories from the countryside and city life, a collection of speeches and a mysterious fourth book. Teja promises to read through the books and tries to send the man off. However, the man reveals he won't be returning, and that he's scheduled for a potentially deadly operation. He finally introduces himself as Luka Laban, a former officer of the State Security. He claims to have been following Teja for ten years, reporting on his movements on a daily basis. After Luka was retired in the aftermath of the 5 October Overthrow, his daughter compiled all his daily reports into four books, all listing Teja as the author. Luka reveals his daughter was Teja's ex-girlfriend Ana, who is now married in Canada, and wants nothing to do with her father. The film then presents several stories of how Luka managed to either observe Teja or, on some occasions, infiltrate his circle ‚Äì consisting of a fat, grumpy and drunk man named Maki, and a quirky, boastful and constantly injured man named Gipsani. In all of these situations, Teja was fighting against the Milo≈°eviƒá regime, and Luka was right behind him monitoring his movements. On several occasions, Marta and the striking workers enter Teja's office and misunderstand his and Luka's interaction as attempted murder or sexual advances. Luka first learned of Teja during the 9 March protests in 1991, where Teja held a speech. Luka observed Teja from a live camera. He suggested staging a car accident with Teja to his superiors but was denied. The film cuts to a scene in 1993 when Luka, posing as a newspaper salesman, was invited to sit with Teja, Maki and Gipsani at a kafana. Luka was a staunch communist at the time and loathed Teja for his anti-communist rants. When Teja narrowly avoided a fight with the other guests, he started hallucinating and left the table with talk of killing himself. Luka followed Teja to the bathroom and tried to hang Teja with his belt, making it look like a suicide, but narrowly missed his cubicle and almost hanged a different man. Teja doubts the validity of Luka's story since Luka references high art frequently. Luka replies that he acquired an understanding of art and philosophy by following Teja, and was completely clueless about everything other than the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin beforehand. He displays knowledge of a limp Teja has since his secret car accident in 1995 and reveals he was behind the wheel. Teja threatens to kill Luka but is stopped by Marta bursting inside. Luka ran Teja over two days following the Fall of Knin in August 1995, livid with the fact that Teja had been holding an anti-government protest in spite of the refugee crisis from Croatia. His protest was unintentionally ruined by Gipsani, who insulted the crowd by sarcastically defending Milo≈°eviƒá. At the hospital with a broken femur, Teja was visited by Luka posing as a doctor. Luka tried to provoke Teja, implying he had been working for a foreign power, and Teja bit off his ear. In the present, the two have a laugh about the ordeal. Luka then opens his suitcase and reveals it was full of ordinary things that Teja had lost during the last ten years, mostly when he was completely drunk. Luka tells Teja stories about the lost items. On New Year's Eve 1997, Teja received a set of binoculars from Ana, Luka's daughter, which Luka later picked up. That was the day that he found out that Teja and Ana, at the time a freshman in his class, were dating. Interrupting an interrogation of a protester, arrested during the 1996‚Äì97 protests, Luka spied on the couple in a strip club wearing a Santa Claus mask. At the strip club, Luka suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. At the hospital, he revealed to Ana that he had been following her relationship, and her attempt to secure a Canadian visa. There, he promised to Ana that he wouldn't murder Teja. He later followed and photographed Teja and Ana, and forwarded the photographs to Teja's university. Teja was kicked out for sexual misconduct and Ana suffered a nervous breakdown and dropped out. Luka became an alcoholic during this period. Luka suggests that he still considers it was worth it. Teja again threatens to kill Luka and is again stopped by Marta, who bursts in to inform Teja that the striking workers have blocked the street. While Teja steps out to confront the workers, we see Luka check on a recording device planted in Teja's office and contemplate turning it off. When Teja returns, Luka reveals he had been following Teja following his dismissal from the university and collecting his lost mail, particularly from his parents in ≈†id. Luka even visited Teja's parents, posing as a friend from the police academy of Teja's father's. We learn Teja's parents felt abandoned and lonely, as Teja never visited them. Luka shows him a toy dog that Teja got for his son when he visited his ex-wife in a bomb shelter during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Luka had already visited her and had shown her the photographs of Teja with Ana, making her leave Teja for good. Teja was being comforted in a kafana by Maki and Gipsani when he first met Marta who was sitting with her psychotic boyfriend. The boyfriend threatened Teja and his friends with a gun for exchanging looks with Marta. Marta secretly observes Teja and Luka reminisce over these memories, but is interrupted by Jovan, demanding Teja speak to the workers. Teja bursts into the room and knocks Marta over with the door. Thinking Jovan assaulted her, he punches Jovan in the face and tends to Marta. Jovan threatens him with a gun, and he is saved by Luka. It is revealed that Jovan is a State Security operative tasked with rousing trade unions under the code name Trotsky, and Luka uses his authority to call off the strike. Luka and Teja discuss how the murder would be portrayed as a suicide or a crime of passion, had Jovan killed Marta and him, and how the State Security was never really reformed as only Luka was sacked. Luka then tells Teja that this was, in reality, the second time he saved Teja's life. The first time was following his father's funeral when Teja and his friends grieved all night in a kafana with a hunters' club Luka had infiltrated. Teja drank all night and paid the band with his father's golden ring, which Luka returns to him in the present. On the train ride back home, Luka was in Teja and his friends' compartment with a fake mustache posing as a sympathetic conductor. Teja suddenly left the compartment to look for a toilet, and accidentally fell out of the moving train. Luka stopped the train and jumped out to save him, but the train left without them. Luka then carried an unconscious Teja back to safety, fearing Ana would think he killed him if Teja accidentally died. Luka reveals he is now working as a cab driver, and just wanted Teja to have the four books he brought and a play Teja \\"wrote\\", referring to a voice recorder Luka brought in his purse. Teja asks if Luka needed anything, and Luka presents him Ana's phone number in Canada and begs him to tell her they departed as friends. In the director's cut, we see the two were being watched by the State Security all along.  Cast  *Branislav Leƒçiƒá as Teodor \\"Teja\\" Kraj *Bora Todoroviƒá as Luka Laban *Nata≈°a Ninkoviƒá as Marta *Dragan Jovanoviƒá as Gipsani *Josif Tatiƒá as Maki *Miodrag Krstoviƒá as Jovan *Gorica Popoviƒá as a journalist *Renata Ulmanski as Teja's mother *Stole Novakoviƒá as Teja's father *Dana Todoroviƒá as Ana *Aljo≈°a Vuƒçkoviƒá as a waiter *Sergej Trifunoviƒá as Marta's violent ex-boyfriend Branislav Leƒçiƒá was intentionally chosen to play the role of Teodor \\"Teja\\" Kraj because he actively participated in overthrowing the Milo≈°eviƒá regime. Actual footage from the 1991 protests showing Leƒçiƒá giving his speech was used in the film.  Differences from the play  The film is a somewhat modernized version of the 1990 play. Most of the events the two main characters discuss in the play take place during the 1970's and 80's, and the earliest events described in the film take place in 1991. The entire subplot concerning the relationship between Luka's daughter and Teja is added in the film, in the play Luka has a son who is merely Teja's acquaintance. Another major point is the strike action subplot, the character of Jovan was added in the film and is based on the character of a raging writer barging into Teja's office after being declined by the publishing company. The relationship between Teja and Marta is more explicit in the film adaptation.

The team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and are members of the Patriot League. Fordham's first football team was fielded in 1882. The team plays its home games at the 7,000 seat Coffey Field in Bronx, New York. The Rams are coached by former Yale offensive coordinator Joe Conlin, distant relative to the late Ed Conlin, Fordham's all-time leading scorer in basketball who later played seven seasons in the NBA. History Fordham, then known as St. John's College, played its first official intercollegiate football game in 1882. The Rams beat Seton Hall 1-0 at home and followed that with a 2‚Äì1 road victory in New Jersey.http://www.luckyshow.org/football/Fordham%20football%20records.htm The points seem to represent goals as the game, even after Walter Camp's creation of a line of scrimmage and a system of downs, was very different during its early days. Scheduling too was different as the bulk of Fordham's early opposition came from local athletic clubs, military and naval units, YMCA groups and even its own reserve team. When up against other colleges, Fordham's main rivals were Xavier (a school that later dropped its college division but still exists as a high school and to this day is a rival of Fordham Prep), CCNY, Saint Peter's and Seton Hall. Fordham team of 1890‚Äì91 At around the turn of the century Fordham began to occasionally mix in more established universities like NYU, Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, Cornell and Syracuse to its schedule but, for the most part, it was still playing at a smaller level. Aside from a budding rivalry with cross-borough NYU, by the 1920s the bulk of Fordham's opposition came from elite Catholic schools like Boston College, Holy Cross, Villanova and Georgetown. Toward the end of that decade Fordham made a drastic jump to move up and play within college football's major level. Program changes included the hiring of Hall of Fame coach Frank W. Cavanaugh, a beefed-up, national schedule and a move from on- campus home games at Fordham Field (currently where the practice facility Murphy Field, softball diamond and tennis courts sit) to the 55,000-seat Polo Grounds. From 1929 until the program went on hiatus in 1942, the Rams reeled off 14 straight winning seasons and often played in front of capacity or near- capacity crowds. Rivals during this era included NYU, Saint Mary's (CA), Pittsburgh, Purdue, North Carolina and West Virginia. After the 1935 season United Press (later UPI) conducted the first-ever national poll. Fordham finished with a Top-20 ranking and followed that with six straight additional Top-20 (AP) finishes from 1936 to 1941. Only Duke also finished in the Top 20 in each of those first seven years of postseason polls. Fordham's best finish came in its undefeated 1937 season (7‚Äì0‚Äì1) when it ended the year ranked third in the country. Memorable victories during this era began with one over Boston College in 1929, ending the Eagles' 17-game unbeaten streak, still a school record. From there Fordham defeated NYU in 1930 in front of 78,5000 Yankee Stadium spectators for a contest that both teams entered undefeated. Other wins came against Detroit in 1931, St. Mary's in 1932, a big upset over Alabama in 1933, an even bigger one over Tennessee in 1934 and another win over NYU in 1935. That result cost the Violets a shot at the Rose Bowl. NYU returned the favor the very next season by upsetting the Rams and bitterly ending Fordham's \\"Rose Hill to the Rose Bowl\\" campaign. Further conquests included North Carolina in 1937, South Carolina in 1938 and Pitt in 1939. The Pitt rivalry began in 1935 when the teams settled for a scoreless tie. The squads exchanged goose eggs in 1936 and 1937 (when the Panthers won a national championship) as well in what was later dubbed the \\"Much Ado About Nothing to Nothing\\" series. After 13 straight scoreless quarters Pitt broke the drought with a second-quarter field goal in their 1938 encounter won by the Panthers, 24‚Äì13. After some revenge for Fordham in 1939, the Rams again beat Pitt in 1940 and later earned a trip to the Cotton Bowl. Two blocked extra points were the difference in their 13‚Äì12 loss to Texas A&M;, then the defending national champions. A win over TCU in 1941 set up a Sugar Bowl date against Missouri. In a monsoon setting, a first-quarter blocked punt through the end zone gave the Rams a 2‚Äì0 lead that held until the game's waning moments. The Tigers missed a last-minute field goal, and Fordham won by the lowest football score possible. Back at the Polo Grounds Fordham again beat Missouri, 20‚Äì12, in their 1942 rematch. Still, the season as a whole was only mediocre as Fordham finished 5‚Äì3‚Äì1 and for the first time ever, unranked. The era subsequently came to a close as football was suspended for the remainder of World War II. Prior to that the Rams had gone a combined 88‚Äì20‚Äì12 for a .787 win percentage during their 1929-1942 glory years. Over that same period of time only Alabama had a higher winning percentage in all of college football. Other milestones for the Rams included a 34‚Äì7 win over little-known Waynesburg to start the 1939 season. That contest was famous for being the first televised college football game. The following week, in a matchup between the era's two best, Fordham lost to Alabama, 7‚Äì6, in the second televised college football game. Both games were aired locally by NBC on an experimental New York-based channel called W2XBS that was available to only about 1,000 sets in the New York City area. Following the conclusion of World War II Fordham football returned in 1946 but on a deemphasized basis. National opponents were replaced with a more regional schedule and recruiting became more difficult as the school put more emphasis on academics. University president Father Robert Gannon SJ did his best to diminish the program. Claiming that having a top-level football team didn't provide any real benefit to Fordham, Gannon declared that \\"Fordham does not ever again want a football team rated rated among the nation's ten heaviest.\\" Gannon believed that sportswriters were \\"tyrants of tyrants\\" who believed universities only existed \\"to provide them with income.\\" His hope would not be completely fulfilled as, after three straight abysmal seasons, some pre-war greatness reawakened in 1949. Coincidentally, shortly after Gannon's departure from Rose Hill, Fordham jumped to a 4‚Äì0 record and was briefly nationally ranked before suffering a 35‚Äì0 loss to second-ranked Army. Dubbed the \\"Donnybrook on the Hudson\\" the game featured 23 unnecessary roughness penalties and several fistfights as, according to team captain Herb Seidell, \\"17 teeth came out of nine different mouths.\\" That loss aside, the Rams led the nation in passing and, at 5‚Äì3, experienced their first winning record since 1942. The 1950 team, which boasted wins over San Francisco and Syracuse, finished with an even stronger 8‚Äì1 record. During a weak period for the Eastern region as a whole however, Fordham remained unranked and was passed over during the postseason despite getting consideration from both the Orange and Gator Bowls. Early on in the 1951 national rankings Fordham did appear in the \\"others receiving votes\\" category but they were never again a bowl threat. The team combined for an 11‚Äì14‚Äì1 mark over the next three years although, thanks to the QB platoon of Roger Franz and Vinnie Drake, they did again lead the nation in passing in 1952. As seniors Franz and Drake (one of the first African American quarterbacks in college football) continued to put up prolific numbers in 1953 despite another losing season. The highlight there being a 20‚Äì0 shutout over Miami (FL) on Halloween Day, 1953 in front of 20,000 fans at the Polo Grounds. Up against a young squad depleted by graduation, the Hurricanes easily handled the 1954 rematch. In front of 37,000 Orange Bowl fans, Miami ran roughshod over Fordham, 75‚Äì7, the Rams' single worst debacle of the 1950s. Fordham finished the 1954 season at 1‚Äì7‚Äì1 and with crowds averaging under 12,000 per game while inside the cavernous but deteriorating Polo Grounds, administrators decided to drop the program. Back on campus and while calling the baseball diamond, Jack Coffey Field, home, students brought football back to Fordham at the club level in 1964. It again became a varsity sport within the small \\"College Division\\" in 1970 and was reclassified as a Division III program in 1973. The Rams qualified for the 1987 D-III playoffs and reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions, Wagner. 35 years after dropping big time football, Fordham finally regained Division I status (at the I-AA level, later renamed FCS) upon moving up in 1989. There the Rams began a dismal stretch of 12 straight losing seasons. Fortunes finally changed in 2001 as Fordham finished 7‚Äì4 under the leadership of head coach Dave Clawson. They changed even more so in 2002 when the Rams won their first ever Patriot League title, reached the quarterfinals of I-AA playoffs, finished 10‚Äì3 and earned their first season-ending national ranking (albeit this time at the I-AA level) since 1941. Fordham built on that achievement with two more Patriot League titles (2007 and 2014) and four more Division I Football Championship Subdivision playoffs appearances (2007, 2013, 2014, 2015). Each of those seasons also ended with Top-20 FCS rankings. Despite success under the leadership of head coach Joe Moorhead, including wins against FBS (formerly I-A) programs Temple and Army, Fordham is still best known for their famous \\"Seven Blocks of Granite.\\" It was a name given to the team's 1929/1930 and 1936/1937 impenetrable offensive lines. The 1936 team was coached by \\"Sleepy\\" Jim Crowley, one of the famed \\"Four Horsemen\\" that brought Notre Dame glory during the early 1920s. Aside from Notre Dame-inspired gold helmets, Crowley also brought an all-Notre Dame staff with him to Rose Hill. This included line coach Frank Leahy, who later returned to South Bend and became arguably the greatest college head coach ever. Vince Lombardi, who later became arguably the greatest NFL head coach ever, played for Leahy on that famous \\"Granite\\" line. Additionally, Fordham is credited with inspiring the term \\"Ivy League\\" after New York Herald Tribune sportswriter Caswell Adams compared the Rams to Princeton and Yale, two powerhouses of the day. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, that they were \\"only Ivy League\\" squads. Up until then what is now called the Ivy League was a loose collection of schools informally known as the Ancient Eight. Ironically, although Fordham shunned most Ivies during their glory years, since moving to the I-AA/FCS ranks in 1989, the bulk of the Rams' out of conference schedule has come against Ivy schools. Back in those glory days and again more recently Fordham has placed many players in the NFL. Their lasting mark on the pro ranks, however came in 1936. A club from a new startup league, the AFL, and based out of Cleveland, named themselves the Rams to honor Fordham. The Cleveland Rams jumped into the NFL the following season. Later, with competition coming from another new franchise from within another new startup league, the AAFC's Cleveland Browns, the Rams moved to Los Angeles in 1946. The team relocated again in 1995 to St. Louis where in 1999 the NFL's Rams won their first and only Vince Lombardi Trophy. They returned to LA in 2016 and are still the only NFL team named after a college one.

That team was also retroactively declared national champions by University of Tennessee physics professor, Soren Sorensen. However, according to a national poll conducted by Albert Russel Erskine, Notre Dame finished as the top ranked team. The Dickinson System, a math formula used at the time to rate college football teams, also gave the 1929 crown to Notre Dame. The Dunkel Index, another math formula, confirmed Notre Dame as the nation's top program. Other later math systems including Sagarin-ELO, Boand, Poling and Billingsley all retroactively backed the real-time assessments, as did Helms, the College Football Researchers Association and the National Championship Foundation. In fact, according to James Howell's Football Power Ratings (who also listed Notre Dame as 1929 champions), Fordham finished the season rated only 24th. The Rams finished as low as 48th according Sports-Reference (also having Notre Dame at the top spot) but there is no denying that, on the field, Fordham has a lineal claim to the 1929 title. It's a claim that is still occasionally referred to in the media despite the fact that the Ram teams generally finished with higher national ranking/ratings throughout the 1930s and early '40s. Long after those glory years, and as a non-varsity club in 1968, Fordham won a minor national championship. That success helped propel the team back to varsity status in 1970. In what would later be known as the D-III level, Fordham also reached the quarterfinals of the 1987 playoffs. That success helped propel the team over the D-II level entirely and into what would later be known as the FCS level in 1989. Fordham reached the quarterfinals of the 2002 FCS playoffs but that is the closest they have come to another national championship.  Regional championships  Fordham won the 1941 Lambert Trophy, an annual award given to the best team in the Northeast. The ECAC awarded the Rams with a similar honor as the Northeast's best FCS team in 2015.  Conference championships  Aside from brief memberships inside local D-III conferences (the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Conference in the '70s where the Rams won a league title in 1977 and the Liberty Football Conference in the '80s where the Rams won league titles in 1987 and 1988) Fordham has spent the bulk of their football existence as an independent. They then joined the Patriot League in 1990 and after over a decade of struggles, finally won conference crowns in 2002, 2007 and 2014. Each title earned the team automatic bids into the NCAA FCS (previously I-AA) playoffs.  Postseason play  Fordham vs. Navy at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, 2016 Over 60 years after their last major bowl game, the Rams returned to the postseason by knocking Northeastern out of the first round of the 2002 I-AA playoffs. A week later they fell to Villanova in the I-AA quarterfinals. Fordham fell to UMass in the first round of the 2007 playoffs. In the 2013 playoffs, Fordham defeated Sacred Heart in the opening round before losing to Towson in the Round of 16. They again beat Sacred Heart in the 2014 playoffs before bowing to New Hampshire in the Round of 16. They were defeated by Chattanooga in the opening round of the 2015 playoffs.

The Liberty Cup was instituted in 2002 to honor alumni from both schools who were lost in the attacks of September 11, 2001. The Cup also honored the thousands of others who lost their lives on September 11. Included in this, members of the various city, state and interstate agencies such as the FDNY, NYPD, local EMS and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Columbia called off the series before the 2015 season, making their already scheduled 2015 encounter (a 44‚Äì24 Fordham win), the Cup's last. The series ended with the Rams holding a 10‚Äì4 Liberty Cup lead and victories in the final six meetings. The all-time series dates back to 1890. Only three games were played (all Columbia wins) by the two schools from 1890 to 1990 and the overall record sits tied, 12‚Äì12. Holy Cross Crusaders Fordham vs. Holy Cross at Yankee Stadium, 2016. The Ram-Crusader Cup (on hiatus between 1955 and 1989) was instituted in 1951 to honor the memory of Major Frank Cavanaugh. The \\"Iron Major\\" spent three seasons as the head coach at Holy Cross (1903‚Äì1905) where he built a 19‚Äì10‚Äì2 record. Decades later he spent six seasons at Fordham (1927‚Äì1932) where he compiled a 34‚Äì14‚Äì4 record and also elevated the program to college football's highest level. Due to health concerns, Major Cavanaugh was relieved of his duties following the 1932 season and died in August, 1933. Holy Cross leads the \\"Iron Major\\" series, 19‚Äì15. The all-time series dates back to 1902, just a year before Cavanaugh began patrolling the Holy Cross sideline. The Crusaders also lead the overall series, 30‚Äì25‚Äì2. The 2016 game was played on November 12, at Yankee Stadium, where in front of 21,000+ fans, Fordham defeated Holy Cross by a score of 54‚Äì14. This marked Fordham's first game at The Stadium since 1946 and the first encounter between the schools at a professional venue since 1954.

Massachusetts is the fourth oldest program currently in FBS. The Minutemen currently compete as an FBS independent. UMass began play in 1879 and have since appeared in three FCS National Championship games, winning the title in 1998. The Minutemen began a two-year Football Bowl Subdivision transition period in 2011, becoming bowl eligible in 2013. In March 2014, the Mid-American Conference and UMass announced an agreement for the Minutemen to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass declined a full membership offer. UMass announced that it would look for a \\"more suitable conference\\" for the team. Possibilities included becoming independent or joining the American Athletic Conference, Conference USA, or the Sun Belt Conference. In September 2014, UMass announced that they would become independent beginning with the 2016 season. The Minutemen have subsequently played as an independent through the 2019 season. , the program's 12-game schedules through the 2022 season are fixed, 10 of 12 games are fixed for both 2023 and 2024, and at least three games per season are fixed out to 2028. On August 11, 2020 UMass announced the cancellation of the 2020 season, Athletic Director Ryan Bamford explained, \\"The continuing challenges surrounding the COVID-10 pandemic posed too great of a risk.\\" Then on September 21, 2020 UMass announced its intention to play a limited number of fall football games. History Early history (1879‚Äì1977) UMass began playing football on November 22, 1879, when the school was known as Massachusetts Agricultural College, and the team was known as the \\"Aggies.\\" They were first organized the previous fall by Francis Codman, but did not play their first game until November 22, 1879, defeating the Amherst College freshman team 4‚Äì0. As this was their only game that year, 1879 is noted as their first undefeated season, matched only by the 1889 season (2‚Äì0) and the 1963 season (8‚Äì0‚Äì1). Massachusetts later teamed up with Storrs Agricultural College (now the University of Connecticut) and Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now the University of Rhode Island) to form the Athletic League of New England State Colleges for the purpose of scheduling football matchups between the schools. The first meeting between the Aggies and each of the other schools resulted in a shutout win for Massachusetts, as they defeated Connecticut, 36‚Äì0, in 1897 and Rhode Island, 46‚Äì0, in 1903. Massachusetts won their 100th game on October 2, 1920, topping rival Connecticut in a 28‚Äì0 shutout. The team played their 1000th game on November 11, 2000, losing to conference foe Delaware, 19‚Äì31. The team's nickname has endured several changes throughout the years. Though the official nickname remained \\"Aggies\\", \\"Statesmen\\" was also used interchangeably beginning when the school was renamed to Massachusetts State College in 1931. The nickname was officially changed to the \\"Redmen\\" when the name of the college became the University of Massachusetts in 1947. Pittsburgh assistant coach Vic Fusia took over the Redmen football program in 1961 and under his tutelage, UMass compiled a record of 59‚Äì32‚Äì2. The Fusia era included an undefeated 8‚Äì0‚Äì1 campaign in 1963 as well as records of 8‚Äì2, 7‚Äì2, 6‚Äì3 and 7‚Äì2 in the following years. However, two losing records in three seasons led to Fusia's dismissal after the 1970 season. Denver Broncos linebackers and defensive backs coach Dick MacPherson, a former UMass assistant from 1959‚Äì1960, took over after Fusia's firing. Under MacPherson, the Redmen compiled a record of 45‚Äì27‚Äì1. In response to changing attitudes regarding the use of Native American-themed mascots, they changed their mascot in 1972 to the Minuteman, based on the historical \\"minuteman\\" relationship with Massachusetts; women's teams and athletes are known as Minutewomen. Bob Pickett era (1978‚Äì1983) Bob Pickett was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach of the Minutemen football program in 1978. Under Pickett's tutelage, the Minutemen won four conference championships and compiled a record of 36‚Äì28. Despite the successes, back-to-back losing seasons in 1982 and 1983 led to Pickett's dismissal. Bob Stull era (1984‚Äì1985) Washington offensive coordinator Bob Stull was the next head coach for UMass, and he led the Minutemen to a 10‚Äì12 record in two seasons before leaving the program to accept the head coaching position at UTEP. Under Stull, the Minutemen struggled to a two-win campaign in 1984 but improved to seven wins in 1985. Jim Reid era (1986‚Äì1991) Jim Reid was promoted from defensive coordinator following Stull's departure and led the Minutemen for six seasons, compiling a 36‚Äì29‚Äì2 that included five non-losing seasons during his tenure. Reid and UMass parted ways after the 1991 season. Mike Hodges era (1992‚Äì1997) UMass once again promoted their defensive coordinator, this time making Mike Hodges the team's head coach. Under Hodges, the Minutemen compiled a record of 35‚Äì30. Steady decline in the team's play that culminated with a 2‚Äì9 record in 1997 resulted in Hodges' firing. Mark Whipple era (1998‚Äì2003) In his first stint as coach of UMass from 1998 to 2003, Mark Whipple won the NCAA Division I-AA national title. His UMass teams rewrote the record books, setting more than 40 team records. The 1998 national championship team posted school records in points scored (524), touchdowns (73), total yards (7,074), passing yards (4,050), completions (306), and first downs (354). Whipple left college football for a position as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL in 2004. Don Brown era (2004‚Äì2008) In 2004, Northeastern head coach Don Brown returned to UMass, where he'd served as defensive coordinator from 1998‚Äì1999 to take over as head coach. During his tenure as head coach from 2004 to 2008, UMass posted the best five-year record in school history, 43‚Äì19. In his first year, he led the Minutemen to a 6‚Äì5 record, including victories over fourth-ranked Colgate, seventh-ranked , and ninth-ranked . During 2005, Brown helped UMass to a 7‚Äì2 start and a final ranking of #19. That year, the Minutemen defeated fourth- ranked James Madison and handed Delaware their worst home loss in two decades, 35‚Äì7. In 2006, Brown led Massachusetts to the Atlantic 10 conference championship and a finish as runners-up to the national championship. They ended the season ranked No. 2 with a 13‚Äì2 record. At home, he set a school record with a perfect 8‚Äì0 record in McGuirk Stadium. That season, Brown was named the AFCA Region I Coach of the Year, Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year, and New England Football Coach of the Year. In 2007, UMass again won its conference, now as a member of the Colonial Athletic Association. The team advanced to the semifinals and finished the season with a No. 6 final ranking.Player Bio: Don Brown , Official University of Massachusetts Athletics Website, retrieved January 10, 2009. Brown was relieved of his duties as head coach following the 2008 season. Kevin Morris era (2009‚Äì2011) UMass promoted offensive coordinator Kevin Morris to head coach following Brown's departure. Under Morris, the Minutemen compiled a record of 16‚Äì17. On April 20, 2011, after decades of studies and speculation, the UMass Minutemen formally announced they elevated their football program to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision and became a member of the Mid-American Conference beginning with the 2012 season. The announcement was made at Gillette Stadium, where the Minutemen currently play some of their home games. In 2011, UMass completed their last season in the Colonial Athletic Association, and were not eligible for NCAA postseason play. UMass played a full FBS and MAC schedule in 2013 and became eligible for the MAC championship and bowl participation. Morris was fired as UMass' head coach following a 5‚Äì6 season in 2011. Charlie Molnar era (2012‚Äì2013) Notre Dame offensive coordinator Charley Molnar was hired as UMass' head coach in December 2011. The NCAA made a formal announcement of UMass' admission to FBS in the summer of 2013 after the program met specified benchmarks over its two transitioning years. The primary criteria centered around average attendance, an increase in scholarships from 63 to 85, and specific scheduling requirements. The NCAA did announce that the team must meet attendance requirements or face a 10-year probationary period. Along with joining the Mid-American Conference the men's and women's basketball teams will play four non conference games against MAC teams.http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/images/upload/FBS%20FAQs_0.doc UMass struggled mightily under Molnar's tutelage, compiling back-to-back 1‚Äì11 campaigns in 2012 and 2013, the first two seasons UMass was a member of the MAC and FBS. Molnar was fired after two seasons as head coach. Whipple's return (2014‚Äì2018) Mark Whipple was selected as Molnar's replacement, returning to UMass after eleven years and stints in the NFL and college football as an assistant coach. In March 2014, the MAC and UMass announced an agreement for the Minutemen to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass declined a full membership offer.

The first game played between the two schools took place in 1899 and was played at a neutral location. Boston College won 18‚Äì0. At the time, UMass was known as Massachusetts Agricultural College. The relative proximity between the schools encouraged them to schedule additional matches in the subsequent years. BC and UMass met again in Amherst in 1901, 1902, and 1912, with UMass winning all three contests before the series was halted. The two universities did not meet again on the football field until 1966, when they began a seventeen-year series in which the teams would play each other in the last week of UMass' football season. UMass was in a lower division than BC during the entirety of the rivalry. As such, Boston College dominated the stretch, winning fifteen of the seventeen games, routinely blowing out the overmatched Minutemen. After 22 years, the rivalry was renewed as UMass traveled to Chestnut Hill to play Boston College once again. UMass was yet again outmatched, losing 29‚Äì7. The universities agreed to play two more times over the next seven years, and Boston College won both games easily. In April 2011, UMass announced plans to join the Mid-American Conference and move up to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of college football in the country. Boston College had been a member of this division for decades, and there was much speculation that the two schools may cultivate a renewal of the rivalry. This was confirmed when it was reported in September 2011, that they had agreed to play a three-game biannual series beginning in 2014.http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/09/26/jesse-julmiste-sets-umass-record- for-kickoff-returns Two of the games will be played at BC's Alumni Stadium and the other will be held at Gillette Stadium. Most recently, the two teams met in September 2018, with BC winning 55‚Äì21. {  - + UMass vs Boston College: All-Time Record !Games played !First meeting !Last meeting !UMass wins !UMass losses !UMass ties - center;\\" 27 1899 (Lost 18-0) 2018 (Lost 55-21) 5 22 0 } Connecticut The first game played between Massachusetts and UConn took place on November 6, 1897, in Amherst. UMass won 36‚Äì0. At the time, UMass was known as Massachusetts Agricultural College and Connecticut was officially Storrs Agricultural College. They had formed a loose association with other public colleges in New England such as present day New Hampshire and Rhode Island for the purpose of scheduling football matchups between the schools.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/conn/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2015-16/misc_non_event/part5-15.pdf The colleges continued to schedule matches intermittently until after World War I, when they began to play on an almost-yearly basis through the mid-1920s. The series was discontinued until 1932, when the schools again met each year until World War II saw both universities disband their football teams. The schools would not match up again on the gridiron until UConn joined Massachusetts in the Yankee Conference in 1952. UConn and UMass played every season from that point on until UConn began their transition to what was then Division I-A in 2000. UMass leads the all-time series 36‚Äì34‚Äì2. Massachusetts dominated the rivalry early, winning the first eight and 13 of the first 15 meetings between the two universities. Connecticut went on a streak of their own after that, winning 14 of the next 16 games. The 1960s again belonged to the then-Redmen of Massachusetts, as they lost only two games that decade. In the remaining years of the rivalry, the series was much more even, with neither team able to put together a winning streak of more than four games. In April 2011, UMass announced plans to join the Mid-American Conference and move up to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of college football in the country. Prior to this decision, the two schools had scheduled a game for August 30, 2012. UMass later became a FBS Independent school starting in 2016. In 2015, the two schools announced that the Minutemen will visit Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in 2018 and 2020, and the Huskies will visit Gillette Stadium in 2019 and 2021. {  - + UMass vs UConn: All-Time Record !Games played !First meeting !Last meeting !UMass wins !UMass losses !UMass ties - center;\\" 74 1897 (Win 36-0) 2019 (Lost 56-35) 37 35 2 } Facilities Alumni Field The first field that the Minutemen played at was called Alumni Field, and was situated on the south end of campus. This field was replaced in 1915 by a new venue, also called Alumni Field. It was replaced in 1965 by Alumni Stadium, and later became the location of the Whitmore Administration Building. McGuirk Alumni Stadium The Minutemen played their last home football game for three years at McGuirk Alumni Stadium, a 17,000 seat stadium on the UMass Amherst campus in 2011. The stadium itself sits just over the town line in neighboring Hadley. The inaugural game took place on September 25, 1965 when UMass defeated the AIC Yellow Jackets, 41‚Äì0. Since the opening, UMass has enjoyed a decided home field advantage, posting a 182‚Äì79‚Äì2 record when playing at McGuirk. The attendance record at McGuirk was set during a UMass football game against Boston College on November 25, 1972; 20,000 fans were in attendance. McGuirk was partially renovated for a return of UMass football. The expansion included a new performance center with new locker rooms and training facilities, and a new press box.http://www.umass.edu/fp/projectmanagement/constructioninformation/mcguirkalumnistadiumupgrades/ In the 2012 and 2013 seasons UMass played all their home games at Gillette Stadium, but they returned to McGuirk beginning with three games in 2014. Both venues will be used for home games moving forward. Gillette Stadium UMass first played at Gillette Stadium in the \\"Colonial Clash\\" against the University of New Hampshire on October 23, 2010. This game was renewed for the 2011 season as UMass played New Hampshire there again. For 2012‚Äì2013 the team played all of their home games at Gillette. Since then, UMass has split their home games between Gillette Stadium and the on-campus McGuirk Alumni Stadium.http://www.umassathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/FBS2.html Notable alumni NFL All-Pros and Pro Bowlers {  - -  Milt Morin  none  1968, 1971 -  Greg Landry  none  1971 -  Victor Cruz  2011  2012 } Current NFL players {  - -  Vladimir Ducasse  OG  Buffalo Bills  2009 -  Tajae Sharpe  WR  Minnesota Vikings  2016 -  Elijah Wilkinson  OT  Denver Broncos  2017 - Andy Isabella WR Arizona Cardinals 2019 - Isaiah Rodgers CB Indianapolis Colts 2020 -  Marken Michel  WR  Carolina Panthers  2015 } Individual awards UMass has had more than 70 players named to various All-American teams since Lou Bush garnered the first selection for the Minutemen (then called the Aggies) in the early 1930s.

The school's basketball teams had acclaimed fame throughout the 1920s by playing \\"racehorse basketball\\" and becoming one of the first schools in the nation to employ what is known as the fast break. Montana State College coach Ott Romney, who graduated with a Masters from MSC prior to World War I, pioneered the style of play, and by 1926 had assembled a team perfectly suited to playing an up-tempo brand of ball. Cat Thompson, John \\"Brick\\" Breeden, Frank Ward, Val Glynn and Max Worthington were at the heart of the MSC team that won the Rocky Mountain Conference title three straight seasons, and bested Utah State, BYU, Colorado, and University of Denver. The 1928‚Äì29 team reached college basketball's zenith by defeating the AAU Champion Cook's Painters in a two-of-three series and steamrolling to the Rocky Mountain Conference title. The Bobcats were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament national champion for the 1928‚Äì29 season by the Premo- Porretta Power Poll and the Helms Athletic Foundation. The Helms Foundation also named Cat Thompson one of the five greatest players in the first half of the 20th century in college hoops. Football In 1956 the Bobcats football team took a share of the NAIA championship in the Aluminum Bowl in Little Rock, Arkansas playing to a 0‚Äì0 tie on a muddy field with the Pumas of St. Joseph‚Äôs College from Rensselaer, Indiana. In 1976 the Bobcats of Montana State won a national football title in NCAA Division II at Wichita Falls, Texas beating the Zips of Akron, Ohio 24-13 in the title game. In 1984, the Bobcats returned to a national football title game played in Charleston, South Carolina, beating the Bulldogs of Louisiana Tech 19-6 for their third national football title. The MSU Bobcats football is the only college team with national titles in three different classifications. The team has won 19 conference titles and has made the NCAA FCS playoffs 9 times. Rodeo Montana State Bobcats rodeo team has a long proud history with the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. For almost 30 years MSU hosted the College National Finals Rodeo. Bobcat Rodeo teams have won 8 national team titles, 32 individual national championships and multiple Big Sky Regional crowns. The Bobcats Rodeo team operates under the MSU Department of Student Affairs and enjoys outstanding booster support form the C.A.T. Rodeo Scholarship Association. Skiing Montana State Bobcats Alpine and Nordic Ski team compete in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association and the NCAA Western Region and has produced 13 national champions. The Bobcat Nordic and alpine ski program venues at Bridger Bowl and Bohart Ranch have hosted six NCAA National Championships. The Big Sky Conference dropped its sponsorship of skiing and four other sports after the 1974 season.  Spirit Squad  The Montana State Spirit Squad is broken down into the Cheer team and Dance team. Former sports Baseball Montana State dropped its baseball program , following the 1971 season, and rival Montana played just one additional year. The Big Sky dropped baseball after the 1974 season, along with four other sports. Wrestling The Bobcat wrestling program won the first three Big Sky titles (1964, 1965, 1966); the conference discontinued the sport , after the 1987 season.

Missouri State competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and are members of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The school was known as Southwest Missouri State until 2005 when they changed the name to Missouri State. Missouri State's first football team was fielded in 1909 and the first coach in program history was Walter Langston who went 4-2 in his only season as head coach. Prior to 1923, the team competed as an Independent. From 1923 to 1980, Missouri State were members of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association, which Missouri State was a founding member of. During that time the Bears were classified in the NCAA College Division from 1958 to 1972. From 1973 to 1980 the Bears played in NCAA Division II. Missouri State moved up to the Association of Mid-Continent Universities in time for the 1981 season, which was their first season in Division I-AA. In 1985 the Bears became a founding member of the Gateway Football Conference which later became the Missouri Valley Football Conference in 2008. Missouri State has an all time record of 470-519-39 and have won 9 conference championships. They won their most recent conference championship in 1990. The 1990 season also, saw Missouri State ranked 2nd in the country for 3 weeks from 10/15/1990 to 10/29/1990. This is still the highest ranking school history. The team plays its home games at the 17,500 seat Robert W. Plaster Stadium which has been its home since 1941. Plaster Stadium is the 4th largest stadium in the conference and the second largest college football specific venue in Missouri. The Bears have had 21 head coaches in their history, including their current head coach Bobby Petrino. The 2020 season will be his first at Missouri State.

From its opening in 1941 to 1991 the stadium was known as Briggs Stadium. The stadium currently seats 17,500 people. It has undergone several major renovations in 1991 and, most recently, in 2014. After the 1991 renovation which added an upper-deck on the west side and a row of sky-boxes and press box, the stadium was renamed in honor of Robert W. Plaster who provided the major gift for the project. The Stadium was updated in 2008 with a new video board behind the South Endzone. The 2014 renovation made significant changes to the East side of the stadium and the playing surface. The track was removed and the East side was completely rebuilt.

The problem Most of Beethoven's best known works were published with opus numbers, with which they may be reliably identified. Another 205 works are designated WoO (Werke ohne Opuszahl ‚Äì literally, \\"works without opus number\\"), among them unpublished early and occasional works (Cantata on the Death of Emperor Joseph II, WoO 87), published variations and folksong arrangements (25 Irish Songs, WoO 152), posthumous publications ( \\"F√ºr Elise\\" WoO 59), and a number of unfinished works. The WoO list was extended but still left unaccounted for many fragments and sketches as well as numerous cases of uncertain attribution. The catalogues described here are attempts to organize and identify with precision all of these works in ways that are useful to musicologists, musicians, and the listening public. Opus number A bust of Beethoven, based on his 1812 life mask The traditional 19th-century method of identifying a composer's works was for publishers to assign some sort of consecutive Opus number to the works as they were published. This method is not entirely satisfactory to anyone. Musicians and the listening public have no reliable way to distinguish different works with similar characteristics. Musicologists cannot reliably identify unpublished works, nor do they have a reliable indication from the opus number of the actual composition date(s). For example, the Octet, written from 1792 to 1793 is Opus 103, while Opus 102 and Opus 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively. Some opus numbers comprise multiple pieces; 172 works are divided among 138 opus numbers. All of Beethoven's compositions up to and including Opus 135 were published in Beethoven's lifetime; later numbers were published posthumously, and are generally denoted by \\"Op. posth.\\" Kinsky catalogue In 1955, Georg Kinsky and Hans Halm published a catalogue of Beethoven's works, in which they assigned numbers to 205 \\"Werke ohne Opuszahl\\" (meaning \\"works without opus number\\" in German) to some of Beethoven's unpublished works. These numbers given these works are generally preceded by \\"WoO\\". The Kinsky‚ÄìHalm catalogue also lists 18 works in an appendix as being either doubtfully attributed, or simply spurious. Some of those listed as doubtful have since been shown to be authored by Beethoven. These numbers are generally preceded by \\"Anh.\\", short for German Anhang, meaning appendix. Hess catalogue The Swiss composer and musicologist Willy Hess also researched and published a catalogue in the 1950s, in which he included pieces not included in the 19th century complete edition published by Breitkopf and H√§rtel. Hess included many more fragmentary works than did Kinsky, and his catalog runs to 335 entries in the \\"Hauptkatalog\\" (main catalogue), and 66 \\"doubtful and falsely-attributed\\" works in an appendix. Many pieces have both WoO and H numbers. Biamonti catalogue Beethoven's compositions are also organized through the Biamonti Catalogue, compiled by Giovanni Biamonti and published in 1968. This work is an attempt to chronologically order all of Beethoven's creative output, in a manner similar to the catalogue of Franz Schubert's works by Otto Erich Deutsch. It combines the pieces with opus numbers, all of the works from the Kinsky and Hess catalogues, and previously uncatalogued fragments, into a single list comprising 849 entries.

It is the fourth of six Mr. Moto novels and can also be found in the omnibus Mr. Moto's Three Aces published in 1939., Website for the Mr. Moto novels by John P. Marquand The Moto novels are spy fiction and adventure novels set in the Orient, which in the 1930s was considered mysterious and exotic. Mr. Moto is a spy for the Imperial Japanese government and often deals with people who are accidentally involved in his work. Marquand traveled to China to gather information and atmosphere for his Moto novels as Millicent Bell, Marquand‚Äôs biographer states, ‚ÄúIn Mr. Moto Is So Sorry, Marquand went back once more to his memories of 1934, and his hero‚Äôs journey duplicates Marquand‚Äôs own arrival in China, although there is considerably more melodramatic incident along the fictional journey.‚Äù Plot Calvin Gates, an American, is traveling through Japan to mainland Asia. He boards a train which will eventually take him to Mongolia to join a scientific expedition. On the train is Sylvia Dillaway, a sketch artist, also on her way to the Gilbreth Expedition. Accompanying her is Boris, her Russian guide. When Mr. Moto appears, Boris becomes agitated and gives Dillaway a cigarette case made of silver inlaid with gunmetal, bearing a scenic design. Later at a stopover Boris is killed in Gates‚Äô hotel room. Mr. Moto comes in to clean things up and tells Gates that he knows of his past and why he is traveling to Mongolia. Gates is on the run from the police because his uncle believes that he stole money from his business. Moto asks about the cigarette case and realizes that Dillaway must have it. Moto wants the cigarette case to get to where it is headed, so he leaves the case with Dillaway. Knowing that the cigarette case is dangerous, Gates plots with Dillaway to make it seem like the case was stolen from her hotel room. Moto, however, suspects Gates and has him searched at a train stop. Gates and Dillaway continue on their journey with the cigarette case. At the next stop Captain Hamby comes on board. He was sent by Gilbreth to escort Dillaway to Ghuru Nor where the expedition is. However, his actual mission is to get the cigarette case to his Russian allies. The case includes a coded message meant for the Russian Army. He thinks the Japanese want to stop the message but doesn‚Äôt understand why Mr. Moto would want the message to get through. After a misunderstanding, Gates no longer wants anything to do with this business and gives the cigarette case to Dillaway. He leaves the train in Peking and is immediately picked up by Major Ahara of the Japanese Army, who wants to stop the cigarette case from getting to the Russians. Gates is rescued by Moto who explains how the Russian Army is poised to take Inner Mongolia but is waiting for the message which will tell when the Japanese Army will move toward Ghuru Nor. However, he does not explain why he wants the message to get through. Gates goes along with Moto and they fly to Kalgan to meet Dillaway and Hamby. Gates finds Dillaway and Dr. Gilbreth captive by Hamby in the compound of a caravan trader named Holtz. Hamby is negotiating the sale of the cigarette case between the Russians and the Japanese for Prince Wu, ruler of Ghuru Nor. Moto is brought in and reveals that he wanted the Russians to know the Japanese Army‚Äôs plans to judge the strength and conviction of the Russians. Major Ahara is convinced that Moto is a traitor and is killed by Hamby when he tries to escape. The Russian spy Shirov, who was present to negotiate for the case, agrees with Moto that one should die depending on how the Russian Army takes the news of the Japanese Army‚Äôs plans. Gates negotiates for his life and the lives of the expedition while they await the Russian Army‚Äôs reply. Shirov kills himself when told they will do nothing against the Japanese Army. At Moto‚Äôs suggestion, Prince Wu has Hamby killed because he killed Ahara. Moto and Japan win the rights to the Mongolian trade routes, thereby moving deeper into China. Characters *Calvin Gates ‚Äì An American from New York City *Sylvia Dillaway - An American artist from the Mid-West *Mr. I. A. Moto - Imperial spy for the Japanese government *Boris - Russian guide and spy *Captain Sam Hamby - Former Australian Army officer, currently working for Prince Wu *Major Ahara - Japanese Army officer *General Shirov - Russian spy and the brother to Boris *Prince Wu - Ruler of Ghuru Nor *Holtz - German trader in charge of the camel trade routes Themes The West (and America in particular) is portrayed as an outsider who know nothing of what is going on in the East. Gates and Dillaway, the two Americans are oblivious to the machinations of the Japanese and the Russian armies as they wrestle for control of China. Millicent Bell, Marquand‚Äôs biographer said that Gates is, > ‚Ä¶a man under a cloud, whose mission to China is purely personal, and who is > so indifferent to politics that he allows himself to be thought a Japanese > spy. Moto feels a kinship towards Americans, often referring to his time spent there. Though Moto does not always understand their actions or motivations he is able to manipulate Gates into fitting his plans. Major Ahara, Moto‚Äôs political opposite, does not like America and looks forward to the day they go to war. These multiple factions within the Japanese government are often referred to in Marquand‚Äôs Moto novels and figure in making Mr. Moto‚Äôs job difficult by giving him many fronts to fight against. This duality may have given the pre-WWII reading audience a chance to see the Japanese as multi- dimensional people at a time when Japan was still mysterious.

Church by the Bridge meets in St John the Baptist Church. The purpose of Church by the Bridge is to both reunite people who have put their trust in God but haven't been attending church, and provide an opportunity for people who live in the area to listen to the Good News (Gospel).\\"Statement of faith\\", Church by the Bridge our belief. The congregation consists of around 400 people from a wide variety of backgrounds, married, single and young families. The church was listed on the North Sydney Council local government heritage register on 2 August 2013.  History  The Church of St John the Baptist was founded in 1884 within the Parish of Christ Church, Lavender Bay. It subsequently became a parish in 1902. The population of Milsons Point declined following commercial development of the area in the 1970s. In 1983 a Chinese/Cantonese speaking congregation based in the Cathedral decided to join the congregation of St John's. The finances improved and arrears of assessments were paid. The church was amalgamated with the Parish of Neutral Bay (St Augustine's) on 1 December 1989, and together they went by the name St John the Baptist Kirribilli. The size of the Chinese congregation grew sufficiently to regain the church's status as an independent provisional parish. In 1993 the congregation comprises approximately 10% local European residents and 90% Chinese from many parts of the Diocese. In 2007 the Chinese (Cantonese) congregation moved to Artarmon, New South Wales. Bishop Glenn Davies invited Paul Dale to consider becoming curate in charge of St John's. In March 2011 a new evening congregation was planted at Christ Church, Lavender Bay and in 2016 this congregation moved to St Peter's Presbyterian Church Hall at McMahons Point. A church plant of St Thomas' Anglican Church, North Sydney in February 2005, the church offers six Bible-based services each Sunday 8am, 9:45am, 3.30pm, 5:30pm, 6.15pm and 7pm. In 2020 a formal relationship between Church by the Bridge, Kirribilli and St Augustine's Anglican Church, Neutral Bay was formed to become one parish. Buildings St John the Baptist, Kirribilli was designed by Edmund Blacket as a church school, in the Romanesque Revival style, and built in 1884. A vestry and sanctuary were added in 1900. The nearby kindergarten was built as a church hall in 1909.  Ministry and services  The church runs \\"Carols Under The Bridge\\", located in Bradfield Park under the northern end of Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The plot follows King Edward VII and President Armand Falli√®res dreaming of building a tunnel under the English Channel. Production The idea of building a tunnel under the Channel was much discussed in 1907; M√©li√®s's film is a highly topical take on the popular subject. M√©li√®s appears in the film as the engineer who presents the blueprints for the tunnel. Fernande Albany, an actress who also appeared in M√©li√®s's The Impossible Voyage, An Adventurous Automobile Trip, and The Conquest of the Pole, plays the leader of the Salvation Army parade. King Edward was played by a wash-house attendant who closely resembled the monarch, reprising a role he had played five years before in M√©li√®s's film The Coronation of Edward VII. Special effects used in the film include stage machinery, pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions, and dissolves. Release and reception Tunneling the English Channel was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 936‚Äì950 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a fantaisie burlesque √† grand spectacle en 30 tableaux. For many of his longer films, Georges M√©li√®s prepared a boniment, a spoken commentary explaining the action, to be read aloud while the film was shown; according to the recollections of M√©li√®s's son Andr√© M√©li√®s, the boniment for Tunneling the English Channel included dialogues between the French president and English king, with the latter speaking French in a thick English accent. The composer B√©tove (real name Michel Maurice L√©vy, 1883‚Äì1965) recorded a piano score for the film in 1946. American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum named it as one of his 100 favorite films.

In addition to running a primary care facility, Wellbody operates a women's center and will open a birth center in 2015. They also focus on the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis and provide medical services to amputee victims from the 11-year Sierra Leone Civil War. Their response effort during the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa has received widespread media attention. These efforts include supporting four treatment facilities in rural Kono, house-to-house contract tracing and surveillance, the large-scale distribution of protective gear throughout Sierra Leone and an emphasis on sensitive community engagement to help stop the spread of the virus.Fink, Sherri. \\"With Aid Doctors Gone, Ebola Fight Grows Harder\\". New York Times. 08/17/2014Goldberg, Eleanor. \\"Aid Worker Speaks Out On Why Ebola Keeps Spreading\\". Huffington Post. 08/08/2014. History Wellbody Alliance was founded in 2006 by Bailor Barrie, a recent graduate of The University of Sierra Leone's medical school in Freetown, and Dan Kelly, a medical student from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The two formed Wellbody, then called Global Action Foundation, and served communities out of a mobile clinic. At the time, their focus was providing amputee victims with high quality, accessible healthcare.Miller, Rathe. \\"Healing the horror\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer. 11/02/2008. In 2008, the two founded a clinic in Kono District, where four doctors serve a population of 400,000, 1 in 23 women dies during childbirth and 1 in 5 children dies before age 5. Services Wellbody has since expanded its services, operating a primary care facility and a women's center. They were scheduled to open a birth center at the same site in 2015. Through clinical and community-based programs, the organization provides an estimated 30,000 people with healthcare, with over 70% receiving these services free of charge. Approach Wellbody places an emphasis on community-based healthcare. In addition to consulting and treating patients at their clinic, their community health workers provide medical services in remote villages, making home visits throughout Kono District. They provide home-based care for those with chronic conditions and accompany other patients to the appropriate healthcare facilities. Partners Wellbody currently partners with Sierra Leone's National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control Programme, National AIDS Secretariat, EcoMed laboratory, Koidu Government Hospital, Kono District's Health Management Team and Kono's Amputees and War Wounded Association. International partners include the World Health Organization, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Partners In Health. Response to the 2014‚Äì2015 Ebola virus epidemic  Wellbody's role as a primary healthcare provider in Kono District placed them in a position of leadership during the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. In addition to being the only primary care clinic that has remained open throughout the entire outbreak in Eastern Sierra Leone, they were supporting four treatment facilities in remote parts of Kono, conducting house-to-house contact tracing and surveillance and, staying rooted in their community-based approach, advocating for sensitive and communicative community engagement in order to stop the spread of the virus.

Many of the surnames are taken from various winners of the All Japan Kendo Championships. Muroe High School Toraji Ishida ; : :Also known as \\"Kojir≈ç\\", he is the kendo instructor, and also a teacher of politics and economics, at Muroe High School. He is the main protagonist of the series as well as the male lead. He is perpetually impoverished and lives from paycheck to paycheck, often taking handouts of food from his students. He is offered the chance of a lifetime from an old senpai ‚Äï a year's supply of sushi if his female kendo team can beat his senpai's in a practice tournament. This inspires Kojir≈ç to put an effort into training his team, much to the delight of his most dedicated student, Kirino Chiba. The only person who knows the real reason for Kojir≈ç's inspiration is Y≈´ji Nakata, who calls him \\"pathetic\\". Kojir≈ç's parents own a convenience store, but it is revealed that they used to own a store that sold sake. Kojir≈ç's parents look young for their age, and his mother acts young (she makes a hobby of collecting cute things). Despite Kojir≈ç's poverty, he somehow owns and maintains a high-performance car. In high school, he was a member of the kendo club. At that time he defeated his senpai, Kenzabur≈ç, at a tournament to win a trophy. Though he has little affinity for the trophy itself, he cherishes the memory of his victory over Kenzabur≈ç. Although he told Kenzabur≈ç his victory was due to luck, he personally believes the reason he won was he was stronger than his senpai. Tamaki Kawazoe ; : :Tamaki Kawazoe is a first year high school student she is the female lead of the story. She is nicknamed \\"Tama-chan\\" for short. Despite being a kendo prodigy, she does not see it as a hobby, but rather just as a chore honed at her home, which happens to be a kendo dojo led by her father. She refuses to join the school's Kendo Club because she thinks it is unnecessary, but she temporarily becomes a member in order to fight off a bully. She despises injustice due to her overdeveloped sense of righteousness and fair play inspired from watching tokusatsu as a child; her favorite is Blade Braver. She remains a big anime and tokusatsu fan despite her age. At first, she is very shy and unsociable, but she begins to overcome her shyness and open up to her teammates more often after holding a part-time job at Miyako's acquaintance's store. Kirino, Sayako (and for that matter, most girls in the story) find her very cute, often putting Tamaki's hair up in ponytails or making her fight in kendo matches just because they want to see her fight. She knows Y≈´ji before the beginning of the series, and she has been called \\"Tama-chan\\" by him since their childhood although she does not like the nickname very much since it makes her seem childish). She is described as being the strength of the group by Kojir≈ç. Tamaki lost for the very first time in the Kanto High School Kendo Tournament to Rin, Tamaki's arch-rival stemming from the Blade Braver series. Her loss was partly because Rin used a stance which reminded her of her late mother causing her to lose focus and concentration temporarily. In elementary school, she reached the top three in the national kendo match. :She plays the position of General (Taishou) in the competition. Kirino Chiba ; : :Kirino Chiba is a second year high school student and the captain of the kendo club. Energetic and enthusiastic, she dreams of leading the team to the nationals. Her family owns a deli named \\"Chiba Deli\\". Kirino is very happy that Kojir≈ç has finally begun to put more effort into training his kendo team, but she is oblivious to the real reason that her teacher has suddenly begun to train the team enthusiastically. She is proud that she is the captain of the kendo club and is more responsible than she appears. For example, she picks up the shinai when the other members leave them lying around on the floor and chides the other members for not picking up after themselves. Kirino seems to find Tamaki quite adorable; she and Sayako will often treat Tamaki as a \\"little sister\\" type. Examples of this are playing with Tamaki's hair, not listening to her kendo lectures, and making Tamaki fight merely because she wants to see her fight. Despite that, she has great confidence in Tamaki. She is described as being the heart of the group by Kojir≈ç. She also shows a strong emotional attachment to Kojir≈ç as displayed in the last anime episode when he comes back as the club's instructor. :She plays the position of Second-in-Command (Fukushou) in the competition. has a fetish about sweat Miyako Miyazaki ; : :Miyako Miyazaki is a first year high school student nicknamed \\"Miya-Miya\\". She is introduced as a very pretty and friendly girl, and to the surprise of many, the girlfriend of Danj≈´r≈ç. However, in reality, she possesses a very dark and sadistic personality, but she hides it in order to be together with Danj≈´r≈ç. In the manga, she also smokes in school and hangs out with two girls that are possibly delinquents, but she is not seen doing so in the anime. When Miyako shows her more sadistic side, she is surrounded by a black aura and acts in a rather eerie and cruel manner, but she instantly switches back to her friendly fa√ßade when others are approaching or calling her name. Having only joined the Kendo Club because Danj≈´r≈ç was in it, she initially finds it boring, but she later enjoys it after realizing she likes to hit people. She has rather quick and powerful strikes, but she at first does not use any other moves other than attempting to strike her opponents in the head in the anime. In one episode of the anime, however, Miyako was shown to strike at the other areas on her opponent although none of the strikes counted due to incorrect posture. She is very afraid of her middle school classmate, Reimi Odajima. This is due to a love relationship incident that resulted in Reimi stalking her ever since. As the series goes on, her kendo skills begins to improve tremendously, and she finally managed to score a kote point against Azuma in the 22nd episode. :She plays the position of Second-Vanguard (Jih√¥) in the competition. Sayako Kuwahara ; : :Sayako Kuwahara is a second year high school student described as being random and spontaneous, often changing her interests and goals. During her first year, she joins the Kendo Club, but she would sometimes disappear for short periods of time, claiming to quit. She and Kirino have known each other since elementary school, and Kirino often calls her \\"Saya\\". She is one of the tallest members on the team; others poke fun at this by \\"mistakenly\\" calling her a boy. In the storyline, she was seen to improve her footwork tremendously after a brief teaching session from Tamaki. Sayako, like Kirino, thinks that Tamaki is cute; she and Kirino will sometimes do silly things to Tamaki, such as playing with Tamaki's hair, not listening to her kendo lectures, and making Tamaki fight merely because she wants to see her fight. She is rather pessimistic and always claims to pursue death the moment she fails at something. In the anime, her writer's hobby is seen when telling stories, such as explaining why Asuma quit kendo in a dramatic fashion; her friends gave her three points since they found her \\"story\\" uninteresting. In the manga, she is seriously against high schooler smokers, confiscating Miya-Miya's cigarettes (before they were introduced each other in the kendo club the next day), leading to a bad start between them, that was resolved when Miya apologized to Saya, promising not to smoke again inside the school and leaving the pack of cigarettes she was carrying at the time to Saya, telling her to \\"hold them for her\\". Saya later forgot to throw them away and his little brother will caught her with the pack on her hands, making her family think she was a smoker and ending in a funny scene (her mother reacted by punching her in the face and his father skipped work for the first time to scold her). :In another occasion, she argued with some girls from the Kamazaki highschool kendo club, who were smoking, before the practice match. The girls reacted very angry, but before something happened Miya-Miya intervened and told Saya to leave them alone, mocking the girls by telling them that smoking was kids' stuff and that she dropped it after Middle school, making them even angrier. They later, fought against these girls on the practice match. :She plays the position of Center (Ch√ªken) in the competition. Satori Azuma ; : :Satori Azuma, a first-year high school student in the anime, is the fifth and the last person to join the Kendo Club. She is very talented in kendo. In fact, Satori is the second strongest in the club, with Tamaki being the strongest. Despite her diligence, she is very bad with her studies. It is revealed her glasses are fake; she thought she would get smarter by wearing them. She decided to quit kendo after middle school in order to concentrate on her studies. Because she is rather na√Øve, she is tricked by Miyako Miyazaki into joining the club, thinking that Kendo will help her improve her studies. Satori is comically clumsy, as demonstrated in the ending sequences and previews in the anime. :She plays the position of Vanguard (Senpou) in the competition. Yuji Nakata ; : :Y≈´ji Nakata is a kind, cheerful, and helpful first year student who joins the Kendo Club. He was a member of his junior high school's kendo club and had also attended the Kawazoe Dojo. He had reached the top five in the prefectural games during junior high. In the Q&A; of the manga, Tamaki asserts that he is stronger than Toyama. He is almost on par with Tamaki in skill, and he has defeated Satori Azuma once. Y≈´ji has used kendo to scare away some gangsters although he panicked after the gangsters had run off. He is also the only person who knows of Kojir≈ç's true reason for training his kendo team with more gusto than before. He also possesses considerable academic skill; he scored fourth out of all the freshmen on the regional exams. Danjuro Eiga ; : :Also known as Dan-kun, Danj≈´r≈ç Eiga is a round and plain-faced (and somewhat goofy-looking) first year who joins the Kendo Club with Y≈´ji. He originally wanted to join the Ping Pong Club, but there was no such club in the school. He shocks Y≈´ji and Kojir≈ç when he brings his pretty girlfriend Miyako, whom they assumed had the same cartoony look, to join the club. While he finds the basic training to be \\"boring\\" (possibly because he wants to impress Miyako), he is rather proficient in scorekeeping, as shown in one episode of the anime. While he generally comes off as rather dim-witted, it appears he is perceptive to the character Miyako does not want him to see. In Episode 11, he was hinted to also have his own \\"dark side\\" during a staring contest he had with Kojir≈ç. However, his \\"black mode\\" was subtler than Miyako's \\"black mode,\\" and his aura only showed in his eyes. He has no past experience with Kendo, but he is improving very quickly, even to the point where Y≈´ji thinks Danjuro might surpass him before they graduate. Y≈´ji has even remarked in an episode of the anime that Danj≈´r≈ç \\"are meant for kendo\\". Eiga is arguably the smartest member of the Kendo club because he scored 2nd place is the Muroe High School Regional exams for freshman. By the end of the anime series, it is revealed that he is the new captain of the Kendo Club. Toyama ; : :Toyama is the school bully and formerly a member of the Kendo Club. He often ditches kendo practice and had caused all the previous club members to quit with the exception of Kirino and Sayako. He did so by \\"teaching\\" them techniques; he was just constantly hitting them with his shinai. Once, Miyako attempts to teach him and Iwasa a lesson, but she fails to do so when Sayako crashes into her. It appears that neither Toyama nor Iwasa come to kendo anymore. In episodes 22 and 23, it is also shown that he and Iwasa are delinquents; they fought two other students when provoked in a video game arcade and destroyed two machines ‚Äï an act that almost led to the kendo club's suspension. Although he and Iwasa terrorized the kendo club during their brief time in the club, Toyama actually feels that he is not as strong as he appears as shown in episode 24 of the anime. Eventually both he and Iwasa decide to resign from the club to save it from suspension even though they both do not hate kendo. After easily losing to her, it is implied that he is afraid of Tamaki due to her strength. In the closing credits of the anime's final episodes, it is shown that he has joined the soccer team with Iwasa, and he is verbally fighting with an opposing player. Iwasa ; : :Iwasa is Toyama's friend and fellow Kendo Club member, who also ditches practice. Nothing much is known about this character, and he has not been seen with a shinai before in the anime. In the anime, it appears that both he and Toyama have dropped kendo, as they no longer come by. Both he and Toyama are delinquents and have resigned kendo despite their fondness of it. In the closing credits of the final episode of the anime, he is shown to be on the soccer team with Toyama. Shinobu Toyama ; : :Shinobu wants to join clubs, such as the ping-pong club, lacrosse club, and sepak takraw club, but none of the clubs she likes exist. So in the end, she joins her friend, Makoto, in joining the kendo club. She is impatient and ill-mannered, but her attitude is better than her brother's. Her brother's gear was given to her by her mother. Makoto Iwasa ; : :Makoto is one of the new freshman members of the kendo club and turns out to be Iwasa's little brother. He is patient, polite, and cool-headed, unlike his brother. Makoto is a complete beginner when it comes to kendo. He was impressed when he observed Tamaki doing kendo, which makes him more motivated to join the kendo club. Makoto's kendo gear was given to him by his brother. Yoshikawa ; : :Satori's homeroom teacher, Yoshikawa becomes involved in Muroe's kendo club out of concern for Satori's well-being. When Satori shows that she is capable of balancing kendo with school work, Yoshikawa continues to support the kendo club. She and Kojir≈ç become friends and frequently chat when they are both in the staff room. She is skilled at playing video games. When Kojir≈ç leaves the kendo club, Yoshikawa is requested by the club to become their advisor; she agrees to do so until she goes on maternity leave. The father of her baby is Kenzabur≈ç, Kojir≈ç's upperclassman. Other characters ; ; : :The vice principal of Muroe Highschool. He is seen in episode one when he falls out the school's third floor window. Tamaki saved his life by quickly grabbing a broom nearby and hitting him back up through the window he fell out of. He lends Tamaki his glasses, which she uses under the guise of Bureiba. ; ; : ; ; : Machido High School ; : :Kenzabur≈ç Ishibashi is Kojir≈ç's old senpai and the kendo coach from Machido High School. He was beaten by Kojir≈ç during a kendo meet long ago in their high school years and seems to hold a grudge against him for that, even if it does not seem apparent. Kenzabur≈ç is also jealous of Kojir≈ç's team, particularly because he has Tamaki Kawazoe, a freshman of Muroe High who beat two of his kendo team members in a practice duel one time. Kenzabur≈ç is a more dedicated teacher than Kojir≈ç, but like his kohai he trains his kendo team only for his own personal gain. He is assumed to be married to Yoshikawa- sensei, one of the teachers at Muroe High School and Kojir≈ç's co-worker who was also a temporary adviser to Muroe High's kendo club. ; : :Konatsu Harada, the first third-year student on the team, is the shortest of the five members of the team Kenzaburo chose, and also the shyest. She is rather skilled in kendo as Kenzaburo once remarks that she has a 2-dan rank, is \\"self- motivated\\", and comes to practice every day. She is very quiet and can be flustered by some of the things her team, particularly her teacher, does (as shown in one episode of the anime). Konatsu is one of the strongest members on the team, second only to Karen Nishiyama. During a practice match with Muroe High Konatsu, she was beaten by Tamaki Kawazoe. ; : :Maya Yokoo, the second third-year student on the team, is a competitive and tall girl with more team spirit than anyone else in her team. Maya is a bit of a tomboy and tends to speak in a rather aggressive and foul-mouthed manner, calling her teammates \\"twits\\" and \\"dumbasses\\" when they do not take kendo seriously. However, she will stick up for her teammates when Y≈´ri says cruel things about them (or rather, Akemi), as shown in two episodes of the anime. Apparently she also seems to have a rather large appetite that causes her to eat so much that she ends up with a severe stomachache later on. Tamaki beat Maya during the last round of the practice match with Muroe High, much to the latter's displeasure and shock. ; : :Y≈´ri And≈ç, the first second-year student on the team, is a girl who seems to zone out most of the time and seems not to care much about winning, but her looks can deceive others greatly. She is rather skilled at kendo and is quite sadistic, like Miyako Miyazaki of Muroe High. Another trait of hers that resembles Miyako's is Y≈´ri's tendency to turn \\"black\\" and let some of her true nature show through, which always manages to induce fear in everyone, including her own teammates. (Unlike Miyako, however, Y≈´ri also tends to openly badmouth her teammates, particularly Akemi Asakawa, when they do something that displeases her.) When Y≈´ri is showing her crueler side she is surrounded by a rather eerie black aura that looks rather similar to, if not exactly like, Miyako's \\"black\\" aura. Y≈´ri also tends to resort to using nasty methods to win (such as tripping people with her foot, stepping on her opponents' feet, and \\"harassing\\" her opponent by showing her \\"black\\" aura) and then deny that she has cheated in a falsely sweet manner, much to the chagrin of the other members of her kendo team, who are already rather frustrated with her apparent lack of team spirit. Apparently Y≈´ri has a bit of a sweet tooth, as she once cost her team precious time at a practice match with Muroe High by making them stop at a caf√© so she could \\"charge\\" her brain with sugar. She apparently does not function well in the morning. Another one of Y≈´ri's disturbing traits, seen in episode 15, is her ability to sleep with her eyes open. This freaks Tamaki out when she wakes up next to her while at Training Camp. Occasionally she is seen reading a book during important moments (such as kendo matches or team member assignments), a habit that only emphasizes her complete lack of desire to win. She was the replacement of Tamaki in the part- time job at the shop, increasing the sales but turning the place into some sort of black magic shop (as seen on Special chapter 58.5 in the manga). ; : :Karen Nishiyama, the third third-year student on the team, is incredibly skilled at kendo, but tends to shake when nervous. When she is cornered in a kendo match she instinctively switches to the offensive, thus effectively beating her opponent. Because of her instinct of going on offense when in trouble Karen is the strongest on her kendo team. Even though she is extremely skilled at kendo, she does not like the idea of fighting an opponent that she does not know in real life, and she will attempt to run away when she is nervous. ; : :Akemi Asakawa, the second second-year student on the team, is probably the most undedicated out of all the members of her team, as she seems only to care about her boyfriend to the point where she will ditch kendo club for her boyfriend. When she encounters a problem with her boyfriend she will not do her best and will only go on the defense; however, when her boyfriend makes up with her she will immediately start pouring out all of her effort, making her a rather formidable opponent. Apparently none of her teammates save for Kenzabur≈ç have any real concern for her, as they simply let her constant ditchings slide (even if she is ditching from a kendo match). Kenzabur≈ç, however, is appalled with her habit of constantly ditching kendo just to meet up with her boyfriend and her lack of effort when she is upset. It is revealed in one episode of the anime that Akemi possesses \\"excellent footwork\\". Seimei High School ; : :Tadaaki Hayashi is the coach for the Seimei High School kendo team. He is extremely strict with his students, and verbally and physically punishes them when they lose a match--even if it is against a stronger opponent. His tough training regiments often cause students to quit the kendo team, although he does not regret this, and considers quitters to be weak. After the practice with Muroe High, however, he seems to have changed his outlook on kendo, and is easier on his students, emphasizing the fun and excitement of kendo rather than its harshness and tough work. ; : : Mei is a freshman on the Seimei High School kendo team. She joined the team to be with her friends, although all of them eventually quit until she was the very last freshman girl left on the team. This discourages her, and she desired to quit the kendo team after the practice with Muroe High, but is convinced otherwise when getting fired up after practicing with Tamaki. ; : :A girl who attended the same middle school as Miyako, and became obsessed with her when she beat up a boy who Reimi had a crush on, but who liked Miyako. Since finding out that Miyako joined the kendo club, she follows her to every tournament, taking countless pictures and recording videos of her. Miyako is very disturbed by her stalking, and has lost a few matches due to being distracted by her. ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : Tozyo High School ; : :Konishi is the general of the Tozyo High School team. She is the leader of the kendo team that has a reputation for winning matches through cheating. During the preliminary tournament, her schoolmates locked Tamaki in a shed after tricking her into coming to the parking lot to meet up with her father. There, Konishi got her out and led her to a trap where she injured her ankle after tripping over a bunch of tennis balls that were carefully placed. She was beaten by an enraged Tamaki in her match after receiving a throat strike, but the match was forfeited when Toraji pulled Tamaki out due to her injury. In the closing credits of the anime's final episode, it appears that she has gotten a haircut, and was scolding her classmates, presumably for attempting to cheat again. This suggests that she no longer resorts to cheating to win. :In the manga, after losing to Tamaki, it is revealed that when she was a child she had violent tendencies (like breaking stuff) because her parents were divorced. Her family encouraged her to start kendo around that age, and thanks to this she calmed herself a bit, but after she started to improve, others started to expect from her and she started to feel pressured. Due to this pressure, she resorted to everything (even cheating), to accomplish victory. She then concluded that it would be better to lose (like she did against Tamaki) and stop others' high expectations, but in the end she regained herself and claimed that she would get better, like Tamaki is. ; : ; ; : ; : Kamazaki High School ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Touryuu High School ; Sakaki is Tamaki's rival in the manga. Although they have barely met (and that Sakaki quit kendo), it is thought to have been \\"fate\\" and therefore everyone is hoping for a match between them and consider her Tamaki's only match. She is more or less a replacement for Rin Suzuki in the manga (although Rin has been mentioned), as she takes the role of the one to defeat Tamaki so that Tamaki becomes stronger. In the end, the one to defeat Tamaki first, was Sawamiya Erina, a 16-year-old TV idol (whose real name is Yamada Umeko, a former national-level kendoka, rival of Sakaki, that dropped kendo due to frustration over not being able to defeat Ura even once) in a special television event of kendo beauties (Muroe was invited because Odajima Reimi sent footage of Miya-Miya to the TV station). After that, Ura appeared and challenged Erina, leading to a long all-out fight, that left an impression on Tamaki (making her gain conviction and the will to become even stronger). Months later, a special tournament is held on TV. The first match of Muroe is against a team composed of Ura and other skilled kendo girls (including Erina), and after two wins and two losses, the decisive fight between Tamaki and Ura leads to the end of the history. In the anime, she is only seen at the ending credits of episode 26, first talking to Suzuki Rin and then when she and Tamaki cross each other at the tournament's entrance. Main characters' family ; : : Toraji's father is seen briefly in the anime when he forces his son to work at the family store during his visit. He is a tough man and a hard worker. ; : : Toraji's mother is not seen in the series, but she frequently sends packages of faddish health foods to her son. However, the food is usually insufficient nourishment for the poor Toraji, or of minimal use. She is shown briefly in the anime and forces her son to work at the store when he comes over to visit. ; : :Tamaki's unnamed father is the head of the Kawazoe dojo. He encouraged Tamaki to take up kendo at a very young age, and is therefore responsible for her amazing skill in kendo. Tamaki's father is possibly in his mid-50s as he keeps saying \\"I'm at an age where I can't even understand Tama-chan anymore\\" in one episode of the anime. That said, he is in practice a kind, loving, considerate and doting father who merely lacks articulate skills and confidence to express his affections for Tamaki. He constantly worries every time Tamaki brings up Y≈´ji, mistakenly believing that he and Tamaki are seeing each other, to the point he spies on them at training camp to make sure nothing is happening and constantly frowning or making an angry face whenever Y≈´ji's name is brought up. ; :Tamaki's mother, who died when Tamaki was very young. Tamaki has only a few memories of her mother, but greatly respects her and remembers that her mother was amazingly talented at kendo. She seemed to have been fond of the high stance, and Tamaki becomes distracted whenever an opponent uses it against her. ; : : Kirino's mother helps run the family's deli. She collapses from exhaustion in the middle of the series, which causes Kirino to become distressed and more withdrawn, although her seriousness improved her skills in kendo. In the middle of a match, however, her brother yelled out to her that their mother was all right, in which she immediately lost focus--and the match. ; ; ; ; : ; : ; : :Sayako's younger brother. Kawazoe dojo pupil ; : :Sakaguchi is the owner of the kendo equipment shop that Kojir≈ç takes his kendo team to for purchasing equipment. While Sakaguchi's kendo skills are only seen in a series of flashbacks in the anime, it is apparent that he is incredibly skilled at kendo, strong enough to make all of the members of Kojir≈ç's team complain about him. He has a fondness for mochi, although Kojir≈ç's kendo team tends to eat all of Sakaguchi's mochi during their visits to his shop. He is also, as Kojir≈ç puts it, \\"very competitive\\". ; Others ; : ; : ; ; : ; ; : :Considered to be the mascot character of Bamboo Blade, the Cat appears in every episode in the background or even seen interacting with the other characters. In Episode 25, two characters mention that the Gray cat that appears in the episode is a rare cat that only appears every 25 episodes. ; : ; : ; : :An anime-only character, Carrie is an American girl raised in Japan with a loud and pushy attitude. She becomes Miyako's rival for Dan's affections since Carrie finds that he resembles her pet armadillo, Anderson. After seeing a samurai movie as a child, she has always wanted to fight with two swords. As such, she is a strong opponent capable of using the two-sword style of kendo, despite high school competitions prohibiting the use of the two sword technique. Because Carrie has considerably more experience than the novice Miyako, Miyako trains especially hard to defeat Carrie. In the 25th episode, she finally defeats Carrie in a match, and later goes on to defeat her again with Carrie using the two-sword style (she defeats her after successfully knocking both swords from her hand with one swing). ; : :Rin is fond of the \\"Super Sentai Blade Braver\\" like Tamaki but she prefers Shinaider (which sort of an enemy) more than the Blade Bravers. Rin and Tamaki first meet during a live action performance, where Red Braver had a guest appearance, and participate in a fan-quiz for the prize of limited edition Blade Braver dolls, which Rin wins (she only keeps the Shinaider doll and gives Tamaki the rest). Later, they work together in the new Blade Braver movie and the girls become friends and rivals because of their mutual interest the Braver series and their strength in kendo. She is the strongest opponent that Tamaki has ever seen and the first, and only person in the anime, to defeat Tamaki, using the high stance to do so. However, she is defeated by Tamaki at the same tournament where Kojir≈ç defeated Kenzabur≈ç nine years ago. During the final episode, it is shown that the two are still friends and see the Blade Braver movie together, both gaining respect for the other's favorite by the movie's end. ; : Bamboo Blade characters ","title":"List of Bamboo Blade characters"},{"id":"20319566","text":"Miroslav (Friedrich) Navratil (19 July 1893 ‚Äì 7 June 1947) was a Croatian soldier, pilot, and general who served in the armies of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and the Independent State of Croatia. Until the end of World War I Navratil was born in Sarajevo in the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He attended gymnasium in Sarajevo, and finished cadet's school in Graz. In World War I he served in the military of Austria‚ÄìHungary, as a fighter pilot in the Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. While on the Eastern and Italian fronts, he scored a victory with Flik 41J on 14 April 1918, before assuming command of Flik 3J on 9 June 1918. Flying Albatros D.IIIs, he scored nine more victories. The Albatros DIII flown by Navratil in August 1918. He attained the rank of Oberleutnant.Friedrich Navratil, The Aerodrome His victory string ran until 31 August, when he downed a Bristol F.2 Fighter, but lost all four of his inexperienced wingmen in the process. Navratil blamed himself for their loss. He largely removed himself from combat operations. On 21 October, during a test flight of an Albatros D.III, his seat broke, and he was injured in the resultant crash landing. He did not recover before the Armistice. Between the World Wars In 1918, Austria-Hungary dissolved and Navratil moved to the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where he took on a position in the royal army. He rose to the rank of colonel, but was eventually retired from the army in 1940 because of conflict with Serb officers within its ranks. World War II With the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April 1941 Navratil was brought back into active service. He was named as a military representative in Bucharest. He served as minister of the armed forces from 2 September 1943 to 29 January 1944. After he was relieved of his post, reportedly due to complaints about the brutality of the government, he traveled to Vienna, where his family was located and remained there until the end of World War II. In 1945 he moved to Zell am See, where he lived until he was located by American troops in 1946. He was extradited to communist Yugoslavia in December 1946. In Zagreb he was sentenced to death on charge of war crimes, and executed on 7 June 1947.

The first storm hit on 16 November 2008 and was followed by two further storms on 19 and 20 November. The storms resulted in 2 fatalities. Background First incident Winds reached /h, equivalent to a Category 3 cyclone. Electricity was cut to about 230,000 homes and about 4,000 homes were left in need of serious repair, and at least 30 houses were beyond repair. Some of the worst hit areas included The Gap, Kenmore, Arana Hills and Albany Creek. Forecasters at the Bureau of Meteorology rated the storm the worst to hit south-east Queensland since 2004 & The Biggest to The South east Queensland region since 1985. Second incident Torrential rain affected areas of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba, with rainfall reaching more than 250 mm in some locations. The Ipswich and Marburg areas were the worst affected, whilst four homes in inner-city Paddington were unroofed. The Inner City Bypass was flooded and forced to close, as was the Moggill Ferry. Third incident Blackwater, near Emerald in Central Queensland, was hit hard by the third storm, with 20 houses sustaining roof damage and up to 100 more were damaged in some way. Gregory MP Vaughan Johnson said the storm was terrifying. He said he was driving to an appointment when the storm slammed into Blackwater, forcing him to turn back to Emerald. Hail was described as the size of golf balls and witnesses saw a lot of damage. Relief effort Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd inspected The Gap, a badly hit suburb in north-western Brisbane, with Premier of Queensland Anna Bligh and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane Campbell Newman on 18 November, likening it to a \\"war zone\\". He announced that Centrelink would make payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per dependent child in cases where they were seriously injured or their houses were destroyed. Bligh launched a Disaster Relief Appeal with $500,000 to supplement other government support packages.

Overview The album was produced by Magnatone Records, and features a wide array of superstar talent collaborating with Rogers on various songs on the album. The album did hit the charts, with its strongest showing on the country charts at number 26, but it did not produce any singles. Artists included in collaborations on the album include All-4-One, The Katinas, Tareva Henderson and Bekka & Billy. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying that \\" Even with all these collaborators, the album sounds homogenous, especially since the material is entirely generic. However, it holds together better than most Rogers albums since the mid-'80s, because it is evident that some thought and care went into its production.\\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/across-my-heart-mw0000025122 Track listing Personnel * Kenny Rogers ‚Äì acoustic guitar, lead vocals * Jerry Kimbrough ‚Äì acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Brent Rowan ‚Äì acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Biff Watson ‚Äì acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Steve Glassmeyer ‚Äì keyboards, Hammond organ, backing vocals * Warren Hartman ‚Äì keyboards * Randy McCormick ‚Äì keyboards, Hammond organ, acoustic piano * Bobby Ogdin ‚Äì keyboards, Hammond organ, acoustic piano, electric piano * Gene Sisk ‚Äì keyboards, backing vocals * Duncan Mullins ‚Äì bass guitar * Willie Weeks ‚Äì bass guitar * Eddie Bayers ‚Äì drums * Paul Leim ‚Äì drums, congas, percussion, tambourine * Tom Roady ‚Äì percussion * Jim Horn ‚Äì soprano saxophone * Kim Carnes ‚Äì backing vocals * Robert Bailey Jr. ‚Äì backing vocals * Kim Fleming ‚Äì backing vocals * Vicki Hampton ‚Äì backing vocals * Cindy Walker ‚Äì backing vocals * Bergen White ‚Äì backing vocals Chart performance {  !

The song was written by Sandler, Ian Maxtone-Graham and Robert Smigel. History It was first performed during the Weekend Update segment of the season 18 episode of Saturday Night Live on November 21, 1992 as a duet between Sandler and Weekend Update anchor Kevin Nealon; it was originally intended to be a recurring Thanksgiving tradition with other cast members debuting their own original songs, but the next year, it was again Sandler, doing another version of the same song in the style of Bruce Springsteen. A live performance of the original song was recorded at The Strand in Redondo Beach, California on July 25, 1993. The version at The Strand was featured on Sandler's debut album They're All Gonna Laugh at You! and was released as a single. Song details The song, which Sandler sings in a childlike, semi-falsetto voice, primarily revolves around the repetition of the word \\"turkey\\" in various two-line rhymes, many of which are non sequiturs; for instance, \\"Turkey with gravy and cranberries/Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry!\\" Celebrity and pop culture references include: *Betty Grable *50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong *Turkey-related drowsiness *Jimmie Walker's portrayal of J. J. Evans and his catch phrase \\"Dyn-o-mite!\\" *Darryl Strawberry's departure from the New York Mets (Sandler erroneously refers to Strawberry being traded; in fact, Strawberry left as a free agent and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers). *Mike Tyson raping Desiree Washington *Lake Winnipesaukee (SNL version only) *Cheryl Tiegs posters (1993 recordings onward; a reference to Sandler's Canteen Boy character, who had a crush on Tiegs) *Sammy Davis, Jr. having only one eye *Corduroy pants *Mopeds Legacy The song is a predecessor to Sandler's more popular holiday song, \\"The Chanukah Song\\" (also co-written by Maxtone-Graham and Sandler). When \\"The Chanukah Song\\" became a hit on the rock charts (and a minor hit on the Hot 100) in 1996, \\"The Thanksgiving Song\\" was released as a follow-up the next year; it too became a hit, charting at #40 on the Adult Top 40 chart and #29 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1997. The song continues to receive extensive radio airplay around Thanksgiving, on various formats, both with other holiday-themed songs and without.https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/why-adam-sandlers- thanksgiving-song-is-a-holiday-classic-20141124 Various radio cuts remove or edit one verse which states \\"my brother likes to masturbate with baby oil\\" but it is otherwise identical to the live performance at The Strand. The edits also leave in a portion of the performance where Sandler has to stop in the middle of a song due to becoming distracted with the audience's rhythmic clapping.

Photo taken in 1907 Anti-Qing sentiment () refers to a sentiment principally held in China against Manchu rule during the Qing dynasty (1636‚Äì1912), which was criticized by opponents as being barbaric. The Qing was accused of destroying traditional Han culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a queue in the Manchu style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, causing China to be transformed from the world's premiere power to a poor, backwards nation. The people of the Eight Banners lived off government pensions unlike the general Han civilian population. The rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was \\"F«én Qƒ´ng f√π M√≠ng\\" (simplified Chinese: ÂèçÊ∏ÖÂ§çÊòé; traditional Chinese: ÂèçÊ∏ÖÂæ©Êòé; literally: \\"Oppose Qing and restore Ming\\"), related to the Boxer Rebellion slogan \\"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\\" (\\"Êâ∂Ê∏ÖÊªÖÊ¥ã f√∫ Qƒ´ng mi√® y√°ng\\"). In the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu direct action. This included people from many mainstream political movements and uprisings, such as Taiping Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution, the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Revive China Society, the Tongmenghui, the Panthay Rebellion, White Lotus Rebellion, and others.  Ming loyalism in the early Qing  Statue of Zheng Chenggong on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, one of many in mainland China and Taiwan.  Muslim Ming loyalists  Hui Muslim Ming loyalists under Mi Layin and Ding Guodong fought against the Qing to restore a Ming prince to the throne from 1646‚Äì1650. When the Qing dynasty invaded the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin and Ding Guodong led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by Hami's Sultan Sa'id Baba and his son Prince Turumtay. The Muslim Ming loyalists were joined by Tibetans and Han Chinese in the revolt. After fierce fighting, and negotiations, a peace agreement was agreed on in 1649, and Milayan and Ding nominally pledged allegiance to the Qing and were given ranks as members of the Qing military. When other Ming loyalists in southern China made a resurgence and the Qing were forced to withdraw their forces from Gansu to fight them, Milayan and Ding once again took up arms and rebelled against the Qing. The Muslim Ming loyalists were then crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin, Ding Guodong, and Turumtay killed in battle. The Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu (1640‚Äì1710) served with the southern Ming loyalists against the Qing.  Koxinga  The Ming loyalist general Zheng Chenggong, better known by his title Koxinga, led a military movement to oppose the Qing dynasty from 1646 to 1662. He established the Kingdom of Tungning on the island of Taiwan.  Joseon  Joseon Korea operated within the Ming tributary system and had a strong alliance with the Ming during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). This put Joseon in a dilemma when both Nurhaci and the Ming requested support. Gwanghaegun of Joseon tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally. In 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by King Injo (r. 1623‚Äì1649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander Yi Gwal erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders. The Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu queue. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of Neo-Confucianism.  Anti-Qing rebellions   Mongol Rebellions  The Mongols under Qing rule were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer Khalkha Mongols, and the Eastern Oirat Mongols. The Inner Mongolian Chahar Khan Ligdan Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son Ejei Khan surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, Ë¶™Áéã), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in Shenyang and the Kangxi Emperor gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy. The Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the Kangxi Emperor after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol Dzungar Khanate under its leader Galdan. The Oirat Khoshut Upper Mongols in Qinghai rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor but were crushed and defeated. Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator The Oirat Mongol Dzungars in the Dzungar Khanate offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the Dzungar genocide. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince Ching√ºnjav had plotted with the Dzungar leader Amursana and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Ching√ºnjav and his entire family. During the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu Ambans.  Taiping Rebellion  A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \\"Heavenly King\\" (ca. 1860) Hong Xiuquan (Ê¥™ÁßÄÂÖ®, H√≥ng Xi√πqu√°n) was a Hakka Chinese who was the leader of the Taiping Rebellion (1850‚Äì1864) against the Qing dynasty. He proclaimed himself to be the Heavenly King, established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and called Jesus Christ his brother. = Genocide and extermination of Manchus = Driven by their fierce hatred of Manchus, the Taiping launched a massive genocide campaign against the Manchus to exterminate their entire race. The genocide of Manchus was incredible, in every area they captured, the Taiping immediately rushed into the Manchu fort in order to kill all the Manchus. One Qing loyalist observed in the province of Hunan of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \\"pitiful Manchus\\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once Hefei capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \\"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there. Ningbo's entire Manchu population was also annihilated. After conquering Nanjing, Taiping forces stormed the Manchu fort, killing some 40,000 Manchus, which was the city's entire population of Manchus. On 27 October 1853 they crossed the Yellow River in T'sang-chou and butchered about 10,000 Manchus. In Shaoxing 2,000 Manchus were also killed.  Red Turban Rebellion (1854‚Äì1856)  When news reached their ears that the Taipings succeeded in conquered Nanjing, the anti-Manchu Cantonese in the Pearl River Delta saw this as an opportunity and possibility of overthrowing the Manchus to restore Han rule over China, and began the Red Turban Rebellion (1854‚Äì1856). These rebels were called 'Red Turbans' because of the red headscarves they wore. The Red Turban Rebellion was initially quite successful as the rebels gained control of a considerable amount of territory. On July 1854, Foshan was occupied by the rebel. In a desperate attempt to the eradicate any facilities which may support the Red Turbans, the Qing forces burnt the northern suburbs in Guangzhou to prevent it from sheltering the rebels. The rebellion was ultimately defeated in 1856, which was followed by the mass execution of suspected sympathisers and participants of the rebellion.  Panthay Rebellion  The Panthay Rebellion leader Du Wenxiu declared his intention of overthrowing the Qing and driving the Manchus out of China. The rebellion started after massacres of Hui perpetrated by the Manchu authorities. Du used anti-Manchu rhetoric in his rebellion against the Qing, calling for Han to join the Hui to overthrow the Manchu Qing after 200 years of their rule. Du invited the fellow Hui Muslim leader Ma Rulong to join him in driving the Manchu Qing out and \\"recover China\\". For his war against Manchu \\"oppression\\", Du \\"became a Muslim hero\\", while Ma Rulong defected to the Qing. On multiple occasions Kunming was attacked and sacked by Du Wenxiu's forces. His capital was Dali. The revolt ended in 1873. Du Wenxiu is regarded as a hero by the present day government of China.  Tibetan rebellions  Tibetan Buddhist Lamas rebelled against the Qing at Batang during the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion, assassinating the Manchu leader Fengquan, and also killing French Catholic missionaries and Tibetan converts to Catholicism.  Late-Qing revolutionaries   Sun Yat-sen   Zou Rong  Born in Sichuan province in West China in 1885 to a merchant family, Zou (1885‚Äì1905) received a classical education but refused to sit for the civil service exams. He worked as a seal carver while pursuing classical studies. He gradually became interested in Western ideas and went to Japan to study in 1901, where he was exposed to radical revolutionary and anti-Manchu ideas. Here are some quotations of Zou Rong: \\"Sweep away millennia of despotism in all its forms, throw off millennia of slavishness, annihilate the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleanse ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain\\" \\"I do not begrudge repeating over and over again that internally we are slaves of the Manchus and suffering from their tyranny, externally we are being harassed by the Powers, and we are doubly enslaved.\\" \\"Kill the emperor set up by the Manchus as a warning to the myriad generations that despotic government is not to be revived.\\" \\"Settle the name of the country as the Republic of China.\\"  Overthrow of the Qing  Celebrations in Nanjing Road, Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution, 1911 The Xinhai Revolution () of 1911 was catalysed by the triumph of the Wuchang Uprising, when the victorious Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the other provinces asking them to declare their independence, and 15 provinces in Southern China and Central China did so.Liu, Haiming. [2005] (2005). The Transnational History of a Chinese Family: Immigrant Letters, Family Business and Reverse Migration. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. , . Xinhai revolutionaries launched mass massacres against the Manchus across Chinese cities. These notorious massacres of Manchus include which happened in Wuhan where some 10,000 Manchus were butchered and the massacre of some 20,000 Manchus in Xi'an. The Hui Muslim community was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing. The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an (Shaanxi province) joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the entire 20,000 Manchu population of Xi'an. The native Hui Muslims of Gansu province led by general Ma Anliang sided with the Qing and prepared to attack the anti-Qing revolutionaries of Xi'an city. Only a few wealthy Manchus were held for ransom and some Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims. Finally after more than two centuries, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and China was established into a new republic. Texts which contained anti-Manchu content were banned by President Yuan Shikai during Republican rule.

It folded in 2006,Rob O'Flanagan, \\"Elliot Lake art school didn't have a chance: Academy never had enough money or students\\", Sudbury Star, 15 February 2006, A4; Rob O'Flanagan, \\"Good-bye White Mountain: Loss of Elliot Lake arts academy will be felt across Northern Ontario\\", Sudbury Star, 12 April 2006, A4.

During its operation, however, it did grant its own certificates and diplomas, and offered degree programming in collaboration with OCAD University in Toronto, leading to a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA). It only offered its four-year program to one cohort of eleven students. However, many subsequently transferred to OCAD in Toronto or other fine arts programs.\\"White Mountain‚Äôs fate in council‚Äôs hands\\". Elliot Lake Standard, January 21, 2015. The White Mountain Campus Originally housing a nuclear research laboratory, the building features three naturally lit floors with several rooms from each floor, centred upon a massive arboretum, spanning the steps from the first to second floors. After the school's closure, the building was subsequently leased by the city, and served primarily as a storage depot for municipal equipment. Beginning in 2012, the White Mountain building became a temporary home to the Elliot Lake Public Library and other services displaced by the Algo Centre Mall roof collapse.\\"Library board votes to stay at White Mountain\\". Elliot Lake Standard, September 18, 2013. Having been shut for several years, the building required significant renovations for this purpose. The library faced controversy over its planned final location in 2013, with the board favouring remaining at White Mountain while many users preferred a move to the more centrally-located Pearson Plaza.\\"White Mountain not most suitable location for library\\". Elliot Lake Standard, October 24, 2013. The library ultimately announced that it would move to Pearson Plaza, after White Mountain declined to offer the institution a long-term stable lease.\\"Library board votes to enter lease for Pearson Plaza, Council unanimously supports library board‚Äôs decision\\". Elliot Lake Standard, November 27, 2013. Elliot Lake's city council subsequently faced controversy around significant cost overruns in the 2012 renovation project, as well as other municipal investments in the building and its maintenance. As at October 2016, the building remains in use providing host to a variety of tenants, including the Nuclear Waste Management Organisation, Service Canada, a dance studio, the business incubator and some of their clients. The board, officially the Northern Institute of the Arts, remains active whilst plans are to dissolve the board after the sale of an art collection. The building, now owned by the city of Elliot Lake, was reported as having been sold for $200,000 to a multinational firm, Eissa Group. It was later clarified in council that this was misreported in that it was not sold yet, but only a conditional offer made.

It was reprinted as a separate volume in 1935 with 18 illustrations by W. Siegfried. Interested in cinematography he started his activity as film critic in 1931 when he was appointed by \\"Radio Rom√¢nia\\" and started the first broadcast critics in Romania. He also contributed with film critics to various Romanian magazines. In 1934 he also wrote his first screenplay for a documentary film \\"Romania\\" ‚Äì directed by Paul CƒÉlinescu and Jean Mihail. In 1935 he published his first volume about films: \\"The Fairytale factory\\" ()Desene animate The same year, he published his only play \\"Dri-dri\\" which was awarded the prize of the \\"Society of Romanian Dramaturgists\\" (Societatea Autorilor Dramatici Rom√¢ni) for one-act plays. Film producer and director  In 1941, Ion Cantacuzino was appointed director of the \\"National Office of Cinematography\\" which had been created in the late 1930s. The main activity of the Office was to release newsreels about the World War II. Besides coordinating the activity of the office, Ion Cantacuzino wrote the screenplays, directed and produced documentaries having cultural subjects: \\"The Pele≈ü Castle\\" (Castelul Pele≈ü) ‚Äì 1941 or \\"Old Customs\\" (Datini din strƒÉbuni) ‚Äì 1942 or related to the war: \\"Romania in war against bolshevism\\" (Rom√¢nia √Æn lupta contra bol≈üevismului) ‚Äì 1941, \\"Our sacred war\\" (RƒÉzboiul nostru sf√¢nt) ‚Äì 1942, \\"We\\" (Noi) ‚Äì 1942. Ion Cantacuzino's ambitions were however related to the production of feature films. In 1943 he produced the film \\"Stormy Night\\" (O noapte furtunoasƒÉ), a comedy based on a play by Ion Luca Caragiale directed by Jean Georgescu. He then created the Romanian- Italian film production and distribution company \\"Cineromit\\". The first coproduction was \\"Odessa in Flames\\" (Odessa in fiamme) directed by Carmine Gallone on a screenplay by Gherardo Gherardi and Nicolae Kiri≈£escu. The next production of \\"Cineromit\\" was scheduled to be produced in Romania. A second film, \\"The white squadron\\" (Squadriglia bianca), directed by Romanian director Ion Sava was released in 1944. The same year, Ion Cantacuzino, as producer, selected Jean Georgescu to direct the film \\"A Winter Night's Dream\\" (Visul unei nop≈£i de iarnƒÉ) based on a play by Tudor Mu»ôatescu. Due to the war, the film could be completed only in 1945. Another project which Ion Cantacuzino was negotiating with the Italians was a historical drama on the life of Stephen the Great, based on a screenplay by Camil Petrescu, starring Amedeo Nazzari and Alida Valli. This project had to be abandoned due to the war. Ion Cantacuzino was also planning to create, in cooperation with the Italians a center for the production of feature films in Romania. The plans for the construction of the center had been designed by architect Octav Doicescu and the Italian government had promised to provide the equipment. The project could not be finalized due to the war.BrƒÉtescu, Gheorghe ‚Äì Odessa √Æn flƒÉcƒÉri ‚Äì Clipa No. 643, March 25, 2004 CINEROMIT ‚Äì le r√™ve de la Cinecitt√† roumaine ‚Äì 1941‚Äì1946 Activity after 1945 After the rise to power of the communist regime in Romania, Ion Cantacuzino was blacklisted, because of both his aristocratic background and his antisoviet attitude during the war years. He was arrested for a short time. After his release, he reverted to his second profession and worked for the rest of his life as a psychiatrist at the \\"Br√¢ncovenesc Hospital\\" in Bucharest.

Marslen-Wilson and Alan Welsh (1978) Processing Interactions and Lexical Access during Word Recognition in Continuous Speech. Cognitive Psychology,10,29‚Äì63 It attempts to describe how visual or auditory input (i.e., hearing or reading a word) is mapped onto a word in a hearer's lexicon. According to the model, when a person hears speech segments real-time, each speech segment \\"activates\\" every word in the lexicon that begins with that segment, and as more segments are added, more words are ruled out, until only one word is left that still matches the input. Background information The cohort model relies on a number of concepts in the theory of lexical retrieval. The lexicon is the store of words in a person's mind.;, The Free Dictionary it contains a person's vocabulary and is similar to a mental dictionary. A lexical entry is all the information about a word and the lexical storage is the way the items are stored for peak retrieval. Lexical access is the way that an individual accesses the information in the mental lexicon. A word's cohort is composed of all the lexical items that share an initial sequence of phonemes,^ Fernandez, E.M. & Smith Cairns, H. (2011). Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics (Malden, MZ: Wiley-Blackwell). ( and is the set of words activated by the initial phonemes of the word. Model The cohort model is based on the concept that auditory or visual input to the brain stimulates neurons as it enters the brain, rather than at the end of a word.Altmann, 71. This fact was demonstrated in the 1980s through experiments with speech shadowing, in which subjects listened to recordings and were instructed to repeat aloud exactly what they heard, as quickly as possible; Marslen-Wilson found that the subjects often started to repeat a word before it had actually finished playing, which suggested that the word in the hearer's lexicon was activated before the entire word had been heard.Altmann, 70. Findings such as these led Marslen-Wilson to propose the cohort model in 1987.Marslen-Wilson, W. (1987). \\"Functional parallelism in spoken word recognition.\\" Cognition, 25, 71-102. The cohort model consists of three stages: access, selection, and integration. Under this model, auditory lexical retrieval begins with the first one or two speech segments, or phonemes, reach the hearer's ear, at which time the mental lexicon activates every possible word that begins with that speech segment.Packard, 288. This occurs during the \\"access stage\\" and all of the possible words are known as the cohort.HARLEY, T. A. (2009). Psychology of language, from data to theory. New York: Psychology Pr. The words that are activated by the speech signal but are not the intended word are often called \\"competitors.\\" Identification of the target word is more difficult with more competitors.http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/cm/lectures/cm19_wordrec-2x2.pdf, Goldwater, Sharon (2010). As more speech segments enter the ear and stimulate more neurons, causing the competitors that no longer match the input to be \\"kicked out\\" or to decrease in activation.Altmann, 74. The processes by which words are activated and competitors rejected in the cohort model are frequently called \\"activation and selection\\" or \\"recognition and competition\\". These processes continue until an instant, called the recognition point, at which only one word remains activated and all competitors have been kicked out. The recognition point process is initiated within the first 200 to 250 milliseconds of the onset of the given word.Fernandez, E.M. & Smith Cairns, H. (2011). Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics (Malden, MZ: Wiley-Blackwell). ( This is also known as the uniqueness point and it is the point where the most processing occurs. Moreover, there is a difference in the way a word is processed before it reaches its recognition point and afterwards. One can look at the process prior to reaching the recognition point as bottom-up, where the phonemes are used to access the lexicon. The post recognition point process is top-down, because the information concerning the chosen word is tested against the word that is presented.Taft, M., & Hambly, G. (1986). Exploring the cohort model of spoken word recognition. Cognition, 22(3), 259-282. The selection stage occurs when only one word is left from the set. Finally, in the integration stage, the semantic and syntactic properties of activated words are incorporated into the high-level utterance representation. Increasing segments of the word, \\"candle\\"For example, in the auditory recognition of the word \\"candle\\", the following steps take place. When the hearer hears the first two phonemes and ((1) and (2) in the image), he or she would activate the word \\"candle\\", along with competitors such as \\"candy\\", \\"can\\", \\"cattle\\", and numerous others. Once the phoneme is added ((3) in the image), \\"cattle\\" would be kicked out; with , \\"can\\" would be kicked out; and this process would continue until the recognition point, the final of \\"candle\\", were reached ((5) in the image).Brysbaert, Marc, and Ton Dijkstra (2006). \\"Changing views on word recognition in bilinguals.\\" in Bilingualism and second language acquisition, eds. Morais, J. & d‚ÄôYdewalle, G. Brussels: KVAB. The recognition point need not always be the final phoneme of the word; the recognition point of \\"slander\\", for example, occurs at the (since no other English words begin \\"sland-\\"); all competitors for \\"spaghetti\\" are ruled out as early as ; Jerome Packard has demonstrated that the recognition point of the Chinese word hu≈èchƒì (\\"train\\") occurs before hu≈èch-;Packard, 289. and a landmark study by Pienie Zwitserlood demonstrated that the recognition point of the Dutch word kapitein (captain) was at the vowel before the final .Altmann, 72. Since its original proposal, the model has been adjusted to allow for the role that context plays in helping the hearer rule out competitors, and the fact that activation is \\"tolerant\\" to minor acoustic mismatches that arise because of coarticulation (a property by which language sounds are slightly changed by the sounds preceding and following them).Altmann, 75. Experimental evidence Much evidence in favor of the cohort model has come from priming studies, in which a \\"priming word\\" is presented to a subject and then closely followed by a \\"target word\\" and the subject asked to identify if the target word is a real word or not; the theory behind the priming paradigm is that if a word is activated in the subject's mental lexicon, the subject will be able to respond more quickly to the target word.Packard, 295. If the subject does respond more quickly, the target word is said to be \\"primed\\" by the priming word. Several priming studies have found that when a stimulus that does not reach recognition point is presented, numerous words targets were all primed, whereas if a stimulus past recognition point is presented, only one word is primed. For example, in Pienie Zwitserlood's study of Dutch compared the words kapitein (\\"captain\\") and kapitaal (\\"capital\\" or \\"money\\"); in the study, the stem kapit- primed both boot (\\"boat\\", semantically related to kapitein) and geld (\\"money\\", semantically related to kapitaal), suggesting that both lexical entries were activated; the full word kapitein, on the other hand, primed only boot and not geld. Furthermore, experiments have shown that in tasks where subjects must differentiate between words and non-words, reaction times were faster for longer words with phonemic points of discrimination earlier in the word. For example, discriminating between Crocodile and Dial, the point of recognition to discriminate between the two words comes at the /d/ in crocodile which is much earlier than the /l/ sound in Dial.Taft, 264. Later experiments refined the model. For example, some studies showed that \\"shadowers\\" (subjects who listen to auditory stimuli and repeat it as quickly as possible) could not shadow as quickly when words were jumbled up so they didn't mean anything; those results suggested that sentence structure and speech context also contribute to the process of activation and selection. Research in bilinguals has found that word recognition is influenced by the number of neighbors in both languages.Van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., & Grainger, J. (1998). \\"Orthographic Neighborhood Effects in Bilingual Word Recognition.\\" Journal of Memory and Language. pp. 458-483.  References  *Altmann, Gerry T.M.

It is their last full-length to date, and the group was condensed to a duo, with James Plotkin handling all instruments and Alan Dubin handling all vocals. The album is a rather drastic departure from OLD's earlier works, abandoning much of their extreme metal roots to instead explore techno, IDM and electro, with Dubin's vocals processed through a Vocoder. According to Terrorizer Magazine (article named \\"Lost Classics & Follies\\"), it is allegedly the lowest-selling album in the history of Earache Records. Though not well received at the time of its release, retrospective reviews are more positive. Allmusic referred to the album as a notable precursor of industrial techno.

History DART was founded in 1973 as the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority, commonly known as the MTA. Formed by a partnership of the cities of Des Moines, West Des Moines, Clive, Windsor Heights, and Urbandale. The MTA eventually developed a 14-county carpool and vanpool system in addition to its bus system. By 2006, population growth in varying regions of central Iowa led to Polk County and nineteen cities forming a regional transportation agency following changes to Iowa law in 2005. Sunday service was added for the first time in 2007. In 2008, a free shuttle linked downtown Des Moines with the Iowa State Capitol. In 2012, a $21 million bus transfer station was opened on the south end of downtown, ending decades of using Walnut Street as a transit mall. DART Central Station serves as a major hub for many of DART's local buses. Today, DART services Altoona, Ankeny, Bondurant, Clive, Des Moines, Grimes, Johnston, Pleasant Hill, Polk County, Urbandale, West Des Moines and Windsor Heights. DART is represented by a board of 12 Commissioners, one from each member government it serves. Commission meetings are open to the public, and information can be found on the DART website. Structure DART utilizes a hub and spoke system, designed to favor commuters, as opposed to point-to-point system. Most local routes run through downtown Des Moines. DART also has express routes that stop in Downtown Des Moines and On Call routes that operate within specific zones in the Greater Des Moines area.

Wrong was the author of several books, including two essay collections containing articles first published in cultural, intellectual, political and scholarly journals in the United States, Canada, and Britain.The New York Times (November 11, 2018) Dennis Wrong Dead Life Dennis was the son of Humphrey Hume Wrong and Mary Joyce (Hutton) Wrong. First studying in Toronto, his father was a diplomat in Washington and Geneva where Dennis's study continued. He harvested wheat during WWII and earned a bachelor's degree from University of Toronto in 1945. During graduate study at Columbia University he was influenced by C. Wright Mills and Robert K. Merton, gaining the Ph.D. in 1956. He lived in Greenwich Village, NYC, socializing with novelists. In the considerations of socialization, Dennis Wrong believed the observance of norms noted by Talcott Parsons was a concept of oversocialization. His 1961 essay on the topic was widely noted and Wrong expanded the essay to a book in 1976. He taught sociology at Princeton University, Rutgers, Brown University, the University of Toronto, the New School for Social Research Graduate Faculty, and for most of his career at New York University. Wrong was a permanent editor at Dissent (magazine). The Dennis Wrong Award is given for the best graduate paper of the year by New York University's sociology department. Work Wrong is best known for a 1961 article, \\"The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology.\\" This summarized his critique of the limitations of structural functionalism employed by Talcott Parsons. In 1968 Wrong began to write on power (social and political) with a contribution to American Journal of Sociology.D. Wrong (1968) \\"Some problems in defining social power\\", American Journal of Sociology 73(6): 673‚Äì81 The article argued that power is not asymmetrical except in cases of physical violence. It distinguished power from control and potential from possible powers. He cited Bertrand Russell (1938) Power: a new social analysis and Nelson W. Polsby (1963) Community Power and Social Theory. In 1979, he published Power: its forms, bases, and uses which was widely reviewed. For example, Jennie M. Hornosty criticized the book for its lack of discussion of class conflict, digression into peripheral issues, and weakness on the social-structural variants of power.Jennie M. Hornosty (1981) Canadian Journal of Sociology 6(2) Michael Mann criticized it for incompleteness, though he praised the first 159 pages. In Mann's view Wrong's view descends into an analysis of aggregates of individuals at the end. He expected more description of the complex and interpenetrating relations between classes, states, churches, communities, and bureaucracies.Michael Mann (1983) American Journal of Sociology 88(5): 1030‚Äì2 Wrong described his 1994 book The Problem of Order as \\"a sequel to, or enlargement upon\\" his 1961 article.D. Wrong, The Problem of Order, The Free Press/Macmillan, 1994, p.ix. The book considers a number of theorists and writers, including Hobbes, Rousseau, Freud, and Parsons. In his discussion of Freud and in particular Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, Wrong observes that one may \\"accept the substance of Freud's emphasis on conflict and ambivalence\\" while rejecting some of Freud's formulations in Civilization about \\"nature\\" versus \\"culture.\\"Ibid., p.153. Nature and culture are both \\"riven with conflicts that cut across one another, so the simple dichotomy of nature versus culture so often represented as the essence of Freud's social theory is not tenable.\\"Ibid., p.155. Quotes In his book Power... Wrong argued: > It has been argued that, like \\"freedom\\" or \\"justice\\" ‚Äì those \\"big words > which make us so unhappy\\", as Stephen Dedalus called them ‚Äì \\"power\\" is an > \\"essentially contested concept\\", meaning that people with different values > and beliefs are bound to disagree over its nature and definition. It is > claimed therefore that there cannot be any commonly accepted or even > preferred meaning so long as people differ on normative issues as they are > likely to do indefinitely, if not forever. \\"Power\\", however, does not seem > to me to be an inherently normative concept. [...] its scope and > pervasiveness, its involvement in any and all spheres of social life, give > it almost unavoidable evaluative overtones. Positive or negative, benign or > malign, auras come to envelop it, linking it still more closely to > ideological controversy. Yet power as a generic attribute of social life is > surely more like the concepts of \\"society\\", \\"group\\" or \\"social norm\\" than > like such essentially and inescapably normative notions as \\"justice\\", > \\"democracy\\" or \\"human rights\\". (Wrong 2002: viii)  Family  He was the father of documentary filmmaker Terence Wrong, the grandson of George Mackinnon Wrong, Canadian historian, and son of Humphrey Hume Wrong, Canadian Ambassador to the United States.

Early life Morse was born in Boston, and spent his childhood there. He attended Harvard University, graduating in 1858 with a B.S. degree. Civil War Soon after the start of the Civil War in 1861, Morse joined the 2nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, where he fought alongside some of his Harvard classmates, including the future colonel of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Robert Gould Shaw. The two became close friends, maintaining near-daily correspondence until the latter's death in the Battle of Fort Wagner in July 1863. Morse was promoted to captain of the regiment's Company B, and served in this role at the battles of Cedar Mountain, Antietam, and Chancellorsville. After Gettysburg, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 2nd Massachusetts, a rank he held until the end of the war. During the Atlanta campaign waged by Union General William T. Sherman in 1864, Morse served as provost marshal of the city following its burning and Union occupation, where \\"[b]y all accounts, [he] kept strict order.\\" Business career After the war, Morse tried his hand at cotton farming in Georgia, but was unsuccessful. He traveled west in 1870 and found greater success in a series of positions in the railroad business. In 1878, Morse left his post as general manager of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in Topeka, Kansas at the suggestion of his friend, Charles Francis Adams, Jr., and relocated to Kansas City, where he served first as general manager and eventually president of the Kansas City Stockyards. Morse also served for several years as president of the Kansas City Metropolitan Street Railway company. He was one of the first residents of the city's exclusive Hyde Park district, a gated suburb established outside the city limits near the frontier town of Westport in 1882. During the 1880s and 1890s, Col. Morse helped establish several elite civic institutions, including The Barstow School and the Kansas City Country Club. Morse maintained a summer residence in Falmouth, Massachusetts, to which he retired in 1913.A sketch of my life written for my children and A buffalo hunt in Nebraska in 1871 (Cambridge : Privately printed at the Riverside Press, 1927). In popular culture A young Captain Morse was portrayed by Donovan Leitch, Jr. in the 1989 film Glory, though this appearance was fictionalized. (Morse is shown as an officer of the 54th Mass., while in reality he never left the 2nd Mass and never participated in the attack on Fort Wagner.) His battlefield letters to Robert Gould Shaw served as primary sources for the books that inspired the film. Lt. Colonel Morse is cited in several sections of the 2009 non-fiction novel, The Bonfire - The Siege and Burning of Atlanta, written by Marc Wortman. Lt. Colonel Morse appears in the Index eighteen times, which provides quotations and references to his military role in the Union Army and as the Provost Marshal of Atlanta following the battle of Atlanta.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/08/21/AR2009082101114.html.

Another interpretation of the theorem is that the ground electronic states solved by one-particle methods (such as HF or DFT) already imply configuration interaction of the ground-state configuration with the singly excited ones. That renders their further inclusion into the CI expansion redundant. Proof The electronic Hamiltonian of the system can be divided into two parts: one consisting of one-electron operators h(1)=-\\\\frac{1}{2} abla^2_1 - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{Z_\\\\alpha}{r_{1\\\\alpha}} and the other of two-electron operators \\\\sum_{j} r_1-r_j^{-1}. In methods of wavefunction-based quantum chemistry which include the electron correlation into the model, the wavefunction is expressed as a sum of series consisting of different Slater determinants (i.e., a linear combination of such determinants). In the simplest case of configuration interaction (as well as in other single- reference multielectron-basis set methods, like MPn, etc.), all the determinants contain the same one-electron functions, or orbitals, and differ just by occupation of these orbitals by electrons. The source of these orbitals is the converged Hartree‚ÄìFock calculation, which gives the so-called reference determinant \\\\left \\\\psi_0 \\\\right \\\\rangle with all the electrons occupying energetically lowest states among the available. All other determinants are then made by formally \\"exciting\\" the reference one (one or more electrons are cleared from one-electron states occupied in \\\\left \\\\psi_0 \\\\right \\\\rangle and put into states unoccupied in \\\\left \\\\psi_0 \\\\right \\\\rangle). As the orbitals remain the same, we can simply transition from the many-electron state basis (\\\\left \\\\psi_0 \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\left \\\\psi_a^r \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\left \\\\psi_{ab}^{rs} \\\\right \\\\rangle, ‚Ä¶) to the one-electron state basis (which was used for Hartree‚ÄìFock: \\\\left a \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\left b \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\left r \\\\right \\\\rangle, \\\\left s \\\\right \\\\rangle, ‚Ä¶), greatly improving the efficiency of calculations. For this transition, we apply the Slater‚ÄìCondon rules and evaluate ::\\\\langle \\\\psi_0\\\\hat{H} \\\\psi_a^r \\\\rangle = \\\\langle ahr \\\\rangle + \\\\sum_b \\\\langle ab  rb \\\\rangle = \\\\langle ahr \\\\rangle + \\\\sum_b \\\\left ( \\\\langle ab  rb \\\\rangle - \\\\langle ab  br \\\\rangle \\\\right ) = \\\\langle ahr\\\\rangle + \\\\sum_b \\\\left ( \\\\langle a  2 \\\\hat{J}_b - \\\\hat{K}_b  r \\\\rangle \\\\right ) which we recognize is simply an off-diagonal element of the Fock matrix \\\\langle \\\\chi_a\\\\hat{F}\\\\chi_r \\\\rangle . But the reference wave function was obtained by the Hartree‚ÄìFock calculation, or the SCF procedure, the whole point of which was to diagonalize the Fock matrix. Hence for an optimized wavefunction this off-diagonal element must be zero. This can be made evident also if we multiply both sides of a Hartree‚ÄìFock equation ::\\\\hat{F} \\\\chi_r = \\\\epsilon_r \\\\chi_r by \\\\chi_a^{\\\\ast}(\\\\vec{r}) and integrate over the electronic coordinate: ::\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\chi_a^{\\\\ast}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\hat{F} \\\\chi_r(\\\\vec{r}) d^3 \\\\vec{r} = \\\\epsilon_r \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\chi_a^{\\\\ast}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\chi_r(\\\\vec{r}) d^3 \\\\vec{r}. As the Fock matrix has already been diagonalized, the states \\\\chi_r^{\\\\ast}(\\\\vec{r}) and \\\\chi_a(\\\\vec{r}) are the eigenstates of the Fock operator, and as such are orthogonal; thus their overlap is zero. It makes all the right-hand side of the equation zero: ::\\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\chi_a^{\\\\ast}(\\\\vec{r}) \\\\hat{F} \\\\chi_r(\\\\vec{r}) d^3 \\\\vec{r} = \\\\langle \\\\psi_0\\\\hat{H} \\\\psi_a^r \\\\rangle = 0, which proves the Brillouin's theorem. The theorem have also been proven directly from the variational principle (by Mayer) and is essentially equivalent to the Hartree‚ÄìFock equations in general.

The outer wall of the amphitheatre was partially felled, and the standing portion was damaged in a later earthquake of 1183. Many other churches, monasteries, and ancient monuments were destroyed or seriously damaged, eliminating much of Verona's early medieval architecture and providing space for a massive Romanesque rebuilding.G. Solinas (1981), Storia di Verona (Verona: Centro Rinascita), 244. The late eight- or early ninth-century Versus de Verona contains a now indispensable description of Verona's early medieval architecture, including Roman ruins. After the first shock of 3 January, seismic activity persisted for months, striking on 12 January, 4 June, 1 July, 1 October, and 30 December. The earthquake was not only felt in Verona but across northern Italy, from Cividale to Pavia, south to Pisa and north to Switzerland.http://www.ips.it/scuola/concorso/terremoti/home4.htm Outside of Verona the most damaged areas were Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Venice, Treviso, Modena, Parma, and Cremona. The main churches of Padua all suffered major damage. News of the earthquake reached Montecassino and Reims.Emanuela Guidoboni-Enzo Boschi (1989), \\"I grandi terremoti medioevali in Italia,\\" Le Scienze, 249. The Milanese chronicler Landolfo Iuniore reported that the church synods needed to be carried out in the open air, due to the destruction. In Germany, damage was also extensive. The Michaelskirche in Bamberg, the abbey at Brauweiler, and buildings in Rottenburg am Neckar, Constance, Meersburg, and F√©nis were all reported damaged.Thomas Glade, Malcolm Anderson, Michael J. Crozier (2005), Landslide Hazard and Risk (John Wiley and Sons, ), 261. Recent studies, however, suggest that it was not a major, single event on 3 January, but instead a series of shocks in the areas of Verona (west Veneto) and Cremona (Lower Lombardy), which happened in a few days or even in a few hours. Other earthquakes may have hit as far south as Pisa (northwest Tuscany) and as north as Augsburg (southwest Bavaria), as distinct events, in the same days.P.

The 38th overall episode of the series was written by executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by series producer Don Scardino. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 6, 2008. Guest stars in this episode include Remy Auberjonois, Todd Buonopane, Raven Goodwin, and Oprah Winfrey. The episode's plot concerns a feud between Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) over royalties from Tracy's pornographic video game Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) attempts to settle the fight with the help of Oprah Winfrey, whom she meets on a return flight from Chicago. Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is stung by the revelation that most events from the 2008 Summer Olympics were staged to boost America's image and NBC's ratings. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) attempts to break Kenneth of his moral absolutism. \\"Believe in the Stars\\" received generally positive reception from television critics, with Neal Justin of the Star Tribune concluding it was \\"the most brilliant episode in the series' history\\". According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 8.0 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.9 rating/9 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. On June 22, 2020, it was revealed that this was one of three episodes being pulled from syndication and repeats due to the scene of Jenna wearing blackface. Plot The episode starts with Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announcing to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), that she needs to go to Chicago for jury duty because she is still registered to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful sedative for the trip. Later, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in tetherball, Tyler Brody (Remy Auberjonois). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and is threatening to go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic tetherball competition during the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. Jack makes a deal with Brody, but is bothered when Kenneth tells him that he no longer looks up to him over the morally grey actions. In an attempt to break Kenneth's moral absolutism, Jack stages a gambit where nine people are trapped in an elevator with enough air for eight, and Kenneth shows no hesitation in sacrificing himself. Jack concedes that Kenneth is better than him, and gives him a big screen television as a gift, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if SpongeBob SquarePants \\"is supposed to be terrifying\\". Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands compensation for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders them to stop their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman sitting next to her is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, will be able to make them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences. Production Oprah Winfrey guest starred in this episode. \\"Believe in the Stars\\" was written by executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by series producer Don Scardino. This episode was Carlock's ninth writing credit, and was Scardino's fifteenth directed episode. \\"Believe in the Stars\\" originally aired in the United States on November 6, 2008 on NBC as the second episode of the show's third season and the 38th overall episode of the series. In September 2008, it was announced that television host Oprah Winfrey would guest star on the show. She filmed her appearance on September 13, 2008. When Winfrey interviewed series creator Tina Fey on her show in November, Fey revealed that they shot their scene together on a Saturday, a day that the show normally does not film on. Actress Raven Goodwin played Pam, a 12-year-old girl that, while hallucinating, Liz Lemon believed was Oprah. Actor Remy Auberjonois played Olympic medalist Tyler Brody in this episode. This was actor Todd Buonopane's debut as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human Resource mediator. In \\"Believe in the Stars\\", Jeffrey tries to mediate the disagreement that Jenna and Tracy are having over the video game. Buonopane later guest starred in the episodes \\"Cutbacks\\" and \\"Jackie Jormp-Jomp\\". Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens, and in this episode while trying to get out of jury duty in Chicago. Star Wars is also referenced when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". She said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". She attributed most of the references to Carlock, whom she described as \\"the resident expert\\". Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Believe in the Stars\\" was watched by 8.0 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 3.9 rating/9 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a decrease from the season premiere episode, \\"Do-Over\\", which was watched by 8.7 million American viewers. Nonetheless, this episode was the eighth highest- rated show on the NBC network during the week of November 3‚Äì9, 2008. Since airing, \\"Believe in the Stars\\" has received positive reception from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised the episode, saying that it was \\"an absolutely perfect episode with not a moment wasted [and] equally hilarious were the storylines between Jack and Kenneth, and Tracy and Jenna. The episode had everything that makes 30 Rock great.\\" Canning opined that Liz's admissions to Oprah Winfrey were \\"painfully funny\\", and that Tracy \\"was on fire\\" following his actions in this episode. In conclusion, Canning gave it a 10 out of 10 rating. Jeremy Medina of Paste was complimentary towards the episode, reporting that it had \\"madcap humor tirelessly delivered one joke after another at a lightning fast speed, adding up to one of the funniest episodes in the series.\\" Medina enjoyed the social experiment between Jenna and Tracy, noting that it was \\"hilarious\\". TV Guide's Matt Mitovich commented that the episode was \\"Rock-solid\\", while Neal Justin of the Star Tribune believed it was \\"the most brilliant episode in the series' history\\". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that \\"Believe in the Stars\\" belonged to Tina Fey \\"who has grown by leaps and bounds as an actress over the past few years. The Princess Leia voice, her drunken panic on the plane [...] and the religious fervor at the knowledge that Oprah would be coming to the studio were all hilarious, and played with the sort of confidence I don't know that she would have had at the start of the series.\\" The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin said that the Jenna and Tracy subplot was not the most inspired idea, but admitted it introduced one of his \\"favorite gags in 30 Rock history\\" regarding two make-up artists giving Tracy a monster claw to use as a white hand when they ran out of white powder. Rabin called it a \\"brilliant gag.\\" He was less enthusiastic with Winfrey in the episode, noting that her appearance \\"was treated as such a seismic cultural event that tonight's episode couldn't help but feel like a letdown.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that \\"the least effective plot\\" in this episode was Jenna and Tracy's.

Ramakrishna Pillai (1878‚Äì1916) was a nationalist writer, journalist, editor, and political activist. He edited Swadeshabhimani (The Patriot), the newspaper which became a potent weapon against the rule of the British and the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (Kerala, India) and a tool for social transformation. His criticism of the Diwan of Travancore, P. Rajagopalachari and the Maharajah led to the eventual confiscation of the newspaper. Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and exiled from Travancore in 1910. Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam (1912) and Karl Marx (1912) are among his most noted works in Malayalam, Vrithantha Pathra pravarthanam being the first book on journalism in Malayalam and Karl Marx, the first ever biography of Karl Marx in any Indian language. But it has been alleged that he plagiarized the biography from an essay, Karl Marx:A Modern Rishi, by Lala Hardayal, published in 1912 March issue of the Modern Review, published from Kolkata (Ramachandran, Grandalokam, January,2018). Early life K.Ramakrishna Pillai was born in Athiyanoor (Arangamugal in Neyyattinkara Taluk of Travancore) on 25 May 1878 (ME :1053 Edavam 16). He was the youngest son of Chakkiamma and Narasimhan Potti, a temple-priest. The patriarch of the family (Thekkekod veedu) had once saved the life of Prince Marthanda Varma from his enemies. When Marthanda Varma became king or Maharaja of Travancore, he gifted the family of land, a 12-room mansion and certain privileges in the Krishna temple in Neyyattinkara. Ramakrishna Pillai was born over a century later. Following the matrilineal Nair tradition, Ramakrishna Pillai spent much of his boyhood with his maternal uncle, Advocate Keshava Pillai. He had his early education at Neyyattinkara English Medium School and Rajagiyamahapadashala, the Royal school, Thiruvananthapuram. He was a shy and silent student. Kattupana Naganathaiyer, K. VeluPilla and R. Keshavapilla were his early teachers. Ramakrishna Pillai utilized his less restricted life in Thiruvananthapuram to acquaint himself with new books, newspapers, new places and new friends. He passed his matriculation exam at the age of 14. Journalism While studying for F.A, Ramakrishna started taking a keen interest in newspapers and journalism. An avid reader, he read almost every newspaper published from Travancore, Malabar and Kochi States. During the time, he also gained the friendship and guidance of many literary legends and editors like Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran, Adithya Das ,A R Rajaraja Varma, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, Pettayil Raman Pillai Asshan, Oduvil Kunji Krishna Menon and Kandathil Varghese Mappillai. This inspired him to write articles for news papers. His excessive passion for writing and newspapers, earned the wrath of his uncle and family. He passed in the F.A. exam in 1898 and wanted to go to Madras for his BSc degree. However, on the directives of his uncle, he joined for BA degree course at University College, Trivandrum. Ramakrishna Pillai and other newspaper-enthusiasts had felt the need of a Malayalam newspaper. Kerala Darpanum and Vanjivibhujhika were already being published since 1900. Though his friends and well wishers persuaded him to take up the editorship of Kerala Darpanum, it was difficult to manage studies and the editorship of a newspaper. Due to the resistance of his uncle Keshava Pillai, Ramakrishna had to leave home to take up a job. He passed the B.A. (Malayalam ) Degree with first rank and received the Keralvarmamudhra, an honorary award for academic excellence. Ramakrishna Pillai began writing strongly against age-old malpractices and ill-customs of those days. he believed in action than words. He challenged customary practices by marrying Nanikutti Amma , Thoopuveetil, Palkulangara, Thiruvananthapuram, a woman from lower sub-caste of the Nair community in 1901. A relative of Nanikutti Amma, Shri Prameshvaran Pillai, was the owner of Kerala Darappanum. Later, however, Ramakrishna Pillai and Prameshvaran Pillai got into litigation. In 1901, Kerala Darappanum and Vanjivibhujhika merged to form Keralapanjhika. Keralapanjhika was owned by Marthanada Thampi. Ramakrishna Pillai was editor of the newspaper from 1901 to 1903. During this time, he traveled around the state of Travancore to gather first hand account of the people of Travancore and their problems. In February 1903, he resigned from Keralapangika. He, however, continued to write articles in Nasranideepika and Malayali newspapers. In 1904 he moved to Kollam with his family to work as the editor of Malayali. He wrote editorials on the rights and duties of the people of Travancore. He also spoke at conferences held in Cherthala and Paravur Taluks about the ills and malpractices rampant in the society. In 1904, his wife Nanikutti Amma died. During the period, literary discourses and letters brought Ramakrishna Pillai close to B. Kalyani Amma. Later they were married. Swadeshabhimani Abdul Khader Moulavi, popularly known as Vakkom Moulavi, was the owner of the journal called Swadeshabhimani and C P Govinda Pillai, the editor. RamaKrishna Pillai took over as the editor of the journal in January 1906. Ramakrishna Pillai and his family thus shifted to Vakkom in Chirayinkil Taluk, where the office of the newspaper and the printing press were located. In July 1907, the office of Swadeshabhimani was moved to Thiruvananthapuram and the family moved to Thiruvananthapuram. Though Vakkom Moulavi continued to own the paper, he had given Ramakrishna Pillai total freedom to run the newspaper. They never had any legal or financial contracts between them. Yet, Moulavi provided all the financial aid to set up the press in Thiruvananthapuram. Ramakrisha Pillai also started a woman's magazine called Sharadha, a student's magazine called Vidhyarthi and another magazine named Keralan. P. Rajagopalachari, the then Diwan of Travancore, was the centre of attacks of the newspaper. The paper accused the Dewan of immorality and corruption. But \\"the most serious thing against the Swadeshabhimani,\\" wrote the Dewan, \\"has always been the remarkable persistence with which it preached the gospel of government by the people, and the exhortation which it held out to the people of Travancore to unite and demand self-government.\\". He also attacked the kingship of the Maharaja of Travancore: > \\" The monarchs believe and force others to believe that they are God's > representatives or incarnations. This is absurd. Did God create a special > kind of dog to be the king of dogs, or a special kind of elephant to rule > over all elephants? \\" Swadeshabhimani's pen moved against corruption in the state and injustice in the society. He irritated the Maharajah Moolam Thirunal himself by criticizing the large expenses incurred by the Royal consort, the Panapillai Amma, by constructing private palaces and publicly celebrating the wedding of the daughter of the Maharajah. On 26 September 1910, Swadeshabhimani newspaper and the printing press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police. Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to Thirunelveli in Madras Province of British India. The superintendent of police, F S S George (a British officer), Inspector R Achuthen Pillai, Inspector B Govinda Pillai and Inspector Pichu Aiyangar, carried out the arrest, without an arrest warrant. The police escorted him till Thirunelveli. The Kingdom of Travancore itself was a princely state under the Madras Presidency, then. Ramakrishna Pillai's family joined him later once he moved to a rented house in Madras. Editorships of newspapers like Kochi and Malabar came to be offered to him during the time, but he chose to stay in Madras. Many nationalists and Indian newspapers reacted to the arrest and banishment of Ramakrishna Pillai and the banning of the paper. However, countering the king and the British Government that overruled the king, was not easy. Yet, early in the first half of the twenties, the banned newspaper was revived by the mighty will of K. Kumar of Travancore, the veteran Gandhian and Freedom Fighter. He viewed the revival as a befitting tribute to Ramakrishna Pillai. Kumar himself was its manager and chief-editor. He was assisted in his efforts by K. Narayana Kurukkal, a close colleague of Ramakrishna Pillai and the author of the novels: \\"Parappuram\\" and \\"Udayabhanu\\" besides Barrister A K Pillai. Ramakrishna Pillai's wife, B. Kalyani Amma, Pillai's associates K. Narayana Kurukkal, R. Narayana Panikker and the famous political-journalist Raman Menon and K. Kumar himself were regular contributors to the magazine. The paper was revived under the same name 'Swadeshabhimani' and had its headquarters in the building currently housing the DPI Office at Thycaud, Thiruvananthapuram. In spite of all these, the government wisely chose to remain silent. The new 'Swadeshabhimani' was re-modeled after \\"Modern Review\\" of Ramand Chatterjee. It continued its legacy as a significant force transforming the socio-political life of Kerala. K. Kumar had great admiration for Ramakrishna Pillai and he took the lead role in organizing the deportation-day of Pillai as \\"Ramakrishna Pillai Day\\" (from M.E: 10-02-1098) and erecting his statue in Trivandrum. Ramakrishna Pillai Day continued to be commemorated in Trivandrum for a long time thereafter.The Audacious Nationalist (K.C. Pillai)- K. Kumarji Smaraka Grantham - 1974 It appears that the editorship of Swadeshabhimani passed on to A.K Pillai (by 1932) who also edited the \\"Swarat\\" with the help and support of K. Kumar. NOTE: After Independence, the Government of Kerala returned the press of Swadeshabhimani to Vakkom Moulavi's family in 1957. Ramakrishna Pillai Samadhi at Kannur Last years While in exile, Ramakrishna Pillai returned to his studies. He joined the F.L. Degree and Kalyaniamma joined BA Degree program in Philosophy. It was during these days in Madras that he wrote the book Ende Naadukadathal ( ) on his banishment from Travancore. After a brief vacation in Palghat, the family returned to Madras. Pillai had to attend to studies as well as court proceedings in the Indian Patriot Case. In April, the couple left Madras. Their third child, a daughter, was born following this on 7 August 1912. In the same year, Ramakrishna Pillai published Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam, a book on Journalism which became very popular later. His biographies of Karl Marx and Benjamin Franklin were also published. There are scores of articles and literary creations to his credit. In May 1913, the family went to Palghat after which Ramakrishna Pillai published his books Mannante Kannathum and Narakathil Ninnu. When Kaliyaniamma found a job as a teacher in Kannur, they moved Kannur. His physical health began to deteriorate during this period.Ramakrishna Pillai A prolific writer and fearless campaigner of civil rights, Swadeshabhimani K Ramakrishna Pillai succumbed to his ille-health on 28 March 1916. He will be remembered as the bitterest enemy of the scheduled castes and tribes in Kerala. When the Travancore government opened the government schools for the dalits in 1910, Pillai wrote three editorials criticizing it, saying the higher castes are intellectually superior, echoing the racist sentiments of Adolf Hitler (Swadeshabhimani:Klavu Pidicha Kapatyam by Ramachandran, published by NBS).

Forensic photo of the bodies of the Pallottine Fathers. The San Patricio Church massacre was the murder of three priests and two seminarians of the Pallottine order on July 4, 1976, during the Dirty War, at St. Patrick's Church, located in the Belgrano neighborhood in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The victims were priests Alfredo Leaden, Alfredo Kelly, and Pedro Duffau and seminarians Salvador Barbeito and Emilio Barletti. The murders were ordered by an Argentine Navy admiral.  The crime  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on , three youths, Luis Pinasco, Guillermo Silva, and Julio V√≠ctor Mart√≠nez, watched as two cars parked in front of the church of San Patricio. As the son of a soldier, Mart√≠nez thought it might be part of an assassination attempt on his father, so he went to Police Station No. 37 to make a complaint. Minutes later, a police car arrived on the scene and officer Miguel √Ångel Romano spoke with people who were suspects in the case. At 2:00 in the morning Silva and Pinasco saw a group of people with rifles get out of the cars and enter the church. The next morning, at the time of the first Mass, a group of worshippers waiting in front of the church found the door closed. Surprised by the situation, the young Fernando Savino, organist of the parish decided to enter through a window and found on the first floor the bodies of the five religious riddled with bullets, and lined up face down in a huge puddle of blood on a red carpet. The murderers had written with chalk on a door: They also wrote on a carpet: The initials \\"M.S.T.M.\\" stand for (the Movement of Priests for the Third World), while the first sentence about \\"Federal Security\\" refers to the bomb attack the Montoneros (whose motto was \\"Venceremos\\") had set off two days before in the dining room of the Argentine Federal Police headquarters, killing 20 people.

It is based on the 1987 novel Rich in Love by Josephine Humphreys. Plot The Odom family lives in a large, white, Southern house in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, just off Pitt Street, looking out onto Charleston Harbor. Lucille Odom (Erbe) is nearing the end of her last year of high school when her mother, Helen Odom (Clayburgh), leaves the family, breaking all ties. Lucille is left to care for her recently retired father, Warren Odom (Finney). The family spends the summer trying to get their lives together, which is complicated when the older daughter of the family, Rae (Amis), moves back home with a new husband (MacLachlan) and a baby on the way, about which Rae has mixed feelings. While reminiscing about their mother, Rae tells Lucille that their mother tried to abort Lucille when she was pregnant. Warren notices his daughters in new and different ways now that his wife is gone and he is no longer working. Everything changes for Lucille as she comes- of-age and learns about her family in new ways.

These verbs are also the only verbs in Icelandic which inflect with the mixed conjugation (is) except for the preterite-present verbs. Overview The verbs are gr√≥a (\\"to heal, to grow\\"), n√∫a (\\"to rub, to wipe\\"), r√≥a (\\"to row\\") and sn√∫a (\\"to turn\\"). The principal parts of the ri-verbs are as following: {  !First principal part !Second principal part !Third principal part - !Infinitive !First person singular past tense indicative mood !Past participle - A√∞ sn√∫a (\\"to turn\\")√âg sneri or sn√©ri (\\"I turned\\")√âg hef sn√∫i√∞ (\\"I have turned\\") - A√∞ gr√≥a (\\"to heal\\")√âg greri or gr√©ri (\\"I healed\\")√âg hef gr√≥i√∞ (\\"I have healed\\") - A√∞ n√∫a (\\"to rub\\")√âg neri or n√©ri (\\"I rubbed\\")√âg hef n√∫i√∞ (\\"I have rubbed\\") - A√∞ r√≥a (\\"to row\\")√âg reri or r√©ri (\\"I rowed\\")√âg hef r√≥i√∞ (\\"I have rowed\\") } Origin Historically, r√≥a and sn√∫a belonged to the seventh class of \\"strong\\" (irregular) verbs, which was the only class of verbs in Germanic that had retained the reduplication inherited from the Proto-Indo-European perfect aspect. In Old Norse, the verb s√° (\\"to sow\\") also belonged to this group, but it has become regular in Modern Icelandic. The past tense of these three verbs from Proto-Germanic and Proto-North-Germanic was as follows: * *r≈çanƒÖ (\\"to row\\") - *rer≈ç (\\"I rowed\\") * *sn≈çanƒÖ (\\"to turn\\") - *sesn≈ç > *sezn≈ç (\\"I turned\\") * *sƒìanƒÖ (\\"to sow\\") - *ses≈ç > *sez≈ç (\\"I sowed\\") Originally, all conjugation class 7 verbs showed this reduplication. In most verbs containing -ƒì- in the stem, this changed to -≈ç- through a process known as ablaut, which was common to all strong verbs. The change from s- to z- was due to Verner's law, a historical sound change in the Proto-Germanic language whereby voiceless fricatives were voiced when immediately following an unstressed syllable in the same word. Given that reduplicating prefix was originally unaccented, this caused voicing of /s/ to /z/. In Old Norse, this -z- was rhotacized to -r-, creating the following forms: * r√≥a (\\"to row\\") - r√∏ra, rera (\\"I rowed\\") * sn√∫a (\\"to turn\\") - sn√∏ra, snera (\\"I turned\\") * s√° (\\"to sow\\" < *s√°a) - s√∏ra, sera (\\"I sowed\\") The forms with √∏ were older and resulted from a vowel rounding process (u-umlaut) caused by word-final -≈ç, which became -u in Old Norse before it was deleted altogether. Following this, the verbs adopted the endings of irregular verbs in the past tense, with -a, -ir, -i in the first, second and third person singular past, and later the original vowel e was restored. The verbs gr√≥a and gn√∫a (n√∫a in modern Icelandic) were adapted to the forms of r√≥a and sn√∫a by analogy, although they did not begin with s- or r- (their past tenses in Germanic were *gegr≈ç and presumably *gegn≈ç). In modern Icelandic, the first person singular ending was replaced by -i in all weak verbs, and the ri-verbs followed suit. The verb s√° then eventually became weak, reducing the number of ri-verbs to the current four.

Founded in 1979 by Michael Rainville, the business is known for crafting American-made wooden toys, games, and gifts. Notable product lines include the NameTrains Wooden Railway System, Montgomery Schoolhouse, and Schoolhouse Naturals. History  1970s  Mike Rainville first came to woodworking as a hobby when he was 11. At that time, his mother, Pat, told him that, ‚Äúhe needed to find something to do.‚Äù Rainville‚Äôs grandparents had a history of working with their hands, specifically woodworking and farming, so there were always materials around to utilize. Rainville made his first items, spools and bobbin holders, in his parents‚Äô basement in Lincoln, Vermont, using some spare wood, a coping saw, and a sanding block. As time progressed, he started making cribbage boards which are still being made today. Local craft fairs provided him with income to purchase new equipment and materials. By 1979, Rainville had established his first wholesale relationship.  1980s  Rainville continued making product as he worked his way through Clarkson University, frequently returning to Lincoln on weekends. After graduating in 1984, he set about constructing a new woodshop of sufficient size for his now-full-time business. The name ‚ÄúMaple Landmark Woodcraft‚Äù was also adopted. This name was an extension of Maple Landmark Homestead, the family maple sugaring business and dairy farm. In 1987, Maple Landmark acquired Troll‚Äôs Toy Workshop of Barnet, Vermont. This addition brought in many alphabet-themed products, including letter cars, blocks, and signage letters. The company quickly grew to warrant more full- time employees.  1990s  NameTrains logo The product line evolved over the following decade, adding items such as trivets, ornaments, and the first NameTrains, a derivative line of the Troll‚Äôs Toy Workshop line alphabet letter car line. Originally finished with a clear coat, the NameTrains rapidly increased in popularity. As more retailers expressed interest in having colored letters, a non-toxic color dye stain was developed and the first colored NameTrains appeared on the market in 1994. Production of these new products made space tight in the Lincoln facility by late 1994. With no room to expand, the decision was made to build a new shop in Middlebury, Vermont that would have easier access to raw materials and a retail space for visitors to shop for products year-round. Maple Landmark moved into the new shop on Exchange Street in Middlebury in 1996. The original woodshop still exists in Lincoln, though mostly used for storage, and is usually referred to as ‚Äúthe Old Shop.‚Äù With the need to keep up with product demand, both in quantity and quality, investments were made in lasers and additional CNC routers. These machines allowed for more production in less labor-intensive manners. The lasers also gave Maple Landmark the ability to add graphic designs to products, creating the option to do custom work alongside regular production work. More products and more machines required the enlargement of the Middlebury factory to in 1999.  2000s  In 2001, Maple Landmark purchased Montgomery Schoolhouse of Montgomery, Vermont, another long-established Vermont-based wooden toy producer. The acquisition was inspired by Rainville‚Äôs desire to not see the Montgomery Schoolhouse name, products, and history lost and forgotten. All operations were consolidated in Middlebury and, moving forward, products were redesigned to be more efficiently produced. Through the changes, the names and integrity of the products lines were maintained. The economic downturn in the early-2000s impacted business as toys, games, and gifts were often bought with discretionary income. Low growth continued until the summer of 2007 when products from other countries and manufacturers were being recalled for child health and safety reasons. These recalls boosted Maple Landmark's business in late 2007 and 2008 with consumers looking for products and companies that they could trust. Simultaneously, Maple Landmark Woodcraft developed the Schoolhouse Naturals line of products, featuring simple engraved wooden toys without any finishes. This product line was popular among consumers that were particularly concerned about chemicals. In January 2009, Maple Landmark created a wooden souvenir train for the United States presidential inauguration following the election of Barack Obama in 2008.  2010s  In an effort to stay flexible and innovative, Maple Landmark purchased several printers that allow for full color printing on wood. These additions allowed for more colorful and intricate designs, both in standard and custom product. In January 2013, Maple Landmark created a wooden souvenir limousine for the United States presidential inauguration following the reelection of Barack Obama in 2012. In 2014, Adam Rainville, Mike's older son, returned to the business after studying at Clarkson University. In 2016, a addition was completed on the Middlebury factory, bringing the total to . The three-year project allowed for more production and packing and shipping space. The Vermont Small Business Administration named Mike Rainville the Vermont Small Business Person of the Year for 2017. Also in 2017, Andrew Rainville, Mike's younger son, returned to the business after studying at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Products Maple Landmark crafts a wide variety of wooden products from toys, to games, to gifts. Some product lines include NameTrains, Wooden Railway System, Hang-A-Name, Montgomery Schoolhouse, Schoolhouse Naturals, Solace, and Peterson Birds.  Affiliations  Maple Landmark is affiliated with many industry and regional organizations such as the Vermont Wood Manufacturer's Association, Wood Products Manufacturing Association, American Specialty Toy Retailing Association (ASTRA), Vermont Chamber of Commerce, Vermont Attractions Association, and Addison County Chamber of Commerce.

The series premiered on September 22, 2004, during UPN's last two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN's successor, The CW Television Network. Set in the fictional town of Neptune, the series starred Kristen Bell as the title character, a student who progressed from high school to college during the series while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Neptune Neptune, California, is the series' fictional setting, a US unincorporated town in Balboa County. The town is described as without a middle class, and the upper class is known as \\"09ers\\", wealthy citizens from the fictional 90909 ZIP code. The nearby towns, at some distance from the beaches, do not have the same extremes between rich and poor. Geography Neptune is a coastal community located between San Diego and Los Angeles on the route of California's Pacific Coast Highway. Many locations in California are named after Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, including the Balboa Peninsula section of Newport Beach in Orange County and San Diego's Balboa Park. In reality, State Route 1 does not run south of Orange County. In season 1, it is implied that Neptune is about 85 miles (or a 90-minute drive) from San Diego. Series creator Rob Thomas stated in an interview that Neptune is located near San Juan Capistrano in Orange County. Neptune scenes are generally filmed in San Diego County, and exteriors of all of the show's most notable locations are found there. For example, exteriors of the Mars residence are filmed in Point Loma, and exteriors of Mars Investigations are filmed on Adams Avenue in Normal Heights. Oceanside High School in Oceanside, California, doubles as the fictional Neptune High, and San Diego State University, University of California, San Diego and University of San Diego are portrayed as the fictional Hearst College. Qualcomm Stadium represents Shark Field, a fictitious stadium in Balboa County that is demolished in the second season. The (numerically) closest real zip codes to 90909 are 90899, which belongs to Long Beach, California, 91001 which belongs to Altadena, California, and 92009 which belongs to Carlsbad, California. 909xx series zip codes are an unassigned series in the greater Los Angeles zipspace.United States Postal Service. L002 3-Digit ZIP Code Prefix Matrix (Domestic Mail Manual online), viewed 2008-07-20. Politics All aspects of Neptune, including its politics, are controlled by the \\"09ers\\". Neptune is the county seat of Balboa, containing the county's main Sheriff's Office (the only one seen) and the County Supervisor's Office. When the series begins, the sheriff is Don Lamb. Lamb is more concerned with the bureaucratic side of his job rather than proper and thorough police work. He gained his office in an emergency recall election, after the ousting of his former boss Keith Mars. Lamb has consistently displayed significant favoritism toward 09'ers, such as allowing Jake Kane to avoid having his daughter Lilly's car impounded for unpaid parking tickets. A County Supervisor, informally referred to as the \\"Mayor\\" of Neptune, was seen during the season one episode \\"Silence of the Lamb,\\" but his name was not given. At the start of season two, baseball team owner Woody Goodman ran for and won the position of County Supervisor, holding the position until fleeing Neptune after being accused of blowing up the school bus at the start of the season. Besides being eventually exposed as a pedophile child molester, Goodman was murdered by Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas, the son of a wealthy \\"09er\\" family who had been sexually abused by Goodman when he was younger. As of the third season, no word has been given as to how Goodman's death would be handled in terms of naming a successor to the position of \\"County Supervisor\\". The second season explored these political elements with plotlines involving an election for the offices of Sheriff and County Supervisor, with Keith Mars (supported by Goodman) trying to get his old job as sheriff back by running against Don Lamb. While Keith lost his bid to reclaim his old job, Goodman won his election. Afterwards, he showed his ambitious side by launching a campaign to incorporate Neptune, which would lead to the town having an official mayor and its own police department, with the municipal boundaries only including the \\"09er\\" sections of town. Those outside this incorporation area came under risk of lower property values and even further reduction in government response and effectiveness. The incorporation would also have gutted the powerbase of Sheriff Lamb, as the local Sheriff's office is located outside the \\"09er\\" section of the town, effectively leaving Lamb on the outside looking in. This led to much speculation as to why Goodman aligned himself politically with Keith Mars, a plot point that was not explored during the season. In the end, Goodman's incorporation scheme failed due to a blackmail scheme orchestrated by his former child molestation victim Cassidy Casablancas. With help from his stepmother Kendall Casablancas, Cassidy had purchased a great deal of property outside the incorporation zone at bargain-basement prices (due to the depressed property values brought about due to incorporation talks) and sought to make a profit on them by killing incorporation, driving their prices back up to their original values. Threatening to go public regarding the child molestation charges, Cassidy forced Goodman to manufacture a sex scandal which implicated Keith Mars. Cassidy knew that Keith would fight Goodman to clear his name, and would ensure as a result that the public would think of Goodman as an adulterous politician. This 'backfiring' scandal would then cause Neptune residents to vote against Goodman and incorporation. Following the plan, incorporation lost at the ballot box‚Äîthough Cassidy would not live to reap the rewards of his scheme for himself, as he committed suicide after Veronica revealed that Cassidy had murdered several of his classmates (along with several innocent bystanders) in order to keep said classmates from exposing Goodman as a pedophile child molester before Cassidy's blackmail/real estate scheme could be carried out. Economy Neptune has a huge gap between the rich \\"09ers\\" and those who work for them either directly or through service industry businesses. In Veronica's words, if you are young and live in Neptune, \\"either your parents are millionaires, or your parents work for millionaires\\". In the pilot episode and other season one episodes, it was implied that the Mars family existed on the fringes of the \\"09er\\" society and that most of their social standing came from Keith Mars's job as sheriff and Veronica's friendship with the children of software mogul Jake Kane. The largest and most successful business in the community, Kane Software is run and operated by Jake Kane, father of Duncan Kane and Lilly Kane. The company holds the patent on streaming video over the Internet, and according to Veronica is responsible for the huge boom in the local economy. When the patent was approved, many people in the community became rich overnight. Other \\"09ers\\" (such as movie star Aaron Echolls and his family) choose to live in Neptune due to its warm climate and its beaches, thus contributing even more to its economy. A few residents have become rich through service businesses (such as the Casablancas family, through real estate) in the boom created by the other \\"09ers\\". The Mars Residence The Mars' apartment building, as shown in the pilot episode, is The Inn at Sunset Cliffs on Point Loma, 1370 Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, in San Diego. This area of Point Loma has a reputation as a beautiful place to watch the sunset and waves crashing below, as well as being a favorite surfing spot.Figuracion, Inigo. \\"Veronica Mars San Diego Locations\\". About.com Guide. Retrieved on March 18, 2010. Mars Investigations The exterior shot of the building where Veronica's dad's private investigation agency is housed is the Cabrillo Academy of the Sword along 3339 Adams Avenue 92116 in Normal Heights. For reference, the popular Lestat's Coffee House is next to where Mars Investigations would be. Most of the scenes filmed inside the office of Mars Investigations are, of course, on a set at the Stu Segall lot. Across the street and on the same block as Mars Investigations is the car wash often seen in Season One flashbacks with Lilly Kane. It is the Adams Avenue Car Wash on Adams Avenue. Neptune High Neptune High is a high-school in the fictional seaside city of Neptune, California, attended by Veronica in the first two seasons. The school is divided into two groups, the \\"09ers\\" in one group, and everyone else in the other, including the PCH Bike Club. Neptune's main rival is Pan High, who are known to perform pranks on each other every year. The former principal, Alan Moorehead, was exposed to have had an affair with one of his students and have hid the baby that resulted from the affair in the girls' bathroom (\\"My Mother, the Fiend\\"). Moorehead was subsequently replaced by Principal Van Clemmons Mr. Rooks was also found to have had an affair with one of his students, Susan Knight (\\"Mars vs. Mars\\"). Ms. Hauser, the health teacher, was caught taking money from the Senior Trip (\\"Ain‚Äôt No Magic Mountain High Enough\\"). Neptune High also had a policy of \\"Pirate Points\\", where students who were involved in certain activities, like sports, student council, and cheerleading, were allowed extra privileges (like getting to have food delivered on-campus). Duncan Kane, upon becoming student council president, restructured the Pirates Points system to allow those in band, the school newspaper, school plays, on the honor roll, or those in vocational trades receive points as well (\\"Return of the Kane\\"). Neptune High was also home to a secret society called the Tritons. Those who were chosen to become Tritons had to go through various hazing rituals, such as streaking through the school, performing karaoke, or speaking entirely in pangrams (\\"Clash of the Tritons\\"). During the filming of the pilot, producer Paul Kurta said that much of the filming would take place in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was \\"a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven.\\" The setting of Neptune High, which was featured in the first two seasons, was also located in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. Neptune Grand The exterior of the Hilton San Diego with \\"Neptune Grand\\" signs. The San Diego convention center can be seen in the distance. The Neptune Grand is a luxury hotel, mainly catering to the upper class, as opposed to the cheaper Camelot Motel. Lianne Mars told Veronica that Jake Kane was innocent of his daughter's murder because he had been at the Neptune Grand with Lianne at the time of Lilly's death. During the second season, Duncan lived in a suite in the Grand (\\"Driver Ed\\"). After a fire in Logan Echolls' house, he moved in with Duncan (\\"Rat Saw God\\") and he kept the suite after Duncan ran away to Australia. Logan held the \\"alterna-prom\\" in his suite when Neptune High canceled the prom (\\"Look Who‚Äôs Stalking\\") and also held a graduation party there. Veronica and Beaver's confrontation on the roof of the hotel ended with Beaver jumping to his death (\\"Not Pictured\\"). The Neptune Grand is where Aaron Echolls (Logan Echolls' father) was murdered, and the location where Dean O'Dell's wife Mindy had been having an affair with Hank Landry, Veronica's criminology professor. Exterior shots of the Hilton San Diego, Gaslamp Quarter were used for the Neptune Grand in season two. Other shots of the Hyatt Regency were also used. Hearst College Hearst College is a fictional Southern California college, attended by Veronica in the third season. The name was chosen in the series' second season when a prominent Californian name was needed, and there was already a Stanford University. Hearst is named after William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper magnate and leading newspaper publisher. Randolph Hearst's granddaughter Patty Hearst, was signed to play Selma Hearst Rose, the granddaughter of the founder of Hearst College. The character was an heiress of Hearst Mart, a chain similar to Wal-Mart. The setting of Hearst College was mostly filmed on the campuses of San Diego State University, University of San Diego, and the University of California, San Diego. Assistant Location Manager Steven Lee said that the filming locations were chosen by the director and by production designer Alfred Sole. Sole reportedly \\"really liked the look and feel of the school\\", and San Diego State University invited the series with \\"open arms\\". Taping at the university led to financial and employment benefits for the university and its students. Alumni worked as crewmembers while students worked as actors; half of the third season extras were students from the university's film department. Hearst College is first mentioned in the second season, when one of Veronica's fellow jurors recommends its generous scholarships and grant programs. (\\"One Angry Veronica\\") Later on in the season, Veronica and Wallace go to a \\"Get to Know Hearst\\" weekend. During her visit, Veronica discovers that there is a serial date rapist who shaves the heads of his victims. She manages to exonerate her ex-boyfriend Troy, but is not able to figure out who the rapist is. (\\"The Rapes of Graff\\") The third season begins with Veronica, Logan, Wallace, Mac, Dick, Piz and Parker as freshmen at Hearst College. Veronica is studying criminology, and is still living at home. Weevil is the maintenance worker at Hearst, and he forms a friendship with Dean Cyrus O'Dell. At the beginning of the semester, Parker is raped by the Hearst serial rapist. (\\"Welcome Wagon\\") Feeling guilty for not helping her, Veronica sets herself to catching the rapist. (\\"My Big Fat Greek Rush Week\\") Veronica discovers the identity of the rapist, a fellow student, and Dean O'Dell is found dead. (\\"Spit & Eggs\\") Hearst College is also mentioned in the TV Series Moonlight, also starring Jason Dohring, the actor who portrayed Logan Echolls. Hearst College is mentioned again in Rob Thomas' show \\"iZombie\\"; season 2 episode 5 titled \\"Love & Basketball\\", when one of the murder suspects bet on a basketball game from Hearst College, where he went to school. Cuba In the episode \\"A Trip to the Dentist\\" what is supposed to be a location in Cuba (the country) is actually the El Prado area of Balboa Park, where most of the museums are concentrated. Strip clubs In a couple of early episodes, strip clubs are seen in stakeouts: the Body Shop and Les Girls, both located next to each other just off Rosecrans Blvd. in the Sports Arena/Midway district. Dog Beach/Boardwalk Dog Beach in Ocean Beach appears to have been the location for most of the beach scenes in Veronica Mars. Some other beach scenes were also filmed at La Jolla Shores beach. Some of the Neptune Boardwalk scenes in the first two seasons were shot at Belmont Park in Mission Beach ‚Äî the Giant Dipper Rollercoaster is the giveaway. Other Sightings The video store in \\"Meet John Smith\\" is Kensington Video on Adams Ave. in Kensington. Scolari's Office in North Park is Fitzpatrick's Bar. Winston's bar in Ocean Beach was used in \\"Welcome Wagon\\". Gorey's Market Liquor & parking lot on 36th and University (92104) were used on two scenes in S3 E15 \\"Papa's Cabin\\". The gym in \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\" is Stern's Gym on Granada Ave in North Park. Other frequently used locales were Ocean Beach, Sunset Cliffs, La Jolla, Torrey Pines Golf Course, Oceanside and Normal Heights, as well as Mission Bay.

Gameplay Potential contestants purchased a $100,000 Fortune Hunt scratch- off ticket from an Illinois Lottery retailer. To play the $100,000 Fortune Hunt players had to rub off the play area on the lottery instant ticket. If three matching prize amounts were revealed, the player won the prize shown‚Äìsuch as a free ticket or up to $100. If three TV symbols appeared, players could submit the ticket to the lottery for a preliminary drawing. This drawing was held every week in Springfield. At this first stage each week, six on-air contestants and 12 at-home viewers were selected from the preliminary drawing of entry tickets and asked to participate in the $100,000 Fortune Hunt. Only the first six contestants would appear on the TV show and have the opportunity to win the grand prize or other prizes. Two of the 12 at-home viewers were assigned to each of the six on-air contestants as partners. While one of the six who appeared on the game show won the grand prize, his or her two home \\"partners\\" would win $500 each. Each of the remaining five on-air contestants would receive at least $1,000, and their partners would receive $100. During the TV show, the six contestants would face a game board with 36 numbered panels. Each panel would reveal a plus or minus dollar amount (scores could never go below zero); players would try to accumulate the most money by randomly selecting panels. There would be special panels such as bankrupt, lose a turn, wipeout, and double. The player who collects the highest prize amount after five rounds was declared the winner and received the $100,000 grand prize. The other contestants, one at a time, would then be given a choice to keep their total winnings or trade them for a choice of prizes (hidden behind 12 numbered panels). These ranged from cash amounts totaling between $1,000 and $10,000 to merchandise such as rooms of furniture, trips, a big screen television, a camcorder combo, and many others. These rules only lasted the first seven months the show was on the air. Afterwards, the losing contestants got to keep whatever money they earned in the game, with a minimum of $1,500 if they didn't have that much. At the end of each show, hostess Kollmeyer drew six tickets at random from a revolving drum. The players who purchased those tickets were selected as the contestants for the next show. Other spaces included: *Bankrupt ‚Äì The player who selected this lost his or her entire score; this space was signified by a dollar sign in a no symbol. *Double ‚Äì If the player uncovered a Double space, he or she immediately picked another number off the game board, winning double the amount revealed (if the player uncovered a minus dollar amount, they lost that amount of money and no more); this space was signified by a red star with the word DOUBLE written across it in capital letters. *Lose a Turn ‚Äì The player who selected this earned no money in that round; this space was signified by a sad face with the words \\"Lose a Turn\\" written at the bottom, which was later changed to the word TURN in a no symbol. *Free Turn ‚Äì The player who selected this earned a Free Turn token which he or she could redeem at any time for an additional selection from the board. *Decision ‚Äì The player who selected this could accept a prize (a brand new car in the first three rounds, and a luxury trip in the last two rounds) and resign from the game or pass on the prize and continue; this space was signified by a red star with a question mark over it (later in the run, this was changed to the word CAR or TRIP). Eventually, the trip was restricted to the consolation game, leaving the car the only prize offered in the main game. *1/2 Car ‚Äì This spaced replaced \\"Decision\\" later in the run. This space was signified by the front of the car in the first three rounds, and the back of the car in the last two rounds; players had to find both the front and back halves in order to choose to claim the car or pass it up and continue (just like with \\"Decision\\"). *Wipeout ‚Äì If the player selected it, they were eliminated from the game and left with only $1,000; the space was signified by a sad face. This space was removed after the first four episodes and was replaced with the \\"Lose a Turn\\" space as described above. At the end of the game, the player in the lead won the $100,000. During the final season, the winner returned the following Saturday for up to five weeks. If the game ended in a tie, another round was played with the tied players, with the bigger dollar amount winning the game and the jackpot. Bonus play On April 14, 1990, a new scratch-ticket was introduced with a new home-player rule. Each contestant would be designated with a letter from A-F from left to right. Later on, the contestants were also given letters from G-L, again from left to right. At the end of the show, home viewers would be given a chance to win $100 playing the at-home Bonus Play game. The winning contestant spun a wheel with 10 spaces numbered 0-9. The winning number would consist of the $100,000 winner's letter(s) followed by a 4-digit number which the studio contestant created with four spins of the Bonus Play wheel. Any home viewer whose Bonus Play ticket number matched the contestant's letter and the 4 digits in the order they were spun would win $100. All Bonus Play tickets were good to last forever, so home viewers could keep them for the next drawing whether they were winners or not. Sometime in the show's second season, the home player element was dropped from the show altogether. Notes After the show's cancellation in 1994, Kollmeyer carried over to the show's successor, Illinois Instant Riches, alongside Mark Goodman. The pair also hosted that program's revamp in 1998, Illinois' Luckiest.

History The song was written in November 2000, for an Asbury Park, New Jersey Christmas show benefit to help promote the revitalization of the city. Once a popular resort destination in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Asbury Park had succumbed to significant amounts of blight for a variety of reasons, including the ill-effects of the Great Depression, the opening of the Garden State Parkway, and race riots. The song first starts describing the current state of Asbury Park, the deterioration, and the absence of people in the area. Throughout the song, Springsteen continues to describe the city using images such as men loitering on a street corner and buildings with boarded-up windows: The song ends, however, on a hopeful and optimistic note by powerfully imploring the city to \\"rise up\\" from the decay: \\"My City of Ruins\\" was first played on December 17, 2000 at Asbury Park Convention Hall. September 11 association The song took on a new meaning soon after the September 11 attacks, offering a message of hope and rising from the ruins. The most famous live performance of the song came on September 21, 2001 during the America: A Tribute to Heroes national telethon. With only a guitar and a harmonica, Springsteen opened the program, introducing the number as \\"a prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters\\" and modifying a few phrases in the song. He was joined on stage by Patti Scialfa, Steven Van Zandt, Soozie Tyrell, Lisa Lowell and Clarence Clemons. It was included as the first track on the subsequent album released of the telethon performances. A studio recording of \\"My City of Ruins\\" was then incorporated as the concluding track of Springsteen's September 11-themed, July 2002 album release The Rising. Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake The song was widely used by New Zealand television stations during coverage of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and became an unofficial anthem of the city in the weeks and months that followed.https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/84161659/bruce- springsteen-coming-to-christchurch It inspired people of the city to rise up and rebuild the city, an endeavour which is now in progress. Springsteen played the song and dedicated it to the city during a concert in the city on the sixth anniversary of the earthquake, during his 2017 tour of Australia and New Zealand.https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/entertainment/watch-bruce- springsteen-dedicates-city-ruins-people-christchurch-during-quake-anniversary- eve-concert Subsequent live performance history \\"My City of Ruins\\" was included on the Live in Barcelona concert video and as a PBS special edition EP bonus track on Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin. After a tour of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, Springsteen played the song at the 2006 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. During the Working on a Dream Tour date in Rome, in July 2009, Springsteen dedicated this song to the victims of the earthquake which had devastated the Italian city of l'Aquila a few months before. The song was dedicated to the Jersey Shore on November 1, 2012 at Pennsylvania State University (a stop on the Wrecking Ball Tour) after Hurricane Sandy and was performed on December 12, 2012 at the Concert for Sandy Relief. Notable covers Eddie Vedder performed the song at the 32nd Annual Kennedy Center Honors as part of the multi-artist tribute to Bruce Springsteen, who was one of five recipients of the honor in 2009. In January 2010, pearljam.com announced that Eddie Vedder's cover of the song would be available on iTunes to raise funds for Haiti earthquake disaster relief efforts. The song entered the Hot 100 the following month, peaking at #92.

A. P. Clements during the Second Boer War. Background Lord Roberts captured Pretoria on 5 June and the armies soon passed to the east. After the guerrilla war began, a force under Clements harried the Boers in the Moot, a valley in the Magaliesberg mountains. By the end of the year, the British grew careless. On 2 December, De la Rey's commando ambushed an ox-wagon convoy east of Rustenburg, killing and wounding 64 British soldiers and capturing 54 men and 118 wagons. De la Rey's deputy, Jan Smuts had a close call when a bullet intended for him killed another Boer. The raiders appropriated the boots and clothing and burned the rest of the supplies, while setting their prisoners free.Pakenham, p 504 De la Rey scouted Clement's camp at Nooitgedacht for three days. The camp had good water supply and a nearby mountain allowed communication by heliograph with Major General Robert Broadwood at Rustenburg. However, the site was dominated on the north by a mountain. A 1500-man commando led by General Beyers soon arrived, giving the Boers numerical superiority over their adversaries. Smuts later wrote, \\"I do not think it was possible to have selected a more fatal spot for a camp.\\"Pakenham, p 505 Battle The Boer leaders soon agreed on a plan. Half of Beyers' men would stay behind to keep Broadwood from marching to the rescue. The remainder, about 1500 men, were split into three attacking groups. Beyers would lead his commando against 300 British pickets on the mountaintop. Beyers detached Commandant Badenhorst to attack the camp from the west. De la Rey would capture several kopjes in the Moot to the south. If all went well, Clements' brigade would be trapped and destroyed. In the event, Badenhorst's column blundered into the British picket lines in the pre-dawn darkness. In a brief fusillade at close range, the Boers were driven back, with losses on both sides. The alerted British now manned their defensive positions. Beyer then launched his attack on the mountaintop, but his tired men were soon stopped by sturdy resistance from the Northumberland Fusiliers. After witnessing De la Rey's initial attack being repulsed in the valley below, Beyer's men became inspired and stormed the British positions on the mountaintop.Evans, p 132 After losing about 100 casualties, Captain Yatman surrendered at about 7:00 am. Reinforcements climbing the mountain lost heavily when Beyers' men suddenly poured fire into them. That morning it was too hazy to flash a message to Broadwood, so Clements was entirely on his own. Meanwhile, De la Rey and Smuts had managed to capture all the kopjes in the Moot except one, Yeomanry Hill (Hartebeestfontein). Clements alertly and swiftly concentrated his survivors on this position. At 8:00 am, the British drove away a group of Boers who had gained a foothold on Yeomanry Hill. They then worked furiously to make the hill defensible. A 4.7-inch naval gun was even saved by rolling it downhill from its original perch and dragging it back to the main British position.Pakenham, p 506-507 Meanwhile, the men under Beyers turned aside to loot the British camp and nothing the Boer general could do would get them back to the battle. One Boer remarked, \\"We were refitted from head to heel.\\" At 4:00 pm, Clements and the remnant of his brigade rode off with his artillery toward Pretoria. Their retreat was virtually unopposed because the Boers were exhausted and by this time De la Rey's men had joined the other Boers in plundering the enemy camp.Pakenham, p 508 Aftermath Thanks to his quick response to the crisis, Clements saved his brigade from annihilation. However, the general lost half his brigade due to his poor choice for a camp. The Imperial forces suffered no consequences from their defeat aside from the casualties suffered and the supplies lost. Within a short time, a column under Clements was again harassing the Moot. Notes References * Evans, Martin Marix. The Boer War: South Africa 1899-1902. Oxford: Osprey, 1999. * Pakenham, Thomas.

The purity requirement varies with the application, for example a H2 ICE can tolerate low hydrogen purity where a hydrogen fuel cell requires high hydrogen purity to prevent catalyst poisoning.2007-DOE-Hydrogen Fuel Quality Hydrogen purity requirements for fuel cells In the first generation of fuel cells catalysts like palladium, ruthenium and platinum are used in combination with hydrogen production from hydrocarbons which results in performance degradation. The catalyst poisoning induced by some impurities like carbon monoxide, formic acid, or formaldehyde can be reversed with a high purity hydrogen stream. Presence of other impurities like sulfurs may lead to permanent degradation of the fuel cells. The kind of impurities and their level depends on the H2 production process (e.g., steam methane reforming, electrolysis) but impurities can also be introduced due to transport, cleaning of the refueling station, leakages or maintenance. In Europe, the Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure states that the hydrogen purity dispensed by hydrogen refuelling points shall comply with the technical specifications included in the ISO 14687-2 standard. ISO 14687-2 specifies maximum impurities levels for particles and several gaseous impurities. For many compounds the limit values are very low including total sulfur (4 nmol/mol) or carbon monoxide (200 nmol/mol). The least stringent limits are for helium (300 ¬µmol/mol) and total nitrogen/argon (300 ¬µmol/mol). The sum of the impurities should be less than 300 ¬µmol/mol (e.g. H2 purity is 99.97%).  Analytical methods for hydrogen purity analysis  As the limit values for many impurities are very low this sets stringent demands on the sensitivity of the analytical methods. Moreover, the high reactivity of some impurities requires use of a properly passivated sampling and analytical systems. A combination of different instruments (e.g. gas chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy) is now needed to cover all components listed in ISO 14687-2. Currently, several research efforts are directed to address the existing problems focusing on new multi-component analytical methods, risk assessments to limit the number of impurities to be analyzed (e.g. by using information from the H2 production process) and lay the metrological foundation for H2 purity analysis (,,).

The National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations (NCUSAR) is an American non-profit organization with the goal of improving Americans' knowledge and understanding of the Arab world. Background Founded in 1983, NCUSAR has public charity status in accordance with Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. All contributions are tax-deductible. The headquarters of the Council are located at 1730 M Street, Washington DC. Utilizing its politically central location and ties with sister organizations, the Council plays a role in convening regular meetings of the heads of a dozen Arab-U.S. relations organizations concerning the sharing of information, discussion of strategies, avoiding duplication of effort, and identifying and pursuing opportunities for greater inter-organizational cooperation. The Council is staffed by professionals and experts in the field of Arab politics. Most notable is President and CEO Dr. John Duke Anthony. Vice Presidents Patrick Macino and Dr. James Winship act as Director of Development and Program Manager respectively, while Megan Geissler heads the nationally recognized Model Arab League. These managers are backed by a team of interns who work seasonally. A fall spring internship opportunity is offered to college students, and a special fellowship exists for summer interns. The National Council is supported primarily by philanthropists, individuals, and institutions in the United States and the Arab world. Their involvement with the Council often begins with a single event or activity and grows into a broader relationship based on a shared commitment to the Council's vision and mission. The number of people involved with the Council has grown over the years. Vision The National Council's vision is a relationship between the United States and its Arab partners, friends, and allies that rests on a solid and enduring foundation. This concerns mutual political endeavors, economic ventures, and reciprocal appreciation for culture and heritage. Mission The National Council's mission is educational. It intends to improve American awareness and understanding of Arab countries, the Middle East, and the Islamic world. It does this by promoting programs for leadership development, educational lectures and publications, and public forums. NCUSAR hosts the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference, a gathering to discuss that year‚Äôs pressing issues in the Arab world. It also sponsors the intercollegiate Model Arab League, a student forum similar to the Model United Nations. Study abroad opportunities exist in the form of the Yemen College of Middle Eastern Studies and the Cairo League of Arab States Exchange. The National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations periodically sponsors public educational programs on Capitol Hill. There, an assemblage of specialists analyze, discuss, and debate issues of importance to the relationship between the U.S., Middle East, and Islamic World. Such events seek to strengthen trust and friendship while examining complex political issues. As a public service the Council serves as a nexus of information and contacts for grassroots, governmental, business, religious, and international institutions. In these ways the Council helps strengthen and expand the overall Arab-U.S. relationship. Publications In addition to the distribution of routine newsletters, the Council provides resources concerning Arab politics, history, and relation with the West. Video and audio recordings as well as transcripts of events hosted by the Council are made available to the public on a regular basis. Most notable of these are videos and transcripts of the forum discussions held at the annual Arab-U.S. Policymakers Conference. Also offered are free essays and articles published by Dr. John Duke Anthony, who has written in the past for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and the Gulf Co-operation Council. The NCUSAR also posts resources it deems useful in spreading knowledge about the Arab World. The Saudi-U.S. Relations Information Service (SUSRIS) project offers an objective and comprehensive view of the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship. SUSRIS‚Äôs main goal is to provide information from a variety of sources that would otherwise be difficult for most readers to uncover. Its free e-newsletter offers original materials such as interviews and essays. Since its launch in 2003, monthly website visits have measured in the millions. SUSRIS is routinely cited by major international media as a news source. A subscription to the e-newsletter is free and open to the public.

On 5 March 2011 it was announced that Furneaux would be stepping down from Grimsby's board of directors at the end of the 2010‚Äì2011 season amidst protests against himself and fellow directors Michael Chapman and John Elsom from supporters before the league tie with AFC Wimbledon. The fans had been unhappy with the trio who they had blamed for the resignation of vice-chairman Mike Parker earlier in the week. The news was broken to supporters when chairman John Fenty addressed them.http://www.thisisgrimsby.co.uk/grimsbytownnews/Peter-Furneaux-step- Grimsby-Town-board-directors/article-3298493-detail/article.html Furneaux stood down with immediate effect on 9 March 2011.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2311108,00.html Furneaux died on 2 December 2014, aged 79.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/news/article/r.i.p.-peter- furneaux-2120187.aspx#0qCvctjEi4q32zJJ.99 References Category:Grimsby Town F.C.

It is a member of the spotted fever group and the most geographically dispersed species in the group, recognized in most of the regions bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, Israel, Kenya, and other parts of North, Central, and South Africa, and India. The prevailing vector is the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The bacterium was isolated by Emile Brumpt in 1932 and named after A. Conor, who in collaboration with A. Bruch, provided the first description of boutonneuse fever in Tunisia in 1910. The genome of the bacterium has been sequenced and four subspecies have been identified.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Miami Marlins and Los Angeles Angels. Amateur career After he finished his high school career in Yokohama, Tazawa was not drafted by any of Nippon Professional Baseball's 12 teams, and joined the company team of Nippon Oil in the corporate league, unaffiliated with the NPB. In 2008, Tazawa posted a 10‚Äì1 record for Nippon Oil, with a 1.02 earned run average and 95 strikeouts in 88 innings. In the national corporate league championships, he posted two straight shutouts, the second one a complete game on four hits, 10 strikeouts and zero walks in a 4‚Äì0 quarterfinal win over Hitachi, Ltd. Tazawa appeared less than 24 hours later in a relief appearance in the semifinal against Central Japan Railway. He pitched 2 and 2/3 innings, and allowed three hits, struck out one, and gave up the go-ahead run in a 3‚Äì2 loss. Tazawa was the MVP of the championships, with a 4‚Äì0 record and 36 strikeouts. Professional career Tazawa with the Red Sox in 2011 In September 2008, Tazawa announced his intention to skip the NPB draft in order to pursue a career with a Major League team. During the 2008 season, his manager Hideaki Okubo encouraged him to attempt a career in Major League Baseball without first playing with a Nippon Professional Baseball team. Had Tazawa joined a Japanese professional team, he would have had to either wait nine years to become a free agent, or to hope that his team would auction the right to negotiate with him through the posting system. To avoid conflict between Japanese and U.S. teams, Tazawa asked NPB teams not to select him in the October 30 draft, and the 12 teams complied with the request. However, the teams passed a rule requiring any amateur player who signs overseas to sit out two to three years before he can join a Japanese team; high school players would have to sit two years, while college and corporate players three years. While Tazawa attracted the attention of American scouts, NPB announced that the major leagues of two nations had a gentlemen's agreement against signing Japanese amateurs, and general manager Brian Cashman, whose New York Yankees had a partnership agreement with Yomiuri Giants, said his team considered Tazawa hands off. However, Rob Manfred, MLB‚Äôs executive vice president for labor and human resources (and current MLB commissioner) denied that any gentleman's agreement was in place regarding the signing of Japanese amateur players. Boston Red Sox On December 4, 2008, Tazawa signed with the Boston Red Sox, reportedly for $3 million over three years. After his debut on August 7, 2009, he became the third Japanese player, after Mac Suzuki and Kazuhito Tadano, to play in Major League Baseball without first playing professionally in Japan. On March 22, 2009, Red Sox optioned Tazawa to its AA affiliate, Portland Sea Dogs. After achieving a record of 9‚Äì5 in 18 starts with a 2.57 ERA with Portland, Tazawa was promoted to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox on July 27, 2009. While in Portland, Tazawa was named to the 2009 Eastern League All Star team, was tied in second for total number of wins, and was tied for third in total strikeouts with 88. On August 7, 2009, Tazawa was activated from Pawtucket after the Red Sox designated John Smoltz for assignment. He made his debut that night against the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium in the 14th inning. Tazawa was the last pitcher left in the bullpen for the Red Sox. The first batter he faced was countryman Hideki Matsui, who lined out. In the bottom of the 15th, Tazawa surrendered a two-run walk off home run to Alex Rodriguez. Tazawa's first major league start was on August 11, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. In the first inning of the start Tazawa hit Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera in the hand while elevating on a fastball, to which Tigers starter Rick Porcello retaliated in trying to throw at Victor Martinez. In the next inning Cabrera was forced to leave the game due to his hand continuing to ail him. The first pitch thrown by Porcello in the bottom of the second inning hit Kevin Youkilis causing him to charge the mound, clearing both the benches and leading to the ejection of Youkilis and Porcello. Tazawa would go on to pitch five innings, winning the game while giving up one earned run and striking out six. With his start, Tazawa became the second youngest Japanese pitcher to start in a major league game. Tazawa's second start came against the Texas Rangers. He pitched five innings, giving up four runs on 10 hits and three walks and taking the loss. In his third start, against the New York Yankees, Tazawa pitched six scoreless innings, allowing eight hits, two walks and striking out two in the win. In April 2010, Tazawa underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow and was knocked out for the entire 2010 season. He began the 2011 season on the 60-day disabled list but eventually returned to pitch in three games for the Red Sox in 2011. Tazawa started 2012 in Triple-A Pawtucket before being called up to Boston on April 18 to replace the struggling Mark Melancon. Tazawa was optioned back to Triple-A on May 1. Tazawa was one of the rare bright spots in a dismal 2012 season, posting a 1.43 ERA in 44 innings. On April 26, 2012 against the Chicago White Sox, Tazawa tossed three scoreless innings for his first career save. In May 2013, Tazawa was named interim closer after injuries to Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey. By the end of July he had settled into the primary right-handed setup role ahead of new closer Koji Uehara. He continued in that role through Boston's run to the World Series championship, including pitching important innings in the ALCS and World Series. In 13 postseason appearances, Tazawa allowed only one run. He earned the win in the decisive Game 6 of the ALCS. On May 1, 2015, New York Yankees Slugger Alex Rodriguez hit a 3‚Äì0 93 mph fastball off Tazawa into the seats of Fenway in the eighth inning for his 660th career home run to tie Willie Mays for fourth place on the all time home runs list. Miami Marlins On December 16, 2016, Tazawa signed a two-year, $12 million dollar deal with the Miami Marlins.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/18288400/junichi-tazawa-miami- marlins-reach-agreement-two-year-contract Tazawa struggled in his first season, going 3-5 with a 5.69 ERA in 55 appearances. Tazawa was designated for assignment on May 17, 2018, and was released on May 21. He had a 9.00 ERA in 22 appearances at the time of his release. Detroit Tigers Tazawa with the Iowa Cubs in 2019 On June 4, 2018, Tazawa signed a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers. On July 9, he was released by the Toledo Mud Hens, the Triple-A affiliate of the Tigers. Los Angeles Angels On July 13, 2018, Tazawa was signed by the Los Angeles Angels on a minor-league contract. He will report to the Angels' spring training facility in Arizona. He was promoted to the major leagues on September 1, 2018. He became a free agent after the season ended. Chicago Cubs On January 26, 2019, Tazawa signed a minor-league deal with the Chicago Cubs. He was released on March 23, 2019. He re-signed with the Cubs on March 26. Tazawa was later released again on July 11, 2019. Cincinnati Reds On August 11, 2019, Tazawa signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds and was assigned to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts. He was released by the organization prior to the season on March 10, 2020. Saitama Musashi Heat Bears On July 20, 2020, Tazawa signed with the Saitama Musashi Heat Bears of the Baseball Challenge League. Pitching style Tazawa has three main pitches that include a 92-95 mph fastball (tops out at 97 mph), a curveball (73‚Äì77 mph), and a forkball/splitter (86‚Äì88 mph).

Common symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash. Typically these begin one to two weeks after exposure. The diseases are caused by specific types of bacterial infection. Epidemic typhus is due to Rickettsia prowazekii spread by body lice, scrub typhus is due to Orientia tsutsugamushi spread by chiggers, and murine typhus is due to Rickettsia typhi spread by fleas. Vaccines have been developed, but none are commercially available. Prevention is achieved by reducing exposure to the organisms that spread the disease. Treatment is with the antibiotic doxycycline. Epidemic typhus generally occurs in outbreaks when poor sanitary conditions and crowding are present. While once common, it is now rare. Scrub typhus occurs in Southeast Asia, Japan, and northern Australia. Murine typhus occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Typhus has been described since at least 1528 AD. The name comes from the Greek t√ªphos (œÑœçœÜŒøœÇ) meaning hazy, describing the state of mind of those infected. While \\"typhoid\\" means \\"typhus-like\\", typhus and typhoid fever are distinct diseases caused by different types of bacteria. Signs and symptoms These signs and symptoms refer to epidemic typhus, as it is the most important of the typhus group of diseases. Signs and symptoms begin with sudden onset of fever and other flu-like symptoms about one to two weeks after being infected. Five to nine days after the symptoms have started, a rash typically begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. This rash eventually spreads over most of the body, sparing the face, palms, and soles. Signs of meningoencephalitis begin with the rash and continue into the second or third weeks. Other signs of meningoencephalitis include sensitivity to light (photophobia), altered mental status (delirium), or coma. Untreated cases are often fatal. Causes Multiple diseases include the word \\"typhus\\" in their descriptions. Types include: { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Condition ! scope=\\"col\\"  Bacterium ! scope=\\"col\\"  Reservoir/vector ! scope=\\"col\\"  Notes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Epidemic louse-borne typhus  Rickettsia prowazekii  Body louse  When the term \\"typhus\\" is used without clarification, this is usually the condition described.

A vaccine has been in development for scrub typhus known as the scrub typhus vaccine. Treatment The American Public Health Association recommends treatment based upon clinical findings and before culturing confirms the diagnosis. Without treatment, death may occur in 10% to 60% of people with epidemic typhus, with people over age 60 having the highest risk of death. In the antibiotic era, death is uncommon if doxycycline is given. In one study of 60 people hospitalized with epidemic typhus, no one died when given doxycycline or chloramphenicol. Some people also may need oxygen and intravenous fluids. Epidemiology According to the World Health Organization, the current death rate from typhus is about one of every 5,000,000 people per year.WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS) Only a few areas of epidemic typhus exist today. Since the late 20th century, cases have been reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Algeria, and a few areas in South and Central America. Except for two cases, all instances of epidemic typhus in the United States have occurred east of the Mississippi River. An examination of a cluster of cases in Pennsylvania concluded the source of the infection was flying squirrels. Sylvatic cycle (diseases transmitted from wild animals) epidemic typhus remains uncommon in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have documented only 47 cases from 1976 to 2010. An outbreak of flea-borne murine typhus was identified in downtown Los Angeles, California in October 2018.CBS Los Angeles: \\"Downtown LA Hit With Outbreak Of Flea-Borne Typhus,\\" https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/10/04/downtown-la-skid-row- typhus-outbreak/, October 4, 2018. History Middle Ages The first reliable description of the disease appears in 1489 AD during the Spanish siege of Baza against the Moors during the War of Granada (1482‚Äì1492). These accounts include descriptions of fever; red spots over arms, back, and chest; attention deficit, progressing to delirium; and gangrenous sores and the associated smell of rotting flesh. During the siege, the Spaniards lost 3,000 men to enemy action, but an additional 17,000 died of typhus. In historical times, \\"jail fever\\", \\"gaol fever\\", or \\"Aryotitus fever\\" was common in English prisons, and is believed by modern authorities to have been typhus. It often occurred when prisoners were crowded together into dark, filthy rooms where lice spread easily. Thus, \\"imprisonment until the next term of court\\" was often equivalent to a death sentence. Prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected members of the court.Ralph D. Smith, \\"Comment, Criminal Law‚ÄîArrest‚ÄîThe Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest\\", 7 NAT. RESOURCES J. 119, 122 n.16 (1967) (hereinafter Comment) (citing John Howard, The State of Prisons 6‚Äì7 (1929)) (Howard's observations are from 1773 to 1775). Copied from State v. Valentine (May 1997) 132 Wn.2d 1, 935 P.2d 1294 Following the assizes held at Oxford in 1577, later deemed the Black Assize, over 300 died from gaol fever, including Sir Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The Black Assize of Exeter 1586 was another notable outbreak. During the Lent assizes court held at Taunton in 1730, gaol fever caused the death of the Lord Chief Baron, as well as the High Sheriff, the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when persons were executed for capital offenses, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the British realm. In 1759, an English authority estimated that each year, a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever. In London, gaol fever frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of Newgate Prison and then moved into the general city population. In May 1750, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Samuel Pennant, and many court personnel were fatally infected in the courtroom of the Old Bailey, which adjoined Newgate Prison.Gordon, Charles The Old Bailey and Newgate pp.331‚Äì2. T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1902 Early modern epidemics Epidemics occurred routinely throughout Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries, including during the English Civil War, the Thirty Years' War, and the Napoleonic Wars.War and Pestilence . Time magazine Pestilence of several kinds raged among combatants and civilians in Germany and surrounding lands from 1618 to 1648. According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, \\"By war's end, typhus may have killed more than 10 percent of the total German population, and disease in general accounted for 90 percent of Europe's casualties.\\" 19th century During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812, more French soldiers died of typhus than were killed by the Russians.The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus . Joseph M. Conlon. A major epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, during the famine caused by a worldwide reduction in temperature known as the Year Without a Summer. An estimated 100,000 people perished. Typhus appeared again in the late 1830s, and yet another major typhus epidemic occurred during the Great Irish Famine between 1846 and 1849. The Irish typhus spread to England, where it was sometimes called \\"Irish fever\\" and was noted for its virulence. It killed people of all social classes, as lice were endemic and inescapable, but it hit particularly hard in the lower or \\"unwashed\\" social strata. In the United States, a typhus epidemic broke out in Philadelphia in 1837 and killed the son of Franklin Pierce (14th President of the United States) in Concord, New Hampshire, in 1843. Several epidemics occurred in Baltimore, Memphis, and Washington, DC, between 1865 and 1873. Typhus was also a significant killer during the US Civil War, although typhoid fever was the more prevalent cause of US Civil War \\"camp fever\\". Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhii (not to be confused with Salmonella enterica, the cause of salmonella food poisoning), is a completely different disease from typhus. In Canada alone, the typhus epidemic of 1847 killed more than 20,000 people from 1847 to 1848, mainly Irish immigrants in fever sheds and other forms of quarantine, who had contracted the disease aboard the crowded coffin ships in fleeing the Great Irish Famine. Officials neither knew how to provide sufficient sanitation under conditions of the time nor understood how the disease spread. The clipper Ticonderoga was infamous for her \\"fever ship\\" voyage from Liverpool to Port Phillip carrying 795 passengers in 1852. The overcrowded ship was not designed well for passenger carrying, sanitary provisions were inadequate, and the ship's doctors were soon overwhelmed. During the voyage, 100 passengers died of what was later determined to have been typhus. 20th century Delousing stations were established for troops on the Western Front during World War I, but the disease ravaged the armies of the Eastern Front, where over 150,000 died in Serbia alone. Fatalities were generally between 10% and 40% of those infected and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick. In 1922, the typhus epidemic reached its peak in Soviet territory, with some 25 to 30 million cases in Russia. Although typhus had ravaged Poland with some 4 million cases reported, efforts to stem the spread of disease in that country had largely succeeded by 1921 through the efforts of public health pioneers such as H√©l√®ne Sparrow and Rudolf Weigl.Paul Weindling. International Health Organisations and Movements, 1918‚Äì1939. Cambridge University Press 1995, p. 99. In Russia during the civil war between the White and Red Armies, typhus killed 3 million people,Andrew W. Artenstein. Vaccines: A Biography. Springer 2010, p. 250David G. Rempel. A Mennonite Family in Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, 1789‚Äì1923. University of Toronto Press 2011, p. 249 mainly civilians. In 1937 and 1938 there was a typhus epidemic in Chile.Fever in Chile During World War II, many German POWs after the loss at Stalingrad died of typhus. Typhus epidemics killed those confined to POW camps, ghettos, and Nazi concentration camps who were held in unhygienic conditions. Pictures of mass graves including people who died from typhus can be seen in footage shot at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Among thousands of prisoners in concentration camps such as Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen who died of typhus were Anne Frank, age 15, and her sister Margot, age 19. Major epidemics in the postwar chaos of Europe were averted only by widespread use of the newly discovered DDT to kill the lice on millions of refugees and displaced persons. The first typhus vaccine was developed by the Polish zoologist Rudolf Weigl in the interwar period.Naomi Baumslag, Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, page 133 Better, less-dangerous and less-expensive vaccines were developed during World War II. Since then, some epidemics have occurred in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.

In 2019, city attorney Elizabeth Greenwood revealed that she, too, was infected with typhus as a result of a flea bite at her office in Los Angeles City Hall.

Exhibits include, for example, the classic gypsy Fortune teller machine that used to grace many a carnival sideshow. Most of the machines still function, so visitors are encouraged to bring change. . Marvin's is open 365 days a year. The museum's founder, Marvin Yagoda, had been collecting the items that populate the museum for over 60 years. He graduated from University of Michigan as a pharmacist taking over his fathers store Sam's Drugs in Detroit. Yagoda was a recognized expert in the field of mechanical and electrical game apparatus; he has been involved in appraisal of such items for the television series American Pickers.Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum spot on American Pickers television show Yagoda died on January 8, 2017, at the age of 78. Marvin's son Jeremy grew up in the business and carries on his fathers legacy. Amongst the collection is P. T. Barnum's replica of the Cardiff Giant. Another oddity is one of Sing Sing Prison's Electric Chairs in which 30 people died. An automaton \\"food inspector\\" is set up to continuously vomit into a pile of milk bottles. In popular culture Tally Hall, a band from nearby Ann Arbor, titled an album after the museum.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of Rickettsia was based on serology However, serologic tests often don't differentiate the species of Rickettsia and it takes about 15 days after the onset of symptoms for there to be diagnostically significant titers of R. tyhpi . And so the diagnosis is often confirmed after the patient has either recovered or died . Laboratory techniques such as real-time PCR and microimmunofluorescence can be used to identify Rickettsia down to the species level . Microimmunofluorescence is a highly sensitive test that is often used in endemic areas to confirm infection by R. typhi . The use of real-time PCR can allow for the detection and confirmation of R. typhi earlier than serological tests . Rickettsia typhi is a species of infectious bacterium of the genus Rickettsia; it is the causative agent of murine typhus. The genome is similar to that of Rickettsia prowazekii.

It is known as the roundear enope squid. The specific name honors the French zoologist and marine biologist Alfred Mathieu Giard (1846-1908). Pterygioteuthis giardi from Carl Chun's Die Cephalopoden  Anatomy and Morphology  Squid in the family Pyroteuthidae have Photophores (small, light-producing organs) on viscera (internal organs), stalk of tentacles, and five large and ten small photophores underneath the eyes. The squid has a wide, triangular mantle with a rounded posterior end and rounded fins on the distal dorsal end of the mantle. Their mantles are generally less than 34 mm long. Their tentacles look like bent clubs due to their permanent constriction. Adult squid in the Pterygioteuthis genera lack hooks on their tentacular clubs, but do have some hooks on the arms. Male squid have a specialized arm used to transfer sperm to females called hectocoyli. Females do not have suckers on their ventral arms and only have one oviduct developed.  Distribution and habitat  Squid in the Pyroteuthidae family live in the mesopelagic (midwater or twilight zone) during the day. At night, they migrate to the epipelagic waters (0-200m). There is little knowledge about the life history of these squid due to the difficulties in studying them, but research on P. gemmata estimated its maximum age to be 78 days, and it is presumed that others in the Pyroteuthidae family have similar life-spans. Similarly, there is little species-specific information about diet, but in a study of diets of cephalopods in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, it was found that P. giardi feed on small crustaceans such as copepods. P. giardi inhabits the Atlantic ocean between 40¬∞N and 34¬∞S and temperate regions (north and south) of the Pacific, but is not found in the eastern tropical Pacific. Off the coast of Hawaii, P. giardi was found much more abundantly on the leeward (wind-protected) side of the inner boundary zone than the windward zone. Based on data from a study conducted in Hawaii, it was proposed that P. giardi might be a facultative- boundary species, which means that it can live in the boundary between the mesopelagic and neritic (coastal) zones but does not have to in order to survive. Predators of P. giardi vary by location but they include some large dolphins and fish. In the south Pacific, a study of the diet of the Guadalupe Fur Seal showed that it also preys on P. giardi.  Behavior  In laboratory experiments, P. giardi has been observed to produce a luminescent flash when shocked with an electrode. It is likely that the squid use these flashes as a defense against predators. Organisms with photophores often also use luminescent flashes to attract prey or engage in mating rituals. P. giardi is also able to use Counter-illumination (break up their silhouette with light from photophores) under light conditions similar to those in the upper mesopelagic zone.  Taxonomy  P. giardi is a part of the P. giardi clade along with P. hoylei, which was originally classified as a subspecies of giardi, but was changed to species classification in 1987. P. giardi and P. hoylei are now recognized to be sister species.  Conservation status  P. giardi is listed as a least concern species on the IUCN Red List. However, they list the need for further research into species-specific population size and dynamics, life history, ecology, and threats.

Favianna Rodriguez (born September 26, 1978) is an American artist and activist. She has self-identified as queer and Latina with Afro-Peruvian roots. Rodriguez began as a political poster designer in the 1990s in the struggle for racial justice in Oakland, California. Rodriguez is known for using her art as a tool for activism. Her designs and projects range on a variety of different issues including globalization, immigration, feminism, patriarchy, interdependence, and genetically modified foods. Rodriguez is a co-founder of Presente.org and is the Executive Director of Culture Strike, \\"a national arts organization that engages artists, writers and performers in migrant rights. \\"  Background  Rodriguez was born in the Fruitvale neighborhood of east Oakland, California in 1978. Her parents are Peruvian, having migrated to California from Peru in the late 1960s. Rodriguez's artistic talents emerged at a young age; during primary school Rodriguez won art contests and once appeared on Spanish television to share her artwork. Her parents supported her art but pressured her to pursue a career in medicine or engineering. Fruitvale is a predominantly Latinx neighborhood and here Rodriguez experienced and became aware of anti-Latinx racism. She observed that students from her community were under-served by the school system and profiled as gang members while she only saw negative representation of women of color in the media. Reportedly, in order to better shape her adolescence, Rodriguez went to live in Mexico City from age 13 to 15, first with her aunt and then in a rented room. Here she became interested in politically engaged artwork, learning the political context of murals and the work of Frida Kahlo with whom she immediately identified with. Upon her return to Oakland, she became involved with activism and other Latinx organizers. She created the first Latino club at her school. When she was 16, California Proposition 187 was introduced, marking state level anti-immigrant legislation. After graduating from Skyline High School in 1996, Rodriguez received numerous scholarships and chose to attend the University of California Berkeley. She withdrew at age 20 indicating she wanted to follow her own path rather than limit herself to her parents‚Äô wishes. She was inspired by printmaking, introduced to her by Chicana artist Yreina Cervantez, and decided to pursue a career in political art. Art and activism Rodriguez was drawn to posters and reproducible art like printmaking for their power to educate, organize, and liberate communities. Her illustrations have become synonymous with grassroots efforts to defend a variety of issues ranging from ethnic studies, immigrant and women's rights, affirmative action to patriarchy, interdependence, food justice, environmental and racial justice, sustainability, and youth activism. Rodriguez's art is typified by high- contrast colors and graphic figures. Rodriguez is renowned for her bold posters on immigration, racism, war, globalization, and social movements. Rodriguez has worked closely with artists in Mexico, Europe, and Japan, and her works have appeared in collections at Bellas Artes, The Glasgow Print Studio, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2008, Rodriguez was named one of Utne Reader magazine's ‚Äú50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World.\\" Organizational involvement Rodriguez is the Executive Director and co- founder of CultureStrike, a national network of artists and activists who support the national and global arts movement around immigration. She serves on the board of Presente.org, a national online organizing network dedicated to the political empowerment of Latino communities. She served as interim co- director until August 2016. Rodriguez has helped establish multiple organizations to support local communities and artists. She is co-founder of Tumis Inc., a bilingual design studio providing graphics, web, and technology development for social justice. Rodriguez also co-founded EastSide Arts Alliance and Cultural Center, an organization of artists and community organizers intended to promore community sustainability through political and cultural awareness and leadership development. In 2003, with Jesus Barraza, Rodriguez helped establish the Taller Tupac Amaru print studio to promote the practice of screen printing among California-based artists and foster its resurgence. She is also a member of the Justseeds Cooperative which distributes prints and publications about social and environmental movements. Through these programs, Rodriguez has mentored dozens of emerging young artists and helped establish a multi-use arts facility in the heart of working-class East Oakland. Rodriguez has lectured at over 200 schools widely on the use and power of art in civic engagement and the work of artists who work to bridge community and museum, the local and international. She also lectures on cultural organizing and technology to inspire social change, and leads art workshops at schools around the country. A few of the many schools Rodriguez has lectured at include UC Santa Cruz, Stanford, Michigan State, and Syracuse University. Influences Rodriguez has been influenced by the Chicano Movement and feminist art of the 1970s and 1980s. She has studied the history of political art, including the artwork and graphics associated with the Black Panthers and the 1970s feminist movement, through her residency at the Center for the Study of Political Graphics in Los Angeles. Artists that influence Favianna Rodriguez include: Ester Hernandez, Yolanda Lopez, Rufino Tamayo, Rupert Garcia, Romare Bearden, Pablo Picasso, Taller de Grafica Popular, Ospaaal, Wangechi Mutu, Frida Kahlo, Swoon (artist), and Malaquias Montoya. Projects In 2013, Rodriguez worked with the YouTube channel I Am Other to create Migration is Beautiful, a three-part documentary series that addresses the debate surrounding immigration policy in the United States and the perception of immigrants. She is the co-author of Reproduce and Revolt with Josh MacPhee.url=http://www.justicedesign.com/pop_rr.html publisher= Justice Design title=Reproduce & Revolt Additionally, Rodriguez is a contributor to the Creative Commons. Rodriguez is well known for her work through an organization called CultureStrike, to promote and sell her poster work that focuses on themes such as environmentalism, immigration, and feminism. Rodriguez's posters have a distinctive and colorful style that takes inspiration from her Latin-American roots with contemporary context. Her work has been shown all over the US and internationally. One of her current projects is Pussy Power, which seeks to redefine the pussy as a source of empowerment. Rodriguez's most recent project in November 2018, is her work with ice cream company, Ben & Jerry's. Rodriguez designed fantastical and colorful packaging for the limited edition flavor, Pecan Resist, which was created to resist the Trump administration. As part of the project, Ben & Jerry's is donating $25,000 to Neta, Color of Change, Honor the Earth, and the Women's March. The design depicts two characters: one is a gender-queer character with their fist up in the air and the other, which holds a sign that reads \\"resist\\", is wearing a hijab to pay homage to one of Rodriguez's close friends. The design is vibrant and colorful, and works to empower minorities.https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/01/oakland-artist-favianna- rodriguez-is-the-face-behind-ben-and-jerrys-new-anti-trump-pint/ Awards and honors *2012 Emerging Leader Award, Chicana Latina Foundation, San Francisco, CA *2011 Recipient of the Creative Work Fund Award, San Francisco, CA *2011 Recipient of Innovation Grant, Center for Cultural Innovation, Los Angeles, CA *2010 Inducted into Women's Hall of Fame (Alameda County) in Arts & Culture, Alameda County, CA *2009 Recipient of OPEN Foundation Individual Artist Grant, Oakland, CA *2008 Named one of the countries leading 50 visionaries by UTNE Magazine *2008 Sister of Fire Award, Women of Color Resource Center, Oakland, CA *2007 Recipient of the Belle Foundation Individual Artist Award, San Jose, CA *2005 Art Is A Hammer Award from the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, CA Exhibitions  United States  * Museo del Barrio (New York) * de Young Museum (San Francisco) * Mexican Fine Arts Center (Chicago) * Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco) * Sol Gallery (Providence, RI) * Huntington Museum and Galer√≠a Sin Fronteras (Austin, TX) * Multicultural Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara, California)  Abroad  * the House of Love & Dissent (Rome) * Parco Museum (Tokyo) In addition, her works have been displayed in England, Belgium, and Mexico.

The cannon was a result of the Royal Ordonnance of October 7, 1732, enacted to reorganize and improve the King's artillery.A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War By Andr√© Corvisier, p.837 De Valli√®re 24-pdr guns, Les Invalides. Whereas numerous formats and designs had been in place in the French army, De Valli√®re standardized the French sizes in artillery pieces, by allowing only for the production of 24, 12, 8 and 4 pound guns, mortars of 13 and 9 inches, and stone-throwing mortars of 16 inches. The 24-pdr was the largest caliber available to French artillery in this system. The cannon used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze, a method developed at that time by Jean Maritz, which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface, and therefore higher shooting efficiency. As with other de Valliere guns, the 24-pdr was also highly decorated and contained numerous designs and inscriptions. Front part Starting with the front part, the gun had a sight design at its extremity. They followed the name of the gun (here Uranie). Then, a Latin phrase \\"Ultima Ratio Regum\\", initially introduced by Louis XIV, and rather descriptive of the role of the gun: \\"The Last Argument of Kings\\". Under that appears the name \\"Louis Charles de Bourbon, Comte d'Eu, Duc d'Aumale\\", the Grand Ma√Ætre de l'artillerie de France (Grand Master of the Artillery of France), followed by a royal emblem. In the middle of the cannon are trunnions, used to position the gun in place and elevate or depress it. On top of the trunnions are dolphin-shaped ornaments, which are used in lifting the gun.Springfield Armory Back part The back part consists in, sometimes, an inscription showing the weight of the cannonball (for example a \\"4\\" for a 4-pounder), followed by a Latin inscription \\"Nec pluribus impar\\", meaning that the King is \\"Not unequal to many (suns)\\". This is followed by the royal crest of the Bourbon dynasty. At the bottom of the gun, the location and date of manufacture are inscribed (in the example \\"Strasbourg, 1745\\"), and finally the name and title of the founder (in the example \\"Fondu par Jean Maritz, Commissaire des Fontes de France\\"). The cascabel is decorated with an animal face showing the rating of the gun (the lion head for a 24-pounder). Image:De_Valliere_gun_front.jpgFront part of the de Valliere 24-pdr gun Uranie.

In 2016 Senator Mayne sponsored a bill which will create a feasibility study to determine how postal service workers can be utilized to aid with emergency response efforts. This bill was supported by Representative Jason Chaffetz as part of his effort to make the postal service more universal.

Although all the band members hail from the United States, the band were among the most successful Hispanic or \\"Chicano rock\\" acts founded in the United States during the 1980s. Throughout Latin America, the band is known as Los Renegados. Background Renegade was formed by drummer Luis Cardenas and the band's manager/producer Kim Richards.Renegadeusa.com Deney Terrio, host of Dance Fever, introduced Renegade in what is believed to be their first national television appearance as being from \\"Whittier, California\\". The band members were unusual in being ethnic Hispanics playing rock music, and this proved to be a barrier for Renegade during their early years.Ritmo Beat Magazine Renegadeusa.com Manager Richards, a music industry veteran, was unable to get the band booked at local Los Angeles clubs as a result of their skin color and a perception that a group of \\"Mexicans\\" would bring in spray cans and knives. He told Performance magazine: > \\"[T]here used to be a place called Flippers Roller Disco in West Hollywood > that booked bands and had a lot of industry people hanging out.

Richards opted to go the opposite direction and promoted the band's ethnicity, persuading the then head of WEA Distribution Nesuhi Erteg√ºn to release the band's single, \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" in Latin America. Its popularity resulted in a worldwide release of the band's first album, Rock N' Roll Crazy!. \\"Los Renegados\\", as the band is known throughout Latin America, became a household name based on a combination of the band's teen idol appearance and the fact they were Latin. Success (1985‚Äì1990) Renegade was the Saturday night headline attraction for the Los Angeles Street Scene Festival in both 1985 and 1986, with audiences of 150,000 in attendance. The band released four albums: Rock n' Roll Crazy, Renegade II ‚Äì On the Run, Nuns on Wheels and Renegade Live. The band sold well in Mexico, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and locally in California, but did not enjoy the same level of success throughout the United States as they did internationally. In the United States, Renegade was widely viewed as teen idols, appearing in Tiger Beat, 16 Magazine, Bop and on television programs, such as Dance Fever. The band played music festivals alongside bands such as 38 Special, Foreigner, Journey and Night Ranger, and was popular enough in the late 1980s to be asked by Kenny Rogers to appear on the Texas-New Mexico Border with Lionel Richie and Lee Greenwood to support Rogers' Hands Across America effort. In 1990, the band was featured in a 98-minute television special aired on MTV International, entitled Renegade MTV Special. The band was honored in August 2001 at a David Hasselhoff-hosted event at the Conga Room in Los Angeles for record sales in excess of 30 million units worldwide. Reformation and current activities (2000 to present) Renegade waves to crowds during the annual East Los Angeles Parade In 2001 Renegade reformed and headlined a performance at the Los Angeles Staples Center for Infinity Broadcasting shortly after the September 11 attacks to raise funds for victims. In 2002, the band announced another charity concert at the Hollywood House of Blues to benefit the Music Cares effort to put music back into schools. Renegade invited a number of their industry friends, such as Vivian Campbell (Def Leppard), Mike Pinera (Iron Butterfly, Blues Image and Alice Cooper) and Mick Fleetwood (Fleetwood Mac) to join them. The show was filmed and released on DVD.Renegade Live @ The House of Blues, Youtube.com In an interview with the band in April 2001 Ritmo Beat magazine described Renegade as the first Latin rock band, calling them \\"Chicano rock-gods\\".Ritmo Beat Magazine Article, Renegadeusa.com Luis Cardenas solo projects In 1986 Cardenas held the world record for having the world's largest drumkit and released a solo album entitled Animal Instinct. The album's lead single, a cover of the Del Shannon song \\"Runaway\\", reached number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100 and its video, featuring cameo appearances by Shannon and Donny Osmond, was nominated for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards.

History  The original Parrish High School building opened in 1920 on the present site of Parrish Elementary School. The school was moved in 1935 to a site on the hill to the west of the elementary school. This site was consumed by fire in 1979 and subsequently moved to its current location just off Alabama 269. An on-campus football stadium was built some years later, named Harland-Nelson Stadium. In 2014, the Walker County Board of Education voted to close the high school after the 2013-2014 school year along with Sipsey Jr. High School and T.S. Boyd Elementary School due to budget constraints. Parris High School students not graduating that year were transferred to two nearby schools; they chose between either Oakman High School in Oakman or Cordova High School in Cordova.

Fred Fife for the party nomination earlier that year. Early life, education, and career The daughter of two Mexican college professors, Escamilla was born in 1978 and raised in Mexico. After moving to the United States in 1996, Escamilla graduated from Marian Catholic High School in San Diego, CA. She then earned her Bachelor of Science at the University of Utah in business marketing in 2000. She also holds a Masters in Public Administration, which she earned from the University of Utah in 2005. Luz is married to former Arizona lawmaker Juan Carlos Escamilla. He proposed to Luz on the Utah Senate floor during the 2014 legislative session. Luz Escamilla is a director for the Zions Bank Business Resource Center. She is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who are often referred to as Mormons. Political career Senator Escamilla serves as the minority assistant whip in the Utah State Senate. Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. appointed Escamilla to the State Office of Ethnic Affairs in 2005. In 2010, she received the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce Pathfinder Award and the SBA Award. She has also received the Pete Suazo Memorial Award from the University of Utah. Senator Escamilla has also served as a board member for the University of Utah College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the Regence Caring Foundation, the Utah Health Policy Project, and the Primary Children's Medical Center. Escamilla was first elected to the Utah State Senate in 2008, and was re-elected in 2012. In 2016, Escamilla served on the Executive Appropriations Committee and the Social Services Appropriations Subcommittee. [4] She also served on the following Senate standing committees: * Senate Ethics Committee * Senate Government Operations and Political Subdivisions Committee * Senate Health and Human Services Committee * Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee. In 2014, Escamilla ran for Congress in Utah's 2nd congressional district. The seat was held by Republican incumbent Chris Stewart, who won reelection. In 2019, Sen. Escamilla ran for mayor of Salt Lake City, after Mayor Jackie Biskupski announced she would not run for another term.\\"Sen.

Immigrants would have to pass a criminal background check and learn English to obtain the permit. Immigration experts have hailed Escamilla's immigration bill and Escamilla herself as \\"ground breaking\\" and \\"creative.\\" While her SB60 did not pass, it was a model for a guest worker program that ultimately did pass the 2011 Legislature. Escamilla has also proposed a bill that would protect the rights of fathers against fraudulent adoption practices. SB 63 would have allowed a compact of states to share punitive father's records. This would help protect father's rights if mothers took their children out of the state without the father's knowledge. The bill was not voted on the floor before Utah's 45-day session was completed. Escamilla introduced a bill to fund the Utah Department of Environmental Quality to install air and water monitors at the site of the proposed Utah Inland Port, to establish baseline readings for future comparison. An environmental impact study of the proposed port has not been completed.

The other legislations enacted during this time include the Hindu Marriage Act (1955), the Hindu Succession Act (1956), and the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956). All of these acts were put forth under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, and were meant to codify and standardise the current Hindu legal tradition. The Adoptions and Maintenance Act of 1956 dealt specifically with the legal process of adopting children by a Hindu adult, and with the legal obligations of a Hindu to provide \\"maintenance\\" to various family members including their wife or parents, and in-laws. Application This act applies to Hindus and all those considered under the umbrella term of Hindus, which includes: * a Hindu by religion in any of its forms or development; * a Buddhist, Jain or Sikh; * a child legitimate or illegitimate whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs; * a child legitimate or illegitimate one of whose parents are Hindus, Buddhists, Jains or Sikhs and has been so brought up; * an abandoned child, legitimate or illegitimate of unknown parentage brought up as a Hindu, Buddhist, etc.; and * a convert to the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh religion. Persons who are Muslims, Christians, Parsis or Jews are excluded from this definition. The act does not also apply to adoptions that took place prior to the date of enactment. However, it does apply to any marriage that has taken place before or after the Act had come into force and Moreover, if the wife is not a Hindu then the husband is not bound to provide maintenance for her under this Act under modern Hindu Law. Adoptions Who can adopt? Under this act only Hindus may adopt subject to their fulfilment of certain criteria. The first of these asserts that the adopter has the legal right to (under this Act that would mean they are a Hindu). Next, they have to have the capacity to be able to provide for the adopted child. Thirdly the child must be capable of being adopted. Lastly, compliance with all other specifications (as outlined below) must be met to make the adoption valid. Men can adopt if they have the consent of their wife or of all of their wives. The only way of getting around obtaining the permission of the wife or of the wives is if she or if they are unsound, if they have died, if they have completely and finally renounced the world, and if they have ceased to be a Hindu. Men who are unmarried can adopt as well as long as they are not a minor. However, if a man were to adopt a daughter, the man must be twenty one years of age or older. Only unmarried Hindu women can legally adopt a child. A married woman can only give her consent to adoption by her husband. A married woman whose husband adopts a child is to be considered the mother. If the child is adopted and there are more than one wife living in the household, then the senior wife is classified as the legal mother of the adopted child. Who can be adopted? The adopted child can be either male or female. The adopted child must fall under the Hindu category. The adoptee also needs to be unmarried; however, if the particular custom or usage is applicable to the involved parties then the adoptee can be married. The child cannot be the age of fifteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur if there is not a child of the same sex of the adopted child still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house. Legal implications for an adopted child From the date of the adoption, the child is under the legal guardianship of the new adopted parent(s) and thus should enjoy all the benefits from those family ties. This also means that this child, therefore, is cut off from all legal benefits (property, inheritance, etc.) from the family who had given him or her up for adoption. Maintenance Maintenance of a wife A Hindu wife is entitled to be provided for by her husband throughout the duration of her lifetime per Section 18 of HAMA '56. Regardless of whether the marriage was formed before this Act was instated or after, the Act is still applicable. The only way the wife can null her maintenance is if she renounces being a Hindu and converts to a different religion, or if she commits adultery. The wife is allowed to live separately from her husband and still be provided for by him. This separation can be justified through a number of different reasons, including if he has another wife living, if he has converted to a different religion other than Hinduism, if he has treated her cruelly, or even has a violent case of leprosy. If the wife is widowed by her late husband, then it is the duty of the father-in-law to provide for her. This legal obligation only comes into effect if the widowed wife has no other means of providing for herself. If she has land of her own, or means of an income and can maintain herself then the father-in-law is free from obligation to her. Additionally, if the widow remarries then her late husband's father-in-law is not legally bound by this Act anymore as well. Maintenance of a child or of aged parents Under this Act, a child is guaranteed maintenance from his or her parents until the child ceases to be a minor. This is in effect for both legitimate and illegitimate children who are claimed by the parent or parents. Parents or infirmed daughters, on the other hand, must be maintained so long as they are unable to maintain for themselves. Sections 20-22 of the Act cover the same, and provide for the maintenance of any dependents of an individual. Amount of maintenance provided The amount of maintenance awarded, if any, is dependent on the discretion of the courts. Particular factors included in the decision process include the position or status of the parties, the number of persons entitled to maintenance, the reasonable wants of the claimants, if the claimant is living separately and if the claimant is justified in doing so, and the value of the claimant's estate and income. If any debts are owed by the deceased, then those are to be paid before the amount of maintenance is awarded or even considered.

The 120 bedroom complex focuses on the treatment and rehabilitation of children and providing support to their families during treatment. History From the beginning of Mahak‚Äôs activities, the need for creating facilities to help children with cancer became the long-term goal of the organization. With the help of one of the friends of Mahak a piece of land located in Darabad heights was purchased through the Urban Land Organization. The project was left on hold however, due to lack of funding and the size of the project. At this stage a generous donor joined Mahak and provided funding to the tune of four times the original budget. That enabled Mahak to expand its plans from 2000 Sq. M. (21,000 sq. ft.) to 8000 Sq. M (86,000 sq. ft.). The work began in year 2000 and the speed with which the building project was progressing encouraged the major sponsor to commit further funds to ensure the conclusion of the project and its further expansion to the limits set by building regulations. This increased the size of the project to twice the original plans. Finally in 2003 Mahak 's Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, was completed. The two Rehabilitation wards in Mahak were set up and made operational with the help and co- ordination of the nursing group and social work department by August 2003. The center is situated above the city's northeastern heights and boasts an 18000 square meters building with 120 rooms equipped to accommodate patients accompanied by one member of their families. Facilities The center houses diagnostic and treatment wards of the highest standards . There are also further facilities offered such as a Clinic, a Chemotherapy laboratory, Radiotherapy section, Physiotherapy ward, Water-therapy section, Operation rooms, M.R.I and CT-Scan, Radiology, ICU, Library, Children's playroom, Restaurant, an Amphitheatre and a Shopping center. These various parts of the complex have been furnished with the help of charitable individuals and in order to appreciate their generosity, each section has been named after the donor. By February 2007, final operational permits were granted by the Ministry of Health and the opening ceremony was held in April 2007.

Named for the company's famous production of Zeppelin engines prior to and during World War I, it was an enormous luxury vehicle which weighed approximately 3000 kg (6600 lb). This weight was so great that German drivers required an additional goods vehicle licence for vehicles over 2¬Ω tons. Along with the Voisin, and behind the Daimler Double Six, this was Europe's joint second luxury V12 car in production. DS7 The DS7 (Doppel Sechs 7) version featured a 7.0 L (6,971 cc) V12 engine that produced 150 horsepower at 2,800 rpm. It was available from 1929 to 1930. Work began in 1928 on a model simply called the \\"Maybach 12\\" which went on sale in 1929. In 1930 it was re-branded as the DS7 and the \\"Zeppelin\\" badge appeared on a bar between the headlamps; although adopted universally as the \\"Maybach Zeppelin\\", this was never the car's official model. Karl Maybach's engine was a long- stroke design, with dimensions of 86√ó100 mm. The crankshaft had eight main bearings, one being a smaller outrigger at the rear, supporting the camshaft drive gears. In a novel feature for reduced noise, these were made of Novotext, a resin-impregnated fibre composite. A further novel feature was the use of enlarged four-bolt main bearing caps on three of the bearings. DS8 Supplementing the DS7 from 1930 was the DS8 (Doppelganger). It sported an 8.0 L (7977 cc, 486 cubic inches) V12 which made at a fairly low 3200 rpm, putting the DS8 among the most powerful production cars in the world at the time. Depending on the weight of the coachwork, a top speed of was possible. In August 2012, a 1938 DS8 Roadster sold for ‚Ç¨1.3 million at auction, fitted with a rare Variorex eight-speed gearbox (both the first 8-speed and first 8-speed manual gearbox) with a vacuum shift and is thought to be one of only 100 built. Revival When Maybach was revived as a brand by DaimlerChrysler, old Maybachs, particularly the opulent 8-litre Zeppelin, saw new popularity as part of a marketing effort which sought to link the current brand with the heritage of the original car company. This resurrecting of the classic name resulted in increased visibility and popularity of well-restored or preserved Maybachs.

Biography Leith-Ross was born in Saint Pierre, Mauritius, the son of Frederick William Arbuthnot Leith- Ross, a banker, and his Dutch wife, Sina van Houten, the daughter of politician Samuel van Houten. He grew up with his grandfather John Leith Ross, 5th Laird of Arnage Castle at the family estate in Scotland. He was the brother of the artist Harry Leith-Ross (1886‚Äì1973). After graduating with a double first from Balliol College, Oxford, he joined the Treasury in 1909. Leith-Ross was appointed as a Private Secretary to H. H. Asquith, the prime minister, in 1911. Between 1932 and 1945 he was chief economic advisor to the UK government: he is known for advancing the economic theory of \\"Treasury View\\", popular in the 1930s. Leith-Ross was active in negotiations with Germany prior to the Second World War but is best remembered for the \\"Leith- Ross mission\\" to China in 1935, when he was the UK's chief representative in a mission to persuade China to reform its currency.A History of Modern Shanghai Banking, Zhaojin Ji, 2002Shanghai's Bund and Beyond, Niv Horesh, Yale University Press, 2009 He was also chairman of a bank in China and chairman of P&O.; During the Second World War, Leith-Ross helped to lay the foundation for international humanitarian relief efforts in the postwar period. Following a speech of prime minister Winston Churchill to the British Parliament on 20 August 1940 that rhetorically raised the prospect of Britain bringing the German and Austrian peoples \\"food, freedom, and peace\\" upon the defeat of the Nazi regime in Europe, Leith-Ross was appointed to head an ad hoc governmental committee to address the question of how surpluses could be raised to deliver on such a pledge.Shephard, Ben. The Long Road Home: The Aftermath of the Second World War. New York: Knopf, 2011. 33‚Äì34. In September 1941, his committee was reconstituted as the Inter-Allied Committee on Post-War Requirements, in which form it collaborated with the European governments in exile in London, on estimating the needs for food, raw materials, and other necessities in the first six-month period after liberation.Shephard, 35. Leith-Ross's committee laid the groundwork for what eventually became the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), founded in November 1943. As deputy under the UNRRA's first director-general, the American Herbert Lehman, Leith-Ross contributed to the difficult work of organizing and staffing the new international agency,Shephard, 56, 59. which, in the end, received the mandate not of feeding German civilians but, rather, of fulfilling basic needs of the millions of people displaced from their homelands as a consequence of the war, who needed assistance to be repatriated or to otherwise re-establish their lives in the postwar period. The term displaced persons, which came into parlance at that time, and shaped the understanding of the postwar landscape, may have even originated in Leith- Ross's committee and the report it produced.Shephard, 38‚Äì39, 51‚Äì52. In 1912 Leith-Ross married Prudence Staples. Their children include the author Prudence Leith-Ross. His 1968 autobiography is entitled Money Talks: Fifty years of international finance.

Belgian hagiographers such as Macaire mention Armenian preachers in Gand in the year 1011. But the meaningful Armenian presence started with Armenian merchants appearing starting first half of the 14th century mainly related to the trade of carpets in Bruges. By 1478 Armenians had established a hospice. Also in Bruges, Armenian merchants also started importing cotton goods, spices, perfumes and other materials from the Orient and exporting European goods to markets in the East. Their presence continued well into the 15th century. While the Armenian presence in Belgium was not broken throughout the centuries, the size of the community did not start growing considerably until the end of the First World War and the forced mass exodus of Armenians from Turkey following the 1915 Armenian Genocide. Armenians were known for their trades in carpets and rugs, tobacco and jewelry. In the tobacco sector, original Armenian brands like Davros, Arax, Marouf and Enfi were the only cigarette brands made in Belgium. Behind each of these names were Armenian families, mostly immigrants from Turkey, who had settled in Belgium at the turn of the 20th century. The Missirian, Tchamkertian, Matossian and the Enfiadjian families held a monopoly over the tobacco industry in the country. As more refugees poured into Belgium from Turkey after 1915, these families became the major employers. Another sector the Armenians of Belgium excelled in was trade of diamonds.Recession takes the sparkle out of Antwerp's diamond quarter  World news. The Guardian. Retrieved on 2011-06-02.

Belgium is also one of the countries to have recognized the Armenian Genocide which continues to be denied by Turkey. On April 23, 2015, the Flemish Parliament of Belgium unanimously adopted a resolution to fully recognize the Armenian Genocide. The motion was put forward by all political parties of Flanders including the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams party. The motion further called on Turkey to recognize the massacres as a genocide.

Its area is 185 square km, volume 0.7 cubic km.Chogray Reservoir (Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences) Besides capturing water naturally brought by the tributaries of the East Manych River, the reservoir receives water from the Terek River and the Kuma River over the Kuma-Manych Canal, which was completed a few years before the reservoir.

V. Ramasamy resulted in him being considered the Voltaire of South India. Both opposed religion virulently because, in their views, the so-called men of religion invented myths and superstitions to keep the innocent and ignorant people in darkness and to go on exploiting them.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. ix. Periyar has been a harsh critic of the Aryan influenced Hinduism in Tamil Nadu, more than the faiths of Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. He has spoken appreciatively of these other faiths in India finding in their ethics principles of equality and justice, thus advocating them if they can prove an alternative to Brahamanic Hinduism. With regards to institutionalized religion being used for personal gain, Periyar stated that \\"religion goes hand in hand with superstition and fear. Religion prevents progress and suppresses man. Religion exploits the suppressed classes.\\" As religions, however, they are prone to be hit by accusation of superstition, exploitation and irrationalism.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, p.55. Hinduism In Periyar's school of thought, there was no religion by name Vedic Hinduism derived from the name of a place. With no distinct doctrines and no particular sacred book, it was said to be an imaginary religion preaching the superiority of the Brahmin the inferiority of the Shudra, and the untouchability of the Panchama.Saraswathi, S. Towards Self-Respect, pp. 118 & 119. Maria Misra compares him to the philosophes, Through the Self-Respect Movement,Periyar preached that compared to other religions, Hinduism placed many restrictions on men by prohibiting all except a small minority of Brahmins from reading the religious texts or discussing religious matters and by evolving a caste system in the name of divine law, and by creating several gods and festivals to provide an assured income and prosperity to the small Brahmin group at the expense of all others.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 119. Regarding Mahatma Gandhi's views on Hinduism and Hindu Varnashramadharma, Periyar wrote:\\"The day when Gandhi said God alone guides him, that Varnashramadharma is superior system fit to govern the affairs of the world and that everything happens according to God's will, we came to the conclusion that there is no difference between Gandhism and Brahminism. We also concluded unless the Congress party that subscribes to such philosophy and principle is abolished it will not be good to the country. But now this fact has been found out at least by some of the people. They have gained wisdom and courage to call for the downfall of Gandhism. This is a great victory to our cause\\".https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/periyar-admired-bhagat-singh- criticised-gandhiji/article2379711.ece When the ideal of Dravidian nationalism was projected in the 1940s, Periyar's religious philosophy also underwent a modification to assert that Hinduism was not the religion of the Dravidians. There was no Dravidian Veda and the Aryan Vedas prevalent among Dravidians were said to be the sacred books which prescribed how Dravidians should be treated but put a bar on Dravidians from acquiring a knowledge of these texts. In his Presidential Address at the Justice Confederation in 1940 EVR said:Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 121. \\"We have to bring about certain reforms in our religion. Many of our countrymen think that they are Hindus. When you call yourself a Hindu you admit Aryan principles. The words Hindu and Hinduism were not used by our forefathers in any of their works. Historians of world religions say that the sacred books of the Hindus are the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Agamas, the Puranas and the Itihasas. You will notice that none of the ancient religious works of the Dravidians have been included among those religious books. A careful study of the Vedas, etc., proves beyond doubt that they were written with a view to disgrace, enslave and exploit the Dravidians. It is this Hinduism which says that we are Sudras and Rakshasas. Again it is this Hinduism which is responsible for the introduction of caste distinction and growth of feud among the sons of the soil. All our superstitions and meaningless and absurd rituals and ceremonies are the result of following the tenets of Hinduism. In addition to our social subjugation and enslavement it paved the way for our political enslavement also by Aryans. If we think calmly we shall see that it is as necessary to be free from Hinduism in the field of religion as it is to be separated from Aryavarta in the field of politics.\\" Thanthai Periyar, even while upholding rationalism, executed his duties of a \`dharmakartha' of a temple at Erode, to everybody's appreciation. Marai Malai Adigal is an eminent Tamil Saivite scholar who founded Saiva Siddhantha Association. He lived as a Saiva saint. This orthodox Saiva scholar was once invited by Thanthai Periyar to stay in his place or ashram. Maraimalai Adigal agreed to stay with Periyar for a month. In that one month, Periyar respected the orthodoxy of Adigal and ordered not to cook non- vegetarian food in the ashram and instructed his aides not to do anything that would offend the saiva practices of Adigal. Periyar respected true believers. Islam Ramasamy said \\"Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans\\". In his book \\"Vedangalin Vandavalangal\\", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible. In the early days of the Self-Respect Movement when Periyar was vociferous that Hindu religion, Manudharma and the Congress should be destroyed, he was inclined to play a political game by expressing an opinion that Islam alone was the religion that carried political weight and those depressed in the Hindu order could consider conversion to Islam.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, p. 124. For eradicating the evil of 'shudrahood', the threat of conversion was occasionally exercised. The Dravidian movement repeatedly complained about the imposition of Aryan religion on Dravidians. \\"Unless we become either the Panchama, i.e., Adi Dravida or Muslims, we will not get respect, justice and progress,\\" said EVR. He clarified that the idea was not to place the Dravidian people under the authority of Muslim religious leaders abroad but to practice the tenets of equality, righteous conduct and mutual respect. He emphasized that he was not an advocate of Islam but was only trying to find a remedy to the sufferings under Aryan, brahminical system and to find a rightful place for Dravidians in the independent country.Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect, pp. 124 & 125. Buddhism Peiyar found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion as self-respect movement. The search for basis began in the course of the movement and was intensified soon after independence. It was again an experiment in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the shudrahood of Hinduism. A conference to propagate Buddhism was convened in Erode on 31 January 1954.Saraswathi. Towards Self- Respect, p. 125. Later that year, he and his wife [He married Maniammai when he was 74 years old] went to Burma to attend the celebration of the 2500th anniversary of Buddha.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, p. 28. Periyar stated that what he was propagating could be found in the teachings of Buddha given 2000 years ago and wanted to revive them as the independent government had accepted the wheel of the Buddha and Hindus have regarded Buddha as an avatar. Brahmins were accused of covering Buddha within the Aryan religion as they had been hiding Tiruvalluvar within the Aryan fold. EVR pointed out that Buddha also laid stress on rationalism, on intellect as the precept, and on thought process for accepting anything. The persecution of Buddha by Brahmins, the burning of Buddhist institutions and teachings and the 'export' of Buddhism to China, Japan and Ceylon were recalled at the conference and Periyar observed that Buddha Vihars at Srirangam, Kanchi, Palani and Tirupati were converted as Hindu temples. Christianity Periyar said \\"Bane of Tamils is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamilans\\". In his book \\"Vedangalin Vandavalangal\\", he had separate chapters where he criticized Quran and Bible. He was against evangelical movement of DGS Dinakaran and fought with him on this issue. In Periyar's publication, Naathigan, he used to vehemently oppose and criticize Dinakaran calling him fraud. Christianity was viewed by Periyar similar to monotheistic faith of Islam. He stated that, \\"So far as god is concerned we find the Christians and Muslims, somewhat reformed from the olden days of barbarians. They say that there can be only one God. They say that it is beyond human comprehension. They say that God does good to those who are good and punishes those who are bad. They say that God has no name or shape. They talk of good qualities\\".Veeramani, Collected Works of Periyar, p. 495. He took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. See also *Periyar E. V. Ramasamy Notes References * Diehl, Anita, (1977). E. V.

Tapetum is important for the nutrition and development of pollen grains, as well as a source of precursors for the pollen coat.P.L. Polowick, V.K. Sawhney 1993. Differentiation of the Tapetum During Microsporogenesis in Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), with Special Reference to the Tapetal Cell Wall. Annals of Botany, Volume 72, Issue 6, December 1993, Pages 595‚Äì605 The cells are usually bigger and normally have more than one nucleus per cell. As the sporogenous cells undergo mitosis, the nuclei of tapetal cells also divide. Sometimes, this mitosis is not normal due to which many cells of mature tapetum become multinucleate. Sometimes polyploidy and polyteny can also be seen. The unusually large nuclear constitution of the tapetum helps it in providing nutrients and regulatory molecules to the forming pollen grains. The following processes are responsible for this: * Endomitosis * Normal mitosis not followed by cytokinesis * Formation of restitution nuclei * Endoreduplication Tapetum helps in pollenwall formation, transportation of nutrients to inner side of anther, synthesis of callase enzyme for separation of microspore tetrads.  Types of tapetum  Two main tapetum types are recognised, secretory (glandular) and plasmodial (amoeboid). In the secretory type a layer of tapetal cells remains around the anther locule, while in the plasmodial type the tapetal cell walls dissolve and their protoplasts fuse to form a multinucleate plasmodium. A third, less common type, the invasive non- syncytial tapetum has been described in Canna, where the tapetal cell walls break down to invade the anther locule but do not fuse to form a plasmodium. Amongst the monocots Acorales, the first branching clade has a secretory tapetum, while the other alismatid clade, Alismatales are predominantly plasmodial. Amongst the late branching clades, the lilioid monocots are nearly all secretory while the commelinid monocots are diverse with respect to tapetal pattern.

Shark fin law Fong introduced Assembly Bill 376 (AB 376) which was passed by the legislature and signed into law. This law bans the possession, sale, and distribution of shark fins, with some exceptions.Official California legislative bill information on AB 376 The intent of the law is to discourage shark finning, a practice which involves cutting off the tails and fins of living sharks, which are then thrown back into the ocean to die. The primary use of shark fins is in shark fin soup, an expensive delicacy which because of its high cost was in former times restricted to being consumed by the Chinese aristocracy. With increasing availability of shark fin in modern times, shark fin soup is now often served on special occasions such as weddings and banquets, and is available in many Chinese restaurants. Fong, who was born in China, says, \\"Anything that is unhealthy, that the culture is practicing, we should stop doing it. We used to bind women's feet and that was unhealthy for the woman\\".Official Website - Assemblymember Kevin Mullin Representing the 22nd California Assembly District Hawaii's former first lady Vicky Cayetano drew a similar comparison: \\"shark fin soup is about as cultural as bound feet.\\" However, State Senator Leland Yee argued that the bill constituted \\"the wrong approach and an unfair attack on Asian culture and cuisine... rather than launch just another attack on Asian American culture, the proponents of the ban on shark fin soup should work with us to strengthen conservation efforts.\\"Senator Leland Yee Throws Down: Goes to Chinatown, Supports a Nuanced Approach to Shark Fin Soup ¬´ San Francisco Citizen AB 376 was approved by the California Assembly on 5/23/11 by a vote of 65 to 8.

Pursuant to the new law, it became illegal on January 1, 2013, for any person in California to possess, sell, offer for sale, trade, or distribute a shark fin, unless the person holds a special license or permit for that purpose issued by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Similar laws have been enacted in the states of Hawaii, Washington,Washington bans sale, trade of shark fins Oregon,Oregon House of Representatives bills of 2011 Oregon's shark fin bill was HB 2838 by Representative Brad Witt. Passed Senate unanimously, passed House 58 to 1. Signed into law by Governor John Kitzhaber on 2011-06-16. and Illinois, and in Venezuela, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. A member of China's National People's Congress has submitted a formal written proposal to that Congress that shark fin be banned in the People's Republic of China. Also, the Chinese government has announced that it will prohibit official banquets from serving shark fin soup by the end of 2015. A poll commissioned by the Monterey Bay Aquarium found that 70 percent of the Chinese-American voters surveyed favored making it illegal to sell or distribute shark fins. Proponents and opponents Proponents of AB 376 included the Asian Pacific American Ocean Harmony Alliance (APAOHA), Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Humane Society of the United States, WildAid, Sea Stewards, Sierra Club California, California Academy of Sciences, California Coastal Commission, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense Fund, Food Empowerment Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, and The Nature Conservancy. Opponents of AB 376 included Asian Food Trade Association, Chung Chou City, Inc., Oriental Food Association, and Stockton Seafood Center. Generally, opponents included shark fin fisheries, traders, and processors, and Chinese restaurants that served shark fin soup. Opponents hired two lobbying firms, Lang Hansen O'Malley & Miller and Sloat Higgins Jensen & Associates, to guide their campaign against AB 376. Fuller lists of the proponents and opponents are found in the Analysis of AB 376 released by the California State Senate's Committee on Natural Resources and Water. Endorsements Chinese-born NBA Basketball player Yao Ming campaigned for the shark fin ban; he filmed a public service announcement in San Francisco promoting the banning of shark fin soup. Two Chinese-American candidates in the 2011 San Francisco Mayoral race, David Chiu (President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors) and Phil Ting (the Assessor-Recorder of the city and county of San Francisco), came out in support of the shark fin ban. Betty Yee (member of California's State Board of Equalization) also endorsed AB 376. The San Francisco Chronicle (Editorial endorsing AB 376) and the Los Angeles Times (Editorial endorsing AB 376) both printed editorials endorsing AB 376.

The book redefined the meaning of the term \\"open marriage\\" and helped foster a sexual revolution in the 1970s. The O'Neills conceived open marriage as one in which each partner has room for personal growth and can develop outside friendships. Most chapters in the book dealt with non- controversial approaches to revitalizing marriage in areas of trust, role flexibility, communication, identity, and equality. The authors intended \\"to strip marriage of its antiquated ideals and romantic tinsel and find ways to make it truly contemporary.\\" However, chapter 16, entitled \\"Love Without Jealousy\\", devoted 20 pages to the proposition that an open marriage could include some forms of sexuality with other partners. These concepts entered the cultural consciousness and the term \\"open marriage\\" became a synonym for sexually non-monogamous marriage, much to the regret of the O'Neills. In the 1977 publication of The Marriage Premise, Nena O'Neill advocated sexual fidelity in the chapter of that name. By then however, the concept of open marriage as sexually non-monogamous marriage had gained a life of its own. The marital suggestions in the book were largely conventional, even at the time. The New York Times writes that some of its \\"bolder suggestions [now] seem not so much daring as painfully na√Øve.\\" The book stressed that women should lead meaningful lives, in alignment with feminist ideas.

In this novel, the author brings out the twin issues of child trafficking and sex slavery, painfully living through the experiences of the many children that are trafficked to Europe each year. Having lived in Europe since the age of fourteen, Abidemi Sanusi uses her experience as a human rights worker specializing in conflict and gender issues to weave a complex story that evokes both anger and a sense of helplessness. It was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 2010. Syonpsis Eyo, an illiterate 10-year-old girl is trafficked to the UK with promises of a better life. The novel follows her five-year journey as a domestic servant and eventual sex slave in the UK, her attempts to escape and her journey around the UK as she's passed from one human trafficker to another. Eventually, she is rescued only to realise that in even in freedom, society demands an exacting price from those it should protect. The novel starts with Eyo's life in one of Nigeria‚Äôs most notorious slums and follows her journey from Lagos, Nigeria, to the UK. She is put to work immediately by her abductors who beat and threaten her daily to keep her pliable. She is an illiterate, illegal immigrant with no family, friends nor means of escape. How does she escape? Who can she turn to for help and how does she endure? Plot summary In the story an illiterate ten-year-old girl, Eyo, is trafficked to the United Kingdom by her father with promises of work, an education and a fortune. And thus begins her five-year ordeal, first as a domestic servant and then as a child sex slave. Eventually, she is rescued from slavery by a Catholic priest and nun and sent back home to Nigeria with a view to rebuilding her life. However, she finds out that even in freedom, society demands an exacting price from those it should protect. In the first of the four parts of the book, entitled \\"African Flower\\", the story opens with Eyo and her young brother, Lanre, eking out a living by selling iced water in Ajegunle, a sprawling slum in Lagos, Nigeria. Christened Jungle City by its residents, life is harsh and brutal, both day and night. One must have nerves of steel to survive. Eyo finds herself warding off petty thieves and molesters in the streets, and an amorous landlord at home. But it is her father, Wale, who sexually harasses her with the full knowledge of her mother. She's willing to play her father's sex toy as long as he does not touch her five-year-old sister Sade. Plagued by financial problems, Wale approaches his old friend, Femi, to take Eyo away from Jungle City. Uncle Femi, a human trafficker and once a resident of Jungle City, has grown wealthy from illicit trade. He agrees to take Eyo to London where she would get an education and thereafter a good job and with it a fortune. She would be sending money and other things home to help her siblings. Perhaps when she's settled she'd send for her siblings and they too would get an education and a job. Upon arrival in London, she's taken to a couple who have \\"bought\\" her to take care of their children. She's \\"imprisoned\\" in the house where she is forced to do household work from early in the morning till late in the night. She not only works forcefully, but she is also assaulted physically at the slightest provocation. Soon, Sam, the man of the house, starts to sexually assault her and, having discovered her skills, which were learned from her experiences with Wale her father, begins to play pimp. It is only when she miscarries that the couple gets rid of her by \\"selling\\" her to another pimp, Big Mama. At Big Mama's, Eyo performs well, thanks to her experience at Jungle City. She becomes Big Mama's favourite sex provider and income earner. In this second part of the book, entitled ‚ÄúAfrican Lolita‚Äù, Eyo comes face to face with the harsh reality of commercial sex and worst of all sex slavery. Despite the earnings she brings to Big Mama through clients‚Äô fees and other compliments, she does not get anything better than rationed food. She has to satisfy clients whatever and whenever Big Mama desires. Fearing that Eyo might gain her freedom through her clients, Big Madam passes on the \\"sex slave\\" to another pimp named Johnny. Johnny is both crude and violent constantly unleashing terror on Eyo whenever she fails to comply with his orders. He also makes pornography using her. Now having given up on the earlier promises, she sinks into helplessness and is no longer sure that she's human anymore. She refuses to be called Eyo again and adopts the name \\"Jungle Girl\\", the title of the third part of the book. While with Johnny, who also doubles up as her boyfriend, Eyo encounters the tireless Father Stephen and Sister Mary who have devoted their lives to rescuing girls like Eyo from the streets. After numerous attempts by the duo to get to Eyo, they only managed when Eyo sought asylum at the Sanctuary. It is here that Eyo rediscovers herself and, with the help of Nike, a human rights lawyer, starts the road to recovery. Nike is also determined to bring the perpetrators of this inhuman practice to book. But to her surprise, the underground network that runs the trade is so deep-rooted that it is difficult to uproot.

Fort Levett was a former U.S. Army fort built on Cushing Island, Maine beginning in 1898. Located in Cumberland County, Maine, in Casco Bay near Portland, Maine, the fort was heavily fortified with guns for coastal defense. Conceived under the Endicott Program in 1885 and begun in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Fort Levett was manned during both World Wars.Joyce K. Bibber and Earle G. Shettleworth Jr., Postcard History Series: Portland, Arcadia Publishing, 2007 It was part of the Coast Defenses of Portland, later renamed the Harbor Defenses of Portland, a command which protected Portland's port and naval anchorage 1904-1950. The fort's name is sometimes mis-spelled as \\"Fort Leavitt\\". History Fort Levett was built on of Cushing Island, and the coast artillery fortification was visited by several Secretaries of War, including Jacob M. Dickinson in 1909.Dickinson on Visit to Our Army Posts, The New York Times, July 5, 1909 The fort, whose call letters were FV, was part of a network of forts guarding Portland Harbor and Casco Bay under the Coast Defenses of Portland (Harbor Defenses after 1925), which included Levett, Fort Williams on Portland Head, and Fort McKinley on Great Diamond Island as well as Fort Preble. Fort Scammel and Fort Gorges, once strongly fortified and guarding the harbor entrance, were decommissioned earlier than the previous three forts, and were not modernized after the 1870s.The New International Encyclopedia, Vol. XIV, Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore, Dodd, Mead & Co., New York, 1903 The forts were built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, maintained by the Army's Ordnance Department, and after 1907 were manned by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. Namesake Fort Levett was named for English explorer Captain Christopher Levett, an early explorer of the New England coast and the first European to settle what is today Portland, Maine.A Handbook of New England, Porter Sargent, George H. Ellis Co., Boston, 1917 King Charles I of England granted Levett to found a city the explorer proposed to call York, after his English birthplace. (Today's York County, Maine carries the name of Levett's birthplace.) Levett founded a plantation in 1623, leaving a group of Yorkshiremen and women behind, and he returned to England. The settlement subsequently failed, and the colonists were never heard from again. Levett never returned to Maine. Construction and armament Fort Levett's construction began in 1898 (on land acquired in 1894) and was largely completed in 1903. The fort initially comprised five batteries. Battery Bowdoin was named for James Bowdoin, former governor of Massachusetts (which included Maine in his day), and had three 12-inch M1895 disappearing guns. Battery Kendrick was named for Henry Lane Kendrick, an Army officer and professor at West Point, and had two 10-inch M1895 disappearing guns. Battery Ferguson was named for Major William Ferguson, killed in action against Native Americans in 1791, was completed in 1906, and had two 6-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts. Battery Daniels was named for Lieutenant Napoleon Daniels, killed in action against Native Americans at Crazy Woman's Fork in 1866, and had two 3-inch M1898 guns (also called 15-pounder guns) on retractable masking parapet mounts.Fort Wiki article on Fort LevettBerhow, p. 202 The fort also briefly had several 6-pounder rapid-fire guns on field mounts. Public Documents of Massachusetts, Published by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Vol. X, Wright & Potter Printing Co., Boston, 1904 In addition to its artillery, the fort also operated as a wireless telegraph station. In order to furnish its base with water, the army dug four wells on Cushing Island. The island presented other challenges as well. In full view of the battery of artillery was a large summer hotel. \\"This hotel,\\" noted a War Department report, \\"is so near that the guns can not be fired without causing much damage to the building. The occupants of this hotel, if it is allowed to remain there, will be practically in the fort, while the soldiers who garrison the fort will live in barracks at a considerable distance from their guns.\\"Annual Reports, United States War Department, Vol. III, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1905 Although the owners of the hotel wished the army to purchase it to billet its men, the army resisted the offer, and chose instead to erect its buildings nearby.Hearings Before Subcommittee of House Committee on Appropriations, Sundry Appropriation Bill for 1905, Government Printing Office, Washington, 1904 The army subsequently erected cook tents and frame buildings at the fort. The fort had a base field hospital for the soldiers. All of the initial post buildings were completed by 1905. The fort was a sub- post of Fort Williams, and by 1910 was in caretaker status, with only a small garrison for maintenance, as there was no immediate threat to the area. World War I In 1915, with World War I raging in Europe and with rapidly improving dreadnought battleships providing an increased threat, the Board of Review recommended that Fort Levett receive a new, modernized battery as part of a program to increase the range of coastal forts. The battery was named Battery Foote in 1919, after Colonel Stephen M. Foote, a Coast Artillery officer who died in that year. Battery Foote had two 12-inch M1895 guns on new, high-angle M1917 barbette carriages for increased range and was completed in 1920. This type of battery was initially built in the open, relying on camouflage for concealment, and was incredibly vulnerable to air attack, as were the older disappearing batteries. The two 10-inch guns of Battery Kendrick were ordered dismounted as part of a railway artillery program in 1917, but were not shipped out and were soon remounted. Fort Levett was operationally manned during the war, but probably not until the American entry into World War I in 1917. After World War I the two 3-inch guns of Battery Daniels were removed as part of a decommissioning of several types of guns. At some point between the wars the fort reverted to caretaker status. World War II In June 1939 a quartermaster survey showed that most of the 28 buildings at Fort Levett were in \\"poor\\" or \\"uninhabitable\\" condition. In June 1940 the post was in similar condition and still in caretaker status, but things were about to change. Shortly after the Fall of France in mid-1940 the United States manned its coast defenses, activated the National Guard, and developed a coast defense modernization program that was partially implemented during the war. During World War II the Harbor Defenses of Portland were garrisoned by the 8th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Regular Army and the 240th Coast Artillery Regiment of the Maine National Guard until late 1944, when the Coast Artillery was reorganized and reduced in strength.Berhow, pp. 467‚Äì471 At Fort Levett, by June 1941 the older buildings had been rehabilitated and 26 temporary buildings had been added or planned, increasing the fort's capacity from 124 to 758 men. The basis of the World War II modernization program was to add new 16-inch gun batteries, retain long-range 12-inch batteries such as Battery Foote, and also add new long-range 6-inch gun and 90 mm gun batteries. The disappearing gun batteries that had served for 25‚Äì45 years would be scrapped. The 16-inch battery that anchored the Harbor Defenses of Portland was Battery Steele on Peaks Island. Battery Foote was casemated against air attack during the war, and a four-gun 90 mm Anti- Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) battery designated AMTB 962 was added. The other batteries of Fort Levett were scrapped by 1943 except the two 6-inch guns of Battery Ferguson, which were retained until after the war. Postwar With the end of World War II in 1945 all US coast defense guns were scrapped by 1948, and subsequently the obsolete Fort Levett was sold by the government, which asked $177,000 for the property.Science Island, TIME magazine, May 2, 1969 It was bought by a group of Cushing Island residents after it was decommissioned.

Their products are sold throughout all of Western Europe. The company was established in 1888 by Mr. Francesc Queralt Roca in Arb√∫cies, a village in the Selva county of the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. This small town offered the advantage of being in the midst of a densely forested area (\\"Selva\\" means \\"forest\\" in Catalan), useful since the bodyworks were made of wood at the time. It was the first of several cochbuilders to be based in Arb√∫cies; it would be later followed by Ayats, Beulas, Noge and Boari.

The translation, from 1876 to 1880, was published and said to be linguistically richer than the first translation of the Protestants. It was the second Bible translation in the Arabic language. The first translation was approved by the American Protestant missionaries under the leadership of the missionary Cornelius Van Dyke, a professor at the American University of Beirut along with two Christian Lebanese writers and philologists Butrus al- Bustani and Nasif al-Yaziji, Ibrahim al-Yaziji's father. Their Bible translation appeared in 1866. One of Yaziji's most significant innovations was the creation of a greatly simplified Arab font. By reducing Arabic character forms from 300 to 60 he simplified the symbols so that they more closely resembled Latin characters. It was a process that contributed to the creation of the Arabic typewriter. The Bible translations of BustƒÅni, Nasif al-Yaziji and Ibrahim al-Yaziji were the first in modern Arabic language.

Biography Duke was born in Melbourne, grew up in the suburbs of Melbourne and took up skating at St. Moritz Ice Skating Palais on the Upper Esplanade, St. Kilda in 1946. As a young man he was interested in joining the Police force but at 5‚Äô10\\" was under the regulation height of 6 ft. He became interested in speed skating & ice hockey and played in the Juniors for the Saints Monarchs, but speed skating was his main interest. With his longtime school friend David Morgan, in 1948 he became a founding member of the Melbourne Amateur Speed Skating Club, for which he wrote the constitution. He was later the first Secretary-Treasurer of the Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council. In the same year he won the Victorian Junior ¬º and ¬Ω mile championships before going on to win the Australian Junior ¬º mile championship. He successfully defended his Victorian Junior ¬º mile title the following year. Len won several Victorian and Australian titles over the years and at 17 he was a member of the 1951 Victorian team to go to Sydney to compete in the Australian Championships. That same week he won three Senior titles, ¬º mile, ¬Ω mile and 1 mile, setting new Australian records for all three although still a Junior. These records are listed along with those of many other skaters‚Äô in the Ampol Book of Sporting Records 1951‚Äì87. He also took the Rushall Trophy for being 'Victoria's best skater over all distances'. For a time was unable to race due to a serious bike accident after which he was encased in plaster from neck to waist for 6 months. Len was eventually able to become a member of the Commonwealth Police Force in his 40s due to a reduction in the height requirement. Unfortunately, he was struck down in 1983 with a brain tumour at 51 and died 6 months later in March 1984. The eponymous Duke Trophy was donated by Len Duke to the AAIRC in 1952 to encourage interstate competition in speed skating. In the early 2000s, his children returned his trophies to the Victorian Speed Skating Union, one of which was modified to become the Best & Fairest trophy for the Duke Perpetual competition.

They number around 6,000ArmenianDiaspora website and mainly live in Vienna. There is also the very important presence of the Mekhitarist Order in Vienna that plays a major role in the country as well as worldwide.  History   Prior to the late 18th century  The history of Armenians in Austria dates back to the time of Vienna's liberation from the Turkish siege at the end of the 17th century, when several Armenian merchants found a new market in the Habsburg empire. In fact, the city's characteristic coffee culture was established and run for a long time in its early decades by Armenian merchants. The very first documented coffee house in Vienna was opened on 17 January 1685, by Johannes Deodat (or Diodato, known in Armenian as Owanes Astouatzatur - ’Ö’∏’æ’∞’°’∂’∂’ß’Ω ‘±’Ω’ø’∏÷Ç’°’Æ’°’ø’∏÷Ç÷Ä - some sources claiming him to be Greek).  After the 1770s Austrian annexations of Galicia and Bukovina  In 1772-1774, the Austrian Empire annexed Galicia (see Austrian Partition, as part of the late-18th century Partitions of Poland) and especially the formerly Moldavian Voivodeship of Bukovina (see Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca; today a part of the Ukraine), which at the time held the largest area contiguously settled by Armenians in Europe, and the Bukovian and Galician Armenians automatically became subjects to the Empire. In 1775, Maria Theresa gave official permission to the Mechitarist Congregation of the Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire. The Mekhitarian congregation in Vienna contributed to the spread of Armenian culture in central Europe through its printing, its library and its college for Armenian boys. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Austrian Armenians enjoyed officially recognized status as an autonomous religious community. The Armenian community in Vienna grew constantly, so that already in 1896 the first efforts were made to found an Armenian-Apostolic community. In 1912, a small chapel was established in Vienna.  WWI and its aftermath  World War I and its aftermath transformed the Austrian Armenian community: The area of the Bukovina Armenians was lost during the war, but a wave of immigrants came to Austria as a result of the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. After 1918, Galicia became part of a re-established Poland again, while the Bukovina region and much of its Armenian population became part of Romania (and in 1947 was turned over to the USSR and today the Ukraine, which prompted most of its Armenian population to leave to Poland and Czechoslovakia after 1947). After the appointment of the first Armenian pastor in Vienna in the 1920s, the number of Armenians in Austria continued to grow, also boosted by refugees from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, as well as migrant Armenian workers from Turkey and more recently from Armenia.  After 1945  In 1968, the Surp Hripsime Armenian Apostolic Church of Vienna was consecrated, giving a new impetus to the ever growing Armenian community in Austria. There is also a Saturday Armenian School named Hovhannes Shiraz. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1996. Armenia has an embassy in Vienna and Austria is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia).  Mechitarist Order in Vienna (1810-Present)  Although the monastic headquarters of the Mekhitarist Order founded by Mekhitar da Pietro(1676-1749), an Armenian Catholic monk is on the island of St. Lazarus in Venice (San Lazzaro Monastero Armeno in Italian), the Mechitarists have kept an important presence in Vienna since 1810. Even much before, actually in 1775, Maria Theresa had already given the official permission to the Mechitarists congregation of the Armenian Catholic Church to settle in the Habsburg Empire and they had established in Trieste. By 1810, they established a new monastic center in Vienna using a Franciscan church. When in 1835, the church the Order was using burnt down completely, the Mechitarists hired the services of one of the most famous architects of Vienna of the time Josef Kornh√§usel for constructing a new church. Due to financial issues, the construction of the designed church failed to materialize for a few decades. When the church was finally built, a new architect called Fritz Sitte had already altered the designs considerably. He, and later his son Camillo Sitte finished building the church in 1874. Vienna Congregation is not just a religious center, but a veritable cultural center for Armenians as well. The monks especially cultivated the Armenian language, Armenian history and Armenian literature and published all of the old Armenian writers' works with commentaries under the title of \\"National Library\\". Aydinian of Vienna wrote the fundamental textbook of modern Armenian grammar in 1866; Tschamtschian (1738-1823) published a 3-volume history in Venice (which then belonged to Austria), and in Vienna Garagaschian (1818-1903) wrote a 4-volume history of Armenia. The Vienna branch has been publishing Handes Amsorya, a scholarly publication on Armenian linguistics and philology, since 1887. The library of the Mechitarist Congregation, founded in 1773, owns a special collection of Armenian and Oriental manuscripts (approx. 153,000 vols., 2,000 manuscripts, numismatic collection). The Library has recently announced the formation of the digital list of the Library's books and manuscripts available online. An association was formed for the propagation of good books worldwide to all Armenian communities, and a high-quality printing press that published average of six new works each year. A herb liquor called ‚ÄúMechitharine‚Äù and produced by the monks is said to contain 43 herbs and 12 fruits ‚Äì the precise ingredients and recipe remains is a secret and known by only two monks at a time. The Mechitharine is still produced today and sold commercially by the monks.

He is best known for composing music for The Wizard of Oz, the 1902 stage adaptation of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, one of the great popular hits of its era. Tietjens was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. At age 14 he appeared as a piano soloist with the St. Louis Symphony. He later studied in Europe with Hugo Kaun, Harold Bauer, and Theodor Leschetizky. Early in his career, Tietjens's ambition was to establish himself as a successful composer of comic operas and operettas. He approached L. Frank Baum in March 1901, not long after the publication and success of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. According to Baum's later recollection, :\\"The thought of making my fairy tale into a play had never even occurred to me when, one evening, my doorbell rang and I found a spectacled young man standing on the mat.\\"Mark Evan Swartz, Oz Before the Rainbow, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000; pp. 27‚Äì28. By another report, though, they met through Ike Morgan, a Chicago artist who worked on Baum's American Fairy Tales (1901). Baum and Tietjens agreed to develop stage projects together. Curiously, their first attempts had nothing to do with Oz.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 106. They wrote a show titled The Octopus, or The Title Trust, which was rejected by producers in Chicago and New York. Their next venture was a musical called King Midas, which was never completed. It was illustrator W. W. Denslow who suggested a Wizard of Oz stage adaptation. Though Baum was at first cool to the idea, Tietjens was enthusiastic. Baum prepared a libretto, and the project went forward. Tietjens included two songs from The Octopus (\\"Love Is Love\\" and \\"The Traveler and the Pie\\"). The show went through many script revisions and changes; Tietjens's score was supplemented with music composed by A. Baldwin Sloane and others. Quarrels over the partitioning of the royalties (Denslow was co-copyright holder of the book, and designed the sets and costumes for the musical) led to a permanent rupture between Baum and Denslow. Yet the show premiered in Chicago on 16 June 1902, and moved to Broadway in January 1903. It was an enormous hit.L. Frank Baum, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Edited with an Introduction and Notes by Michael Patrick Hearn; revised edition, New York, W. W. Norton, 2002; Introduction, pp. lvi- lxi.Rogers, pp. 106‚Äì08. It ran through 1907 and then toured widely. The income from the show made Tietjens financially independent at a relatively early age. Tietjens, however, never equalled that early popular success in subsequent shows. He wrote The Sacred Serpent (1904), a three-act musical comedy. He composed incidental music for J. M. Barrie's play A Kiss for Cinderella. He worked with Baum on another project, called The Pipes o' Pan (which might have been a revised version of King Midas); it was never produced, and survives only in a fragment.Rogers, p. 185.Alla T. Ford, The Musical Fantasies of L. Frank Baum (1969) In 1904 he married the poet Eunice Strong Hammond, who became known under her married name, Eunice Tietjens.Philip A. Greasley, General Editor, Dictionary of Midwestern Literature: Volume One, The Authors, Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 2001; pp. 495‚Äì96. They had two daughters, Idea and Janet. The death of their elder daughter Idea at the age of four contributed to the break-up of the marriage; the couple divorced in 1914.Eunice Tietjens, The World at My Shoulder, New York, Macmillan, 1938. In addition to his works for popular theater, Tietjens composed symphonies, a concerto, sonatas, and chamber works. His most significant serious work is arguably his opera The Tents of the Arabs. Tietjens spent much of his life in Europe. When his health failed in 1942, he returned to St. Louis to live with his sister, and died there the following year. His manuscripts are in the Gaylord Musical Library at Washington University; the University's Tietjens Hall is named in his honor.

He had previously had trials with Norwich City and Cardiff City before being signed by Palace. Evans' league debut came for Palace on 6 February 1999 when he was a late substitute, for Leon McKenzie in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Birmingham City. He made four further substitute appearances later that season. The following season he played just twice, against Crewe Alexandra in the league and against Colchester United in the League Cup. He missed most of the 2000‚Äì01 season through injury, returning for the final game of the season as a late substitute for Wayne Carlisle in a 4‚Äì2 win away to Portsmouth. Evans joined Swansea City on loan in November 2001, playing six times in the league and twice in the FA Cup. He returned to Crystal Palace, but was allowed to join Brentford on a free transfer in March 2002. He was released by Brentford in May 2004.

The engine was used initially in the Holden HT series; it was later utilised in the Torana and Commodore ranges. The final iteration, the HEC 5000i, was phased out in Holden passenger vehicles upon the release of the VT II Commodore in mid 1999, which featured the Gen III V8 imported from the United States. The engine continued in the VS III Commodore utility which continued to be sold alongside the VT model until the new generation VU Ute debuted in late 2000. VS III Statesman continued with the Holden V8 engine also for a short while until the new WH Statesman was released in 1999. In addition to being Holden's mainstream performance engine throughout its production run, it was also a popular powerplant for kit cars and specials as well as for motorsport in Holden's efforts in the Australian Touring Car Championship and the Bathurst 1000 until 1995. Australian company Repco developed and built the Repco-Holden Formula 5000 engine for Formula 5000 and other racing applications using the block and head castings of the Holden V8 as its basis.Repco advertisement, \\"Guide to the Gold Star, Supplement to Racing Car News, August 1972, page xvi The engine featured many modifications including Lucas fuel injection and dual coil Bosch ignition and more than 150 special components designed by Repco. The lifter bore angle in the engine block is 45 degrees from the block centerline.  Applications  Initially offered in versions, the engines were intended to be offered as part of the 1968 Holden HK range, but the project ran behind schedule and instead became part of the 1969 HT model range. In the HT, the Holden V8 sold alongside the Chevrolet Small-Block engine until 1974 with the introduction of the HJ series.Holden Ltd ‚Äì The Holden Heritage, 8th Edition (1998) V8 The V8 engine also appeared from 1971 in the Statesman range of large size luxury cars which Holden established as a separate marque, replacing the Holden badged Brougham. In 1974, both the 253 and 308 engines were added to the Torana range for the first time in the LH series (after an aborted attempt by Holden Dealer Team boss Harry Firth to introduce the V8 to the smaller LJ Torana range in 1972 which was stopped by the Supercar scare). The engines were also offered on the LX model range introduced in 1976, but not the final UC range which appeared in 1978. Both engine capacities were offered on the first VB Commodores which appeared in 1978. The 253 version was not available in the VK Commodore range, released in 1984, but continued in Holden WB commercials until their cessation in late 1984. In 1985, the special editions modified by Holden and their official after-market tuner, Peter Brock's HDT Special Vehicles, began introducing the version of the engine, created to slip underneath the engine capacity cut-off in Group A touring car regulations, allowing Commodore competitors to run at a lower competition weight. This slight shrinking of the traditional Holden 308 saw the Group A Commodore's racing weight drop from . Due to the complex Group A regulations, this also allowed the racing cars to run bigger wheels and tyres without any drop in power. Indeed, the VK Commodore SS Group A was one of the fastest cars in the world of Group A racing when it hit the tracks in 1986. HDT Special Vehicles also offered a more powerful version of the engine enlarged to in some of its VL models between 1986 and 1988, including the controversial Calais Director. This engine, making as much as , was an expensive option, particularly once Holden severed ties with HDT in February 1987, which drastically increased the prices of all HDT models, and consequently very few of the 5.6-litre motors were made. Fuel injection replaced the carburettors initially on the VL Commodore SS Group A SV, again with Group A touring car racing in mind, this car produced by Holden's new performance vehicle partner Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in partnership with British-based Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR). While Group A disappeared after the VN model range, the fuel injected engine was offered in Commodores until the VS III Commodore utility in 2000, although there were no longer V8 VS III utilities available for sale during the latter part of 2000. HSV vehicles featured a variety of more powerful versions of the 5.0-litre, which were also available on regular V8 Holdens as part of the SV Enhanced package. Additionally, from 1994 with the VR series, a \\"stroker\\" was standard on the HSV GTS and optional on the HSV Senator, and later on the Statesman/Caprice-based Grange from that model's introduction in 1996.

Generally the arisan is a social gathering that takes place at a fixed interval (this being an informal social network this may be variable), at each member's home in turn. The rotating arisan holder (drawn by lots) receives payment from each other member and provides food for those members. In the course of the arisan the amount paid to other members will equal the amount received when the arisan is held. The arisan can vary from an essential form of credit in poorer social circles, funding an otherwise unaffordable business venture, wedding, or large purchase, to a purely social gathering for rich housewives with the money incidental (although the amounts can be considerable). As a source of finance it represents an alternative to bank loans and other forms of credit.Hospes, O. (1996). Women's differential use of ROSCAs in Indonesia. In S. Ardener and S. Burman (Eds.).

In general, no interest is payable per se in the arisan, and forms vary regionally within Indonesia. In some cases the arisan lacks a social element and is simply a means of circulating money between members; in this case the arisan may take the form of an 'arisan call', known as 'julu julu' or 'jula jula' in Sumatra.

In 2005, he joined Llanelli, becoming the club's first full-time player since the Jock Stein era in the 1950s. At Llanelli, Jones was voted into the Welsh Premier team of the season for the 2007‚Äì8, 2008‚Äì9 seasons, 2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12. Over the next 7 years, Jones made almost 200 appearances for the side and in that time at the club won the League, League Cup and Welsh Cup and qualified for the UEFA Europa League on several occasions. He has also earned caps for both the Wales Under 21s and the Welsh Semi Pro squads, and has been named in the Welsh Premier Team of the Year on no less than 4 occasions. Jones joined Aberystwyth Town in 2012. Stuart was a rock in the Centre of Defence in the 2014/15 as the Black and Greens managed an excellent fourth-placed finish. He received six nominations from rival Managers for last year's WPL Team of the Season. Based in Borth, Jones signed for his local Welsh Premier League club in May 2012, and took on the role of Club Development Officer alongside his playing duties. Since joining Aber in 2012, he has made over 100 appearances in Black and Green, scoring 10+ times, including a vital header at TNS towards the end of the season. Overall, he has made over 300 WPL appearances, scoring 20+ goals. It is telling, and quite remarkable that none of these appearances have been as a substitute. On 4 August 2019, Jones returned to hometown club Aberystwyth Town.https://www.atfc.org.uk/home/stuart-hones-in-on-more-success-at-park- avenue Career statistics {  + Club statistics - ! rowspan=2  Club ! rowspan=2  Season ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  National Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Other ! colspan=2  Total - !

It was placed in the section Mexicanae of genus Psilocybe by Gast√≥n Guzm√°n due to its rhomboid-shaped spores. It has been found in Koh Samui, a small tropical island in Thailand, where some psychoactive species are consumed by both natives and tourists. Description The cap is typically 7-15 mm in diameter, almost convex to conic in shape, umbonate with a small papilla. The cap is viscid and has a separable pellicle. It is a reddish-brown color when moist, but becomes lighter brown when dry. The stipe is 4.0-6.5 cm high √ó 1.5 cm thick, equal or slightly bulbous. The stipe is hollow, whitish in color, and covered with white fibrils. It is the same color as the cap, and stains blue when bruised. The odor and taste are slightly like grain meal (farinaceous). Spores have been recorded in the range of 10.4-12.8 by 6.4-8 Œºm and have a thick wall with a flattened, broad germ pore. Habitat Psilocybe samuiensis was first picked in soil containing mixtures of sand and clay west of the village of Ban Hua Thanon, in Koh Samui. Since then it is now known to occur in Ranong Province in Thailand and also at Angkor Wat in Siem Riap, Kampuchea; and verified by Gaston Guzman. It grows scattered to gregarious in rice paddies, fruiting from early July to late August.

Arranging the wedding A traditional wedding is arranged by Ghotoks (matchmakers), who are generally friends or relatives of the couple. The matchmakers facilitate the introduction among the family and the prospective bride and groom. Bangladeshi Hindu groom Bangladeshi Hindu bride Bengali weddings are traditionally in four parts: the bride's Gaye Holud, the groom's Gaye Holud, the Beeye and the Bou Bhaat. These often take place on separate days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a ring marking the \\"engagement\\", a system which is gaining popularity. This can sometimes be considered as Ashirwaad. There can be subtle differences in Bengali Hindu marriages in West Bengal and Bangladesh. The rituals sometimes differ. In Paaka Katha (final talk), the parents of the bride/groom, along with one or two very close relatives/friends go to the other party's house to formally settle the marriage. It may be followed by a lunch / dinner. A Bengali Hindu Marriage can be divided into the following parts: * Pre-wedding rituals: Adan Pradan, Patri Patra, Ashirvad, Aai Budo Bhaat, Ananda nadu, Vridhi, Dodhi Mangal, Holud Kota, Adhibas Tatva, Kubi Patta, Snan, Sankha Porano * Wedding rituals: Bor Boron, Potto Bastra, Saat Paak, Mala Badal, Subho Drishti, Sampradan, Yagna, Saat Pak (couple), Anjali, Sindur Daan and Ghomta * Post-wedding rituals: Bashar Ghar, Bashi Biye, Bidaye, Bou Boron, Kaal Ratri, Bou Bhaat, Phool Sajja, Dwiragaman Pre-wedding rituals Ashirbaad ‚Äì On an auspicious day the elders of the groom's side go to bless the bride and vice versa, by sprinkling husked rice and trefoil on their heads and giving them gold ornaments. It is a kind of acceptance of the boy and the girl on both sides. Gaye Holud ‚Äì A ceremony in which five or seven married women of the household grind turmeric with mortar and pestle and anoint the bride with turmeric paste, first it is been applied on groom then the same paste will sent to bride's home for applying it on her along with a new saree and gamchha (bengalee cotton towel) and other treassaud set from the boy's party. This brightens up the bride's complexion and makes her skin glow. Dodhi Mongol ‚Äì At dawn on the day of marriage seven married ladies adorn the bride's hands with the traditional bangles Shakha and Paula ‚Äì one pair of red and one pair of white conch-shell bangles, and feed her a meal of curd and rice, nowadays other dishes as well, the only meal after which the bride and her parents fast the whole day. This ritual is celebrated on groom's side also. Main wedding rituals  Topor Bor Jatri ‚Äì The members of the groom's house as well as his friends dress in their best attire and journey to the bride's house where the wedding takes place. Bor Boron ‚Äì When the bor jatri reaches the bride's place, usually the mother of the bride along with other members come out to welcome the groom and his family by showing the holy earthen lamp, sprinkling trefoil, and husked rice placed on a bamboo winnow (kula). Then they are served sweets and drinks. Potto Bastra ‚Äì After the groom is seated at the chadnatolla (wedding altar and canopy) ‚Äì the sanctum sanctorum where only the groom, bride and the priest takes their place, the groom is offered new clothes by the person who is to do the sampradaan ‚Äì the elderly male member of the family who does sampradaan offers the responsibility of the bride to the groom. Saat Paak ‚Äì The bride, usually seated on a low wooden stool called pidi is lifted by her brothers and is taken round the groom in seven complete circles. The significance is they are winded up securely to each other. Subho Dristi ‚Äì After saat paak the bride and the groom are made to look at each other in front of all the assembled invitees. The bride is told to remove the paan leaves. This exchange of loving glance is to initiate them to be together officially by the society. Mala Badal ‚Äì After the circles are completed, still sitting high on the piri, the bride and the groom exchange garlands of fragrant flowers thrice. This is the first step in which they accept each other. Sampradan ‚Äì The bride then takes her place at the chadnatolla where an elderly male member of the bride's family hands her over to the groom and the couple's hands are bound by the sacred thread amidst recital of Vedic chants and are placed on the mangal ghot ‚Äì a brass pitcher filled with water that is covered with mango leaves attached to one twig and a green coconut placed on it. Yagna ‚Äì The bride and groom sit in front of the sacred fire and chant mantras after the priest. Agni, the fire god is made the divine witness to the marriage. See Vedic marriage. Saptapadi ‚Äì The saptapadi in Bengali wedding is quite different from what is popular (\\"phere\\") in many other parts of India. There are seven betel leaves laid out in a sequence. The bride steps on these leaves one by one followed by the groom. The groom moves a special stone \\"nora\\" (typically used for crushing and pasting spices) with his foot as they move forward. Anjali ‚Äì An offering to the fire is made. The bride's brother puts puffed rice (khoi) in the hands of the bride, and the groom standing close to her holds her hands from the back and extends their arms forward. They then pour the offering into the fire together. Sindoor Daan and Ghomta ‚Äì Once again seated at their respective places in chadnatolla the groom applies sindoor or vermilion (a symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women thereafter) on the bride's hair-parting. During the process of sindoor daan the bride's head is covered with a new saree given by the groom's family. This is known as \\"lojja bostro\\". Fish as a gift in Bengali wedding: In Bengali weddings, the gifts are specially wrapped before sending them to the household of the bride and groom. However, such gifts have special motifs and fish is one of them. Post-wedding rituals alta. Bidaay ‚Äì This is a farewell ‚Äì mixed moment of joy and sorrow as the bride is bid adieu with blessings of her parents and relatives to start a new life with her beau. The bride has to throw rice in the sari of her mother to fill the responsibility of her mother to her (as it is considered that the bride is the Groom's responsibility). Bodhu Boron - This is done when the bride reaches the groom's house. One dish is made full with alta and milk. The bride stands on it, then enters the room with groom after being welcomed by the mother-in-law. Kaal Ratri ‚Äì After the couple reaches the groom's house and the initial welcome ceremony is over they are separated for the night, probably to get a refreshing sleep and prepare for the next day's final wedding ceremony. Bou Bhaat ‚Äì The bride cooks and serves all the members of her husband's family. The husband has to gift a sari to new bride and has to take a vow of taking the responsibility of the bride's basic needs (\\"Bhaat Kapor\\" - literally meaning food & dress). A banquet is held to treat the guests who lavish gifts on the new bride. Phool Shojja ‚Äì The couple and their bed are adorned with flowers and are left together in their room to enjoy conjugal bliss. There are friends who actually stay under the bed or by the corner of the door, the groom needs to check for these devils before he begins to talk to the bride. Arranging a wedding Arranging a wedding is a relatively complex affair with many moving parts. Even a simple wedding requires 5‚Äì8 vendors and 300‚Äì500 guests. To simplify the process, there are event management companies that help in executing the process. Selection of food menu for the dinner party on the occasion of Bengali wedding ceremony is very critical aspect of successfully arranging a wedding.

The definition of a completed innings would be if all ten batsmen have been dismissed or the pre-determined number of overs have been completed. It is rare for first-class matches to end in ties and, in more than 200 years of first-class cricket, it has happened on just 65 occasions, two of those in Test matches. The earliest known instance of a tie is in a single wicket \\"threes\\" match at Lamb's Conduit Field on Wednesday, 1 September 1736. Three London players were matched against three of Surrey. Although the sources give different totals for each innings, they are agreed that both teams totalled 23 overall. London batted first and scored either 4 and 19, or 3 and 18. Surrey replied with either 18 and 5, or 17 and 6.Buckley, FL18C, p. 13.Bowen, p. 263.Maun, p. 81. Five years later, the same two teams produced the earliest known tie in an eleven-a-side match. The first tie in a match later given first-class cricket status was in 1783 between a Hampshire XI and a Kent XI.Hampshire XI v Kent XI, scorecard, CricInfo. Retrieved 2019-04-05. A tie was previously sometimes declared where the scores were level when scheduled play ended, but the side batting last still had wickets in hand. In 1948, the rules were changed so that when this occurs the match is declared a draw. This happened in a Test between England and Zimbabwe in 1996. England needed 205 to win the match in their fourth innings, off 37 overs, but finished the day 204/6. With three runs required off the last ball, Nick Knight was run-out going for the third, thus making it the first time in Test history that a match had finished drawn with scores level. It happened again in 2011, in a Test between India and the West Indies at Mumbai, this time with nine wickets down in the fourth innings. Below is a list of all first-class matches that have been declared tied, including those before 1948 which would have been draws in the modern era.

It was created in 1963 by the British choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton specifically for Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. The ballet takes its inspiration from the 1848 novel La Dame aux Cam√©lias by Alexandre Dumas, fils, and other adaptations of the same story such as Giuseppe Verdi's 1853 opera La traviata. Plot Marguerite Gautier, a Parisian courtesan, lies on her deathbed, gravely ill with tuberculosis. In her delirium she recalls her love affair with a young man named Armand, which the ballet portrays using many dreamlike flashback sequences. In the first flashback, Marguerite, wearing a red dress, is surrounded by admirers and suitors. She lets them flirt with her, but feels no real emotions. Armand enters and falls for Marguerite immediately, and she returns his feelings. At the end of this sequence, Marguerite tests Armand's love by throwing a white flower to the ground as her wealthy protector leads her away. Another suitor goes to pick up the flower, but when Armand moves to take it, the other man lets him. This symbolizes Marguerite and Armand as a couple. Marguerite, now increasingly ill, deserts her wealthy protector to live in the countryside with Armand. However, Armand's father asks her to quit her lover; she agrees, but will not tell Armand why she must leave him. A despairing Marguerite is about to leave the country house when Armand enters, and becomes distressed upon seeing her so distraught. A passionate sequence follows, portraying the characters' love, Marguerite's sacrifice and Armand's confusion. Armand, angered by Marguerite's lack of an explanation, publicly humiliates her by tearing the necklace given to her by her wealthy protector from her neck and throwing it to the floor, and throwing money in her face. In the final scenes, sad and alone, Marguerite waits for inevitable death. However, Armand's father has revealed the truth to him and Armand makes it back to the apartment to hold Marguerite one last time. She dies in his arms. Dancers The ballet was particularly associated with Nureyev and Fonteyn, the original performers. It featured in their farewell performances in Fonteyn & Nureyev on Broadway. Revivals of the ballet have starred pairings such as Sylvie Guillem and Nicolas Le Riche, Zenaida Yanowsky and Roberto Bolle, and Tamara Rojo and Sergei Polunin.\\"Marguerite and Armand: 20 October 2011\\", Royal Opera House performance database.

In November 2015, the ballet was performed for the first time by The Sarasota Ballet, which marked the first time an American ballet company had been given permission to perform this iconic Ashton ballet. The piece was performed in a triple bill alongside Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto and Peter Wright's Summertide. The leading roles of Marguerite and Armand were performed by Principals Victoria Hulland and Ricardo Graziano and subsequently during the matinee performance by Danielle Brown and Juan Gil. Hulland and Graziano would become the first American woman and Brazilian man to perform these roles.Reichert, Nick \\"All About Ashton: Sarasota Ballet makes American dance history\\", Sarasota Observer, 11 November 2015 Music From 1963 to 1968 the ballet was danced to an orchestration of Liszt's sonata by Humphrey Searle.

Hyponitrite ion Hyponitrite exhibits cis‚Äìtrans isomerism.Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier The trans (E) form is generally found in hyponitrite salts such as sodium hyponitrite () and silver(I) hyponitrite (). The cis (Z) form of sodium hyponitrite can be obtained too, and it is more reactive than the trans form. The cis hyponitrite anion is nearly planar and almost symmetric, with lengths of about 140 pm for N‚àíO bond and 120 pm for the N‚àíN bond, and O‚àíN‚àíN angles of about 119¬∞.Claus Feldmann, Martin Jansen (1996), \\"cis-Sodium Hyponitrite ‚Äì A New Preparative Route and a Crystal Structure Analysis\\".

Life  In 1840, he set himself up at Saint-√âtienne, where he was professor at the town's university. He left the town for Lyon in 1845 where he became a professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, becoming its director in 1874 and teaching artists including L√©on-Alexandre Delhomme. In 1852 he produced the Virgin on top of the chapel of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re in his studio on the quays of the Sa√¥ne. When his studio was flooded, the statue's unveiling was put back to 8 December, which has since then been celebrated as Lyon's f√™te des lumi√®res. From 15 to 19 September 1863, he was in Lourdes to visit Bernadette Soubirous, who described to him the visions of the Virgin Mary. He then made a statue of the Virgin, commissioned by the Lacour sisters and under the control of Abbot Blanc, who above all wanted a statue faithful to the young woman's description.

It is only known from the coastal regions of Israel, but is probably an alien species, as its food plant is not native to Israel. The species was discovered in 2005 and is named for the entomologist and sculptor Yosef Schlein. The larvae only feed on Ricinus communis, which is curious because this plants produces the natural insecticide ricin. According to the author, the species is in fact a biblical moth species mentioned in the Book of Jonah, in which there is a description of a worm that, nightly, infested a kikayon (Ricinus) plant, and caused it to wither. The larvae of the recently described Olepa schleini are the only insects which regularly infest Ricinus communis in Israel and adjacent countries. The aggregation of larvae on particular trees, with the unusual feeding that includes the stems, causes massive damage and withering of this plant.\\"Olepa schleini: Wiederentdeckung eines biblischen Schmetterlings aus dem Buch Jona\\"  References  Category:Spilosomina Category:Moths described in 2005 Category:Moths of the Middle East Category:Endemic fauna of Israel ","title":"Olepa schleini"},{"id":"20323907","text":"Jankulovski () is a Macedonian surname.

Until the French Revolution, it was the church of Lyon Charterhouse (chartreuse de Lyon). The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Bruno of Cologne, also known as Saint Bruno of the Carthusians, and is the city's only Baroque church. History Lyon and the Carthusians At the end of the 16th century, the royalty and clergy of France, inspired by the Counter-Reformation, set out on the revival of Roman Catholicism by creating new monasteries and enlarging existing ones. In consequence, the hill of La Croix-Rousse regained the religious use it had in antiquity: from 1584 and over the following century, thirteen religious communities were established on it, giving it the nickname of the \\"hill that prays\\" (la colline qui prie), which was later transferred to the other major hill in Lyon, la Fourvi√®re. The first monastic communities here were established by Carthusian monks from Grenoble, thanks to their good relations with the church in Lyon. They initially came to help the clergy of Lyon when the city was pillaged by Forez Guy in the 12th century and later obtained privileges such as an exemption from tolls on their journeys to Lyon. On a visit by King Henri III in August 1584, however, two Carthusian monks were presented to request him to grant his consent to the foundation of a Carthusian monastery in Lyon. They were successful, and the king also pledged 30,000 livres for its construction (though he never paid them) and chose its name: Chartreuse du Lys St Esprit. In 1589, Henri III died and was succeeded by Henri IV, who declared himself the founder of the Carthusian monastery and confirmed its exemptions and privileges, which were reconfirmed by Louis XIII and Louis XIV. The Carthusians began by acquiring the Girofl√©e estate on the banks of the Sa√¥ne, then extended their lands by purchasing those of their neighbours little by little, until they had a total property of 24 hectares. Contrary to what might be supposed, their extension of their property bore no relation to an expansion in their numbers (they remained at only 28 monks). Instead they related the expansion of their estate to their monastic rule: they were eliminating all their neighbours so as better to live their life of solitary contemplation. Construction of the church It took six years after the king's gift for the first stone of the church to be laid. Its construction was carried out in two phases: the first (1590-1690) included the choir, the small cloister, the sacristy and a few of the monks' cells; the second (in the 18th century) involved the completion of the nave, the transept and the side chapels. Finally, renovations and extensions occurred during the 19th century, mainly affecting the chapels and fa√ßade. Description  Choir  Choir The choir now has only 5 windows, after several were blocked up during the second phase of works by the architect Ferdinand-Sigismond Delamonce in 1733-37. The Rococo stalls found here show reversed volutes and garlands of foliage as well as asymmetrical shells and garlands of flowers. Typical of the 17th century Baroque style, the 1628 statues now located on the pilasters of the Munet arch were originally in the choir. They are by Sarazin and represent Saint Bruno of Cologne and Saint John the Baptist. The drapery of these figures is dynamically carved, and their thin faces and tense eyes add to their pathetic expressions. Today the church organ is also located in the choir, but the church has only had one since 1890, when it became a parish church. It is now known as the best of the double keyboards in Lyon. Before 1890 the austerity of the Carthusian Rule made for an austere liturgy unadorned by organ music. Virgin of the Carthusians, by Joseph-Hugues Fabisch, official sculptor to the Diocese of Lyon The offices were celebrated in the choir until 1737, when it was separated from the rest of the church for building works by a partition. In the initial plan by the architect Delamonce for his second phase of works, the choir remained separated from the rest of the church but the abbot refused to authorise this plan, and so a second was drawn up and accepted that kept the choir as part of the church. =Pulpit= Built to hold the book of liturgical chants, the pulpit is in the shape of a spread-eagle (symbol of the Word of God) supported by a column carved with the Eucharistic symbols of grapes and vines, and rooted in a base with the figure of a dove (symbol of the Holy Spirit). It thus unites the three persons of the Holy Trinity.  Transept and crossing  The Munet arch between the choir and the crossing The baldachino by Servandoni =Munet arch= The transition between the choir and the crossing is formed by the Munet arch, built by the architect Melchior Muneta pupil of Soufflot in the 18th century. It is supported by powerful deflecting pillars in the Baroque style. Here there are also two nested pilasters of the Doric Order, whose niches are now occupied by the Sarazin statues. =Altar= Designed in the 18th century by Servandoni then modified very soon afterwards by Soufflot (known for his work at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Lyon and the Panth√©on de Paris), the altar is notable for being two-sided, meaning that the office could equally well be celebrated from the monks' side or from the peoples' side. The tabernacle (i.e., the small cabinet holding the consecrated wafers) was originally decorated with semi-precious stones, but these disappeared during the Revolution. =Baldachino= The 18th century baldachino is also by Servandoni. One of the most beautiful examples in France, it aims to magnify the presence of Christ in the Eucharist and in effect to form a hyper- tabernacle around the Host. Its columns are of marble, whilst the capitals are wooden but stuccoed with powdered marble, limestone and powdered chalk to imitate marble. On top of the baldachino are a globe and a cross, both in copper gilded with gold leaf, and drapery made of cloth dipped in liquid plaster and painted gold before drying. The original decoration is unclear: it was long thought that it had been covered in fleurs de lys, which were turned into trefoils, or clover leaves, during the 19th-century renovations. However, more recent renovations found that even before the 19th century the stemless trefoils were there. =Dome= The crossing dome is made up of 8 oval windows 5m high, separated by vaulting and crowned with polygonal decoration. It also has 4 pendentives whose decoration is inspired by the theme of the Four Evangelists.Saint Luke with his bull and Saint John the Evangelist with his eagle on the nave side; Saint Matthew with his angel and Saint Mark with his lion on the choir side.  Nave  Interior looking east along the nave towards the choir The decoration of this area contrasts slightly with the rest of the church, being more sober and thus more in keeping with the Carthusian spirit. It was finished in the 18th century. Its ceiling is decorated with arched vaults and the transition between the walls and ceiling is via a dentellated cornice around the whole church (it was extended round the choir in the 18th century). Under this cornice is a frieze whose metopes alternate between a rose and a dove (the latter symbolising the Holy Spirit and thus the Carthusians). On either side of the nave are 4 arcades opening onto side chapels, separated from each other by Doric columns. =Side chapels= Renovations in the 19th century modified (among other things) the interiors of the eight side chapels. Their altars were effectively reorientated to face the exterior walls rather than the east end, and the windows lighting each chapel were blocked (though traces of them can still be seen on the outside of the nave walls).  West front  West front Before 1870, the west front was very sober, and consisted of a flat wall pierced only by a window and a door. When the monastic church became a parish church, Louis-Jean Sainte-Marie Perrin was commissioned to make a new plan for the fa√ßade, which he designed to consist of three receding levels, centred symmetrically. The first of these is the church's entrance porch, bordered by Ionic columns and Doric pilasters. Below the entrance door is a Latin inscription from the Gospel of St Matthew, referring to the subscription among the canutsthe silk weavers of Lyon to finance the works on the fa√ßade: \\"Come to me, all you who are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\\". The second level is a curvilinear balcony with a small terrace, above which is the window (the only surviving element of the original west front) surrounded by four fluted columns and a triangular pediment with the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The third level contains a niche with a statue of Saint Bruno between the initials S. B.  Dome  On the dome are 8 bays, each with one of the 8 interior windows below it. The dome's exterior is made of stone and serves to hide the internal structure of the dome far below it. On top of it is a lantern surmounted by a cross on a globe in lead, symbol of the Carthusians. In all the dome measures 10m high and 39m in circumference.

It is part of the Groupe Galeries Lafayette and served by the Metro station H√¥tel de Ville. It occupies four other smaller specialized stores, in the neighborhood, and has also opened several other shops in France and in Beirut, Lebanon. BHV currently operates several stores in the Paris metropolitan area and two in the Lyon metropolitan area. The store slogan is \\"Style as lifestyle\\" (\\"Style comme style de vie\\")  History and evolution Xavier Ruel, an engineer, and his wife moved to Paris in 1852. Ruel was selling small items through street vendors and realized that the most effective neighborhood was the one around the H√¥tel de Ville (City Hall). Therefore, he rented the ground floor of a building to open a boutique, in this neighborhood, which he called, the ‚ÄúBazar Parisien‚Äù. According to the legend, in 1855, Ruel saved Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eug√©nie, whose horses became frightened while passing in front of his store. To reward him, she gave him a sum of money which, enabled him to expand his store, in 1856, which he renamed ‚ÄúBazar Napol√©on‚Äù to show his gratitude to the Emperor and his wife. In 1866, thanks to his successful business, he was able to rent three floors of this same building, on 54 rue de Rivoli. In 1870, his store occupied the whole building. In 1871, due to the fall of the Empire, Ruel changed the name of the store by ‚ÄúBazar de l'H√¥tel de Ville‚Äù which refers to the H√¥tel de Ville, located across the street. Xavier Ruel was also involved in the political and social life of Paris. He was elected city councillor several times and in 1893, was made Knight of the Legion of Honour. He was 78 years old when he died in 1900. He left behind a business who employed 800 people. His company, then named ‚ÄúSoci√©t√© Veuve Ruel et Compagnie‚Äù recorded a capital of twelve millions francs. The BHV, like other department stores born in this time, were innovative since they offered fixed price and sometimes, promotions to attract the customers. They also invested in advertisement which was a new aspect of trade. Advertisement for the Bazar de l'H√¥tel de Ville published in the magazine L'≈íuvre d'art in Paris, in 1895 The store underwent several some renovations in 1903-04 and in 1913, a new building was built with its famous rotunda, by the architect Auguste Roy. After the World War I, consumption exploded among all social classes and the BHV, like other department stores benefited from this phenomenon and targeted new customers, the middle class. With the development of domestic appliances, in the 1920s, the BHV opened a new department which attracted numerous housewives. This department has kept growing since then. During the World War II, the BHV faced difficulties in its resupplying. In August 1944, the BHV, due to its location, was able to witness the liberation of Paris and the end of the war. In 1963, the company opens its first branch store. Over time, several other BHV department stores are opened in Paris region but most of them are closed nowadays. In 1991, the BHV is bought by the Galeries Lafayette group. On 2 December 1978, a bombing at the place killed one person and injured 25 others.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/world/25-wounded-by-bombs- at-2-paris-department-stores.html In 2007-2008, the BHV expands its store with new specialized stores, in the same neighborhood. In 2012, the store management announced further modifications to its structure, with renovation on each floor, to give a renewal aspect to the store. Paul Delaoutre, CEO of the branch department stores of the Galeries Lafayette group explained that they ‚Äúaimed at targeting creative urban inhabitants looking for originality‚Äù. This is the reason why they decided to ‚Äúreinvent‚Äù the BHV. This also implied a new name which is no longer the BHV but the BHV Marais and a new logo.

The Second Boer War was fought from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902, between the British Empire and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic). It was a lengthy war involving large numbers of troops which ended with the conversion of the Boer republics into British colonies, with a promise of limited self-government. These colonies later formed part of the Union of South Africa. During the Boer war, 22,000 troops were treated for wounds inflicted during battle.. The surgical facilities provided by the British Army were vastly more effective than in previous campaigns.. The Medical Department of the army mobilised 151 staff and regimental units.. Twenty eight field ambulances, five stationary hospitals and 16 general hospitals were established to deal with casualties. Numerous voluntary organizations set up additional hospitals, medical units and first aid posts. Around one thousand Indians from Natal were shipped to South Africa to help in the recovery effort by transporting the wounded off the battlefields. Even Mahatma Gandhi, who was practising as a lawyer at the time in Durban, was a volunteer, helping recovery efforts in the Battles of Colenso and Spionkop.. A second unit was established by Johannesburg and Cape Town Jews and aided both armies. Implications in recovery British soldiers lie dead on the battlefield after the Battle of Spion Kop, 24 Jan 1900 A British soldier wounded by a Boer Mauser bullet During the early weeks of the war, the Boers were reported to be using poisoned bullets which worsened the infection of British soldier wounds.. Although the rifles used in the war were not intended to inflict massive damage, the Boers used German Mauser rifles which were known for creating clean wounds. However the bullets they used, known commonly as \\"Dum-dums\\" - also used by the British - were made from a soft lead which would expand upon impact or were modified by cutting through the outer case of a normal bullet to affect the way the opposing army was wounded. Boer bullets retrieved from wounded soldiers in the battlefields were often found to contain a green fat coating, which had been used to lubricate the chamber and rifle barrel. Recovery paramedics in the Boer War However, many wounded in battle that survived, described the wounds inflicted by the Boers as painless initially but would increase in pain gradually. Many described the experience as being \\"tapped with a hammer\\" or \\"being less painful than the drawing of a tooth\\".. However, many suffered considerably. One British Sergeant shot during the Siege of Ladysmith described the wounding as follows: Surgical developments and treatment A surgeon operating during the Boer War Of the 22,000 that were treated for wounds during the Second Boer War, the majority survived, largely due to the efficiency of the medical teams which cared for the affected. The Royal Army Medical Corps, which had formed after the redunduncies of the Crimean War, played a key role in the treatment of the wounded in the Boer War. The salaries of medical corps soldiers had gradually increased and training improved, improving the system and quality of the medical services.. Surgery had made considerable advancement in the late nineteenth century, and the army surgery facilities were considered state of the art at the time. In 1899 the RAMC had recruited a number of specialist surgeons in its ranks to treat the wounded, including many of notable prestige, including Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet, Sir William Cheyne, 1st Baronet, Sir William MacCormac, 1st Baronet, William Stokes, Kendal Franks and G.L. Cheatle. George Henry Makins, a prominent surgeon during the Boer War published a textbook of military surgery in 1901. A treatment tent in the Boer War Casualties during the Boer War were generally recovered in stages. Battalion doctors located on the battlefields would take the wounded by stretcher to a dressing station for initial treatment. This included the widespread use of field dressings consisting of a sterile gauze pad stitched to the bandage and covered with waterproofing. Each pack contained two dressings and numerous safety pins. Later they would be taken to ambulances or stationary hospitals where the complex recovery by the surgeons could be carried out. However, given the number of casualties in relation to staff, it was often days before a wounded soldier could see a doctor for full treatment, increasing the extent of the infection of the wounds.. As a result, primary surgical care was often conducted in ambulances. Many wounds were open fractures and often involved damage to bones. In such cases, the wounds were treated by debridement and the wound packed.. The limb would then be immobilised with a splint made of canvas with strips of bamboo sewn in to support it.Plaster of Paris was also used during the Boer War after the bone had been set. The treatment of wounds was greatly enhanced by the invention of X-rays and some 9 machines were taken to South Africa during the campaign. Soldiers treated for head wounds inflicted during battle There was also some success with the treatment of head injuries.. However, the medical operations in the Boer War were considerably less successful in treating wounds inflicted in the chest. Conducting abdominal surgery at the side of the battefields was often ineffective given the seriousness of the location of the bullet wound and the limited facilities in the temporary tents for treating such advanced complications. Deaths from chest wounds were of a far greater number than other wounds.. Some atrocities towards wounded Boer soldiers which fell into British hands have been reported. Extracts from British soldiers and generals private letters and documents have revealed some evidence of inhumane activity by the British in encountering the wounded enemy.

In June 1841, Balzac wrote again to Mme Hanska: \\"I have just finished M√©moires de deux jeunes mari√©es\\".Lettres √† Madame Hanska, Volume I, 534. The manuscript to which this letter refers is no longer extant. On 10 November 1841, Balzac's editor Hippolyte Souverain authorized the serialization of the novel in the French journal La Presse. The editor of the journal, however, bowdlerized Balzac's text. Between 26 November and 6 December 1841 letters I through XXV, which comprised part one of the novel, were serialized. Part two (letters XXVI through XLVII) and part three (letters XLVIII through LIX) were serialized between then and 1 January 1842. The serialization had neither a foreword nor a dedication. The first Furne edition, which faithfully reproduced Balzac's original text, appeared in two volumes in January 1842. This edition included a foreword (dated \\"Les Jardies, May 1840\\"Les Jardies was Balzac's estate in S√®vres) and a dedication to George Sand. The original division of the novel into three parts was retained. The second edition appeared on 3 September 1842 as part of Furne's publication of La Com√©die humaine. Letters of Two Brides was the first book in the second volume of the series, Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e(Scenes from Private Life), followed by A Daughter of Eve. For this edition Balzac removed the foreword and divided the novel into two parts. He also altered the date of the foreword to \\"Paris, 1841\\". There exists a final revision of the text in Balzac's own hand in the Lovenjoul Collection.Collection Lovenjoul: Ms Lov. A 18. In this revision Canalis replaces M. de Saint-H√©reen, and the dates of letters XLVIII, XLIX and LI have been altered. The fragmentary S≈ìur Marie des Anges was to form part of the series of works known as Sc√®nes de la vie parisienne (Scenes from Parisian Life). However, this fragment has little in common with Letters of Two Brides; it is not in epistolary form and its plot is quite different. Its relation to the later novel has still not been satisfactorily explained.Roger Pierrot, Album de la Pl√©iade, Volume 12, p.339. A character called M√®re Marie des Anges, the superior of the Ursuline convent at Arcis-sur-Aube, appears in another of Balzac's novels, The Member for Arcis, as do a number of characters from Letters of Two Brides. Plot The story concerns two young French women, Louise de Chaulieu (1805‚Äì1835) and Ren√©e de Maucombe (born 1807), who become close friends during their novitiate at the Carmelite convent of Blois. When they leave the convent, however, their lives follow two very different paths. Louise chooses a life of romance, whereas Ren√©e takes a much more pragmatic approach; but their friendship is preserved through their correspondence, which continues for a dozen years from 1823 through 1835. Louise is expected to sacrifice herself for her two brothers and take the veil, but the young girl refuses to submit to such a fate. Her dying grandmother intercedes on her behalf and bequeaths her her fortune, thereby rescuing her from the enclosed life of a Carmelite nun and leaving her financially independent. Free to assist her brothers financially without having to sacrifice her own ambitions, Louise settles in Paris and throws herself into a life of Italian operas, masqued balls and romantic intrigues. She falls in love with an unbecoming but noble Spaniard, Felipe H√©narez, Baron de Macumer. Banished from Spain, he lives incognito in Paris where he is forced to support himself by teaching Spanish. When he regains his fortune and noble standing, he woos Louise with a romantic fervour that finally wins her over. The pair are married in March 1825. They live a life of carefree happiness, but Louise's jealousy embitters him and leads to his physical break-down. He dies in 1829, leaving a grieving widow of twenty-four. Ren√©e de Maucombe's attitude to love and life are in marked contrast to those of Louise. When she leaves the convent at Blois Ren√©e moves to Provence, where she marries an older man of little wealth or standing whom she can hardly be said to love. She bears Louis de L'Estorade three children, and over the course of the next decade she devotes herself body and soul to the happiness of her family. Gradually she grows to love her husband in her own way, and with her encouragement he makes a career for himself in local politics, which culminates in his becoming a peer of France and a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. During this time Ren√©e is quite scathing in her criticisms of Louise, whom she sees as a selfish and self-indulgent coquette. True happiness for a woman lies in motherhood and devotion to her family. Meanwhile, four years after the death of Felipe, Louise falls in love again. This time the object of her love is a poor poet and playwright Marie Gaston, who is several years younger than she is. As though taking a leaf out of Ren√©e's book, Louise sells her Parisian property, moves to a chalet in Ville-d'Avray (a small village near Paris) and lives a life of seclusion with her new husband. But Ren√©e is not fooled by this masquerade. Louise, she warns, is still living a life devoted to selfishness and self-indulgence, while true happiness lies only in self-sacrifice to one's husband and children - Louise remains childless. After a few years of apparent bliss, Louise detects a change in her husband. He becomes solicitous about the financial success of his plays, and a large sum of money goes missing. Suspecting him of having an expensive mistress, Louise makes enquiries and comes to the shocking conclusion that he has another family in Paris ‚Äì an Englishwoman known by the name Madame Gaston, and two children, who look remarkably like Marie. Louise confides her feelings of despair to Ren√©e and announces her determination to commit suicide rather than to submit to such a fate. Ren√©e's husband makes enquiries and discovers the truth of the situation. Madame Gaston is the widow of Marie's brother. The death of her husband has left her financially destitute and Marie has taken it upon himself to assist her and his two nephews, but he is ashamed to ask his wife for money. Rene√© writes to Louise to inform her of the truth and rushes to the chalet, but she is too late. Louise has contracted consumption by lying out in the dew overnight and she dies a few days later.

The village spreads over a small hill having around 200 houses. The village comes under the Tarakeshwar Municipality. The main occupation of people of this village is farming. The village is moving forward along with the Kathmandu city towards the advancement and development though both of them are struggling hard for it. Nefore 1990, the village was under the black shadow of poverty and lack of education. The village had a small primary school named \\"Jitpur Prathamik Vidyalaya\\" at the center of the village. The school with a ramshackle old building sans furniture served the purpose of educating the whole village. The school kids had to use hay mats. The school sans proper protection from rain and gale used to close during extreme weathers. The percentage of educated people was very less and girl education was out of question. The village was sans healthy drinking water, toilet, electricity and roads. But now the village has metamorphosed. There is a pair of two big buildings at the heart of the village labeled \\"Jitpur higher secondary school\\". There is a serpentine road stretch covering the whole area of the village. A playground is visible from distance. Every evening, young lads are seen playing football and volleyball on the ground. A club is also there where there is a small library where few people are digging deep into the books and few are pondering on chessboard. Few vehicles are seen parked at the side of the playground. The villagers do not have to rummage in the dark nights anymore as electricity has been availed for them. Few houses at the side of the road are seen to have motorbikes. Patches of few pucka cemented houses seem to protrude out of the clay houses. The school is having more girl students than boys. During weekdays morning, few people are seen in formals waiting at the bus stand to go to office. Not only Electricity poles but TV antennas and wireless telephone antennas are also seen rampant in the village. During the festival seasons, the evenings are fraught with cultural programs at the school playground. The well-lit ambit and well-equipped stages are not difficult things to achieve anymore. The village has recently got High school in its own effort and contribution from the villagers. A private English boarding school has also been established to serve the purpose of the nouveau-riche. During festivals the village organizes different sports tournaments inviting the nearby villages and schools. People have started adopting new professions as well. Few families has starting poultry farm as their new side profession which they can handle along with the farming without any extra manpower. Many shops has opened at the side of the road. People have started sending their children out of village for higher education. Although few in number, there are people with master's degree and Engineers. People from nearby villages are jealous of the progress and unity of this village. The whole credit for the present good status of the village and the smiles at the villagers' face solely goes to \\"The Plan International\\", an NGO. The NGO started its operation in this village in 1989. It started helping poor families by adopting girl children and admitting them in a good school (inside or outside the country). The choose few girl children from the impoverished families with many children. The next great thing initiated by PLAN was building simple toilets and providing healthy drinking water for the villagers. For this purpose, the PLAN gathered villagers and motivated them to contribute labor or money or resource whichever possible. The village got a road in 1990 and first school building in 1992. The school changed its building and started incrementing the standard by 1 standard every year. In 1997, the school became a secondary school. In 1998, the school added one more building to accommodate the increasing number of students. The standard of education in the school kept on improving and in 2001 in started higher education in Arts and Commerce streams. The slippery narrow walking ways of village have been replaced by concrete steps and wider paths. The sinuous concrete stepped path bifurcates the green fields of the village. The villagers with load on their back no more stagger to maintain their balance during the rainy season. Small kids are seen walking to and from the playground and home without holding their guardians fingers. Apart from these, the village has recently got Cable TV connection. People have started using mobile phones and computers. more and more people are choosing to do new. The sprawling green field and swards just below the village has got a long stretch of road which has shortened its distance to 5 km from the Kathmandu city. But, the life in this village is not as rosy as you are thinking. One tragedy is that the road has been there in the initial stage for more than 6 years, but it never got that black layer on it. The electricity seems to be a rare guest to the villages as load shedding has increased from 12 hours to 16 hours. The present not so good state of village depicts that few not so good politicians seem to have duped the not so clever villagers to win their votes and seem to have forgotten the village until the next election. The concrete steps seem to be struggling to maintain their existence as half of it has been covered by mud and weeds. Let there be more light and more Education. Let the villagers be justly treated. Let Kisandol be back to its pristine glory and beauty.

In the United Kingdom, this extends to matters affecting the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall; for the latter, Prince's Consent must also be obtained.Queen's or Prince's Consent The Scottish Parliament adheres to the same requirement of consent.Rule 9.11 of the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament Bills affected Bills affecting the royal prerogative and the personal property and \\"personal interests\\" of the monarch require Queen's Consent. In Canada, no act of parliament binds the monarch or his or her rights unless the act states that it does so. Queen's Consent (or Royal Consent) is typically granted by the governor general on behalf of the sovereign and specially communicated to parliament. Typically, though, it is expressed by a minister of the Canadian Crown. In the United Kingdom, as well as bills that affect the prerogative, bills affecting the hereditary revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Duchy of Cornwall require Queen's Consent. Bills affecting the latter also require Prince's Consent from the Prince of Wales in his capacity as Duke of Cornwall. In certain circumstances, such as for the House of Lords Act 1999, the consent of the Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Earl of Chester or Prince and Great Steward of Scotland, must also be obtained where a bill affects his interests.House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 30 Apr 1996 (pt 1)Prince's Consent asked on 12 bills, Oxford Times In 1993, both Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent were required in respect of the Priests (Ordination of Women) Measure 1993 that enabled the ordination of women in the Church of England.I hope that I need detain the House...: 29 Oct 1993: House of Commons debates - TheyWorkForYou The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has produced guidance on the need for Queen's or Prince's Consent and the procedures associated with them. Effect on parliamentary proceedings Consent is usually signified in the one (in unicameral legislatures) or both houses (in bicameral legislatures) of parliament, at either the second or third reading, by a privy counsellor and is recorded in Hansard. Where proposed legislation is sponsored by the cabinet (as is the case for most bills considered by parliament), it is the usual practice for the relevant ministers to inform the monarch (or Prince of Wales, when necessary) well before the bill is introduced to parliament. In the Scottish parliament, consent is signified by a member of the Scottish government. In the Canadian parliament, Royal Consent can be signified in only one legislative chamber. If consent is required but not signified, a bill may make no further progress through parliament. If a bill is mistakenly allowed to progress even though the required consent was not signified and the error is discovered before royal assent has been given, the proceedings may later be declared void.e.g. Hansard HC Deb 20 July 1949 vol 467 cc1385-6 Where a bill requires the consent of the Prince and Steward of Scotland or the Duke of Rothesay, the Scottish parliament cannot debate any question whether the bill be passed or approved unless such consent to those provisions has been signified by a member of the Scottish executive. Once a bill has passed parliament and received Royal Assent, it is regarded as legally valid by the courts, regardless of any deficiency in parliamentary procedure, in accordance with the usual principles of parliamentary privilege. Consent granted or withheld on advice of the cabinet If Queen's Consent is withheld, it is, according to the tenets of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, done on the advice of ministers of the Crown. A spokesman for the Queen stated in 2013 that: \\"It is a long established convention that the Queen is asked by parliament to provide consent to those bills which parliament has decided would affect crown interests. The sovereign has not refused to consent to any bill affecting crown interests unless advised to do so by ministers.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals- veto-bills Similarly, the Prince of Wales grants and withholds the Prince's Consent on the advice of the sovereign's British ministers, as the Duchy of Cornwall is within British jurisdiction. No bill affecting the Duchy of Cornwall has been refused consent by either the sovereign or the Duke of Cornwall. Each granting of consent by the Prince of Wales is a \\"matter of public record\\".http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/faqs/why-the-prince-of-wales- asked-his-approval-various-government-bills In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II, acting on the advice of her British Cabinet, refused to signify her consent to the Parliament of the United Kingdom debating the Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill, which sought to transfer from the sovereign to parliament the power to authorize military strikes against Iraq.\\"Iraq attack bill fails\\". BBC News, 16 April 1999. Retrieved on 12 April 2007. This prevented the bill from being debated. In 1988, the Palace of Westminster (Removal of Crown Immunity) Bill could not be debated in the British parliament because Queen's Consent was withheld, as with the Reform of the House of Lords Bill in 1990. Relationship to royal assent Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are distinct from royal assent. Royal assent is granted after a bill has passed through parliament, whereas Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent, where required, are granted before parliament has debated or voted to pass a bill. Royal assent is also required for all legislation, whereas Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are only required for legislation affecting specific topics. In practice, royal assent is less frequently denied than is Queen's Consent or Prince's Consent. Royal assent forms part of the constitution and lies under the royal prerogative, while Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are internal parliamentary rules of procedure that could, in principle, be dispensed with by parliament.

The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety.\\" A constructed language (sometimes called a conlang)Artificial languages are informally called conlangs (constructed languages), and the study of artificial languages and related matters is interlinguistics. is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial languages, planned languages or invented languages and in some cases, fictional languages. Planned languages are languages that have been purposefully designed. They are the result of deliberate controlling intervention, thus of a form of language planning.Klaus Schubert, Designed Languages for Communicative Needs within and between Language Communities, in: Planned languages and language planning (PDF), Austrian National Library, 2019 There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code); to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning; for artistic creation; and for language games. Some people make constructed languages simply because they like doing it. The expression planned language is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective artificial, as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside Esperanto culture, the term language planning means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a \\"natural language\\" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. Prescriptive grammars, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between na√Øve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction. The term glossopoeia is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of artistic languages.Sarah L. Higley: Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language. Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2011 found 8397 speakers of Esperanto, and the census of 2001 found 10 of Romanid, two each of Interlingua and Ido and one each of Idiom Neutral and Mundolinco. The Russian census of 2010 found that there were in Russia about 992 speakers of Esperanto (on place 120), nine of Ido, one of Edo, and none of Slovio or Interlingua. Planned, constructed, artificial The terms \\"planned\\", \\"constructed\\", and \\"artificial\\" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of Interlingua consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed. Similarly, Latino sine flexione (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the inflections have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as \\"planning\\" rather than \\"constructing\\". Some speakers of Esperanto and Esperantidos also avoid the term \\"artificial language\\" because they deny that there is anything \\"unnatural\\" about the use of their language in human communication. By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. Fran√ßois Rabelais's fictional giant Pantagruel, for instance, said: \\"It is a misuse of terms to say that we have natural language; languages are through arbitrary institutions and the conventions of peoples: voices, as the dialecticians say, don't signify naturally, but capriciously.\\"Fran√ßois Rabelais, ≈ívres compl√®tes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973). Also cited in Claude Piron, Le Defi des Langues (L'Harmattan, 1994) . Furthermore, fictional or experimental languages can be considered naturalistic if they model real world languages. For example, if a naturalistic conlang is derived a posteriori from another language (real or constructed), it should imitate natural processes of phonological, lexical, and grammatical change. In contrast with languages such as Interlingua, naturalistic fictional languages are not usually intended for easy learning or communication. Thus, naturalistic fictional languages tend to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like irregular verbs and nouns, and complicated phonological processes. Overview In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into: *Engineered languages (engelangs ), further subdivided into logical languages (loglangs), philosophical languages and experimental languages; devised for the purpose of experimentation in logic, philosophy, or linguistics; *Auxiliary languages (auxlangs) devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language); *Artistic languages (artlangs) devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, just for fun; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs. The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.The \\"Conlang Triangle\\" by Raymond Brown. Accessed 8 August 2008 A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for aesthetic reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories. A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to Ethnologue, there are \\"200‚Äì2000 who speak Esperanto as a first language\\". A member of the Klingon Language Institute, d'Armond Speers, attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) Klingon speaker. As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, Modern Hebrew and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of Hebrew, such as Mishnaic Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew following a general Sephardic pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of Israel was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms \\"Israeli\\", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on Yiddish and other languages spoken by revivalists.Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009). Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls \\"Israeli\\".Let my people know! , Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009. Esperanto as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the Fundamenta Krestomatio, a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.Fundamenta Krestomatio, ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992. Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a \\"better\\" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of Suzette Haden Elgin in creating L√°adan, a feminist language embodied in her feminist science fiction series Native Tongue.\\"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say \\"Elgin, you've got it all wrong!\\" and construct some other \\"women's language\\" to replace it.\\" A constructed language could also be used to restrict thought, as in George Orwell's Newspeak, or to simplify thought, as in Toki Pona. In contrast, linguists such as Steven Pinker argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book The Language Instinct, Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like \\"freedom\\" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish. Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others. An example can be taken from the way various programming languages make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others. Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning Basic English first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of irregular verbs and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see propaedeutic value of Esperanto). Codes for constructed languages include the ISO 639-2 \\"\`art\`\\" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own ISO 639 language codes (e.g. \\"\`eo\`\\" and \\"\`epo\`\\" for Esperanto, \\"jbo\\" for Lojban, \\"\`ia\`\\" and \\"\`ina\`\\" for Interlingua, \\"\`tlh\`\\" for Klingon and \\"\`io\`\\" and \\"\`ido\`\\" for Ido). One constraint on a constructed language is that if it was constructed to be a natural language for use by fictional foreigners or aliens, as with Dothraki and High Valyrian in the Game of Thrones series, which was adapted from the A Song of Ice and Fire book series, the language should be easily pronounced by actors, and should fit with and incorporate any fragments of the language already invented by the book's author, and preferably also fit with any personal names of fictional speakers of the language. A priori and a posteriori languages An a priori constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an a posteriori language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be called a priori when considering some linguistic factors, and at the same time a posteriori when considering other factors. A priori language An a priori language (from Latin a priori, \\"from the former\\") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some a priori languages are designed to be international auxiliary languages that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for a posteriori languages. Others, known as philosophical or taxonomic languages, try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary. Finally, many artistic languages, created for either personal use or for use in a fictional medium, employ consciously constructed grammars and vocabularies, and are best understood as a priori. =Examples of a priori languages= International auxiliary languages * Ro * Sona * Babm * Kotava Experimental languages * Ithkuil * L√°adan Artistic languages * aUI by W. John Weilgart * Dothraki and Valyrian from Game of Thrones * Kƒìlen by Sylvia Sotomayor * Klingon from the science- fiction franchise Star Trek * The languages created by fantasy writer J. R. R. Tolkien A posteriori language An a posteriori language (from Latin a posteriori, \\"from the latter\\"), according to Louis Couturat, is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to controlled versions of natural languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. Likewise, zonal constructed languages (auxiliary languages for speakers of a particular language family) are a posteriori by definition. While most auxiliary languages are a posteriori due to their intended function as a medium of communication, many artistic languages are fully a posteriori in design‚Äîmany for the purposes of alternate history. In distinguishing whether the language is a priori or a posteriori, the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. =Examples of a posteriori languages= Artistic languages * Brithenig * Trigedasleng from The 100 * Atlantean from Atlantis: The Lost Empire * Wenedyk * Toki Pona Controlled auxiliary languages * Basic English * Globish * Latino sine flexione * Special English International auxiliary languages * Volap√ºk * Esperanto * Glosa * Ido * Interlingua * Interlingue * Lingwa de planeta * Lingua Franca Nova * Sambahsa Zonal auxiliary languages * Folkspraak * Interslavic History Ancient linguistic experiments Grammatical speculation dates from Classical Antiquity, appearing for instance in Plato's Cratylus in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply \\"a piece of their own voice... to the thing\\". Athenaeus of Naucratis, in Book III of Deipnosophistae, tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created neologisms like menandros \\"virgin\\" (from menei \\"waiting\\" and andra \\"husband\\"), menekratƒìs \\"pillar\\" (from menei \\"it remains in one place\\" and kratei \\"it is strong\\"), and ballantion \\"javelin\\" (from balletai enantion \\"thrown against someone\\"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are parthenos, stulos, and akon. Alexarchus of Macedon, the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus \\"introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a \\"dawn-crier,\\" a barber as a \\"mortal-shaver,\\" a drachma as \\"worked silver\\"...and a herald as an aputƒìs [from ƒìputa \\"loud-voiced\\"]. \\"He once wrote something... to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the Pythian god could make sense of it.\\" While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages (Latin, Greek, Sanskrit), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, PƒÅ·πáini constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language. Early constructed languages Page 68r of the Voynich manuscript. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical. A legend recorded in the seventh- century Irish work Auraicept na n-√âces claims that F√©nius Farsaid visited Shinar after the confusion of tongues, and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create in B√©rla t√≥baide (\\"the selected language\\"), which he named Go√≠delc‚Äîthe Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature. The earliest non-natural languages were considered less \\"constructed\\" than \\"super-natural\\", mystical, or divinely inspired. The Lingua Ignota, recorded in the 12th century by St. Hildegard of Bingen is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.Joshua Foer, \\"John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented\\", The New Yorker, Dec. 24, 2012. It is a form of private mystical cant (see also language of angels). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is Balaibalan, invented in the 16th century. Kabbalistic grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by Adam and Eve in Paradise, lost in the confusion of tongues. The first Christian project for an ideal language is outlined in Dante Alighieri's De vulgari eloquentia, where he searches for the ideal Italian vernacular suited for literature. Ramon Llull's Ars Magna was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of combinatorics on a given set of concepts. During the Renaissance, Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in cryptographic applications. The Voynich manuscript may be an example of this. Perfecting language Renaissance interest in Ancient Egypt, notably the discovery of the Hieroglyphica of Horapollo, and first encounters with the Chinese script directed efforts towards a perfect written language. Johannes Trithemius, in Steganographia and Polygraphia, attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in magical languages was continued by the Rosicrucians and Alchemists (like John Dee and his Enochian). Jakob Boehme in 1623 spoke of a \\"natural language\\" (Natursprache) of the senses. Musical languages from the Renaissance were tied up with mysticism, magic and alchemy, sometimes also referred to as the language of the birds. The Solresol project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context. 17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages The 17th century saw the rise of projects for \\"philosophical\\" or \\"a priori\\" languages, such as: *Francis Lodwick's A Common Writing (1647) and The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing (1652) * Sir Thomas Urquhart's Ekskybalauron (1651) and Logopandecteision (1652) * George Dalgarno's Ars signorum, 1661 * John Wilkins' Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language, 1668 These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. Leibniz had a similar purpose for his lingua generalis of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side- effect developing binary calculus. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into \\"characters\\" or hierarchies, an idea that with the Enlightenment would ultimately lead to the Encyclop√©die. Many of these 17th‚àí18th centuries conlangs were pasigraphies, or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.Leopold Einstein, \\"Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ƒùis la Nuna Tempo\\", 1884. Reprinted in Fundamenta Krestomatio, UEA 1992 [1903]. Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an a priori language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry Charact√®re, D'Alembert critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the Encyclop√©die, projects for a priori languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe. Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. Ro), but most recent engineered languages have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. Lincos and programming languages), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., Loglan and Lojban) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., Ithkuil). 19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages Already in the Encyclop√©die attention began to focus on a posteriori auxiliary languages. Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve in the article on Langue wrote a short proposition of a \\"laconic\\" or regularized grammar of French. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that Louis Couturat and L√©opold Leau in Histoire de la langue universelle (1903) reviewed 38 projects. The first of these that made any international impact was Volap√ºk, proposed in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer; within a decade, 283 Volap√ºkist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for Esperanto, proposed in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof, and its descendants. Interlingua, the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the International Auxiliary Language Association published its Interlingua‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary and an accompanying grammar. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' Eurolengo, which mixes elements of English and Spanish. Loglan (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the a priori languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern a priori languages have garnered only small groups of speakers. Robot Interaction Language (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer speech recognition algorithms. Artlangs Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such artistic languages begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in Pantagruel, and in Utopian contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century. A Princess of Mars (1912) by Edgar Rice Burroughs was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. J. R. R. Tolkien developed families of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled \\"A Secret Vice\\" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an IAL rather than an artistic language proper.) By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which suggests the existence of a complete language, or whatever portions of the language are needed for the story, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings (Elvish), Stargate SG-1, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Game of Thrones (Dothraki language and Valyrian languages), Avatar, Dune and the Myst series of computer adventure games. Ownership of constructed languages The matter of whether or not a constructed language can be owned or protected by intellectual property laws, or if it would even be possible to enforce those laws, is contentious. In a 2015 lawsuit, CBS and Paramount Pictures challenged a fan film project called Axanar, stating the project infringed upon their intellectual property, which included the Klingon language, among other creative elements. During the controversy, Marc Okrand, the language's original designer expressed doubt as to whether Paramount's claims of ownership were valid.Bhana,Yusuf, Can you copyright a language? Translate Media, June 6 2019Gardner, Eriq, Crowdfunded 'Star Trek' Movie Draws Lawsuit from Paramount, CBS Hollywood Reporter, December 30 2015 David J. Peterson, a linguist who created multiple well-known constructed languages including the Valyrian languages and Dothraki, advocated a similar opinion, saying that \\"Theoretically, anyone can publish anything using any language I created, and, in my opinion, neither I nor anyone else should be able to do anything about it.\\"Owen, Becky,Can you copyright a fictional language? Copyright Licensing Agency, 26 September 2019 However, Peterson also expressed concern that the respective rights-holders‚Äîregardless of whether or not their ownership of the rights is legitimate‚Äîwould be likely to sue individuals who publish material in said languages, especially if the author might profit from said material. Furthermore, comprehensive learning material for such constructed languages as High Valyrian and Klingon has been published and made freely accessible on the language-learning platform Duolingo‚Äîbut those courses are licensed by the respective copyright holders. Because only a few such disputes have occurred thus far, the legal consensus on ownership of languages remains uncertain. Modern conlang organizations Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as Glossopoeic Quarterly, Taboo Jadoo, and The Journal of Planned Languages.\\"How did you find out that there were other conlangers?\\" Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007 The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang- related zines were published as email or websites, such as VortpunojArchives of Vortpunoj at Steve Brewer's website and Model Languages. The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of conlangers with its own customs, such as translation challenges and translation relays,Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). (, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.) and its own terminology. Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time. More recently founded online communities include the Zompist Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board. Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby. Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.\\"Update mailing list statistics‚ÄîFINAL\\", Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001 A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.\\"Average life of a conlang\\" thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008. \\"Average life of a conlang\\" thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread) See also *List of constructed languages *Interlinguistics *Aboriginal constructed languages: Damin, Eskayan *Idioglossia *Cant (language) *ISO, SIL, and BCP language codes for constructed languages *Language construction **Artificial script **Langmaker **Language Construction Kit **Language game **Language regulator **List of language inventors *Language modelling and translation **Knowledge representation **Language translation **Metalanguage **Universal grammar *Mystical languages **Glossolalia **Language of the birds *Spontaneous emergence of grammar **Artificial language **June and Jennifer Gibbons **Nicaraguan Sign Language **Origin of language **Pidgin **Poto and Cabengo *Linguistic determinism *Linguistic relativity *Pasigraphy *Universal language *Basic English Notes References : : :Couturat, Louis (1907).

Scott joins the football team, which causes him to cross paths with Chris. Initially the two seem like the unlikeliest pairing in the world, but a shared secret pulls them together.

They are different from both constructed languages and formal languages in that they have been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like natural languages. Opposed to the idea of a central designer, the field of artificial language evolution in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub- part of the more general cultural evolution studies. Origin The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes were mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.  Motivation  The lack of empirical evidence in the field of evolutionary linguistics has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties. This research is based on the hypothesis that natural language is a complex adaptive system that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying language change as well as questions regarding the origin of language under controlled conditions. Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans, leading up to the new paradigm of experimental semiotics. Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from natural languages, since all languages are artificial insofar as they are conventional (see also Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial).  Uses  Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in statistical language acquisition studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

They were founded in 1998, first presented by the Gaylactic Network in 1999, and in 2002 they were given their own organization, the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation. Logo of the Gaylactic Spectrum Award Foundation Awards are given in categories for novels, short fiction and best other work, although in some years the award for short fiction has not been presented due to lack of sufficient nominees or no nominee of high enough quality. Other categories have also been added and removed in intervening years, and works produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the \\"Hall of Fame\\". Each award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo of the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. No cash award is associated with the other work award, and the cost of the awards is paid for through individual donations and fundraising events. The other works category is open to submissions of works in any non-novel, non-short-fiction medium released during the prior calendar year in North America that includes \\"significant positive GLBT content\\". This includes: comic books, graphic novels, movies, television episodes, multimedia, anthologies, story collections, gaming products, artwork, music. The time- frame of eligibility is based on copyright date for first printing for written works, cover date for magazines and comic books, release date for films, and the first air date for television. The long list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists, and the results are generally announced and presented at Gaylaxicon, although they have also been presented at Worldcon in the past. This article lists all the \\"Best short fiction\\" award nominees and winners, and short fiction hall of fame inductees. Nicola Griffith has won more than once Nicola Griffith is the only creator to have won the other work award more than once, having won twice for editing anthologies; she was also nominated for once for her writing. The creators of Buffy the Vampire Slayer have the record for most nominations, with five, one of which won the award. Cecilia Tan has the record for most nominations without winning, having been a finalist three times for editing anthologies. The most recent winners of the award are an anthology of LGBT themed science fiction entitled The Future Is Queer, edited by Richard Labont√© and Lawrence Schimel, the television series Torchwood, created by Russell T Davies, and the film V for Vendetta, all in 2007. No award was presented to any of the works in the 2008 shortlist.

The marriage was deeply unpopular with the king's subjects and when a daughter, Costanza, was born, the king had to pretend to have her killed while secretly sending her to be brought up by Prince Corrado of Athens. Now, after the recent birth of a son has led to another rebellion from the Thessalians against Griselda as a queen, Gualtiero is forced to dismiss her and promises to take a new wife. The proposed bride is in fact Costanza, who is unaware of her true parentage and unknown to Griselda. She is in love with Corrado's younger brother, Roberto, and the thought of being forced to marry Gualtiero drives her to despair. Act 2 Costanza sings of her torn affections (betrothed to Gualtiero but in love with Roberto) in the coloratura aria Agitata da due venti. Griselda returns to her home in the countryside where she is pursued by the villainous courtier Ottone, who is completely besotted with her and has surreptitiously fomented the popular uprisings in order to derail her marriage. She angrily rejects his advances. Gualtiero and his followers go out hunting and come across Griselda's cottage. Gualtiero foils an attempt by Ottone to kidnap Griselda and allows her back to the court, but only as Costanza's slave. Act 3 Ottone still resolutely pursues Griselda and Gualtiero promises him her hand as soon as he himself has married Costanza. Griselda absolutely refuses and declares she would rather die. At this point, Gualtiero embraces her, having demonstrated her virtue to the rebellious people, and takes her back as his wife. Gualtiero and Corrado reveal the true identity of Costanza, Ottone is pardoned and the girl is allowed to marry Roberto.

It is a document, usually a written survey or inventory, which gives details of glebe, lands and property in the parish owned by the Church of England and held by a clergyman as part of the endowment of his benefice, and which provided the means by which the incumbent (rector, vicar or perpetual curate) could support himself and his church. Typically, glebe would comprise the vicarage or rectory, fields and the church building itself, its contents and its graveyard. If there was an absentee rector the glebe would usually be divided into rectorial glebe and the rest. \\"Terrier\\" is derived from the Latin terra, \\"earth\\". The glebe terrier would be drawn up at the time of each visitation, an official visit usually by the archdeacon. The Archdeacon would visit each parish annually, and the bishop visited outlying parts of his diocese every few years to maintain ecclesiastical authority and conduct confirmations. Each church was entitled to a house and glebe. The glebe lands were either cultivated by the clergyman himself, or by tenants to whom he leased the land. In those cases where the parsonage was not well-endowed with glebe, the clergyman‚Äôs main source of income would come from the tithes. Glebe terriers are useful historical documents as they may contain the names of tenants and the holders of adjoining lands. As the open field system comprised many narrow strips, often isolated from each other, within the larger fields, the terrier can provide useful information on the strips and furlongs in the parish. They may also contain information on how income from tithes was calculated and collected. Full lists of the holdings of each parish were first required in 1571. They vary greatly as the compilation of the survey was undertaken by and at the discretion of each individual clergyman. The surveys were then collected together in the Church of England Registries, but a copy was often kept in the parish. Many are now kept in county record offices. The churchwardens of every parish are now required to maintain a terrier of all church property in the parish, together with an inventory and log- book.Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Care of Churches Measure 2018 section 49, replacing Care of Churches and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1991 section 4 Components An ideal glebe terrier would comprise: *The church and churchyard **a list of everything in the church itself, including its fabric, furniture, plate, bells and books. ** the churchyard with special notes about customary obligations to repair walls or fences. *The parsonage ** a detailed description of the parsonage with its curtilage, a statement of how much of it is brick, wattle and daub, thatch, tile, plaster etc. *Other properties **A detailed description of other buildings in the parish owned by the Church of England, and of the rents charged *Glebe land ** the amount of glebe which belonged to the benefice, often in yardlands, ploughlands or oxgangs, with all the abuttals and boundaries named. ** how much meadow accompanied the ploughland and the method by which this meadow was re- allotted, usually annually. ** how many cow-, horse- or sheep-gates were attached to the benefice and exercisable upon the common. *Tithe revenue ** description of the tithe revenue of the benefice, with details of tithe-free land and the customary arrangements as to the collection of tithe, or the payments in lieu of tithe. * Use of the parish ** notes regarding the use of the parish during Easter offerings, and mortuaries, surplice fees and other customary payments. *Income and fees ** a list of fees which the parish clerk could charge for such things as burial, funeral sermon, breaking the ground, marriage and tolling the bell.

It can be seen as a blanket term for paleobotany, animal osteology, zooarchaeology, microbiology, and many other sub-disciplines. Specifically, plant and animal remains are also called ecofacts. Sometimes these ecofacts can be left by humans and sometimes they can be naturally occurring. Archaeobiology tends to focus on more recent finds, so the difference between archaeobiology and palaeontology is mainly one of date: archaeobiologists typically work with more recent, non-fossilised material found at archaeological sites. Only very rarely are archaeobiological excavations performed at sites with no sign of human presence. Flora and Fauna in Archaeology The prime interest of paleobotany is to reconstruct the vegetation that people in the past would have encountered in a particular place and time. Plant studies have always been overshadowed by faunal studies because bones are more conspicuous than plant remains when excavating. Collection of plant remains could everything including pollen, soil, diatoms, wood, plant remains and phytoliths. Phytoliths are sediments and diatoms are water deposits. Each plant remain can tell the archaeologist different things about the environment during a certain time period. Animal remains were the first evidence used by 19th century archaeologists. Today, archaeologists use faunal remains as a guide to the environment. It helps archaeologists understand whether the fauna were present naturally or through activities of carnivores or people. Archaeologists deal with macrofauna and microfauna. Microfauna are better indicators of climate and environmental change than larger species. These can be as small as a bug or as big as a fish or bird. Macrofauna helps archaeologists build a picture of past human diet. Bacteria and Protists in Archaeology Bacteria and Protists form two separate kingdoms, but both are fairly similar when compared. Bacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms, while protists are a group of eukaryotic organisms. Because both are microorganisms, both fall under the study of microbiology and special techniques are required for archaeologists to even see them. Archaeologists, in order to find these microorganisms in a site, have to first take samples from the site and bring them in for lab analysis. Once in the lab, they can use equipment such as optical microscopes, in order to actually see evidence of micro organic remains. Archaeologists that look at these microorganisms do not actually find the living bacteria or protist, but instead find indentations left behind in material from where they had been. Depending on where the indentations were in the strata, archaeologists can determine the age of the microorganisms. Paleomycology Paleomycology is the study of fungi in the fossil record. The study of past fungi can lead to the evolutionary past. Much of fungi are made up of parasites of animals, plants or insects. Most of the contemporary fungi resemble its ancestors, dating back over a million years ago. For example, ‚ÄúIn the Dominican amber, a mosquito was found with several types of parasitic fungi growing on its outside cuticle. What is interesting is that the fungi resemble modern day fungi in class Trichomycetes, which are common gut- inhabiting zygomycetes of insects, but they differ from Trichomycetes in that the fungi are on the outside of the insect rather than the inside.‚Äù The study of ancient fungi can be used to track the evolution of fungi through millions of years. Osteology in Archaeology The study of osteology is a study of bones and can be a subdiscipline in archeology. Osteologists in archeology reconstruct bones of humans or animals from the past to find more about the past civilizations. Osteology is used in archaeology to determine the age, gender, and ethnicity of the remains. It is also helpful to rebuild past societies‚Äô cultural background. Osteology shares past activities pursued by the ancient cultures including human and animal migrations as well as warfare. Using the remains from the past can help modern archaeologist uncover the past from what they ate to their daily activities. This can help uncover the mysteries of past histories.  Animals in Archaeology  Zooarchaeology: comparing an archaeological bone to a modern bone in a comparative collection The study of animal remains in archaeology teaches how humans and animals interacted with one another in prehistoric times. This gives an insight on how humans began domesticating animals. In zooarchaeology, studies will show the animal and human husbandry, as well as the process of cultures adding animals into their diets. Studying animals in archaeology requires the help from different fields such as zoology, anthropology, paleontology, osteology, and anatomy. Zooarchaeologists gather and observe the fragments of the bones from reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and birds around an archaeological site. Thus, they will gather context clues on how humans and animals subsided together within their environment. Through the years, humans have learned the basics of how to domesticate, breed, hunt and consume animals. This area in archaeology informs others on how humans have evolved into manipulating animals throughout prehistory and beyond.

Miller Fisher (December 5, 1913, Waterloo, Ontario - April 14, 2012, Albany, New York) was a Canadian neurologist whose notable contributions include the first detailed descriptions of lacunar strokes, the identification of transient ischemic attacks as stroke precursors, the identification of the link between carotid atherosclerosis and stroke, and the description of a variant form of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome which bears his name. Education and career Fisher received a B.A. from Victoria University in Toronto in 1935. He then attended the University of Toronto Medical School, where he received his M.D. in 1938. He continued training at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. During World War II, Fisher served as a surgical lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Navy, and was aboard HMS Voltaire when it was sunk by German gunfire in 1941 off the coast of Cape Verde. Fisher was captured and spent 3.5 years in a German prison camp, until late 1944 when he was released. Following his return to Canada, Fisher began his residency at McGill University at the Royal Victoria Hospital. In 1946 he worked as a Fellow at the Montreal Neurological Institute of McGill University. He then began working at Massachusetts General Hospital on the stroke service, beginning a long career in stroke neurology. Contributions Fisher is credited with describing the clinical syndrome of the transient ischemic attack (\\"mini-stroke\\"). Fisher proved, by a series of pathological studies, the relationship between stroke and the formation of blood clots in the heart in patients with atrial fibrillation. He also showed the relationship between stroke and carotid artery stenosis, which made preventive surgery possible and greatly reduced the incidence of subsequent strokes. He was a founder of Massachusetts General Hospital Stroke Service. He contributed greatly towards the current use of anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. He contributed greatly to the understanding of stroke, more specifically carotid artery disease and lacunar infarcts and their syndromes. With regard to the lacunar syndromes he described the concept, the \\"pure motor stroke\\", the \\"pure sensory stroke\\", and the mechanism underlying the different stroke syndromes. He made a number of contributions to the understanding of cervical artery dissection (carotid artery dissection and vertebral artery dissection) in the 1970s, and that of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to cerebral aneurysms. In 1956 he reported a variant of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, nowadays known as Miller Fisher Syndrome. \\"Fisher test\\" is also used to describe the CSF tap test which may be required in the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Personal life C. Miller Fisher was married to Doris M. Fisher for 68 years until her death in 2008. He had two sons and one daughter. Awards and honors In 1952 he was the recipient of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada's Prize in Medicine, and in 1998 he entered the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. Death Fisher died April 14, 2012 in St. Peter's Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Albany, New York. He was 98 years old. References External links * *C. Miller Fisher Papers, 1827-2004 (inclusive).

Development  After the end of WWII the British Gliding Association (BGA) recognised a need for two-seat training gliders to replace the unsafe and inefficient solo training techniques that were prevalent at the time, launching a competition to design a two-seat trainer. Though Slingsby did not enter the competition it spurred them to look in the early 1950s at a two-seat version of their Type 34 Sky. The advent of the NACA laminar flow aerofoil sections at that time prompted them to start from scratch, designing a large aircraft with nearly 18 m span, three-part wings and a large fuselage with spacious, comfortable cockpits. The fuselage is built up as a wooden truss with a plywood-covered stressed-skin top decking and wooden semi- monocoque forward fuselage. The cockpits are covered by two canopies, the forward one hinging to starboard and the rear hinged at the rear forming part of the leading edge, in the cut-outs provided for access to the rear seat. The wings are built up from wood with plywood covering back to the rear spar inboard of the ailerons and forward of the mainspar outboard. A rectangular constant-thickness/chord ratio centre section sits atop the fuselage out to approximately 1/5 span each side where the tapering outer wings are fitted, with the leading edge unswept. Large, effective plate-type airbrakes are fitted, aft of the mainspar, to the wings at approximately 1/3 span extending out from upper and lower surfaces. Plywood-skinned low-set tailplane and fin with fabric-covered built-up wooden elevators and rudder are at the tail end of the fuselage, the elevators fitted with trim tabs, one for longitudinal trim and one to compensate for pitch-up with operation of the airbrakes. The undercarriage comprises a single mainwheel just aft of the loaded centre of gravity with a large nose skid faired in with leather or canvas and a metal tailskid.  Variants  ;Slingsby Type 42 Eagle 1 :The first prototype fitted with a 17.86 m swept-forward wing with cutouts in the root for access to the rear seat. The prototype suffered from poor performance traced to the leading edge cut-outs. This aircraft was destroyed after a mid-air collision with a Slingsby Type 34 Sky near Lasham, Hants on 14 June 1958. ;Slingsby Type 42B Eagle 2 :The second prototype introduced a simplified wing with no leading edge sweep-forward and the cutouts filled by the rear canopy. It won the two- seater class at the World Gliding Championships at Saint-Yan, France in 1956, piloted by Nicholas Goodhart and Frank Foster, coming second overall. This glider still flies at Devon & Somerset Gliding Club, [North Hill], England. ;Slingsby Type 42B Eagle 3 :Production aircraft fitted with a 17.7 m wing and cockpits moved forward; fifteen built. ;Slingsby Type 55 Regal Eagle :A single Eagle 3 (c/n 1117 / BGA 821) fitted with a 20 m span wing in 1966‚Äì67, used to break the UK two-seat goal flight record with a flight from Odiham to Perranporth (312 km) piloted by Wally Kahn and John Williamson. This aircraft was destroyed in a fire at Doncaster in March 1975. Specifications See also Notes and references Notes References * * * Further reading * Taylor, J. H.

The castle was first documented in the 14th century and belonged to the lords of Keutzl, the lords of Pirglstein and later the lords of Rehling until the 16th century. In the 17th century, the castle was purchased by Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun, but in 1695 it became a nunnery of the Ursuline Sisters. However, this was short-lived and three years later, the nuns moved to Gst√§ttengasse. In 1791, gardener Sebastian Rosenegger bought the property and encouraged the building of a new park in the castle grounds. He passed it to his son, the businessman and amateur archaeologist Josef Rosenegger. In 1792, Rosenegger discovered, during excavations for the new park, a large Roman cemetery and treasures. The park soon became a popular destination from miles around Salzburg, and it was visited by several state leaders. After a fire in 1814, the castle was rebuilt. On 3 January 1842, Eberhard Fugger, a renowned geologist and director of the Salzburg Museum, bought the castle. In 1861, Princess Sophie of Arenberg purchased the castle and expanded it further by linking the two three-story buildings with a central tower. From 1912 to 1922, the building served as the home of the writer and philosopher Hermann Bahr and his wife, Anna Bahr-Mildenburg, an opera singer and co-founder of the Salzburg Festival. In 1931, the castle became owned by the government of Salzburg. In January 2001, the Salzburg Stiftung of the American Austrian Foundation purchased the castle from the regional government of Salzburg. In 2005, after a total renovation, the castle opened as a conference center. On 20 April 2009, the castle was destroyed by a fire caused by welders on the roof.

It was published in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment in February 2009, in North America by Atlus USA in October 2009, and in PAL territories by Namco Bandai Games in June 2010. The game is referred to as a spiritual successor to FromSoftware's King's Field series. Demon's Souls is set in Boletaria, a kingdom consumed by a dark being called the Old One following its release through the use of forbidden Soul Arts. Players take on the role of a hero brought to Boletaria to kill its fallen king Allant and pacify the Old One. Gameplay has players navigating five different worlds from a hub called the Nexus, with a heavy emphasis on challenging combat and mechanics surrounding player death and respawning. Online multiplayer allows both player cooperation and world invasions featuring player versus player combat. The game's early development was troubled due to a lack of coherent vision. Despite such issues, FromSoftware staff member Hidetaka Miyazaki was able to take over the project and helped to turn the title into what it eventually became. The game's difficulty was intended to both evoke classic video games and provide a sense of challenge and accomplishment for players. This aspect proved demanding for Miyazaki, partly because of his fear that Sony would ask the team to lower the difficulty in order to make the game more accessible. The multiplayer elements were inspired by events in Miyazaki's life. Announced in 2008, early reactions to Demon's Souls demo were seen as negative, and the game's high difficulty prompted Sony to pass on publishing the title outside of Japan. While the game met with middling reception and sales in Japan, it became a commercial and critical success in the West. The game was praised for its difficult combat and addictive gameplay, subsequently winning several awards. Its success began a series of Souls games starting with Dark Souls in 2011. A remake by Bluepoint Games will be released for the PlayStation 5 in November 2020.  Gameplay  The player confronting the red dragon. The light tint around the player character indicates that they are in soul form, having previously died resulting in a health bar cut in half. Demon's Souls is an action role-playing game where players take on the role of an adventurer, whose gender and appearance are customized at the beginning of the game, exploring the cursed land of Boletaria. Aspects of the customization impact various statistics (stats) related to gameplay. The player character is granted a starting character class, which further influences their stats, though they can be altered later in the game and effectively change a player's class combined with a different weapon choice. The world is divided into six areas; the Nexus hub world and five additional worlds subdivided into four areas which each end in a boss encounter. Combat is reliant on timing for weapon strikes and blocks, with different weapon types opening up a variety of combat options and altering the player's movement speed. Most actions drain a stamina meter, with its management forming a core part of combat. By defeating an enemy, the player acquires Souls, which act as both experience points to raise various statistics; and the game's currency for purchasing new weapons, armor and items. As the player invests, the number of souls required increases. Along with souls, players can retrieve items such as weaponry and ore for upgrading. When a player is killed during a level, they are sent to the beginning of the level with all non-boss enemies re-spawned, while the player returns in soul form with lower maximum health and the loss of all unused souls. After dying in an area, normal enemies respawn. If the player manages to reach their bloodstain at the point where they were last killed, they regain their lost souls. However, if they are killed before then, the souls are lost permanently. Upon defeating a boss, the player can choose to re-spawn back to that location, marked in the form of an Archstone. When not exploring a level, players reside in the Nexus, a realm that acts as a hub where players can exchange souls, store items and travel between regions. After completing the initial portion of the first region, players can choose to progress through any other of the newly available regions. Demon's Souls make use of asynchronous multiplayer for those connected to the PlayStation Network. The game incorporates multiplayer elements into its single-player campaign. During gameplay, players briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate. Players can leave pre- written messages on the floor that can also help others such as forewarning safe or hostile positions, trap locations and tactics against enemies or bosses, among general comments. Co-operative play allows up to three characters to team up in a host world where visiting players appear in soul form that can only be returned to their bodies when a boss is defeated. In competitive play, players can invade another world as a Black Phantom to engage in combat with the host player. If the Black Phantom kills the host, they can be returned to their body in their own game, whereas if killed themselves, the host gains a portion of the Black Phantom's souls as well as the phantom losing an experience level. Some multiplayer elements are incorporated directly into gameplay events. Several mechanics in the game are covered by World and Character Tendency. Character Tendency impacts the entire game, while World Tendency only affects a particular region. Character Tendency is influenced by a character's behaviour; starting from neutral, the player can shift their Tendency to black or white. Black tendency is triggered by actions such as killing NPCs and being antagonistic towards other players, in addition to dying repeatedly in a world. White tendency is born from helping others and being supportive to other players, and defeating bosses. World Tendency exists separately from Character Tendency; black tendency raises the difficulty by increasing enemy health while giving more valuable rewards, while white tendency allows more item drops and makes enemies weaker at the cost of rare items. World Tendency is also influenced by the overall Tendency of worlds on servers. At either end of the Tendency spectrum, exclusive events occur and new areas can be unlocked.  Synopsis  Demon's Souls takes place in the kingdom of Boletaria. In ancient times, due to the misuse of magic known as the Soul Arts, Boletaria was attacked by a being called the Old One. The world was nearly consumed by the magical \\"Deep Fog\\" and the soul-eating demons it created. The Old One was eventually lulled to slumber, saving what remained of Boletaria, while some survivors became long- lived Monumentals to warn future generations. In the game's present, Boletaria's ruler King Allant restored the Soul Arts, awakening the Old One and its demon army. Boletaria is now being consumed by demons, with those humans without souls turning into insane monsters. Players take the role of an adventurer entering the fog engulfing Boletaria. After being killed, the player wakes up in the Nexus and meets a benevolent demon called the Maiden in Black, as well as various other characters. Now bound to the Nexus until the Old One is returned to slumber, the player travels to five regions of Boletaria, killing the powerful demons controlling those areas and absorbing their souls to increase their power so they can face King Allant. However, the King Allant the player faces is revealed to be a demon imposter. After defeating the false King Allant, the Maiden in Black takes the player‚Äînow dubbed the \\"Slayer of Demons\\"‚Äîto the Old One. The Slayer of Demons faces the true King Allant, who has been transformed into a helpless blob-like demon, within the Old One's body. The Maiden in Black then arrives to put the Old One to sleep again. If the Slayer of Demons leaves the Old One, they are hailed as the hero of the restored, though damaged, Boletaria, becoming a new Monumental to support the world as the knowledge of Soul Arts is lost. If the Slayer of Demons kills the Maiden in Black, they serve the Old One and sate their hunger for souls as the fog continues to spread.  Development  Demon's Souls was developed by FromSoftware, a developer noted for creating the King's Field and Armored Core series. The project was first proposed and supported by SCE Japan Studio. Demon's Souls was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, who had joined the company in 2004 and worked as a coder on the Armored Core series. The game was co-produced by FromSoftware's Masanori Takeuchi and Sony's Takeshi Kajii. The concept of reviving a \\"lost breed of action game\\" was first proposed by Kajii. Due to the team lacking a coherent vision, the original project had run into difficulties. Hearing about a high fantasy role-playing game which was considered a failure within the company, Miyazaki decided that if he could take over the project he could take it in any direction he wanted. Since it was already flagging, it did not matter if his own efforts failed. Including this early work, production of the game took approximately three years. The team was made up of veteran developers and older staff members. The initial concept for Demon's Souls came from FromSoftware's King's Field series, with Miyazaki citing its dark tone and high difficulty as the main inspirations for the game. Despite these inspirations, Miyazaki did not want to connect Demon's Souls to King's Field, and despite his urging otherwise many have termed the game as a spiritual successor to King's Field. Miyazaki hoped to take gaming back to its basics, creating a challenging gameplay-based experience he felt was dying out in the gaming market of the time. He wanted to create a game which would recreate the dark fantasy and hardcore feel of classic RPG titles (such as the King's Field and Wizardry series) on modern consoles, along with incorporated online elements. Miyazaki acknowledged some similarities to other video games such as Monster Hunter and Bushido Blade, but said the team did not have any specific video game influences in mind when creating Demon's Souls. After the first design documents were created, the game concept changed little during development. The final game did not come together in a playable form until very late in development, and even then there were network and framerate problems. The team were given a high amount of creative freedom, only possible due to what Kajii called \\"fortunate timing and release schedules\\". The Souls system was a frequent subject of discussion during development, with the current system being decided upon as there being no risk of loss for souls would rob the game of any accomplishment for players. The unconventional death mechanics forced Miyazaki to carefully phrase the Soul mechanic during design document pitches to Sony, as he was worried they would insist on changes if they knew the full details. When creating the high difficulty, Miyazaki kept quiet about that aspect when talking with Sony, as he was sure they would insist upon the difficulty being lowered. He talked it over with Kajii, who agreed to keep that aspect quiet until release. Despite its reputation as a hard game, Miyazaki never intended the game to be hard, instead aiming for a challenging and rewarding experience for players. One scrapped idea was to introduce permanent death, but this was seen by staff as going too far. Variety was added to combat by changing how different weapons affected the character's movements, similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. All the bosses were designed based on a simple premise, in addition to being \\"varied and exciting\\". The multiplayer mechanics were inspired by Miyazaki's experience of driving on a hillside after some heavy snow. When cars ahead stopped and started slipping back, they were deliberately bumped into and pushed up the hill by the cars behind them, thus allowing the traffic to flow. Unable to give his appreciation to the drivers before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet those people again. Miyazaki wanted to emulate a sense of silent cooperation in the face of adversity. This gave birth to the Phantom systems, with the implementation of Black and Blue Phantoms designed to increase the variety of experience of players. The messaging system was intended to be nonintrusive, with Miyazaki comparing them to text messages. This system proved difficult for Miyazaki to explain to Sony, with him eventually comparing his messaging to the brevity of an email over a phone call so executives could understand it. The team wanted to avoid the formation of questing parties between players; the multiplayer was designed more to enhance the single-player content rather than be a separate mode. The Old Monk battle, which involved summoning another player as a Black Phantom during the boss battle, caused trouble due to the high number of bugs the team needed to sort out. Describing the narrative, Kajii said the team's aim was to \\"sidestep preset narrative\\" to focus on gameplay. The world view and tone of the world drew from that of King's Field. The tone was influenced by both Miyazaki and Kajii, who were both fans of dark fantasy. When creating the world, Miyazaki drew inspiration from European folklore and mythology, contrasting with the trend of Japanese action RPGs to use Japanese folklore. Direct influences included Arthurian and Germanic folklore, the fantasy movies Conan the Barbarian and Excalibur, and the artwork of Frank Frazetta. The team were also influenced by old gamebooks. This darker art style was partly influenced by their goals with the gameplay. The art style was also influenced by Western titles more than those from Japan. The Maiden in Black was put in at Kajii's request as he wanted a heroine as part of the narrative. As she would be seen in close-up and eyes were the weakest aspect of character models, the team designed her without eyes. Miyazaki had several more worlds in his early design, with the latest to be cut being a world called the Library and an outside area for the Nexus. The Tower of Latria and Valley of Defilement were built around the respective themes of man-made and natural evil. The fully orchestrated music was composed by Shunsuke Kida, who had worked on few video games but was famous for composing music for several Japanese television series. He was brought on board due to his skill at orchestral composition. The music was dark in tone, with many pieces for solo violin or piano, while other tracks made use of a full orchestra. The vocal work was all choral, maintaining the game's dark atmosphere. Three tracks included vocal work from Japanese singer Kokia. Release Demon's Souls was first announced in early October 2008 through that week's issue of Famitsu, with the game being playable at the Tokyo Game Show (TGS) the following week. Reaction to the TGS demo was described by Kajii as \\"nothing short of a disaster\\" due to its unexpectedly challenging nature. Many people assumed the game's combat was still in development, with Kajii lamenting that the game was unsuited for a demo environment. Sony president Shuhei Yoshida was also dismissive of the game. When he play-tested it, he spent two hours playing the game and failed to get beyond the starting area. Believing it to be simply poor quality, he called it \\"an unbelievably bad game\\". Demon's Souls released in Japan on February 5, 2009 by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan. Due to negative feedback from Sony staff and the Japanese press, Sony decided against localizing the game for Western markets, a decision Sony and Yoshida in particular later regretted. Sony did create an English text version of the game for the Asian market. This version was translated by Active Gaming Media. The Chinese language version was released on February 26. The game's voice acting was in English for all versions. Due to its Medieval European setting, the team decided against using American English actors, asking Sony to handle that aspect. Most of the actors were Scottish. The game was again localized from Japanese to English by Active Gaming Media. Active Gaming Media's James Mountain was the game's primary translator. He tried to translate and localize the dialogue as naturally as possible. While he never saw any art or video assets from the game, he interpreted the original text's tone to a \\"knights, dragons, demons-type action-oriented RPG\\". With this in mind, he included archaic words such as \\"thee\\" \\"thy\\" and \\"thou\\". His early draft used a lot of archaic dialogue, but upon a second look Mountain decided to rewrite parts of this as they felt lacking. The game was licensed for release in North America by Atlus USA. While Sony were reluctant to license out a game for third-party publishing, they wanted the game to find a suitable niche and first-party publishing was no longer an option. The North American localization mainly addressed \\"grammar/inaccuracy issues\\" from the overseas version. Atlus USA were aware of the game's high difficulty, but were impressed by the game's quality and decided to take it on. Also due to the high difficulty, they planned for conservative sales figures. The game released in North America on October 6, coming in both standard and limited edition. The game was published in PAL territories by Namco Bandai Games in partnership with Sony. The European version came in standard and limited editions. The game was released across PAL territories, including Europe and Australia, on June 25. The North American servers for Demon's Souls were originally planned for shutdown in October 2011, two years after the game's release in the region. Atlus decided a month before to keep the servers running until May the following year. Later, after unspecified new developments, Atlus announced that it would keep the servers running \\"indefinitely\\". They were finally discontinued worldwide in February 2018. Their discontinuation meant the end of multiplayer functionality, messaging, and the World Tendency mechanics. A few months after the servers went offline, a group of fans created a private server which restored all online functions. Remake A remake by Bluepoint Games for the PlayStation 5 was announced at its reveal event in June 2020. It will release as a launch title for the system on November 12, 2020.  Reception  Upon its release in Japan, Demon's Souls was generally well received by critics. Dengeki scored the game 95/85/85/85, adding up to 350 out of 400, saying that \\"fans of old-school games will shed tears of joy.\\" Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40 (9/7/7/6), with an editor Paint Yamamoto scoring it a 9 and calling it \\"a game you learn how to play by losing ‚Äì you'll face sudden death frequently. But! Keep playing... and you'll realize how deep it really is.\\" However, another editor, Maria Kichiji, gave it a 6 and found the game to be \\"far too stoic... it's not a game for everybody.\\" Upon release in North America, the game received critical acclaim with an average critic score of at Metacritic. Despite the game's high difficulty, many reviewers found it to be a positive aspect, making the game more rewarding to play. GameSpot called the high difficulty \\"fair\\", saying players will \\"undoubtedly take a lot of damage until you learn the subtleties of fighting each enemy, but combat feels just right.\\" IGN echoed this view, saying that players who \\"can remember the good ol' days when games taught through the highly effective use of negative reinforcement and a heavy price for not playing it carefully should scoop this up instantly.\\" Game Informer called it \\"one of the first truly great Japanese RPGs of this generation, and certainly the most remarkable.\\" Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine however, while commending the game overall, said Demon's Souls was \\"best left to the most masochistic, hardcore gamer.\\" GameZone commented on the online aspect as being \\"innovative\\" and \\"perfectly blended into the game\\", while Game Revolution felt it \\"turns a solitary experience into a surprisingly communal one.\\" On the technical and design side GamesRadar called it \\"graphically stunning, too, looking more like the old Ultima games than anything that‚Äôs ever come out of Japan,\\" while GameTrailers said the game \\"nails the dark fantasy look\\" along with what they considered \\"music from actual instruments\\", although they mentioned certain issues with the physics engine being \\"jittery\\". Shortly after its North American release, ScrewAttack named Demon's Souls as the eighth best PS3 exclusive to date. Prior to the game's release in Europe, European critics reviewed import copies. Eurogamer called Demon's Souls \\"stoic, uncompromising, difficult to get to know, but also deep, intriguingly disturbed and perversely rewarding\\" while Edge explained their positive view on the difficulty by stating \\"if gaming‚Äôs ultimate appeal lies in the learning and mastering of new skills, then surely the medium‚Äôs keenest thrills are to be found in its hardest lessons\\", concluding \\"for those who flourish under Demon‚Äôs Souls‚Äô strict examination, there's no greater sense of virtual achievement.\\" Sales During its first week on sale, Demon's Souls debuted at second place in the charts with over 39,000 units sold, coming in behind the previous week's top-seller Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2. The game sold through 95% of its shipment during its debut, selling out in several stores. According to Miyazaki, initial sales for Demon's Souls were slow in Japan, which combined with negative reactions from trade shows made the team fearful that the game would be a failure. However, positive word of mouth eventually allowed the game to sell over 100,000 copies, which the team considered a success. It sold 134,585 copies in Japan by December 2009. Atlus had estimated the game's sales at 75,000 units, only preparing initial shipments of 15,000 units before positive word of mouth and critical acclaim caused sales to take off. In North America, the game was the eleventh best-selling title during its month of release, posting sales of 150,000 units. By March 2010, the game had sold 250,000 copies in North America. According to Atlus, the game sold triple their original estimates by April 2010. During their fiscal year report, Atlus' parent company Index Corporation reported profits of over $3 million. This was almost entirely attributed to the commercial success of Demon's Souls. In September 2010, Atlus announced that Demon's Souls would be released in North America under the Sony Greatest Hits label with a price cut following strong sales, higher than previously expected by the publisher. Its status indicated regional sales of over 500,000 units. In the United Kingdom, the game's special edition sold out very fast apart from \\"dribs and drabs\\". This was classed as a success by Namco Bandai, particularly due to the long delay between the North American and European releases. While units sold did not reach hundreds of thousands at the time, Namco Bandai were confident in the game's future commercial success. Demon's Souls favorable review scores made the fiscal performance of the game unique because of the lack of a supporting marketing campaign. Gaming analyst Jesse Divnich commented \\"Demon's Souls is probably one of the most statistically relevant games released in the gaming world as it helps answer an often asked question: how much would a high quality game sell if it was supported by no mass marketing, released by a little known publisher, and was a new intellectual property.\\" As of 2011, the game has sold over one million copies worldwide.  Awards  In their 2009 Best and Worst Awards, GameSpot awarded Demon's Souls with Overall Game of the Year, Best PS3 game, Best Role-Playing game and Best Original Game Mechanic for the online integration. GameTrailers awarded it Best RPG and Best New intellectual property. IGN also awarded the game Best RPG for the PS3. X-Play awarded the multiplayer Best Gameplay Innovation. PC World awarded it Game of the Year. RPGamer awarded Demon's Souls RPG of the Year 2009, including Best Graphics and Best PS3 RPG.

Design and development Fred Slingsby wanted to take a larger slice of the glider market with a small low-cost sailplane with better than average performance. The key to this ethos was smaller aircraft use less materials and modern aerofoil sections could give much better performance. Slingsby appointed John Reussner as draughtsman and designer for the T.37 Skylark. The relatively new five- digit NACA series of aerofoil sections was chosen because they would give low drag over a wide airspeed range (\\"wide Drag Bucket\\"). To maintain laminar flow and gain the benefit of the NACA sections it was necessary to build the wings very accurately and ensure that the surface remained true during the life of the aircraft. This was achieved by using the low-density but stiff Gaboon plywood. The leading edge was fashioned from accurately-spindled hollow spruce members with rebates to accept the gaboon ply wing panels extending back to the rear spar, leaving only a small area to be covered with fabric. The fuselage was a simple structure built up from struts and covered with plywood back to the rear of the wing support pylon, and fabric covering over the rear fuselage. Ply-covered tail surfaces and fabric-covered control surfaces completed the airframe. Further weight and cost was saved by not fitting a landing wheel. History The Skylark was successful to a limited degree but it introduced Slingsby to new manufacturing techniques and the vagaries of laminar flow. As with modern gliders any reduction in laminar flow caused a disproportionate increase in drag, reinforcing the need for careful handling, cleaning and polishing, and avoiding rain while flying. Despite the promising performance of the T.37 Skylark the British gliding fraternity convinced Fred Slingsby to modify his thinking and produce gliders with lower wing loadings, through increased span and wing area.

Features The Phenom II triples the shared L3 cache size from 2MB (in the original Phenom line) to 6MB, leading to benchmark performance gains as high as 30%. In another change from the original Phenom, Cool'n'Quiet applies to the processor as a whole, rather than on a per-core basis. AMD implemented this to address the mishandling of threads by Windows Vista, which can cause single-threaded applications to run on a core that idles at half its clock rate. This feature can be disabled through BIOS options on most motherboards, which allows for customization and overclocking. Due to the nature of this feature, it reduces the effectiveness of overclocking the CPU and RAM, but also decreases power consumption and heat output. Socket AM2+ versions of the Phenom II (920, 940) lack forward- compatibility with Socket AM3. Socket AM3 versions of the Phenom II are backwards-compatible with Socket AM2+, though this is contingent on motherboard manufacturers supplying BIOS updates. In addition to the Phenom II's pin compatibility, the AM3 memory controller supports both DDR2 and DDR3 memory (up to DDR2-1066 and DDR3-1333), allowing existing AM2+ users to upgrade their CPU without changing the motherboard or memory. However, similar to the way the original Phenom handled DDR2-1066, current Phenom II platforms limit the usage of DDR3-1333 to one DIMM per channel; otherwise, the DIMMs are under clocked to DDR3-1066. AMD claims that this behaviour is due to the BIOS, not the memory controller; several board manufacturers have addressed the issue with a BIOS update. The dual-spec memory controller also gives motherboard manufacturers and system builders the option of pairing AM3 with DDR2, as compared to competing chips from Intel which require DDR3. \\"Thuban\\" and \\"Zosma\\" Phenom II processors support AMD's Turbo Core overclocking performance-boost technology. When not all cores are needed, the processor will automatically overclock up to half of the cores by up to 500 MHz, leaving the other half idle. In turn, when the application demands more than half of the cores, the processor will run on standard clock rate and with all cores enabled. The flagship AMD Phenom II X6 1100T shifts 3.3GHz to 3.7GHz. Some top-level AM3 processors (x945 125W, x955 and x965) require a special power- supply feature, often called \\"dual power-plane\\". It's supported by default in all native AM3 mainboards, however not in most AM2+ mainboards, even those advertised as \\"AM3 optimized\\" or \\"AM3 ready\\". Processor running below its nominal speed (i.e. at 800 MHz), clock and multiplier locked are symptoms of this incompatibility. This is caused by the processor itself: when it detects that the motherboard does not supply dual power planes, the chip locks its multiplier to 4x. This issue is not resolvable via a BIOS update; however, users of AM2 and AM2+ motherboards can still use Phenom II processors excluding the 125 watt variants. {  style=\\"margin:auto;\\" !colspan=\\"6\\"AMD Phenom II-based processor family - !rowspan=\\"2\\"AMD K10 !colspan=\\"5\\"Desktop - !Hexa-core !Quad-core !Quad-core !Triple-core !Dual- core - style=\\"background:white\\" !Code-named Thuban Zosma Deneb Heka Callisto - style=\\"background:white\\" !Process 45 nm 45 nm 45 nm 45 nm 45 nm - style=\\"background:white\\" !Date released Apr 2010 Jun 2010 Jan 2009 Feb 2009 Jun 2009 - !colspan=\\"6\\"List of AMD Phenom microprocessors } Beginning with the AM3 versions, Phenom II CPUs are based on two dies: the original Deneb die with four cores and the new Thuban die with six. These are divided into five series for marketing. The first two series are flagships based on full dies. The other three series are formed from Deneb dies by die harvesting, that is, chips that were produced with some amount of defects. The affected portions of these chips are disabled and the chips themselves marked as a lower-grade product. die of a four-core Phenom II processor. * 1000T series: Flagship X6 series with full complement of cores, L3 cache enabled and Turbo Core. * 900T series: Based on X6 series but with two cores disabled and Turbo Core. * 900 series: X4 series with full complement of cores and L3 cache enabled. * 800 (original) series: These are X4 chips with some amount of defect in the L3 cache; 2 MB is disabled, leaving the chip with 4 MB L3 cache and fully operational cores. Available as model 805, 810, 820 and 830. * 800 (second) series: These are chips based on the Athlon II Propus quad-core without L3 cache albeit marketed as Phenom II, available as model 840 and 850 * 700 series: These chips have one core disabled, leaving them with three operational cores (marketed as \\"X3\\") and a fully operational L3 cache. * 500 series: These chips have two cores disabled, leaving them with two operational cores (marketed as \\"X2\\") and a fully operational L3 cache. Some versions of the Phenom II X2 and X3 have one or two cores \\"deactivated\\" to enable AMD to target the lower end of its market. However, from outside, a user can never determine whether the disabling of the core(s) was merely due to marketing reasons (with the disabled cores being fully functional in reality) or whether they are actually defective hardware-wise. So even though with the correct motherboard and BIOS, it is possible to unlock the deactivated core(s) of the processor, success is never guaranteed, because the user might catch the awkward case where one or more core(s) were deactivated due to faulty silicon. Hardware enthusiast websites have collected and summarized anecdotal reports that, overall, indicate about a 70% success rate, but these reports likely have self-reporting bias, and more importantly, it is impossible to know whether an unlocked core is truly bug-free. Overclocking An AMD Phenom II X4 840 quad-core CPU. According to AMD, Black Edition CPUs are \\"designed to help you unleash the maximum potential of your system with tunable performance.\\" What this means is that the core multiplier is unlocked, allowing for modification of the CPU speed without changing the FSB or HyperTransport. On a non-black edition CPU, the multiplier is allowed to only be lowered. The standard processors allow for overclocking, however not to the point that a Black edition CPU will. The Phenom II range of CPUs is the first series of AMD CPUs to have a low enough minimum temperature of operation to support \\"extreme\\" cooling methods such as dry ice, liquid nitrogen or liquid helium, a deficiency in older CPUs referred to as the \\"Cold Bug\\". In a public demonstration of the Phenom II's overclocking potential at CES 2009 in Las Vegas on 10 January 2009, Sami \\"Macci\\" M√§kinen (a record-breaking overclocker) used a Phenom II X4 940 and a DFI LANParty 790FXB-M2RS with a combination of liquid nitrogen and liquid helium cooling to take the processor to a clock rate of 6.5 GHz and succeeded in beating the world record 3DMark 2005 score with a total of 45474. A group named LimitTeam successfully overclocked AMD‚Äôs Deneb 45 nm Phenom II X4 955 processor (Black Edition) on April 30, 2009, and submitted the results for validation to CPU-Z. During the process, the group used the Asus M4A79T Deluxe motherboard, dubbed as the Asus ‚Äúmultidimensional performance platform‚Äù featuring support for an AMD 140W CPU and the AMD 790FX/SB750 chipset. As a result, the group reached 7.127 GHz, beating the previous score of 6.7 GHz. Note that these extreme overclocks involve specialized equipment and are nowhere near what the average consumer could expect using traditional air cooling even with expensive third party cooling fans. For instance, maximum overclocking on a Phenom II X4 955 processor using a heatsink and fan is approximately 4 GHz.

He was born in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England. Biography Mark Cawthra's first serious musical activity was in an early (unnamed) music project with schoolfriend Tim Smith (bass guitar) and David Philpot (keyboards), a band in which he was the drummer. The music, a mix of jazz and rock, drew inspiration from the \\"Canterbury\\" bands, particularly Egg. After a period of playing drums with other musicians around Kingston upon Thames, he moved to North Yorkshire and lived there for the whole of 1978. He returned to London in 1979, following an invitation to join Tim and Jim Smith in Cardiac Arrest (replacing Peter Tagg on drums). Other members of the band at this time were Colvin Mayers (keyboards), (later to play with Adrian Borland in The Sound), and Mick Pugh (vocals). The Cardiac Arrest album The Obvious Identity was recorded at this time. Subsequently, he and Tim Smith recorded the band - now renamed Cardiacs \\\\- for a number of sessions in a small Surbiton studio. The results became the first Cardiacs album, Toy World. Following a short period in 1982 in which he was Cardiacs' keyboard player and percussionist, he left the band, moved to Birmingham and briefly worked with two of the remaining members of the Birmingham band Dangerous Girls, following their split. The line-up, calling itself TAAGA, produced one single, \\"Friend of Mine\\", working with UB40 producer by Bob Lamb. On returning to London, he worked for the remainder of the 1980s as crew member or live sound engineer, touring with several acts including Immaculate Fools, It's Immaterial, and Then Jerico. He was also Cardiacs front-of-house engineer at this time, and a member of the band Grown Ups with William D. Drake, Elaine Herman, Jon Bastable (The Trudy), Dominic Luckman and Craig Fortnam. Five tracks were recorded by this line-up but never released. From 1988, his work was based in and around Leeds, culminating in the building of a 48-track facility, That Studio Where he worked with This et al. producing demo material prior to the release of their Baby Machine album, and with the North Sea Radio Orchestra, mixing their first two albums. The studio was closed down in 2007. Today, his work is all studio-based, recording and mixing demos and masters in a new home facility in Leeds. Mixing credits include the Emmett Elvin albums \\"Bloody Marvels\\", \\"Assault On The Tyranny Of Reason\\" and \\"The End of Music\\", and the Gong album, Rejoice! I'm Dead!\\" working alongside Dave Sturt. His mastering credits in addition to the North Sea Radio Orchestra and Emmett Elvin albums, William D. Drake's second album, Briny Hooves, as well as releases by Local Girls, the post-Oceansize project British Theatre, Charlie Cawood, Knifeworld, and Khyam Allami's debut Resonance/Dissonance, the latter nominated for the 2012 Songlines music award. He contributed a track and compiled and mastered Leader Of The Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1, an album produced to gain funds for Tim Smith and his ongoing care, and raise awareness of his work. His first solo project Redbus Noface album #1 If It Fights The Hammer It will Fight The Knife was released on Believer's Roast in 2011. He compiled and mastered the Believers Roast Exquisite Corpse Game, a collection of contiguous fragments by various artists each of whom has only heard the closing 20 seconds of the previous section.

It is a Joint Program of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) and Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) and supported by Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). It is a one-year full-time residential MBA program with 36 weeks classroom interaction, case studies, tutorials, lab sessions, project work at IIMC, IITM and IITK; total of 1032 interaction hours. It also comprises 8 weeks internship in industry and 3 to 4 weeks industry visits in India and abroad. The aim of the program involves development of leadership and management skills together with cutting edge technology awareness and proficiency. This course (PGPEX-VLFM) is also jointly conducted by NITIE Mumbai and IIT Delhi.  History  Since 1991, the Indian economy is being progressively liberalized and its integration to the global economy is deepening. Growth of the manufacturing sector in the country has been recognized as a key thrust area by the Government of India. But with an increasingly competitive environment a need was felt to create a critical mass of visionary leaders to steer the manufacturing sector into the new era of excellence. Hence, VLMP was developed by the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council in collaboration with Ministry of HRD, IITs, IIMs and CII as a flagship program to develop Leaders in Manufacturing under the Indo- Japan Cooperation Agreement, signed by Honb‚Äôle Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India and His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, in December 2006. The Government of Japan had also agreed to extend cooperation to facilitate transfer of Japanese expertise and encourage visits to manufacturing centres of excellence in Japan so as to expose the budding leaders to the pioneers of manufacturing technology, adding a global perspective to the entire effort. The program was structured under the guidance of Professor Shoji Shiba, a renowned international expert in the manufacturing sector and a recipient of the Deming Prize. Prof. Shiba has been associated for more than a decade with the very successful Leaders for Global Operations (LGO), erstwhile LFM, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA. Since 2007, the program has crafted an array of visionary leaders who have marked their presence in industry, upholding the broad principles of the VLFM community.

Learning methods  The program's learning methods are an assortment of regular class discussions, case studies, group work, live presentations and action-learning opportunities like management games and short consultancy assignments. A significant proportion of the program is undertaken in teams to further enhance the dynamic learning experience.  Japan East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths  ‚ÄúJapan East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths‚Äú aka JENESYS, a multimillion-dollar initiative by the Japanese Government, created to promote solidarity among young generation of Asian countries. This unique opportunity to spend 10 days and experience the social life of the Japan brings the students closer to the Japanese culture. They experience both the urban and rural life and participate in various traditional activities like tea ceremony, ikebana and shamisen concert. The journey also includes a two-day Home Stay with a Japanese family in one of the many prefectures. = Tsunami restoration work = Parts of Japan saw the devastating effects of tsunami in 2011. Rikuzentakata was reported to have been \\"wiped off the map\\" by the tsunami following the Tohoku earthquake. The town's tsunami shelters were designed for a wave of three to four metres in height, but the tsunami of March 2011 created a wave 13 metres high which inundated the designated safe locations. Although the town was well prepared for earthquakes and tsunamis and had a seawall, it was not enough, and more than 80% of 8,000 houses were swept away. Through the JENESYS programme the VLM students had the opportunity to visit the site at Rikuzentakata, where they supported the tsunami restoration work. References 1\\\\.

Sometimes other ingredients are used as well, such as chocolate or raisins. It is a type of pastry commonly found in northern Germany, especially Hamburg, and it is usually served for breakfast, but is also enjoyed along with coffee and cake. As its name indicates, the Franzbr√∂tchen was probably inspired by French pastries. Originally, it could be found only in the region of Hamburg, but now Franzbr√∂tchen are also sold in Bremen, Berlin, and other German cities. Preparation The ingredients of the dough include flour, butter, yeast, milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. The filling is a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. Several times in succession, the dough is folded and rolled out thinly, and coated with butter. As soon as the dough is sufficiently outstretched to a filmy layer, it is moistened with a little water, sprinkled with a melange of sugar and cinnamon and finally rolled up. In order to provide the filled dough roll with the typical shape of a Franzbr√∂tchen, it has to be cut into slices, each about four centimetres thick. Afterwards, the pieces are pressed together in the middle of the cut faces with the handle of a wooden spoon, which causes the filling to ooze out sideways. On baking, the yeast dough rises and the melange of sugar and cinnamon is slightly caramelized on the outside of the layers. Due to the butter and the caramelized sugar, the Franzbr√∂tchen is often a little sticky. Variants of the Franzbr√∂tchen may contain raisins, seeds, chocolate sprinkles or pumpkin seeds. Origin The Franzbr√∂tchen was probably named in the style of the French (German 'franz√∂sisch') model, the croissant, which is also made of pastry and became popular in Germany after Napoleon's troops had occupied Hamburg between 1806 and 1814. According to a different historical tradition, they produced a longish Franzbrot (German for 'French bread') which resembled the baguette. Legend has it, a baker in Hamburg had once seared such a Franzbrot in a pan of fat, which is considered the origin of the contemporary Franzbr√∂tchen.

The other two works that belong to this trilogy are the Chamber Concerto (1983/4) and Venexiana (1985), which Powers both references in this piece, thus linking them thematically.Description of Stone, Water, Stars on the OUP website. (accessed 14 November 2014). The Concerto for Cello (1990) was commissioned for the King's Lynn Festival, specifically written for the cellist Stephen Isserlis and dedicated to the artistic adviser of the festival, Meirion Bowen.Description of Concerto for Cello on the OUP website (accessed 14 November 2014). The concerto is in three movements with a prominent piano piece in the opening passage of the work. Although some of the writing for the soloist and orchestra is at times quite turbulent, a number of critics have commented on the \\"reflective\\" nature of the piece. The Concerto for Horn (1989) was written for the horn player Michael Thompson and included two movements; 'Madrigals of Love and War' and 'Winter Journeys'.Description of Concerto for Horn on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). The theme was similar to his previous work, and was described by John Warnaby as, 'an element of conflict [that] is gradually superseded by affirmative lyricism'. It was influenced by Powers' visits to Czechoslovakia in 1986 and 1988 Powers explains that; ‚ÄòThe concerto seemed to be, on one level at least, a history, in music, of Czechoslovakia from 1968 to 1989'. Anthony Powers' Symphony was written between 1994 and 1996, although he did not necessarily set out to write one. As it was appearing to become a full orchestral work, Powers received assistance from the David James Music Trust to complete it.Description of Symphony on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). It was dedicated to his parents while Andrew Burn noted how it demonstrated 'mastery of extended large-scale structures', and Nicholas Jones commented on the 'evident assuredness of Powers's handling of the symphonic genre'. Between 1998-99 the composer completed his Symphony No. 2 which was first performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 2002.Description of Symphony No. 2 on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014).  Vocal/Choral  A Picture of the World (2001) was commissioned by the BBC and is a setting of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, following in the footsteps of his mentor Elisabeth Lutyens.Description of A Picture of the World on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). Powers explained the use of a counter- tenor as 'Wittgenstein had an unusually high speaking voice' with the vocal and clarinet acting as the voice of the philosopher. The piece was premiered at Warsaw Autumn Festival and broadcast on Radio 3, while in the Guardian, Harry Eyres commented on the unusual instrumentation of the piece. Airs and Angels (2003) was commissioned for the Three Choirs Festival held in Hereford in 2003 and was a interpretation of seven of John Donne‚Äôs (1572‚Äì1631) poems.Description of Airs and Angels on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). At the work‚Äôs centre lies the ‚Äòdark and intense‚Äô setting of 'A Nocturnal Upon St. Lucy's Day', while the Guardian described the work as a'striking setting of [the] love poems by John Donne, conceived in seven sections that merge imperceptibly into a continuous arching sequence'. From Station Island (2003) is an abridged interpretation of a poetry collection of the same name by Seamus Heaney, where the composer reworked and edited nine poems into an narrative that included a male speaker, baritone and a small ensemble where the former has the role of the poet and the baritone acts out numerous characters.Description of From Station Island on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). At the West Cork Music Festival in Ireland in June 2005, the work received its Irish premiere and the male speaker role was performed by Seamus Heaney himself.Review from the Irish Times (30 June 2005). Others include Lullaby (1991), Lullo by Lollo (1993) and O Magnum Mysterium (1995).  Chamber music  Another Part of the Island (1980, revised in 1994) is a chamber work in four movements that as premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London in May 1982 and conducted by John Carewe. The piece refers to the imaginary island from Shakespeare's The Tempest, where the instruments can be seen as playing characters from the play.Description of Another Part of the Island on the OUP website, (accessed 15 November 2014). His chamber works include a number of solo works, for example: * Nocturnes: book 2 (1984) - cello * Barcarola (1987) - viola * In Two Minds (1991) - oboe * Nature Studies (1992) - guitar Other chamber works include: four string quartets (1987, 1991, 1999, 2005), Nymph√©as (1983), Capricci; In Shadow (1989), In Sunlight (1993) and Fast Colours (1997).Listing of chamber and orchestral works on the OUP website.  Piano  Powers has written a number of works for piano, including Flyer (2004), Piano Sonata No. 1 (1983), Piano Sonata No. 2 (1986) and Sensing (2003). However, the best known of his piano works is The Memory Room (1990/1) written for and dedicated to William Howard, who premiered the piece at the Lichfield Festival on 10 July 1992. In contrast to previous work, it consists of sixteen short pieces.Details on the William Howard collaboration at record company website. Nicholas Jones pointed out that Powers integrates these keyboard styles into his own style so effectively that 'they are mere ghosts or shadows of their former selves'. In 2003, Powers wrote a second piece for Howard, entitled Vista, and Powers explains that Vista was the first piece in a planned sequence of pieces all reflecting on or interpreting 'aspects of Italian renaissance and baroque gardens.'

A. G. Hungerford, was an Australian writer, noted for his World War II novel The Ridge and the River, and his short stories that chronicle growing up in South Perth, Western Australia during the Great Depression. Early life Hungerford was born in Perth, Western Australia on 5 May 1915. He grew up in South Perth, known then as the Queen Suburb, when the area was semi-rural, with market gardens. World War Two Hungerford served with the Australian Army in Darwin, New Guinea, Bougainville, Morotai and with the Occupation Forces in Japan. He was a sergeant in 2/8 Australian Commando Squadron. In 2005 the ABC's 7.30 Report reported his \\"unflinching depictions of jungle fighting are acknowledged as some of the best writing to come out of the war\\". Hungerford told the program he wasn't a hero: \\"I was one of a group of men all doing the same bloody thing. Sticking the head up, hoping to Christ it wouldn't be shot off.\\" He left the army in 1947. Journalism After the war, Hungerford was a press secretary for Billy Hughes for three weeks. Upon leaving, Hungerford wrote to Hughes: \\"I will never work for you again. I'd rather go to bed with a sabre-toothed tiger\\".Aneurin Hughes, Billy Hughes: Prime Minister and Controversial Founding Father of the Australian Labor Party, Wiley, 2005. He then joined the Australia News and Information Bureau, and afterwards was a freelancer. He later worked as a press secretary to Western Australian Premiers John Tonkin and Sir Charles Court. Writing Hungerford began writing as a teenager and had his first published short story in 1942 in the Sydney Bulletin. His first volume of short fiction, Stories from Suburban Road, depict life during the Great Depression in the Perth riverside suburb of South Perth.

History  Construction of the Southern railway line from Toowoomba to Warwick brought it as far as Dalrymple Creek near Allora in 1869. At that time, Allora was the largest settlement in the region but the line ran about five kilometres to its west and the then terminus was renamed Hendon in the 1870s.\\"Triumph of Narrow Gauge: A History of Queensland Railways\\" by John Kerr 1990 Boolarong Press, Brisbane A line from Hendon to Allora was surveyed in 1884 but the local residents pushed for connection to a proposed direct link between Brisbane and Warwick. The latter link did not materialise but a line running the short distance from Hendon to Allora was constructed and opened on 21 April 1897. Up to four trains daily connected via Kates with the main line services at Hendon. After development of land to the east of Allora, moves were afoot to extend the line about 20 kilometres to Goomburra. Approved in 1910, construction of the extension commenced in 1911 and opened on 8 July 1912. Stops were located at Kital, Berat and Kunda. The Goomburra extension was constructed from a point a short distance down from Allora station, turning Allora station and yard into a short spur. Traffic from Allora to Goomburra or vice versa was required to perform a back shunt. In addition to passenger traffic, freight carried on the Goomburra line included dairy products, timber and seasonal grain but its justification did not last. The section of the line beyond Allora was closed on 30 June 1961 due to increasing competition from road transport. Service on the Hendon to Allora section was suspended in 1995. The Hendon to Allora section is now owned by the Southern Downs Steam Railway, a rail heritage organisation based in Warwick which intends to run tourist steam trains on this section.

It was established with the name Centro de Aperfei√ßoamento de Economistas (Economist Improvement Center ‚Äì CAE), where Bachelors of Economics prepared to take master's and doctoral programs abroad. In January, 1966, CAE became known as EPGE, with the introduction of its master's graduate program. Eight years later, in 1974, the Doctoral program was created. EPGE has been given the highest grade assigned by the Ministry of Education's Higher Learning Personnel Development Coordination (CAPES) to graduate Economics programs in Brazil.  The Graduate School of Economics of Getulio Vargas Foundation  The mission of the Getulio Vargas Foundation Graduate School of Economics (FGV/EPGE) is enlarging human knowledge and contributing to solving the world's - Brazil's in particular - economic and socioeconomic problems. The School pursues such objectives by trying to offer the highest possible level of education backed by state-of-the-art faculty research. Since its inception, in 1961, the FGV/EPGE has taught the elite of Brazilian economists. Through its faculty and alumni, it has added to the conduction of macro and microeconomic policies aimed at fighting poverty, taming inflation and enhancing economic development. Faculty publications in top professional journals, mostly after the mid-1990s, have been frequent and always increasing. Faculty members are devoted to full-time research and invited to teach and present the results of their scientific investigations in the best departments of business and economics around the world. The School confers Undergraduate, Master and Doctoral degrees in Economics. It also publishes the Revista Brasileira de Economia, the oldest and most prestigious academic economic periodic in Brazil. After 50 years dedicated to its main objectives, as described above, it is fair to say that EPGE has so far fulfilled its predicted mission. FGV/EPGE has graduated several high-office public officials, including Ministers of State; Governors of States; Presidents and Directors of the Brazilian Central Bank, as well as directors and CEOs of the most dominant and prestigious private enterprises in Brazil and abroad. Academically, the Tilburg International Ranking of Departments of Economics ranks FGV/EPGE since 2011 as the best school of Economics in Latin America. Moreover, 2011 reports from the Brazilian Ministry of Education have elected both the undergraduate and the post-graduate programs of FGV/EPGE as the best ones offered in Brazil.  Stricto Sensu Graduate Programs  The school offers three strict graduate programs: doctor of Economics, master of Economics and master of Finance and Business Economics. The two former are strictly academic, and the latter is professional. The master of Economics program aims students interested in applied education in Economics. The course is intended for students who plan to dedicate to academia, as well as for private and public sector professionals. A doctorate is an extension of the master's program, with new topics incorporated and higher demand levels. The Master of Finance and Business Economics program was launched in 2002. Its target audience lies in private and public sector managers. MFEE can be taken in parallel with the performance of professional tasks.  Undergraduate and Lato Sensu Graduate Programs  EPGE launched its undergraduate Economics program since 2002, through the Brazilian School of Economics and Finance. This program teaches some basic knowledge of Human and Social Sciences. In addition to these courses, EPGE also takes part in broad graduate programs in cooperation with the FGV Educational Development Institute. Also known as specialization courses, these programs is intended so develop skills in the areas of Administration, Marketing, Management and Logistics, Finance, Quality, Law, and Sales.

UNDERWOOD, CRIMSON STAFF WRITERJoin the Impact presents at Occupy Chicago teach-in, Phoenix Weekend, by Joseph Duggan Lyons on February 26, 2012 The website for the group was established November 7, 2008 after founders Amy Balliett and Willow Witte decided to utilize a website to try to galvanize attention for the cause. The level of success the two women had orchestrating a nationwide protest only a week later, may have benefited from the recent historical success the Obama campaign had with the medium. Join the Impact held November 15, 2008 anti-Proposition 8 protests against the California State proposition in every state in the U.S. The group's website claims that hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered that day with as many as 10,000 in NYC alone. Facebook played a pivotal role in organizing, allowing headquarters for events to form, and communicate with participants locally. Additionally, the use of sites like Facebook prevented the website failures that happened early on due to the high numbers of users accessing the site. Despite given larger and larger server for free from Hostdango the site continued to crash. Wetpaint, a free website wiki community, offered to allow the group to develop a site page for each state. Not long after the Wetpaint website became online, another site powered by Wetpaint was created in opposition of the site. The site, ProtectMarriage.wetpaint.com, encouraged people to join protests against same- sex marriage. Join the Impact organized a National Day of Protest on November 15, 2008. The protest took place in over 400 cities in every state in the country and in ten countries around the world. The protest was attended by an estimated one million people worldwide. Join the Impact also helped organize Day Without a Gay on December 10, 2008. The event encouraged same sex marriage supporters to call in to work \\"gay\\" and do community service in their communities. Many also participated in an economic boycott that day by not spending any money. On December 20, 2008, Join the Impact organized Light Up The Night For Equality and the National LGBT Food Drive for Equality in cities across the country. Candlelight vigils were held in commercial centers and shopping malls in remembrance of the 18,000 same sex marriages performed in California between June and November 2008. An estimated one million people were educated about five rights not afforded to one in ten citizens simply because they were gay. The event garnered national attention, even the attention of the Westboro Baptist Church, who held a counter protest at the Light Up the Night for Equality vigil in Chicago, IL. The event had pre and post event promotion from Equality California,The Human Rights Campaign, Courage Campaign, Marriage Equality USA MEUSA, LOGO,365Gay.com, Students for Equality, LezGetReal, and many other amazing organizations and groups. There was a National DOMA Protest on January 10, 2009. The protest brought together signatures on a letter to President-Elect Barack Obama about his promises to the LGBT community. Join the Impact promised to deliver those signatures and letters to President Obama on January 21, 2009.

It can be found on California Street of Huntington Park at the top of Nob Hill in San Francisco. It was donated to the city by Mrs. James Flood in 1942 and is owned by the San Francisco Arts Commission. The sculpture features three nude children with a ribbon draped around them. They are holding hands and dancing in a circle. *J.C. Nichols Memorial Fountain is located at Emanuel Cleaver II Blvd and JC Nichols Pkwy at the east entrance of the popular Country Club Plaza district in Kansas City, Missouri. The fountain is the most famous and most- photographed fountain in Kansas City. The four equestrian statues were sculpted in 1910 to adorn the Harbor Hill mansion of Clarence Mackay, an American financier, in Long Island, New York. The fountain was vandalized and parts of it went missing. In 1951, the Nichols family initiated the purchase and installation of the fountain, which was funded by not only the family, but also Kansas City as well as private contributions including a collection by Kansas City area school children. It was refurbished by Herman Frederick Simon and dedicated in 1960 as the J. C. Nichols Memorial Fountain. It has four heroic horsemen that represent the four mighty rivers: the Mississippi River (fighting an alligator), the Seine, the Rhine, and the Volga River (with the bear). In 2014, the fountain underwent an extensive renovation funded by the Miller Nichols Charitable Foundation.

Biography  Born in 1929 in Suzhou, China, James Helme Sutcliffe escaped in 1941 after the Japanese attack on China with his parents to Australia. He received his first musical education (piano, viola and music theory) at Geelong College from George Logie-Smith and later at Melbourne University Conservatorium of Music from Roy Shepherd. After moving to the United States he studied piano and composition at Juilliard School in New York (Bachelor of Science Degree in May 1953) and at Eastman School of Music. For four years he taught at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and went then to Europe where he continued his studies as r√©p√©titeur at the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich, in Bayreuth and in K√∂ln (Cologne). Since 1963 he lived in Berlin and worked among his activities as composer, teacher for piano, composition and music theory foremost as a music critic for the International Herald Tribune as soon as for many important opera magazines like Opera Magazine, Opera News, Opera Canada, Musical America and Opernwelt. His works were performed by musicians like Alexander Frey, Steven Isserlis and Wolfgang Boettcher. His \\"Academic Festival March\\", is the alma mater of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Dr. Loy Witherspoon, professor of religious studies, commissioned the March in 1965 when he learned that Charlotte College would become a campus in the University of North Carolina system. The March was first performed in 1967 at the installation of Dean W. Colvard as UNC Charlotte's first chancellor. Afterwards, it was performed as a recessional at every Commencement during Dean W. Colvard's as chancellor. When UNC Charlotte founder Bonnie Cone heard the March, she said, \\"I can hear an alma mater in it,\\" referring to a hymn- like refrain. Dr. Robert Rieke, a professor of history, also heard an alma mater in it. On a 1990 trip to Germany, Rieke visited Sutcliffe, picked up a recording of the March, and began writing words to fit the final refrain. On Christmas Eve 1991, he sent Bonnie Cone the words and music as a Christmas present to her and to the university, from which he had retired a year earlier. Chancellor James. H. Woodward approved the composition as the university's Alma Mater in April 1992. It was sung for the first time at the following May Commencement and has been performed at every Commencement since.

Wilhelm Schmidt was born in Wegeleben in the Prussian Province of Saxony on 18 February 1858.  Education  At school Wilhelm Schmidt had difficulties with reading, writing and arithmetic, a case of dyslexia. For example, he was unable to recite the alphabet without hesitation all his life. Nor could he memorise poetry or prose.Martin Haug: Die einen guten Kampf gek√§mpft. Lebensbilder deutscher M√§nner. 11th edn. Calver Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978, , p. 210 He developed a passion for drawing, however, and for machines.Martin Haug: Die einen guten Kampf gek√§mpft. Lebensbilder deutscher M√§nner. 11th edn. Calver Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978, , p. 212  Career  Diagram of Schmidt superheater Schmidt began his professional career as a machine fitter. He studied at the technical high school in Dresden under Gustav Zeuner.  Superheated steam  In 1883 he took a post as a civil engineer in Kassel, where he developed superheated steam technology to the point where it could be practically used. In 1908 he transferred his home and the base of his firm to Benneckenstein in the Harz. He was not the first person to work with superheated steam, but his predecessors had only used steam temperatures up to 250 ¬∞C; Schmidt was the first to risk increasing this to 350 ¬∞C.  Schmidt Superheated Steam Company  For further trials with superheated steam on the Ilsenburg ‚Äì Wernigerode railway, there was a trials organisation near Wernigerode station. It was here that Schmidt founded the Schmidt Superheated Steam Company (Schmidtsche Heissdampfgesellschaft). By using superheated steam the thermal efficiency of a steam engine could be raised by as much as 50%. This technology had a substantial influence on the development of the steam locomotive and steamship, as well as all other applications where steam engines were used. Schmidt also invented other items, such as the superheater (around 1890) and the piston valve, which he developed together with Robert Garbe of the Prussian state railways.  ALSTOM Power Energy Recovery  Even today, his successor company - Schmidt'schen Heissdampf GmbH, survives under the name of ALSTOM Power Energy Recovery GmbH, in Kassel-Bettenhausen. It develops and builds apparatus for the processes involving the transfer of heat in the petrochemical, chemical and metallurgical industries, e.g. cracked gas coolers for the manufacture of ethylene, gas coolers for the manufacture of methanol, ammonia and hydrogen and a multitude of equipment for special purposes. The company continues to be highly innovative and a market leader in its field. Religious views Schmidt viewed his inventions however as rather unimportant in view of \\"a world which is badly lost\\". He held a strong faith and distributed Warning Cry to the People (Mahnrufe an das Volk) from Bethel, near Bielefeld. He was friends with Friedrich von Bodelschwingh. He held the view that Anglo-Saxon Christianity had weakened German Christianity.Entry in √ñkumenischen Heiligenlexikon He died on 16 February 1924 in Bethel.

The community lies at the crossroads of U.S. 90 and Alabama State Route 181 just south and north of I-10. Portions of the settlement are today within the city limits of Daphne. The incorporated city of Loxley lies to the east, and Spanish Fort to the north. Malbis is considered a community or populated place but is not identified in the United States Census. It is part of the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley Micropolitan Statistical Area. The Malbis Plantation was inducted into the National Register of Historic Places in May 2011. History Malbis Memorial Church, built in honor of Jason Malbis Known originally as the Malbis Plantation, the settlement was founded in 1906 by Jason Malbis. Malbis was a Greek philanthropist born in Doumena, Greece as Antonius Markopoulos. Malbis had been an Orthodox monk before coming to the United States to investigate the condition of fellow Greeks who had immigrated to the US. He changed his name to Jason Malbis and migrated south to Alabama. While traveling through Alabama, Malbis became enamored with Baldwin County and purchased the land that would become the Greek colony. The community was populated for many years mostly by those of either secular or religious Greek heritage. The Malbis Memorial Church, a Greek Orthodox church, was built by the settlers and still stands today. The community once included the Malbis Bakery, an ice plant, plant nursery, cannery, hotels, restaurants, its own power plant, turpentine, dairy, lumber, water towers and many acres of farmland. During the peak of the colony's success, the economy was largely based upon providing table food to nearby Mobile, Alabama. Much of the land was sold for commercial development, including a soybean field, which is currently covered by a large retail shopping mall.

She co-presents the Channel 4 daytime puzzle show Countdown and its comedy spin-off 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. A mathematics graduate, her television debut came when she joined Countdown aged 22. With an interest in popularising mathematics and the sciences, she has since co-presented The Gadget Show on Channel 5 (2013‚Äì14) and It's Not Rocket Science on ITV (2016). She was also a contestant on the BBC celebrity dance show Strictly Come Dancing in 2013.

Retrieved 31 December 2013 she identifies as Jewish, saying: \\"My family came over in the pogroms.\\" Riley was raised in the Thorpe Bay area of Southend-on-Sea and was educated at the independent Thorpe Hall School, and Southend High School for Girls, a grammar school, where she obtained four As at A-Level. She then completed undergraduate studies in mathematics at Oriel College, Oxford.She then completed a Master of Arts degree. Riley's nickname at university was, she revealed on crystal maze, the 'angry chav'. During a university vacation, Riley considered a career in the financial sector, and completed an internship at Deutsche Bank in the City of London. The experience put her off; she found the extreme behaviour of city traders wearing, and she disliked the early morning train commute.Rachel Riley: 'Strictly magnified the fault lines in my marriage' Daily Telegraph, 18 June 2014. Retrieved 20 June 2014. Television career Riley's television debut came in January 2009, when at the age of 22 she joined the Channel 4 letters and numbers game show Countdown. Riley had received no training for working in television and had no other experience with the media industry, leading to descriptions of her landing this role as a baptism of fire, given its status as a \\"jewel in the broadcasting crown\\", according to one media commentator. She later branched out into other roles, co-presenting 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and The Gadget Show although her profile was significantly boosted by her appearance as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, which \\"catapulted [Riley] onto the A-list\\" and opened up the doors for new television roles, according to another commentator. In 2014, two years before her role on It's Not Rocket Science, she said, \\"I'd love to present a popular science programme because it's something I feel very passionate about.\\"  Countdown  On Countdown, Riley replaced the long-serving Carol Vorderman. Like Vorderman, Riley's role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers rounds if the contestants are unable to do so. Riley's appointment to Countdown was announced at the same time as the announcement of a new main host, Jeff Stelling, replacing Des O'Connor; the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January 2009. Although she had no ambition to be a television presenter, she was encouraged to apply by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten 1,000 applicants for the role, she commented, \\"There's only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I'm absolutely thrilled\\". Riley takes the role of solving the numbers round so seriously that if she cannot solve it on the show, she takes it away with her to finish, commenting \\"I'm really OCD about it. I have to get it. I like puzzles ‚Äì that's what I do, that's why I applied for the job, that's why I used to watch Countdown when I was younger. I like solving stuff.\\" She has attributed this compulsion to a nervy and flustered start in the role which resulted in her making some errors, although she says she has since got the hang of it and the task is now a matter of routine. In contrast, on account of her \\"really immature sense of humour\\" she has some difficulty in maintaining her composure during the words round whenever rude words appear. Riley frequently encounters close media and public scrutiny of what she wears on the show, with her wardrobe choices attracting intense social media comment on Twitter and YouTube and even national headlines. Working with a wardrobe consultant, she obtains most of the clothes from High Street stores, although some are purchased from a small boutique near her home in Southend. While trying to please everybody with varied choices, she nonetheless takes a phlegmatic approach to the attention, commenting, \\"even with the same outfit you'll get polar-opposite views, so you can't win. You‚Äôve just got to learn that you can't please everyone all of the time\\". The number of episodes means wearing some outfits more than once is inevitable‚Äîshe donates items she no longer requires to charity, some being auctioned by her mother. On 11 January 2019, Riley celebrated ten years of being on Countdown. To mark the occasion she showcased some of the ruder words that she has come across during her time on the show.  8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown  Since it was first broadcast on 2 January 2012, Riley has also performed her Countdown role on the comedy crossover spin-off version, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, alongside comedian Jimmy Carr as host. While Countdown is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the difference between the two, Riley sees Countdown as the role she is happy for her grandmother to see, while Cats Does Countdown is the more risqu√©, cheeky role which she shows to her friends. Some of the running gags used on the show are made by Carr at Riley's expense, aimed at her lack of dancing ability and a supposed frosty relationship with Vorderman, while in return Riley is often given jokes which mock Carr's supposed desires on herself and his tax avoidance. Due to scheduling conflicts with filming for It's Not Rocket Science, Riley was replaced by Claudia Winkleman for two episodes in series nine (broadcast 3 and 10 March 2016). Strictly Come Dancing From September 2013, Riley appeared in the eleventh series of the BBC One ballroom dancing programme Strictly Come Dancing with professional dancing partner Pasha Kovalev. She was eliminated in week 6 of the show, on 3 November, after losing out in the dance-off against Abbey Clancy and Alja≈æ ≈†korjanec, who went on to win the series. According to Riley she lacked a natural talent for performing, so instead sought to frame each dance as that of a character. For the first five weeks, Riley suffered from stage fright, commenting that \\"As soon as the music would start, I would have a fuzzy brain and it was like an out-of-body experience\\"; after seeing a cognitive behavioural therapist she was able to control her breathing, and so was only able to truly enjoy the show for what proved to be her final appearance.  The Gadget Show  From 2013 until 2014, Riley co-presented on the Channel 5 programme The Gadget Show with Jason Bradbury. She presented three series of the show and was later replaced by Amy Williams.The Gadget Show‚Äôs new presenter is an Olympic champion!  It's Not Rocket Science  In 2016, Riley was part of the three-person presenting team for ITV's six-part series, It's Not Rocket Science, billed by the network as an entertainment series celebrating science. Her co-presenters, Ben Miller and Romesh Ranganathan, similarly had a background in science and maths. Explaining the purpose of the show as popularising science and making it seem less intimidating, she said \\"It's showing that you can't separate the world of science from the world we live in\\". She added that while her background is in mathematics, \\"You can't separate them either. Maths is the language of science.\\" A key part of the show was a weekly challenge where one of the presenters \\"risked their lives\\" to prove a scientific theory ‚Äì in Riley's case she cycled on a tightrope and zip-lined through a ring of fire. Sky Sports In August 2016, it was announced that Riley would join Sky Sports to present Friday Night Football alongside her former Countdown co-presenter Jeff Stelling and Fantasy Football Club with Max Rushden and Paul Merson.Unbelievable Jeff! Rachel Riley joins Sky Sports She left Friday Night Football in 2017. Personal life  In August 2012, Riley married Jamie Gilbert, whom she had met while they were both studying at the University of Oxford. It was announced in November 2013 that they were separating. The split has been cited as an example of the Strictly curse. She began dating her Strictly dance partner, Pasha Kovalev, soon after the show ended in December 2013. In May 2019, Riley announced that she was pregnant with the couple's first child. In June 2019, Riley and Kovalev married in Las Vegas. On 15 December 2019, Riley gave birth to a daughter, Maven Aria. Riley is a keen supporter of Manchester United, like her father who was originally from Salford.Me a sex symbol? It just doesn‚Äôt add up, says Rachel Riley Southend Echo, 22 January 2013. Retrieved 11 January 2013. In October 2010, Riley presented a programme on the club's television channel, MUTV, featuring a tour of their Trafford Training Centre in Carrington. She has also hosted episodes of An Audience with... on the channel. To mark her 1,000th episode of Countdown (aired on 25 June 2013), United player Ryan Giggs presented her with a signed team shirt, Giggs himself having celebrated his 1,000th game for the club the same year.Ryan Giggs to appear on Rachel Riley's 1,000th 'Countdown' episode ‚Äì TV News ‚Äì Digital Spy In her appearance as a contestant on the BBC quiz show Celebrity Mastermind, broadcast on 4 January 2012, her specialist subject was a limited (13 year) history of the club; she eventually finished in joint second place. In 2017, she was the co-winner with Idris Elba of the Rear of the Year award.  Antisemitism campaign  Riley identifies herself as of Jewish heritage and as an atheist. Since 2018, she has campaigned against the way the Labour Party has handled allegations of antisemitism. She said she decided to speak out after seeing \\"Israel is a racist endeavour\\" posters on London bus stops. In September 2018, after criticising Jeremy Corbyn over the ongoing antisemitism row, she stated she did not have \\"any party loyalties\\". In January 2019, Riley made a speech at a Westminster reception for the Holocaust Educational Trust and addressed what she described as the \\"hideous abuse\\" she had received. In Jewish News, Riley was quoted: > In the name of Labour I've been called a hypocrite, lying propagandist, a > tits-teeth-and-arse clothes horse dolly bird, weaponiser of anti-Semitism, > fascist, right-wing extremist, Nazi sympathiser, Twitter cancer, thick Tory, > brainwashed, an anti-Semite, white supremacist, hate preacher, Zio political > trollster, not a real Jew, a child bully, conspiracy theorist, a paedo- > protector minion puppet who my dead grandfather would be disgusted by. In February 2019, Riley and fellow campaigner Tracy Ann Oberman instructed a lawyer to take action against 70 individuals who had shared a critical blogpost for libel or harassment. In May 2019, a High Court judge ruled the post defamatory but in July 2020 Riley and Oberman dropped the libel action. At the withdrawal of the action the defendant stated: \\"Ultimately, despite press reports which suggested as many as 70 people might face legal action, I was the only person who was sued.\\" Oberman and Riley agreed to contribute towards the defendant's legal costs. In February 2019, it was reported that she had been involved in talks to set up a breakaway Labour party. According to Jewish News in April 2019, Riley backed the Stop Funding Fake News campaign. In July 2019, the Durham Miners' Association called a tweet from Riley \\"damaging\\" after she said that playing an Israeli folk song, \\"Hava Nagila\\", at the Durham Miners' Gala was \\"as tasteful as showing Black Panther at a Klan rally\\". According to the association, the tune had been played by a community brass band at the gala for many years. They said she had caused \\"great hurt to good people\\" with her comments. In November 2019, Riley posted an image on Twitter of herself wearing a shirt with an edited image of Jeremy Corbyn carrying a sign bearing the caption \\"Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour\\". The tweet was condemned by some for erasing the struggle against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa, the original subject of the sign, to make a political point, with some users calling for Riley to be fired. The professional photographer who took the original shot, Rob Scott, also publicly declared his displeasure, stating she had \\"illegally manipulated and printed\\" the picture to \\"cynically promote her agenda\\", adding \\"I am appalled by the abuse of property, moral rights and change of anti-racist message to anti- Corbyn one.\\" Other work Riley's mathematics background and love of football has seen her assist bookmakers in preparing betting odds for football tournaments; based on her analysis she predicted Chile would win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, despite appreciating fans would see it as an unlikely outcome (Chile was ultimately knocked out in the Round of 16). Riley has visited schools to enthuse pupils on the \\"joys of applied maths, quantum mechanics and time travel and so on\\". A blog, written by University of Surrey academic Julia Percival and hosted by The Guardian, which argued that Riley's looks and figure would work against any aim to increase female participation in the sciences, was described by The Daily Telegraph as unfair and a case of Riley being damned if she did and damned if she didn't. In June 2019, Riley was criticised by environmental groups and accused of greenwashing for her promotion of the \\"future energy solutions\\" of Shell.

Motivation The second palatalization of velars is a direct consequence of the monophthongization of diphthongs, or more precisely, the change *aj > ƒì.Mihaljeviƒá 2002:157 While *kaj, *gaj and *xaj were in accordance with the principle of so-called intrasyllabic synharmony that operated during the Common Slavic period, the resulting *kƒì, *gƒì, and *xƒì defied the intrasyllabic synharmony since the velars ended up in front of the resulting front vowel ƒì, which itself gainsaid the Proto-Slavic phonotactical constraints. This anomaly was resolved by palatalizing the velars, just as it was done during the first palatalization. However, the results of the second palatalization were different and not completely uniform across Slavic territory, indicating one of the first dialectal differences. Usually, this palatalization is described as gradual, with fronting to proper palatals occurring first and then (perhaps with those that were affected with the third palatalization) assibilation. Hence it is sometimes called sibilantization. In addition, the same process operated before the new instances of *i deriving from *oj. Formulation The inherited velars *k (< PIE *k, *) and *g (< PIE *g, *, *, *) change before the Proto-Slavic diphthong *aj/ƒÅj (< PIE *oy, */ay), which itself must have become *ƒì by the time the second palatalization started to occur:Matasoviƒá 2008:143 : *k > *t > c : '*g > *d > dz > z Proto- Slavic velar fricative *x that was absent in PIE, and which arose primarily from PIE *s by means of RUKI law, from word-initial PIE #sk- as well as from Germanic and Iranian borrowings, changed in the same environment as: : *x > *≈õ > s/≈° The ultimate output of the third palatalization is thus the same as that of the preceding second palatalization. The difference of the palatalization of *x is dependent upon chronology and the Slavic dialect in question: In East and South Slavic it is /s/, and in West Slavic languages it is /≈°/. Slovak tends to match South Slavic in such instances, e.g. ƒåech \\"Czech\\", plural ƒåesi \\"Czechs\\". Compare: * PIE *koylo- > PSl. *kajlu 'whole, healthy' > OCS cƒõl—ä, Russ. c√©lyj, Pol. ca≈Çy The intermediary /dz/ has been preserved only in the oldest Old Church Slavonic canon monuments, Lechitic languages, Slovak and the Ohrid dialects of Macedonian. Other Slavic languages have younger /z/. Second palatalization alternates s consonant clusters specifically {  + Consonant alternations resulting from Proto-Slavic palatalizations - ! colspan=\\"1\\"Velar  align=center  /sk/  align=center  /zg/  align=center  /sx/ - !colspan=\\"1\\"Dental  align=center  /sc/, /st/  align=center  /zd/  align=center  /sc/ } In South Slavic languages the second palatalization operates even if medial *w (> OCS v) is present between the velar and the diphthong (or its reflex), whereas in West Slavic languages the original *kvƒõ/gvƒõ clusters are preserved.Kapoviƒá 2008:169 Although words with groups cv, zv resulting from the second palatalization are found in East Slavic languages, they are likely to be a consequence of the Church Slavonic influence, since there is evidence of preservation of the original groups in Ukrainian and Belarusian and in some Russian dialects. Compare: * PSl. *gwajzdƒÅ 'star' > OCS zvƒõzda, but Pol. gwiazda, Cz. hvƒõzda * PSl. *kwajtu 'flower' > OCS cvƒõt—ä, but Pol. kwiat, Cz. kvƒõt, Ukr. kvitka, Belarus. kvetka, Russ. dial. kvet In natively coined and inherited Slavic words, the second palatalization occurs only before the new *ƒõ < *aj because the first palatalization already operated before all the other front vowels, but in loanwords, it operates before all front vowels. Compare: * Latin acƒìtum 'vinegar' > Goth. akit- > PSl. *akitu > OCS oc—åt—ä * Germanic *kirik≈ç 'church' > PSl. *kirk≈´ > OCS cr—åky Interpretation The second palatalization probably spread from the south of the Slavic speech area; it started to operate sometime between the end of the sixth and the middle of the seventh century AD, and the environments in which it operated varied. In Russian, Slovak and (in nouns) Slovene, the results of the second palatalization were later removed at morpheme boundaries (i.e. before inflectional endings) due to paradigmatic leveling by analogy. In Ukrainian and Belarusian, however, the effects of second palatalization are still evident in such cases. Compare: * Old East Slavic ruka 'hand', L. rucƒõ ** Russ. ruk√°, L. ruk√© ** Ukr. ruk√°, L. ruc√≠ ** Belarus. ruk√°, L. ruc√© For Northwest Russian varieties (Novgorod, Pskov), according to Zaliznyak, the second palatalization did not take place at all (E.g. Pskovian kev : OESl. cƒõv—å: Old Novgorod *kƒõl—ä : OCS cƒõl—ä). According to others, however, such apparent unchanged velars were actually palatalized dentals both in the older monuments and in the modern varieties (so such #k- would in fact be [t']). So the only exception with these varieties would be the non-occurrence of the affrication normally brought on by the second palatalization.

Doctoral dissertation on a research program in early modern physics with reference to the work of the Dutch 17th-century physicist, mathematician and astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Has been guest researcher at the Collegium Helveticum of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z√ºrich, and a Fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences (SCASSS), Uppsala University. Writing Elzinga has written on science policy from both a conceptual-critical and a practical point of view. Introduced (in 1985) the concept of \\"epistemic drift\\". The latter denotes a shift from emphasis on internal quality control to external relevance assessments of research in contexts of strong political and commercial pressures. Analysis builds on studies regarding tensions existing between objectivity and partisanship in research as a human activity and its forms of institutionalization in society. A recent book (2006) was on Albert Einstein's bestowal of the Nobel prize. Elzinga combines history, philosophy, and the politics of science, giving science policy studies a broader, reflexive and more critical framework. Together with Andrew Jamison (1995) written on the concept of \\"policy cultures\\", referring to goals and norms associated with four different types of stakeholder groups - academic, commercial, bureaucratic and civil society. Critical studies on the co-production of scientific and social orders also dealt with evaluation procedures used by international development agencies, the interplay of internationalism and science and a brief history of Unesco. Polar research Since 1986 specialized in the history and politics of polar research in Antarctica. Also concerned with \\"climate as research and politics\\". Introduced the thesis that the International Geophysical Year (IGY 1957/58) and the political regime that followed upon it (i.e., the Antarctic Treaty System) was marked by geopolitical rivalry, no longer in the form of imperialist conflict but by translation of national political agendas into scientific competition and cooperation between participant countries, a \\"sublimation of politics in science\\". Thus one can speak of the construction of Antarctica as a continent by and for science. In connection with the Fourth International Polar Year (2007‚Äì2009) worked on the history of the four international polar years to highlight changing foci, conditions of research, logistics and epistemological characteristics over the past 125 years.

In Germany, Plockhorst is mainly known to experts today, whereas his pictures are still very popular in the United States and their reproductions can be found in many American homes and churches.  Life  The Good Shepherd The Guardian Angel Plockhorst was born in Braunschweig, Germany, where he had a 5-year education in lithography at the Collegium Carolinum, after which he trained to be a painter with Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld in Dresden in 1848, with Carl von Piloty in Leipzig and Munich, and finally with Thomas Couture in Paris in 1853. In Munich Plockhorst copied the paintings of Rubens and Tizian in the Old Pinakothek. He also took study travels to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy before settling in Berlin where he began to paint portraits, but he also proved his talent for religious themes with a large painting (‚ÄúMary and John returning from the grave of Christ‚Äù). From 1866 to 1869 he was a professor at the Grandducal Saxonian Art School (Gro√üherzoglich-S√§chsische Kunstschule) in Weimar, where painter Otto Piltz was one of his pupils. Then Plockhorst returned to Berlin where he died in 1907.  Work  Plockhorst was a member of the late Nazarene movement, a German Romantic art school (together with other German Protestant painters such as Karl Gottfried Pfannschmidt and Heinrich Ferdinand Hoffmann). Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, they had recourse to Medieval and religious art topics.  Religious topics  In 1872, Plockhorst exhibited a painting which was soon regarded as his chief work, ‚ÄúThe Battle of archangel Michael with Satan for the body of Moses‚Äù (today in the St√§dtisches Museum, Cologne). His next major work was the altar painting ‚ÄúThe Resurrection of Christ‚Äù for the cathedral of Marienburg, painted by order of the Prussian ministry of education and cultural affairs.

Plockhorst's painting The Guardian Angel (1886), showing an angel and two little children close to an abyss, was reproduced as a color lithography in thousands of copies and greatly influenced the later pictures of guardian angels. The glass windows of several U.S. American churches show motifs taken from Plockhorst, e. g. ‚ÄúThe Nativity‚Äù in the Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma; \\"The Good Shepherd\\" in First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma; ‚ÄúMoses presents the Ten Commandments to Aaron on the mount Sinai‚Äù in the First Congregational Church UCC, Owosso, Michigan; ‚ÄúThe Good Shepherd‚Äù in the Zion Lutheran Church, Baltimore, MD, and ‚ÄúThe Flight into Egypt‚Äù in the Stanford Memorial Church. Plockhorst's oil painting ‚ÄúNoli me tangere‚Äù, which is more than two square meters large, had a remarkable fate. Originally, Plockhorst painted it for the German Court. Later, it was to be exhibited in England, but on September 3, 1880 the ship Sorata, with the painting on board, was stranded on rocks between Adelaide and Melbourne, drawing water into its hold to a depth of 5.5 metres.Thomas N. Stephens, Wreck Report for 'Sorata', Board of Trade, 17 January 1881, Marine Board Offices, Port Adelaide. Accessed 18 April 2013. Much of the cargo was salvageable, but the artwork was completely encrusted by a white layer. It looked as if the sea water had decomposed the color particles. In this condition Prof. Francis Rouleaux, director of the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg (Berlin) and Commissioner General for the German Empire,\\"Professor Francis Rouleaux\\", 18 October 1879, in Australian Town and Country Journal p. 737. Accessed 18 April 2013. took it to Melbourne, Australia. When the Melbourne International Exhibition was prepared in 1880, the art dealer Alexander Fletcher (1837‚Äì1914) bought the painting for a trifling sum and took it to the restorer George Peacock. Peacock discovered that the white layer was just plaster of Paris from the frame, which had been dissolved by the sea water. He could easily remove it, and Fletcher sold the restored painting to the National Gallery of Victoria for a considerable sum. At that time, the three largest daily newspapers of Melbourne reported extensively on that clever move.Caroline Jordan, , in The La Trobe Journal, State Library of Victoria, Australia, no. 75, Autumn 2005, pp.77-93, hosted at www.archive.org. Accessed 18 April 2013.  Portraits  Plockhorst painted a portrait of the musician Franz Liszt (1857) and created portraits of other important people like the Leipzig publisher Tauchnitz, the Leipzig honorary citizen Carl Lampe, David Hansemann and the children of the family Platzmann. Besides, he portrayed members of the German nobility like Emperor Wilhelm I and his wife Augusta (1888; today in Berlin, National Gallery).  Illustrations  For the books of the Tauchnitz publishing house, Plockhorst drew different title-pages and frontispieces, e.g. for Three tales for Girls by the British author Dinah Maria Mulock Craik and for Charlotte M. Yonge's book The little Duke or Richard the Fearless. Ben Sylvester‚Äôs Word (1861). His illustrations for the following two books became very successful, * From Bethlehem to Golgotha.

This inspired Key to write the work which became the American national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. John Stuart Skinner (22 February 1788 ‚Äì 21 March 1851) was an American lawyer, publisher, and editor.Wilson, p. 545  Biography  Skinner began practicing law as an attorney at the age of twenty-one in 1809. On March 10, 1812, he married Elizabeth G. Davies, the step-daughter of Theodorick Bland. Also in 1812, President James Madison made a special commission and selected Skinner to become a government agent \\"to receive and forward the ocean mails, to furnish the vessels with necessary supplies, and to see that nothing transpired prejudicial to the interests of the republic or offensive to enemies thus admitted under the guardianship of a flag of truce.\\" Skinner soon obtained the duty of agent for prisoners-of-war and parole. In 1813, Skinner was ordered to move his offices from Annapolis to Baltimore. He then accepted a purser's commission in the navy for the duration of the war. On September 3, 1814, Skinner, as the prisoner-of-war exchange officer, was selected with Francis Scott Key, (1779‚Äì1843) by fourth President James Madison for a mission to release Dr. William Beanes, (1775‚Äì1824), who was being held prisoner by the British. Skinner and Key went on board General Ross's ship on September 7, that was anchored in the Chesapeake Bay.Sedeen, p. 20 [Robert Ross being a general in the British Army would not have \\"had\\" a ship. Tonnant was the flagship of the British Admiral in command, Alexander Cochrane and it would have been he, not Ross who would have made the determination to release Beanes.] They were carrying a flag of truce and a letter authorized by President Madison setting out the case that Dr. Beanes should not have been arrested and taken prisoner because he had been an unarmed civilian when he previously arrested some British soldiers.Molotsky, p. 88 Skinner even had letters from these British soldiers that he presented to Ross praising the American doctors on how well the British soldiers were treated. This was an argument that Ross should release Dr. Beanes because of this excellent medical care. It is not known for sure if Dr. Beanes, being a medical doctor, was among those that treated the wounded British soldiers. Skinner with Key negotiated with Ross for nearly a week on board his ship and finally Ross agreed to release Beanes.Sedeen, p. 21 Upon the release of Beanes they were not allowed to return to Baltimore because of key information they had collected by being on board Ross's ship from September 7‚Äì13. They were transferred from Tonnant to another British warship, and then to their own sloop. They were just allowed to watch the attack on Fort McHenry from their own sloop, known as a cartel or truce boat, under British guard. The sloop was tethered to a British ship about from Fort McHenry and guarded by a number of British marines to prevent any escape. The morning of September 13 at seven o'clock the British bombardment of Baltimore began. The city was defended by Fort McHenry in the harbor. Skinner, Key, and Beanes initially watched a huge American flag made by Mary Pickersgill flying above Fort McHenry as a representation of the American resolve to defend Baltimore. The bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore went into the night of September 13 with them not knowing how the battle was going. When the smoke cleared on the morning of September 14, Key along with Skinner and Beanes were able to see the American flag still waving‚ÄîFort McHenry had not been taken by the British. On their way back to Baltimore, Key was inspired to write a poem, \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", that later became the American national anthem, \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\"Wilson, p. 545 He was with Francis S. Key on the mission that suggested the latter's song, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" Francis Scott Key first showed his work to Skinner and had it published. \\"After the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore, it was Skinner whom Francis Scott Key first showed his work known today as \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" Documentation also exists that he was the one who had it published.\\"Molotsky, p. 109 \\"Others suggest that Key's companion, Skinner, was the one who got the copies printed.\\"  Publications  Skinner established in 1819 the American Farmer, the first agricultural journal in the United States to attain prominence.Kane, p. 13 The first recognized agricultural periodical, however, was the Agricultural Museum that started publication in 1810.PHASE VI - MARYLAND document of Cornell University Skinner's periodical was warmly accepted by Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Timothy Pickering. In 1829, Skinner published the first American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine. His devotion to this work enticed him to dispose of the American Farmer the same year. Skinner sold this magazine after publishing it successfully for ten years. In 1845, Skinner began a new publication, the Farmer's Library and Monthly Journal of Agriculture. This was succeeded in 1848 by the Plough, the Loom, and the Anvil, which he published until his death. The periodicals that Skinner published gave a new stimulus to agricultural pursuits and added to the general popularity of outdoor sports.  Positions  Skinner was postmaster of Baltimore from 1816 until 1849. Skinner served with Joshua Barney and became known as \\"Maryland's Paul Revere.\\" Skinner was at one time chief of the agricultural bureau of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Railway artillery gun TM-3-12. In June‚ÄìDecember 1941 it took part in the defence of the Soviet naval base on the Hanko peninsula. Soviet passenger ship Iosif Stalin, used for evacuation of troops from Hanko in November 1941, was damaged by a mine on 3 December 1941 and captured by the Germans. The Battle of Hanko (also known as the Hanko Front or the Siege of Hanko) was a lengthy series of small battles fought on Hanko Peninsula during the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union in the second half of 1941. As both sides were eager to avoid a major, costly ground battle, fighting took the form of trench warfare, with artillery exchanges, sniping, patrol clashes, and small amphibious operations performed in the surrounding archipelago. A volunteer Swedish battalion served with Finnish forces in the siege. The last Soviet troops left the peninsula in December 1941.  Background  As part of the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty which formally ended the Soviet-Finnish Winter War, Hanko was leased to the Soviet Union as a Soviet naval base. The civilian population was forced to evacuate before Soviet forces arrived. The leased area included several surrounding islands, several coastal artillery sites (among them the important fort of Russar√∂), important harbor facilities, and an area suitable for an airfield, which the Soviets quickly constructed. Troop transport rights from the Soviet Union to Hanko and back put severe strain on Finnish-Soviet relations, and played a part both in Finland's decision to allow German troops to transit Northern Finland, and later, to go to war with the Soviet Union. Though Hanko had originally been leased as a naval base, ground forces were far more numerous, with only a small naval detachment being present at the base.  Operations  At the start of the war, Finnish ground troops quickly isolated Hanko and its 25,300-man Soviet garrison. Though Mannerheim initially declared that liberating Hanko would be a primary goal of the war, Finnish troops in the area did not receive authorization to attack the base. Instead, as the Finns had built the Harparskog line on the border of the leased area during the Interim Peace, they moved to occupy these positions. The front remained mostly static, with action consisting mainly of artillery strikes and some limited probing or patrol activities on both sides. Small scale naval and amphibious actions took place in the surrounding archipelago. Finnish forces surrounding the base initially consisted of the 17th Division, the 4th Coastal Brigade, and supporting units. By the end of the summer, the 17th Division, which had made up the bulk of the besieging force, was transferred to East Karelia. Finnish efforts to blockade the base from the sea were less successful, due both to strong Soviet resistance, and to equipment failures (such as torpedoes used by Finnish submarines, which often failed to detonate on impact). Minefields laid on the sea lanes leading to Hanko and the surrounding waters were more effective, claiming several Soviet supply vessels. These problems, in addition to the rapid German advance on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, caused the base to lose its importance and made it an untenably heavy burden for the Soviet Baltic Fleet. In autumn 1941 the order was given to evacuate Hanko. Base personnel, troops and most of their light equipment and supplies had been removed by December 1941. Heavier equipment which couldn't be readily moved was sabotaged or destroyed in place. Soviet naval forces performing the evacuation suffered heavy losses from minefields. The Soviet base at Hanko, its accompanying coastal fort at Osmussaar, and the minefields laid to protect the Soviet Baltic Fleet, had hindered Finnish and German naval activities, and had made it problematic for freighters to reach the Finnish ports of Helsinki and Kotka. As Finland lacked the resources to transport enough goods over land, this caused severe logistical problems, with material stuck in seaports on the Western coast. Finnish and German minesweepers opened a sea-lane through the minefields outside of the gun range of Russar√∂ to allow freighters to reach even the Eastern ports, but it wasn't until the Soviet evacuation that they were able to clear the more secure coastal sea-lane, allowing safer passage.  Amphibious operations  Both Finnish and Soviet coastal forces conducted numerous small-scale amphibious operations in the archipelago surrounding the Hanko Peninsula. The first of these clashes took place at the beginning of July 1941; active operations ended the following October. Fighting on these small islands was often fierce, and withdrawing from them under fire was extremely hazardous. In general the operations had little effect on the overall battle, as territorial gains remained negligible.  Battle of Bengtsk√§r  After capturing the small island of Morgonlandet in July 1941, Soviet forces launched a small-scale amphibious assault against the Finnish island of Bengtsk√§r, which had a lighthouse and was thus an important observation post. The initial landing, performed in the middle of the night in foggy conditions, was successful, as Finnish sentries believed the approaching boats to be German minesweepers; however, the small garrison recovered quickly. Putting up fierce resistance, the Finns managed to retain control of the lighthouse while summoning help from nearby naval forces and coastal artillery. The fighting continued throughout the night. In the morning Finnish reinforcements were able to force the remaining Soviet raiders to surrender and drive their naval support away.  Evacuation  The evacuation of Hanko was performed in several convoys, between October 16 and December 2, 1941, which managed to transport roughly 23,000 troops to Leningrad. The fleet suffered casualties from Finnish minefields and coastal artillery, losing 3 destroyers and 2 large transports (Andrei Zhdanov and Iosif Stalin) as well as several smaller vessels. Finnish troops entering the area found it heavily mined.

The episode was written by Chris Black and directed by John Putch. Plot As the day begins, Betty tells Hilda about Amanda and is very concerned about her expenses and living arrangements, including not paying part of her rent, and when they see her arrive with shopping bags, Betty attempts to tell Amanda that she has to come up with a way to pay her part of the rent, stop eating Betty's food and wearing Betty's clothes. Amanda however ignores Betty as usual, blaming it on an imaginary person named \\"Bad Ronald.\\" As Betty tells Christina about her situation, Christina warns Betty about living in an apartment in Manhattan that is out of Betty's bracket, even with cash-strapped Amanda around, and that she can't survive on ramen alone let alone pay the rent. That same day, Daniel and Wilhelmina has announced that Mode just launched ModeNY.com and has opened it up to the staff. Betty pitches, and with Amanda's social savvy, lands a story idea: How to have fun in NY on zero dollars. So Amanda come up with the perfect title for the article, appropriately called \\"How I Blew Ten Grand Without Spending a Dime\\". And despite Betty's reluctance, even after telling her family about her first article for the website, their partnership is pretty good, to a point. Amanda seems to have all the ideas and know-how, as she shows Betty how to take advantage of makeup samples from pricey stores, tucking in the tag of a $2000 garment to return later, drinking free booze at gallery exhibits, and allowing generous men to buy them dinner. All goes well when the two guys that they met at the gallery, Claudio and Luca, ply the girls with expensive champagne during a dinner date ... until the bill comes and the men were nowhere to be found. Stunned by the high priced bill, Betty uses a ploy by telling the manager that she plan to feature the restaurant on the Modeny.com website. After seeing sweat pouring down Betty's face, the manager buys Betty's story. Unfortunately, after they leave the restaurant, Amanda discovers that her wallet is gone (it was stolen by the aforementioned guys), along with the rent money. Betty becomes furious over what Amanda did and tells her flat out that they will be evicted because of Amanda's irresponsibility (by calling her \\"Bad Amanda\\"), then walks away and heads towards her family home in Queens to have a heart to heart talk with Ignacio. The following day, Daniel tells Betty that he liked the article and thinks that she and Amanda make a great team. But as she sees Amanda running from her, Betty is stunned to see Amanda wearing a waitress' outfit, as Amanda has taken on a second job. While Betty tells her that there's now extra cash, she tells Amanda that she may want to keep that second job. Later back at the apartment, Betty surprises Amanda with a dinner for her day at work and gives her roommate a new wallet. Wilhelmina's feelings for Connor continues to consume her. It appears that she has Marc spying on Connor's every move. Even Christina (who reminds Willi she's not due for at least two months) notices and calls her on it. Christina also reveals that the unborn Meade will be a boy and also calls Willi out on whether she really wants this child, which Willi responds by finally admitting that even though her main reason was to get part of the Meade empire through the baby, she tells Christina that she wants to be a part of the child's life. Meanwhile, Daniel and Molly's friendship has become more noticeably closer than ever, a move that has observer Claire literally slapping Daniel's face, warning him that she is still engaged to Connor. Later that evening Daniel shows Molly \\"The Closet\\" where she gets to pick an outfit. After she settles on a red dress Daniel and Molly starts to share an almost-kiss until Molly runs off and leaves Daniel standing there, which is caught on surveillance that's conveniently viewed by Wilhelmina (courtesy of Marc), who just found a way to win Connor as her man, future husband and acting father to her yet unborn son. Production This episode's production number was originally listed as 311 (Season 3, episode 11), but was renumbered due to an error.From Spoiler TV (November 7, 2008) This also marks the first time in the series' run that an episode was named for one of its principal characters on the show other than Betty. And as with \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\", this episode centered around Becki Newton's Amanda persona. Also Amanda's last name was mentioned as \\"Tanen- Sommers\\" in this episode. Reception In a review from zap2it, \\"Sticking with Ugly Betty's snotty characters usually pays off because they eventually expose a bit of sympathetic humanity. Tonight was Amanda's turn. Amanda isn't the worst roommate ever (that award would go to my friends' roommate who practiced bulimia in the shared shower), but she's no prize. Besides treating Betty like a servant, wearing her clothes, and blaming the missing food on the mythical Bad Ronald, she doesn't even bother paying rent. This is New York: Rent is supreme.\\"\\"'Ugly Betty' and Bad Amanda share more than ramen\\" from zap2it.com (December 5, 2008) In Entertainment Weekly's review, Tanner Stransky was excited to see Ashley Jensen get some screen time in this outing: \\"I'm happy to report that for the first time in quite a while, Christina (played by Jensen) enjoyed a quip-filled episode on Ugly Betty.

It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski. Definition The Minkowski distance of order p (where p is an integer) between two points : X=(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\text{ and }Y=(y_1,y_2,\\\\ldots,y_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is defined as: :D\\\\left(X,Y\\\\right)=\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i- y_i^p\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p} For p\\\\geq1, the Minkowski distance is a metric as a result of the Minkowski inequality. When p<1, the distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is 2^{1/p}>2, but the point (0,1) is at a distance 1 from both of these points. Since this violates the triangle inequality, for p<1 it is not a metric. However, a metric can be obtained for these values by simply removing the exponent of 1/p. The resulting metric is also an F-norm. Minkowski distance is typically used with p being 1 or 2, which correspond to the Manhattan distance and the Euclidean distance, respectively. In the limiting case of p reaching infinity, we obtain the Chebyshev distance: :\\\\lim_{p\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i-y_i^p\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p}} = \\\\max_{i=1}^n x_i-y_i. \\\\, Similarly, for p reaching negative infinity, we have: :\\\\lim_{p\\\\to-\\\\infty}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i-y_i^p\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{p}} = \\\\min_{i=1}^n x_i-y_i. \\\\, The Minkowski distance can also be viewed as a multiple of the power mean of the component-wise differences between P and Q.

Pneumatic trail or trail of the tire is a trail-like effect generated by compliant tires rolling on a hard surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn. More technically, it is the distance that the resultant force of side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch. Causes Pneumatic trail is caused by the progressive build-up of lateral force along the length of the contact patch, such that lateral forces are greater towards the rear of the contact patch (though less so when the rear of the contact patch begins sliding) and this creates a torque on the tire called the self aligning torque. Because the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of a turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn. Variation Pneumatic trail is at its maximum when the slip angle is zero and decreases as slip angle increases. Pneumatic trail increases with vertical load.

Created by Majesco Entertainment, she is the series' titular protagonist, appearing in both games and later extended media, such as comic books and films related to the series. In English she is voiced by Laura Bailey in BloodRayne and BloodRayne 2, and Jessie Seely in BloodRayne: Betrayal; in Japanese she is voiced by Romi Park in BloodRayne. She was portrayed by Kristanna Loken in the first live action film, and by Natassia Malthe for its sequels. Appearances In BloodRayne games Rayne is a human vampire hybrid called a Dhampir, born 1915. Her human mother was raped by her vampire father, Kagan. Kagan later murdered her mother's entire family so that the only family member Rayne could turn to was him. This was a policy for all of the dhampir he sired or \\"created\\", possibly so that humans wouldn't revolt and use the vampiric weakness of the Sun, water, and holy relics against them. In the 1930s, she spent her teenage years trying to hunt down and kill her father, to avenge her family. She led a life of juvenile delinquency; using her vampiric powers and bloodlust to hunt down her father and avenge her mother. Her search led her to Europe, where she murdered several vampires before being apprehended. She claimed that her victims had been vampires, but was disbelieved by the authorities, but quickly managed to escape from them and continue her hunt. Recognizing her dhampir nature as well as her skills at hunting vampires, she was recruited into the mysterious Brimstone Society via an invitation. The Brimstone Society sent her on missions to eliminate supernatural threats to the world, including those involving vampires as well as demons and unnatural apex predators. One of these missions required her to use her vampiric powers against the Nazis during World War II, who were on the verge of using magical artifacts to bring the demon lord Beliar back to life. Rayne also learned of a plan to use demonic parasites called 'Daemites' against the enemies of the Nazis, after they had been tested on prisoners. The background to the story is influenced by the existence of various historically real Nazi occult groups such as the Thule society. In other BloodRayne media In the first BloodRayne movie that came out in 2005, she is played by actress Kristanna Loken. The movie's setting and date is different from the video games, instead of her being an American dhampir born in the 20th century, she is a Romanian dhampir born in the 18th century. The storyline is also different from the video games, as she joins the Brimstone Society in the movie while also tracking down her father Kagan (played by Sir Ben Kingsley) in the movie. She also falls in love with Sebastian (played by Matthew Davis) who is a part of the Brimstone Society too. In the sequel to the first film BloodRayne 2: Deliverance, Rayne is replaced by actress Natassia Malthe and just like her video game counterpart, she has an American accent. In the film she takes on Billy the Kid in 19th century USA and is helped by Pat Garrett in the town of Deliverance. She also meets Muller, who is one of the current members of the Brimstone Society in the 19th century. In the sequel to the second film BloodRayne: The Third Reich, Malthe reprises her role. In the film she fights against the Nazis in Europe during World War II, encountering Director Ekart Brand, a Nazi leader whose goal is to inject Adolf Hitler with Rayne's blood in an attempt to transform him into an all powerful dhampir and attain immortality. She joins the French resistance group, whose leader, Nathaniel (played by Brendan Fletcher), falls in love with her. Other appearances Rayne's promotional model for BloodRayne: Betrayal at E3 2011 In 2005, Rayne appeared in Majesco Entertainment's Infected as an unlockable character. When asked if she had a storyline of her own for the title, Majesco producer Dean Martinetti stated no, adding that the game's protagonist \\"just happens\\" to resemble the character. Rayne is the first video game character that appeared in Playboy, in the October 2004 U.S. edition as part of an article entitled \\"Gaming Grows Up\\". She has also made appearance in MTV's \\"Video Mods\\", which a music video portrayed her performing Evanescence's song \\"Everybody's Fool\\". Majesco's vice president of marketing Ken Gold said: \\"Having BloodRayne as one of the premiere 'performers' in MTV2's 'Video Mods' show is a testament to her popularity and appeal.\\" In 2009, a model dressed as Rayne was one of several characters featured as part of a \\"Video Game Girls\\" burlesque show at bar The Bordello in Los Angeles, as a tie-in to the year's Electronic Entertainment Expo event. Rayne also appear in a cameo scene in the 2018 film Ready Player One. Conception and design Rayne's early design Rayne's character was inspired by an existing Terminal Reality-created character, the dhampir Svetlana Lupescu, who appeared in their 1999 game Nocturne. Described as initially having a \\"militant, dark gothic look [...] a brunette with tight buns in her hair and a very severe body line\\", the character went through several design changes, with an active goal to make her as appealing and distinctive as possible in order to create a franchise with lasting appeal. To this end they worked to give her a unique look, relying not only on making the character sexually appealing but also make her stand out in people's eyes, which producer Raymond Holmes her arm blades achieved. Her design was additionally intended to have a presence \\"both menacing and sexy at the same time\\", which he felt made her \\"a particularly strong female lead character with lots of attitude\\". Majesco manager Liz Buckley in interviews said her designers had learned from focus groups that boys and young men not only liked female lead characters, but that they paid more attention to them. She added that \\"injecting sensuality\\" into Rayne's character design, describing her appearance as \\"lethal erotica\\" and adding that she felt no problem using the fact Rayne was \\"inherently sexy\\" to promote the character. Additional care for detail was done for her face, after noting focus groups wished to see it as compared to solely seeing the character from behind. Buckley went on to state \\"T&A; will only get you so far\\", adding that while the character was aimed at a target audience of males ages seventeen to thirty-four, she felt the character had a female fan following as well due to being \\"empowering to play\\". The character's in-game movements were animated by hand for the first title, and in the sequel were augmented by motion capture to \\"allow for more realist-looking movement\\". She added that with BloodRayne 2 the character model had also been heavily altered, adding \\"about one thousand\\" more polygons and using less on her hair in order to use more on her \\"curves and body line\\", as well as give her a more mature appearance. When questioned about the similarities between Rayne and another female vampire character Durham Red from the comic book series 2000 AD, game designer Joe Wampole stated that while similar they had not previously heard of the character, and added regarding their similar appearance \\"I think it is just natural to put a vamp chick in black leather and either color her hair black or red.\\" Laura Bailey described providing voice acting for the character as \\"a blast\\", though added she couldn't say she identified with the character. Bailey stated that during voice acting sessions, the director would occasionally approach her with changes to the game's script; if the dialogue was nasty enough to cause her to blush while saying the lines, he felt the change was good. Romi Park stated Rayne's appearance had a large impact upon her, citing Rayne's red hair and her desire to further understand the character. She went further to describe her portrayal of the character as exhibiting \\"lots of sadness\\" as well as \\"strong sense of justice\\". Promotion and reception A promotional model at IgroMir 2016 Electronic Gaming Monthly featured Rayne in their \\"Art of Gaming\\" special, noting her popularity and attractiveness; however, in a later article they decried her appearance in Playboy, stating that further similar exhibitions would damage how the public perceived the character. In G4's 2005 Video Game Vixens, Rayne was nominated for \\"Sexiest Finish\\" and awarded \\"Most Dangerous Curves\\". She was named as one of the 50 \\"greatest female characters in video game history\\" by Tom's Games in 2005, as well as the 50 \\"greatest heroines in video game history\\" by Complex in 2013. UGO.com described her as \\"epitome of a video game hottie,\\" placing her fourth on their list of the top 11 \\"video game heroine hotties\\" and praising both her appearance and abilities, later and listed as one of the top 50 \\"videogame hotties\\" at number twenty with similar sentiments. She also placed 11th in UGO's list of the \\"Top 50 Sexiest Vampires\\", which noted that while she represented a negative aspect of video games in 2002, a \\"scantily-clad heroine in a graphically violent third-person adventure\\", her feature in Playboy despite not being real meant \\"they did something right\\", and ranked eighth in their list of \\"the most badass vampire slayers\\". GameDaily ranked her 12th on their list of the top 50 \\"hottest game babes\\", stating \\"[T]he only thing sexier than a female vampire is [one] that kills Nazis,\\" also listing her as one of their favorite red- haired females related to video games. Complex listed her as the 17th hottest video game character in 2012, and Thanh Ni√™n ranked her as the eighth most sexy female character in 2015. Several other lists have featured her in a similar context, such as those by Team Xbox and Spike TV in 2008.

The initial 1920 copyright and first publishing attributes the lyrics to Malvin Schonberger and the music to John Schonberger.  Initial and enduring popularity  \\"Whispering\\" was most famously recorded by Paul Whiteman and his Ambassador Orchestra on August 23, 1920, for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Whiteman ‚Äî Denver-born, ex-navy, and self-acclaimed \\"King of Jazz\\" ‚Äî flourished in popularity from a series of hits beginning in 1920 with his release of \\"Whispering\\", an eleven-week U.S. No. 1 hit, which stayed 20 weeks in the charts and sold in excess of two million copies.Whiteman never referred to himself as \\"King of Jazz\\" but was billed as such by managers and record producers much as Benny Goodman later would be called the \\"King of Swing\\". Both Whiteman and Goodman openly acknowledged their debt to the earlier African-American musicians and each employed Black Americans as composers, arrangers and in Goodman's case being one of the first to have a mixed stage band. In 2020, Whiteman's rendition was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The song charted twice in the nineteen-sixties. In 1963, Irish singers the Bachelors had a hit with their version which went to the Top 20 in the UK. In 1964, after recording their hit \\"Deep Purple\\", American brother and sister singers Nino Tempo and April Stevens had a new hit with \\"Whispering\\". This version went to number eleven on the Hot 100 and number four on the Easy Listening chart. According to Allmusic, there have been over 700 versions of the song. As of 2010, on the online music site , there were 161 listed albums or singles containing the song \\"Whispering\\". As of 2014, TJD Online, the online version of The Jazz Discography, listed 225 recording sessions, beginning with Ray Miller and his Black and White Melody Boys, who recorded it on about July 16, 1920, Okeh 4167-A. Also, as of 2014, TJD Online listed 281 recording sessions of Dizzy Gillespie's composition, \\"Groovin' High\\", a contrafact variation of \\"Whispering\\".  Compositional structure  \\"Whispering\\", originally scored in E major, is in time. It has a 12-bar intro, the last 4 of which is an optional vamp ‚Äî then a 16-bar A-theme is followed by a 32-bar repeated chorus. The 32 bars is essentially a 16-bar B-theme played twice ‚Äî or 4 times with the repeat. Dizzy's 1945 composition, \\"Groovin' High\\", is a contrafact of \\"Whispering\\". Following a standard practice in jazz, Diz front-ran the static V7 chords with ii7 chords (a \\"static chord\\" is a chord that doesn't change), setting up a series of ii7‚ÄìV7 progressions, which creates more structure for improvising. The ii7 chord has similar properties to a iv chord (as in the iv‚ÄìV progression of church harmony). Because \\"Groovin' High\\" was a contrafact, performers, publishers, and record companies did not have to pay royalties to the original composers. Moreover, the contrafacted rendition followed a unified bebop convention ‚Äî a series of ii7‚ÄìV7 chord changes with a ii7‚ÄìV7‚ÄìI7 turnaround ‚Äî for jazz artists.

Club career Early career Born in Gennevilliers, Demb√©l√© began his career in INF Clairefontaine, before being transferred to Auxerre. On 1 June 2006, he was released from the club for disciplinary reasons. In January 2007, he joined Istres. After six months there, Demb√©l√© moved to AGF √Örhus. In July 2008, he signed with Pierikos in Greece. Lokomotiv Plovdiv After a year and a half, in which he played 32 games and scored six goals, Demb√©l√© left Pierikos to sign with Bulgarian club Lokomotiv Plovdiv in January 2010. He appeared in 14 games for the Smurfs and scored five goals. Levski Sofia On 5 June 2010, it was announced that Demb√©l√© had signed for Levski Sofia. On 9 June 2010, Demb√©l√© was officially presented as a Levski Sofia player. The transfer fee was around ‚Ç¨200,000 on a three-year contract. He made his unofficial debut against Metalist Kharkiv on 1 July 2010 and scored in a 3‚Äì2 win. His official debut for Levski was in a match against Dundalk, in the second qualifying round for Europa League. Levski had won the first match 6‚Äì0, with Demb√©l√© scoring once. In the return match Levski won 0‚Äì2, with Dembele scoring both goals. In the first round of the A PFG Demb√©l√© scored the winning goal for Levski in the Eternal Derby against CSKA Sofia. He scored a further two goals in the next Europa League qualification round against Swedish Kalmar FF. The play-off against AIK Fotboll saw Demb√©l√© scoring another decisive goal for his new club, ensuring Levski's qualification to the Group stages of the Europa League. They were drawn in Group C alongside Gent, Lille and Sporting CP. With his six goals in six games Demb√©l√© was the leading goalscorer in the Europa League qualification matches. On 9 August 2010, Demb√©l√© scored his first hat- trick for Levski against Lokomotiv Sofia. The result of the match was 3‚Äì1 with a home win for Levski Sofia. He further added to his tally in the competition by scoring in the 3‚Äì2 home win against Gent in UEFA Europa League, scoring his seventh goal in the competition. With this win Levski recorded an eight-match unbeaten run in European competitions, a run which was ended after Levski suffered a heavy 5‚Äì0 defeat against Sporting CP, followed by another loss against Lille. In Sofia, Levski played very well against Lille, with Demb√©l√© scoring the opening goal in the match. The Blues were leading 2‚Äì1 until Ivo Ivanov scored an own goal to make it 2‚Äì2. In the last match of Group C, already eliminated Levski won against Sporting CP 1‚Äì0 - the winning goal was scored by Daniel Mladenov, who was assisted by Demb√©l√©. However, Demb√©l√© continued his goal-scoring spree in the Bulgarian A Professional Football Group. By 17 September 2010 he had already scored two hat-tricks in the competition against Lokomotiv Sofia and Minyor Pernik respectively. He also scored the winning penalties in the victories against Vidima-Rakovski and Cherno More. He continued his good games after scoring the first goal against Beroe in a 2‚Äì1 win for Levski. He scored his third hat-trick in the A PFG against Pirin Blagoevgrad in Levski's 4‚Äì1 win at Georgi Asparuhov, helping his team come back from being 1‚Äì0 down. After this, he scored a goal against Litex Lovech, but Levski lost the game by a score of 1‚Äì2 and suffered a run of three straight defeats. In February 2011, during the preparation for the second part of the season, it was announced that Demb√©l√© would wear the number nine jersey, following his decision to stay during the 2010‚Äì11 winter transfer window. He was rated among the most efficient attacking players of the 2010‚Äì11 season in Europe, with a goal at every 76.89 minutes. Demb√©l√© has expressed his satisfaction with the way he was received by Levski supporters, but has been less magnanimous in his assessments regarding the quality of the training sessions during his time in Bulgaria. SC Freiburg On 3 June 2011, it was officially announced that Demb√©l√© had been bought by SC Freiburg for 2.5 million euros. It was the first time in the club's history that it paid over two million euros for a transfer, making it the largest transfer fee Freiburg has ever paid. On 28 June 2011, Demb√©l√© made his unofficial debut for the team and netted a goal in the 4‚Äì1 win over TSG Balingen in a friendly match. On 6 August 2011, he made his first official appearance, coming on as a late substitute in the 2‚Äì2 away draw with FC Augsburg in a Bundesliga match. Demb√©l√©'s first Bundesliga start came on 28 October 2011, in the 0‚Äì1 home loss against Bayer Leverkusen. After making nine appearances for the club without a goal, Demb√©l√© netted for the first time in the Bundesliga on 26 November 2011, scoring a last-minute goal to secure a 1‚Äì1 away draw with TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. Wuhan Zall (loan) In February 2013, after finding it difficult to secure a starting spot with the German side, Demb√©l√© was loaned out to Chinese Super League club Wuhan Zall until the end of the year.

Taxonomy The holotype of \\"Haptodus\\" garnettensis is RM 14156, a partially articulated skeleton (cranial and postcranial) of immature individual. More than 16 well-preserved specimen of various ontological states were referred to this species. All specimens came from the Garnett Quarry, located in the Anderson County of Kansas. They were collected from the Rock Lake Member of the Stanton Formation (Lansing Group), dating to the late Kasimovian stage of the late Pennsylvanian series, about 304 million years old. Laurin (1993, 1994) suggested that Haptodus garnettensis would have to be renamed because he saw Haptodus baylei as a possible nomen dubium. In his dissertation revising taxa assigned to Haptodus, Spindler (2015) proposed that \\"Haptodus\\" garnettensis is not congeneric with the Haptodus type species, giving it the nomen ex dissertationae Eohaptodus. He also concluded that two specimens referred to garnettensis, ROM 43608 and ROM 43601, represent new genera and species, the former specimen being named Kenomagnathus by Spindler (2020) and latter specimen being given the nomen ex dissertationae Tenuacaptor reiszi.Spindler, F. 2015.

Ti√£o Carreiro (real name: Jos√© Dias Nunes), born in a farm in the outskirts of Ara√ßatuba city, in the Brazilian state of S√£o Paulo, started to learn how to play the acoustic guitar at a very young age. Later, only 13, he went to work in the Giglio Circus, where he made a music pair with his cousin Waldomiro. The circus owner encouraged Ti√£o to learn the viola caipira (a kind of steel ten-string acoustic guitar). Ti√£o Carreiro played along with various other violeiros (viola caipira players that create m√∫sica caipira or Brazilian country music). He reached fame with Pardinho (real name: Ant√¥nio Henrique de Lima), consolidating the music double as Ti√£o Carreiro e Pardinho. Alongside Pardinho, Ti√£o Carreiro is credited as the inventor of the Pagode (not to be confused with the Pagode style of Samba), the rural Pagode (Pagode Caipira).  Influenced  Among the violeiros such as C√©sar Menotti & Fabiano, Chit√£ozinho & Xoror√≥, Milion√°rio e Jos√© Rico among others, Ti√£o Carreiro e Pardinho are viewed as one of the most influential songwriters/singers of the M√∫sica Sertaneja style of Brazilian popular music.  Major Hits  Between their major hits we have: Pagode em Bras√≠lia (en.: \\"Pagode in Bras√≠lia\\"), their first success (recorded in 1959), Boi Soberano (en.: \\"Sovereign Ox\\"), Filhinho de Papai (en.: \\"Daddy's Little Son\\") and Cochilou o Cacimbo Cai (en.: \\"If You Sleep You Lose the Pipe\\").

Prior to being called \\"Wabash Blues\\", the first name of this significant early jazz standard was called \\"The Trombone Jazz\\" and was orchestrated by Joseph E. Maddy in the summer of 1918 at Kansas City's Electric Park - a then summer proving ground for vaudeville artists. At the beginning of Jones' career in Chicago he played in the Edgewater Beach hotel dance band with Maddy and the early jazz sax team of Jones on alto and Maddy on tenor were in great demand -- it is through this partnership that Jones came in contact with \\"Wabash Blues\\".

Early life Alan Lucas was one of three sons of Alys Hubbard Lucas and Keith Lucas, inventor of the first aeronautical compass. His brothers were the aeronautical engineer David Keith-Lucas and the political scientist Bryan Keith-Lucas. After the death of Keith Lucas in 1916, his wife Alys changed the family name, and, as Alys Keith-Lucas, edited a short book giving his background together with reminiscences of him and a list of his publications. He was educated at Gresham's School and then at the University of Cambridge, graduating Bachelor of Arts, a first degree which as usual later gave him the title of Master of Arts. Interested in the emerging profession of social work, not then studied at post-graduate level in Britain, Keith-Lucas moved to the United States. At Case Western Reserve University he earned a master's degree in social administration, and he went on to take a Doctorate in Philosophy from Duke University.Powell, John Y., Alan Keith-Lucas, PhD, 1910‚Äì1995: teacher extraordinaire, p. 85 Career In 1950, Keith-Lucas joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He also founded the Group Child Care Consultants Services, a vehicle to help private and public group homes better serve their juvenile population. He was later named Alumni Distinguished Professor Social Work. As a consultant, Keith Lucas was well regarded.Powell, John Y. Alan Keith-Lucas, PhD, 1910‚Äì1995: Teacher Extraordinaire. p. 86 He often held controversial and challenging views in regards to childhood development and the structure of group homes. He believed in the primacy of getting the larger family unit involved, using state welfare agencies as a temporary reprieve for children while an intervention was made to get the family back on track.Powell, John Y. Alan Keith-Lucas, PhD, 1910‚Äì1995: Teacher Extraordinaire. p. 87 Beliefs Keith-Lucas' ideas about how to intervene with problematic family situations were sometimes controversial. Unlike many others in his field, he readily endorsed the use of group homes as the first, not the last, intervention.Powell, John Y. Alan Keith-Lucas, PhD, 1910‚Äì1995: Teacher Extraordinaire. p. 87-89 His positions were sometimes unpopular with administrators, and especially policymakers. Retirement Though he retired from active teaching in 1975, Keith-Lucas was still heavily involved in social work. He served on the board of the North American Association of Christian Social Workers, lectured, and consulted with residential child care agencies.In memory: Alan-Keith Lucas Social Work and Christianity 1995, 22, 2 p. 158-159 He continued to write and publish journal articles and books until his death in 1995.

The Eotitanosuchidae were large predatory therapsids of the Wordian epoch. It was once considered to belong to a separate infraorder of therapsids called Eotitanosuchia. Characteristics The Eotitanosuchians seem to be more advanced than the Biarmosuchia in that the temporal opening behind the eye socket‚Äîalthough small‚Äîis still somewhat larger than the biarmosuchians; it is expanded in the upper rear (posterodorsal) margin, allowing the area of attachment of the adductor (jaw closing) muscles to be visible from the dorsal (top) view looking down. The eotitanosuchian bite was stronger and more efficient than the biarmosuchian bite. For this reason, some paleontologists see the eotitanosuchids as transitional between the biarmosuchians and higher therapsids. It is at least as likely that features of a larger temporal opening‚Äîand hence increased muscle mass and biting power‚Äîevolved simultaneously among a number of early therapsid groups, due to the obvious advantages this adaptation conferred. One must be wary in applying cladistic methodology to characteristics that are likely to evolve simultaneously among many competing lineages. In other respects the eotitanosuchians are quite primitive; they were the least modified in their jaw apparatus from their sphenacodont ancestry.

He also played minor counties cricket for Devon between 1938 and 1955. Humphries made his debut near the end of June 1946, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, and scored 21 in his only innings. After making 3 in the first innings of his next game, against Glamorgan, he showed quite some consistency, his next five innings being 22, 16, 17, 22 and 16. However, he was unable to break through and produce a significant score, and after this one season he was never again to appear at first-class level. For Devon, however, it could be a different story, and in June 1949 Humphries produced his finest form. First he hit 199 against Kent II, and immediately thereafter he struck 216 not out, carrying his bat against Surrey II. By coincidence, in this game Alan Brazier made 216 not out in Surrey II's own first innings! Two brothers, Cedric and Gerald, also played for Worcestershire.

Robledo published the music as a piano solo in 1919, and two years later Dorothy Terriss wrote the lyrics. Paul Whiteman‚Äôs instrumental recording in 1922 became one of the first 20 recordings in history to sell over 1 million copies.  History  Juli√°n Robledo, an Argentine composer born in Spain, published the music for ‚ÄúThree O‚ÄôClock in the Morning‚Äù in New Orleans in 1919. In 1920 the song was also published in England and Germany, and lyrics were added in 1921 by Dorothy Terriss (the pen name of Theodora Morse). The song opens with chimes playing Westminster Quarters followed by three strikes of the chimes to indicate three o'clock. The lyrics then begin: It's three o'clock in the morning, we've danced the whole night through. This ‚ÄúWaltz Song with Chimes‚Äù created a sensation when it was performed in the final scene of the Greenwich Village Follies of 1921. In this performance Richard Bold and Rosalind Fuller sang the song while ballet dancers Margaret Petit and Valodia Vestoff rang the chimes. Frank Crumit recorded the song for Columbia Records in 1921, but its biggest success came in 1922 when Paul Whiteman released a recording on the Victor label, selling over 3.5 million copies of the record, and fueling the sale of over 1 million copies of the sheet music. The song has been recorded by some of the most renowned orchestras of the 20th century, including Frank De Vol and his Orchestra (1950), Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians (1960), Mitch Miller and the Gang (1960), Bert Kaempfert and his Orchestra (1964), and Living Strings (1971). The song also has become a jazz standard with notable recordings by Dizzy Gillespie (1953), Oscar Peterson (1956), Dexter Gordon (1962), Harry James (1965), and Thelonious Monk (1969). The song was also repatriated to the home country of the composer, Argentina, where it was published as ‚ÄúLas Tres de la Ma√±ana‚Äù by G. Ricordi & C. and interpreted as a tango vals by the orchestra of Enrique Rodriguez in 1946. In popular culture F. Scott Fitzgerald references \\"Three O‚ÄôClock in the Morning\\" in chapter 6 of his book The Great Gatsby. The song is played at a party, and Fitzgerald uses it to reflect the thoughts of a character (Daisy) in the novel. ‚ÄúThree O‚ÄôClock in the Morning\\" has also appeared in many movies. Judy Garland sang the song in Presenting Lily Mars (1943). The song has also appeared in Margie (1946), That Midnight Kiss (1949), Belles on Their Toes (1952), The Eddy Duchin Story (1956), The Great Gatsby (1974), When Brendan Met Trudy (2000), and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). The song is also referred to in John Cheever's short story \\"Goodbye, My Brother,\\" first published in August 25, 1951 edition of The New Yorker. The song is playing when the unnamed narrator, a member of the Pommeroy family, arrives at the annual costume dance held at the club house on the island of Laud's Head, a fictional island off the coast of Massachusetts. The narrator explains that the theme of the party was to \\"come as you wish you were.\\" The story's thematic structure relies heavily on ideas about nostalgia and a longing for a long-gone era.

Kellogg and his Arabian horse Antez The W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center is a research facility on the campus of the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) which specializes on equine studies, breeding and research. History The horse center dates back to 1925. W.K. Kellogg had a longtime interest in Arabian horses, and purchased for $250,000 in Pomona, California, to establish a ranch. After erecting the first buildings, Kellogg funded the development of an Arabian horse breeding program, which (as of 2008) remains the oldest in the United States and the fifth largest in the country. Starting with breeding stock descended from the imports of Homer Davenport and W.R. Brown, Kellogg then looked to England, where he purchased a significant number of horses from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, making multiple importations during the 1920s. The Kellogg ranch became well known in southern California not only for its horse breeding program but also for its entertaining, weekly horse exhibitions, open to the public and frequently visited by assorted Hollywood celebrities. Among many other connections to Hollywood, the actor Rudolph Valentino borrowed the Kellogg stallion, \\"Jadaan,\\" for use in his 1926 movie, Son of the Sheik, along with a Kellogg employee, Carl Raswan, who rode in certain scenes as Valentino's stunt double.Dudley, Aaron. \\"Jadaan: The Horse That Valentino Rode\\", The Western Horseman, Mar 1952 reprinted at Windt im Walt Farm, web site accessed April 5, 2010 In 1932, Kellogg donated the ranch, which had grown to to the California State University system. During World War II, on the ranch was taken over by the U.S. War Department and was known as the Pomona Quartermaster Depot (Remount). In 1948, the ranch was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and in 1949, the land was deeded to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Later in 1949, Kellogg donated the ranch to the state of California, requiring that the property would be used for educational purposes, the herd of Arabian horses must be maintained, and the horse shows would continue. Title to the then ranch and horses was passed to the State of California. Stables of the Kellogg ranch The ranch became part of the Voorhis unit of what was then known as the California Polytechnic State College in San Luis Obispo. This became known as the Kellogg Campus, and in 1966, it was separated to form California State Polytechnic College Pomona (now California State Polytechnic University, Pomona). The Center occupied the original Kellogg stables prior to the dedication of the existing facility on April 6, 1974. This was also the location of the W.K. Kellogg Airport (not to be confused with the W. K. Kellogg Airport in Battle Creek, Michigan). It operated from 1928 to 1932, and was then the largest privately owned airport in the country. Today Today the facility is home to approximately 85 purebred Arabian horses used in Equine Sciences‚Äô teachings, outreach, research and internationally recognized breeding and training programs. Facilities at the center include of pasture, three barns, foaling stalls, a breeding area, a veterinary clinic, a farrier shop, four arenas and a grandstand. The University operates the W.K.

In mid-August there were over 113 recorded earthquakes in the region between Kefalonia and Zakynthos, and the most destructive was the August 12 earthquake. The event measured 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale, raised the whole island of Kefalonia by , and caused widespread damage throughout the islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos. The maximum felt intensity of shaking was X (extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Between 445 and 800 people were killed.  Earthquake  The earthquake struck at 09:23:55 (UTC) or 11:23:55 (local time); the Royal Navy vessels HMS Gambia and HMS Bermuda were among the first on the scene. In addition, four Israeli warships received calls for help coming from the island of Kefalonia and the ships headed to the island. The sailors provided emergency medical aid, food, and water. This was the first time Israel provided aid to a disaster-stricken area. Although known as the \\"Great Kefalonia earthquake\\", damage was very heavy in Zakynthos' eponymous capital city. Only two buildings survived there; the rest of the island's capital had to be rebuilt. Argostoli, the capital of Kefalonia, suffered substantial damage and all of Kefalonia's buildings were flattened except for those in Fiskardo in the far north.  Damage  Damage still present in 2011 As well as causing major destruction on the two islands, the economic impact was far greater, and damage was estimated to have totaled billions of drachmas. Many people fled the island: some people temporarily moved to the capital, however the majority emigrated out of Greece entirely to countries such as Canada, USA, Australia or the UK, leaving both the islands and their economy in ruins. On November 15, 1953 The Greek state issued a special set of 2 stamps dedicated to the earthquake. One stamp was of 300 drachmas value (equivalent to $10 in those days) depicting the collapsing bell tower of the Faneromeni Church at Zakynthos. The other stamp, denominated at 500 drachmas ($16,67), showed the damage to the famous De Bosset stone bridge at the Argostoli bay. The stamp set was issued in order to support financially the earthquake fund for the relief of those who had suffered. An Italian mission of the National Fire and rescue Services (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco) was sent to help people and save heritage artifacts. An Officer of the Italian National Fire and rescue Services (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco) and an icon of St. Mary and Child recovered from a collapsed church in Zante after the 1953 earthquake. Credits: CNVVF - Centro Documentazione  Aftermath  Earthquakes still regularly affect the islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia, including several 2006 earthquakes in Zakynthos and others in 2003 and 2005. There were also several large earthquakes on January 26 and February 3, 2014, measuring 6.1 and 6.0 on the Richter scale. The epicenters of both were in Kefalonia at very shallow depths and caused damage in the island. On October 25, 2018 there was a 6.8 magnitude earthquake off the coast that damaged parts of the Zante port docks. Following that quake, there were more than 50 additional quakes over 4 magnitude in the Ionian Sea between the 25th and the end of October.

The charity provides information and education on HIV and AIDS. It partners with organizations in countries most affected by HIV. Avert.org The award winning Avert.org website offers HIV and AIDS information for a digital generation. The site had 12 million visitors in 2015, with nearly 200,000 returning visitors each month.Impact of our work Users of the site are from over 180 different countries, with the top ten countries spread across five continents; USA, India, UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, the Netherlands, Indonesia, the Philippines and Kenya.AVERT's global website The website is divided into two main areas ‚Äì public and professional. The public section of the site provides information for individual on sexual health, HIV and STIs, and relationships ‚Äì including personal stories from the site's users. It offers reassurance to people newly diagnosed with HIV and dispels dangerous myths about HIV and AIDS. The professional section of the site provides a thoroughly-researched and referenced resource on the global epidemic, alongside an up-to-date news service to inform people working in HIV programming, policy or research, health workers, teachers and students. In 2012, Avert won the Nominet Internet Award under the ‚ÄòOnline Training and Education‚Äô category, in association with the British Library. International projects Avert funds a range of projects in developing countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is most severe. Avert has worked with a variety of organisations, including Sangram in southwest India, and Tholulwazi Uzivikele in KwaZulu Natal. Currently the charity is working in partnership with four organisations. The Umunthu Foundation in Malawi has been working with Avert since 2010 to provide HIV counselling and testing, awareness-raising, prevention and support to people living with HIV. Since 2005, Sisonke in South Africa has been working with Avert to build a network across 20 rural communities of elderly women caring for their grandchildren who have been orphaned by AIDS. Avert has been working with Phelisanang Bophelong in Lesotho since 2015 to improve awareness of HIV among young people locally. The project also plans to support key affected groups in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and in prisons. In Zambia, since 2015 Avert has been working with Bwafwano Integrated Services Organisation (BISO) on tackling the HIV and TB co-epidemic. BISO provides education, treatment and support for those affected by HIV, TB or both, and campaigns for people's rights and needs. History and early work Avert was founded in 1986, by Peter Kanabus and his wife Annabel, daughter of former Sainsbury's chairman Robert Sainsbury. In its first fifteen years the charity focused on producing educational publications and funding HIV-related educational, social and medical research. A number of Avert's publications, such as the AIDS: Working With Young People (1993) teaching pack were based on substantial educational research. In addition many thousands of AVERT's booklets were distributed in the UK each year, covering such topics as sex education, sexuality and HIV. Medical research funded by Avert included the first ever study of the effect of pregnancy on the progression of HIV disease, and social research included studies of HIV and drug use in UK prisons.Drug use in prison, BMJ 1994;308:1716 (25 June) The Avert.org website was launched in 1995 in order to provide education about prevention of HIV and support for individuals living with HIV and AIDS. In 2001 the charity decided to concentrate on two key areas of work: its information and education website Avert.org website, and its programme work outside of the UK in countries with a particularly high or rapidly increasing rate of HIV infection. The charity's work made headlines in 2008 when South African doctor Colin Pfaff was suspended from his post for supplying HIV positive, pregnant women with the antiretroviral drug AZT,Clinicians Support South African Doctor in Dispute Over Providing AIDS Therapy for Pregnant Women, Fox News Channel, 18 February 2008 which had been paid for by Avert. At the time the South African government had not approved the use of AZT to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, even though it was recommended by the World Health Organization and was widely used in other developing countries. Rural doctors, scientists, AIDS activists and organisations rallied in support of Pfaff, and the charges were subsequently dropped.KZN doctor cleared on treatment charge, Mail & Guardian, 21 February 2008 In 2015 the Avert.org website had a major redesign, with a focus on mobile users. Accreditations and awards In January 2015, Avert became a certified member of the Information Standard, a UK National Health Service (NHS) accreditation that recognises trustworthy health information.Information Standard In 2014, outputs of research funded by Avert (the Care in the Home Study) exploring challenges facing caregivers in rural South Africa was published in the PLOS ONE journal.Community Care Workers, Poor Referral Networks and Consumption of Personal Resources in Rural South Africa, PLOS ONE journal In 2012, Avert won the Nominet Internet Award under the ‚ÄòOnline Training and Education‚Äô category, in association with the British Library.

It is accessible by pump boat from Talibon on the mainland of Bohol. Physiography Bansaan, a boomerang-shaped island, is composed of raised coral reefs and part of the bigger Calituban reefs, a group of scattered and low-lying reefal islands located off the northwestern coast of Bohol Island. The highest elevation is 1.5 m above sea level. Rainfall distribution The island falls under Coronas climate IV, where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. The highest observed average rainfall based from July 1975 to September 1984 records was observed in the month of June [] and the lowest was in April []. The annual average rainfall was . Biodiversity Fauna A total of 24 species of birds including 14 species of waders and 10 species of terrestrial birds were identified in Bansaan. The counts made during the visits in February and September 1991 confirm the importance of the island as a wintering area and stop over site for the waders during their northward and southward migration. Grey-tailed tattlers (Heteroscelus brevipes), grey plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus), and common redshanks (Tringa totanus) constitute the largest numbers recorded. A total of 35 species of marine mollusks were reported including 28 species of gastropods and 7 species of bivalves. Apparently all those species are edible, and are also used as raw materials in the shellcraft industry. The preliminary entomological survey of Bansaan Island revealed a total of 16 species representing 6 orders and 16 families of insects. Of the 16 species, Order Diptera comprises the largest number of families. Orders Lepidoptera and Orthoptera ranked second with 3 families each, followed by Order Coleoptera having 2 families and the last were Orders Hemiptera and Hymenoptera with only one family each. Leafminers, leaf beetles, loopers and leaftiers are pests on mangrove trees: Pongamia pinnata, Osbornia octodonta, Terminalia catappa, Excoecaria agallocha, Sonneratia caseolaris, and Lumnitzera littorea. Meadow grasshoppers, mole crickets, ants, and long-horned grasshoppers were found attacking some terrestrial plants and grasses. Some insects were found to be pests to human. These include mosquitoes, houseflies, and small dungflies. Soil composition Beach sand and hydrosol are the dominant soil types of the island. Both soil types are characterized by high pH values with high amounts of soluble salts and exchangeable sodium which resulted to high salinity and electrical conductivity as well as base saturation of nearly 100%. Moreover, it was noted that most of the soils are coarse textured. Geology The whole island is composed of white coralline sands derived from the weathering of coral reefs. Based on the paleontological analyses of three selected samples, it showed a list of known microfossils identified as common in nearshore or shallow environment, typical in coral reef areas. Geological assessment of the island showed no mineral deposits worthy of exploitation.

It was originally developed as a planned community in the 1910s, but had effectively disappeared by the end of the 1920s. The name is a portmanteau of Lake Okeechobee and Atlantic Ocean. History House of Thomas E. Will, founder of Okeelanta, Florida, on North New River Canal, Okeelanta, Sept. 1916 In early 1913, Thomas E. Will, a former college professor, college president, and secretary of the American Forestry Association, purchased almost 900 acres of land south of South Bay and adjacent to 120 acres of land he had previously purchased. Later that year, Will launched the planned community of Okeelanta on what is now where the Bolles Canal meets the North New River Canal, laying out small plots to sell to settlers. His son Lawrence was one of the first five settlers. Although the settlers had difficulty farming the soil muck, they eventually managed by varying their crops of beans, potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce. Will himself joined the group of settlers in late 1914. Supplies were shipped to the community by boat up the New River from Fort Lauderdale, almost sixty miles away. In early 1915, a store was built after Will offered the store owner a lot free of charge. New settlers arrived during 1915. In 1916, the Palm Beach County School Board built a one-room schoolhouse on a lot donated by Will. By 1917, there were 110 families in the town, plus a hotel, town hall, lumberyard, blacksmith, and barber. Will and other residents organized for the construction of a road from West Palm Beach to Fort Myers through Okeelanta. Although the road was built, it bypassed Okeelanta and ran along the south shore of Lake Okeechobee four miles north. Nevertheless, a dirt road was constructed along the spoil bank of the Bolles Canal connecting Okeelanta with the cross-state highway at Six Mile Bridge, just southeast of Belle Glade. By 1920, the town population had grown to 200 residents, despite problems with the soil, floods, freezes, and mosquitoes. However, that year saw a particularly devastating flood, which caused a suspension of agricultural operations. Will left Okeelanta for Fort Lauderdale on what he believed would be a temporary basis. The early 1920s saw the water table alternately sink to levels ideal for farming, but too low for shipping, or to levels too high for farming yet ideal for shipping. By 1925, a visitor reported Okeelanta to be almost deserted, with the north side of the Bolles Canal reverting to sawgrass and boggy ground in front of the old hotel. The disastrous 1928 Okeechobee hurricane put a final end to Okeelanta. After the east-west road from West Palm Beach bypassed Okeelanta, Will began a campaign to have the state build a \\"Lauderdale to Lake\\" road alongside the North New River Canal. After the development of sugar interests in the area, Will expanded his efforts to have the state build a road from Miami to South Bay. In 1935, the Florida State Road Department allotted $450,000 ($8.4 million in 2019 dollars) for the construction of the road. In 1937, the Florida Legislature adopted a resolution naming the road the Thomas E. Will Memorial Highway, which was opened to traffic in 1941. Now U.S. 27, the road passes through Okeelanta, of which nothing remains save for the now-paved Bolles Canal Road, signed as County Road 827.

Reference beam (5-4-6) and object beam (5-7-6) have identical optical path length and can thus cause white light interference. Parts of the Mirau interferometer: 1. Lens of the microscope, 2. Semitransparent mirror, 3. Object surface, 4. Reference mirror with reference beam, 5. First reflection of reference beam, 6. Third reflection of reference beam, 7. Reflection of object beam A Mirau interferometer works on the same basic principle as a Michelson interferometer. The difference between the two is in the physical location of the reference arm. The reference arm of a Mirau interferometer is located within a microscope objective assembly. It is named after Andr√© Henri Mirau, who filed a patent on the concept in 1949.[Patent US2612074 https://patents.google.com/patent/US2612074] A schematic of a Mirau interferometer is shown on the right. At the beam splitter the source light is split into a reference path (reflected) and a sampling path (transmitted onto the sample). On the comparison face there is a mirrored circle in the middle. The two paths recombine to form an interference image. By changing the z position of the sample, interference images are acquired at a sequence of path (phase) differences: 0, Œª/4, Œª/2, and 3Œª/4. These interference maps are functions of background intensity, fringe modulation, and phase. Three such images provide enough information to solve for the topographic image of a sample. This orientation is often used in optical profilometers due to the increase in stability between the sample and reference path lengths. Immersion Mirau Interferometer An immersion Mirau interferometer is a modification of a Mirau interferometer, in which the light path is immersed in a liquid medium. One application of an immersion Mirau interferometer is to image cells with medium. Since the index of refraction of the medium is substantially different from that of the neighboring air, each millimeter of medium would introduce a path length difference from the reference wave, and ideal interference conditions are lost. Filling the microscope optics with medium restores the ideal interference conditions. Simultaneous Immersion Mirau Interferometer In immersion Mirau interferometry, the interference patterns needed to reproduce the image are acquired at different times and vibrations, if they exist, prevent maintaining the desirable phase shifts between consecutive frames. Thus immersion Mirau interferometry is very sensitive to vibrations. One solution is to acquire all interference images at the same time. This is known as a simultaneous immersion Mirau interferometer.

He is the father of two youthful sons (Malcolm and Donalbain), and the victim of a well- plotted regicide in a power grab by his trusted captain Macbeth. The origin of the character lies in a narrative of the historical Donnchad mac Crinain, King of Scots, in Raphael Holinshed's 1587 The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Unlike Holinshed's incompetent King Duncan (who is credited in the narrative with a \\"feeble and slothful administration\\"), Shakespeare's King Duncan is crafted as a sensitive, insightful, and generous father-figure whose murder grieves Scotland and is accounted the cause of turmoil in the natural world. Analysis King Duncan is a father-figure who is generous and kind. Duncan is also firm (\\"No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive / Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death / And with his former title greet Macbeth.\\"Macbeth, Act 1, Scene 2, lines 63‚Äì65.), insightful (\\"There's no art / To find the mind's construction in the face.\\"Macbeth, Act 1, Scene 4, lines 11‚Äì12.), and sensitive (\\"This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air / Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself / Unto our gentle senses.\\"Macbeth, Act 1, Scene 6, lines 1‚Äì3.). However, the role is full of irony; he is completely deceived in the intents of Macbeth and therefore may come across as naive. Although a modern reader may view Duncan as an incompetent monarch in this respect, Duncan represents moral order within the play and his murder signals the onset of chaos. King Duncan of Scotland (c. 1001‚Äì1040) is the ruler of Scotland whom Macbeth murders for his throne. Shakespeare's Duncan is an elderly man, a respected and noble figure; as Macbeth reflects, he 'Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been / So clear in his great office, that his virtues / Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu'd' (1.7.17‚Äì19). Duncan's generous and trusting nature contrasts strikingly with the evil which surrounds Macbeth. Though he appears only in Act 1, he is an important symbol of the values that are to be defeated and restored in the course of the play. His generosity and fatherly affection for Macbeth make his murder even more appalling. The unconscious irony is sharp when he greets Macbeth, who is already plotting against him, with a declaration of his own ingratitude, in 1.4.14‚Äì16. Duncan's faith, misplaced first in the rebellious Cawdor and then in Macbeth, provides the audience with an introduction to the atmosphere of betrayal that exists throughout the world of the play. The historical Duncan was a much younger man than Shakespeare's character, only a few years older than Macbeth. The playwright altered Duncan's age to stress the evil of Macbeth's crime, but in fact Macbeth did not murder Duncan; he usurped the crown through a civil war, and Duncan died in battle. The two were first cousins, both grandsons of Duncan's predecessor on the throne of Scotland, King Malcolm II (ruled 1005‚Äì1034). Duncan's claim to the throne was somewhat stronger than Macbeth's as it appears that Malcolm II had named Duncan as his heir, although the facts are obscure. However, Macbeth's action was an ordinary political manoeuvre in 11th century Scotland; King Malcolm II took the throne previously by murdering his cousin, Kenneth III (997‚Äì1005). Shakespeare devised his version of Duncan's death from an account of an earlier royal assassination, that of Malcolm II's uncle, King Duff (d. 967), in his source, Raphael Holinshed's history.http://hudsonshakespeare.org/Shakespeare%20Library/Character%20Directory/CD_macbeth.htm Film and television performances Film Duncan has been played in film adaptations of the play by Anthony Head in 2008, Gary Sweet in 2006, and Tom Reid in 2003. Javier Ronceros performed the role in Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth (2005) and John Little in Macbeth: The Comedy (2001). Christopher McCann played Duncan in Macbeth in Manhattan (1999). Greg Korin, John Corvin, and Antti Litja played the role in 1998, 1997, and 1987 respectively. Erskine Sanford played King Duncan in Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth, Louis Northop in a 1946 film adaptation, and by Nicholas Selby in 1971 Macbeth Spottiswoode Aitken and Charles Kent both played Duncan in silent versions of Macbeth in 1916 and 1908 (the first screen version of the play). David Thewlis portrayed the part in Justin Kurzel's 2015 adaptation. In Orson Welles' 1948 film adaptation of Macbeth, the role of King Duncan is reduced. 1.2 is cut entirely as well as generous portions of 1.4. King Duncan is seen briefly in 1.6 as he enters Macbeth's castle amid considerable pomp. The top of 1.4 with its description of Cawdor's execution has been transplanted to this scene. Banquo's \\"temple-haunting martlet\\" speech is given to Duncan. Duncan is later seen asleep in bed for a fleeting moment as Lady Macbeth slinks about in the chamber's shadows. Donalbain has been cut from the film, leaving Duncan with just one son, Malcolm. Television Vincent Regan played King Duncan in \\"ShakespeaRe-Told\\" Macbeth (2005), Ray Winstone in Macbeth on the Estate (1997), Laurence Payne in \\"Shakespeare: The Animated Tales\\" Macbeth (1992), Griffith Jones in A Performance of Macbeth (1979), and Jacques Mauclair in Macbett (1974), Kevin Coughlin on the \\"Goodyear Television Playhouse\\" (1955), and Lee Patterson on the \\"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents\\" Dream Stuff (1954). Other television performers of the role include Philip Madoc (1998), Mark Dignam (1983), Powys Thomas (1961), Malcolm Keen (1960), Leo G. Carroll (1949), Arthur Wontner (1949).

Through a series of small interdisciplinary seminars students are connected with faculty, school culture, and the institutions of University Circle. The goal of the SAGES program is to help students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to solve real world problems and to allow students to communicate their ideas effectively through writing and speech. All of Case Western Reserve University's colleges that grant undergraduate degrees participate in the SAGES program, which extends through the student's academic career. Traditionally, a student will spend the first two years of their college experience participating in a series of 3 interdisciplinary seminars. These interdisciplinary seminars are followed in the third year by a departmental seminar usually in the student's field of study. Finally, in the fourth year a student participates in a Capstone project which is designed to demonstrate the intellectually agility and collaborative spirit SAGES aims to foster in its students.http://www.case.edu/sages/index.html Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Encyclopedia of Cleveland History was printed in 1987 and 1996.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Sieciech√≥w. It lies in historic Lesser Poland, near a rail line from Radom to Dƒôblin, on the National Road 48, approximately south-east of Kozienice and south-east of Warsaw. Sieciech√≥w used to be a town from 1232 to 1869. Sieciech√≥w has a long and rich history. Until the 14th century, it was one of major political, economical and administrative centers of Lesser Poland‚Äôs Duchy of Sandomierz, which later was renamed into Sandomierz Voivodeship. It was the seat of a castellan and a county, but in the late 14th century, Sieciech√≥w's importance diminished, and it was replaced as administrative center of this part of Lesser Poland by quickly-developing Radom. Sieciech√≥w takes its name from Sieciech - a palatine at the court of duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman. In the times of the Piast dynasty, Sieciech√≥w was the seat of local dukes, and first mention of the village dates back to the 10th century. In 1132 the Sieciech√≥w Castle became the property of High Prince Boles≈Çaw Krzywousty and became the seat of castellans. As Gall Anonim wrote, it was the biggest castle along the Vistula between Sandomierz and P≈Çock. In 1232 Sieciech√≥w received a town charter (Magdeburg rights). In the late Middle Ages, Sieciech√≥w was located on a merchant trail from Sandomierz through Zawichost, to Lithuanian lands. It had a parish church of St. Lawrence, which controlled parishes of large parts of northern Lesser Poland, at such towns, as Kozienice, Stƒô≈ºyca, Dƒôblin, Zwole≈Ñ and Kazimierz Dolny. Sieciech√≥w probably had a defensive wall, and a Vistula river port. Its first known castellan was named Florian, his name was mentioned in 1239. In 1432 King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço gave permission for fairs, but period of prosperity ended after the change of the course of the Vistula. As a result, the town no longer controlled the strategic river, and the castle, which was located on a hill right above river bank, no longer fulfilled its role. Furthermore, after the Union of Krewo, Poland was no longer threatened by Lithuanian raids. Sieciech√≥w remained a town until 1869, when the government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland reduced it to the status of a village. Among points of interest there are: * Baroque abbey church (1739-1767), * complex of a Benedictine Abbey. The abbey itself was founded by either Sieciech or Boleslaw Krzywousty. Its original location is not known, the abbey was moved to its present location some time in the mid-14th century. Current complex was built in the 18th century. The abbey had a renowned school, which existed until 1575, and a large library, * St. Lawrence parish church (1710-1769), with a bell from 1459, * Sieciech√≥w Castle. It is not known when original, wooden castle was built, but it has been established that the stone complex was built by King Kazimierz Wielki. The castle was already in ruins by 1575, after it had long lost its strategic importance.

This is a list of notable bow tie wearers, real and fictional; notable people for whom the wearing of a bow tie (when not in formal dress) is also a notable characteristic. Bow tie wearing can be a notable characteristic for an individual. Men's clothier Jack Freedman told The New York Times that wearing a bow tie \\"is a statement maker\\" that identifies a person as an individual because \\"it's not generally in fashion\\". Numerous writers and bow tie sellers have observed that the popularity of this type of neckwear can rise and fall with the fortunes of the well-known people who wear them. Until the 20th century, the bow tie was the general rule for neckties. Starting in early 20th century, the bow tie started to become more rare. In 1996, The Wall Street Journal quoted statistics from the Neckwear Association of America showing that bow ties represent 3 percent of the 100 million ties sold each year in the United States, most of them part of formal wear, such as for white tie and black tie. Attention to famous bow tie wearers in commerce and fashion commentary Those who write about bow ties often mention famous people who wear or have worn them. These writers often make the point that the image conveyed to others by a bow tie can be affected by associations with celebrities and famous people in the past. A common fashion accessory in the nineteenth century, the bow tie had positive associations by mid-twentieth century, bolstered by real-world personalities like President Franklin Roosevelt and the \\"political genius\\" Right Honourable Sir Winston Churchill as well as \\"devil-may-care\\" characters portrayed in movies by actors like Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra. By the 1970s, however, the bow tie became associated with nerds and geeks, such as the slapstick characters played by Jerry Lewis, and Mayberry's fictional deputy sheriff, Barney Fife. This perception was reinforced by the bow tie's association with Pee-wee Herman and U.S. Senator Paul Simon. The perceptions associated with bow ties started to take another turn in the 1980s, when Success Magazine founder, W. Clement Stone, spoke out in support of the neck wear after the publication by fashion author John Molloy which observed, \\"Wear a bow tie and nobody will take you seriously.\\"Quoted in Stone associated bow-tie wearing with virility, aggressiveness, and salesmanship. In further defense of the bow tie, its use by figures such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Saul Bellow has been cited. Celebrities' effect on bow-tie wearing Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wore a bow tie in the early 1960s, when he worked for U.S. President John F. Kennedy. When a celebrity is noticed wearing a bow tie, it can affect bow tie sales; sales see an improvement when the accessory is associated with younger celebrities such as Tucker Carlson. When Raj Bhakta wore one during his stint on The Apprentice, haberdashers reported customers asking for a bow tie which looked like his. Similarly, after Matt Smith made his debut as the bow tie- wearing Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who, Topman reported a significant increase in demand for bow ties (from 3% of all tie sales to 14%). Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote about his decision as a college student to start wearing bow ties in his memoir A Life in the Twentieth Century: Innocent Beginnings, 1917‚Äì1950. Schlesinger remarked that he made his decision in part because a number of famous men he admired had a penchant for the neck wear. In addition, he noted that they prevent dinner mishaps, saying, \\"It is impossible, or at least it requires extreme agility, to spill anything on a bow tie.\\" Commercial interests using famous wearers to encourage sales Bow tie sellers often cite famous people who have worn the neckwear as a way of encouraging more customers. Jack Cutone, co-founder of Boston Bow Tie, noted that there is ample evidence to support the uniqueness and stature of those who wear bow ties, including Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud.\\"Boston Bow Tie Launches Web Site to Market Distinctive and Stylish Bow Ties With a Traditional Flair\\" news release posted on Business Wire, December 30, 1999, according to the LookSmart FindArticles Web site, accessed January 17, 2007 Beau Ties Ltd., an online bow tie seller, has featured a \\"C.

Bow ties were conventional attire in the nineteenth century. Portraits of U.S. presidents from Van Buren through McKinley commonly show them in bow ties. Wearing of a bow tie was seldom commented upon and did not form part of the public perception of figures such as American inventor Thomas Edison or Communist theorist Karl Marx.

Diving Bill Nagle was one of the earliest divers to dive regularly beyond diver training agency specified depth limits for safe deep diving (normally 130 feet in sea water). Nagle regularly dived to greater depths, and engaged in hazardous shipwreck penetration, often on previously unexplored shipwrecks. Whilst Nagle was by no means the first diver to start diving at great depths (Sheck Exley was generating considerable fame even before Nagle engaging in extremely deep cave diving), it was his pioneering approach to wrecks that set him apart from other divers of his era. In 1985 Bill Nagle led the team of divers, including Gary Gentile, Art Kirchner, Tom Packer, Mike Boring, John Moyer and Kenny Gascon, who recovered the bell of the Andrea Doria, which had previously been thought lost and unrecoverable. In the book, Shadow Divers, Robert Kurson indicates that the team had a \\"last man standing\\" arrangement, whereby the last one of them left alive would keep the bell. The bow bell has still not been recovered to date. The story of the recovery expedition is recounted in Gary Gentile's book, Andrea Doria: Dive to an Era. Bill Nagle was also one of the first people in the Northeastern United States to commence dive chartering as a full-time business with the custom dive vessel, the Seeker. The Seeker specialised in taking experienced wreck divers to the more remote and dangerous wrecks in the North East. It became an extremely competitive business as diving deep wrecks became more popular, and Nagle's bitter feud with rival captain, Steve Bielenda, after the latter was designated \\"King of the Deep\\" in a feature in Time magazine is carefully chronicled in the book Shadow Divers. In subsequent years, diving beyond recreational diving limits would become refined as a sport in itself, known as \\"technical diving\\", with its own dedicated training and procedures. During Bill Nagle's prime, divers who exceeded agency specified safety limits were simply referred to as \\"gorilla divers\\".Gary Gentile, Advanced Wreck Diving Handbook, page 8. Bill Nagle died shortly before the advent of trimix became popular amongst non-professional divers, dramatically reducing the risks associated with diving deep wrecks. Today many of the wrecks that Bill Nagle first explored diving on air with outdated US Navy Decompression tables are routinely dived by divers who have received technical training and who are breathing trimix and using modern dive computers. Alcoholism and death The later years of Bill Nagle's life were dominated by a descent into alcoholism and drug abuse. It was this disease that ultimately took his life at the age of 41. His last great expedition was the exploration of German submarine U-869, although he was never physically able to dive on it. Nagle died before the wreck was positively identified. His close friend, John Chatterton refused to attend his funeral, insisting that the man inside the coffin was not his friend and associate - it was the monster who had killed Bill Nagle.Shadow Divers, , at page 231 Richie Kohler, another diver closely connected with the U-869 expedition, was one of the pallbearers.

It was a part of the World War II campaign in Narva. The Soviet 8th Army started attacking the Auvere Station on July 20 with artillery fire. The defenders had some losses. The Estonians and Germans (of the 11th (East Prussian) Infantry DivisionAlthough the name \\"East Prussian\\" is often associated with this division (two regiments were formed in East Prussian regions), the division also had personnel from other areas of Germany, particularly the Rhineland.) had built trenches and dug themselves into foxholes. In the morning of July 24, the Soviet assault commenced with 30‚Äì50 batteries firing 17,000 shells and grenades (2,000 tons), inflicting significant casualties to the Estonian 45th Regiment in Auvere and the 44th Infantry Regiment in the borough of Sirgala. After two hours of preparatory artillery fire, the two regiments were attacked from the air. Three German and eight Soviet bombers were shot down in air combat. Under artillery cover, the Soviet 122nd Rifle Corps and a tank brigade pierced to the German positions, while the 117th Rifle Corps encircled the Estonian regiment, which reformed themselves in circular defence. Relieved by Paul Albert Kausch's Kampfgruppe (the \\"Nordland\\" Tank Battalion with additional units) and three rocket artillery launchers, the Estonians went on for a counterattack. The 44th Regiment was saved by the swift movement of artillery behind them clearing their previous positions of Soviet troops. The 117th Rifle Corps reached the headquarters of the Estonian I Battalion, who resisted by heavy machine-gun fire in circular defence. The support by the anti-tank weapons of the 14th Company and Kausch's Kampfgruppe helped to seize the main frontline back to the control of the \\"Narwa\\". The attempts by the 117th and the 122nd Rifle Corps to break through were repelled in a similar way, causing them to lose 3,000 men, 17 planes and 29 tanks, compared to the loss of 800 troops of army detachment \\"Narwa\\". On the next day, the Soviet 8th Army tried to capture the German positions again, but they were repelled by machine guns.

The Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, sometimes called \\"The Move\\" by fans, was the decision by then-Browns owner Art Modell to move the National Football League (NFL)'s Cleveland Browns from its long-time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season. Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns franchise, history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to establish a new franchise, the Baltimore Ravens and was allowed to transfer the football organization under his control to the new franchise. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . As nobody was prepared to purchase and operate a franchise for the 1996 season in Cleveland Stadium, the NFL deactivated the Browns franchise and the city of Cleveland agreed to demolish the stadium and rebuild it on the same site. In exchange the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season by adding a team or moving one from another city. In 1998, the NFL decided to establish its 31st football organization in Cleveland and sold the Browns franchise to a new owner for $530 million. The \\"new\\" Browns recruited players through an expansion draft and resumed play in 1999. This compromise, which was unprecedented in North American professional sports, has since been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues, including ones in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium Art Modell. In 1975, knowing that Municipal Stadium was costing the city over $300,000 annually to operate, then-Browns owner Art Modell signed a 25-year lease in which he agreed to incur these expenses in exchange for: quasi-ownership of the stadium, a portion of his annual profits, and capital improvements to the stadium at his expense. Modell's new company, Stadium Corporation, paid the city annual rents of $150,000 for the first five years and $200,000 afterwards. Modell had originally promised never to move the Browns. He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts' move to Indianapolis, and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles. However, Modell refused to share the suite revenue with the Cleveland Indians, who also played at Cleveland Stadium, even though much of the revenues were generated during baseball games. In 1990, the Indians convinced local governments and voters to build a new ballpark and give the suite revenue to the baseball corporation. Modell, mistakenly believing that his revenues were not endangered, decided not to participate in the Gateway Project that built Jacobs Field for the Indians and Gund Arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Modell's assumptions proved incorrect, and Stadium Corporation's suite revenues declined sharply when the Indians moved to Jacobs Field in 1994. Soaring player salaries and deficits put additional financial pressure on the Browns' owner. Modell claimed to have lost $21 million between 1993 and 1994. Announcing the move After Modell realized how much revenue he lost from the Indians moving out of Cleveland Stadium, he requested an issue be placed on the ballot to provide $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Stadium. Entering the 1995 season, the Browns, coached by Bill Belichick, were coming off a playoff season in which the team finished 11‚Äì5 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs. Sports Illustrated predicted that the Browns would represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXX at the end of the season, and the team started 3-1, but they then lost their next three games. On November 6, 1995, with the team at 4‚Äì5, Modell announced in a press conference at Camden Yards that he had signed a deal to move the Browns to Baltimore in 1996 ‚Äì a move which would return the NFL to that city since the Colts moved to Indianapolis after the 1983 season. Modell said he felt the city of Cleveland did not have the funding nor political will to build a first-class stadium. The very next day, on November 7, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the aforementioned tax issue to remodel Cleveland Stadium. Despite this, Modell ruled out a reversal of his decision, saying his relationship with Cleveland had been irrevocably severed. \\"The bridge is down, burned, disappeared\\", he said. \\"There's not even a canoe there for me.\\" Initial reaction The City of Cleveland sued Modell, the Browns, Stadium Corp, the Maryland Stadium Authority, and the authority's director, John A. Moag Jr., in City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Browns, et al., Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas Case No. CV-95-297833, for breaching the Browns' lease, which required the team to play its home games at Cleveland Stadium for several years beyond 1995, filing an injunction to keep the Browns in the city until at least 1998. Several other lawsuits were filed by fans and ticket holders. The United States Congress even held hearings on the matter. Actor/comedian Drew Carey returned to his hometown of Cleveland on November 26, 1995, to host \\"Fan Jam\\" in protest of the proposed move. A protest was held in Pittsburgh during the Browns' game there against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but ABC, the network broadcasting the game (and also the home of Carey's new sitcom that had just premiered), declined to cover or mention the protest. That game was one of the few instances that Steelers fans and Browns fans were supportive of each other, as fans in Pittsburgh felt that Modell was robbing their team of their long-standing rivalry with the Browns. Browns fans reacted with anger to the news, wearing hats and T-shirts that read \\"Muck Fodell\\". On the field, the Browns stumbled to finish 5‚Äì11 after the announcement, ahead of only the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars, to whom they lost twice, in the AFC Central, becoming the first team in the NFL's modern era to lose twice to a first-year expansion team. Virtually all of the team's sponsors pulled their support, leaving Cleveland Stadium devoid of advertising during the team's final weeks. After the announcement, the team lost all their home games except the final, in which they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 26-10. The game itself was blacked out on television locally on WKYC, but NBC did broadcast extensive pregame coverage from Cleveland. Settlement After extensive talks between the NFL, the Browns, and officials of the two cities, Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns legacy in Cleveland. On February 9, 1996, the NFL announced that the Browns franchise would be 'deactivated' for three years, and that a new stadium would be built for a new Browns team, as either an expansion team or a team moved from another city, that would begin play in 1999. Modell would in turn then be granted a new franchise (the 31st NFL franchise), for Baltimore. Because he was permitted to retain the current contracts of players and other football personnel, and changed the name of his corporate entity from Cleveland Browns, Inc. to Baltimore Ravens, Inc.,https://caselaw.findlaw.com/oh-supreme- court/1184303.html Modell is typically reckoned to have moved the football organization, but not the franchise itself. The settlement stipulated that the reactivated team for Cleveland would retain the Browns' name, colors, history, records, awards, and archives. The move was approved by league owners after a 25‚Äì2 vote with three abstentions. An additional stipulation was that in any future realignment plan, the Browns would be placed in a division with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals, because of long-standing rivalries with those two teams. Upon their reactivation in 1999, the Browns were placed back in the AFC Central with the Steelers and Bengals, as well as the Ravens, Titans, and Jaguars. This arrangement put teams from Baltimore, Cleveland and Pittsburgh in the same division for the first time in NFL history. When the NFL realigned into divisions of four teams for the 2002 season, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Baltimore remained together in the new AFC North. Tennessee, Jacksonville, Indianapolis (from the AFC East), and the new Houston Texans were placed in the new AFC South. The only other active NFL team to temporarily suspend operations without merging with another was Cleveland's previous NFL team, the Cleveland Rams, during the 1943 season at the height of World War II. Aftermath and legacy The return of the NFL to Baltimore compelled the departure of the professional football team already in Baltimore at the time, the Grey Cup champion Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Although they had drawn respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore, Stallions owner Jim Speros knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in Montreal. They subsequently adopted the name and assumed the history of the team that previously played in the city, the Alouettes, who had ceased operations in 1987. Like the Browns, the Alouettes (who incidentally were originally founded in 1946, the same year as the Browns) were formally recognized as having resumed operations after a hiatus although unlike the Browns, the decision to reactivate the Montreal franchise in such a manner that it was considered a continuation of the previous franchise had not been previously planned and was made retroactively at the time of their revival. Much of the Stallions' roster and most of the Stallions' other football personnel made the move to Montreal, although unlike Modell, Speros was not formally given the sort of successor rights to existing contracts that would have allowed him to transplant his football organization to Montreal in the same manner was done from Cleveland to Baltimore - this would have been problematic due to the CFL's requirement that the re-activated Alouettes adhere to roster limits on American players (then called \\"imports\\") that the defunct U.S. CFL teams had not been bound to. The ability of Speros to retain the core of his championship roster to the point that the transaction superficially appeared to be a \\"move\\" was the result of a gentlemen's agreement between Speros and the other CFL teams. CFL commissioner Larry Smith, an Alouettes alumnus who was keen to ensure the revived Montreal franchise was an immediate contender, had pressured the other CFL teams to agree not to aggressively pursue what were technically free agents. Focus groups, a telephone survey, and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell's team. Starting with a list of over 100 possible names, the team's management reduced it to 17. From there, focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six, and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three, Marauders, Americans, and Ravens. Finally, a fan contest drawing 33,288 voters picked \\"Ravens\\", a name that alludes to the famous poem, \\"The Raven\\", by Edgar Allan Poe, who spent the latter part of his life in Baltimore, and is also buried there. The team also adopted purple and black as their team colors, a stark contrast to the brown and orange colors of the Browns. The former Colts Marching Band, which remained in Baltimore after the Colts moved to Indianapolis, was subsequently renamed the Baltimore's Marching Ravens. Along with the San Francisco 49ers, Buffalo Bills, and the Washington Football Team, the Ravens are one of only four NFL teams with an official marching band. Modell's move to Baltimore came amid an unprecedented flurry of similar threats ‚Äî and actual moves ‚Äî that fueled 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL. The Seahawks, Buccaneers, Bengals, Lions, Cardinals, and Bears used the threat of moving to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds. Modell's team was one of four that actually moved between 1995 and 1997: Los Angeles lost both of its teams for the 1995 season, as the Raiders moved back to Oakland and the Rams moved east to St. Louis (the Rams would later move back to Los Angeles in 2016); and the Houston Oilers moved to Tennessee in 1997, where they become the Tennessee Titans two years later. After several NFL teams threatened to move to Cleveland to become the reactivated Browns (most notably the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), the NFL decided in 1998 to make the reactivated Browns an expansion team, which while it temporarily gave the league an odd number of teams (causing at least one team to be off in each of the 17 weeks of the NFL season from 1999‚Äì2001), it also eliminated any possibility of an existing franchise giving up its own identity for the Browns and thus prevented more lawsuits. In an ironic twist, Al Lerner‚Äîwho helped Modell move to Baltimore‚Äîwas granted ownership of the reactivated Browns; his son Randy took over ownership after Al's death in 2002 before selling the team to Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam in 2012. From its beginning, the odd number of teams and the ensuing awkward scheduling was considered a temporary arrangement pending the addition of a 32nd NFL franchise ‚Äì although Los Angeles was heavily favored, it was ultimately the Houston Texans who were created as the 32nd team to replace the Oilers in Houston, Texas for the 2002 NFL season to give the league once again an even number of teams. Following this decision, Los Angeles became the favored destination for owners threatening to move their teams until the St. Louis Rams finally returned to Los Angeles for the 2016 season, followed by the San Diego Chargers (who had previously called L.A. home in the early days of the American Football League) one year later. The reactivated Browns have had only two winning seasons since returning to the NFL in 1999: a 9‚Äì7 finish in 2002 which also saw the team clinch a wild card spot in the playoffs, and a 10‚Äì6 finish in 2007 while barely missing the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Ravens have been more successful, reaching the playoffs eight times since 2000 and winning Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII, often to the dismay of Browns fans. Longtime placekicker Matt Stover was the last remaining Ravens player that played for the Modell- owned Browns ‚Äì he departed the Ravens following the 2008 season when the team chose not to re-sign him, finishing his career with the Indianapolis Colts. General manager and former Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome (who was in a front- office role under Modell in Cleveland) remained with the Ravens until his retirement in 2018. The move would also have an effect in Pittsburgh. Steelers owner Dan Rooney was one of two owners to oppose Modell's move to Baltimore because of a mutual respect for the team and the fans. Because of the move, the Browns‚ÄìSteelers rivalry, arguably one of the most heated rivalries in the NFL, has somewhat cooled in Pittsburgh due to the new Browns' lack of success. The Steelers‚ÄìRavens rivalry is considered the spiritual successor by fans in Pittsburgh and is one of the most heated current rivalries in the NFL. Since returning to the NFL, the Browns and Steelers rivalry has been largely one- sided in favor of Pittsburgh; although the rivalry is not as intense in Pittsburgh, Browns fans still consider it their top rivalry despite the Browns' recent struggles against the Steelers. Because of continual financial hardships, the NFL directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49 percent of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51 percent for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 8, 2004, the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club. Although Modell later retired and had relinquished control of the Ravens, he is still despised in Cleveland, not only for moving the Browns, but also for his firing of legendary head coach Paul Brown in 1963. Some considered the Browns' move and subsequent lawsuits costing Modell a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is in Canton, Ohio, 60 miles south of Cleveland and is both part of the Cleveland television market and part of the Browns' territorial rights. Modell died in 2012, having never returned to Cleveland. The Browns were the only home team that did not acknowledge, much less commemorate, Modell's death the following Sunday. The team opted not to do so at the request of David Modell, who feared that the announcement would be met with anger by Browns fans still upset about the move.https://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2012/09/cleveland_browns_cancel_their.html Effect on teams in other sports leagues Major League Baseball *The Minnesota Twins, when they signed their deal with Hennepin County, Minnesota for Target Field in 2006, agreed to a provision that was signed into law that allows the state of Minnesota the right of first refusal to buy the team if it is ever sold. Also, it requires that the name, colors, World Series trophies, and history of the team remain in Minnesota if the Twins are ever moved out of state. The deal is similar to what Modell agreed to with the city of Cleveland during the move. Major League Soccer *In December 2005, the San Jose Earthquakes moved to Houston to become the Houston Dynamo. At the time, it was announced by the league that while players and staff would move with the team, the team name, colors, logo, and records (including two championship trophies) would stay in San Jose for when a new expansion team arrives. In 2008, the Earthquakes returned under the ownership of Lew Wolff. *The Browns move in 1996 had a direct effect on a proposed move of Columbus Crew SC to Austin, Texas; the Modell Law, which was implemented in 1996, prohibits sports teams that benefited from public facilities or financial assistance from moving to another city without a six-month notice and an attempt to sell the team to a local ownership group. A lawsuit was filed by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine (who would be elected governor in November 2018) and the city of Columbus. Rather ironically, Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy and Dee Haslam, along with other investors, offered to buy the Columbus Crew in order to keep them in Columbus. The proposed sale would sell the operational rights of the Crew to the new buyers, while previous Crew owner Anthony Precourt would keep his equity stake in MLS, and would have ownership of a new franchise in Austin. The sale of the Crew to Haslam's ownership group was announced as agreed to on December 28, 2018, and was completed in January 2019. As part of the deal, the lawsuit was dismissed that day; the Modell Law remains untested as a result. National Hockey League *After the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995 to become the Colorado Avalanche, the franchise's retired numbers, name, logos, and historical stats remained in Quebec City and are expected to be used by any future Quebec City NHL franchise that may be established or move there. Upon arrival at Denver, the Nordiques' retired numbers were placed back into circulation. *In 2011, a team took the name of a city's previous team (as the Baltimore Stallions did when the Ravens forced their move to Montreal). That saga began in 1996, when the Winnipeg Jets left Manitoba for Phoenix, Arizona, and become the Phoenix Coyotes. Thirteen years later, the Coyotes went bankrupt and were taken over by the league. Winnipeg- based True North Sports & Entertainment offered to buy the team and return it to Winnipeg, where it presumably would have re-assumed the Jets' name and history. The NHL turned down that proposal ‚Äî they were still looking for an owner to operate the franchise in Phoenix, whose municipal government had agreed to subsidize the team's financial losses ‚Äî but said that moving the team back to Winnipeg was their preferred backup option. But when the Atlanta Thrashers came up for sale a year later, the league decided that there was no chance of finding an owner to operate a franchise in Georgia, so they arranged for True North to purchase the Atlanta franchise and move it to Winnipeg for the NHL season. The league decided to let True North and the new Jets use the identity of the old Winnipeg team, but not its history, which remained in Arizona with the Coyotes. The new Jets organization highlighted this change by quickly re-issuing the team's #9 jersey ‚Äî retired by the old Jets in honor of superstar Bobby Hull ‚Äî to forward Evander Kane, who had worn the number in Atlanta. National Basketball Association *The Seattle SuperSonics' move to Oklahoma City in 2008 included an agreement that the SuperSonics' name, logo, colors, and history would all be left in Seattle. This also includes banners and trophies, which would be displayed in a museum until a new franchise is brought to Seattle to be hung from the rafters of its arena. The original franchise, now the Oklahoma City Thunder, continue to keep the SuperSonics tie-ins, including records, championships, and retired numbers, until a new SuperSonics franchise is brought to Seattle. Both the Thunder and a potential new SuperSonics franchise would \\"share\\" the original SuperSonics history. *Similar to the Winnipeg Jets scenario in the NHL, the NBA first entered Charlotte in in the form of the Charlotte Hornets. That team remained in Charlotte until moving to New Orleans after the , retaining the Hornets name. The league returned to Charlotte for the with a new team, the Charlotte Bobcats. After the New Orleans franchise changed its name to the Pelicans after the , the Bobcats announced that they would reclaim the \\"Hornets\\" name effective with the . When the name change from Bobcats to Hornets became official in May 2014, it was also announced that the Hornets, Pelicans, and the NBA had reached an agreement that all history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets would be transferred to the revived Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now considered to have been established in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 (as the Bobcats, then again changing their name back to the Hornets in 2014), while the Pelicans are now considered a 2002 expansion team.

It consists of Nasser Bouzida a.k.a. \\"The Bongolian\\" on organs, percussion and vocals, Badger Burgess on bass guitar, Trevor Harding on electric guitar and Desmond Rogers on drums.  Formation and early years  Nasser Bouzida, was brought up in Harlow, England, but his formative years were spent in Newbury, Berkshire. He always had a strong love for Latin music. When he was a teenager, Nasser liked composing mini rock-operas in the style of Showaddywaddy. When he was in his early twenties he appeared on the low- budget cable TV show Jenny Powell's Hot, due to him becoming a pioneer of the sports-casual movement. On the set of this show he first met the band Bloodvessel, one of whom was Trevor Harding. A quote from their website describes the pair: > Bouzida and Harding soon formed an unbreakable bond through their love of > the Portsmouth Sea life centre and Roxy Music. After witnessing a life- > changing gig by world music surrealists Bandanna at the now infamous Bedford > Arms, the two formed Espadrille. > Their first big break came when Sea Link offered them a glamorous five show > per day three-month contract. (Including two free hot meals per day and > unlimited access to the mini-bar) On one particularly choppy entertainment > voyage the duo bumped into Coffin Nails' tattooed psycho dog-man \\"Mad-Man\\" > Scott Milsom and indie sex-fiend / owner of Europe's thinnest ears; Nick > Nichols. In the first half of 1999, the band played a gig at the Blow Up when it was situated at the Wag club in Soho, London. According to the band's website they were loved by the crowd, which had filled the club to capacity as was normal: > as usual the club was packed and the crowd absolutely loved the Big Boss > Sound. They were then immediately signed up to the club's very own Blow Up > record label. Afterwards, the band made their first release, as part of the V2 Blow Up compilation Blow Up A Go-Go with the demo version of the track \\"Humanize,\\" recorded in the band's very own Ramshackle studios. This track was then re- recorded and released as the title track on the band's own debut album. In 2000, the band appeared in and wrote the soundtrack for the short comedy film Sweet. This film starred the UK comedy duo The Mighty Boosh (Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding), who were awarded the Perrier Best Newcomers award of Edinburgh Festival. As well as providing the soundtrack, the band are in the film in the club scenes and as extras in the bar scenes. November 2000 also saw the inclusion of \\"Xmas BOOGALOO\\" on the compilation album It's A Cool, Cool Christmas. \\"Sea Groove\\" In September 2000, Big Boss Man released their first single, \\"Sea Groove\\" (named possibly due to the chance encounter between the four members on a ferry). This was part of Blow Up's new series of 7\\" records called Blow Up 45's. SELECT magazine gave the single a good review, alongside such artists as Eminem, Coldplay and Fat Boy Slim. It is said to be an \\"essential\\" 45 for the likes of DJs Snowboy, Bob Jones, Gary Crowley, Ross Alan and of course the Blow Up DJ crew. The release was marked by a show at a Blow Up club event celebrating the opening of the \\"My Generation\\" Fashion and Photography Exhibition in Stockholm. Humanize Big Boss Man's debut album, Humanize, featuring the singles \\"Sea Groove,\\" \\"Big Boss Man\\" and \\"Sell Your Soul\\" was released in April 2001. The sound has been described on their website as > a hip heavy Hammond hybrid of pop, 6T's R'n'B / Latin soul and funk. It is a very upbeat album and has the distinction of being a mostly instrumental, the only vocals being on the songs \\"Humanize,\\" \\"Big Boss Man,\\" \\"Money\\" and \\"Sell Your Soul.\\" The lyrics that are on the album are short; \\"Big Boss Man\\" and \\"Sell Your Soul\\" are the only two songs which follow a standard structure of verse/chorus etc., whereas the other two merely have a phrase repeated throughout the song. In May 2001, Later magazine gave away 100,000 copies of a compilation CD called The Later Lounge which featured kitsch classics from the 1960s and '70s. Big Boss Man had the honour of being the only contemporary act featured on the CD with their track \\"Party 7.\\" They were alongside such acts as James Clarke, Grant Green, Herbie Hancock, Paul Nero, and Hugo Montenegro. In December 2001, the Later released a compilation CD entitled The Later Lounge 2, featuring the band's debut single \\"Sea Groove.\\" In 2006 \\"Party 7\\" was featured in one of a number of advertisements for Nike's FIFA 2006 World Cup advertisement campaign. The advertisement was entitled \\"Henry\\" and featured Thierry Henry and Eric Cantona. Coincidentally, the UK BBC coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final featured \\"Party 7.\\" Blow Up records reissued the Humanize album in 2006, with stickers on the sleeve with reference to the ad. In 2002, after the release of Humanize, the band decided to tour Europe to promote it. The dates included three weeks in Spain, two weeks in Germany, then travelling to Moscow and Venice and finishing up with two weeks in France including the Le Rock Dans Tousses Etats festival in Evreux where they played to 10,000 people. Big Boss Man returned from Europe and continued to tour around England and Scotland. They were also asked to rework and remix tracks for Japanese sensation Mansfield for his Golden Hour album, and reworked Ingfried Hoffmann's 1960s/70s Euro-cult TV theme \\"Robbi, Tobbi und das Fliewat√º√ºt\\" for an EP released on Germany's Diggler Records.  2003  Big Boss Man returned to Europe and headlined nights at the Aucard de Tours festival and Cosmic Trip festival. They then had a two-week tour of Spain, took in headline cult festival slots and club gigs, and ended the tour on a high note with a sell-out show at Madrid's Sala Caracol venue.  2004  Paul Weller released a single called \\"The Bottle\\", which Big Boss Man dutifully remixed. Weller's single went straight in to the UK top 20. Two special limited edition versions of this single (vocal and instrumental) were released and it fast became a collectors item. Later the same year, Coca-Cola France requested the band's permission to use their second single \\"Big Boss Man\\" for promotional use. In May the band flew to France to play Cosmic Groove parties in Paris and Montpellier and in July, they touched down in Italy to play Festival Beat. Nasser Bouzida then toured Spain with a live revue of his spin-off solo album The Bongolian and was asked to guest with such luminaries as Woodstock's Country Joe and the Fish and 1960s British mod soul band The Action.  Winner  Big Boss Man released their second album, Winner, in April 2005. The album had a subtly different feel to the first record, due to its more apparent Latin feel, although the base elements of funk, jazz and soul are all still there, as are the cool sounds of the Hammond organ. No singles were released from the album. However, \\"Kelvin Stardust,\\" the first track of Winner, was included on the Soulshaker Volume 2 compilation album released by Blow Up Records in July of that year. To further differentiate from Humanize, the album featured more vocals (although still mostly instrumental) with four songs (\\"Fall In Fall Out,\\" \\"Complicated Lady,\\" \\"Reach Out\\" and \\"Got It So Bad\\") now sporting full lyrics. Winner also features some French vocals in the song \\"Tu as Gache Mon Talent Ma Cherie;\\" in true Big Boss Man style, the only lyrics are those in the title of the song. This French number was written possibly due to their large fan base in France, where Winner garnered wide radio play. To promote Winner, Big Boss Man embarked on a 12 date tour of France in the spring. They also returned to Spain for a 16 date autumn tour, including a second national TV appearance on the Spanish television show Radio 3. Possibly related to this, at the end of the song \\"Jackson 16,\\" there appears to be a clip from either a Spanish radio or TV show. Club favourite \\"The Hawk,\\" the 11th track from Winner, was included on Come On Soul, an international compilation of vintage and contemporary dance floor tracks released by the Legre record label in Hamburg in 2008.  Full English Beat Breakfast  Full English Beat Breakfast, released in September 2009, is by far the band's most ambitious project yet, using more synthesisers than previously, showing the boys are still writing good songs as proved with \\"C'est Moi.\\"  Last Man on Earth  Last Man On Earth, released September 2014 is the fourth album from Big Boss Man: 15 new recordings available on 180g heavy-weight vinyl LP, CD and digital. The band take a fresh approach to the BBM sound - their hip hybrid of Latin, jazz, soul, psych rock and 1960s/'70s drenched R&B; is now expanded with the added dimension of a brass section and guest vocalists adding to the further sonic and rhythmic explorations from the band, taking us on one heck of a brand new trip! It includes the single \\"Aardvark,\\" a jazz dance floor filler, rush released fresh from the studio mix sessions in April, that received strong radio support from BBC 6 Music and BBCRadio 2, including multiple spins by Craig Charles on his Funk and Soul Show, who declared that \\"I've been a big fan of Big Boss Man for many years. Big Boss Man 'Aardvark'. Double Groovy!\\" Additional radio plays came also from Cerys Matthews, Gideon Coe, Tom Ravenscroft, Chris Hawkins and Huey Morgan at the stations.

Football career Wilcox was born in Walsall, Worcestershire and joined Aston Villa, initially as an amateur, in March 1906 before signing as a professional in November 1907. He only played six games in the Football League for Aston Villa, before joining Birmingham in a part- exchange deal involving George Travers in November 1908. He was a winger who enjoyed beating opposing defenders, and was a creator of chances for others rather than a goalscorer. He played 48 games for Birmingham in all competitions before moving on to Southampton in May 1911. Southampton's newly appointed manager, George Swift, spent a total of ¬£820 on transfers, recruiting eleven new players during May and June 1911. Wilcox was one of the few of these signings who did himself justice in the new season, which ended in a 16th-place finish in the Southern League resulting in Swift's resignation. Playing at outside-right, Wilcox possessed speed and was able to deliver a variety of crosses, and also had the ability to \\"manoeuvre astutely\\" to beat the opposing full-back.

History Britain and America The cover of a confession album from the late 1860s The origins of the confession album are unclear. Samantha Matthews notes the similarity to oracle games of the first half of the nineteenth century (she cites examples from 1810 to 1852). These interactive books, which bore titles such as The Young Lady's Oracle: A Fireside Amusement, included questions that resemble those of the confession albums (for instance \\"Which is your favourite flower?\\", \\"Which is your favourite historical character?\\"), including sexually distinguished questions appropriate to courtship (for instance, \\"What is the character of your lady love?\\", \\"What is the character of him you love?\\").Matthews (2000), 126-30. Whatever their origins, confession albums were an established form by the 1860s: Henry d'Ideville records using an album in 1861 (see Germany and France below); Karl Marx filled out answers to one in the spring of 1865 (his favourite colour was red); and Friedrich Engels answered another in 1868 (his idea of happiness was Ch√¢teau Margaux 1848).Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Collected Works, London: Lawrence and Wishart, vol. 42 (1987), 567 and 674 (Marx); vol 43 (1988), 541 (Engels). For online transcriptions of the Marx and Engels confessions, and a reproduction of his entry in Jenny's confession book, see External links. Marx filled out answers on two other occasions, including one for his daughter Jenny's confession album, the book from which Engels' confession is taken. Omura et al. (2005) contains a facsimile of this album with some commentary and a (slightly inaccurate) transcription. Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be preprinted or handwritten.Kohlbecher (2007), 26. One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter Jenny, which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870. For some of these, she sent the questions to friends, asking them to fill them out and return them. Her comments in a letter of November 1865 suggest that she regarded the genre as a novelty:Omura et al. (2005), 24-5 > I have a whole book filled up in that way and the answers are very amusing > when compared with one another. These Confession books have put albums and > stamp books quite into the shade. ‚Ä¶ I should much like to have answers. It > is more interesting and amusing than a mere Autograph. By the end of the decade, the printed and bound confession book had been introduced. The earliest currently known example with a printed publication date is Mental Photographs, an album published in New York in 1869, which contained place for a photograph as well as the set of questions (a combination already found in Jenny Marx's album).R. Saxton (ed.), Mental Photographs. An Album for Confessions of Tastes, Habits and Convictions New York: Leypoldt & Holt (1869). See Kolhbecher (2007), 25-6; 28-9; 32. The questions elicited a satirical response from Mark Twain, \\"Mental Photographs\\", published in Mark Twain's Sketches, London: Routledge (1872), 148-9 (online at archive.org). The albums seem to have enjoyed their greatest popularity in the following decades, but to have become unfashionable by the early years of the twentieth century. At their height, confession albums were widespread enough that in 1883 Douglas Sladen could rely on readers' familiarity with the form to play on it with a poetical answer.D. A. B. Sladen, \\"A Confession. (Written for a Lady's Character Book)\\" in Australian Lyrics, Melbourne and Sydney: George Robertson (1883), 39-40. The poem is quoted and discussed in Matthews (2000), 139-40. He begins: > My favorite virtue, I confess, is chivalrous devotedness, > My favorite quality in man, the manful genius that can > With iron will and eye sublime, up to the heights of empire climb; > Although in woman, as I think, gentleness is perfection's pink This ubiquity was accompanied by a certain exasperation. In a novel of 1886, a character asks:Annie G. Savigny, A heart-song of to-day (disturbed by fire from the 'unruly member'), Toronto: Hunter Rose (1886), Chapter 31 (online at Project Gutenberg). \\"A propos of the confessional, did any of you ever come under the torture of that modern Inquisition, the 'Confession Book?'\\" Early twentieth century writers look back on the books as a long unfashionable genre. A writer in 1915 records:C.F. Really & Truly: A Book of Literary Confessions: Designed by a Late-Victorian London: Arthur L. Humphreys (1915), 7, cited in Matthews (2000), 132. > So far as I can recollect it was voted a bore at the end of the 'seventies > and, except in suburban homes, such as my own, was never referred to except > with a yawn or a smile after the early eighties. The Daily Chronicle in 1906 remarks:Quoted in the Oxford English Dictionary s.v. \\"confession\\" III.9 and in Matthews (2000), 132; similarly Jerome K. Jerome, Idle Ideas in 1905 London: Hurst & Brackett (1905), 25, speculates about a future revival of the \\"old confession book\\". \\"'If not yourself, who would you rather be?' was a favourite question of the confession album of the seventies.\\" A. A. Milne (1882‚Äì1956) looked back in 1921 on the album as something from his childhood:A. A. Milne, Not that it Matters, London: Methuen (1921), 79. > The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is twenty years since I > have seen one. As a boy I told some inquisitive owner what was my favourite > food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero in real life and in fiction, my > favourite virtue in woman, and so forth. Some album producers saw World War I as an opportunity to revive the confession book. The new albums, unlike their Victorian predecessors, ignored questions appropriate to courtship. They were clearly intended to be filled out by soldiers, a point spelt out in the title of one: My Brave Friend's Confession Book (1915).Matthews (2000), 132; 147-51. Germany and France According to Henry d'Ideville, he had an \\"album-questionnaire\\" in which he collected the responses of friends and acquaintances in 1861, when as a diplomat in Naples he took the answers of Urbano Rattazzi and Mme de Solms, which he reproduces. His account, written in 1872, explains the nature of the album, as though he did not expect readers to be familiar with it:H. d'Ideville, Journal d'un diplomate en Italie, Notes intimes pour servir √† l'historie du second empire, Turin 1859-1862, Paris: Hachette, 1872, 101 \\"Voici en quoi consiste l'op√©ration: On adresse au malheureux interrog√© une s√©rie de questions auxquelles il doit r√©pondre successivement. ‚Äì Quel po√´te? quelle occupation? quel plaisir? quelle sensation, etc., etc., pr√©f√©rez-vous? Les r√©ponses sont inscrites, puis la personne signe, date son interrogatoire et le tour est jou√©.\\" > Here is what the operation consists of: you pose a series of questions to > the unfortunate subject of the interrogation and he has to answer them one > after the other. ‚Äì What poet, what painter, what occupation, what pleasure, > what sensation, etc. etc. do you prefer? The answers are written down, then > the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over. British confession albums also circulated on the continent (see Questions above), and (perhaps in imitation of them) there were also questionnaire books in other languages. In Germany there were several, notably Erkenne Dich Selbst! (\\"Know Yourself\\"), which first appeared in 1878 and survived to around 1900, going through at least 22 impressions, produced by Friedrich Kirchner (1848‚Äì1900). The Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung, which belonged to the same publishers as Kirchner's album, set his questions to celebrities, a forerunner of the modern use as the Proust Questionnaire; facsimiles of these answers were in turn printed in the album. In France, two are known, both containing the word Confidences in the title to represent the English \\"confessions\\". Here too the Revue illustr√©e set confession album questions to the famous, including Zola and Verlaine.Kohlbecher (2007), 28-9; 33-4. Revivals Friendship books In the Netherlands, where autograph books are very popular among young schoolchildren, publishers have recently started bringing out an alternative in the so-called vriendenboek or vriendjesboek (\\"Friends book\\"), which much like the confession album come preprinted with a set of questions about the respondents' hobbies, idols and wishes. Some children prefer the new format, which says more about the person answering, but most prefer the traditional autograph book, which leaves more room for their own creativity.M. Van den Berg, \\"Zur Erinnerung, Poesiealben aus Flandern\\", Acta Ethnographica Hungarica 44 (1999), 247-59 (on this point 249). The modern German Freundschaftsbuch (\\"Friendship book\\") has the same kind of preprinted questions and is typically aimed at the same age group.For instance Pettersson und Findus - Alle meine Freunde, illustrated by Sven Nordquist, Oetinger (2005), Proust Questionnaire In 1886, Marcel Proust, then a child of fourteen, filled out the answers to an English confession album, which bore the title Confessions. An Album to Record Thoughts, Feelings, &c.; (his answers were auctioned in 2003 for $34,000).L. Van Gelder, \\"Arts briefing\\", New York Times, May 5, 2003. Interest in Proust led to a later revival of the questions as a kind of formulaic interview for celebrities, first by L√©once Peillard in France in the 1950s, later in French and American television and in the magazine of the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, starting in 1980,Kohlbecher (2007), 25; 29. and in Vanity Fair since 1993, under the name of \\"The Proust Questionnaire\\", which disguises its unintellectual British origins.\\"Proust Questionnaire\\". This use too had been anticipated by nineteenth century journals (see Germany and France). Slam Books A slam book is a notebook (commonly the spiral-bound type) which is passed among children and teenagers. The keeper of the book starts by posing a question (which may be on any subject) and the book is then passed round for each contributor to fill in their own answer to the question.

Educational Service Units were created by the Nebraska Legislature in 1965 as cooperative programs to make services more cost effective for school districts. There are currently 17 ESUs providing services to 261 public school districts. Educational Service Units provide core services for school districts, which include staff development, technology, and instructional materials. Beyond the core services, ESUs determine the services to be offered based on the needs of their member school districts. Regional service agencies are present in over half of U.S. states. The method of selecting the board varies, but most are either elected by the public or selected by local school boards. A more in-depth analysis of the selection process is contained in the section on Governance. In addition to regional service agencies, county or regional superintendents are publicly elected in parts of Arizona, California, Illinois, and Montana. In New Jersey, county superintendents are appointed by the chief state school officer, and in North Dakota by county commissioners. Nebraska allows for county school administrators to be appointed by county boards, but eliminated the elected office of county superintendent as of June 30, 2000. Educational Service Units have been studied on several occasions. The most significant studies were in 1986 by the Legislature and in 1995 by the Department of Education. This review builds on the prior studies and examines the current status of ESUs, including changes implemented as a result of the preceding efforts. The study was conducted by a staff group consisting of legislative staff from the Education Committee, staff from the offices of members of the Education Committee, and staff from the Legislative Fiscal Office. The staff group conducted the study using several methods. First historical research was done beginning with the prior studies and building on the information they provided. The Legislative Fiscal Office provided updated financial information. Internet resources were used to derive national information. The staff group then visited six ESUs, met with representatives from seven additional ESUs, and invited the other four ESUs to provide input. The staff group also gathered information through surveys sent to each ESU and each school district. The surveys replicated the surveys from 1986 and 1995. However, the redundancy of the responses on the ESU surveys in this study indicated efforts by a number of the ESUs to coordinate their answers. This effort compromised the quality of information by limiting the perspectives that were shared with the study group. The ESU survey utilized open-ended questions, resulting in a narrative description, rather than a quantitative summary. This report looks at four categories of issues: Boundaries, Governance, Finance, and Services. The report is organized according to those categories. Under each category is a background section, a section discussing potential issues, and a section indicating possible changes. The potential issues and possible changes do not necessarily reflect the views of the staff group that compiled this report or the views of the Education Committee, but rather represent concerns and ideas that have been brought forward over time or in the process of this study. The statutory requirements governing ESUs are generally contained in the Educational Service Units Act. However, as a political subdivision other provisions also apply, such as the Nebraska Budget Act, the Elections Act, and the Interlocal Cooperation Act. The Department of Education has also issued two rules regarding ESUs. Rule 84 is the accreditation rule for ESUs. Rule 85 provides the procedures for ESU reorganizations. In the visits to ESUs and with ESU staffs, there was generally an eagerness to show how much had been accomplished with limited funding. There was a definite emphasis on economic efficiency and the delivery of services. However, a major concern for most ESUs was the inability to provide more services due to financial constraints.

It is surrounded by the Diablerets Massif, its peak (Sommet des Diablerets at ) is the highest point in western Switzerland. The village lies at an altitude of on the north side of the massif of the Diablerets in the Swiss Alps. It can be accessed by train (Chemin de fer Aigle-Sepey- Diablerets) or by road from Aigle. The Col du Pillon (1,546 m) on the east give access to the Bernese Oberland region and is the Glacier 3000 cable car lowest station. The resort has a ski school, hotels and a small town centre. Les Diablerets is known for its traditional mountain architecture.  Skiing  Les Diablerets has three main ski areas: Scex Rouge (marketed as Glacier 3000) consists of beginner and intermediate slopes at its highest altitudes with more challenging pistes such as Martisburg further down the mountain. Glacier 3000 is also home to the infamous Combe d'Audon which sweeps past the summit of Oldehorn (3,122m) and drops down to the valley below at Reusch. Aside from skiing, Glacier 3000 is home to \\"Peak Walk by Tissot\\" - the only peak to peak suspension bridge in the world, the Alpine Coaster and Dog Sled trips. The Isenau sector is known for wide, sweeping slopes suitable for beginners and the sector's all-day sunshine ensures its popularity. As well as pistes at the top of the area there is a run down to the village and a long run down to the Col du Pillon - the first station of the Glacier 3000 cable car. The Meilleret area is on the slopes to the south east of the village. The area is Diableret's connection to the extensive Villars/Gryon/Diablerets ski area. Meilleret has the longest sledge run in Europe from its summit down to the village via the Col de la Croix. The slopes of Meilleret hosted the alpine skiing events of the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.

Delivered in 80 BC, it was Cicero's first major public case. It is also his second-earliest surviving speech (after the pro Quinctio). Background Cicero's narrative, outlining the 'pact' (societas) centred around Chrysogonus, is the basis for our understanding of the events leading up to the trial. It is worth remembering, however, that we only have Cicero's version, and some scholars have questioned the truthfulness of his account.References in Dyck, Cicero: pro Sexto Roscio, pp. 4‚Äì12, 17‚Äì19 For example, in his authoritative commentary on the speech, Andrew Dyck believes that Roscius Capito's involvement in the 'pact' was minimal, with Cicero's only tangible connection between Capito and Roscius Magnus being the fact that Magnus' messenger, Mallius Glaucia, allegedly went straight to Capito to report the crime.Dyck, Cicero: pro Sexto Roscio, pp. 8‚Äì9, 18 Summarising his views on Cicero's case, Dyck writes:Dyck, Cicero: pro Sexto Roscio, p. 17 > C. [= Cicero] criticizes the prosecutor, Gaius Erucius, for presenting a > weak case ... In fact, C. himself did not have much material; the only > evidence he adduces is a decree passed by the decurions of Ameria declaring > that the elder Roscius was wrongly proscribed and the son should receive his > property back. He hold no witnesses in prospect, merely trying to intimidate > a prospective prosecution witness ... In fact, C.'s lengthy speech in > defense of his client is mostly the product of his imagination, deployed to > derive maximum advantage from scanty materials. Murder of Sex. Roscius senior The elder Sextus Roscius was a wealthy landowner and distinguished citizen of Ameria, a municipium in southern Umbria. He had influential connections in Rome, most notably with the prestigious Caecilii Metelli, and, according to Cicero, he had supported the cause of Sulla during the civil wars of the 80s.Freese, Cicero's Speeches, p. 113 In 82 BC, Sulla successfully became dictator, and initiated a series of state-sanctioned murders known as the proscriptions. The consequences of being proscribed included the death sentence, and the public auction of all property belonging to the proscribed.Plutarch, Sulla 33.2 Sulla set the end-date for the proscriptions as 1 June 81 BC, after which time no more names could be added to the list.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 128 A few months after 1 June 81 BC, the elder Sextus Roscius was murdered near the Pallacine Baths in Rome while returning from a party. His son, Sextus Roscius the younger, was in Ameria at the time: however, a certain relative from Ameria, Titus Roscius Magnus, was present at Rome. For some time before 81 BC, Roscius Magnus and another relative, Titus Roscius Capito, had been engaged in a property dispute with the elder Sextus Roscius.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 87 Immediately upon hearing of the murder, Roscius Magnus sent a messenger, a certain Mallius Glaucia, to Ameria ‚Äì however, not to the younger Sextus Roscius, but to Roscius Capito.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 19, 96‚Äì9 According to Cicero, Roscius Capito then sent word to Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus, a powerful freedman of Sulla, who was at his camp besieging the rebel town of Volaterrae.Dyck, Cicero: Pro Sexto Roscio, pp. 4‚Äì10 Proscription and sale of property After hearing of the murder, Chrysogonus entered the elder Sextus Roscius onto the list of the proscribed, even though the official terminus of 1 June had passed. Chrysogonus then proceeded to auction Sextus' thirteen estates, reportedly worth around 6 million sesterces.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 6 According to Cicero, no one dared bid against the powerful Chrysogonus: as a result, Chrysogonus himself purchased the entire property for a mere 2000 sesterces.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 6 Crucially, Chrysogonus now named Roscius Magnus as his agent (procurator) in the purchase, meaning he took over ten of the estates on Chrysogonus' behalf.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 21, 23 Roscius Magnus proceeded to evict the younger Sextus Roscius from his father's property. According to Cicero, all these events took place within a span of only nine days after the murder.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 23 Embassy, flight, and trial Outraged at the eviction of the younger Sextus Roscius, the decuriones of Ameria sent an embassy of ten prominent men (decem primi) to Sulla's camp at Volaterrae. However, Roscius Capito was included among the ten: and, according to Cicero, he secretly convinced Chrysogonus to grant him the remaining three of Sextus Roscius' estates.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 17, 21, 108, 115 In return for this, Capito allegedly derailed the embassy by granting them false assurances that Chrysogonus would restore Sextus Roscius' property. As a result, the embassy left without ever meeting Sulla.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 26Dyck, Cicero: Pro Sexto Roscio, p. 9 Fearful that the 'conspirators' would murder him too, the younger Sextus Roscius now fled to Rome. He sheltered in the house of a Caecilia Metella, who is probably to be identified as Caecilia Metella Balearica, the possible wife of Appius Claudius Pulcher.Dyck, Cicero: Pro Sexto Roscio, p. 202 In addition, Sextus enlisted the aid of several young nobles, including Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger, a Marcus Caecilius Metellus, and Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica (the father of Metellus Scipio).Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 4, 77, 149 It was at this point, in 80 BC, that the three 'conspirators' decided to prosecute the younger Sextus Roscius, accusing him of murdering his father. They hired Gaius Erucius, a well-known professional prosecutor (accusator), and allegedly also bribed some witnesses to attest against Sextus. In addition, Roscius Magnus - who was now in charge of all of Sextus Roscius' property on behalf of Chrysogonus, including his slaves ‚Äì refused to allow two slaves who had witnessed the murder to give evidence (under torture, as was the custom for testifying slaves).Freese, Cicero: the Speeches, p. 116 Sextus Roscius hired Cicero, who was aged only 26.Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 15.28.3 Although Cicero had represented several clients in private civil cases, he had never undertaken a public case before: and his own explanation was that Sextus was unable to find anyone else to represent him, as everyone was terrified of Chrysogonus and his connections with Sulla.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 1‚Äì5 Trial The charge was patricide (parricidium), and was heard in Sulla's recently established court for poisoning and murder (quaestio de veneficiis et sicariis). The ancient punishment for patricide was infamous: the parricida was stripped, beaten, and sewn into a leather sack, allegedly containing a dog, a cock, a monkey, and a snake;Justin, Institutiones 4.18.6 the sack was then thrown into the River Tiber or the sea.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 71Freese, Cicero: the Speeches, pp. 120‚Äì121 It seems the prosecution based their argument upon the cui bono principle: namely, since Sextus Roscius had the most to gain from murdering his father, he was the most likely candidate.  Cicero's argument  After giving his own narrative (narratio) of events (¬∂15‚Äì29), Cicero splits his counter-argument into three main sections:Sedgwick, Cicero‚Äôs Conduct of the Case Pro Roscio 1.) Erucius' accusation of patricide is baseless (¬∂35‚Äì82); * the younger Sextus Roscius had no motive to kill his father, with whom he was on good terms; in particular, the father never planned to disinherit his son. * Sextus never had the opportunity to murder him, given that he was in Ameria at the time, and he lacked the connections or wherewithal to hire an assassin (sicarius). * Sextus is a virtuous and distinguished young man, making him an implausible murderer. * since patricide is such a serious allegation, it requires a high degree of proof ‚Äì which Erucius has entirely failed to produce. 2.) in fact, the murder was certainly arranged by the two T. Roscii, Magnus and Capito (¬∂83‚Äì121); * they had plenty of motivation for the murder. * they had the opportunity to arrange it, given that Magnus was in Rome at the time. * their conduct was very suspicious after the murder: for example, Magnus sent Mallius Glaucia straight to Capito instead of the younger Sextus; Capito deliberately sabotaged the embassy to prevent justice; and Magnus refused to allow two slaves to testify (under torture) as witnesses. 3.) and Chrysogonus is the mastermind behind the prosecution (¬∂122‚Äì142); * although he had no part in the murder, Chrysogonus was quickly brought into the conspiracy. * Chrysogonus illegally proscribed Sextus Roscius after the terminal date of 1 June 81 BC, and then bought the estates himself for a minuscule amount. * Chrysogonus ordered the prosecution of the younger Sextus Roscius, in order to remove the only potential competitor for the estates. * such treacherous conduct fits Chrysogonus' personality, since he lives a debauched, extravagant lifestyle.  Treatment of Sulla  At the end of the speech (peroratio), Cicero dramatically appeals to the jury of senators, calling on them to make an example of Chrysogonus: by rejecting him and his false accusations, they can enhance the cause of the nobility, and help end the lawlessness and corruption of the present times.Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 136‚Äì142 Although this involves explicit criticism of the proscriptions and the Sullan regime, Cicero is very careful to absolve Sulla himself of any blame.E.g. Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 6, 21‚Äì22, 131 He calls Sulla a 'most illustrious and valiant citizen' (viro clarissimo et fortissimo),Cicero, pro Roscio Amerino 6 and even compares Sulla to the all-powerful father of the gods, JupiterCicero, pro Roscio Amerino 131 ‚Äì though some scholars have seen this latter passage as 'ironic', 'insincere' or 'double-edged'.Dyck, Cicero: Pro Sexto Roscio, p. 186 Outcome and aftermath Cicero was successful, and Sextus Roscius was acquitted. However, since Cicero was only defending Sextus from the specific charge of patricide, it is not known if Sextus ever recovered his father's land.Lintott, Cicero as Evidence, p. 427 According to Cicero himself, the victory brought him great fame, and he was instantly considered one of the foremost advocates in Rome.Cicero, Brutus 312 Nevertheless, Cicero soon left the city to tour Greece and Asia Minor. Plutarch claims this journey was motivated by fear of Sulla,Plutarch, Life of Cicero 3.2‚Äì5 given that Cicero had challenged Chrysogonus and criticised the Sullan regime. However, Cicero himself states that the trip was to hone his skills as an orator and improve his weak physical fitness, and makes no reference to fear of Sulla.Cicero, Brutus 313‚Äì314 Looking back after nearly forty years, Cicero later felt embarrassed by the immature style and florid language he had used.Cicero, Orator 107 Nonetheless, he remained fond of the speech, and was particularly proud that he alone had been brave enough to challenge Chrysogonus contra L. Sullae dominantis opes ('in the face of the influence of Lucius Sulla the despot').Cicero, de Officiis 2.51  Scholarly observations of the speech   The legal dilemma  ‚ÄúThe Dilemma‚Äù of the speech as seen by W. B. Sedgwick is as follows: > ‚ÄúIf Roscius I (the father) was proscribed, Roscius II (the son) could not be > prosecuted for his murder; if he was not proscribed, the property was > illegally sold.‚Äù Sedgwick claimed in his 1934 article in The Classical Review that Cicero avoided addressing this dilemma because Chrysogonus had already removed the elder Sextus Roscius' name from the proscription list. Sedgwick claims that Chrysogonus promised the Amerian embassy to leave by promising to set everything right himself, and by taking the elder Roscius' name off the proscription lists as an act of good faith towards the delegation. This act on Chrysogonus‚Äô part necessitated the charge brought against the younger Roscius, in order to clear the former as well as the T. Roscii of all wrongdoing. Furthermore, Sedgwick claims that, with the younger Roscius removed, ‚Äúno questions would be asked.‚Äù Sedgwick Cicero‚Äôs Conduct of the Case Pro Roscio In an article written by T. E. Kinsey for Mnemosyne some thirty years later, Sedgwick's hypothesis is called into question. Kinsey distinguishes two different meanings for the word proscriptus, termed by Kinsey the ‚Äústrict sense‚Äù and the ‚Äúnarrow sense.‚Äù The ‚Äústrict sense‚Äù referred to those whose names had actually been written on the Lex de Proscriptione at the time of its original publication and proclamation. Regarding the ‚Äúnarrow sense‚Äù Kinsey proposes that, after the publication of the original law of proscriptions, Sulla and his close supporters kept a running list of enemies both alive and dead who were not included in the original law. Kinsey believes that the delegation of men from Ameria that went to Sulla's camp had no direct knowledge as to why the elder Roscius had been murdered and why his property had been seized. Kinsey states that the members of the delegation (except Capito) assumed that the elder Roscius had been proscriptus in the strict sense. When the delegation pressed Chrysogonus on this, the latter asserted that Roscius had mistakenly been proscriptus in the ‚Äúnarrow sense.‚Äù Chrysogonus, having appeased the delegation for the meantime, then went after the younger Roscius in an effort to end all speculation in the matter. Kinsey then goes on to address why Cicero did not employee the second part of the dilemma in his defence. Throughout his speech, Cicero consistently states that the younger Roscius only wished to be acquitted and that he will not seek to recover his inheritance. Kinsey proposes that many people had profited from the proscriptions (perhaps even members of the jury) and that the younger Roscius was less likely to be ‚Äúacquitted if it meant the beginning of a long period of reprisal and restitution.‚Äù Therefore, Chrysogonus along with anyone else who might have been nervous about the younger Sextus' acquittal would be reassured.Kinsey A Dilemma in Pro Roscio Ameria  Publication  There is some debate about whether the speech that is extant is the original speech. Some scholars believe that the extant speech varies considerably from the one given, mainly because Cicero was unlikely to have delivered such strong criticisms of Sulla in the oppressive climate of the time. Therefore, these criticisms must have been added by Cicero at a later date, perhaps 77 BC, after Sulla's death. However, others believe that the identified criticisms of Sulla \\"are, on the surface at least, complimentary\\".Kinsey, Cicero's Speech for Roscius of Ameria They suggest that the extant speech was written immediately after Cicero delivered it, exactly as given, to allow for some instances of improvisation. This theory is further countered by debate over the supposed \\"complimentary\\" passages as being actually ironically critical. The first theory gains further weight from the fact that Cicero later references his defence of Roscius as evidence of resisting dictators. This would indicate that some revisions may have been made to improve his image.Berry, \\"The Publication of Cicero's 'Pro Roscio Amerino'\\"  Urban vs. rural stereotypes  The allusion to the grace and virtue of a country life vs. the vice and corruption of an urban one are very common motifs in Cicero's defence of Roscius. He begins by parading the virtues of the hard-working farmer who was the very foundation of the glorious city of Rome. Here, he is appealing to the traditional historical account of the foundation of Rome. By tying his client in with the rural and his enemies with the urban, he conveys to his audience a stereotype that leaves his enemies suspect for their greedy amoral city ways. The idea of the virtuous farmer and vice-ridden city dweller serves as a whole-sale substitute for fact in his case against Magnus, Capito and by extension Chrysogonus.\\"Kinsey, Cicero's Speech for Roscius of Ameria Where most of the Roman audience would have assumed that a father who did not like his son would give him over to a farm, which was viewed as slave work, as punishment, Cicero paints the virtues of the farm in such a light as to assume that the elder Roscius liked his son, and thus endowed him with the wonderful responsibility that the farm represents: productive and self-sustaining. Cicero fails to produce much evidence, but denies the assumption that the father relegated his son to the farm because the younger Roscius had incurred too much debt.Sedgwick, Cicero‚Äôs Conduct of the Case Pro Roscio  Use of comic motifs in the speech  At one point during the speech, Cicero turns Erucius‚Äô argument for prosecution against him by utilizing a metaphor derived from the popular stage. Cicero refers to the comedic play Hypobolimaeus, rewritten by the Roman playwright Caecilius Statius from the original written by Menander, both now lost. The play's plot centres on a father with two sons, one of which remains of the farms in the countryside and the other stays with the father in the city. This situation matched Sextus Roscius‚Äô family situation, before his father's murder. The great advantage of using this play as a metaphor in Cicero's speech is explained by Byron Harries, who goes into great detail on the implications of the metaphor and its intended reaction among the jury. Harries also focuses on the relationship between comedic motifs in Roman plays and the Roman family.Harries Acting the part: techniques of the comedic stage in Cicero‚Äôs early speeches  Gladiatorial metaphors in the speech  August M. Imholtz, Jr. believed that Cicero's use of certain terms such as 'gladiator' and 'gladiator instructor' served as metaphors for assassin, executor and butcher. Many of the Latin words had etymologies coming directly from Etruscan, which Imholtz claims Cicero intentionally employed to heighten the dramatic effect of his speech. The intensity of the Latin oration, coupled with Cicero's intensely illustrative language regarding his characterization of Magnus and Capito, both greatly benefited Cicero's defence.Imholtz Gladiatorial Metaphors in Cicero's Pro Sex.

After a successful career as a child prodigy violinist and the Reger Prize from Berlin's Stern Conservatory, Golyshev became one of the founding members of the Dadaist November Group, painting \\"anti-art\\" works and creating music for kitchen utensils and various new, invented instruments. In 1933 he had to flee from the Nazis, first to Portugal, then to Barcelona, where he worked as a chemist until 1938. He spent World War II in France, either in prison or hiding. Between 1956 and 1966 Golyshev, lived in S√£o Paulo, where he influenced Brazil's M√∫sica Nova composers. He died in Paris in 1970. Golyshev the composer is notable for his only surviving composition, a string trio. This piece, subtitled Zw√∂lftondauer-Komplexe (twelve-tone-duration complexes), was published in 1925 in Berlin, but was possibly written as early as 1914. It makes use of various 12-note and 12-duration complexes, making it one of the earliest pieces of music composed using a variant of twelve-tone technique, and predating Olivier Messiaen's work. There are five movements, four provided with titles referencing their dynamics: # Mezzo-forte (Largo) # Fortissimo (Allegro) # Piano (Andante) # Pianissimo (Allegretto) # Adagio (Adagio) The dynamics in the last movement are left to the performers to decide on. Copies of the archival score can be ordered directly from Robert Lienau, the original publishers of the work. The rest of Golyshev's compositional output, which included two operas, romances, music for Vsevolod Pudovkin's lost film Igdenbu the Great Hunter, a string quartet and other pieces, is lost. Golyshev provided illustrations for Sensorialit√© Excentrique, the last book published by Raoul Hausmann in 1970.  References  * * Kholopov, Y.

It is a result of drying of the normally viscous colloidal mucus, commonly known as snot. Formation vestibule, in which dried nasal mucus can often be found The mucous membranes in the nasal cavity constantly produce a wet mucus that lines the cavity and removes dust and pathogens from the air flowing through. For the most part, the cilia that also line the cavity work to move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx where it can be swallowed. Not all of the mucus stays fluid enough to be moved by the cilia. The closer the mucus is to being in the nasal vestibule and near the nostril opening, the more moisture it loses to the outside air, and the more likely it is to dry out and become stuck. Eating Stefan Gates in his book Gastronaut discusses eating dried nasal mucus, and says that 44% of people he questioned said they had eaten their own dried nasal mucus in adulthood and said they liked it. As mucus filters airborne contaminants, eating it could be thought to be unhealthy; Gates comments that \\"our body has been built to consume snot\\", because the nasal mucus is normally swallowed after being moved inside by the motion of the cilia.

Though adult E. elaphi induce lesions in the blood vessels, and appear to activate the local immune response, they seldom cause overt clinical symptoms in their hosts. Discovery and nomenclature Elaeophora elaphi was first described in 1986, from specimens found in the hepatic blood vessels of Red deer (Cervus elaphus) from \\"Sierra Morena\\", C√≥rdoba, Spain. The \\"note added in proof\\" in that study mentions that similar worms were also found in sheep. Both male and female adults, as well as microcercariae dissected from the uterus of females were described. Hosts and geographic distribution So far, E. elaphi has only been described from Spain, in Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and a sheep (Ovis aries). Description and life cycle The life cycle of E. elaphi has not been studied in detail. However, the seasonal cycle of adult E. elaphi abundance in its host Cervus elaphus is similar to the seasonal abundance cycle of Elaeophora schneideri.Sant√≠n-Dur√°n, M., J.M. Alunda, J.M.

Their presence affects the blood vessels in several ways, including inflammation of veins (phlebitis), blood clots (thrombosis), and thickening of artery walls. They also appear to induce a local humoral immune response in the host, including production of lymphoid tissue and granulomatous lesions. These lesions are sometimes found in the absence of the parasites, or in the presence of dead, calcified E. elaphi. Reported rates of infestation vary from 6 to 41% of sampled deer.Sant√≠n-Dur√°n, M., J.M. Alunda, J.M. San Miguel, E.P. Hoberg, and C. De la Fuente (2000) \\"Elaeophorosis in Red Deer from Spain.\\" Journal of Wildlife Diseases 36(4):779-782.Carrasco, L., Y. Fierro, J.M. S√°nchez-Castillejo, M.J. Bautista, J.C.

The number of E. elaphi found per infested deer (intensity of infestation) ranges from 1 to 21, with averages of 8.5 and 9 in the two studies. Even though the deer in the study had the lesions mentioned above, none of them displayed any overt clinical symptoms. A red deer (Cervus elaphus) transported from Germany to Spain was not so fortunate. Six months after transport, it was found staggering and feverish; and it died the next day.H√∂fle, J., J. Vicente, D. Nagora, A. Hurtado, A. Pe√±a, J. de la Fuente, and C. Gortazas (2004) \\"The risks of translocating wildlife: Pathogenic infection with Theileria sp. and Elaeophora elaphi in an imported red deer.\\" Veterinary Pathology 126(3-4):387-395. Necropsy revealed 100 E. elaphi in its hepatic (liver) blood vessels - a much higher infestation intensity than was found in local deer - in addition to Theileria infection. Because E. elaphi has never been found in Germany, the authors suggest that this deer may not have developed a sufficient immune background to deal with E. elaphi infestation once it was relocated to the E. elaphi-endemic area of Spain.

Chatterjee set in 16th-century Asia against the background of the spice trade, piracy and the rise of various mystical religious cults. It traces the lives of four characters all of whom are in search of spiritual and material fulfilment embodied in the idea of the 'city of love'. The book was shortlisted for the Vodafone Crossword Book Award 2007. Plot summary The City of Love begins with the siege of Malacca by the Portuguese in 1510. Fernando Almenara is a Castilian trader captured in the abortive first siege of Malacca. Fernando has a secret: he is fleeing the Inquisition in Florence for his involvement with a Cabalist group there, and the invasion of Florence by the Holy Alliance in 1509 meant death to him and his friends. During the siege he is kidnapped by Daud Suleiman ibn Shams al Basri, a sharp young Arab physician and pirate based in Chittagong. Fernando joins Daud‚Äôs ship, the Shaan-e-Dariya, crewed by fugitives and renegades from all over the known world, and comes to their home port. Chandu Sadashiva is the son of a Shaiva priest exiled from Gaur, West Bengal to the wilds of rural Chittagong. His father Bhairavdas is determined to turn him into a powerful Tantric warrior against the foreign polluters of his land, but Chandu has other ideas. He forms a secret attachment with Bajja, a tribal girl eight years older than he is, who becomes his secret role model and ideal. Things fall apart when Bajja asks Chandu‚Äôs father to initiate her into the Tantra but he tries to seduce her and she escapes. Bitterly disappointed, she vows to find enlightenment or die by fasting at the cremation ground. Desperately ill from weeks of starvation, she is rescued by the wise woman Dhumavati who undertakes to train her. At first Fernando‚Äôs band of pirates does well from their excellent piratical harbour, but then the Portuguese come to Chittagong and change the rules with their cannon and brutal ways. The pirate band breaks up, Fernando runs from agents of the Inquisition and falls in love with Bajja deep in the forest. Bajja is being taught the Sahajiya Buddhist Tantra by Dhumavati, while Fernando has training in the Christian Cabala, and together he and Bajja teach each other about love and the lore. Meanwhile, thirteen- year-old Chandu and his father have set out for Gaur to begin Chandu‚Äôs formal training, but they are ambushed on the way, Bhairavdas is killed and Chandu wounded in the throat and sold into slavery. Daud, who is travelling with a wandering Sufi, rescues and heals him. Chandu, temporarily speechless, is apprenticed to a blacksmith and takes the name Kalketu, having lost his Brahminical heritage. He becomes an accomplished Sufi qawwal or devotional singer. Bajja is now wandering the countryside, teaching other Tantrics her wisdom in secret places, but she is becoming disillusioned with the way Dhumavati treats their followers. Finally Dhumavati persuades her to take part in a Tantric ritual which involves killing a child, and in disgust she gives up the life of a guru and disappears to seek her own truth. Fernando is crushed, and he returns to Chittagong where he agrees to return to Amsterdam with an old shipmate and join the Family of Love. In the background of Sher Shah Suri‚Äôs and Humayun‚Äôs invasions of Bengal (1538‚Äì1540), Chandu sets off to look for Bajja and finds her herding pigs on top of a desolate mountain in Assam. They speak of all that has befallen them, lie down and make love. The first part of the book is set against the spice trade from Antwerp to Indonesia, the greatest network of goods and ideas the world has ever known, and the struggle for supremacy in Chittagong between Bengal, Tripura and Arakan, and the Portuguese empire. In this cultural cauldron, established Hindu and Buddhist Tantric, Vaishnav and tribal traditions meet the three- centuries-old incursion of Islam and the dawning of contact with the West. Excerpt Daud had closed his eyes and sat with his hands folded in his lap, one hand sometimes softly tapping the other. Fernando closed his eyes too. At first he felt nothing, then subtly the music changed. Without the light and glitter to distract him, it seemed to reach inside the darkness behind his eyes and gently cut him loose from himself. Pir Baba‚Äôs voice wove like a hummingbird around a note, climbed, danced with another. He seemed to sing alone, though the others followed his lead and he courteously let them repeat what he sang. He led them to places of melody they could never have reached on their own, and yet he was always a step ahead of them, teaching, teasing. His voice sounded as though many years of waiting for an answer from God had put pain into it along with joy, as though it had become a direct channel for a longing that could never be assuaged. It was a strong voice because it had known weakness, and it took Fernando in the cup of its hands and bore him aloft into the sky.

In addition to its primary location at Port Hueneme, the division operates detachments at White Sands, New Mexico; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Louisville, Kentucky. History NSWC PHD was founded in 1963 as the Naval Ship Missile Systems Engineering Station. It was established to provide overall technical support for the new guided missiles‚ÄîRIM-2 Terrier, RIM-8 Talos and RIM-24 Tartar‚Äîthat were being introduced into the naval fleet. Port Hueneme was chosen as the site for this operation because of its deep water port, its proximity to the US Navy‚Äôs missile testing range at Point Mugu, California and the availability of space at the already operating Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme. Chartered as an In-Service Engineering Agent, the newly established organization emphasized onboard assistance to ship crews, analyzed problems and requirements and developed engineering and logistics improvements to the guided missile systems. The command‚Äôs engineering responsibilities soon expanded beyond missiles, assuming engineering work for many new weapon and combat systems used by the Navy‚Äôs surface fleet. The workforce also took on the responsibility of providing logistics support‚Äîreferring to the procurement, maintenance and transportation of what the fleet needed‚Äîincluding maintenance and repair, training manuals, essential spare parts, tools and test equipment. The command also adopted the program of underway replenishment, which allows ships to receive fuel, ammunition and supplies while at sea. The command supports new technologies and innovations to sustain a wide variety of weapon, combat and warfare systems. NSWC PHD is focusing its technical capabilities on next generation in-service engineering, which involves direct connectivity to the fleet on a global basis and the immediate availability of round-the-clock access to products, services and fleet support capabilities.

The two-cylinder saturated steam locomotives with inside cylinders had in addition to an inside bar frame a characteristic outer frame for the rear part of the locomotive, that partly covered the driving wheels. The valve gear was of the Joy type. In 1898 and 1899 Krauss initially built eleven locomotives; in 1904 a twelfth followed that was equipped with a Pielock superheater. Although the P 3s met their intended performance criteria, they were soon overtaxed by increasingly long trains. The Palatinate Railway decided therefore on an unusual conversion: in 1913 the two-cylinder engine was converted into a four-cylinder compound engine by the addition of two outside cylinders, the inner ones becoming the high-pressure cylinders. However they did not achieve the higher performance required, just a lower fuel consumption of around 15%. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over five of these locomotives as DRG Class 14.1 with numbers 14 101 to 14 105, but by 1926 they were retired from service. Also grouped into Class 14.1 were the Bavarian S 2/5s. The locomotives were equipped with tenders of the Bavarian Class 3 T 16.

Hosts and geographic distribution E. poeli has been found in several species of cattle: African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), Carabao or Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalus), and Zebu (Bos primigenius indicus). The geographic distribution of this species includes several Asian and African nations: Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, and Vietnam. Life cycle The life cycle of E. poeli is not known. The adults usually live attached to the inner walls of the aorta. They make aneurysmal (i.e. bulging) nodules in the wall of the aorta, which can be up to 2 cm in diameter.Tulloh, N.M. and J.H.G. Holmes (1992) Elaeophora poeli. In: \\"Buffalo Production.\\" Elsevier: Amsterdam. . pp. 344. The male lives curled up inside the nodule, while the female lives with its head in the nodule and its body free in the lumen (interior space) of the aorta. Presumably the female sheds the offspring (microfilariae) directly into the host's bloodstream. Adults have also been found in nodules on the epicardium of the heart.Bindernagel, J.A.

The latter study found narrowing of the aorta down to 1/3 of its usual diameter in some cases. Despite the presence of nodules 2-cm in diameter on aorta walls and heart tissue, and narrowing of the aorta, almost all studies of E. poeli infestation mention a lack of obvious clinical symptoms in infested individuals.

The band, who formed in 1972, didn't debut until five years later in 1977, when they released their debut studio album In the City, which entered at #20 place in the UK Albums Chart, and contained the title-track, \\"In the City\\". Their second album, This Is the Modern World, was the first to get into the Billboard 200 (US Albums Chart), taking its place at 201 while at 20 in the UK Albums Chart. Their most successful studio album was their final album The Gift in 1982 which took its place at Number #1 in the UK and at #82 in the US. The Jam were seen as the centre of mod revival culture during the 1970s to the 1980s, and the lead singer of the band, Paul Weller, was seen as The Modfather. The band separated in 1982, following ten years active, and five years of success. Shortly after the band's break-up, Weller went on to form The Style Council, before embarking on a solo career and releasing his first studio album, which was self-titled, in 1992.

The spacecraft is being designed to carry three people, and a planned upgraded version will be equipped with rendezvous and docking capability. In its maiden crewed mission, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s largely autonomous capsule will orbit the Earth at altitude for up to seven days with a two or three-person crew on board. The crewed vehicle is planned to be launched on ISRO's GSLV Mk III in December 2021.Gaganyaan mission to take Indian astronaut to space by 2022: PM Modi. The Hindu. 15 August 2018. This Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) manufactured crew module had its first un-crewed experimental flight on 18 December 2014. , design of the crew module has been completed. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will provide support for critical human-centric systems and technologies like space grade food, crew healthcare, radiation measurement and protection, parachutes for the safe recovery of the crew module and fire suppression system. On 11 June 2020, it was announced that while the first uncrewed Gaganyaan launch has been delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic in India, overall timeline for crewed launches is expected to remain unaffected.  History  Preliminary studies and technological development of Gaganyaan started in 2006 under the generic name \\"Orbital Vehicle\\". The plan was to design a simple capsule with an endurance of about a week in space, a capacity of two astronauts, and a splashdown landing after re-entry. The design was finalized by March 2008 and was submitted to the Government of India for funding. The funding for the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme was sanctioned in February 2009, but it fell short of full political support and obtained limited developmental funding. Initially, the first uncrewed flight of the orbital vehicle was proposed to be in 2013, then it was revised to 2016. However, in April 2012 it was reported that funding problems placed the future of the project in serious doubt; and in August 2013 it was announced that all crewed spaceflight efforts by India had been designated as being 'off ISRO's priority list'. By early 2014 the project was reconsidered and was one of the main beneficiaries of a substantial budget increase announced in February 2014.

India Today. 20 January 2019. ISRO will perform four biological and two physical science experiments related to micro-gravity during the Gaganyaan mission.  Funding and infrastructure  A crewed spacecraft would require about 124 billion (US$1.77 billion) over a period of seven years, including the 50 billion (US$0.7 billion) for the initial work of the crewed spacecraft during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007‚Äì12) out of which govt released 500 million (US$7 million) in 2007-08. In December 2018, the government approved further 100 billion (US$1.5 billion) for a 7-days crewed flight of 3 astronauts to take place by 2021. Madhavan Chandradathan, director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), stated that ISRO would need to set up an astronaut training facility in Bangalore. Newly established Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) will coordinate the IHSF efforts. Existing launch facilities will be upgraded for launches under Indian Human Spaceflight project with extra facilities needed for launch escape systems. Russia is likely to provide astronaut training, and assist with some aspects in the development of the launcher.Russia to Help India In 2022 Space Mission: Russian Envoy. NDTV. December 3, 2018. In spring 2009 the full-scale mock-up of crew capsule of Gaganyaan was built and delivered to Satish Dhawan Space Centre for training of astronauts. India has already successfully developed and tested several building blocks, including re-entry space capsule, pad abort test, safe crew ejection mechanism in case of rocket failure, flight suit developed by DEBEL and the powerful GSLV-MkIII launch vehicle.India's manned space mission is on, Cabinet okays Rs 10,000 crore plan, Economic Times, 28 Dec 2018. Having met all required technological keystones, the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme was accepted and formally announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 August 2018. Gaganyaan will be the first crewed spacecraft under this programme. ISRO's Human Space Flight Centre and Glavcosmos, which is a subsidiary of the Russian state corporation Roscosmos, signed an agreement on July 1, 2019 for cooperation in the selection, support, medical examination and space training of Indian astronauts. An ISRO Technical Liaison Unit (ITLU) will be set up in Moscow to facilitate the development of some key technologies and establishment of special facilities which are essential to support life in space. On 25 October 2019, ISRO's Human Space Flight Centre and Glavcosmos signed a contract to evaluate the possibility of using Russian life support systems and thermal control for Gaganyaan.  Description  Gaganyaan crew module is a fully autonomous spacecraft designed to carry a 3-member crew to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to seven days. Its service module is powered by liquid propellant engines. The crew module is mated to the service module, and together they constitute orbital module. The space capsule will have life support and environmental control systems. It will be equipped with emergency mission abort and emergency escape that can be done at the first stage or second stage of the rocket burn. The nose of the original version of the orbital vehicle was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts. Following two non-crewed orbital flight demonstrations of the spacecraft, a crewed Gaganyaan is slated to be launched on the GSLV Mk III launcher in late 2021. Though the spacecraft is designed to carry 3 people, it is likely that the first flight will carry one person only. About 16 minutes after liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, the rocket will inject the spacecraft into an orbit above Earth. When ready to land, its service module and solar panels will be disposed off before reentry. The capsule would return for a parachute splashdown in the Bay of Bengal. Crew module is equipped with two parachutes for redundancy, while one parachute is good enough for safe splashdown. The parachutes would reduce the speed of the crew module from over to under at splashdown.

Infestation usually occurs without significant health effects in the Greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), but may affect cardiac function in some other host species. Discovery and nomenclature This species was first described in 1907 from the heart of a Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) from Cameroon, and named Filaria sagitta. In 1926, it was transferred to the genus Cordophilus, as Cordophilus sagittus. In 1976, the genus Cordophilus was made a synonym of the genus Elaeophora, so this species became Elaeophora sagitta.Anderson, R.C. and O. Bain (1976) \\"CIH Keys to the Nematode Parasites of Vertebrates.\\" Commonwealth Agriculture Bureaux: Farnham, England, Vol. 3, pp. 59-116. Hosts and geographic distribution Adults of E. sagitta have been found attached to the inner walls of the chambers and vessels of the heart, as well as the arterioles of the lungs of various hosts: Bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), Greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus), nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), and African Forest Buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus). This species has also been found in unspecified \\"cattle\\". Lesions similar to those described in E. sagitta infestations were also found in sheep (Ovis aries), but the actual parasites were not recovered. E. sagitta has been found in several African nations: Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi, Mocambique, the Republic of the Congo, South Africa and Swaziland. Life cycle The life cycle of E. sagitta has not been studied in detail. It is viviparous, since the female sheds microfilariae, rather than eggs, directly into the blood stream. Prevalence Infestation rates as high as 74% and over 90% have been reported in free-ranging kudu. Infestation in a herd of eland (Taurotragus oryx) in Kruger National Park was reported as \\"nearly half of 33\\" individuals. A slaughterhouse survey in Swaziland yielded a very low prevalence‚Äì77 of 18,458 (0.416%) -- of bovine hearts showing lesions typical of E. sagitta infestation. In other host species, only isolated cases have been reported. Clinical significance E. sagitta adults are typically found in the heart ventricles, as well as coronary and pulmonary arteries, and occasionally coronary veins. They produce aneurysmal (bulging) lesions in the vessel walls which are 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter, and have been associated with hypertrophy and dilatation of heart ventricles, thrombosis (blood clots) and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle). The degree of interference with general circulatory function has not been studied in detail. As one author points out, however, if the infested host is fleeing from a lion, only a minor difference in cardiopulmonary efficiency could certainly affect survival. E. sagitta infestation appears to be clinically benign in greater kudu. Some fatalities in a herd of eland were attributed to E. sagitta infestation, though many of the eland were also \\"heavily\\" infested with various gastrointestinal parasites. In the Congo, E. sagitta infestation was suggested to be one of the factors which led to mortality in several bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus) and one African Forest Buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus)  References  Category:Spirurida Category:Parasitic nematodes of mammals Category:Veterinary helminthology Category:Bovine diseases Category:Fauna of Africa Category:Nematodes described in 1976 ","title":"Elaeophora sagitta"},{"id":"20329029","text":"Roland Povinelli (9 August 1941 ‚Äì 11 May 2020) was a French politician who served as a member of the Senate of France from 2008 to 2014, representing the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department.

The New York State Banking Department was the oldest bank regulatory agency in the United States. The Department was the primary regulator for state-licensed and state-chartered financial entities, including domestic banks, foreign agencies, branches and representative offices, savings institutions and trust companies, credit unions and other financial institutions operating in New York including mortgage bankers and brokers, check cashers, money transmitters, and licensed lenders, among others. Total assets of the institutions regulated were nearly $2.2 trillion. Effective October 3, 2011, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature consolidated the New York State Banking Department and the New York State Insurance Department and created the New York State Department of Financial Services.http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/history.htm  Mission  The Department's legislative mandate was to insure the safe and sound conduct of these businesses, to conserve assets, to prevent unsound and destructive competition, to maintain public confidence in the banking system, and to protect the public interest and the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. The New York State Banking Department was headquartered at One State Street in New York City and had an office in the state capital at the Empire State Plaza, Albany, and an office in Syracuse, New York to serve the most Northern and Western parts of the State.http://www.banking.state.ny.us/dep.htm Retrieved 2009-01-17. Revenues to fund the Department's operating budget were derived from fees paid to it by state-chartered institutions. The Department was included in the New York State Executive Budget, and all expenses were paid by the New York State Comptroller out of State funds, reimbursed by the amounts assessed against the institutions subject to supervision. Expenses of examination and operation were paid entirely by the institutions subject to regulation.  Employees  The Banking Department was headed by a Superintendent appointed by the Governor of New York. Almost 73 percent of the agency's nearly 600 full-time employees were bank examiners.  The Banking Board  The Banking Board was established in 1932 by N.Y.S. Banking Law ¬ß 13 and 14, and was a quasi- legislative body. The Banking Board was created to advise and cooperate with the Banking Department in the formulation of banking standards and regulations and to exercise power to approve or disapprove the issuance of bank charters and licenses and the establishment of branch banks. The Board's powers were broad and affected many aspects of banking supervision.http://www.banking.state.ny.us/bb.htm Retrieved 2009-01-17. In 2011, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature abolished the Banking Board as part of the consolidation of the Banking Department and New York State Insurance Department and the creation of the New York State Department of Financial Services. http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/history.htm Banking Board membership The Board had seventeen members. The Superintendent of Banks was the Board's chairperson and executive head. Each of the other 16 members were appointed by the governor and approved by the senate for a three-year term. Eight were public members, while the other eight had to have banking experience and had to represent various segments of the banking community.NYS Banking Law ¬ß13 Members with banking experience were selected, one from each of the following eight groups: Group one: banks, trust companies and private bankers located in the city of New York and having total assets of one billion dollars or more, as shown in their last report to the Superintendent. Group two: banks, trust companies and private bankers located outside the city of New York and having total assets of one hundred fifty million dollars or more, as shown in their last report to the Superintendent. Group three: banks, trust companies and private bankers other than those in group one and group two. Group four: savings banks located in the city of New York and the counties of Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk. Group five: savings banks other than those in group four. Group six: savings and loan associations. Group seven: credit unions. Group eight: foreign banking corporations licensed to maintain a branch or agency in the state. The member from this group must be a resident of the state but need not be a citizen of the United States.  Unique undertakings of the Banking Department  Banking Development District (BDD) Program: Section 96-d of the Banking Law, entitled 'Banking Development Districts' addresses a program created to encourage the establishment of bank branches in areas with a demonstrated need for banking services, with the goals of stimulating local economies and helping more New Yorkers enter the financial mainstream. Banks partner with local governments to establish a BDD in an under-banked neighborhood, and, when approved by the Banking Department, are eligible to receive municipal deposits at below-market interest rates from the State. The Enriched BDD program was launched in early 2005 to better coordinate the Banking Department and Comptroller‚Äôs Office with other community development and capacity-building initiatives. The Enriched BDD program also targets underbanked New York City neighborhoods and invites banks to apply for BDD branches in the pre-designated areas. Holocaust Claims Processing Office Created in 1997, the HCPO helps claimants from around the world obtain just resolution for the theft of property during the Holocaust-- specifically, assets deposited in European banks, monies never paid in connection with insurance policies issued by European insurers, and lost or looted art. HCPO is co-financed by the NYS Insurance Department, and has responded to over 10,600 inquiries, resulting in 4,746 claims from 44 states and 42 countries. http://www.claims.state.ny.us/hist.htm Criminal Investigations Bureau The Department's Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB) provides specialized investigatory capabilities with respect to allegations of criminal activity involving the financial industry and works cooperatively with law enforcement organizations at the local, state and federal levels. CIB also houses a team of examiners who specialize in compliance with anti-money- laundering laws, such as the bank Secrecy Act. This unit identifies and mitigates threats to the financial industry stemming from money laundering and terrorist financing. Mortgage Fraud Unit The Criminal Investigations Bureau has a Mortgage Fraud Unit. They conduct coordinated reviews with the Department of State, a HALT member agency that oversees real estate appraisers. The Department compiles data on New York mortgages and iensures that homeowners facing foreclosure receive information about available counseling services. The Department conducted several foreclosure forums in 2008. The Banking Department provided $2 million in grants for foreclosure prevention, with money provided from settlements received from prior predatory lending enforcement actions. New York participates in the National Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS), a state-run project that registers lenders. The department estimated that 20,000 lenders would be registered by January 2010.  Other activities  ATM inspections The Banking Department is responsible for inspecting ATM facilities for compliance with the requirements of the ATM Safety Act.NYS Banking Law ¬ß¬ß75-A to 75-O This includes requirements for surveillance cameras, adequate lighting, key-card access and an unobstructed view of the facility from the street. This law applies not only to state chartered entities, but to all federally chartered banks, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations or credit unions, as long as they operate one or more ATMs in New York, whether the entity is headquartered in New York or not. The Banking Department has 13 ATM safety inspectors. Name approvals Under Section 301 of the Business Corporation Law and analogous sections of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law,NYS Not-for-Profit Corporation Law ¬ß 301(a)(5)(B) the Limited Liability Company Law and Limited Partnership Act, the Banking Department and the Insurance Department (as appropriate) must approve the use of certain words (or abbreviations or derivatives thereof) in the name of an entity. The Banking Department approves the terms acceptance, bank, finance, investment, loan, mortgage, savings and trust. During the first 7 ¬Ω months of 2007, the Department ruled on over 600 such applications. Consumer services The mission of the Banking Department's Consumer Services Division is to ensure that regulated institutions abide by the consumer protection, fair lending and community reinvestment requirements of the Banking Law and regulations. The division also strives to increase consumer access to traditional banking services in under-served communities by administering the Department's Banking Development District program and other community development initiatives. Finally, the Consumer Services Division runs a consumer help unit to resolve problems between consumers and regulated entities. Consumer Help Unit CHU was created in May 2005 in order to give New York consumers a single point of contact for learning about important banking- related issues, making inquiries and filing complaints. Its management falls to the Deputy Superintendent of CMR.  Nature of state regulation  Regulation by the Banking Department begins with chartering, in the case of banks, trust companies and thrifts, licensing in the case of most other entities, and registration in the case of mortgage brokers. For all entities, it involves an evaluation of the character and fitness of incorporators (for chartered entities), directors and officers. For banking entities, it also involves requirements as to corporate governance and limitations on corporate powers. For most entities, it also involves financial requirements, such as a requirement as to minimum net capital. Banking organizations are also subject to restrictions on payment of dividends as well as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and loans to any one borrower. For all entities, it involves the requirement to maintain accurate books and records of its financial condition and transactions, as well as regular examination by the Department‚Äôs examination staff, which ranges from continuous on-site examination for the largest entities, to discrete examinations at appropriate intervals. NYS Banking Law ¬ß 36 Under the Banking Law, the Superintendent may require a regulated entity to appear and explain any apparent violation of law, issue an order directing a regulated entity to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices or to make good an impairment of capital or, in the case of a banking organization, required reserves, or to improve its recordkeeping. NYS Banking Law ¬ß 39 The Superintendent may take possession of and liquidate a banking organization and may suspend or revoke a certificate or license to do business or certain activities of a regulated non-banking entity. It holds in trust any unclaimed assets of a liquidated bank.NYS Banking Law ¬ß 30 Finally, under Section 44 of the Banking Law, following notice and a hearing, the Superintendent may impose penalties to be paid to the State.  Scope  The following is a brief description of each of type of entity regulated by the Department: Banks & trust companies The Banking Department charters and regulates banks and trust companies under Article III of the Banking Law. Historically, the Banking Department regulated both large domestic banks and smaller community and regional banks. However, the number of large domestic banks with state charters has been greatly reduced as a result of (i) mergers and (ii) ‚Äúflipping‚Äù to federal charters by banks with operations in numerous other states who wanted to take advantage of a single set of nationwide federal rules, rather than complying with the consumer protection laws of all 50 states. A trust company (which may be a stand-alone entity or be part of a bank that also conducts a general banking business) is an entity that is authorized by the Superintendent to exercise fiduciary (trust) powers. Budget planners A budget planner is a non-profit corporation that enters into a contract with a debtor under which the debtor agrees to pay a sum of money periodically to the budget planner, which the budget planner distributes among the debtor‚Äôs creditors. A budget planner also provides credit counseling and financial education. Section 456 of the General Business Law prohibits budget planning by anyone other than a non-profit corporation. Budget planners are licensed by the Banking Department under Article XII-C of the Banking Law. Check cashers A check casher is a person whose primary business is the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders for a fee. (A license is not required when a person cashes checks, drafts or money orders without charge, or when the person cashes checks, drafts or money orders as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged.) Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Banks under Article IX-A of the Banking Law. Credit unions There are two forms of credit unions under Article 11 of the Banking Law. A credit union is a non-stock corporation (i.e. a membership corporation) whose members must either have a common employer or be members of the same trade, industry, profession, club, union, society or other association. Credit unions accept deposits from, make loans to and issue credit cards to their members, among other things. A corporate credit union is a credit union whose members are primarily other credit unions. New York state-chartered credit unions are also regulated by the National Credit Union Administration, which also insures credit union share accounts up to certain limits. Foreign banks (branches, agencies and representative offices) A New York branch is an office of a foreign bank that is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct a banking business in New York. A branch may exercise the same powers as a state-chartered commercial bank, including accepting deposits, making loans, issuing letters of credit, dealing in foreign exchange, making acceptances and, if authorized, exercising fiduciary powers. There are two types of foreign branches ‚Äì insured and uninsured. An insured branch may conduct a retail banking business in New York, making consumer loans and accepting consumer deposits. An uninsured branch may accept deposits only as authorized by the FDIC Rules, with disclosure of their non- insured status. Since FDICIA was passed in 1991, no new insured branches have been allowed. A New York agency has many of the same powers as a branch, except in the case of deposits. An agency may issue large-denomination ($100,000 or over) CDs, may accept deposits from foreign residents and citizens and may maintain credit balances for customers incidental to its banking business. A foreign bank wishing merely to solicit business in the U.S. may establish a representative office to conduct research on the U.S. market and engage in marketing for the foreign bank. A representative office is not permitted to perform any core banking functions for the foreign bank or make any business decisions that would obligate the foreign bank, but it is permitted to engage in a number of activities not deemed to constitute the business of banking, including acting as liaison with customers and correspondents of the foreign bank, soliciting new business for the foreign bank, soliciting investors to buy loans from the foreign bank, and soliciting loans of $250,000 or more for the foreign bank. Branches and agencies are covered in Article V of the Banking Law. Representative offices are covered in Article V-B of the Banking Law. Since 1991, they have also been subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Holding companies For purposes of the Banking Law, a bank holding company is an entity (or natural person) that owns 10% or more of the voting stock, or otherwise controls, two or more New York banks or trust companies or national banks whose principal offices are located in New York State. Regulation of bank holding companies under Article III-A of the Banking Law is designed to prevent undue concentration of bank ownership. Consequently, unlike the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates all holding companies, even if they control only one bank, the Banking Department does not regulate one-bank holding companies. Investment companies (Article XII) An Article XII Investment company is a specialized non-depository lending institution that has broad borrowing and lending powers and may invest in stocks. An Article XII investment company may not accept ‚Äúdeposits‚Äù inside the U.S., although it may accept credit balances in New York that are incidental to the exercise of its other powers. Several foreign banks maintain Article XII investment companies. In addition, several large U.S. financial companies, including American Express, AIG, General Electric and Western Union, also have chartered Article XII investment companies. Licensed lenders A licensed lender is an entity engaged in the business of making loans in the principal amount of (i) $25,000 or less to any individual for personal, family, household, or investment purposes, or (ii) $50,000 or less for business and commercial loans, and which charges a rate of interest greater than 16% per annum. Money transmitters The business of money transmission includes the issuance and sale of traveler‚Äôs checks, issuance and sale of money orders, and the transmission of money on behalf of the public by any means including transmissions within this country or abroad by wire, check, draft, facsimile or courier. Generally, a money transmitter markets its services through a network of agents. Money transmitters are covered in Article XIII-B of the Banking Law. Mortgage bankers A mortgage banker is a person who engages in the business of making five or more mortgage loans in any one calendar year (other than certain exempted entities, including a banking organization and an insurance company). Mortgage bankers are subject to licensing by the Superintendent of Banks under Article XII-D of the Banking Law. Mortgage brokers A mortgage broker is a person who solicits, processes, places or negotiates a mortgage loan, but does not include a real estate broker or salesman, as defined in section 440 of the Real Property Law, if he does not directly or indirectly accept a fee for services rendered in connection with such solicitation, processing, placement or negotiation. Mortgage brokers are subject to registration by the Superintendent of banks under Article XII-D of the Banking Law. Mortgage loan originators Under legislation passed in 2006 regulates mortgage loan originators (MLOs), who are individuals employed by or who have an independent contractor relationship with licensed mortgage bankers or registered mortgage brokers and who assist customers by soliciting, negotiating, explaining or finalizing the terms of a mortgage loan. MLOs are subject to a criminal background check and must complete certain educational requirements. MLOs are assessed fees that cover the cost of administering the registration program. MLOs are covered by Article XII-E of the banking Law. Premium finance companies A premium finance company enters into premium finance agreements with an insured person or acquires premium finance agreements from insurance agents or brokers or other premium finance agencies. A premium finance agreement is an arrangement under which a premium finance agency or an insurance broker or agent advances funds to an insurance company to pay an insurance premium on behalf of the insured and receives repayment by the insured over a period of time. Under Article XII-B of the Banking Law, the Banking Department licenses insurance finance agencies and regulates the terms of the finance agreement. Private bankers A private bank is a bank owned by an individual or a partnership. A private bank may engage generally in the full range of commercial banking activities, as well as in investment banking activities. Safe deposit companies A safe deposit company acts as a custodian for storage of personal property and papers of any kind. It may also engage in the safe deposit business by renting vaults and safe deposit boxes. It cannot lend money or make advances on any property left in its possession. Safe Deposit Companies and the safe deposit business are covered in Articles VIII and VIII-A of the Banking Law. Sales finance companies A sales finance company acquires retail installment contracts or other credit agreements made by other parties. The term also includes a retail car dealer who holds retail installment contracts acquired from retail buyers, which have aggregate unpaid time balances of $25,000 or more. The term also includes a person who enters into retail installment credit agreements with retail buyers under Section 413(11) of the Personal Property Law. The Banking Department licenses persons to engage as sales finance companies (other than banks, savings bank, savings and loan associations, trust companies, private bankers or investment companies or licensed lenders) under Article XI-B of the Banking Law. Savings banks and savings & loan associations A savings bank or a savings and loan association is a type of financial institution whose main purpose is to take deposits from consumers and to make home mortgage loans or to invest in home mortgages. Some institutions also invest in commercial mortgages. Historically, savings banks were organized as mutual companies and savings and loan associations (S&Ls;) were organized as stock companies. Savings banks and S&Ls; are regulated, respectively, under Article 6 and Article 10 of the Banking Law. Deposits of each type of institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \\\\---- To view the alphabetical listing of the history of many of the Banks and Trust Companies, Savings Banks, Savings and Loans, Credit Unions, Investment Companies that are or were state chartered, as well as most federally chartered institutions that have operated in the state of New York go to http://www.banking.state.ny.us/history.htm  State regulator associations  National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors State credit union regulators formed NASCUS in 1965 to ensure the safety and soundness of state-chartered credit unions. NASCUS, a professional regulators association, is the primary resource and voice of the 48 state governmental and U.S. territorial agencies that charter, regulate and examine the nation‚Äôs state-chartered credit unions. (Delaware, South Dakota and Wyoming have no laws permitting state-chartered credit unions.) NASCUS is the only organization dedicated to the defense and promotion of the dual chartering system and the autonomy of state credit union regulatory agencies.‚Äù Today, NASCUS also represents the interests of state agencies before Congress and is the liaison to federal agencies, including the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). NCUA is the chartering authority for federal credit unions and the administrator of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), the insurer of most state-chartered credit unions. NASCUS also provides examiner education programs for state agencies. New York State Credit Union League Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) CSBS is a national advocate for the state banking system. Its membership consists of state bank regulators, commissioners, etc. from all 50 states. Its mission is to educate, coordinate, advocate and communicate for the advancement of the state banking system.

Istanbul - October 29, 1970 Antibes) was an Armenian architect, who designed buildings, interiors and gardens, and taught architecture. He worked in Europe, Iran and the USA. Biography Guevrekian was born by some accounts in 1900 article at Encyclopaedia Iranica (Imbert 1993, Turner 1996 ), by others in 1892 to Armenian parents. article at Architekturzentrum Wien He was born in Constantinople, present day Istanbul, and then moved with his family to Tehran where he grew up. In 1910 he moved to Vienna where he lived with his uncle, architect Alex Galoustian. He studied architecture at the Kunstgewerbeschule with Oskar Strnad and Josef Hoffmann from 1915, and received his diploma in 1919. He then worked with Strnad and Hoffmann until he moved to Paris in 1922. In Paris he worked with le Corbusier, Andr√© Lur√ßat, Sigfried Giedion and Henri Sauvage. He worked with Robert Mallet-Stevens from 1922 until 1926, where he worked on the designs for Rue Mallet-Stevens while also pursuing his own projects. Guevrekian worked as an independent architect in Paris from 1926. Compounds of the Foreign Ministry of Iran in which Guevrekian was their architectural planner Houses in Vienna Werkbundsiedlung, designed by Guevrekian He was actively involved in the early stages of the Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) which he chaired from 1928 until 1932, a position appointed him by le Corbusier (Turner 1996). He co-founded the magazine L‚Äôarchitecture d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui. Josef Frank invited him to design two houses for the Werkbundsiedlung in Vienna in 1932. thumb Kakh Shahrbani in Tehran Officers' Club in Tehran In 1933 he returned to Iran on invitation of the government. He designed governmental and public buildings, including Kakh Dadgostari Tehran, residences and villas, of which little is documented. He returned to Europe in 1937 and worked in London for three years, but due to the advent of World War II none of his projects were realised. 1940 he returned to Paris where he worked on the development of pre-fabricated housing while also teaching in Saarbr√ºcken. He then ceased work from 1940-44 refusing to work for the Nazis and the Vichy government in France. After the war he worked with Georges-Henri Pingusson on rebuilding Saarbr√ºcken and also taught architecture there. In 1948 he moved to the USA to teach at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. He became professor at the University of Illinois the next year, and taught there until his retirement in 1969. Guevrekian became a U.S.-citizen in 1955. After his retirement Gabriel Guevrekian returned to France with his wife. He died 29 October 1970 in Antibes.  Designs  Robert Mallet-Stevens had produced earlier works like les Roses Rouges which were hailed as jardin moderne and jardin d'avant garde. He also designed a garden for the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs. Through Mallet-Stevens, Guevrekian received an invitation to submit a modern rendering of the Persian Paradise Garden. (Wesley 1981 p. 17)  Garden of Water and Light  The Jardin d'Eau et de Lumiere for the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs was an equilateral triangle broken up into triangular elements. In the centre were four tiered reflecting pools decorated by Robert Delaunay that sat below a rotating, internally illuminated sphere. These were surrounded by tiered plantings and hemmed in by two low walls of small triangles of glass in white and shades of pink. The sphere and the reflecting surfaces meant that light was reflected in all directions within the garden. By night the internally illuminated sphere projected light outwards enlivening the composition. (Imbert 1993 p. 128, Adams 1993 p. 32, Dodds 2002 p. 185) Initially labelled in the press as a Persian garden, it eventually became referred to as the Cubist garden (Adams 1993 p. 30). For the same exposition, Guevrekian designed a pavilion for Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Heim. Cubist garden at Villa Noailles right His subsequent garden for Charles and Marie- Laure de Noailles at Villa Noailles had an imposed space whose triangular shape the clients and Mallet-Stevens viewed as suited to Guevrekian's new design style. Noailles had consulted both Mies van der Rohe and le Corbusier before employing Mallet-Stevens. He wanted artifice in his landscape. The Villa commanded great views of the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur and Noailles wished to contrast this strongly with an enclosed and architectonic ensemble that framed the natural whilst delineating ownership. (Imbert 1997 p. 130-132) The disregard for the needs of the plants in the Noailles garden and the differing growth rates soon disrupted the balance of the design and prompted Charles de Noailles, himself a famous amateur gardener, to replant the design entirely, not long after its instigation. It was, however, a progression on the Paris garden by its regard for physical occupation. Villa Heim For Jacques Heim Guevrekian designed Villa Heim, built 1927-1930. He also designed the interior and furniture, and a garden consisting of a series of rectangular terraces. Villa Heim featured in L'Illustration and L'Architecte. Guevrekian was well involved with the CIAM by this time and had shifted to a more functional style.Dodds, p. 198, quotes Guevrekian as saying: \\"Decoration that concerns the embellishment of objects of utility is anti-ethical to the work of art. In my judgment, wanting to decorate all manners of utilitarian objects is an inferior idea...Modern architecture is marked by a new organization of plan that is logical and necessary in response to the differing conditions of life\\" The house has since been modified extensively and has been split into two apartments.  Readings of his work  Whether that was the artist's intention, as for subsequent gardens, is hard to determine. As Imbert points out \\"due to the paucity of written evidence, the garden designers‚Äô intentions remain largely undocumented; that they appreciated the implications of the cubist movement for their field, however, is most certain. (Imbert 1997 p. 169) Criticisms of the work as being too literal a translation of, or direct reference to, cubist painting is both unfair and imperceptive (and usually based on Wesley's critique or similar ideas). Although his primary artistic medium was painting, Guevrekian designed with more influences than cubist painting and a greater understanding of modern media and techniques than he is often given credit for. George Dodds provides this reading of the Paradise garden; \\"Paradise garden are idealised and isolated enclaves in which a water element representing the four rivers of paradise divides the space into four equal precincts.\\" (Dodds 2002 p. 192) Given the very limited space that Guevrekian had to work with and the need for people to be able to parade past, Dodds reads the four reflection pools as being this element with the garden halved for convenience. \\"The early Mesopotamian settlers conceived of the sky as a triangle and depicted it as a mountain. The moon, which brought relief from the relentless sun, was depicted as a tree atop the mountain of the sky. As trees mark an oasis and the moon is a life-giver, so the sap of the moon- tree must be water ‚Äì the elixir of life.\\" (Dodds 2002 p. 192-193) Guevrekian uses the metal sphere as both representative of the moon and tree, a technique he uses in later designs. The tree feeds the \\"water\\" in the pools below and the plants beyond. Dodds also reads the form as being a \\"straight-up\\" axonometric rather than the \\"shallow and compressed\\" perspective that Wesley draws directly from Picasso. (Dodds 2002 p. 191) Guevrekian uses the axonometric, a popular architectural type where all measurements remain true in an idealised form. He develops this idea further with Robert and Sonia Delaunay, whose simultaneist art he draws upon and whom he later works with to form the purist movement.

He wrote, \\"The actual story of the events leading to the election is more complicated and interesting. Yes, South Africa suffered from economic sanctions. But it could have survived for many years before caving in; it forged clandestine trading arrangements with countries ranging from China to Israel, and its diamonds still found their way onto the fingers of brides all over the world. Civil unrest was widespread, but South Africa had a fearsome array of police and military forces to counter it. If white South Africa had been adamant, apartheid would still be law...None of those events are told in Mandela, which simplifies the transfer of power into a fable of black against white; it all but implies that de Klerk was unwilling to see power change hands.\\"Ebert, Roger.

South Carolina Federal is the largest, oldest, locally owned financial institution in the Charleston tri-county area. As of 2018, South Carolina Federal had over US$1.8 billion in assets and over 160,000 active members.http://www.scfederal.org/home/abo.abo_our. Retrieved Nov. 21, 2008. History South Carolina Federal originated on Jan. 31, 1936, at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (Charleston Navy Yard) in North Charleston, S.C., when fourteen Navy Shipyard workers each contributed $5 (for a total investment of $70) to create the Navy Yard Employees Credit Union. In 1960, the credit union changed its name to the Charleston Naval Shipyard (CNS) Federal Credit Union when its field of membership expanded to include Navy personnel who worked at the Navy Yard or were stationed/home-ported at the naval base. In 1965, CNS became the first credit union in South Carolina to have its own facility. By 1969, CNS opened its first branch on the Naval Station. Other branch locations quickly followed. During the 1980s, CNS capitalized on legal changes that enabled credit unions to serve as full- service financial institutions. The NCUA during this time also allowed credit unions to open their fields of membership to \\"unlike groups,\\" permitting CNS to accept members from groups or organizations beyond those associated with the Shipyard. These developments contributed to several smaller credit unions merging with CNS during the 80s. By the end of 1985, as CNS was nearing its 50th anniversary, it had assets of $221 million and served 103,844 members. The U.S. Navy closed the Charleston Naval Shipyard and naval base on April 1, 1994, but CNS' member base was robust enough that the credit union was able to withstand the loss. In recognition of the changed environment and the credit union's broad membership, CNS changed its name on August 9, 1994, to South Carolina Federal Credit Union. During the 1990s, South Carolina Federal expanded beyond the Charleston area for the first time, into Georgetown and Columbia, S.C. In 2003, South Carolina Federal changed its status from a select employer group to a community-chartered credit union. In May 2004, South Carolina Federal reached a major financial landmark when assets hit $1 billion.Dabney, Eric, et al. Historic South Carolina: An Illustrated History. San Antonio, Texas: The South Carolina Historical Society, 2006. Organization South Carolina Federal is a multiple common bond credit union. Credit unions are owned and governed by the people who use its services. Those people are called \\"members\\" and each member is an equal owner of the institution. Members elect and serve as the credit union's volunteer board of directors, which establishes and reviews policies, based on what is best for the collective membership. South Carolina Federal's Supervisory Committee, made up of volunteers appointed by the board, is responsible to ensure that the credit union's financial condition is presented accurately in financial statements and that management practices and procedures safeguard members' assets. South Carolina Federal is committed to giving back to the communities it serves. Through corporate social responsibility, civic memberships and the South Carolina Federal Credit Union Foundation, the credit union infuses nearly $400,000 back into the region each year. Membership Connect with South Carolina Federal Credit Union for products, services and financial literacy through family relationships, employers, geographic areas, or member associations. More than 160,000 people and $1.8 billion strong, the member-owned cooperative operates 20 offices in four major markets to include Charleston, Columbia, Georgetown, and Florence. Services South Carolina Federal is a full-service credit union that offers consumer and business products and services that are comparable to most larger financial institutions. Products and services include personal checking, savings, debit and credit cards and loans, and business checking, business savings, business debit and credit cards and business loans suitable for members who own small businesses. South Carolina Federal also offers free financial education workshops to its members, the public and businesses within its field of membership. South Carolina Federal has 17 financial centers and many, convenient ATMs throughout the state of South Carolina. Members also have free access to over 50,000 Allpoint network ATMs nationwide. South Carolina Federal offers online services and information 24-7 via its website, scfederal.org. Competition South Carolina Federal counts among its competitors other credit unions, such as Heritage Trust Federal Credit Union, and banks, such as South State Bank, that maintain a presence in the same local areas and offer a relatively comparable suite of products.

Recognize Trogon caligatus as a separate species from Trogon violaceus Behavior It nests in a wasp, ant or termite nest or a hole in a rotten tree, with a typical clutch of two or three white eggs. Gartered trogons feed on insects and small fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless. Description Chan Chich Lodge area - Belize Most trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. The gartered trogon is a relatively small species at about in length.Ridgely, R. S., & Greenfield, P. J. (2001). The Birds of Ecuador ‚Äì Field Guide. Cornell University Press. . The head and upper breast of the male are blue and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. A faint white line separates the breast from the orange-yellow underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white. The complete eye- ring is yellow. The female violaceous trogon resembles the male, but has a dark grey back, head and breast, and an incomplete white eye-ring. The shade of the blue of the head in the male differs between the violaceous trogon and the gartered trogon, but (disregarding their separate distributions) the voice is the main distinction between the two.

Biography 1965: Formation In early 1965, guitarists Joop Roelofs and Frank Nuyens joined with singer Willem Bieler to start the band. The line-up was completed with the addition of drummer Jay Baar, formerly of Leadbelly's Limited, and bass player Peter Vink. The band was inspired by rhythm and blues traditionals and the songs of Robert Johnson and Willie Dixon, as well as new bands, such as The Kinks, The Animals and The Rolling Stones. They started performing publicly in the Spring of 1965, and later that year, would start using the name, Q65. During a concert at skating ring De Eenhoorn, they met producer Peter Koelewijn. Very impressed by their show, he invited them to an audition at the Phonogram studio, where they recorded two of their own songs; \\"And Your Kind\\" and \\"You're The Victor\\". Koelewijn decided to release them on vinyl. 1966-1968: The Golden Years In January 1966, their debut single \\"You're The Victor\\" was released and later peaked at No. 11 on the Dutch Top 40. Then Hans van Hemert replaced Koelewijn. Two other singles reached the Dutch charts the same year; \\"The Life I Live\\" (No. 5) and \\"I Despise You\\" (No. 19). Under Van Hemert's guidance their first album entitled Revolution was released later that year by Decca Records, and became a hit, selling 35,000 in the Netherlands. In 1967, they hit the charts again with the singles \\"From Above\\" (No. 13) and \\"World of Birds\\" (No. 8). Due to drug problems and military service duties of singer Wim Bieler, Q65 disbanded in 1968. 1970s Q65 reformed in 1970, with Beer Klaasse on drums, and signed to Negram Records, staying together for several years. Their LPs of the early 70s, Afghanistan and We Are Gonna Make It had a more psychedelic orientation. Q65's line-up changed throughout the early 1970s. Nuyens exited in 1971 to join Baar in a band called Rainman,, while Q65 continued with a new line-up, featuring John Frederikz on vocals and Joop van Nimwegen on guitar. Wim Bieler left to form a band called Dambuster. Johnny Frederiksz was brought in as lead singer, but by then the band had changed their name to Kjoe. 1980s-2010s The original Q65 reunited in 1980 and toured throughout that year. The group continued with various different lineups in the mid-1980s. Jay Baar died in 1990, but a version of the band, with Wim Bieler as leader, continued playing into the 1990s. Bieler died in 2000. On October 2, 2018 Joop Roelofs, who played guitar and came up with the name of the group, died aged 74.

Plot In 1944, during the last stages of the war in Europe, American officers Paul MacDougall (Heston) and Joseph Angelico (Guardino) are sent to Rome to act as spies for the Allies, even though they have no experience in espionage. Working with Partisan resistance soldier Ciccio Massimo (Baccaloni), MacDougall and Contini send regular reports to their superiors by carrier pigeon. Angelico also finds himself falling in love with Massimo's pregnant daughter Rosalba (Pallotta), while her sister Antonella (Martinelli) has her eye on MacDougall. Angelico proposes to Rosalba, and Ciccio prepares a feast to celebrate his daughter's upcoming wedding. However, Ciccio prepares squab for the occasion, killing all but one of the carrier pigeons. Ciccio scrambles to replace them, but the new pigeons he finds are German, and they deliver MacDougall's and Angelico's messages directly into enemy hands, creating new confusion.

Stromquist House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is located on a ten-acre site in Bountiful, Utah. At an altitude of , it consists of the main house, an office/laboratory/garage annex, a gardener's shed and a barn. It is sited halfway down an arroyo or canyon wall. The house has an endless view of the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house on a grid of 60 and 120 degree angles which formed a series of parallelograms. The grid lines are poured in the concrete floors, and the ceiling has the same grid lines reflected in small strips of wood. The house is constructed from salmon colored concrete-blocks, steel beams, glass and Philippine mahogany. Wright drew up plans for the furniture, further unifying the look with a dining room table, the lines of which mirror the grid in the floor, built-in settees, lamp tables and book shelves. Freestanding furniture designed by Wright, included a coffee table and hassocks. Even the fireplace tools, with half-diamond shapes on the handles, were designed by the architect. Main structure The main house features three small bedrooms, two granite-clad (an addition Stromquist made after he repurchased the home) bathrooms, a kitchen, semi-formal dining, laundry, utility room, two fireplaces, and two balconies. Clerestory windows provide natural lighting. The master bedroom has its own fireplace and French doors that lead to a secluded balcony. Heating is provided by a combined radiant and forced-air system that utilizes two natural gas furnaces, which was designed by William Wesley \\"Wes\\" Peters, Wright's son-in-law and chief engineer. As a boy, Don Stromquist had attended a speech by Frank Lloyd Wright, and was impressed. When it was time for him to build a home, he asked Wright to design it. Construction on the home began in 1959 and was completed in 1961 at a cost of about $32,000, when Stromquist and his wife, Jane, were newlyweds. Wright died in 1959, before the house was completed. After living in the home for several years, the home was purchased by Mr. Stromquist's employer, U.S. Steel, when Mr. Stromquist's position was relocated to the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Thirty years later, the couple moved back to Utah to find that the house had been abandoned, vandalized, and eventually sold as horse property. George M. Frandsen and his partner, David A. Carlquist, both Utah natives, later bought the home and restored it to the details of the original architectural drawings. Taliesin Associated Architects John deKoven Hill and Cornelia Brierly oversaw the restoration. Breirly had been Wright's color and fabric consultant when the home was first designed. At the completion of the restoration she commented that the home was the best preserved example of Wright's Usonian architecture. During the ten years the home was owned by Frandsen and Carlquist, fundraising events were frequently held there to benefit local nonprofit organizations, including the couple's favorite, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The Stromquists were members of the ACLU and were invited to speak at a fundraising event held in the home and gardens. A friendship between the Stromquists and the men developed. Later, when the men decided to move from Utah, they sold the home to the Stromquists, who moved back into the house. Mrs. Stromquist died there a short time later. The home has been occupied by Don's son, George, since Don's death in 2009. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History At the time of the Norman conquest, Aston-on-Trent was part of the Manor of Weston which was granted by the Crown to the Earl of Chester and by him to the Abbey of St Werburgh at Chester. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Manor was granted to Sir William Paget. In 1612 Weston passed to Anthony Roper by marriage and in 1633 he purchased the house and estate at Aston. In 1648 he sold the estate to Robert Holden of Shardlow. His descendant, also Robert Holden, was a successful lawyer who replaced the old house with a new red brick three storey five bayed mansion in 1735. The house was greatly extended by the addition of a substantial north wing and other improvements by Edward Anthony Holden who was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1838. Holden's daughter Mary Shuttleworth Boden was born here in 1840. She was a noted temperance campaigner and a she gave Derby its first children's playground. The estate was sold by the Holdens in 1898 to William Dicken Winterbottom, who enlarged the Hall in 1907 and engaged Thomas Hayton Mawson to redesign the garden. After Winterbottom's death in 1924 it was broken up and the house was sold to Nottingham County Council and became Nottingham Corporation Home for Mental Deficients in about 1930. After joining the National Health Service in 1948, it became known as Aston Hall Hospital. A report published in July 2018 referred to allegations of abuse at the hospital in the 1960s and 1970s. From 1974 to closure it was operated by South Derbyshire District Health Authority. The hospital closed in about 1993 and more recently the hall has been restored, renovated and converted into residential apartments.

This model was validated in experiments with thyroid disease tissue. From 1984 he collaborated with Ravinder N. Maini at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology to study disease mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the population. Feldmann's group demonstrated that diseased joints have far more pro- inflammatory cytokines than normal, and identified one of these, tumour necrosis factor alpha, (abbreviated TNFŒ±) as the key.Feldmann, M., Brennan, F.M. and Maini, R.N.

She was built in 1967 by the W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland as Finlandia for the Finland Steamship Company. In 1975 she was sold to Finnlines, who converted her into the cruise ship Finnstar in 1978. In 1982 she entered service for Pearl Cruises as Pearl of Scandinavia. In 1988 she was renamed Ocean Pearl. In 1994 she entered service with Croisi√®res Paquet as Pearl. Between 1995 and 1998 she sailed for Costa Cruises as Costa Playa. In 1998-1999 she sailed as Oriental Pearl for Mega Wave International, and in 1999-2000 as Joy Wave for Costa Cruises. In 2000 she was sold to Eurasia International and entered service under the name Golden Princess . In 2009 she was sold for scrap to China. Concept and construction During the early 1960s Finland Steamship Company's service between Finland, Denmark and West Germany was operated by ageing steamers with no car decks, the newest of which had been built in 1927. Finnlines had started competing with Finland SS Co on the service to West Germany in 1962 with the car/passenger ferry Hansa Express. Two notably larger ferries‚ÄîFinnhansa and Finnpartner‚Äîwere under construction, due to enter service on the service with Finnlines in 1966. In order to compete with Finnlines' state-of-the-art ferries, Finland SS Co placed an order for an even larger car/passenger ferry with W√§rtsil√§ Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland on 8 April 1965. The new ship could accommodate 1000 passengers, with berths for 647 of them. In keeping with the liner tradition the berths were divided between first and tourist class. The same shipyard was in fact building the new Finnlines vessels at the time Finland SS Co placed their order. The concept of the new Finland SS Co vessel, eventually to be named Finlandia, was essentially the same as that of Ilmatar, built by the W√§rtsil√§ shipyard for Finland SS Co in 1964. A notable exception was that the new Finlandia would be built with a full-length car-deck that could be accessed from gates both in the stern and bow, whereas the Ilmatar had a smaller, side-loadable car deck. The Finlandias large size meant she could replace all three steamers operated by Finland SS Co on the service to West Germany. The Finlandia was launched on 25 August 1966 and named on the same date by Mrs. Louise Ehrnrooth, wife of Finnish banker G√∂ran Ehrnrooth. She was completed on 10 May 1967, and delivered to Finland Steamship Company on the same date on a cruise outside the Harmaja lighthouse in Helsinki. Finnish president Urho Kekkonen and his wife were invited guests on board the delivery cruise, which was made in heavy fog.  Rebuildings  The ship that started her career as the Finlandia has been rebuilt many times. The first notable refitting took place in February‚ÄìMarch 1974, when the Finlandia was fitted with retractable fin stabilisers. Between 5 September 1978 and 3 January 1979 the Finlandia was heavily rebuilt at the W√§rtsil√§ Turku shipyard. To facilitate dual use as a ferry on the Baltic during the summer high season and cruising during the remainder of the year, her interiors and accommodations were upgraded to cruise ship standards, with new cabins were installed on the upper level of the car deck, while the lower level of the car deck was retained so that she could continue transporting passenger cars. At the same time the bow gate was sealed, so that cars could only be loaded and unloaded from the stern. Following the reconstruction she could accommodate 576 all-berth passengers. Externally the midship dummy funnel was removed and the exhaust pipes in the rear redesigned. Coinciding with the reconstruction she was renamed Finnstar.Karonen, pp. 106-109. Following sale to Loke Shipping, the ship was radically rebuilt into a full-time cruise ship at Aalborg Vaerft in √Ölborg, Denmark between August 1981 and April 1982. The lower car deck was built in with cabins, and new penthouse suites were added on the top deck. The existing cabins were enlarged, so that the ship could accommodate just 515 passengers. With the elimination of the car deck the stern doors were sealed, a bulbous bow replaced the original icebreaker bow, and sponsons were fitted aft to increase stability. Following this reconstruction the ship was renamed Pearl of Scandinavia. Between 5 January and 14 February 1988 the ship was again rebuilt, this time at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore. During the refit a new sharply raked bow was fitted, increasing the ship's length by and the exhaust pipes replaced by a new aluminium funnel. After this rebuilding the ship was renamed Ocean Pearl by HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand. Service history 1967‚Äì1975: Finland Steamship Company The new Finlandia entered service on Finland Steamship Company's service connecting Helsinki, Finland to Travem√ºnde, West Germany via Copenhagen, Denmark on 25 May 1967. She was the largest car/passenger ferry in the world at the time and the fastest ferry on the Baltic Sea, capable crossing the Baltic in just 44 hours. Her facilities were notably superior to the old Finland SS Co ships she had replaced, and she gained immediate popularity. On 23 January 1968 the Finlandia collided with the West German freighter Brook in the Kustaanmiekka strait outside Helsinki. Finlandia survived the encounter without notable damage. On 27 June of the same year the Finlandia evacuated two Danish citizens from a burning motor boat outside Stevns, Denmark. In December 1968 she also became the first ship to be docked at Valmet's new 12,000 ton drydock at Katajanokka, Helsinki. Faced with competition in the form of the Finlandia, it became clear Finnlines could not operate both their Finnhansa and Finnpartner in the service to West Germany. As a result, the Finnpartner was sold to Rederi AB Svea in 1969. Following the sale Finnlines and Finland SS Co entered a joint service agreement in February 1969. Although the joint service was marketed as It√§meren-laivat (), both ships used on the service maintained the separate liveries of their respectable operators. Plans were also made for a joint subsidiary of Finland SS Co and Finnlines to operate the service to West Germany, but these were never realised. The Finlandia enjoyed an eventful career with Finland Steamship Company until 1975. On 24 March 1970 a passenger fell ill on board and had to be carried to a hospital in Visby, Gotland by a helicopter. On 31 May 1970 she suffered an engine room fire while in the Bay of Finland. The fire was put out by the crew, but the ship was delayed by three hours. In February 1971 she had to ber docked at the Eriksbergs varv in Gothenburg, Sweden due to a metal worker's strike in Finland. On 3 April 1972 the a tanker truck capsized on the car deck during a heavy storm outside the Hiiumaa lighthouse, crushing four cars. In 1975, faced with an economical downturn and increased fuel prices, Finland Steamship Company and Finnlines decided to reorganise their operations and extend their joint operations to cargo shipping. The primary result of this was the formation of Finncarriers as a joint cargo-carrying subsidiary. However, as a part of the agreement Finnlines took over the entire Finland-West Germany traffic and with it the Finlandia. An important factor in Finland SS Co withdrawing from the passenger service to West Germany was also , a new ship due to enter service for Finnlines in 1977 that would have a high enough capacity to replace all existing passenger-carrying ships on the Finland‚ÄîWest Germany service.Haavikko, pp. 119-120. 1975‚Äì1981: Finnlines Enso-Gutzeit, the owner of Finnlines, took over the Finlandia from Finland Steamship Company on 16 June 1975, ceding Finncarrier to Finland SS Co in exchange. Apart from being painted in Finnlines' livery, the Finlandia continued without changes‚Äîshe retained her old name, her old homeport and her old route, with a call at Copenhagen in addition to Helsinki and Travem√ºnde (Finnlines' Finnhansa in comparison called at Nyn√§shamn, Sweden instead of Copenhagen). While in the port of Travem√ºnde on 1 July 1975 a fire broke out in the Finlandias galley. Before the fire could be controlled, it spread to the radio cabin and officer's mess. The galley, radio cabin and mess were all destroyed by the fire, and the ship had to be repaired at Kiel, Germany before she could proceed with normal service. On 13 September 1975 the Finlandia rescued seven people from the sinking German yacht Jan II south of Gedser, Denmark. Two weeks later the Finlandia rescued two East German refugees sailing in an inflatable boat, again south of Gedser. The new Finnjet was delivered to Enso- Gutzeit in May 1977, replacing the Finlandia in the Finland-Germany service. As a result, the Finlandia was chartered to TT-Saga Line between May and August 1977 for service on the Helsingborg‚ÄîMalm√∂‚ÄîTravem√ºnde route. In November 1977 the Finlandia returned to service with Finnlines as a freighter on the Helsinki‚ÄîCopenhagen‚ÄîL√ºbeck service for duration of eight weeks. After this she remained laid up until the summer season of 1978, when she returned to service on the Finland‚ÄîGermany run. Finnlines projected that they would need to retain the Finlandia as a second ship on the Finland‚ÄîGermany run during the high season, but needed an alternate use for her during the rest of the year. The company had operated Finnpartner and Bore Star as cruise ships with limited success during the winters between 1973 and 1977. Now the decision was made to convert the Finlandias interiors into cruise ship standards, while partially retaining her car deck. Following rebuilding at W√§rtsil√§'s Turku shipyard the ship was renamed Finnstar and re-entered service on 8 January 1979 with a cruise on the west coast of Africa. During the winter season she made cruises on the African coast for Finnlines, during the spring and autumn she cruised on the Mediterranean and Norwegian fjords under charter to Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, and during the summer she was used by Finnlines as a ferry on the Helsinki‚ÄîSlite‚ÄîCopenhagen run, as well as on cruises from Helsinki to Leningrad, Slite and Tallinn. On 19 November 1979 she became the first Finnish-flagged cruise ship to cross the Equator. Like Finnlines' previous attempts to enter the cruise business, the Finnstar proved to be largely unsuccessful. She was relatively small vessel, unable to cater to the expectations of the international market. Her operational costs were also notably higher than those of her main competitors. Her West African cruises were too high-class to be sold at a reasonable price on the small Finnish cruise market. An additional factor was the competition from Finnstars former fleetmate Ilmatar that was used on similar cruises aimed at the Finnish market by Silja Line. The Finnstars prospect were further worsened in 1980, when crewing costs increased following the Finnish Maritime Strike of 1980. As a result of the increasing losses generated by the ship, Finnlines decided to give up their cruise traffic in 1980. The Finnstars last cruise terminated in Barcelona on 12 September 1980. Subsequently, she sailed to Toulon, France where she was laid up on 14 September 1980 and placed for sale. 1981‚Äì1994: Pearl Cruises The Finnstar remained laid up at Toulon until 27 May 1981, when she was sold to Loke Shipping, a joint venture between the Norway-based I.M. Skaugen and J. Lauritzen A/S shipping companies, who planned to use the ship for cruising out of Hong Kong and Singapore. Temporarily renamed Innstar, the ship sailed for Toulon to √Ölborg where she was rebuilt into a cruise ship by Aalborg Vaerft. The ship was delivered following the reconstruction in April 1982, renamed Pearl of Scandinavia and reregistered in the Bahamas. She sailed to Hong Kong, embarking on 14-, 28- and 42-day cruises in East and Southeast Asia for Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia in June 1982. On 1 September 1983 I.M. Skaugen withdrew from the Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia venture, leaving J. Lauritzen as the sole owner of the Pearl of Scandinavia. This change of ownership had no effect on her service. In April 1987 Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia were sold to 2000 Corporation. Despite the fact the 2000 Corporation already owned another cruise line, Ocean Cruise Lines, the Pearl Cruises of Scandinavia brand was retained for the Pearl of Scandinavia, although the company name was simplified to simply Pearl Cruises. Between January and February 1988 the Pearl of Scandinavia was again rebuilt, this time at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore. On 14 February she was renamed Ocean Pearl by HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand and subsequently re- entered service. Throughout these changes Loki Shipping remained the ship's owners. In April 1990 Ocean Cruise Lines were acquired by the France-based Croisi√®res Paquet. Two months later Loki Shipping sold the Ocean Pearl to Sendumar. Despite these changes the ship continued in Asian cruise service for Pearl Cruises. In 1992 Croisi√®res Paquet also acquired the Ocean Pearl. 1994‚Äì1995: Croisi√®res Paquet In February 1994 the Ocean Pearls marketing was taken over by Croisi√®res Paquet. She was renamed Pearl and reregistered in France, but continued cruising in the Asian market until 14 September 1995. 1995‚Äì1998: Costa Cruises Costa Playa at sea. The Italy-based Costa Cruises had absorbed Croisi√®res Paquet in 1994. As a result of this the Pearl was withdrawn from Croisi√®res Paquet service on 14 September 1995. She then sailed to the T. Mariotti shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Following the refit the entered service with Costa Cruises as Costa Playa on 12 November 1995. At the same time she returned under the Bahamian flag. The Costa Playa was used for cruises in the Caribbean with Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, as the port of departure. She was the first cruise ship to visit Cuba since the end of the Cold War, calling at Santiago de Cuba, Havana and Baia Nipe during her cruises. 1998‚Äì2000: Mega Wave International and Costa Cruises The Costa Playa was withdrawn from service with Costa Cruises in January 1998. She was sold to the Hong Kong-based Mega Wave International and renamed Oriental Pearl. Whether she was ever used in active service by Mega Wave is unknown. In August 1999 her ownership again passed to Costa Cruises and she was renamed Joy Wave. Again it is unknown is she was actually used in active service as the Joy Wave. 2000-2009: Eurasia International In November 2000 the Joy Wave was sold to Eurasia International, another Hong Kong-based company, who refitted her as the casino cruise ship Golden Princess. The Golden Princess entered service on casino cruises out of Hong Kong in November 2000. In July 2009, her owners sold her to China for scrapping. Design Exterior design Externally the Finlandia was designed with a classical hull-shape, with a notable sheer on the hull, a long bow, and a terraced rear superstructure. In keeping with traditional liner aesthetic, the ship was given a large midship dummy funnel. In reality the exhausts from the engines were emitted from two smaller exhaust pipes attached to the rear mast of the ship. In Finland Steamship Company service the ship was painted with a white hull and superstructure, with two narrow black stripes painted along the length of the hull on the level of the top of the car deck. In the bow the stripes were interrupted by the ship's name, painted on dark yellow. The dummy funnel was painted in the Finland SS Co colours, black with two white horizontal stripes. When the Finlandia passed under Finnlines ownership, she was painted in the then-current Finnlines colours, with the two black decorative stripes on the hull replaced by a wider blue stripe. The hull was painted grey below the blue stripe and white above. The black Effoa funnel colours were replaced by Finnlines' passenger services funnel colours, white with a white/blue stripe and a large white emblem with a black \\"F\\" in the center. When the Finlandia was converted into the Finnstar, the dummy funnel was removed and the exhaust pipes heightened and remodelled, with a small smoke deflector structure added behind them. A new colour scheme was adopted, with a white hull and superstructure. The ship's name was painted on the hull with grey letters, in a style that appeared handwritten. Wide blue stripes were painted running along the windows of the bridge deck and the lowest superstructure deck. The exhaust pipes were repainted blue and the deflector structure white with a small \\"F\\" on it. The Finnstar was the first ship to utilise a livery with blue stripes painted along the windows; two years later it was adopted by Silja Line and subsequently became strongly associated with them. As the Pearl of Scandinavia a box-like penthouse suite structure was added on the top deck, between the bridge and the exhaust pipes, while sponsons were added to the rear hull. As a new livery the ship was painted all-white, with blue exhaust pipe/deflector structure. Pearl Cruises' \\"waves and crown\\" logo was painted on the hull. During a part of her service as Pearl of Scandinavia the ship had an additional blue horizontal decorative stripe painted in the middle of the hull. When Pearl of Scandinavia became Ocean Pearl, her bow was replaced with a more sharply raked one, and the exhaust pipe structure with a sweeping funnel. As a new livery she was painted all- white, with the Pearl Cruises logo on blue in the white funnel. As Pearl she retained the same external shape, but with the blue/red Croisi√®res Paquet logo replacing the Pearl Cruises logo on the funnel, and a narrow blue/red decorative stripe on the hull following the same line as the original black decorative stripes. As Costa Playa she was repainted in the Costa Cruises livery with an all-white hull and superstructure topped with a yellow funnel with a blue \\"C\\" on it. The liveries the ship carried as Oriental Pearl and Joy Wave are unknown. As Golden Princess the sweeping windbreakers shielding the rear decks, tying to the curve of the funnel were removed. The ship was again painted all-white, with the top half of the funnel yellow and the bottom half blue, and a blue circle with the ship's name on it in the center of the funnel. Interior design The Finlandias original interiors were designed by famous artists and architects such as Jonas Cedercreutz, Lisa Johansson- Pape, Dora Jung, Harry Kivij√§rvi and Rut Bryk. The interior facilities included a swimming pool, sauna, nightclub, smoking room, cinema and hair salon, most of which were novelties for Finland Steamship Company ship on the Finland‚ÄîWest Germany run. The 647 passengers berths were divided between 254 first class berths and 393 tourist class berths. On conversion into the Finnstar the public spaces were rebuilt, the existing cabins replaced with more luxurious ones and new luxury cabins added on the upper level of the car deck. As a result, the Finnstar carried 576 all-berth passengers. As the Pearl of Scandinavia the cabins were again upgraded, the remaining car deck eliminated and new penthouse suites added; as a result the ship had berths for 515 passengers.

In 997 AD many Old Prussians were baptized by Adalbert of Prague in the Vistula Delta. By that time Slavs had moved up north and the territory became known as Pomerania by 1046 AD. The second major transition of most of the Pomeranian tribes was from Slavic to German in the 14th century. At the end of the first millennium, Piast Poland incorporated whole of Pomerania into its state. Afterwards, in the beginning of the second millennium, Denmark and the German Holy Roman Empire started to incorporate pagan Pomeranian territories into their expanding feudal states. Most Slavic Pomeranian tribes west of the Oder had lost their independence in late 12th century. In the course of the 14th and 15th century, German settlement in the Duchy of Pomerania increased. Where Slavic population was left, they were called Wends, Kashubians or Slovincians to distinguish them from the German Pomeranians. Whereas through later history the Kashubs were only minority in the Eastern Duchy of Pomerania, their numbers were notably higher in Pomerelia as well as the numbers of Germans were significantly lower there either. Pomerenian history was, from that time, closely tied to the history of Germany, Denmark and Sweden, whereas Pomerelian history was also until 1308 and between 1466 and 1772 closely tied to Poland. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Thirty Years' War and the Nordic Wars had a severe impact on all of Germany including the Pomeranian population. More than half died and many villages were wiped out. After this enormous population drop, new settlers were called in from less devastated German territories. Yet, not all villages were repopulated, so today's density of communities is not as high as back in the Middle Ages. The third major change of Pomeranian population happened in the course of World War II and its aftermath. In Nazi Germany, Jews and many members of the Polish minority were murdered. Due to the advance of the Red Army and the territorial changes after the war, nearly all Germans populating post-war Poland that survived the war and failed to evacuate in 1945 were expelled to post-war Germany 1945-1947. The major, now Polish part of Pomerania was resettled mostly with Poles, in part expellees from the former eastern territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

During the single-party rule of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT), Tchibambelela was a member of the PCT; he was considered a prot√©g√© of Pierre Moussa, the Minister of Planning and Finance, and he was elected to the PCT Central Committee at the PCT's Fourth Ordinary Congress, held on 26-31 July 1989.Yearbook on International Communist Affairs (1990), page 12. (Yearbook on International Communist Affairs series) Tchibambelela was Economic Adviser to President Denis Sassou Nguesso from 1989 to 1991. The PCT regime was forced to introduce multiparty politics in 1990,John F. Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, pages 67-68. and Tchibambelela joined the MCDDI, a new party led by Bernard Kol√©las, in 1991. The MCDDI drew its main support from members of the Lari ethnic group, like Tchibambelela, as well as the Bakongo, and it was the dominant party in the Pool Region.Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", pages 70-73. In the June-July 1992 parliamentary election, Tchibambelela was elected to the National Assembly as the MCDDI candidate in the second constituency of dolisie, located in the Pool Region. After the election, the MCDDI and six other parties formed the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD), an opposition coalition, on 27 August 1992.Joachim Emmanuel Goma-Thethet, \\"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed. Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo, Zed Books, page 111. The PCT--which had briefly formed an alliance with Pascal Lissouba and his Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS)--then defected to the opposition, and together the URD-PCT alliance held a parliamentary majority. With its parliamentary majority, the URD-PCT alliance was able to elect the candidates of its choice to the top posts in the National Assembly. In the vote, held on 24 September 1992, the PCT's Andr√© Mou√©l√© was elected as President of the National Assembly, while Tchibambelela was elected as its First Vice-President.Gaston- Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: Les d√©buts d'une crise attendue, 1992-1993 (2000), L'Harmattan, page 193 . Tchibambelela held that position for only two months, however; President Lissouba was unwilling to cooperate with an opposition-controlled National Assembly and dissolved it on 17 November 1992.\\"Dec 1992 - New government\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 38, December 1992, Congo, page 39,227.Africa Research Bulletin: Political Series, volumes 28-29 (1992), page 10,780. President Lissouba's dissolution of the National Assembly necessitated a new parliamentary election, which was held in May-June 1993. Tchibambelela was re- elected to his seat from Goma Ts√©-Ts√©, but the URD-PCT alliance was narrowly defeated by the pro-Lissouba coalition. The opposition furiously contested the official results of the 1993 election, and serious political violence followed. Amidst the violence, Tchibambelela was Vice-President of the ad hoc Parliamentary Commission for Peace.Goma-Thethet, \\"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991-97\\", page 116. An agreement signed on 30 January 1994 facilitated a gradual return to peace.Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", pages 74-75. Tchibambelela remained a Deputy in the National Assembly until October 1997, when rebel forces supporting Denis Sassou Nguesso captured Brazzaville and ousted Lissouba at the end of the 1997 civil war.

Background In 2005, Chinese media began to report that Daniel Wu had formed a boyband, Alive, with Terence Yin, Andrew Lin, and Conroy Chan. Wu and his band mates posted information, updates, personal thoughts (including slamming Hong Kong Disneyland, for which they were spokespersons), and the band's music, at their official website. In 2006, Wu made his writing and directorial debut with The Heavenly Kings, which chronicles Alive's formation and exploits. After the film's release, however, it was revealed that The Heavenly Kings was actually a mockumentary of the Hong Kong pop music industry, and Alive was constructed purely as a vehicle to make the movie; the film's characters represented only 10-15% of their real-life counterparts and much of the footage blurred the line between fiction and reality.

He worked in Stavanger Aftenblad from 1929 to 1945, except for the World War II years during parts of which he was imprisoned, and then in Verdens Gang from 1945. He edited the latter newspaper from 1967 to 1977, and chaired both the Norwegian Union of Journalists and the Norwegian Press Association. Like his father Klaus Sletten he was also a Nynorsk supporter. Early and personal life Sletten was born in Kristiania as a son of newspaper editor Klaus Daae Sletten (1877‚Äì1946) and Margit Bruun (1875‚Äì1958). He was a nephew of Jakob Hveding Sletten and a maternal grandson of Christopher Bruun. From Kristiania his family soon moved to Stavanger via Trondhjem and √Ölesund. He finished his secondary education in Stavanger in 1925, and studied at the University of Oslo, the University of Paris and the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales between 1925 and 1928. He was hired as a journalist in Stavanger Aftenblad in 1929. In 1933 he married Synn√∏ve Erika Gudmundson (1909‚Äì2001). World War II In 1940, Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany as a part of World War II. Nazification attempts of the press soon began, and when a member of the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling was installed in Stavanger Aftenblad in 1941, Sletten quit his job. He then worked part-time as a teacher, as well as in the illegal press. He was arrested in Stavanger in June 1944, and spent time in Grini concentration camp from June 1944 to February 1945. He was then detained in Berg concentration camp until the liberation of Norway, which incidentally took place on his birthday. Post-war career After the war, Sletten returned to his old job in Stavanger Aftenblad, but quit after a few months, following a dispute over the appointment of Christian S. Oftedal as editor-in- chief. Instead, he was hired by the newly established Verdens Gang in the autumn of 1945. He worked there parallel to editing the weekly newspaper Norsk Tidend, from 1946 to 1975, and chairing the trade union Norwegian Union of Journalists from 1946 to 1949 and 1952 to 1956. He helped co-found this trade union. In the Norwegian Press Association he was deputy chair from 1947 to 1951 and chair from 1962 to 1971. From 1962 to 1964 he was a board member of the International Federation of Journalists. Sletten became chief editor of Verdens Gang in 1967, and sat until his old age retirement in 1977. The newspaper had multiple chief editors at this time. Sletten replaced founding editor Christian A. R. Christensen, and co-edited with Oskar Hasselknippe, who had held the position since 1953. Between 1969 and 1974 Arne Bonde sat as a third editor. Hasselknippe and Sletten were succeeded by Tim Greve and Andreas Norland. During Sletten's period as editor Verdens Gang developed into one of Norway's leading newspapers, more or less trebling its circulation. In 1981 it surpassed Aftenposten to become Norway's largest newspaper. Sletten also chaired the Nynorsk organization Noregs Ungdomslag from 1947 to 1955, following in the footsteps of his father. He was also a member of the Norwegian Language Council and of the board of the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. As a pensioner he wrote Pressest√∏tte og pressefridom ('Press Support and Freedom of the Press', 1979), a book about the Norwegian press support. He also biographed Christopher Bruun in 1986; in 1964 he had issued a collection of Bruun's letters. He was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and of the Order of the Lion of Finland. He died in December 1984 in Oslo.

It was an inactive Atlantic hurricane season, during which only five tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1982 and ended November 30, 1982. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form. this year, however, most tropical activity was constrained to the month of September. This season produced eight tropical depressions, of which five became named storms; two attained hurricane status, of which one became a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Hurricane Alberto, the season's first named storm, was one of four storms on record to attain hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico that not make landfall. The other three were Laurie of 1969, Henri of 1979, and Jeanne of 1980. None the less, rains from Alberto caused severe flooding, which killed 23 people in Cuba. The season's only major hurricane, Debby, reached peak intensity as a weak Category 4 over the open waters of the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Ernesto, the last storm of the season, peaked in intensity on October 2 just below hurricane strength. It then dissipated the next day, 58 days before the official end of the season. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

She sometimes used the name Jane Warton.New York Times, 24 January 1910, Monday, \\"JANE WARTON\\" RELEASED.; Home Office Acts on Learning She Is Lady Constance Lytton. Although born and raised in the privileged ruling class of British society, Lytton rejected this background to join the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the most militant group of suffragette activists campaigning for \\"Votes for Women\\".BBC History, Profile of Lady Constance LyttonKnebworth House, Lytton Family archives and History ‚Äì Lady Constance Lytton and the Suffragettes Knebworth House ‚Äì Lady Constance Lytton Timeline, The Principal Events of Lady Constance's Life She was subsequently imprisoned four times, including once in Walton gaol in Liverpool under the nom de guerre of Jane Warton, where she was force fed while on hunger strike. She chose the alias and disguise of Jane Warton, an 'ugly London seamstress', to avoid receiving special treatment and privileges because of her family connections: she was the daughter of a viceroy and the sister of a member of the House of Lords. She wrote pamphlets on women's rights, articles in The Times newspaper, and a book on her experiences, Prisons and Prisoners, which was published in 1914.Constance Lytton and Jane Warton, Spinster, Prisons and Prisoners, Some personal Experiences, in A Celebration of Women Writers (London: William Heinemann, 1914) While imprisoned in Holloway during March 1909, Lytton used a piece of broken enamel from a hairpin to carve the letter \\"V\\" into the flesh of her breast, placed exactly over the heart. \\"V\\" for Votes for Women.Lytton (1914), chapter 8 Lytton remained unmarried, because her mother refused her permission to marry a man from a \\"lower social order\\", while she refused to contemplate marrying anyone else. Her heart attack, stroke, and early death at the age of 54 have been attributed in part to the trauma of her hunger strike and force feeding by the prison authorities. Early life and family Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton Edith Villiers Lytton was the third of seven children of Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton and Edith Villiers. She spent some of her early years in India, where her father was the Governor- General; it was he who made the proclamation that Queen Victoria was the Empress of India.Votes for Women By June Purvis, Sandra Stanley Holton Her siblings were: *Edward Rowland John Bulwer-Lytton (1865‚Äì1871) *Lady Elizabeth Edith \\"Betty\\" Bulwer-Lytton (12 June 1867 ‚Äì 28 March 1942).

Married the architect Edwin Lutyens. Associate and confidante of Jiddu Krishnamurti. *Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton (1876‚Äì1947), married Pamela Chichele-Plowden, an early flame of Sir Winston Churchill, who had met her while playing polo at Secunderabad.The Guardian, Sunday 9 November 2003, by David Smith. Letters reveal heartbreak of young Winston *Neville Bulwer-Lytton, 3rd Earl of Lytton (6 February 1879 ‚Äì 9 February 1951) In the early years in India, Lytton was educated by a series of governesses and reportedly had a lonely childhood. She apparently met Winston Churchill while living in India, where he was a rival to her brother Victor for the hand of Pamela Chichele-Plowden. She is reported to have said: \\"The first time you see Winston Churchill you see all his faults, and the rest of your life you spend discovering his virtues.Lady Lytton, in Christopher Hassall, Edward Marsh. Although she matured in England surrounded by many of the great artistic, political and literary names of the day, she rejected the aristocratic way of life. After her father died, she retired from view to care for her mother, rejecting attempts to interest her in the outside world. Lytton remained unmarried until her death; in 1892 her mother refused her permission to marry a man from a \\"lower social order\\". For several years she waited in vain for her mother to change her mind, while refusing to contemplate marrying anyone else. In 1897 her aunt, Theresa Earle, published her gardening guide Pot-Pourri from a Surrey Garden. She had been encouraged to write this by Lytton who typed some of the text. The book sold quickly and well and in one of the later editions Lytton added a section on Japanese flower arranging. Women's suffrage The reclusive phase of Lytton's life started to change in 1905 when she was left ¬£1,000 in her great- aunt/godmother, Lady Bloomfield's estate.New York Times, 23 May 1905, Tuesday, Lady Bloomfield Dies, A Friend of Queen Victoria and a Well-Known Author. She donated this to the revival of Morris dancing and her family records state that \\"Her brother Neville suggested that she gave it to the Esperance Club, a small singing and dancing group for working class girls\\", where part of their remit was teaching Morris dancing. The Esperance club was founded by Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Mary Neal in response to distressing conditions for girls in the London dress trade. (1908) Conversion to suffragette cause Between September 1908 and October 1909 Constance Lytton's conversion to the militant suffragette cause was complete. On 10 September 1908 she wrote to Adela Smith: Suffragette handbill She subsequently met other suffragettes, including Annie Kenney and Pethick-Lawrence, at the Green Lady Hostel and on a tour of Holloway prison. On 14 October 1908, she wrote to her mother: In Prison and Prisoners, she stated: \\"Women had tried repeatedly, and always in vain, every peaceable means open to them of influencing successive governments. Processions and petitions were absolutely useless. In January 1909 I decided to become a member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).\\" Working for the WSPU she made speeches throughout the country, and used her family connections to campaign in Parliament. She wrote to the Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone asking for Emmeline Pankhurst and Christabel Pankhurst to be released from prison. (1909) Imprisonment and self- mutilation in Holloway Manuscript of Prisons and Prisoners, annotated by Constance Lytton: \\"I am aiming at a book of about 300 pages, to cost 2/6d. Sylvia's description of prison gates opening to a prisoner on outer cover. Portrait of me as Con. Another as Jane Warton on frontispiece.\\" Lytton was imprisoned in Holloway prison twice during 1909, after demonstrating at the House of Commons, but her ill health (a weak heart) meant that she spent most of her sentence in the infirmary. When the authorities discovered her identity, the daughter of Lord Lytton, they ordered her release. The British government were also aware that her health problems and hunger striking could lead to martyrdom. Infuriated by such inequality of justice she wrote to the Liverpool Daily Post in October 1909 to complain about the favourable treatment she had received. On 24 February 1909, Lytton wrote to her mother about prison and reform in Prisons and Prisoners (Chapter III-\\"A Deputation to the Prime Minister\\"): While she was imprisoned in Holloway Prison during March 1909 she started to mutilate her body. Her plan was to carve 'Votes for Women' from her breast to her cheek, so that it would always be visible. But after completing the \\"V\\" on her breast and ribs she requested sterile dressings to avoid blood poisoning, and her plan was aborted by the authorities. Lytton wrote of the self-mutilation action in Prisons and Prisoners (Chapter VIII-\\"A Track to the Water's Edge\\"): (1909) Imprisonment in Newcastle In October 1909 Constance Lytton was arrested for a second time in Newcastle.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/battle-newcastle-how- women-took-14404964 She had thrown a stone wrapped in paper bearing the message 'To Lloyd George ‚Äì Rebellion against tyranny is obedience to God ‚Äì Deeds, not words'. Her message was in response to the government's new policy of force-feeding imprisoned suffragettes who were on hunger strike.E. Chambr√© Hardman Archive (PortCities Liverpool) National Trust, Lady Constance Lytton and the Campaign for Women's Suffrage on Merseyside, Force feeding suffragettes in prison (1910) Jane Warton in Liverpool, Walton gaol Lytton posing as Jane Warton, a London seamstress, at a protest in Liverpool (1910) In January 1910, convinced that poorer prisoners were treated badly, Lytton travelled to Liverpool disguised as a working-class London seamstress named Jane Warton. In disguise whe spoke at an event with Jennie Baines and Patricia Woodlock and led a procession to the Prison Governor's house demanding the 'stain' of force-feeding be removed from Liverpool. She was arrested after an incident of rocks being thrown at an MP's car, imprisoned in Walton gaol for 14 days 'hard labour' and force-fed 8 times. After her release, although desperately weak, she wrote accounts of her experience for The Times and Votes for Women (the monthly journal of the WSPU, launched in 1907). She went on to lecture on the subject of her experience of the conditions which suffragette prisoners endured. It's thought that her speeches and letters helped to end the practice of force-feeding. Lytton wrote of the Jane Warton episode in Prisons and Prisoners, (Chapter XII-Jane Warton) and (Chapter XIII-Walton Gaol, Liverpool: My Third Imprisonment). Walton Gaol, Liverpool (1910) She was invited to Eagle House in Batheaston in 1910 where the leading suffragettes planted trees to commemorate their work. Here pictured with Annie Kenney =Force-feeding= Lytton's health continued to deteriorate and she suffered a heart attack in August 1910, and a series of strokes which paralysed the right side of her body. Undaunted, she used her left hand to write Prisons and Prisoners (1914), which became influential in prison reform. Lytton had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. 1911 onwards In June 1911, Lytton's brother had a letter from Ellen Avery, the local school headmistress, and forty one other \\"Suffrage women of Knebworth and Woolmer Green\\" thanking the Lyttons for having \\"laboured for our Cause\\" and \\"for faith in us as Women\\": 17 were WSPU signatories, including Constance's own cook Ethel Smith, and Dora Spong, whose family made domestic equipment like mincers, which the cook may have used, and 9 were in the non-militant suffragist NUWSS. In November 1911 Constance Lytton was imprisoned in Holloway for the fourth time, after breaking windows in the Houses of Parliament, or of a Post Office in Victoria Street, London. However, conditions had improved, \\"all was civility; it was unrecognisable from the first time I had been there\\" and suffragettes were treated as political prisoners. After the WSPU ended its militant campaign at the outbreak of war in 1914, Lytton gave her support to Marie Stopes' campaign to establish birth control clinics. In January 1918 parliament passed a bill giving women over 30 the vote if they were married to a property owner or were one themselves. Death and commemoration Constance Lytton never fully recovered from her prison treatment, heart attack and strokes, and was nursed at Knebworth by her mother. They lived at Homewood, a house designed by Constance's brother-in- law, Edwin Lutyens. She died in 1923, aged 54, only days after moving out of Homewood to a flat in Paddington, London, in an attempt to restart an active life.Jenkins (2015), pp. 228‚Äì30.

As time went by, and as the series proved to be highly successful, more new titles were added to expand its scope. At the same time, a handful of titles also disappeared from the comprehensive \\"checklists\\" (located on back covers) when these volumes were revised and republished under a different title and/or series number. Specifically, there were six titles that were removed from checklists when they were reissued with a later series number. They were: # 5006 Stars (reissued as 5064 Stars) # 5019 Flight (reissued as 5065 Airplanes and the Story of Flight) # 5038 Fish (reissued as 5066 Fish) # 5044 Ships (reissued as 5067 Boats and Ships) # 5048 The Moon (reissued as 5068 The Moon) # 5052 Railroads (reissued as 5069 Trains and Railroads) Although some of the titles were not altered from earlier versions, both the cover artwork and the interior content were changed. Thus, it is easy to distinguish between the early versions and the latter issues by the cover art alone. The first 69 books in the series were issued with beautifully illustrated cover art, otherwise referred to as Painted Covers, during the 1960s. Later reprints in the 1970s, however, switched to Photo Covers. In fact, four of the last five volumes in the series were only produced in a photo cover version (Ecology, Extinct Animals, Snakes, and Fossils). Strangely enough, one of the final five titles (The Environment and You) was only issued in a painted cover, even though it was not released until the 1970s. Because of the striking cover artwork, and thanks largely to the nostalgic appeal of these books, they have become collectable items once more today. The mystery of the missing series numbers  A mystery for collectors is the absence of How and Why Wonder Book volumes numbered 5074 or 5075. While it may well have been the original intent of publishers to fill in these missing gaps in the series sequence, this was never done. With the advent of the ISBN numbering system, the 5075 number was eventually assigned to a 1985 hardcover reprint of Earl Schenck Miers book America and Its Presidents (). The ISBN number associated with number 5074 () has never been assigned. Price Stern Sloan How and Why Editions Price Stern Sloan took over the publication of the How and Why series and released many of the existing titles with new covers. In addition they added some new titles to the list: # Space # Solar System # Living Things # Planet Earth # Motorcycles # Automobiles # Ships and Submarines # Robots # Radiation # Aircraft The first four of these had the series name How and Why Wonder Books above the title; the remainder reverted to the original The How and Why Wonder Book of... formulation. How and Why Activity Books Price Stern Sloan also released a matching series of activity books that contained mazes, puzzles and games about the subject they contained. Titles released in this series were: # Beginning Science # Cats # Dinosaurs # The Earth # Four Famous Dinosaurs # Human Body # Insects # Prehistoric Animals # Reptiles # Rocks and Minerals # Sharks # Space # Wild Animals # Wild Animals of North America The UK Series During the 1960s and 1970s, the How and Why Wonder Book series was concurrently published in the United Kingdom by Transworld Publishers of London. For the most part, both the cover artwork and the inner content of the UK volumes were identical to those of the U.S. publications. However, a handful of the UK versions contained either revised text and/or unique cover art. Many of these revisions were done to reflect European species (Birds, Insects) or to emphasize regional conditions. The UK series was published using a completely different numbering sequence from the U.S. series (Dinosaurs is number 6501,Geis, Darlene The How and Why Wonder Book of Dinosaurs. Transworld Publishers, London. The 6501 series number is derived from the ten-digit Stars is 6503,Hoss, Norman The How and Why Wonder Book of Stars. Transworld Publishers, London. The 6503 series number is derived from the ten-digit etc.). Also, the UK version of Extinct Animals has a painted cover as opposed to the U.S. version's photo cover. The following standard series titles were released in the UK by Transworld Publishers. Unless otherwise indicated, both the content and cover art used were identical to those of the American versions: How and Why Wonder Books *6501 Dinosaurs *6502 Weather *6503 Stars *6504 The Human Body *6505 Chemistry *6506 Horses *6507 Planets and Interplanetary Travel *6508 Wild Animals *6509 Lost Cities *6510 Dogs *6511 Fish *6512 Caves to Skyscrapers *6513 Our Earth *6514 The First World War (different cover art from US version) *6515 Explorations and Discoveries (different cover from later US softcover, but same as US hardcover and initial US softcover) *6516 Mathematics *6517 Primitive Man *6518 Science Experiments *6519 The Microscope *6520 Flight *6521 Prehistoric Mammals *6522 Atomic Energy *6523 Robots and Electronic Brains *6524 Ballet *6525 Electricity *6526 Machines *6527 Sound *6528 Ants and Bees *6529 Light and Colour *6530 Reptiles *6531 Rocks and Minerals *6532 Beginning Science *6533 Famous Scientists *6534 The Polar Regions *6535 North American Indians *6536 The Lady of the Lamp (identical to US Florence Nightingale version, but unique title) *6537 Winning of the West *6538 Time *6539 Basic Inventions *6540 Magnets and Magnetism *6541 Old Testament *6542 Oceanography *6543 Building *6544 Deserts *6548 Rocks and Minerals (Revised Edition of #6531) *6550 Electronics *6551 Air and Water *6552 Railways (new text and cover art as compared to US Railroads edition) *6553 Birds (revised text and unique cover art) *6554 Coins (new text and cover art as compared to US Coins and Currency edition) *6555 Extinct Animals (was UK release first, subsequently released in US with different cover) *6557 World War II (revised text and unique cover art) *6561 Wild Flowers (revised text and unique cover art) *6562 Trees (unique cover art) *6564 Fossils (was UK release first, subsequently released in US with different cover) *6568 Butterflies and Moths (revised text and unique cover art) *6571 Insects (revised text and unique cover art) *6572 Robots and Electronic Brains (Revised Edition of #6523) *6575 Electronics (Revised Edition of #6550) *6579 Ships (unique cover art) *6580 Dogs (Revised Edition of #6510) *6581 Beginning Science (Revised Edition of #6532) *6585 Snakes *6586 Planets and Interplanetary Travel (Revised Edition of #6507) *6592 Weather (same cover image as U.S. edition, but revised content to #6502) *6595 Deserts (Same content as US edition but unique cover as compared to #6544) In addition to the foregoing, Transworld expanded the UK series with the release of the following new, unique titles: *6545 The Tower of London *6546 Stamps *6547 Seashore *6549 Castles *6556 The Spoilt Earth *6558 Communications *6559 Dance *6560 Kings and Queens *6563 Photography *6565 Ancient Rome *6566 Common Market *6567 Volcanoes *6569 Vikings *6570 Cats *6573 Costume *6574 The Crusades *6576 The Motor Car *6577 Energy and Power Sources *6578 Radio and TV *6583 Heraldry *6587 Deep Sea *6589 Pets *6591 Arms and Armour *6596 Rare Animals *6597 Ancient Egypt *6598 Oil *6599 Parliament *6600 The Ice Age *6601 Arab World Early editions of the UK volumes had a \\"checklist\\" on their back covers, similar to American copies. This format was used up until #6536 (Lady of the Lamp); released in 1967. However, soon thereafter, the format of the back cover was revised to show a photo of a random selection of some of the volumes available in the series. In addition, Transworld published two How and Why BUMPER WONDER Books which were \\"puzzles, quizzes, jokes, amazing facts\\" using content and images from the various How and Why editions. * Bumper Wonder Book #1 (#6584) () * Bumper Wonder Book #2 (#6593) () One feature of most UK editions of the How and Why books was that the back inner cover featured an advertisement for a \\"Collector's Binder\\" to hold your How and Why books. The ad read \\"The new How and Why collector binder holds 12 titles; a wonderful way to build your own reference library! It is available from the publishers of the How and Why books for only 16/-. Supplies are limited so send for yours now.\\" This back inner cover advertisement was a standard feature for many years. It also appears that four of the ISBN series numbers contained within the sequential Transworld numbering block were never assigned to volumes within the How and Why Wonder book series; these being volumes #6582 (), #6588 (), #6590 () and #6594 (). An ISBN search of these numbers indicates that they were never assigned to published volumes. Although the above lists are comprehensive for How and Why Wonder Book volumes published by Grosset & Dunlap and Transworld in the 1960s and 1970s, certain volumes in the series continued to be published by Price Stern Sloan into the 1980s and that additional unique titles were added to the series. New How and Why Wonder Book titles included Radiation, Ships and Submarines, Planet Earth, Living Things, Automobiles, Motorcycles, Space, Robots, Aircraft, and the Solar System. None of these titles was available earlier than 1987 and thus they do not appear in the foregoing checklists. Dutch translations Dutch translations of the American originals were published, originally in softcover and later in hardcover, by Zuid-Nederlandse Uitgeverij at Deurne, Belgium under the titles \\"HOE EN WAAROM\\" or \\"Het HOE EN WAAROM boek van\\". German translations German translations were published from 1961, originally in softcover and later in hardcover, by Tessloff Verlag, Hamburg, Germany, under the title \\"Was ist was\\". The edition was fairly successful and produced audio CDs and DVDs later on. Writers, illustrators and photographers Many individuals contributed to the How and Why Wonder Book series.

Spotlight Wonder Books and the 7900 Series Closely associated with the How and Why Wonder Book series are two other series of softcover books produced by publisher Grosset and Dunlap in the 1960s under the Wonder Books banner. They are the Spotlight Wonder Book series and the otherwise nameless \\"7900\\" series. Spotlight Wonder Books The Spotlight Wonder Book series focused on famous people or institutions as opposed to science topics.

The film is based upon an 1872 opera Don C√©sar de Bazan of Adolphe d'Ennery et Philippe Dumanoir. Synopsis The film takes place in Seville, in a period where the city has sunk into the depths of depravity and sin. Shocked by the depths his people have sunk to, the king of Spain (Holbrook Blinn) decides to give the town a visit when a carnaval is organized in order to redeem it. One of its inhabitants is Rosita (Mary Pickford), a beloved street singer praised by the townspeople for her entertainment. Rosita is the only source of income to her poor family, who are always fighting each other. She is fed up with living in extreme poverty, while the king is living in wealth. After being forced to pay taxes, Rosita is enraged and comes up with a song in which she insults the king. Soon, the king is informed with the offensive ballad and visits her anonymously. Instead of being angry, he is charmed by the woman. However, the soldiers have come to arrest her for publicly insulting the king. While being taken to prison, Don Diego (George Walsh) tries to defend her. Instead of convincing the soldiers to set her free, however, he is arrested as well. They fall in love at the police station, but she is unaware Diego is a powerful captain. By the king's request, Rosita is set free and escorted to his castle. Diego, however, is told he will be hung. When she meets him, Rosita doesn't believe he is the king. He tries to seduce her, but she isn't impressed until he offers her fashionable clothes. She doesn't want to have anything to do with him, but is pressured into giving in to his advances by her family, who see an opportunity on becoming wealthy. Living a luxurious life in the castle, the family still feels disrespected. Rosita's mother (Mathilde Comont) demands for her daughter to have a noble husband, and the king offers her to be married to Diego. Rosita's mother is pleased, not knowing he will be sentenced to death shortly after the wedding. Diego is manipulated into participating by the offer of being shot like a respectable soldier, rather than hanged. At the wedding, they are married with their eyes covered, thus not knowing who they will be married to. The king's plan fails when Rosita breaks the rules and looks at her future husband. Rosita is shocked to learn her new husband is Diego, who is sent back to jail immediately. Rosita convinces the king to set Diego free. However, when she leaves, the king again orders the guards to kill Diego. Meanwhile, the queen (Irene Rich) has found out about his new fling and is furious. Soon afterward, Rosita is informed that Diego has been executed. Devastated, she attempts to kill the king until she and the king find out Diego is still alive, and the lovers are reunited. The king leaves his castle to be confronted by his wife about his affair. She reveals she ordered the guards to spare Diego.

Pickford appealed to a fan magazine for new film ideas, and the magazine's contributors wrote back that they wanted to see her play more child roles, such as Cinderella. Pickford thanked them and promptly set out to make a film with an adult role. In 1922, her studio United Artists was not making any profits despite releasing successful films such as Broken Blossoms, Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921) and Robin Hood (1922). Pickford was desperate to release a film that could perform well and free her of her image as an ingenue. Realizing Hollywood was making profits with costume movies such as When Knighthood Was in Flower, she decided to make a film based on the 1902 novel Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall. She chose Ernst Lubitsch as her director and brought him from Germany in October 1922 to meet with her.Whitfield, Eileen: Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood, pages 232-234 - Lubitsch decided he could not make Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall. Pickford was annoyed because she had paid $250,000 on its preparations (and eventually filmed the story later). They looked for another story to make a movie, ultimately choosing Faust. However, the project was dropped when Pickford's mother, Charlotte Hennessy, overheard Lubitsch discussing the baby killing scene and immediately nixed the idea. Lubitsch and Pickford eventually decided to film the opera Don C√©sar de Bazan, retitling it as Rosita. Lubitsch hesitated about making it, but Pickford convinced him to work on the project.Whitfield, Eileen: Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood, pages 234-235 - Pickford wanted Ram√≥n Novarro to co-star opposite her as Don Diego. Rex Ingram, Navarro's mentor, protested this offer by reminding Novarro that Pickford once stated that Novarro's \\"face and body do not match.\\"Ellenberger, A., Ramon Novarro: a biography of the silent film idol, 1899-1968. p.26 Novarro followed Ingram's advice and rejected the role. Lubitsch later said working with Pickford was a delight. Pickford also enjoyed working with Lubitsch, and at first contracted him to make three more movies with her.Whitfield, Eileen: Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood, page 238 - Release Upon its release, the film was met with success, earning over $1 million. Preservation For reasons unknown, Pickford decided the film was a failure. While she carefully preserved most of her filmography, she allowed Rosita to decay, save for the film's fourth reel, and no prints of the film were thought to exist. However, in the 1960s a nitrate print was discovered in the Russian film archives and repatriated by The Museum of Modern Art. A safety preservation negative was made from the nitrate print, but no further work was done on the film. Starting in 2016, work restoring the film began as recent breakthroughs in digital restoration made it possible to reclaim much of the film's severely damaged images. In 2017, the restoration of the film held its world premiere at the 74th Venice International Film Festival.

Coder grew up in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania where he was a state champion high school track star. He entered Penn State University in 1947. Bill Jeffrey spotted Coder playing an intramural soccer game during Coder‚Äôs sophomore year and recruited him into the school‚Äôs soccer team. Coder and his team mates went on to win the 1950 and 1951 college championships. Coder graduated in the spring of 1951, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and became a tanker pilot. In 1955, he joined the Armed Forces soccer team. As a result, he attended trials for the 1956 U.S. Olympic soccer team and was selected as the team‚Äôs starting goalkeeper. Prior to the tournament in Melbourne, Australia, the U.S. toured the Far East.

Le Borgne was a highly successful merchant in France and had financed d‚ÄôAulnay in his Acadian trade. When d‚ÄôAulnay died by drowning, Le Borgne laid formal claim to the estate. He then sent an expedition to Acadia the next year to attempt a monopoly of the trade and secure the money owed to him. His youngest son, Alexandre Le Borgne de Belle-Isle, acted as governor temporarily, ahead of his father's arrival to Acadia. His competition was Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour at Saint John (whose daughter, Marie, was, in 1668, wed to his son, Alexandre) and another former governor of Acadia, Nicolas Denys, at Cape Breton. In 1653, along with raiding Pentagouet (Castine, Maine), LaHave, Nova Scotia, and Nipisguit (Bathurst, New Brunswick), Emmanuel Le Borgne, with 100 men, also raided Saint-Pierre.

It is commonly known as the abruptly-bulbous agaricus or the flat-bulb mushroom. First described by the mycologist Charles Horton Peck, this bulbous-stemmed edible species smells slightly of anise, and turns yellow when bruised or cut. The mushroom is medium-sized, with a white, yellow-staining cap on a slender stipe that has a wide, flat bulb on the base Taxonomy and classification The species was originally named as Agaricus abruptus by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1900. In his 1904 Report of the State Botanist publication, he changed the name to Agaricus abruptibulbus. He explained that Elias Magnus Fries had earlier named a species in the subgenus Flammula, which he called Agaricus abruptus; the subgenus was later raised to the rank of genus, and the species was given the name Flammula abruptus. Under the transitioning nomenclatural conventions of the time, it was unclear if Agaricus abruptus would remain available for use, so he changed the name. Agaricus abruptibulbus belongs in the Arvenses clade of the genus Agaricus (along with species A. silvicola, A. arvensis, and A. semotus). Some American authors consider this species to be synonymous with A. silvicola, while some in Europe have synonymized it with the similar species A. essettei. American mycologists Steve Trudell and Joseph Ammirati noted in a 2009 field guide: \\"The name A. abruptibulbus has been applied to forms with bulbous stipe bases, but variation in stipe shape is so great that the use of this name has been largely abandoned.\\" Description The cap is up to in diameter, convex in shape, sometimes with an umbo, and whitish in color. After being scratched or bruised, the cap turns yellow. The stipe is long by thick and bulbous. A large, white annular ring is present on the stipe. The gill attachment is free, and the color is initially grayish but turns brownish after the spores are developed. Specimens smell slightly of anise. The spore print is brown to purple-brown. Spores are elliptical in shape, and are 6‚Äì8 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. The surface of the cap will stain yellow if a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied. Similar species Agaricus silvicola is very similar in appearance and also grows in woodlands, but it may be distinguished by the lack of an abruptly bulbous base. Agaricus arvensis has a more robust stature, lacks the bulbous base, and grows in grassy open areas like meadows and fields. It has larger spores than A. abruptibulbus, typically 7.0‚Äì9.2 by 4.4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm. Cadmium bioaccumulation Agaricus abruptibulbus is known to bioaccumulate the toxic element cadmium‚Äîin other words, it absorbs cadmium faster than it loses it‚Äîso specimens collected in the wild often have higher concentrations of this element than the soil in which they are found. Furthermore, when cultivated in the laboratory, the presence of cadmium in the culture medium stimulates growth up to 100% in the presence of 0.5 mg cadmium per liter of nutrient medium. It is believed that the cadmium-binding ability comes from a low molecular weight metal-binding protein named cadmium- mycophosphatin. Distribution The fungus has been reported in New York, Mississippi, Quebec, Canada, and Germany.

The village is bypassed by the A30 road.  History and antiquities  Temple derives its name from the hospice founded by Knights Templars who built a refuge for pilgrims and travellers, en route to the Holy Land, in the 12th century. On the suppression of the Templars it passed into the hands of the Knights Hospitallers (in 1314), who held it until the religious houses were suppressed by Henry VIII. In 1901 it was a curacy of Warleggan and in 1934, the parish of Temple was incorporated into Blisland parish.  Church  Temple Church is a Grade II* listed building built c.1120 on land owned by the Knights Templar. It became famous as a place where marriages could be performed without banns or licence (similar to Gretna Green until the early 20th century). This came to an end in 1744 when the church first came under episcopal jurisdiction. By the mid-19th century, it had become a ruin and a final service was held on 29 January 1882, in front of a ‚Ä≥large congregation‚Ä≥ led by the Reverend J Brown. It was rebuilt (by Silvanus Trevail) in the following year.Cornish Church Guide (1925). [Parochial history, by Charles Henderson; Temple, p. 202]. Truro: Blackford The church is dedicated to St Catherine. The church contains several references to its links with the Knights Templar, including a cross patt√©e in the east window and a depiction of a mounted knight in the north window of the church tower.  Crosses  Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded the existence of eight stone crosses in the parish, including two cross slabs, all in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses.

It was also known as Santa Brigida a Campo de' Fiori since it was built on what was then part of Campo de' Fiori but is now the urbanistically distinct Piazza Farnese. History A first building rose during the pontificate of Boniface IX (1389‚Äì1404) but was later abandoned. In 1513, Peder M√•nsson, later (1524) Bishop of V√§ster√•s in Sweden, erected a new church. It was officially granted to the Bishop of Uppsala by Pope Paul III (1534‚Äì1549). It was restored in the early 18th century by Pope Clement XI (1700‚Äì1721). In 1828, Pope Leo XII gave the convent and church to the Canons of Santa Maria in Trastevere. They did not have the means to restore it, and gave it to the Congregation of Holy Cross, a French congregation, in 1855. They restored the church and the rooms of St Bridget in 1857-1858. The next owner was a Polish branch of the Carmelite Order, to whom the convent and church was given in 1889. They held it until 1930, when it was returned to the Bridgittine Order. The paintings in the church were restored before the Bridgittine jubilee of 1991. Exterior The fa√ßade was constructed in 1705 and adorned with statues of St Brigid and her daughter St Catherine by Andrea Fucigna. Minor changes, such as the shapes of the windows, were made in the 19th century. The design of the neo-romanesque bell-tower, added in 1894, is attributed to the architect Raffaele Ingami who carried out much consolidation work for the convent at the time.Raffaella Catini, Ingami, Raffaele, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 62 (2004) Interior There are two marble holy water fonts. On the right-hand one may be seen the lily of the Farnese family, placed here when Cardinal Odoardo Farnese was the protector of the convent, 1601-1626. The one on the left side has the arms of the Carmelite Order. Another protector was Cardinal Virginio Orsini whose coat of arms can be seen on a marble bowl in the sacristy. In the early 18th century the church was embellished with six paintings Scenes from the Life of St Bridget by Biagio Puccini, executed between 1702 and 1705.Chiara Coronato, in: Un capolavoro del Settecento: i dipinti di Biagio Puccini nella chiesa parrocchiale a Casoli in Val di Lima , 2005 Circa 1709-1711, Puccini also painted the large ceiling fresco. In its centre is The Glory of St Bridget which is clearly influenced by the large marble relief of The Glory of St Catherine of Siena by Melchiorre Caf√† from the 1660s. There are three recently discovered memorial plaques in the church. They are not in their original positions. Two of them, one by the entrance to the Chapel of St Richard and one by the sacristy door, must have been in Bridget's room, and the third was probably placed on the fa√ßade until the new church was built in the 16th century. Chapel of St Richard Near the entrance are two doors. One leads to the Chapel of St Richard, the other to the new sacristy (1894). The chapel was built in 1894 on Neo-Gothic style by Raffaele Ingami. It is dedicated to an English Bridgettine monk, Richard Reynolds, who was martyred in London in 1535. He is considered the most important martyr of the order. The chapel was originally dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, and an inscription from this period has been preserved on the altar. On the walls are eight paintings of scenes from the life of the Blessed Virgin, made by Eugenio Cisterna. On the right-hand side is the cenotaph of Nils Karlsson Bielke (died 1765) by Tommaso Righi. He was a descendant of one of St Bridget's brothers. After converting to Catholicism he lived in exile in Rome, and was made a senator. His place of burial is unknown. Also on the right-hand side is the Altar of Our Lady. The painting by Virginio Monti, depicting Mary and the Holy Child in a classical landscape scene, was made in the 19th century. It is a copy of a lost original by Annibale Carracci. Opposite this altar is the Altar of St Catherine of Sweden. It was redecorated in 1894. The painting, made in that year, is by Eugenio Cisterna, a pupil of Virginio Monti. It originally depicted St Bridget and St Teresa of Avila, but when the church was given to the Bridgettine Sisters in 1930, the figure of St Teresa was altered to represent St Catherine. Chapel of St Catherine In the crypt is the Chapel of St Catherine, which was dedicated in 1972. It has 70 seats, and is used by the Church of Sweden. Lutheran services are held on Sundays and Thursdays. Convent The church is part of the convent of the Bridgettine Sisters. The convent building was owned by Francesca Papazurri, who became a close friend of St Bridget during the Holy Year of 1350. It was at that time known as the Palatium Magnum, The Grand Palace. Bridget lived there for 19 years, and her rooms have been preserved. After Bridget's death, the house was donated to the order's mother house in Vadstena, and it was used as a hospice for Swedish pilgrims and clergy visiting Rome. In the 16th century, the Reformation brought radical changes. The convent became a refuge for Swedish Catholics who chose exile rather than conversion. Among those who lived here in this period was Johannes Magnus (1488‚Äì1544), the last Catholic Archbishop of Sweden. Olaus Magnus arrived in 1549, and set up a printing press in the house. He published the revelations of St Bridget from this press in 1557. As the mother house in Vadstena was suppressed, a cardinal was made protector of the convent. During her exile from 1673 until her death in 1689, Queen Christina of Sweden was its protectress. The building was restored by Pope Clement XI (1700‚Äì1721). Since then, only minor changes have been made to the exterior. It is possible to visit the rooms of St Bridget and her daughter St Catherine, first abbess of the Bridgettine Sisters. The rooms contain relics of the two saints, and are decorated with paintings from the lives of the saints. Jewish artist √âdouard Brandon is responsible for the artworks in the room of St Bridget. Chapels of St Bridget and St Catherine have been installed in their respective rooms.

It is dedicated to St Thomas the Apostle. The church is normally open to the public only between 20 and 28 September. History The church has ancient origins, but the first documented date is 1139, when Pope Innocent II consecrated it. It seems certain that this was a reconsecration after a rebuilding or enlargement of the church. In 1449, Pope Nicholas V granted the church to the Company of Scriptors and Copyists of the Curia. St Philip Neri was ordained to the priesthood in the church in 1551. The present church is the result of a rebuilding in 1582. It was built to a design by Francesco Volterra by Mario and Camillo Cerrini. It was made a titular church in 1517. This status was kept until 1937, when Pope Pius XI suppressed its status due to the state of disrepair the church was in; the title had then been vacant since 1914. The title was transferred to Chiesa Nuova. The church is served by the Cistercian Order. As it is also the national church of Ethiopia, and Mass is celebrated according to both Latin and Alexandrine (Coptic) rite. Architecture The 16th century brick fa√ßade was designed by Jacopo del Duca. It has two stories, with the lower divided into three sections. The middle section has a doorway crowned by a triangular tympanon, and the outer sections have windows. On the upper level is a central window crowned by a rounded tympanon. The middle section is crowned by a tympanon; the outer sections consist only of volutes. Interior The nave has three aisles separated by pilasters with Ionic capitals. The nave has a visible tile roof, while the outer aisles have plaster ceilings. The high altar, set against the apse wall, has two marble columns on the sides and is crowned by a tympanon. The 17th century altarpiece depicts St Thomas. On the sides are paintings of Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo and St Philip Neri. The latter was ordained in this church. On the left wall are frescoes from the pontificate of Innocent II (1130-1143). One of them depicts St Martin of Tours Dividing his Cloak. There are also paintings from the 19th century, of which The Annunciation by Giuseppe Passeri is the most notable.

The procedure is typically conducted in a surgical setting. Cheesewiring or the cheesewire effect can also describe the process of suture material cutting or tearing through viscera at the time of suture anastomosis and tension. As a complication Cheesewiring can be a complication or part of a negative outcome of a procedure. Examples include tumor growth penetrating the openings in a bowel stent that was placed to open an obstructed bowel, sutures used to hold a transplanted cornea in place, and treatment of tendon rupture, when sutures pull through the tendon. Evidence that the cheesewire effect has occurred is most clearly seen after surgery has been completed. Postoperatively as wound margins begin to swell, a suture can drag through the thin portion of tissue present near the surface. This suture drag is most often the result of tension being reduced in tying or placing the suture. It is apparent that cheesewiring has occurred if the suture has moved a little closer to the insertion site. A tell tale ‚ÄúY‚Äù shaped scar is evidence that cheesewiring has taken place. Cheesewiring that causes drag can lead to damage to tissue and make a surgeon tug on the material, leading to suture pullout. This causes an increased procedure time for the surgeon as well as a prolonged recovery period for the patient. Cheesewire complications are most often seen in cornea surgeries due to the soft tissue present in the eye. One of the most common occurrences is cheese wiring of the puncta occurring during intubation. This can occur for many different reasons. One cause is excessive tension on the tubing. Cheesewiring can also occur late as scar tissue forms around the tubing. The scar tissue fixes the tube in place and prevents the movement in the canalicular system with each blink creating problems. The tubing must be removed if cheesewiring is greater than 3 mm. Technique for removal of the cheesewire suture Whether intentional or non-intentionally occurring, a cheesewire suture can be removed in surgery. A cheesewire suture is removed by a small incision made in the conjunctiva overlying the two ends of the suture. Fine removal suture forceps are used to grasp both ends of the suture. Tangential traction is then used to cheesewire through the scar tissue There are many complications that can arise from the removal of the cheesewire suture. In the eye specifically, suture breaking can result in significant tissue scarring. This results in a large amount of traction force required to remove the suture. Occular Hypotony and hypheama following the removal of cheesewire sutures are also common occurrences Reducing Cheesewiring Suture Drag Surgeons can take several precautions to help decrease the probability of cheesewiring occurring. One technique determined to decrease suture drag is placement of the needle perpendicularly through the entire corneal thickness encompassed by the suture bite on each side of the incision. Certain sutures are also more prone to cheesewiring. 3-0 Vicryl is one of the least likely sutures to experience cheesewiring. Sutures may also be coated in materials to reduce tissue drag. Monofilament sutures create less drag while passing through tissue, but may decrease tensile strength and cause crimping. Therefore, multifilament sutures are more commonly used to prevent the occurrence of cheesewiring despite a decrease in mechanical properties Factors such as the type and size of the needle, suture type and thickness, and suture placement should all be considered as all factors have a significant effect on the surgical result. For instance, having a suture that is too short can lead to inflammation in tissue, while a suture that is too tight can cause necrosis, especially in association with significant edema As an intentional procedure The term can also be used to name the process of using a guidewire or suture intentionally to cut through tissue during a surgical procedure or allowing a suture to slowly cut through tissue over time. Examples of cheesewiring used intentionally include treating fistulas, use in trabeculectomies, and to aid in endovascular aortic repair / Cheesewiring As Used in Treatment of a Fistula Treatment of fistulas often involves placing a suture and allowing it to cut off the fistula over time Cheesewiring As Used in a Trabeculectomy Cheesewiring is used as an intentional procedure in a trabeculectomy. In a trabecuectomy, a loop of 8-0 nylon sutures is placed under the scleral flap. The cheesewiring suture allows rescuing failing or failed bleb, by mechanically breaking down the subscleral flap. In this procedure, a triangular partial thickness scleral flap is created using a diamond knife. The scleral flap is then extended to the limbus that is hinged anteriorly. A sclerotomy is then made with a punch followed by a peripheral iridectomy. An 8-0 nylon suture is then passed through the conjunctiva from the external aspect into the subconjunctival space. This process creates the cheesewiring effect. The needle is entered 3 mm from the lateral edge of the future bleb site and 3-4 mm away from the limbus. The 8-0 nylon suture is taken under the scleral flap. Once this happens, the suture is reversed and the needle is passed through the conjunctiva from the inside towards the outside position. A singular 10-0 vicryl suture can secure the scleral flap and then the cheesewire suture can then be cut flush to the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva flap can be then secured with 26 10-0 vicryl sutures at either end of the limbus. A single 10-0 vicryl mattress suture can be placed in the middle. This entire process allows for blebs to be rescued. Cheesewiring as to aid in Endovascular Aortic valve repair Cheesewiring is commonly used in the endovascular repair. The cheesewire technique can be used to fenestrate an intimal flap, alleviating malperfusion in aortic dissection. Pulling both ends of a guide wire in a caudally sawing motion down through the infrarenal neck and into the aneurysm sac completes the technique. This process shears the flap with minimal damage.

History The BUKC, originally called the Inter Universities Karting Championship (IUKC), was formed in 2001 by students Will Tew and Tom Batho from Imperial College London. Prior to 2001 the IUKC was organised by students from Cardiff University and then the University of Nottingham and ran using 4-stroke variety karts. This all changed for the 2001/02 season with the beginning of an association with Club100, who supply a fleet of arrive-and-drive two-stroke TKM karts. The IUKC 2001/02 became the first ever university karting championship to be run on 2-stroke machinery and was contested by 32 teams, over 4 rounds. It was won by Loughborough University. In 2003, the format was altered, with a fifth round added; and the championship renamed to the British Universities Karting Championship. In order to keep the organisation consistent and the relationship with partners Club100 strong, 3T Racing Ltd was founded by Will and Tom in 2003 as an independent governing body for the championship. In 2018 the BUKC will be contested by 52 teams from universities across the United Kingdom over 8 rounds, with another 48 competing in the Rookies Championship. Format The BUKC uses a unique format that uses teams of 4 drivers, and takes place over a number of rounds during the academic year at many top class karting venues throughout the UK. Two different formats are used in the BUKC: The Sprint Format The Sprint Format is where every driver in the team gets to race in their own individual 25-minute race. No fuel stops, no driver changes. Just a 25-minute sprint to the flag. The teams finishing score for the round is determined by adding up the best 3 results from the 4 sprint races. The Endurance Format The Endurance Format is where the team (of 4 drivers) is split into two teams of 2. Each mini-team of 2 drivers races in a one-hour race. 2 fuel stops must be made, and at least one driver change must be made. The teams finishing score for the round is determined by adding up the points from both the 2 one-hour races. Karts The BUKC are supplied with Club100Club100.co.uk karts for the championship. These are Birel N35 chassis, powered by Rotax 125cc (as of 2019) 2-stroke engines that are capable of speeds in excess of 70 mph. The karts use Vega RH8 Slicks in all weather, due to the logistical challenges presented with changing an entire fleet in a short period of time. Universities taking part The championship is open to teams from any UK institution of higher education. Each university may be represented by more than one team of four drivers; Loughborough University fielded three teams in 2008, with many universities following suit (Sheffield University attempted to qualify 5 teams for the 2015 season). Loughborough and Oxford Brookes are the most successful teams in the championship's history, with 5 titles to their names. The series is most popular among universities in the south of England; however, Wales is well represented, with Cardiff University and Swansea University taking part, and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David (formerly Swansea Metropolitan) came 2nd overall in 2009. In 2009 Edinburgh became the first Scottish team to take part in the championships, with Heriot-Watt following in 2010. For the 2015 season, the University of the West of Scotland is the third Scottish University to take part, successfully qualifying for the main championship. In 2014, the Dublin Institute of Technology became the first Irish university to race in the BUKC, taking part in the annual 24-hour race that closes out the end of every season in June, although it is not an official round of the championship.

(see also environmental policy) and an academic field of study focused on three core components:Carter, Neil. 2007. The Politics of the Environment: Ideas, Activism, Policy, 2nd ed. New York: Cambridge University Press. * The study of political theories and ideas related to the environment; * The examination of the environmental stances of both mainstream political parties and environmental social movements; and * The analysis of public policymaking and implementation affecting the environment, at multiple geo-political levels. Neil Carter, in his foundational text Politics of the Environment (2009), suggests that environmental politics is distinct in at least two ways: first, \\"it has a primary concern with the relationship between human society and the natural world\\" (page 3); and second, \\"unlike most other single issues, it comes replete with its own ideology and political movement\\" (page 5, drawing on Michael Jacobs, ed., Greening the Millenium?, 1997). Further, he distinguishes between modern and earlier forms of environmental politics, in particular conservationism and preservationism. Contemporary environmental politics \\"was driven by the idea of a global ecological crisis that threatened the very existence of humanity.\\" And \\"modern environmentalism was a political and activist mass movement which demanded a radical transformation in the values and structures of society.\\" Environmental concerns were rooted in the vast social changes that took place in the United States after World War II. Although environmentalism can be identified in earlier years, only after the war did it become widely shared social priority. This began with outdoor recreation in the 1950s, extended into the wider field of the protection of natural environments, and then became infused with attempts to cope with air and water pollution and still later with toxic chemical pollutants. After World War II, environmental politics became a major public concern.Hays, Samuel P., and Barbara D. Hays. Beauty, Health, and Permanence: Environmental Politics in the United States, 1955-1985. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1987. Print. The development of environmentalism in the United Kingdom emerged in this period following the great London smog of 1952 and the Torrey Canyon oil spill of 1967. This is reflected by the emergence of Green politics in the Western world beginning in the 1970s.  Democratic challenges  Climate change is slow relative to political cycles of leadership in electoral democracies, which impedes responses by politicians who are elected and re-elected on much shorter timescales. In the United States, although \\"environmentalism\\" was once considered a White phenomenon, scholars have identified \\"pro-environment positions among Latino, African-American, and non- Hispanic white respondents,\\" with growing environmental concern especially among Latinos.Whittaker, Matthew, Segura, and Bowler, Shaun (2005). \\"Racial/Ethnic Group Attitudes Toward Environmental Protection in California: Is \\"Environmentalism\\" Still a White Phenomenon?\\" Political Research Quarterly (58)3: pp. 435, 435-447. Other scholars have similarly noted that Asian Americans are strongly pro-environmental, with some variation among ethnic subgroups. Effectively responding to global warming necessitates some form of international environmental governance to achieve shared targets related to energy consumption and environmental usage. Climate change complicates political ideology and practice, affecting conceptions of responsibility for future societies as well as economic systems. Material inequality between nations make technological solutions insufficient for climate change mitigation. Rather, political solutions can navigate the particularities of various facets of environmental crisis. Climate change mitigation strategies can be at odds with democratic priorities of prosperity, progress, and state sovereignty, and instead underscore a collective relationship with the environment. The international political community is presently based on liberal principles that prioritize individual freedoms and capitalist systems that make quick and ambitious climate responses difficult. Interest-group liberalism is guided by individual human priorities. Groups unable to voice their self-interest, such as minorities without suffrage, or non-humans, are not included in the political compromise. Addressing environmental crises can be impeded when citizens of liberal democracies do not see environmental problems as impacting their lives, or when they lack the education to evaluate the importance of the problem. The human benefits from environmental exploitation and protection compete. Considering the implications of ecological degradation for future human generations can give environmental concerns a basis in anthropocentric liberal democratic politics. William Ophuls posits that liberal democracies are unfit to address environmental problems, and that the prioritization of these challenges would involve a transition to more authoritarian forms of government. Others counter this by pointing to the past successes of environmental reform movements to improve water and air quality in liberal societies. In practice, environmentalism can improve democracy rather than necessitate its end, by expanding democratic participation and promoting political innovations. The tensions between liberal democracy and environmental goals raise questions about the possible limitations of democracy (or at least democracy as we know it): in its responsiveness to subtle but large-scale problems, its ability to work from a holistic societal perspective, its aptness in coping with environmental crisis relative to other forms of government. Democracies do not have the provisions to make environmental reforms that are not mandated by voters, and many voters lack incentives or desire to demand policies that could compromise immediate prosperity. The question arises as to whether the foundation of politics is morality or practicality. A scheme that conceives of and values the environment beyond its human utility, an environmental ethics, could be crucial for democracies to respond to climate change.  Alternative forms of democracy for environmental policy  In political theory, deliberative democracy has been discussed as a political model more compatible with environmental goals. Deliberative democracy is a system in which informed political equals weigh values, information, and expertise, and debate priorities to make decisions, as opposed to a democracy based on interest aggregation. This definition of democracy emphasizes informed discussion among citizens in the decision making process, and encourages decisions to benefit the common good rather than individual interests. Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson claimed that reason prevails over self-interest in deliberative democracy, making it a more just system. The broad perspective that this discursive model encourages could lead to a stronger engagement with environmental concerns. When compared to non-democracies, democracies are in fact more cooperative in climate change policy creation, but not necessarily on the outcome and effects of these policies. In political theory, the lottery system is a democratic design that allows governments to address problems with future, rather than immediate, impacts. Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected representatives can draft environmental policies that have short-term costs without considering the political consequences for re- election.  New materialism and environmental justice  New materialism is a strain of thought in philosophy and the social sciences that conceives of all material as having life or agency. It criticizes frameworks of justice that center on human attributes like consciousness as insufficient for modern ethical problems that concern the natural environment. It is a post-humanist consideration of all matter that rejects arguments of utility that privilege humans. This politically relevant social theory combats inequality beyond the interpersonal plane. People are ethically responsible for one another, and for the physical spaces they navigate, including animal and plant life, and the inanimate matter that sustains it, like soil. New materialism encourages political action according to this world vision, even if it is incompatible with economic growth. Jane Bennett uses the term \\"vital materialism\\" in her book Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things. She develops the concept of materialism with the aim of providing a stronger basis in political theory for environmental politics. New materialists have invoked Derrida and other historical thinkers to trace the emergence of their philosophy and to justify their environmental claims: > \\"No justice ... seems possible or thinkable without the principle of some > responsibility, beyond all living present, within that which disjoins the > living present, before the ghosts of those who are not yet born or who are > already dead [...]. Without this non-contemporaneity with itself of the > living present ... without this responsibility and this respect for justice > concerning those who are not there, of those who are no longer or who are > not yet present and living, what sense would there be to ask the question > 'where?' 'where tomorrow?' 'whither?'\\" All material, living and dead, is interrelated in \\"the mesh\\" as described by Timothy Morton. As all matter is interdependent, humans have obligations to all parts of the material world, including those that are unfamiliar. New materialism is related to a shift from the view of the environment as a form of capital to a form of labor (see Ecosystem services).  Emerging nations  Brazil, Russia, India, and China (known as the \\"BRIC\\" nations) are rapidly industrializing, and are increasingly responsible for global carbon emissions and the associated climate change. Other forms of environmental degradation have also accompanied the economic growth in these nations. Environmental degradation tends to motivate action more than the threat of global warming does, since air and water pollution cause immediate health problems, and because pollutants can damage natural resources, hampering economic potential. 322x322px With rising incomes, environmental degradation tends to decrease in industrializing nations, as depicted in the Environmental Kuznets Curve (described in a section of the Kuznets Curve article). Citizens demand better air and water quality, and technology becomes more efficient and clean when incomes increase. The level of income per capita needed to reverse the trend of environmental degradation in industrializing nations varies with the environmental impact indicator. More developed nations can facilitate eco- friendly transitions in emerging economies by investing in the development of clean technologies. Laws implemented in response to environmental concerns vary by nation (see List of environmental laws by country).  China  China's environmental ills include acid rain, severe smog, and a reliance on coal-burning for energy. China has instated environmental policies since the 1970s, and has one of the most extensive environmental conservation programs on paper. However, regulation and enforcement by the central government in Beijing are weak, so solutions are decentralized. Wealthier provinces are far more effective in their preservation and sustainable development efforts than poorer regions. China therefore provides an example of the consequences of environmental damage falling disproportionately on the poor. NGOs, the media, and the international community have all contributed to China's response to environmental problems. For history, laws, and policies, see Environmental policy in China.  India  In 1976, the Constitution of India was amended to reflect environmental priorities, motivated in part by the potential threat of natural resource depletion to economic growth: > \\"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to > safeguard the forests and wildlife.\\" (Art. 48A) > \\"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India [...] to protect and improve > the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and > to have compassion for living creatures.\\" (Art. 51A) However, in India, as in China, the implementation of written environmental policies, laws, and amendments has proven challenging. Official legislation by the central government (see a partial list at Environmental policy of the Government of India) is often more symbolic than practical. The Ministry of Environment and Forests was established in 1985, but corruption within bureaucratic agencies, namely the influence of wealthy industry leaders, limited any attempts at enforcement of the policies put in place.

Epstein (November 6, 1935 ‚Äì February 18, 2019) was an American psychiatrist who uses mental imagery and other mental techniques to treat physical and emotional problems. An author and a researcher, he was the founder and director of a mental imagery school for post-graduate mental health professionals, teaching imagery as a tool for healing and a \\"bridge to the inner world\\".Brussat, Frederic and Mary Ann. Spiritual Rx: Prescriptions for Living a Meaningful Life, Hyperion, New York 2000, p.viii Education and early professional career Epstein received his formal training as a medical doctor at New York Medical College, New York, NY, graduating in 1961. In 1961-62, he completed a rotating internship at Stamford Hospital, Stamford, CT, and in 1962-65, he took a residency in psychiatry at Kings County Hospital, Brooklyn, NY. In 1965, he began a private practice in New York City as a psychoanalyst. He trained in Freudian psychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, graduating in 1972. In 1973, he co-founded The Journal of Psychiatry and Law, which Epstein edited from 1973 through 1986. In 1975, he became an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at New York's Mt. Sinai Medical Center. Epiphany In 1974, Epstein experienced what he calls an \\"epiphany\\". In Jerusalem as a visiting professor in law and psychiatry, he met a young man who reported that three years of extensive psychoanalysis had not succeeded in freeing him of his depression but that four sessions with a local healer who practiced \\"waking dream therapy\\" had cured him. Epstein arranged a meeting with the healer, a woman named Colette Aboulker-Muscat, who, at her death in 2003, \\"had an international reputation as a . . . healer of body and mind who employed visualization and dream interpretation.\\"http://talkingdream.blogspot.com/2007/08/jerusalem-report-repo Epstein's epiphany came after he suggested to Aboulker-Muscat that since Freud had proposed to analysts that they elicit free association by asking patients to imagine being on a train with an analyst and describing to the analyst everything the patient sees while looking out a window, one could consider Freud's free association a form of mental imagery. Aboulker-Muscat asked, \\"In what direction does the train go?\\" Disconcerted, Epstein made a horizontal gesture with his hand. Aboulker-Muscat made a vertical gesture in response. \\"What if the direction was changed to this axis?\\" Fifteen years later, Epstein described this moment in born-again language: > I felt an overwhelming sense of self-recognition, an 'aha' experience. It > was an epiphany. The vertical movement seemed to lift me from the horizontal > hold of the given, the ordinary patterns of everyday cause and effect. I > leapt into freedom, and I saw that the task of therapy . . . was to help > realize freedom, to go beyond the given to the newness that we all are > capable of. . . .This is what imagery, I have come to learn, makes possible. Epstein studied imagery with Aboulker-Muscat for nine years. In New York, he closed his Freudian practice and opened a new practice based on mental imagery.Epstein, Gerald. Healing Visualizations: Creating Health Through Imagery, Bantam Books, New York 1989, p 7 Imagery institute In 1982, Epstein founded and became the director of The Colette Aboulker-Muscat Center for Waking Dream Therapy, a post-graduate training center for imagery chartered by the New York State Regents. The school offers post-graduate courses for licensed mental health professionals and provides classes for the general public. In 1994, the school was renamed The American Institute for Mental Imagery.http://www.regents.nysed.gov/Summaries/0408summaries.htm Books Epstein's first book for fellow professionals appeared in 1980, Studies in Non-Deterministic Psychology, an edited collection of papers (two by Epstein) presenting \\"outstanding\\" analytic efforts to develop \\"integrated non-deterministic\\" approaches to understanding human behavior.Epstein, Gerald. Studies in Non-Deterministic Psychology, Human Sciences Press, New York 1980, p v A second book for professionals was published in 1981, Waking Dream Therapy: Dream Process as Imagination, which examines the method and purpose of waking dream, a process in which a patient continues in waking life the action of a dream from a previous night. The result, Epstein claims, is freedom from the conditioned behavior that \\"we habitually live with.\\"Epstein, Gerald. Waking Dream Therapy: Dream Process as Imagination, Human Sciences Press, New York 1981, p 18 In 1989, Epstein's first self-help book appeared, Healing Visualizations: Creating Health Through Imagery, a collection of imagery exercises for treating 76 physical or emotional ailments, arranged alphabetically from acne to worry.Epstein, Gerald. Healing Visualizations: Creating Health Through Imagery, Bantam Books, New York 1989 In its 19th printing , with more than 100,000 copies in print, it has been translated into 11 languages and published in 13 countries.Subsidiary rights department, Bantam Books, New York, NY A second self-help book appeared in 1994, Healing Into Immortality: A New Spiritual Medicine of Healing Stories and Imagery, in which Epstein argues that \\"the essential teaching of spiritual medicine is that we possess the means for healing ourselves through the use of our inner mental processes\\" and that these processes derive from the Bible.Epstein, Gerald. Healing Into Immortality: A New Spiritual Medicine of Healing Stories and Imagery, Bantam Books, New York 1994, p 1 In 1999, Epstein released Climbing Jacob's Ladder: Finding Spiritual Freedom through Stories in the Bible, \\"a fresh understanding of the biblical stories that inform the spiritual heritage and practices of the West.\\" His next book, Kabbalah for Inner Peace, provides a contemporary approach to the 4,000 year old spiritual tradition known as Visionary Kabbalah - interweaving the teaching with more than 60 imagery exercises. In November 2012, he co-edited the Encyclopedia of Mental Imagery with Barbarah Fedoroff. This book serves as a compendium of 2100 mental imagery exercises, drawn from the original work of Colette Aboulker-Muscat. This work was named one of \\"The Best Spiritual Books of 2012\\" by Spirituality & Practice. Epstein's next work, Love Trumps Death, is scheduled for release Fall 2016. Audios In 2003, Epstein's issued his first audio, an eight CD set, The Natural Laws of Self-Healing, which consists of twelve \\"laws\\" drawn from his practice and his study and understanding of the spiritual principles of life.Epstein, Gerald. The Natural Laws of Self Healing, Nightingale Conant, Chicago 2003 A second audio, a 6-CD set, appeared in 2007, The Phoenix Process: One-Minute a Day to Health, Longevity, and Well- Being, which describes four self-help practices, one for each of four common life problems‚Äîself-doubt, feelings of emergency, indecisiveness, and physical and emotional ailments ‚Äì all of which, Epstein argues, physically wear away the body and shorten one's life.Epstein, Gerald. The Phoenix Process: One- Minute a Day to Health, Longevity and Well-Being, Nightingale Conant, Chicago 2007 In 2010, he released Emotional Mastery: Life Transformation Through Higher Consciousness, a work intended for learning to face the stresses of the everyday life: including moving beyond negative states of mind, finding the right job, creating income, and improving your self-image.Healing Visualizations, Epstein's first and best known self-help work, was released in audiobook format in 2014. Research Waking dream Toward the end of the 1970s, Epstein participated in a study of 127 subjects to investigate the experiences of \\"self-hypnosis, waking dreaming, and mindfulness meditation.\\" Reports by participants indicated that the images they experienced in waking dream had a more \\"vivid inner reality,\\" that they were more aware of the images' \\"immediate impact,\\" and that they were less likely to see the images as their own creation.Brown, Daniel; Forte, Michael; Rich, Philip; Epstein, Gerald. \\"Phenomenological Differences Among Self Hypnosis, Mindfulness Meditation, and Imaging,\\" Imagination, Cognition and Personality, Vol 2(4), 1982-83, pp 291-309 Asthma In the mid 1990s, Epstein collaborated with Elizabeth Ann Manhart Barrett, then the coordinator of the Center for Nursing Research at Hunter College, City University of New York, and with other colleagues, to conduct two studies on the use of mental imagery by adults experiencing asthma. The first study, funded by the Office of Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, examined the quantitative effects of imagery, comparing 17 participants who used mental imagery as a treatment for their asthma and 16 participants who did not. Among the group using mental imagery, eight people (47 percent) reduced or discontinued their medication, while in the group not using imagery, no one discontinued their medication and only three people (19 percent) reduced it. People using imagery also indicated that they had increased their ability to make choices and their overall power to create changes in their lives.Epstein, Gerald; Halper, JP; Barrett, EAM; Birdsall, C; McGee, M; Baron, KP; Lowenstein, S. \\"A pilot study of mind-body changes in adults with asthma who practice mental imagery,\\" Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, July/Aug 2004, pp 66-71 The second study used a phenomenological, qualitative approach to explore the experience of the people using mental imagery to alleviate their asthma. With responses from 14 participants, researchers found that the use of mental imagery helped these people to feel more powerful and in some cases \\"profoundly affected\\" in favorable ways their views of themselves‚Äîfor example, relieving them of the fear that they would forget their inhaler and die from an asthma attack.Epstein, Gerald; Barrett, EAM; Halper, JP; Seriff, N; Phillips, KY; Lowenstein, S. \\"Alleviating asthma with mental imagery: A phenomenological approach,\\" Alternative & Complementary Therapies, February 1997, pp 42-52 Critical reception Epstein has consistently maintained that imagery works in a matter of minutes or less when used for a number of days. Martin Rossman, also a practitioner of mental imagery and the author of a book on imagery,Rossman, Martin. Healing Yourself: A Step-by-Step Program for Better Health through Imagery, Walker & Company, New York 1987 challenged this contention in a review of Healing Visualizations, pointing to an exercise that Epstein claimed could remove the feeling of aimlessness if done \\"once a day, for three to five minutes, for three days.\\" Rossman wrote: > Perhaps Dr. Epstein is seeing patients less seriously aimless than I, . . . > but I . . . have not generally seen loss of direction in life to respond to > nine minutes of treatment with or without visualization.Rossman, Martin L. > \\"Inner Eyes,\\" Advances, Vol 6, No 4 1989, pp 66-67 Epstein responded that his claims were based on his clinical experiences. > All of the imagery in Healing Visualizations has been tried in clinical > situations over the . . . years that I have made imagery the central focus > and treatment modality of my clinical work. . .

DGVMs use time series of climate data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes. DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future climate change on natural vegetation and its carbon and water cycles. DGVMs generally combine biogeochemistry, biogeography, and disturbance submodels. Disturbance is often limited to wildfires, but in principle could include any of: forest/land management decisions, windthrow, insect damage, ozone damage etc. DGVMs usually \\"spin up\\" their simulations from bare ground to equilibrium vegetation (e.g. climax community) to establish realistic initial values for their various \\"pools\\": carbon and nitrogen in live and dead vegetation, soil organic matter, etc. corresponding to a documented historical vegetation cover. DGVMs are usually run in a spatially distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of \\"cells\\", geographic points which are assumed to have homogeneous conditions within each cell. Simulations are carried out across a range of spatial scales, from global to landscape. Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc- seconds.

He is the Founding Dean of the Division of Life Sciences and served as Vice President for Health Science Partnerships.Faculty Profile of Kenneth Breslauer New VP for Health Science Partnerships at Rutgers, Office for Media Relation website Kenneth Breslauer‚Äôs research focuses on defining and characterizing the molecular forces that control communication between biological molecules, particularly those interactions that modulate and control gene expression, DNA damage repair, mutagenesis, and drug binding. Breslauer arrived at the University as an assistant professor in 1974. Research Breslauer determined a DNA database that allows one to energetically map genome sequence information so as to correlate regions of differential stabilities with regions of differential biological functions.Breslauer Named Rutgers VP for Health Science Partnerships The database and its extensions also have been used to design probes and drugs with predictable hybridization and binding properties, a capability key to various diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. Breslauer has mapped the energetic consequences of DNA damage, knowledge critical to understanding the mechanisms of DNA repair, including why certain mutations escape repair and result in cancer. Most recently, Breslauer has elucidated the significance of metastable states within the rough energy landscapes of DNA molecules, information critical to our understanding of the molecular origins of triple repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease and fragile X syndrome. Breslauer is the Executive Editor of Biopolymers,The Editorial Board of Biopolymers a major journal in his field, and is founding editor of Nucleic Acid Sciences.Nucleic Acid Sciences He also serves on numerous scientific advisory boards, including those associated with the Cancer Institute of New Jersey,The Cancer Institute of New Jersey the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine,the CABM Advisors as well as federal funding agency study sections. Deanship As a Dean, Breslauer reorganized the life sciences into an administratively and programmatically integrated structure, the Division of Life Sciences (DLS). This entity encompasses three departments (Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Genetics, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry); two sections (Biological Chemistry, Behavioral Neuropsychology); multiple centers and institutes (the Biomaterials Center, the Human Genetics Institute, the Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository, the W. M. Keck Center Collaborative Neurosciences, the Spinal Cord Injury Project, the Rutgers Stem Cell Research Center, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, etc.) and partnerships with existing life sciences centers, institutes, and schools. And a broad range of Core Facilities (confocal microscopy, high-field NMR, Mass Spectrometry, Calorimetry and Spectroscopy, Imaging, etc.). The Division of Life sciences also comprises the Office of Undergraduate Instruction (OUGI), which includes the Office of Diversity and Academic Success in the Sciences(ODASIS), the Health Professions Office(HPO); as well as the Graduate Office in Molecular Biosciences. Administratively, under the direction of a Business Office, the DLS provides centralized grants management, procurement, personnel management, facilities maintenance and oversight, and IT support. Programmatically, an overarching theme of the DLS is the focus on translational research in which knowledge from the laboratory bench is rapidly translated into treatments at the bedside of the patient W.M. Keck Center for spinal cord injury, the New Jersey Center for biomaterials, the New Jersey Stem Cell institute and the Waksman Institute of Microbiology.The Division of Life sciences‚Äô webpage Since 2005, the Divisional office is partly housed in the new Life Sciences building on the Busch campus,; a magnificent facility that represents the culmination of nearly a decade long campaign by Breslauer to build critically needed space for life science development. Currently, the building houses the New Jersey Center for Biomaterials, the Human Genetics Institute, and the Rutgers Department of Genetics.Creating a Life-Sciences Power Play at Rutgers NJBIZ, Jun 6, 2005 by Quinn, Bill As Vice President for health science partnerships, Breslauer has assumed a leadership role in establishing with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey the Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey, the Center for Clinical Translational Sciences, Shared Major Instrumentation Research Facilities, as well as partnerships with universities in China, Taiwan, Africa, and elsewhere, including mutually beneficial cooperative agreements with the private sector. Personal background Kenneth Breslauer was born in J√∂nk√∂ping, Sweden and raised in the Jackson Heights section of Queens in New York City. His parents were natives of Germany but fled the country during Hitler‚Äôs era. His father‚Äôs father, George Breslauer, was a supreme court justice in Germany before Hitler came to power. His mother‚Äôs father, Hans Sch√§ffer, was an undersecretary of the treasury for the Weimar Republic from 1928 to 1932.‚ÄúThe Breslauers and a man named Adolf‚Äù, Carol Gordon Carlson, Rutgers Magazine, May/June 1988, p28 whose diaries were donated to the Leo Baeck Institute in Manhattan.The Diaries of Hans Schaeffer at the Leo Baeck Institute His older brother is former UC Berkeley Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost George W.

Education and professional career Although he started college as a history major, Kenneth Breslauer graduated in 1968 with honors from the University of Wisconsin, with both a bachelor's degree in chemistry as well as a B.A. degree.Faculty Profile of Kenneth Breslauer During high school and his freshman year in college, Breslauer played left field on his schools‚Äô baseball teams, and, subsequently, for a brief period, he followed his passion and played minor league baseball in West Haven, Connecticut. Breslauer was a baseball standout at McBurney High School in New York City (Class of 1964). During his PhD research at Yale University, Breslauer developed a new calorimetric method for investigating the molecular forces that control the stability and folding of proteins, His results were incorporated in databases for characterizing hydrophobic and hydrophilic forces associated with protein stability. He graduated from Yale in 1972. As a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley, Breslauer investigated and characterized the molecular forces associated with dictating and controlling nucleic acid stability. At Rutgers since 1974, he combines these fields by investigating protein-DNA, and drug-DNA interactions, particularly as they relate to regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair, and molecular diseases. Breslauer is author of over 200 publications. His most cited paper describes a model and presents a database that has been used throughout the field to predict DNA duplex stability from the base sequence, and it is cited over 1000 times.PREDICTING DNA DUPLEX STABILITY FROM THE BASE SEQUENCE, KJ Breslauer et al., PNAS Vol 83, pp 3746-3750, June 1986 This paper and subsequent work from his laboratory have led to a patent being issued to Breslauer and co-workers (No. 6,815,163) entitled ‚ÄúMethods and Kits for Screening Nucleic Acid Duplex Stability.‚ÄùBreslauer's patent at the World Intellectual Property Organization Awards 1970: Wolfgang Prize for outstanding teaching at Yale 1981: Humboldt Fellowship Award for research in Germany 1985: Sunner Medal, as the nation‚Äôs outstanding, ‚Äúyoung‚Äù biothermodynamicist 1987: Johnson & Johnson Research Discovery Award Faculty Profile of Kenneth Breslauer 1995: Huffman Memorial Award 1996: Elected Fellow of the AAAS Fellows of the AAAS References Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:American biochemists Category:Yale University alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kenneth Breslauer"},{"id":"20330367","text":"Alfina Nassyrova (Kazakhstani Russian: –ê–ª—å—Ñ–∏–Ω–∞ –ù–∞—Å—ã—Ä–æ–≤–∞; born 11 June 1988) is a Kazakh model who won the national pageant Miss Kazakhstan in 2007 held at the Abai State Kazakh National Opera & Ballet Theatre in Almaty.

The term is used to describe what they consider to be the common beliefs among U.S. youths. The book is the result of the research project the \\"National Study of Youth and Religion\\".  Definition  The author's study found that many young people believe in several moral statutes not exclusive to any of the major world religions. It is not a new religion or theology as such, but identified as a set of commonly held spiritual beliefs. It is this combination of beliefs that they label moralistic therapeutic deism: These points of belief were compiled from interviews with approximately 3,000 teenagers.R. Albert Mohler, Jr., Moralistic Therapeutic Deism--the New American Religion, Christian Post, 18 April 2005.  Authors' analysis  The authors say the system is \\"moralistic\\" because it \\"is about inculcating a moralistic approach to life. It teaches that central to living a good and happy life is being a good, moral person.\\" The authors describe the system as being \\"about providing therapeutic benefits to its adherent\\" as opposed to being about things like \\"repentance from sin, of keeping the Sabbath, of living as a servant of a sovereign divine, of steadfastly saying one's prayers, of faithfully observing high holy days, of building character through suffering ...\\" and further as \\"belief in a particular kind of God: one who exists, created the world, and defines our general moral order, but not one who is particularly personally involved in one's affairs‚Äîespecially affairs in which one would prefer not to have God involved.\\" The remoteness of God in this kind of theism explains the choice of the term deism, even though \\"the Deism here is revised from its classical eighteenth-century version by the therapeutic qualifier, making the distant God selectively available for taking care of needs.\\" It views God as \\"something like a combination Divine Butler and Cosmic Therapist: he's always on call, takes care of any problems that arise, professionally helps his people to feel better about themselves, and does not become too personally involved in the process.\\" The authors believe that \\"a significant part of Christianity in the United States is actually only tenuously Christian in any sense that is seriously connected to the actual historical Christian tradition, but has rather substantially morphed into Christianity's misbegotten stepcousin, Christian Moralistic Therapeutic Deism.\\" CNN online featured an article, \\"More Teens Becoming Fake Christians\\" on Kenda Creasy Dean's 2010 book Almost Christian: What the Faith of Our Teenagers is Telling the American Church. (Oxford University Press, 2010). She writes, \\"The problem does not seem to be that churches are teaching young people badly, but that we are doing an exceedingly good job of teaching youth what we really believe, namely, that Christianity is not a big deal, that God requires little, and the church is a helpful social institution filled with nice people‚Ä¶\\" She goes on to say that \\"if churches practice MTD in the name of Christianity, then getting teenagers to church more often is not the solution (conceivably it could make things worse). A more faithful church is the solution .... Maybe the issue is simply that the emperor has no clothes.\\"  Criticism  One criticism of moralistic therapeutic deism is that it is more of a general worldview than a religion or theology in itself. The above-mentioned moral concepts of MTD (what the original study called the \\"5 core beliefs\\") are not unique to any particular religion or spiritual practice. They can, however, be seen as principles extracted and generalized from orthodox Christianity, but devoid of specific doctrines about God and humanity. A second criticism is that the term is tendentious rather than descriptive, since, as even the originators admit, \\"no teenager would actually use the terminology 'Moralistic Therapeutic Deist' to describe himself or herself\\". The expression could be used to denigrate a set of beliefs less traditional than one's own.  Commentary  Damon Linker suggested in a 2009 blog post that moralistic therapeutic deism, while theologically \\"insipid\\", is \\"perfectly suited to serve as the civil religion of the highly differentiated twenty-first century United States\\", a contention that was disputed by Collin Hansen, Ross Douthat, and Rod Dreher.

The paper mill had previously been threatened with closure. Two weeks later, CG Holding penned a deal to buy the factory. The only remaining step was to negotiate the land rental with ABN Property. One week later, however, ABN had proposed an altered deal for land rental. CG Holding accused the new contract of being unreasonable. In the end, CG Holding did take over the factory, but decided to cease production the next year. With no particular plans for the production facilities, ABN announced that the factory would lie fallow for the time being.

As Abkhazia is only recognised by Russia, Venezuela, Syria, Nicaragua and Nauru, for all other destinations Abkhazian citizens must use another passport (most of them use Russian passports) for international travel. Background Before the introduction of Abkhazian passports, Abkhazia still used Soviet Passports. These arrived in 1991 in Adjara, where they were not needed since Adjara and the rest of Georgia were introducing separate Georgian passports. They were then given by Adjar leader Aslan Abashidze to the Abkhazian authorities, although it is not known how or when. People who could not obtain a Soviet passport, for example because they had not yet turned 16 when the Soviet Union disbanded or many of the inhabitants of the Gali District received a 'form no. 9', meant to certify a loss of passport. The Soviet passports were set to expire in 2008, and so a new passport was needed. The issue of introducing an Abkhazian passport was first discussed towards the end of the nineties. In May 2000, Justice Minister Batal Tabagua announced that an order for empty passport forms placed with the Perm Goznak Manufacture had been cancelled by Russia's Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In 2003 finally passports were ordered from a private Turkish printing company, but the first shipment of 25,000 passports was intercepted and confiscated by Georgian authorities. The passports had been meant to be distributed before the 2004 Presidential election, but when the second batch arrived it became clear that the passports contained errors and so President Vladislav Ardzinba decided not to have them issued. After Sergei Bagapsh was elected to the presidency he decided not to waste the invested money and to introduce the passports in January 2006 despite the errors. Adoption The first passport was issued in January 2006 to former President Ardzinba, and the second passport posthumously to activist and academic Tamara Shakryl, who had been the only victim during the 2004 post-election crisis. President Bagapsh himself was the first person to regularly apply for an Abkhazian passport. By February 2007, Abkhazian passports had been issued to 33,000 people. This number subsequently rose to 45,000 in April, 53,000 in May, 63,000 in August, 110,000 in July 2008, 141,245 on 12 October 2009, 142,625 on 1 November. and 146,121 on 7 December. On 7 December 2009, the ethnic break- down of passport holders was as follows: {  -E9E9E9;\\" align=\\"left\\"Nationality align=\\"right\\"Passport holders align=\\"right\\"Percentage - Abkhaz align=\\"right\\"73,622 align=\\"right\\"50.4 - Armenians align=\\"right\\"32.363 align=\\"right\\"22.1 - Russians align=\\"right\\"17.795 align=\\"right\\"12.2 - Georgians align=\\"right\\"12.156 align=\\"right\\"8.3 - Ukrainians align=\\"right\\"2.430 align=\\"right\\"2.1 - Abazins align=\\"right\\"2.138 align=\\"right\\"1.7 - Greeks align=\\"right\\"1.500 align=\\"right\\"1.0 - Other align=\\"right\\"4.117 align=\\"right\\"2.8 -E9E9E9;\\" Total align=\\"right\\"146.121 align=\\"right\\"100.0 } Also, of the total number of passport holders, 9910 were under the age of 18, and 5759 lived outside Abkhazia. The Abkhazian government said in 2007 that once the distribution of passports was completed, it would be the only legal form of identification within Abkhazia. It was announced that from the beginning of 2008, citizens could no longer receive a Russian pension without an Abkhazian passport. Abkhazian passports became the only possible form of legitimation for voters starting with the December 2009 Presidential election. On 20 October 2009 it was announced that a new passport would be introduced with additional security features, so as to satisfy all international criteria. The new passports were to be printed by the Russian state enterprise Goznak. The original passports were insufficiently secure for cross-border travel with Russia. Abkhazia said it would start issuing passports to its citizens by the end of June 2010. Gali Controversy and 2014 revolution The issuing of passports in the Gali District was a priority for the government in order to better integrate its inhabitants into the rest of Abkhazia, but was controversial for various reasons. It was criticised by the Abkhazian opposition on the grounds that the large majority of inhabitants of the Gali District are Georgians who possess Georgian citizenship. The Abkhazian government responded to this by pointing out that Abkhazian citizenship law does not allow for dual citizenship (except for dual Abkhazian-Russian citizenship) and that therefore, Georgian citizens first had to renounce their Georgian citizenship before obtaining Abkhazian passports. Georgia in turn has accused Abkhazia of forcing its citizens in the Gali District to renounce their citizenship and take up Abkhazian passports, but this was denied by the Abkhazian government. According to the Abkhazian government, as of 12 October 2009, 3522 residents of the Gali District had acquired an Abkhazian passport. In April 2013, Head of the Interior Ministry's Passport and Visa Service Beslan Bigvava declared that 16,096 Georgians had received an Abkhazian passport in Gali District, 6217 in Ochamchira District and 2453 in Tquarchal District. The issuing of Abkhazian passports to Georgian residents became a key complaint of the opposition against the Government of President Ankvab, as it alleged that most recipients were not legally Abkhazian citizens, and one of the factors leading to the May 2014 revolution against Ankvab. New version (since 2016) On 18 May 2016, the first four copies of the new passport, produced by Goznak, were issued to war hero Garrik Adzinba, Deputy Head of the Cabinet of Ministers Zurab Marshan, Aslan Kapba and Alisa Inapshba. Design The cover of the Abkhazian passport is dark green, it displays the coat of arms of Abkhazia with above it the short name of the country (Abkhazia) and below the word 'passport', both in Abkhaz and in Russian.

Their manufacturing facility is located in Williston, South Carolina, United States. History Establishment Crane Merchandising Systems was founded in 1926 by B. E. Fry, a St. Louis businessman, as the \\"National Sales Machine Company.\\" Fry invented a more foolproof vending machine that would only accept coins, unlike older machines, such as the \\"Smoketeria\\", a cigarette vending machine, which would accept things such as flat buttons and cardboard discs. The Great Depression By 1931, National Sales Machine Company was a well established business, manufacturing a variety of merchandisers for various food products. However, The Great Depression proved too much for the company, and it went under in 1932. Soon thereafter, in the spring of 1933, Fry's son, B. W. Fry, reopened the company as National Vendors, Inc. In 1934, Al Diederich joined B. W. Fry in National Vendors, giving it the administrative strength it would need to grow during the tumultuous 30s and 40s. World War II - 1960s During World War II, National Vendors took part in the war effort by producing mortar ammunitions casings. After the war, the company returned to the demand for convenient cigarette, candy and pastry vendors. In 1956, National Vendors was acquired by the Universal Match Company, allowing National Vendors to introduce several new products. In 1967, National Vendors introduced its first full line of automatic merchandising equipment. CMS was acquired by Crane Corporation in 1985, and became Crane National Vendors. Present Day Today, Crane Merchandising Systems designs and manufactures a diverse, yet integrated portfolio of automatic merchandising equipment across multiple verticals, including hot and cold beverage, snack, and food. It also offers other vending solutions including Media touch screens, cashless processing, payment devices, vending management software, and wireless communication technology. The company is a segment of Crane Co., a diversified manufacturer of engineered industrial product. Crane Co. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:CR). Brad Tedder is the company's president. In 2017, CMS retired its legacy National, Dixie-Narco, GPL, and Automatic Products brands in favor of the single Crane Merchandising Systems brand for all its products.

He was the first to combine psychology, behavioral modification and a restricted calorie diet to obtain verifiable and documented long-term weight loss results. He is the author of the book The Structure House Weight Loss Plan: Achieve Your Ideal Weight Through a New Relationship with Food, printed by Simon & Schuster. In 1977, Musante founded the weight loss institute Structure House Inc. as an on-site residential weight loss center in Durham, NC. Over the past 30 years, Structure House has helped 30,000 people and, as of 1986, the center had more than 2,000 visitors a year. In 2007, Structure House was purchased by the CRC Health Group, the largest provider of specialized behavioral health care services in the United States;. Musante remains the director of the program. In a radio interview on the subject, Musante explained how his breakthrough came during a Clinical Psychology internship at Duke University when he discovered that patients who only followed a restricted intake of calories (diet) didn‚Äôt always have success. He experimented by pairing a diet with a psychological approach, and behavior modification during clinical sessions. During these sessions, he discovered that a patient‚Äôs relationship with food‚Äîtheir behavior in actually dealing with food could be altered. Structure House has been featured on The Today Show, The New York Times, Associated Press, 60 Minutes, Glamour Magazine, the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, CNN, Fox & Friends, USA TODAY, WebMD and Best Life. Musante has also contributed to and helped to publish over 30 papers and given numerous talks on the subject. In 2004 and 2006, he appeared as an expert in front of a 2006 congressional panel holding hearings on a bill designed to combat obesity in America.

They are commonly seen on horses in fast work, such as jumping, when in training, such as when longeing, or in competitions such as reining or eventing. Brushing injuries are more common on the forelegs, when one hoof catches the other leg, or when the fetlock or cannon bones hit each other. This can cause a serious injury on a horse's legs, especially if the horse is wearing shoes. Poor equine conformation can often lead to brushing, although even properly-conformed horses can also accidentally injure themselves. Brushing boots may also be placed on horses in the field to protect them if they get overly excited. Other reasons for use may include placement on a young or unfit horse which may be excitable and step on itself, or on horses subject to intense work that may stumble more if they are tired. Materials and structure neoprene brushing boots, front (longer) and rear (shorter) Modern brushing boots are usually made of synthetic materials such as Neoprene or traditional materials such as leather. They usually attach by a wide velcro fastening which is pulled around the leg, although they can also be pushed through a ring and be fastened back upon themselves, making them more secure and less likely to slip during exercise. They can have between 1 and 5 straps, with front leg boots usually having more straps. Some boots may have buckles, especially older designs. They have a protective padded area on the side of the boot which is on the inside of the horses leg, protecting the cannon bone and fetlock. They are made in a wide variety of colors and of varying styles. leather boots Fitting and use The boot is usually placed onto the horse with the straps facing towards the rear on the outside of the leg, unless the attachment design mandates a different placement. To ensure there is even pressure around the leg when putting the boot on, they are fastened middle strap first, then the others. Boots that are too tight can cause discomfort and pressure injuries, but those that are too loose may become dislodged or come off entirely. Incorrectly fitting boots will be uncomfortable for the horse and can cause rubbing and soreness, as well as impeding the horses movement. Sizing varies in different nations, but generally there are three to four size ranges for ponies, small or young horses, and large horses. Brushing boots are not to be worn for long periods as they can become uncomfortable for the horse, especially if the boots get wet or dirty which may cause irritation and sores. Care Boots made of synthetic materials are generally machine- washable. Leather boots are cleaned in the same manner as other leather horse tack, using saddle soap and similar products. Boots that are washed need to be fully dry before storage or reuse. Between uses, boots that are not washed are checked for accumulations of small stones or dirt which may irritate a horse's legs. *Brushing Boots *Q&A; Brushing Boots *Choosing the Right Boot Category:Horse protective equipment ","title":"Splint boots"},{"id":"20330579","text":"Anthon Bernhard Elias Nilsen (30 June 1855 - 6 December 1936) was a Norwegian businessman and politician for the Conservative Party.

It is one of 17 installations of the Joint Munitions Command and one of 23 organic industrial bases under the U.S. Army Materiel Command, which include arsenals, depots, activities and ammunition plants. Established in October 1977, it is located on Naval Support Activity Crane. Capabilities Capabilities of the center include: munitions and manufacturing; demilitarization; munitions and munitions-related maintenance and renovation; remote operations and environmental testing; logistics support; machine shop; chemical laboratory; and engineering. History Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA) was established on October 1, 1977, when the Army was designated as the single manager for conventional ammunition for the Department of Defense. CAAA inherited a legacy mission of conventional ammunition manufacturing, storage and depot operations from what had previously been known as Naval Ammunition Depot, Crane, born in 1941 when the Navy needed an inland munitions depot during World War II. CAAA became one of two major tenants on Naval Support Activity (NSA) Crane, eventually employing more than 700 employees and occupying 51,220 acres of land and 4.8 million square feet in buildings on the base. CAAA‚Äôs manufacturing product lines grew to include countermeasure decoy flares, mortar and artillery illumination, signals and markers, loading assembly and packing of medium caliber munitions, Navy gun ammunition, Air Force and Navy bomb maintenance, explosive melt/pour and press load operations. CAAA also remained focused on its logistical mission set, storing and distributing approximately 25% of the DoD‚Äôs conventional munitions valued at $9.8 billion, making it one of the largest ammunition depots in the DoD. On October 1, 1999, command and control of the Letterkenny Munitions Center (LEMC) in Chambersburg, PA, transferred to CAAA where it was aligned as a directorate in CAAA's organizational structure. CAAA‚Äôs commander was also given responsibility for oversight of the of Iowa and Milan Army Ammunition Plants.  Command  the commanding officer of CAAA was Colonel Stephen Dondero, the 19th commander. He replaced Col. Michael Garlington, who will retire after serving 27 years in the U.S. Army. Facilities The facilities at CAAA include more than 200 production buildings, a machine shop, roughly 1,800 storage buildings for both explosive and inert ammunition with a total capacity of , an demolition range and of ammunition burning grounds. Renovation Ordnance and pyrotechnic renovation work is accomplished in any number of flexible manufacturing units. Remote defuzing and refuzing capabilities are available for a variety of items. Propellant charge renovation is accomplished in multiple facilities configured with powder lofts.

Crane has produced a variety of aircraft decoy flares. Cast Load: Crane has the ability to produce cast loaded explosives utilizing various production lines with mixing, melting, and holding kettles. We have the capability to produce bombs, mines, shock test charges, demolition charges, shape charges, burster tubes, underwater sound signals, cluster bombs and projectiles. Machining Center: Crane‚Äôs machine shop is equipped with computer numerical control (CNC) machines (mills, lathes, laser fabrication center, wire electrical discharge machine, waterjet, etc.) for a wide variety of materials including tough alloys and metals. Cleaning and finishing processes include chemical cleaning, ultrasonic cleaner, turbo washer, plating titration, atomic absorption, powder coating, statistical process control and workstation automated data collectors. Logistics Shipping/Receiving: Crane receives, stores and ships a wide variety of conventional ammunition and munitions in support of worldwide operations. Logistics Facilities: Crane supports its magazines with both rail and truck access, blocking and bracing services and modern containerization facilities. Crane directly supports various units by receiving, storing and shipping their ammunition basic load as required. Preconfigured Containers: Crane containerizes preconfigured ammunition loads that are delivered directly to troops on the ground, to ships afloat or to prepositioned stocks. Demilitarization Disposal: Crane utilizes a wide variety of methods including automated high pressure washout, breakdown, steam-out, permitted open burning and open detonation, contained detonation, water-jet and white phosphorus to phosphoric acid conversion. Recycling: Crane has the facilities and capability to recycle various materials from a wide variety of ammunition and munitions. BRAC 2005 CAAA will gain the detonator, relays and delays workload from Kansas Army Ammunition Plant. It also gained the demolition charges workload from Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant. Both of these facilities were closed due to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC 2005). CAAA will also gain the ammunition demilitarization function from Sierra Army Depot which was another depot realigned by BRAC 2005.

Established in 1947 this library is one of the oldest collections of volumes, monographs, documents, and artifacts dedicated to the study of conflict and land warfare in the Canadian context. The Fort Frontenac Library assists the army's advanced officer development programs as well as its research and development communities across the country. The current Chief Librarian is Mr. David Willis.Evolution of the Fort Frontenac Library Retrieved 2011-112-19  Origins  Created in 1947, the Canadian Army Staff College (CASC) library was designed to function separately from the Royal Military College of Canada Library, with which it was initially colocated on the college grounds. The CASC library was initially designed to serve the needs of the National Defence College (NDC), while the RMC library served the needs of cadets and faculty. The CASC library was headed by Lieutenant Colonel T.F. Gelley. In 1942, when the Canadian Junior War Staff Course was transferred from England to Canada the initial CASC collection consisted of some 300 books and reports which had been brought over from England. By 1947, the collection consisted of roughly 2100 volumes, which included academic books, technical material, doctrinal and training manuals, popular military texts, and even novels. These donations came from a wide variety of sources, including the Canadian Army overseas, the YMCA, the Royal Military College of Canada, as well as individual officers and soldiers. In December 1947, the Canadian Army Staff College moved from the Royal Military College to current quarters on the grounds of Fort Frontenac. The CASC library transferred and renamed the Fort Frontenac Library. From that point, the library was designed to meet the research needs of the staff and students of both the National Defence College and the Canadian Army Staff College. The collection consists of books and reports in the fields of military science, international relations, government, politics, and economics.Origins of the Canadian Army Staff College/Fort Frontenac Library Retrieved 2011-12-19  Expansion  Between 1950 and 1994 the library was expanded and evolved significantly. Its core collection grew to include a significant holding of volumes on politics, economics, strategic studies, international relations, and military history, a reflection of its association with the internationally focused NDC courses. As well, the collection benefited from several important donations from foreign students and Canadian Army officers. Its relationship with the NDC and the army staff courses allowed for the creation of unique collection focused on land forces and land warfare studies.  Post Cold War era  The end of the Cold War saw a significant reorientation of the Canadian Forces, which affected all of its organizations including its education and training systems. Several legacy establishments were closed including the NDC, which graduated its last class in 1994. With this closure, the future of the Fort Frontenac Library became tenuous. Oversight and direction of the library initially returned to the Canadian Land Forces Command and Staff College, but in the late 1990s its supervision was again transferred to the Land Forces Doctrine and Training System. Responsibility for the library moved again in 2003, this time to the Directorate of Army Doctrine.  Afghanistan War  In light of the army's ongoing operations in Afghanistan and new orientation towards counterinsurgency, in 2006 the library received a new mandate to directly support research and development associated with ongoing army capability development. Under the supervision of the Directorate of Land Concepts and Designs (DLCD) with development and operations then overseen by Major Andrew Godefroy, the library refocused its efforts on the accession of both old and new volumes on land warfare, as well as the development of a number of special collections unique to the Canadian Army. In 2011-2012, direct oversight of the library transferred to Lieutenant Colonel Brad Boswell, with Mr. David Willis being confirmed as Chief Librarian.  New mandate  Effective 1 April 2014, oversight of the Fort Frontenac Library was transferred from the Canadian Army Land Warfare Centre to the Canadian Army Command and Staff College. Under new direction, the library continues to support both army command and staff college courses as well as broader army operational research, experimentation, and capability development.

Pupils from the Seacroft area often attend John Smeaton Academy, Wetherby High School, Boston Spa School and Garforth Community College the latter three which are served by school bus routes operated by West Yorkshire Metro.  Use in Television  The buildings were most notable for their use as 'San Quentin High', in the Yorkshire Television programmes The Beiderbecke Affair, The Beiderbecke Tapes and The Beiderbecke Connection. The shots used of the staff room and hall in the Beiderbecke Tapes were in fact that of Moor Grange County Secondary School in Ireland Wood. In the series, references were made to the fictional inner-city school being run-down in the later decades of its use. The internal buildings and school grounds were used for filming in the CITV series \\"Adam's Family Tree\\" which aired between 1997 and 1999.https://www.itvstudios.com/catalogue/229 Demolition Demolition in December 2009. The buildings were in a somewhat derelict state, built six storeys high at their tallest and set around a central courtyard.http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=20031031_9885805&DISPLAY;=FULL See image Much of the building surfaces were glazed, providing natural light throughout the corridors, which largely ran along the edge of buildings, a feature Yorkshire Television exploited for filming. Demolition began on the northern sections of the building in December 2009, following a decision by Leeds City Council that the building was unfit for purpose and uneconomic to repair.http://www.seacrofttoday.co.uk/news/East-Leeds-Family-Learning- Centre.5605839.jp No plans have as yet being put forward for the redevelopment of the site. Many prefabricated 'Cedarwood' houses in the area are abandoned and likely to be demolished in the near future raising the possibility that the site may be redeveloped as part of a wider scheme.

The series consists of nine installments to date. The series focuses on the titular Tomie Kawakami, a beautiful young girl identified by a mole under her left eye, who drives her stricken admirers to madness, often resulting in her own death. However, due to her ability of regeneration, she comes back to life to terrorize her killers. Each cell of her body has the ability to generate into a full grown independent body, causing several copies of her to be created after each of her deaths. It is unknown how many copies of Tomie exist in the films' universe although in the most recent movie, Tomie Unlimited, Tomie is shown walking through the streets of Japan, with most of the women she passes by also being Tomie. The films share no direct storyline connections, all focusing on different Tomies and their stories, except for the first installment and 2005's Tomie: Beginning. Junji Ito has expressed his support for the films, often attending premieres and even personally picking out the actress Miho Kanno for the role of Tomie in the first film and coaching her for the audition. Films Tomie (1998) The film opens with the police investigating the murder of high school girl Tomie Kawakami (Miho Kanno). They learn that in the months following the crime, nine students and one teacher have either committed suicide or gone insane. The detective (Tomoro Taguchi) assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko Izumisawa (Mami Nakamura), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three-month period around Tomie's death. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor (Kota Kusano) is rearing a peculiar baby-like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami. Soon afterwards Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally abusing Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking group selfies with her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both laugh as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire. Tsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling. Tomie: Another Face (1999) An anthology TV series consisting of three episodes was released in 1999. The series was later re- edited and released as a feature film. In the first segment, Tomie (Runa Nagai) is introduced as a high school student whose body has just been found on the street with several piles of garbage. She comes back to reunite with her former boyfriend, whose ex-girlfriend is considering starting over with as he had previously left her for Tomie. Meanwhile, a man wearing a trench coat and an eye patch is following Tomie and photographing her. The ex-girlfriend exposes Tomie's true nature on the school's rooftop to the boyfriend and in the end, Tomie is thrown from the roof. The two go to bury her in the woods in a deep grave and begin making plans to conceal their work, but as they walk to school in the morning Tomie is miraculously there to confront them. The second episode focuses on a photographer who has lost his passion for photography but regains it when he finds Tomie, this time a model/dancer of a sort at a bar. She resembles the girl from his past who gave him that passion, and proceeds to take several photos of her with her permission. The man with the eye patch is still following Tomie during the photoshoots. While Tomie is sleeping in the photographer's bed, he develops the photographs only to find that each one has two faces: Tomie's face and a ghoul's face nearby. Convinced it is not his lens, he tells Tomie this and she tells him to kill her to prove she is not a ghost. If she was a ghost, she could not die. Naturally, she does die, but when the photographer is transporting her body in his car she comes back to life and scares him out of the car. His running takes him to the place where he saw the girl from his past, and he discovers that both are Tomie when the previously dead Tomie appears behind him. He falls to his death from the cliff and the previously dead Tomie stands at his body, grinning and making a V sign while the Tomie from his past takes their picture. The final episode has Tomie as a young woman likely in her early to mid-20s, about to be proposed to by her boyfriend. She is later nearly attacked by the man with the eye patch and sends her boyfriend to kill this man in order to prove his love for her. During his showdown with the man, the boyfriend is tasered into submission and we find out the trench coat wearing man, named Oota, is a former coroner for the police department, and Tomie was one of the bodies he had to perform an autopsy on. She stabbed his eye out in the process and crawled away. Oota shows the boyfriend several other crime scene photographs; all are of Tomie, killed in various places and ways. For losing Tomie's body he was fired, and his wife left him and took their children. For ruining his life, Oota seeks a way to kill Tomie once and for all. He tells the boyfriend to call him if he also seeks a way to kill Tomie. The boyfriend later wakes up in a park, with Tomie asking him where he's been. After finding out he didn't kill Oota, Tomie throws his engagement ring on the ground and walks away. We see the boyfriend take out his knife and follow Tomie. Later, he contacts Oota and brings Tomie's body to an incinerator where Oota is waiting. Tomie's body lies in the back of his van but she is not dead - the boyfriend says he could never kill her. Oota manages to get her body into the incinerator and burns it successfully, but her ashes soon gather together and create her face in the air before Oota. She tells him she will never die and that every single one of her ashes will become a new Tomie. Tomie: Replay (2000) Tomie: Replay contains elements of the manga chapter Basement. The film begins with a six- year-old girl being rushed into a hospital ER with an unusually distended stomach. Doctors begin to operate and find a disembodied head, Tomie's head, alive and growing inside the girl's belly. The head is placed in a tank of alkaline solution in the basement of the hospital for further observation. Soon after, five of the hospital workers present during the operation mysteriously leave the hospital or disappear entirely, including hospital Director Morita. Meanwhile, a few nights later, Takeshi visits his friend Fumihito, who is recovering from some ailment in his hospital room. While visiting, Takeshi is confronted by a naked Tomie (Mai Hosho), now fully grown and escaped from the basement, who asks him to get her out of there. Takeshi takes Tomie to his apartment, and leaves Fumihito by himself, with no explanation. Later, Fumihito calls Takeshi to find out why he left. Takeshi reacts very defensively and irrationally, telling Fumihito that \\"Tomie belongs to me,\\" already under Tomie's evil and seductive influence. The next morning, Yumi, Director Morita's daughter, visits the hospital in search of her father, missing since the operation. She meets Dr. Tachibana, the only doctor present during the young girl's operation who hasn't yet left the hospital. Tachibana gives Yumi a journal recently written by her father, and soon after giving it to her he kills himself. Through the journal we learn that during the operation, Director Morita and another doctor were accidentally infected with Tomie's blood, and that through that blood Tomie is regenerating within the doctors, taking over their bodies and driving them mad. Yumi reads in her father's journal about him wanting to kill a girl named \\"Tomie\\". Later, Yumi and Fumihito meet at a party and realize they are both looking for a girl named \\"Tomie\\". They join forces to find out what happened to Yumi's father, and to Fumihito's friend. The next day, Yumi visits the family of the six- year-old girl who had had the operation. She learns that prior to that operation, the girl had received a kidney transplant from a girl named \\"Tomie\\". From this kidney, Tomie had begun to regenerate inside the girl's body. Meanwhile, Fumihito visits his friend Takeshi, who had gone mad after killing and decapitating Tomie in a fit of jealousy, then watching her come back to life, regenerating a new head. Takeshi soon after is committed to a mental hospital, and Fumihito becomes Tomie's new prey. That night Yumi has a short and strange run-in with her missing father, during which he babbles about needing to kill Tomie. The following day his dead body is discovered in the hospital basement, bloated and deformed. At his funeral Yumi receives a note from Tomie, asking to meet her that night at the hospital, seemingly for a final showdown. Yumi arrives at the hospital to find Tomie there to taunt her, and Fumihito, now under Tomie's spell, there apparently to kill her. At the last minute Fumihito decides to kill Tomie instead, chopping off her head and burning the remains. Yumi and Fumihito leave the hospital in relief. Tomie: Re-birth (2001) An artist named Hideo is painting his girlfriend Tomie (Miki Sakai), but she dismisses it as a poor painting and he kills her in a jealous rage with an art knife and his two friends Shunsuke and Takumi help him bury her. When the three friends are at a party Tomie shows up and the artist kills himself in the bathroom. Tomie latches onto Shunsuke and his mother kills Tomie and they cut her up together in an unnatural ecstasy. They then burn her head, which has already started to regenerate and has some crude limbs for locomotion. The portrait of Tomie allows for her regeneration, as her supernatural blood mixed with the pigments. Takumi's girlfriend Hitomi gets possessed by Tomie, in a rather viral fashion. In a fit of jealousy, the two Tomies try to eliminate the other. Hitomi doesn't want to become a monster, and so they decide to commit suicide. However, when at a waterfall, about to commit suicide, Tomie's head grows on the side of Hitomi's neck next to her head. They all die and then Takumi's sister comes and throws flowers into the water. A small facial mole can be seen directly beneath the sister's left eye, suggesting that, because Takumi gave her the portrait of Tomie, she was also possessed by her. Thus, the sister is the newest Tomie. Tomie: Forbidden Fruit (2002) Tomie Hashimoto (Aoi Miyazaki) is a dreamy teen who writes homo-erotic horror fiction in which she imagines herself as Ann Bathory, a vampire (borrowing from the murderous historical figure Elizabeth Bathory). Introspective and lonely, she is picked on and bullied by her classmates at school, and lives alone with her loving, but distant widower father, Kazuhiko Hashimoto. One day, while admiring an ornate, jewel encrusted cross necklace in an antiquities shop, Tomie meets a strange, beautiful girl (Nozomi Ando) with a mole under her left eye. The mysterious stranger says her name is Tomie Kawakami. The girls become fast friends (with heavy lesbian undertones), but it soon becomes clear that theirs was not a chance meeting. Tomie Kawakami has an agenda, and it involves Kazuhiko. It is revealed Kazuhiko was involved in a relationship with Tomie many years ago which resulted in her being murdered. However, Kazuhiko was still obsessed with Tomie and even named his own daughter after her. Tomie is back to terrorize his family and tries to convince Kazuhiko to murder his daughter. Kazuhiko ends up murdering and decapitating the monster Tomie, and throws her head into a nearby river. His daughter, Tomie H. discovers the talking head and nurses Tomie K. back to health as she regenerates but ends up killing her. She and her father ultimately end up freezing Tomie into a block of ice to prevent her from regenerating and coming back to life, but after hearing the frozen Tomie's pleas and cries Kazuhiko ends up breaking the block of ice and setting her free. Tomie K. then attacks Tomie H. but is defeated, which results in Kazuhiko locking his daughter into a freezer room. The morning after, Tomie H. is discovered by a worker from the ice sculpture company. Tomie Hashimoto is now shown living alone, with her father missing, albeit thankful because she believes he tried to save her from the other Tomie, which is the reason he teamed up with her and abandoned his daughter. Tomie then goes to her room and continues to write her fanfiction. She writes: \\"Ann and Mary are friends again, there'll be no issues this time. Ann will raise her to be a real friend, a friend whom she can depend on\\". Tomie then opens her desk drawer and looks at a dismembered, regenerating ear. She mutters the words \\"...a real friend\\". Tomie: Beginning (2005) This straight-to-video movie is a prequel to the rest of the series, shot on HD, and based on the first Tomie manga by Junji Ito. It deals with the chain of events that occurred right before the first film takes place. Tomie (Rio Matsumoto) shows up as a transfer student at a high school, quickly enchanting all the males, and raising the ire of the females. As is often the case in the Tomie films, she fixates on one solitary girl whom she befriends, with overt lesbian overtones. She displays all of her typical powers, and it isn't long before the murders and madness begin. In this movie we are introduced to the teacher who promises to kill her no matter how many times he has to do the \\"favor\\" as well as the eye-patch-wearing boy of the first movie in the series. Tomie: Revenge (2005) Another home-video release shot on HD, this one partly based on the Tomie manga \\"Revenge\\" by Junji Ito. This time round, Tomie is played by Anri Ban. The story revolves around a young doctor (Hisako Shirata), and an unidentified naked woman she runs down on the road one night. In her search for the wounded girl (who has a mole under her left eye) the doctor ends up in an abandoned house filled with bodies, madmen and an unconscious girl. Surely Tomie is not too far away... Tomie vs Tomie (2007) Partially based on the manga \\"The Gathering.\\" A young man with a past begins work in a factory, where he attracts the amorous attention of a mysterious woman who lurks behind the scenes. He is a relatively unique young man, perhaps a genetic one-off, in that he feels no particular attraction to Tomie. This of course intrigues Tomie, and she begins to become obsessed with him. Soon, he is caught in a vicious struggle between two rival Tomies. And neither Tomie will die. Tomie Unlimited (2011) Tsukiko Izumikawa (Moe Arai) is a member of the photography club in high school. On her way home with friend Yoshie (Aika Ota), Tsukiko runs into her older sister Tomie (Miu Nakamura) who goes to the same high school. Tomie is also with Toshio (Kensuke Owada) - a guy that Tsukiko has a secret crush on. Tsukiko is consumed with fierce jealousy over her sister, but at the same time is intoxicated with Tomie's beauty. Tsukiko keeps pressing the trigger on her camera. At that time Tomie tells her sister that she knows what she is feeling. When Tsukiko stops taking pictures, Tomie is crushed by a steel cross that falls from a building under construction, killing her in the process. One year later, Tsukiko still suffers by recurring nightmares over her sister's death. Slowly, her daily life returns to some sense of normality. On Tomie's 18th birthday, her parents and Tsukiko stand around a birthday cake in her honor. At that time someone knocks on their door. Tomie stands in the doorway with her beauty shining even more brightly. Her parents are delighted to see Tomie and welcomes her back in joyful tears. Meanwhile, Tsukiko still jealous stands there unable to believe what is transpiring. Tomie manages to get her father Masashi (Kouichi Ohori) to whip Tsukiko across the back with a steam iron cable as punishment. Tomie's behavior starts becoming increasingly bizarre and abnormal as she shows Tsukiko the scar on her neck that begins to evolve into a talking tumor. Tsukiko was fearful of Tomie's horrible appearance and she calls Tomie a \\"monster\\". Offended, Tomie decides to leave but is prevented from doing so when her father stabs and kills her into the pieces with a butcher knife. The next morning, Tsukiko witnesses her mother Kimiko (Maiko Kawakami) and Masashi dismembering Tomie's body in the bathroom. Kimiko then disposes of Tomie's head by throwing it away in the trash bin and goes to prepare Tsukiko's school lunch, accidentally dropping several chunks of Tomie's flesh and hair in it. At school, Tsukiko notices a girl who looks exactly like her dead sister walk into class. Later on, during lunch break, Tsukiko opens her lunch pack and sees several miniature Tomie heads in it. She runs off and throws the lunch pack into the trash. When her friend Yoshie goes to look for Tsukiko, she hears noises in the trash and leans over to investigate. Suddenly, the miniature Tomie heads appear and strangle Yoshie with their abnormally long tongues, killing her. Meanwhile, at home, Tomie's head rises from the trash bin and convinces her father to kill his wife and feed her to her. Back at school, Tsukiko encounters Yoshie with a tumor on her neck and runs off in panic. When Yoshie enters the Judo club's room while looking for Tsukiko, she is decapitated by the members who mistook her head for the tumor's. Her headless body comes back to life and starts chasing the Judo club members. Tsukiko then walks into Toshio stabbing Tomie's body, and a new Tomie forms out of the blood and begins kissing Toshio. Tsukiko kills Toshio and runs off into a locker room and encounters several versions of Tomie. Just as she is about to be cornered by the Tomies, she wakes up in her bed. Her parents inform her that she is an only child and that she never had a sister. Tsukiko sighs in relief, believing she just had a bad nightmare which proves to be false when her father starts eating hair and her mother's head appears to be upside down. Her mother chases her with a knife but is attacked by a carnivorous centipede made out of Tomie's heads. Tsukiko runs upstairs and encounters Toshio and Yoshie who tell her that they never liked her and were pretending to be her friends all along. She pushes them down the stairs and they are both attacked by the centipedes. Tsukiko then encounters a grotesque, freakish, giant Tomie head in her living room, and after a brief conversation the Tomie centipedes begin crawling over her. Finally, Tsukiko is shown walking out of the house, resembling Tomie. As she walks through the streets of Japan, she observes other women she passes by, many of them also being Tomie. She walks up to a man, smiling, and is then shown being murdered by him in an apartment. Lying on the floor, she looks at a mirror and Tomie's reflection asks her \\"Are you happy now, Tsukiko?\\" Future In July 2019, Alexandre Aja was announced to be developing a web television series adaptation of Tomie for Quibi, in conjunction with Sony Pictures Television and Universal Content Productions, with David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick serving as writer and executive producer, with Hiroki Shirota on board as co- producer.

As such, this changing roster of faces has allowed for a range of interpretations and subtle shading to the part, the most popular being Miho Kanno and Miki Sakai. Miho Kanno was Junji Ito's own personal choice for the role; he apparently coached her in preparing for her audition, even suggesting she wear Tomie's trademark beauty mark under her left eye.  Comparison with the source material  The films manage to recreate the atmosphere of the manga. Most of the stories occur during the dark of night for its sense of eeriness, and the films generally follow suit. Tomie's sexuality in the films is more ambiguous. In the manga, Tomie's attitude towards other women seems to range between thinly veiled hostility and outright murderous rage, while the film incarnation is known to seduce women as well as men.

He received command of the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) when the battalion was created in 1948 and led for two years in Indochina before being fatally wounded while leading his battalion during the Battle of Route Coloniale 4. Early life Pierre Segr√©tain was born in a French military family. His father was a colonel, his grandfather a division general of the French military engineers (). Pierre passed 2 years of corniche () at the lyc√©e Sainte Genevi√®ve de Versailles before integrating √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1930.  Military career   Prior WW II  Saint-Cyrien from G√©n√©ral Joseph Joffre promotion, Pierre was affected to the 35th Infantry Regiment at Belfort as platoon commander (lieutenant) then transmission officer. In May 1936, he volunteered for service in the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE at Sidi-bel-Abb√®s; the Legion. Pierre got introduced to the battle campaigns of Algeria and Morocco with the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2√®me REI in 1938 and the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6√®me REI in 1939.  World War II With the outbreak of World War II, Lieutenant Segr√©tain belonged to the Foreign Legion group of the French Levant and volunteered to fight in metropole France. It is with the 20th Colonial Infantry Regiment () at Saint-Gervais, where he received his baptism of fire. Pierre's bravery and efficiency proved exemplary in showcasing morale support for the ensemble of the troops and would bring forth his first citation. A difficult period commenced for Captain Segr√©tain, since in December 1940, he sailed to Beirut to join the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6√®me REI with whom which he fought against the British and Free French Forces in the Syria- Lebanon Campaign. Little after the allied Disembarking in North Africa in 1942, Pierre's regiment sided this time with the Allies and engaged in the Tunisia Campaign against the Afrika Korps of Rommel. At Loukanda, he led his combat company facing a superiorly numbered and better-equipped enemy. In July 1943, Pierre participated to the creation and reforming of the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (R.M.L.E) with whom, he disembarked at Provence, delivered the Franche-Comt√© and progressed till Danube. Pierre would be made knight of the order of the Legion of Honor. Indochina War 80px 1er Bataillon Etranger de Parachutiste, 1er BEP (1948-1955) In 1945, Pierre rejoined Co√´tquidan (), where, as unit Commandant, he was in charge for training transmission units. The Segr√©tain family lived 2 years of peace. After earning his French paratrooper brevet at Pau, captain Segr√©tain was assigned to the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment 1er RCP. A Legion officer formed at the evolutions of the infantry, Pierre was the first commander 1er Chef of the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion 1er BEP, created on 1 July 1948 at Khamisis, creating also the battalion insignia. Official Website of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, History of the 2e REP, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion 1er Bataillon Etranger de Parachutistes On November 1948, the battalion departed to Indochina. With Captain Pierre Jeanpierre seconding command of the 1er BEP, Segr√©tain led numerous operations in the Tonkin. During September 1950, Segr√©tain alerted command of the three strong positions of artillery while his men picked up their traces at the frontier. The 1er BEP received for mission to retake the town of Dong Kje on colonial route 4 (RC4) while assuring liaison with That Khe situated at 20 km south. While facing a superior enemy in numbers, the 1er BEP would have to make movement towards the cuvette of Coc Xa; surrounded by rocks and vegetation, the 1er BEP (I formation) delivered the first traditional Foreign Legion battlefield of the First Indochina War throughout which the entire battalion was annihilated. Battalion commander Chef de bataillon Segr√©tain commanded his unit till his last effort. Pierre died of his mortal wounds during the night of 7‚Äì8 October 1950, while the remaining survivors of the battalion were filtering across enemy lines to win back That Khe.

SEIU primarily represents workers in the public sector, healthcare industry, and property services. Today it is America's largest and fastest growing union with 2 million members, many of whom are minorities, immigrants, and women. According to SMART's website, the organization opposes consolidation of power in the hands of international union leaders, forced mergers of locals, and agreements made with employers without membership involvement. Like other internal union reform movements including Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), SMART seeks a union which represents and voices the concerns of rank-and-file members rather than the interests of international union leaders. This goal of union democracy includes meaningful membership participation in union activities ranging from local and national union elections to bargaining sessions with employers. Union democracy is also guaranteed by protections for membership dissent and organized internal opposition. SMART argues that the increased power of SEIU's international leadership vis-√†-vis local union members has limited this type of member access and activism that is essential for union democracy to thrive. Recently, constitutional changes have empowered SEIU's president and executive board to form bargaining units and negotiate contracts without local member participation. The threat of retaliatory forced mergers or trusteeship has also silenced dissent in many locals. While SMART recognizes that SEIU‚Äîlike all American unions‚Äîoperates in a legal and social context that is generally hostile, the organization argues that efforts to expand the union's power and membership should not compromise union democracy. As SMART puts it, \\"growth is critical to our success, and to rebuilding a fighting labor movement ‚Äì but not growth at all costs, and not without full participation of the members.\\" Mergers of SEIU Locals SMART members question the recent policy of merging smaller union locals into single locals with up to and over 100,000 members. Large memberships give locals power-in-numbers in contract negotiations and may eliminate the inefficiency of multiple small locals representing workers in the same industry. Nevertheless, union reformers contend that mega-locals can lead to \\"out-of-touch leadership\\" that‚Äîin the context of a larger bureaucracy‚Äîbecomes \\"unresponsive\\" to members' concerns. Union reformers have also criticized the nature of some SEIU mergers. They contend that some locals were merged without members' consent through a top-down, undemocratic process. While hearings and membership votes are held to approve mergers, SEIU's limited publicity of merger plans often results in low voter turnout. Mergers can also be implemented to limit local autonomy and dissent by absorbing dissident locals into larger ones where their voice can be drowned out. For example, SMART members contend that current plans to restructure how SEIU represents its hospital and long term care workers in California is a thinly veiled attempt to quell dissent from dissident Oakland-based local, United Healthcare West (UHW). Employer Agreements SEIU's policy of developing partnerships with its employers is a major point of contention for the internal reform movement. Unions often seek neutrality agreements with employers to preempt union busting efforts and to facilitate the card check process of winning union recognition. SEIU has significantly expanded these neutrality agreements to include concessions on the ability to strike and publicly criticize companies. Some deals have traded organizing rights in one location‚Äîoften determined by the employer‚Äîfor contract concessions to management in other bargaining units or for guarantees to delay organizing at other sites. To date, SEIU has made agreements with several U.S-based and multinational companies including, Kaiser Permanente, Tenet Healthcare, Sodexho, and the U.S unit of Compass Group PLC based in London. SMART and other critics have argued that by prohibiting strikes and public relations tactics these deals often take away the union's key tools for winning wage and benefit gains at the bargaining table. Without picket lines or the use of a public corporate campaign‚Äîwhich enlists community, religious, and political allies in an effort to pressure employers to recognize unions or make contract concessions‚Äîmethods for worker and community mobilization are often limited. In some cases, SEIU has participated in legislative lobbying efforts with or on behalf of companies as part of corporate partnerships. In Washington state, SEIU Local 775 joined Eagle Healthcare and five other nursing home companies to form \\"Washington United for Quality Nursing Home Care\\" to lobby for increased state funding for private nursing homes. These lobbying efforts could secure funds needed to help pay Local 775 members working in nursing homes. However, the 10-year agreement outlining this labor-management alliance empowers nursing home chains to unilaterally designate select homes for organizing drives (and keep others non-union) and bars strikes as well as \\"negative rhetoric\\" against management. Additionally, a portion of any state funds the alliance receives is designated for business and property tax reimbursements for the nursing home companies‚Äîcorporate tax breaks which will not be shared with Local 775 members. In 2003, forming a similar alliance with nursing homes in California, SEIU expanded its joint lobbying efforts into the arena of tort and health care reform. According to a copy of the confidential agreement establishing the \\"California Alliance\\" leaked to SF Weekly, SEIU planned to lobby on behalf of nursing home companies for increased state subsidies and limits on patient neglect or malpractice lawsuits. SEIU also promised to oppose any new safe staffing regulations or legislation. As in Washington state, the California agreement enabled SEIU locals including UHW and the United Long-Term Care Workers, Local 6434 to organize unopposed in specific nursing homes. In return, union members gave up their right to strike. \\"Template agreements\\" establishing guidelines for wages, benefits, and working conditions also preempted substantive contract negotiations. According to a subsequent 2007 assessment of the \\"California Alliance\\" written by UHW, \\" workers‚Ä¶found themselves with 'template' contracts that allowed for very little power on the shop floor with no right to strike and no clear path toward full collective bargaining rights.\\" (Upon expiration of the \\"California Alliance\\" in 2007, SEIU opted not to renew the labor-management deal.) Supporters of employer agreements argue that they are a necessary organizing innovation in the face of decreasing rates of unionization in the past few decades. During labor's hey-day during and after WWII, there was a tacit agreement of capital to participate in a formalized relationship with labor during contract negotiations. This \\"labor-capital accord\\" was facilitated by a unique context: powerful industrial unions in the economy's large manufacturing sector, concessions to unions to keep industry operating during a time of war, and a general policy of federal support for private sector collective bargaining. After WWII, the growth of an anti-union business class and the beginning of a shift to neoliberal economic policy resulted in a steady erosion of organized labor's power. By the 1970s and 1980s, a combination of forces resulted in unionism's steady decline ever since. These trends included employer anti-union offensives, weakened labor laws, the exodus of many manufacturing jobs to foreign countries, and the \\"hunker down\\" mentality of the many unions, which failed to organize new members. SEIU's leadership, including President Stern, envisions these agreements as mechanisms to preempt this anti-union offensive and take pro-active steps to organize more workers. Without employer agreements, supporters contend, organizing drives would routinely fail in the face of union-busting tactics ranging from management harassment and intimidation to firing workers for involvement in union activities. Stern argues that these \\"value-added employer relationships\\" which include \\"assisting employers in overcoming unnecessary legislative and political obstacles\\" are a needed innovation in today's globalized labor market. According to Stern and his backers, employer partnerships help achieve SEIU's primary goal of industry-wide unionization in the building services, the public sector, and the healthcare industry. Despite employer hostility and the union-growth imperative, SMART argues that a mantra of organizing by \\"any means necessary\\" has sidelined democratic participation and compromised workers ability to mobilize for wage and benefit gains. SMART Activities To voice its demands for increased union democracy, SMART members have mobilized demonstrations against local mergers and trusteeships, engaged in member outreach and awareness, and maintained a website ([www.reformseiu.org]) for communication and coordination between service employees throughout the country. SMART has also conducted workshops to assist reform-minded rank-and-file members planning to run for local union offices. In June 2008 SMART members attended SEIU's convention in Puerto Rico forming a delegation of reformers who gave speeches criticizing and questioning international union policies. Convention delegates representing SMART also proposed constitutional amendments opposing employer partnerships that limit rank-and-file participation in bargaining units. Although reform-minded delegates did not have the numbers to win passage of their proposed amendments, activism at the Puerto Rico convention has sparked further interest in and mobilization for SMART's goals. Since the convention, a growing number of labor movement progressives outside SEIU, students labor activists, and community leaders have criticized the international's policies. While SMART members continue to work for a louder voice within their union and increased participation in contract negotiations over their wages and benefits, the internal reform movement extends beyond SEIU. SMART members offer a revisionist vision of the organizing model that SEIU pioneered‚Äîa vision that couples union growth with rank-and-file empowerment. As one rank- and-filer explained, \\"at this table, there's got to be a place for a regular old worker who has worked for thirty years to grow this union.\\" Notes Category:Service Employees International Union ","title":"SEIU Member Activists for Reform Today"},{"id":"20330953","text":"Uncial 0234 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), Œµ 49 (von Soden), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament.

Built in 1893, it is one of the state's finest and least-altered 19th-century stations. It is presently operated by the Raymond Historical Society as a museum, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Raymond Railroad Depot is located in the town's village center, on the east side of Main Street between Depot Street and the former right-of-way of the Boston and Maine Railroad Portsmouth Branch, now the Rockingham Recreational Trail. It is an oblong basically rectangular single- story wood frame structure, with a hip roof extending beyond the building dimensions to provide shelter on the adjacent platform areas. The roof is supported by chamfered square posts with sawn brackets, and also has exposed rafter ends as a decorative feature. The building is finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and scallop-cut shingles. There are several projecting sections, including the ticket booth on the track side of the building, where original semaphore signaling equipment is located. The interior of the building, adapted for use as a museum, retains significant features, including original benches in the waiting area, and gates separated the baggage area from the ticketing area. Raymond was first served by a railroad in 1850, when the Portsmouth and Concord Railroad opened service. Its first station burned in 1878 and was soon rebuilt, but also burned in an 1892 fire that leveled much of the village center. The present building was built in 1893 by the Boston and Maine, which had acquired the Portsmouth and Concord. The Raymond Historical Society restored the depot building and keeps a locomotive, a boxcar, a caboose, and a work car on display nearby.

The aim of such programs is to return to the Western Liberal Arts tradition in education. Those who mount such programs consider them to be corrective of what they perceive to be an extreme disciplinary specialisation common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with the Western canon of whole primary texts deemed to be essential for a student's education. The canon includes books such as Plato's Republic and Dante's Divine Comedy. Great Books programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the scope of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. Students in these programs usually receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning. List of Great Books programs in Canada Great Books programs in Canada include: Newfoundland * Memorial University's Grenfell Campus, in Cornerbrook, has a Humanities program. Nova Scotia * The University of King's College in Halifax mounts Canada's oldest Great Books program, the first-year Foundation Year Programme, in which students spend their entire first year reading key primary texts from the Ancient Near East to the Contemporary World. * St. Francis Xavier University offers a first-year Great-Books curriculum called the Humanities Colloquium. Prince Edward Island New Brunswick * St. Thomas University in Fredericton has a Great Books program called the Great Books Program. The University also runs an interdisciplinary Great Books program exclusively for first-year students called The Aquinas Program. Quebec * The Liberal Arts College at Concordia University in Montreal offers a 3-year bachelor's degree in the Great Books. * Laval University in Quebec City offers a one-year program in Greats Books, but in French. The program is called \\"Certificat sur les oeuvres marquantes de la culture occidentale\\" Ontario * Great Books/Liberal Studies at Brock University, St. Catherine's. * The College of the Humanities at Carleton University in Ottawa offers a 4-year Bachelor of Humanities, focusing on Literature, History, Philosophy, and Political Theory. Its main focus is on Western Culture, but it has a significant Eastern component. Students regularly do a combined honours degree in Humanities and a more specialised discipline. * The Arts & Science Program at McMaster University has three mandatory, core courses in the spirit of Great Books: ** Western Civilization, roughly covering from the En√ªma Eli≈° and Book of Genesis to Renaissance thinkers ** Modern Western Civilization, roughly covering from Thomas Aquinas to contemporary thinkers like Stanley Fish ** Literature, roughly covering from Homeric epics to Christa Wolf's Cassandra * The Foundations in the Humanities Program at King's University College is a first-year Great Books program. Manitoba Saskatchewan Alberta British Columbia * Vancouver Island University in Nanaimo has offered a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major and minor in Liberal Studies since 1991. The Liberal Studies courses are interdisciplinary, seminar-based and team-taught; they deal primarily but not exclusively with the Western tradition, focus on the development of critical skills and include hands-on art and science. * University of British Columbia in Vancouver has offered the Arts One course since 1967. It is a team-taught, interdisciplinary course for first-year students that consists of a once weekly lecture, twice weekly seminar of 20 students, and once weekly tutorials of four students doing peer evaluation of each other's essays. Students read approximately a book a week, of which many would be considered \\"great books,\\" within and beyond the Western tradition.

The alarm was caused by a cooling pump that had failed and caused a Remote Power Controller to trip and cut power to some of the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Doug Wheelock performed some steps to assist ground controllers in re-powering some of the station components such as two main power buses and one Control Moment Gyroscope. After the steps had been completed Capcomm James Kelly told the crew they could go back to bed as all the work required by the crew on the ISS was complete. A short time later, another alarm sounded and awoke the crew, when the ground attempted to restart the pump module.  Docking ring  A failure in the docking ring on the Mini-Research Module 2 (MRM2) Poisk, caused a delay in the planned landing of the Soyuz TMA-18 spacecraft. Soyuz TMA-18 was originally planned to undock and land on 24 September 2010, but instead undocked less than 24 hours later on 25 September 2010. The failure is believed to be due to a faulty indication from a micro-switch on the hatch between the Soyuz and MRM2. A drive gear, which is related to the docking mechanism was also found to have two broken teeth, and is believed to be related to the problem as well.  Spacewalks  robotic workstation in the Destiny laboratory during the EVA 2 on 7 August 2010. Wheelock egresses the Quest Airlock hatch on the ISS during the EVA 3 on 11 August 2010. Three spacewalks, one in Orlan space suits and two in U.S. Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) were originally planned for Expedition 24.

She is also an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. She is an expert on the basal ganglia and the neurophysiology of habit formation, implicit learning, and her work is relevant to Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder, substance abuse and other disorders that affect the basal ganglia.  Research  For much of her career, Graybiel has focused on the physiology of the striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in the control of movement, cognition, habit formation, and decision-making. In the late 1970s, Graybiel discovered that while striatal neurons appeared to be an amorphous mass, they were in fact organized into chemical compartments, which she termed striosomes. Later research revealed links between striosomal abnormalities and neurological disorders, such as mood dysfunction in Huntington's disease and depletion of dopamine in Parkinson's disease. Graybiel's subsequent research demonstrated how modular organization of the striatum relates to cognition, learning, and habit formation. She found that neurons project from areas in the sensory and motor cortices governing the same body part and cluster together in the striatum, forming matrisomes. Graybiel went on to show that matrisomes exist for each body part and were organized into loops connecting the neocortex, a region responsible for cognition, perception and motor control, to the brain stem, a region coordinating movement. Studies of rodents and primates revealed that matrisomes were crucial to habit formation. In later work, Graybiel demonstrated, first in the striatum and later in the infralimbic cortex, that a task-bracket or ‚Äúchunking‚Äù pattern of neuronal activity emerges when a habit is formed, wherein neurons activate when a habitual task is initiated, show little activity during the task, and reactivate when the task is completed. In more recent work, Graybiel has focused on identifying specific pathways underlying aspects of behavior such as habit formation, learning and cognition, and decision-making, including being the first to analyze the effect of dopamine depletion on the activity of neurons affected by Parkinson's disease during behavioral tasks.  Career  Graybiel majored in biology and chemistry at Harvard University, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1964. After receiving an MA in biology from Tufts University in 1966, she began doctoral study in psychology and brain science at MIT under the direction of Hans-Lukas Teuber and Walle Nauta. She received her PhD in 1971 and joined the MIT faculty in 1973. In 1994, she was named the Walter A.

The Lertlak Panchanawaporn affair In 2002, Lertlak Panchanawaporn, 44-year-old street vendor won the grand prize on the show. The show's producers were impressed with her, since she had only a fourth-grade education. Finally, the truth came to light... a computer error led the player to being fed all the right answers. The cable feeding the player the answers on the computer screen was supposed to be hooked up the presenter's computer. She had noticed that the right answers were constantly highlighted on her computer screen and won the million by this way. Show's producers took the million away from her. Later she was allowed to play again and she won 25,000 baht in her second play-through. Articles about it were written in many TV stations, newspapers and websites (e.g. BBC and Deutsche Welle). There was also a chapter about it in the book Dear Valued Customer, You Are a Loser: And Over 100 Other Embarrassing and Funny Stories of Technology Gone Mad by Rick Broadhead.Dear Valued Customer, You Are a Loser: And Over 100 Other Embarrassing and Funny Stories of Technology Gone Mad, Rick Broadhead, pages 136-137, chapter Rags to RichesBBC.co.uk  Notes  Failing to answer correctly, the contestant will walk away with 50% of its last question value.

Plot In 2032, an expedition on Mars finds a buried egg that they take to the ship. The egg hatches, revealing a crystal and (presumably) a slimy creature that hides on the ship. After the astronauts decided to use the crystal on a large laser cannon, they all die when their air supply runs out. Two months later another expedition comes on board, but they end up stranded when their shuttle explodes. When they start to explore the ship (in order to repair it and survive until rescue comes), a mysterious creature starts to kill them all and takes control of the ship. Eventually, with only two crew members alive, the creature reveals itself: its name is GAR, and his crystal is an advanced alien computer. By hacking into the ship's computer Bernice, it learned the English language, the history of human evolution, and read an electronic bible. It discovers the humans are not as belligerent as it first thought - it explains that the deaths were just misunderstandings, as it believed it fought in self-defense the whole time. GAR begs for forgiveness and relinquishes control of the ship to the surviving humans. The two species manage to peacefully co-exist on board until a space anomaly occurs. GAR sorrowfully realizes that he must part ways with the humans, promising that he is grateful for their brief friendship and that he will never forget them. The film concludes with \\"Crystal of a Star,\\" sung by Stefani Christopherson. DVD release On June 24, 2003 Star Crystal was released for the first time on DVD in Widescreen by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

Launched in January 2011 to resupply the ISS, Kounotori 2 (also known as HTV-2) was the second Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle. It reentered Earth's atmosphere at around 03:09 UTC on 30 March.  Soyuz TMA-21 docking  The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 4 April 2011, carrying Expedition 27 crew members Aleksandr Samokutyayev, Andrei Borisenko and Ronald Garan. It docked with the space station on 6 April at 23:09 UTC. The docking to the Poisk module occurred as the two spacecraft were orbiting over the Andes Mountains in Chile. The hatches between Soyuz TMA-21 and the ISS were opened at 2:13 UTC on 7 April. The three Soyuz crew members were welcomed aboard for a crew greeting ceremony and a mandatory safety orientation by Expedition 27 Commander Dmitri Kondratyev and Flight Engineers Catherine Coleman and Paolo Nespoli. 50th anniversary of first spaceflight On 12 April 2011, the Expedition 27 crew recorded a special video message aboard the ISS in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first manned spaceflight, which was conducted by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961. The crew recorded their greeting in Russian, English, and Italian while wearing black Gagarin T-shirts.  Progress M-09M undocking  The Progress M-09M cargo spacecraft was undocked from the station's Pirs module at 11:41 UTC on 22 April 2011. After departing the space station, the spacecraft was used for the Radar-Progress scientific experiment to investigate a reflection feature of the plasma generated by operations of the Progress propulsion system. Upon the completion of this experiment, the spacecraft was deorbited, and reentered over the \\"spacecraft cemetery\\" in the South Pacific Ocean. Progress M-09M had been launched on a resupply mission to the ISS on 28 January 2011. It carried 2,666 kilograms (5,880 lb) of cargo to the space station, consisting of 1,444 kilograms (3,180 lb) of dry cargo, 752 kilograms (1,660 lb) of propellant, 50 kilograms (110 lb) of oxygen and 420 kilograms (930 lb) of water.  Progress M-10M docking  Flying two days autonomously after liftoff from the Baikonour Cosmodrome, the Progress M-10M cargo spacecraft arrived at the ISS on 29 April 2011, successfully docking at 14:19 UTC to the nadir port of the Pirs module, which had been vacated by Progress M-09M. The docking occurred as the two spacecraft were traveling 220 miles (354 kilometers) over western Mongolia. The linkup happened just over five hours before NASA's first launch attempt of the Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS-134 mission. The shuttle launch was scrubbed because of the failure of two heaters on one of Endeavour's auxiliary power units. Endeavour finally launched successfully on 16 May 2011. STS-134 STS-134, the second-to-the-last mission of the Space Shuttle program, was launched from Kennedy Space Center on 16 May 2011 at 12:56 UTC. Space Shuttle Endeavour docked to the ISS on 18 May at 10:14 UTC, and delivered the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer 2 (AMS-2) and an Express Logistics Carrier to the station, completing the assembly of the US Orbital Segment of the ISS. On 22 May, while Endeavour was docked, the members of Expedition 27 formally handed over command of the station to the members of Expedition 28. The following day, on 23 May, the Soyuz TMA-20 spacecraft departed from the ISS, returning Expedition 27 crew members Paolo Nespoli, Catherine Coleman and Dmitri Kondratyev to Earth.

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the East Liverpool area produced over 50% of the nation's ceramic output. Over 200 pottery factories have operated in and around East Liverpool, starting in the 1840s, when the English potter James Bennett established the area's first commercial pottery.Vivian A. Wagner, The main lobby displays a painting by Roland Schweinsburg, circa 1938, depicting the Bennett pottery. James Bennett was the elder brother of Edwin Bennett of Baltimore. The museum contains the largest public display of Lotus Ware, an award-winning fine porcelain ware produced only for a short period in the 1890s by the Knowles, Taylor, Knowles pottery of East Liverpool.Catherine S. Vodrey, Also on display are collections of early Rockingham Pottery, ironstone, , yellow ware, and Victorian majolica. Other highlights are Homer Laughlin's Fiesta dinnerware, Hall China's Donut teapot, and William Bloor's 1860s Parian Ware, along with Craven Art Pottery vases. Related displays on East Liverpool's social, political and economic history show the impact of the industry on the community and the nation. Susan Weaver is Director of the Museum of Ceramics.

The following is a list with specific verification by reliable sources of being notable concept albums.  0‚Äì9  * 2nd Chapter of Acts ‚Äì The Roar of Love  A  * Aesop Rock ‚Äì Labor Days * After Forever ‚Äì Invisible Circles * Against Me! ‚Äì Searching for a Former Clarity * Against Me! ‚Äì Transgender Dysphoria Blues * Ahab ‚Äì The Call of the Wretched Sea * Ahab ‚Äì The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" * Al Stewart ‚Äì Past, Present, and Future * Alan Parsons ‚Äì The Time Machine * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Ammonia Avenue * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Eve * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Eye in the Sky * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Gaudi * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì I Robot * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Pyramid * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Stereotomy * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Tales of Mystery and Imagination * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì The Turn of a Friendly Card * The Alan Parsons Project ‚Äì Vulture Culture * Alice in Chains ‚Äì Dirt * Alice Cooper ‚Äì School's Out * Alice Cooper ‚Äì Welcome to My Nightmare * Alice Cooper ‚Äì Alice Cooper Goes to Hell * Alice Cooper ‚Äì From the Inside * Alice Cooper ‚Äì The Last Temptation * Alice Cooper ‚Äì Along Came a Spider * Alesana ‚Äì The Emptiness * Alesana ‚Äì Confessions * Alesana ‚Äì A Place Where the Sun Is Silent * Allen Toussaint ‚Äì Southern Nights * Alter Bridge ‚Äì AB III * Amon Amarth ‚Äì Jomsviking * Ana√Øs Mitchell ‚Äì Hadestown * Ancient ‚Äì The Cainian Chronicle * Andrew Lloyd Webber - Evita * Angels and Airwaves ‚Äì We Don't Need To Whisper * Angels and Airwaves ‚Äì I-Empire * Angels and Airwaves ‚Äì Love * Angels and Airwaves ‚Äì Love: Part Two * Angels and Airwaves ‚Äì The Dream Walker * Angra ‚Äì Temple of Shadows * The Antlers ‚Äì Hospice * Aphrodites Child ‚Äì 666 * The Appleseed Cast ‚Äì Mare Vitalis * Arcade Fire ‚Äì Funeral * Arcade Fire ‚Äì Neon Bible * Arcade Fire ‚Äì The Suburbs * Arcade Fire ‚Äì Reflektor * Arcade Fire ‚Äì Everything Now * Arctic Monkeys ‚Äì Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino * Arctic Monkeys ‚Äì Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not * Armor for Sleep ‚Äì What to Do When You Are Dead * As It Is - The Great Depression * Attack Attack! ‚Äì This Means War * Avantasia ‚Äì The Metal Opera * Avantasia ‚Äì The Metal Opera Part II * Avantasia ‚Äì The Scarecrow * Avantasia ‚Äì The Mystery of Time * Avantasia ‚Äì Ghostlights * Avenged Sevenfold ‚Äì The Stage * Ayreon ‚Äì The Final Experiment * Ayreon ‚Äì Into the Electric Castle * Ayreon ‚Äì Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer * Ayreon ‚Äì Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator * Ayreon ‚Äì The Human Equation * Ayreon ‚Äì 01011001 * Ayreon ‚Äì The Theory of Everything * Ayreon ‚Äì The Source  B  *The Band - The Band *Barbra Streisand ‚Äì Wet * Bastille ‚Äì Doom Days * Bat for Lashes ‚Äì The Bride * Bathory ‚Äì Blood on Ice * The Beach Boys ‚Äì Little Deuce Coupe * The Beach Boys ‚Äì Pet Sounds * The Beach Boys ‚Äì Smile * The Beatles ‚Äì Sgt.

The screenplay by Michael Cunningham was adapted from his 1990 novel of the same name. Plot synopsis Bobby Morrow's life in suburban Cleveland has been tinged with tragedy since he was a young boy, losing first his beloved older brother to a freak accident, then his mother to illness, and finally his father. As a rebellious teenager, he meets the conservative and gawky Jonathan Glover in high school, and he becomes a regular visitor to the Glover home, where he introduces his friend and his mother Alice to marijuana and the music of Laura Nyro. Jonathan, who is slowly coming out as a homosexual, initiates Bobby into adolescent mutual masturbation during their frequent sleepovers. When Alice catches them both masturbating in a car, Jonathan, embarrassed, tells Bobby he is going to leave as soon as he finishes high school. Alice teaches Bobby how to bake, unintentionally setting him on a career path that eventually takes him to New York City, where Jonathan is sharing a colorful East Village apartment with bohemian Clare. Bobby moves in, and the three create their own household. Although Jonathan is openly gay and highly promiscuous, he is deeply committed to Clare and the two have tentatively planned to have a baby. Clare seduces and starts a relationship with Bobby, and she eventually becomes pregnant by him. Their romance occasionally is disrupted by sparks of jealousy between the two men until Jonathan, tired of being the third wheel, disappears without warning. He re- enters their lives when his father Ned dies and Bobby and Clare travel to Phoenix, Arizona for the services. The three take Ned's car back east with them, and they impulsively decide to buy a house near Woodstock, New York, where Bobby and Jonathan open and operate a cafe while Clare raises her daughter. Jonathan discovers what appears to be a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion on his groin and, although Bobby tries to convince him it's simply a bruise, others soon appear. Clare begins to feel left out, seeing the close relationship Jonathan and Bobby share. One day, she takes the baby for what ostensibly is a brief visit to her mother in Philadelphia, but Bobby and Jonathan accurately suspect she has no intention of returning and Bobby decides to care for Jonathan during his last days. On a cold winter day some months later, Bobby and Jonathan scatter Ned's ashes in the field behind their home, and Jonathan (who now visibly appears to be ill) lets Bobby know he would like his own ashes scattered in the same place, following his now inevitable early death from AIDS.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". A.O. Scott of The New York Times observed, \\"As a novelist Mr. Cunningham can carry elusive, complex emotions on the current of his lovely, intelligent prose. A screenwriter, though, is more tightly bound to conventions of chronology and perspective, and in parceling his story into discrete scenes, Mr. Cunningham has turned a delicate novel into a bland and clumsy film . . . so thoroughly decent in its intentions and so tactful in its methods that people are likely to persuade themselves that it's better than it is, which is not very good . . . The actors do what they can to import some of the texture of life into a project that is overly preoccupied with the idea of life, but the mannered self-consciousness of the script and the direction keeps flattening them into types.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"The movie exists outside our expectations for such stories. Nothing about it is conventional. The three-member household is puzzling not only to us, but to its members. We expect conflict, resolution, an ending happy or sad, but what we get is mostly life, muddling through . . . Colin Farrell is astonishing in the movie, not least because the character is such a departure from everything he has done before.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle stated, \\"What we have here . . . is a movie about a friendship and about the changing nature of families. We also have a movie about what it was like to be a child in the late 1960s, a teenager in the mid-1970s and a young adult in the early 1980s. In these aspects, the film is sensitive, sociologically accurate and emotionally true. But the picture is also the story of one character in particular, Bobby, and when it comes to Bobby, A Home at the End of the World is sappy and bogus.\\" He added, \\"Farrell is not the first actor anyone would cast as an innocent, and he seems to know that and is keen on making good. His speech is tentative but true. His eyes are darting but soulful. The effort is there, but it's a performance you end up rooting for rather than enjoying, because there's no way to just relax and watch.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"funny and heartfelt\\" and \\"a small treasure.\\" He added, \\"Farrell's astutely judged portrayal . . . is a career highlight\\" and \\"Stage director Michael Mayer (Side Man) makes a striking debut in film.\\" David Rooney of Variety called the film \\"emotionally rich drama\\" \\"driven by soulful performances.\\" He added, \\"Strong word of mouth could help elevate this touching film beyond its core audience of gay men and admirers of the book.\\"Variety review Awards and nominations The film was cited for Excellence in Filmmaking by the National Board of Review and was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film in Wide Release but lost to Kinsey. Dallas Roberts was nominated for the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor, and Colin Farrell was nominated for the Irish Film Award for Best Actor.

It transported three members of the Expedition 27 crew to the ISS, and docked at the station on April 6, 2011. TMA-21 is the 109th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, the first of which launched in 1967. The Soyuz remained attached to the space station as a lifeboat, throughout the remainder of Expedition 27 and through the end of Expedition 28, and returned to Earth on September 16, 2011. The launch of Soyuz TMA-21 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first crewed space mission, which was conducted by Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The COSPAR International ID of Soyuz TMA-21 is 2011-012A.  Crew  The Soyuz TMA-21 crew members conduct their ceremonial tour of Red Square on March 11, 2011.  Backup crew  Mission insignia In December 2010, the Head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, Anatoly Perminov approved the patch of the Soyuz TMA-21 mission. The patch was designed based on a drawing by young artist Marciel Santos Kayle, a 12-year-old from French Guiana. According to a Roscosmos news release, Marciel's sketch was chosen for the crew patch, since it depicts Gagarin and his crew vehicle Vostok. The spacecraft will fly a drawing of Gagarin, and, apart from being called Gagarin, it will also be written on the spacecraft.  Kvant-V equipment glitch  During the launch processing in March 2011, the Technical Management on Human Space System Flight Testing reported an operational glitch of the Kvant-V equipment. The Kvant-V system resides in the Instrumentation Propulsion Module ‚Äì one of the three modules that make the Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft. On March 13, Roscosmos Board held a meeting to discuss the issue and delayed the launch from March 30, 2011. The glitch was traced back to a faulty part (capacitor) in the equipment. Russian Space Agency Roscosmos established a working group with representatives from RSC-Energia and TSNIImash, the manufacturers and developers of the Soyuz systems. Proposals of the working group were considered during an additional General Designers‚Äô Review led by RSC-Energia president Vitaly Lopota. After analyzing the submitted data by the Review, Roscosmos decided to set April 4 as the new launch date. Pre-launch processing  Garan stands in front of the Soyuz booster which bears the name and likeness of Yuri Gagarin. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft on the launch pad. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft arrived at Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 9, 2011. On the same day, the RSC-Energia technicians, tested the spacecraft's Kurs system. Crew training Roscosmos' Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) hosted a two-day exam session for the prime and backup crews of Soyuz TMA-21 on March 4‚Äì5. On March 4, the prime crew of Samokutyayev, Borisenko and Garan were tested through integrated training in the ISS simulator and their backup crew of Shkaplerov, Ivanishin and Burbank were tested in the Soyuz mockup. On the next day, the crews were swapped and examined. The two groups of crews passed the exams after solving all the tasks for which they were examined. Anatoly Perminov, the head of Roscosmos hosted the traditional tea- party with Soyuz TMA-21 prime and backup crews on March 11. On March 17, cosmonauts and astronauts left GCTC for Baikonur. On March 19, Roscosmos Board gave its final approval of the crews to go through training at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Launch A Soyuz-FG rocket lifts the Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft to orbit on April 4, 2011. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft launched on schedule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome's Gagarin's Start launch pad in Kazakhstan, at 23:18:20 UTC on April 4, 2011. Souyz Commander Samokutyaev was launched from the Soyuz's center seat with flight engineer Borisenko strapped in to his left and NASA astronaut Ronald Garan on his right. The Soyuz-FG rocket followed a nominal ascent, and successfully inserted the spacecraft into orbit 8 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff. In orbit, the spacecraft deployed its two solar panels and communications antennas as planned. Samokutyayev, carried a small stuffed dog given to him by his daughter. Hanging in front of the crew, live NASA TV launch footage showed that the dog begun to float as the spacecraft soared skywards, an indication of the weightlessness of space. \\"Launch was great, and we are in orbit and we are doing great,\\" said Samokutyaev after the launch. Replying back the Moscow Mission Control said \\"This is a great anniversary flight, and have a great one\\". Docking Soyuz spacecraft docked to the Poisk Module is seen near to the center of the image. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on April 6 at 23:09 UTC. The docking to the Poisk module occurred as the two spacecraft were orbiting over the Andes Mountains in Chile. Hatches between the Soyuz TMA-21 and the ISS were opened at 2:13 UTC on April 7. The three Soyuz crew members floated into the ISS. They were welcomed aboard for a crew greeting ceremony and a mandatory safety orientation by Expedition 27 Commander Dmitry Kondratyev and Flight Engineers Catherine Coleman and Paolo Nespoli. Return to Earth The Soyuz spacecraft departs the Space Station on September 16, 2011. The Soyuz TMA-21 crew had been due to come back on September 8 but its return was delayed due to the crash of the Progress M-12M on August 24. The Soyuz TMA-21 spacecraft undocked from the International Space Station on September 16, 2011 at 00:38 UTC.After 162 days aboard, @Astro_Ron & Expedition 28 crew undocked from space station at 8:38pmET to begin their voyage home. Due to an apparent communications malfunction, voice communications from the crew were lost shortly after the deorbit burn, prompting some tense moments on the ground, but otherwise the reentry and descent went perfectly. There was no immediate explanation for the communications drop out. Soyuz Commander Aleksandr Samokutyayev and Flight Engineers Andrei Borisenko and Ronald Garan returned to Earth on September 16, 2011 at 03:59 UTC, landing on target in central Kazakhstan. Russian search and rescue teams, along with NASA flight surgeons and space station program managers, were standing by to help the Soyuz crew. Three Antonov airplanes, 14 Mil Mi-8 helicopters, and seven rescue vehicles took part in the search for the capsule. Samokutyayev was the first to be extracted out of the Soyuz descent module, followed by Garan and Borisenko. All three appeared relaxed and in good health as they rested in recliners near the descent module. After quick medical examinations inside a nearby erected tent, the crew were flown to Karaganda for an official welcome home ceremony. From there Samokutyaev and Borisenko flew to Star City near Moscow while Garan boarded a NASA jet to fly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

Call sign The crew of Soyuz TMA-21 selected Tarkhany as their call sign of respect for Mikhail Lermontov's work. Lermontov grew up in the village of Tarkhany (in the Penza Governorate), which now preserves his remains. Year 2011 also marks the 170th anniversary of his fatal duel with fellow army officer Nikolai Martynov in 1841.

He was buried in Nakhabino cemetery on November 8, 2006. Artistic style His early works, including the graduation work \\"Steel smelter\\" (1956) follow the standards of soviet realism set up by Vera Mukhina, Ivan Shadr, Sergey Merkurov. The first significant work \\"Hiroshima\\" (1957) which made Galochkin well known in the USSR is devoted to the victims of atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. \\"Hiroshima\\" expresses the sculptor's protest against nuclear weapons, a call for humanness.

Lenin\\", 1960 From 1957 till 1991 Galochkin produced dozens of state-ordered parade monuments and busts to Vladimir Lenin and other soviet leaders. However the sculptor never treated these works as art. Already as a young artist he became disillusioned with the principles of soviet realism. He studied European and American art, especially Henry Moore, Ossip Zadkine, Amedeo Modigliani. A series of monuments by Galochkin is devoted to World War II. His view of war is however very far from the one of the soviet propaganda. Having survived the war as a child, he portrays the suffering of common people instead of youthfully marching soldiers or triumphant military leaders. His work \\"Leaving for the front\\" 1957, carved from one piece of wood, shows the last passionate kiss of a soldier leaving his wife. In memorial \\"Victim\\" 1964 a shape of a human appears as a breach in solid stone, as if formed by an exploding shell. The disappeared human being has left a trace, a silhouette in the air. The memorial to the victims of Babi Yar (working title \\"Violence\\") 1964 - a pregnant woman, cut in half is a terrible symbol for the mass executions of Jews. Monument \\"Widows\\" 1975 depicts an old and a young woman (mother and wife) eternally holding the soldier's helmet.

Unfortunately most of his studies and works depicting the female body in a realistic manner did not survive to the present day. His presentation of the nude body gradually changed from a realistic to more and more a symbolic one. In works \\"Queen\\" 1965, \\"River\\" 1970, \\"Cellist\\" 1975 the figure of a woman is stylized, converted into a play of silhouettes, volumes, and \\"shapes of air\\". Valentin Galochkin develops his own concept of sculpture as a multitude of silhouettes, which are built by the air surrounding the sculpture. From different angles of view the same sculpture makes a different silhouette.

Only the passionless can have a quality of the eternal. If there is an objective concept of \\"beauty\\" and if beautiful, in this case, should remain forever beautiful, one should create in accordance with the laws of the universe. Not precocity makes a work of art timeless and great, but its naked, sincere truth and purity, so simple as the earth itself, faceup opened to people. What does this beauty of a thing consist of? Perhaps, first of all, of harmony and inner rhythm and cohesion, rationality and hidden appropriateness. For your inner world to become valuable to others, not to yourself only, it must be humane. In a piece of art there must be a mystery. Bibliography * Galochkina L.

Portrait: Alessandro Allori, Eleonora ('Dianora') di Don Garzia di Toledo di Pietro de'Medici, circa 1571. Eleonora di Garzia di Toledo or Leonor √Ålvarez de Toledo Osorio (March 1553 ‚Äì 10 July 1576), more often known as \\"Leonora\\" or \\"Dianora\\", was the daughter of Garc√≠a √Ålvarez de Toledo, 4th Marquis of Villafranca, Duke of Fernandina. Leonora was born in Florence, where she was brought up by Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Eleanor of Toledo, her aunt and namesake. Betrothed to their son Pietro at the age of 15, she blossomed under the wing of Pietro's older sister, the artistic patron Isabella, into a vivacious and witty beauty. Her marriage, like Isabella's, was not a success, and she followed her mentor's example of taking lovers. For this reason, Pietro had her brought in 1576 to the country retreat of Cafaggiolo, where he strangled her to death with a dog leash. Cosimo's successor, Francesco I, tacitly approved the murder, and Pietro was never brought to justice for it. Until recently, little was known of Leonora di Garzia di Toledo, and she was not identified as the sitter of several portraits of her. The facts of her life have emerged from the growing scholarship on Isabella de' Medici, with whom she has much in common.Langdon, 174‚Äì75. In the view of art historian Gabrielle Langdon, \\"Her story is valuable in revealing attitudes and legalities attendant on the lives and decorum of women in the early-modern Italian court\\".Langdon, 174. Biography Eleonora di Toledo, Duchess of Florence, with her son Giovanni. By Agnolo Bronzino, 1545. The duchess raised her niece and namesake, Leonora, with her own children. Early life Born at the Florentine court in March 1553, Leonora was the daughter of Garc√≠a √Ålvarez de Toledo y Osorio, Marquis of Villafranca del Bierzo and Duke of Fernandina, and Vittoria d'Ascanio Colonna. Her father and mother were staying in Florence because Garc√≠a √Ålvarez had charge of the castles of Valdichiana in the region. When Vittoria Colonna died a few months later, Leonora was left in the care of her aunt Eleonora, the Duchess of Florence. Eleonora and Cosimo raised her lovingly at the Medici court, where she remained for the rest of her life, in effect a menina‚Äîa girl groomed for a life at court, in the Spanish tradition of courtly fostering.Langdon, 175. Garc√≠a √Ålvarez went on to become the Viceroy of Catalonia (1558‚Äì64) and the Viceroy of Sicily (1564‚Äì66) on behalf of Philip II of Spain and served as Philip's commander at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. He was the son of Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo (1484‚Äì1553), the Spanish Viceroy of Naples. The family came from the grandee class of Spanish nobles, the highest in the land, which was often entrusted with viceroyal powers in Spanish and Habsburg territories; Toledo has been called \\"Christendom's wealthiest benefice\\".Langdon, 6. In 1539, Pedro Alvarez de Toledo's daughter Eleonora had been married to the duke of Florence, Cosimo I de' Medici, as part of a process of legitimising the Medici ducal title, granted only in 1532, under Habsburg auspices. She went on to bear Cosimo 11 children, including the future grand dukes Francesco and Ferdinando, as well as Pietro and Isabella. After Eleonora died in 1562, Cosimo's daughter Isabella replaced her as the first lady of Florence. She acted as a surrogate consort and also took over the supervision of Leonora's upbringing.Langdon, 147. The red-headed Leonora, who possessed a natural charm, was popular in the Medici family. At the age of five, she was reported as being a comfort to Cosimo's second daughter Lucrezia, from whom she became inseparable, when Lucrezia was apart from her husband Alfonso d'Este.Langdon, 175; Murphy, 191. Lucrezia died in 1561, leaving Isabella as Cosimo's only surviving daughter; the duke was, however, extremely fond of Leonora, and treated her as his own daughter. He was charmed by her vivacity and physical vigour‚Äîshe delighted in horsemanship and arms‚Äîthough he occasionally gently reminded her to behave with more decorum. Owing to the close family and political ties between the House of Medici and the viceroyal family of Toledo, a marriage was arranged between Leonora and Cosimo's son Pietro, with whom she had grown up and who was of a similar age. The couple were betrothed in 1568 when Leonora was 15, with the approval of Philip II of Spain. Garcia √Ålvarez de Toledo provided her with a dowry of 40,000 gold ducats. They were married at the Palazzo Vecchio in April 1571, and it was reported that Pietro had to be forced to consummate the union. On 10 February 1573, Leonora gave birth to a son, Cosimo (\\"Cosimino\\"), who was the sole male Medici heir in this generation until his death three years later, in August 1576, one month after his mother's death.Langdon, 174. See Note 19. Pietro de' Medici, the youngest and most disturbed of Cosimo I's children. Workshop of Agnolo Bronzino, 1560s. Married life For Leonora, the marriage brought both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it cemented her relationship with one of the richest families in Europe and allowed her to remain at a court where women were often granted more freedom, or at least discretion, than elsewhere; on the other hand, Pietro was the least stable of the Medici offspring, exhibiting from an early age a cruel and disturbed temperament that troubled his parents. As a result, the marriage, unlike that of Cosimo and Eleonora, was never a physical and emotional success. In this it resembled that of Isabella de' Medici, whose prot√©g√©e Leonora became,\\"Leonora saw Isabella as her role model and engaged in the same kind of intellectual activities, music and sports.\\" Murphy, 191. and Paolo Giordano I Orsini. Duke Cosimo had married his beloved daughter Isabella into the House of Orsini for political reasons, to strengthen his position on the borders of southern Tuscany. Although Isabella had two children by Paolo Giordano, she had chosen not to live at her husband's castle at Bracciano or in Rome, where he conducted his political and amorous affairs. Instead, with Cosimo's permission, she had remained in Florence, cultivating an artistic salon at her Villa Baroncelli in the south of the city, and discreetly taking lovers, notably Troilo Orsini, a cousin of her husband's. Leonora became part of Isabella's circle and renowned for her beauty and vivacity. Like Isabella, she sponsored charities and the arts, serving as the patron of the literary Accademia degli Alterati. Neglected by her husband, she also followed Isabella's example in taking lovers. Under the libertarian Cosimo, such behaviour was tolerated as long as discretion was maintained and the marriages reaped political advantages. The women's respective husbands conducted affairs of their own, leading largely separate lives. Isabella de' Medici, Leonora's mentor and confidante, with whom she shared much in common. By Alessandro Allori, early 1560s. Thus matters stood until the death of Cosimo, by then raised to the title of grand duke, in 1574. His successor, the reclusive Grand Duke Francesco, was, however, very different. Though he maintained a mistress of his own, much to the distress of his wife, Joanna of Austria, Cosimo's eldest son was a much less sociable and tolerant ruler than his father.Murphy, 49, 92, 283‚Äì84. Rather than attend court and participate in the artistic life of Florence, he preferred to pursue science, often locking himself up in his laboratory in the Casino of San Marco to carry out experiments in alchemy, poisons, and porcelain-making.Murphy, 233. Unfortunately for Isabella, her brother did not look upon her lifestyle as indulgently as Cosimo. While he continued to cultivate the advantageous relations between her husband's house and Florence, he was less willing to turn a blind eye to the behaviour of Isabella and Leonora and to the complaints of their spouses, for whom their adultery was a question of honour rather than jealousy.Murphy, 328. Eleven years younger than Isabella, Leonora was somewhat less prudent in her amorous adventures. Neither woman, however, grasped the danger posed to them by the new regime or the extremity of the plotting that began to coil against them. The castellated Villa Medici at Cafaggiolo, 25km north of Florence Death On 11 July 1576, Pietro de' Medici sent a note to his brother, Grand Duke Francesco, from the Villa Medici at Cafaggiolo, north of Florence: \\"Last night at six hours an accident occurred to my wife and she died. Therefore Your Highness be at peace and write me what I should do, and if I should come back or not.\\"Langdon, 178; Murphy, 316. The next day, Francesco wrote to his brother Ferdinando in Rome: \\"Last night, around five o'clock, a really terrible accident happened to Donna Leonora. She was found in bed, suffocated, and Don Pietro and the others were not in time to revive her\\".Murphy, 317. In fact, Leonora's death was not an accident: Pietro had murdered her in cold blood, with Francesco's connivance.Langdon, 176‚Äì8. She was 23. Six days later, in a similar manner, her best friend, Isabella de' Medici, was strangled by her husband, Paolo Giordano, and an assistant at the remote Medici villa at Cerreto Guidi.Langdon, 178; Murphy, 324‚Äì25. Francesco announced the death of his sister as an accident. On 29 July, the ambassador of the Duchy of Ferrara wrote in code to Alfonso d'Este: > I advise Your Excellency of the announcement of the death of Lady Isabella; > of which I heard as soon as I arrived in Bologna, [and] has displeased as > many as had the Lady Leonora's; both ladies were strangled, one at > Cafaggiolo and the other at Cerreto. Lady Leonora was strangled on Tuesday > night; having danced until two o'clock, and having gone to bed, she was > surprised by Lord Pietro [with] a dog leash at her throat, and after much > struggle to save herself, finally expired. And the same Lord Pietro bears > the sign, having two fingers of his hand injured by [them being] bitten by > the lady. And if he had not called for help two wretches from Romagna, who > claim to have been summoned there precisely for this purpose, he would > perhaps have fared worse. The poor lady, as far as we can understand, made a > very strong defence, as was seen by the bed, which was found all convulsed, > and by the voices which were heard by the entire household. As soon as she > died, she was placed in a coffin prepared there for this event, and taken to > Florence in a litter at six o'clock in the morning, led by those from the > villa, and accompanied with eight white tapers [carried] by six brothers and > four priests; she was interred as if she were a commoner.Quoted by Langdon, > 178. The diarist Agostino Lapini recorded that everyone knew very well that Leonora had been killed. \\"[S]he was ... beautiful, gracious, genteel, becoming, charming, affable,\\" he wrote, \\"and above all had two eyes in her head which were like two stars in their beauty\\".Quoted by Langdon, 176. Bastiano Arditi recorded that she was \\"deposited in a box, in San Lorenzo, without any other ceremonies\\".Murphy, 317. Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Anon, late 1560s. At first, Grand Duke Francesco put it about that Leonora had died of a heart attack. But the Florence grapevine knew otherwise, and the Spanish were outraged at this treatment of such a high-ranking subject of their crown. Under pressure, Francesco eventually admitted the truth. He wrote to Philip II of Spain, on whose favour his title depended: \\"Although in the letter I had told you of Donna Eleonora's accident, I have nevertheless to say to His Catholic Majesty that Lord Pietro our brother had taken her life himself because of the treason she had committed through behaviour unbecoming to a lady ... We wish that His Majesty should know the truth ... and at the first opportunity he will be sent the proceedings through which she should have known with what just reasons Lord Pietro acted\\".Quoted by Langdon, 179. The \\"proceedings\\" Francesco had in mind concerned the documented behaviour of Leonora's lover Bernardino Antinori, who had often been seen publicly with her in her coach. Francesco had imprisoned Antinori, a hero of the Battle of Lepanto and member of the prestigious Order of Saint Stephen, on Elba in June 1576, having briefly imprisoned him earlier in the year for brawling. Love letters and poems written by Antinori, extolling Leonora's beauty and charms in minute Petrarchian detail, were \\"found hidden in her foot stool\\".Murphy, 315. Antinori was strangled in his cell two days before Leonora met the same fate.Langdon, 178. There was also a political dimension to the murders, because Antinori and another associate of Leonora's, Pierino Ridolfi‚Äîaccording at least to Ridolfi's confession under torture‚Äîwere implicated in an anti- Medici vendetta led by Orazio Pucci. For this reason, Francesco convinced himself that Leonora's misdemeanours had also encompassed treason.Langdon, 176‚Äì77. Francesco's approval meant that Pietro was never brought to justice for Leonora's murder, despite the protests of her brother Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo y Colonna that her death was unacceptable.Langdon, 179. However, just over a year after the murder, Francesco exiled Pietro to the Spanish court, where he largely spent the rest of his life, visiting Florence only to beg money to pay his gambling debts. Francesco sent Pietro away \\"to see if he makes a man of this house and rises above the indolence that vainly consumes the best years of his youth\\".Langdon, 180. Pietro died in 1604, unreformed and mired in debt. Notes References Citations Sources *Langdon, Gabrielle. Medici Women: Portraits of Power, Love, and Betrayal.

That has changed in recent years, and the two primary awards given at present (which are covered in separate articles) are the AV Grand Prix for retail and internet videos and the Adult Broadcasting Awards for programs broadcast on Japanese satellite TV. This text is focused on the various earlier Japanese adult video awards given in the period 1991‚Äì2008, none of which are presently active. Some were given only infrequently and many were limited to particular studios or groups of companies. Tokyo Sports Film Awards (1991‚Äì1999) The Tokyo Sports Film Awards (Êù±‰∫¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑÊò†ÁîªÂ§ßË≥û) are sponsored by the Japanese tabloid newspaper Tokyo Sports. The award ceremonies are always held in January for movies in the previous year. The first awards were given in 1991 for the 1990 cinema year. The awards were for mainstream movies but occasionally awards were also given for adult video work. The sometimes idiosyncratic selections were made by famed filmmaker and actor Takeshi Kitano. Adult awards ended with the establishment of the Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards in 2000. 1st Tokyo Sports Awards (1991) AV Award Best Actress * Kasumi Yuka (Kasumi Yuuka) No AV Awards given 1992‚Äì1997 8th Tokyo Sports Awards (1998) AV Award Best Actress * Sena Wakana AV Award Best Actor * Taka Kato 9th Tokyo Sports Awards (1999) AV Award Best Actress * Maria Yumeno AV Award Best Actor * Ryuji Yamamoto Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards (2000‚Äì2006) The Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards („Éì„Éº„Éà„Åü„Åë„Åó„ÅÆ„Ç®„É≥„Çø„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç§„É≥„É°„É≥„ÉàË≥û) were begun by Tokyo Sports in 2000 for the 1999 entertainment year. They run in parallel with the Tokyo Sports Film Awards. Filmmaker, director and actor Takeshi Kitano is the head of the screening committee. Awards are given in the Performing Arts but from the start they have included categories for adult video work. The adult awards ceased after the 2006 presentations. 1st Takeshi Kitano Awards (2000) Star AV Actress * Mami Goto Star AV Actor * Chocoball Mukai 2nd Takeshi Kitano Awards (2001) Star AV Actress Star AV Actor * Shiratama Dango 3rd Takeshi Kitano Awards (2002) Star AV Actress * Ry≈çko Mitake Star AV Actor * Mong Mong Best AV Title * Dora Eman („Éâ„É©„Åà„Åæ„Çì) from Natural High starring Kyoka & Uta KomoriCompany & actress details from 4th Takeshi Kitano Awards (2003) Star AV Actress Star AV Actor * No Award Best AV Title * Battle Without Foreplay?

It was published in 1999. An English translation, by Chris Andrews, was published by New Directions in 2006. The book is dedicated to the author's poet friend Mario Santiago Papasquiaro (1953‚Äì1998), who died the year it was being written; as \\"Ulises Lima\\", Santiago was prominently featured in The Savage Detectives and gets a cameo in this story. Plot summary Amulet embodies in one woman's voice the melancholy and violent history of Latin America. It begins: \\"This is going to be a horror story. A story of murder, detection and horror. But it won't appear to be, for the simple reason that I am the teller. Told by me, it won't seem like that. Although, in fact, it's the story of a terrible crime.\\" The speaker is named Auxilio Lacouture,Amulet ‚Äì Roberto Bola√±o dubbed \\"the mother of Mexican poetry\\", though her own take is, \\"I could say I am the mother of all Mexican poets, but I better not\\". Tall, thin, blonde, and old enough to actually be their mother, she's a Uruguayan exile living illegally in Mexico City since the 1960s, lending a maternal hand to those in need (even her forename means \\"Help\\" in Spanish), doing odd jobs for old writers and at the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature. She becomes famous as the sole person who symbolically resists the army's 1968 invasion of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) two weeks before the now infamous Tlatelolco massacre (2 October) ‚Äì she hides in a fourth-floor lavatory cubicle \\"for thirteen days\\" from 18 to 30 September. As she tries to outlast the occupiers and grows ever hungrier, Auxilio recalls her life, her lost teeth, her beloved friends and poets, and she soon moves on to strange landscapes: ice-bound mountains, seedy bars in \\"the dark night of the soul of Mexico City\\", a terrifying chasm, and a bathroom where moonlight shines, moving slowly from tile to tile. Her recollections mostly drift from 1965 (when she arrived in Mexico) to 1976 (when Belano left Mexico), but end on an eponymous vision of the victims: \\"And although the song that I heard was about war, about the heroic deeds of a whole generation of Latin Americans led to sacrifice, I knew that above and beyond all, it was about courage and mirrors, desire and pleasure. And that song is our amulet.\\" The novel also features Bola√±o's only direct reference to the year eponymous of his novel 2666: \\"Guerrero, at that time of night, is more like a cemetery than an avenue, not a cemetery in 1974 or in 1968, or 1975, but a cemetery in the year 2666, a forgotten cemetery under the eyelid of a corpse or an unborn child, bathed in the dispassionate fluids of an eye that tried so hard to forget one particular thing that it ended up forgetting everything else.\\" Auxilio was already featured in her own 10-page chapter of Bola√±o's novel The Savage Detectives (1998), where she narrates her stay in the restroom of the besieged university. However, as Francisco Goldman has noted, Amulet \\"sings an enthralling and haunting ode to youth, life on the margins, poetry and poets, and Mexico City. Much more than a companion piece to The Savage Detectives ‚Äì it shares some of the same characters ‚Äì Amulet may be Bola√±o's most autobiographical book. Formally and verbally, it also represents some of his most innovative and thrilling writing.\\" Amulet also reuses some other characters from The Savage Detectives (mainly the author's alter-ego, Arturo Belano, and his friend Ernesto San Epifanio, but also evokes Laura J√°uregui, Felipe M√ºller, and Ulises Lima). It also features some historical people, from Ch√© Guevara to mostly writers and artists (like Le√≥n Felipe, Pedro Garfias, Rub√©n Bonifaz Nu√±o, L√≥pez Azc√°rate, and Remedios Varo).

Following the age of Imperialism, the Sino-Arab relations have been halted for several centuries, until both gained independence in the 19th and 20th century. Today, modern Sino-Arab relations are evolving into a new era, with the SACF (Sino-Arab cooperation Forum) helping the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Arab nations to establish a new partnership in an era of the growing globalization. As a result, close economic, political and military relations between the two sides have been maintained. In 2018, the relations became significantly warmer, with China and the Arab world exchanging state visits, establishing cooperation mechanism and providing support to each other. Since 1990, no Arab country has official diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (ROC), although they are diplomatically represented via the Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices.  History  Medieval Era During the Tang dynasty, when relations with Arabs were first established, the Chinese called the Arabs Â§ßÈ£ü (D√†s√≠ or Dasi). The Caliphate was called \\"Da Si Guo\\" (ta shi kuo) Â§ßÈ£üÂúã.(Original from Harvard University) Da means Great or Big and Shi means Eat or Food. The word is thought to be a transcription of Persian TƒÅzik or TƒÅzƒ´, derived from a nisba of the Arab tribe ·π¨ayyi æ. The modern term for Arab is ÈòøÊãâ‰ºØ (ƒÄlƒÅb√≥ or Alabo). The Arab Islamic Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644-656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang'an. Arab sources claim Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. The Arab Umayyad Caliphate in 715 AD desposed Ikhshid, the king the Fergana Valley, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate), and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne.*Bai, Shouyi et al. (2003). A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol.2). Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company. ., pp. 235-236 Chinese General Tang Jiahui led the Chinese to defeat the following Arab-Tibetan attack in the Battle of Aksu (717). The attack on Aksu was joined by Turgesh Khan Suluk. Both Uch Turfan and Aksu were attacked by the Turgesh, Arab, and Tibetan force on 15 August 717. Qarluqs serving under Chinese command, under Arsila Xian, a Western Turkic Qaghan serving under the Chinese Assistant Grand Protector General Tang Jiahui defeated the attack. Al- Yashkuri, the Arab commander and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated. Although the Tang Dynasty and the Abbasid Caliphate had fought at Talas, on June 11, 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang'an simultaneously with the Uyghur Khaganate envoys in order to pay tribute. A Chinese captured at Talas, Du Huan, was brought to Baghdad and toured throughout the caliphate. He observed that in Merv, Khurasan, Arabs and Persians lived in mixed concentrations. He gave an account of the Arab people in the Tongdian in 801 which he wrote when he returned to China. > Arabia [Dashi] was originally part of Persia. The men have high noses, are > dark, and bearded. The women are very fair [white] and when they go out they > veil the face. Five times daily they worship God [Tianshen]. They wear > silver girdles, with silver knives suspended. They do not drink wine, nor > use music. Their place of worship will accommodate several hundreds of > people. Every seventh day the king (Caliph) sits on high, and speaks to > those below saying, ' Those who are killed by the enemy will be born in > heaven above; those who slay the enemy will receive happiness.' Therefore > they are usually valiant fighters. Their land is sandy and stony, not fit > for cultivation; so they hunt and eat flesh. (Original from Harvard University)(Original from the University of California) > This (Kufa) is the place of their capital. Its men and women are attractive > in appearance and large in stature. Their clothing is handsome, and their > carriage and demeanor leisurely and lovely. When women go outdoors, they > always cover their faces, regardless of whether they are noble or base. They > pray to heaven five times a day. They eat meat [ even] when practicing > abstention, [for] they believe the taking of life to be meritorious. > The followers of the confession of the ‚ÄúDashi‚Äù (the Arabs) have a means to > denote the degrees of family relations, but it is degenerated and they don‚Äôt > bother about it. They don‚Äôt eat the meat of pigs, dogs, donkeys and horses, > they don‚Äôt respect neither the king of the country, neither their parents, > they don‚Äôt believe in supernatural powers, they perform sacrifice to heaven > and to no one else. According their customs every seventh day is a holiday, > on which no trade and no cash transactions are done, whereas when they drink > alcohol, they are behaving in a ridiculous and undisciplined way during the > whole day. An Arab envoy presented horses and a girdle to the Chinese in 713, but he refused to pay homage to the Emperor, said, he said \\"In my country we only bow to God never to a Prince\\". The first thing the court was going to do was to murder the envoy, however, a minister intervened, saying \\"a difference in the court etiquette of foreign countries ought not to be considered a crime.\\" A second Arab envoy performed the required rituals and paid homage to the Emperor in 726 A.D. He was gifted with a \\"purple robe and a girdle\\".(Original from Harvard University) There was a controversy between the Arab ambassadors and Uyghur Khaganate Ambassadors over who should go first into the Chinese court, they were then guided by the Master of Ceremonies into two different entrances. Three Da shi ambassadors arrived at the Tang court in 198 A.D. A war which was raging between the Arabs and Tibetans from 785-804 benefited the Chinese.(Original from Harvard University) Products were traded by sea routes between China and Arabs. According to Professor Samy S. Swayd Fatimid missionaries made their Dawah in China during the reign of al-'Aziz bi-Allah. Mercenaries In 756, over 4,000 Arab mercenaries joined the Chinese against An Lushan. After the war, they remained in China. Arab Caliph Harun al-Rashid established an alliance with China. The Abbasid caliph Abu Ja'far Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mansur (Abu Giafar) was the one who sent the mercenaries.Several embassies from the Abbaside Caliphs to the Chinese Court are recorded in the T'ang Annals, the most important of these being those of (A-bo-lo-ba) Abul Abbas, the founder of the new dynasty, that of (A-p'u-ch'a-fo) Abu Giafar, the builder of Bagdad, of whom more must be said immediately; and that of (A-lun) Harun al Raschid, best known, perhaps, in modern days through the popular work, Arabian Nights. The Abbasides or \\" Black Flags,\\" as they were commonly called, are known in Chinese history as the Heh-i Ta-shih, \\" The Black-robed Arabs.\\"Original from the University of CaliforniaOriginal from Princeton UniversityOriginal from the University of CaliforniaOriginal from the New York Public Library (Original from the University of Michigan )(Original from the University of Michigan, Library of Catalonia )(Original from the University of California )(Original from Indiana University ) Trade In Islamic times Muslims from Arabia traded with China.

Chinese Muslims were sent to Saudi Arabia and Egypt to denounce the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Fuad Muslim Library in China was named after King Fuad I of Egypt by the Chinese Muslim Ma Songting. In 1939 Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Ma Fuliang (È¶¨Ë≥¶ËâØ) were sent by the Kuomintang to the Middle eastern countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Syria to gain support for the Chinese War against Japan. Others included Wang Zengshan, Xue Wenbo, and Lin Zhongming.http://www.xzbu.com/4/view-3247116.htm The Hui Muslim Imam Da Pusheng ËææÊµ¶Áîü also toured the Middle East to confront Japanese propagandists in Arab countries and denounce their invasion to the Islamic world. He directly confronted Japanese agents in Arab countries and challenged them in public over their propaganda. He went to British India, Hejaz in Saudi Arabia and Cairo in Egypt. Egypt maintained relations until 1956, when Gamal Abdel Nasser cut off relations and established them with the communist People's Republic of China instead. Ma Bufang, who was then living in Egypt, then was ordered to move to Saudi Arabia, and became the Republic of China ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Ambassador Wang Shi-ming was a Chinese Muslim, and the Republic of China ambassador to Kuwait. The Republic of China also maintained relations with Libya, and Saudi Arabia. Ma Bufang and Family in Egypt in 1954. By the 1990s all Arab states cut off ties with the Republic of China and established ties with the People's Republic of China instead. The relations between China and the Arab League as an organization, officially started in 1956, yet it was in 1993, when the Arab League opened its first Office in China, when former Secretary general Essmat Abdel Megeed went to an official Visit to Beijing, in 1996, the Chinese president Jiang Zemin visited the Arab League headquarters during his visit in Cairo, to become the first Chinese leader to have an official visit for the Arab League.  21st century  Adam Hoffman and Roie Yellinek of the Middle East Institute wrote in May 2020 that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (coronavirus), which spread from China to the Arab states, has set a complex dynamic in relations between the sides, created an opportunity for solidarity and assistance, and at the same time exacerbating present challenges. 15 of the 22 Arab League member states had supported along with 53 countries, in June 2020, backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations.  Sino-Arab Cooperation Forum  In the opening ceremony of the Forum in 2004, Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing said that \\"the Arab world is an important force in the international arena, and that China and Arab countries enjoy a time-honored friendship.\\" \\"Similar histories, common objectives and wide-ranging shared interests have enabled the two sides to strengthen cooperation,\\" he said. \\"No matter how the international situation changes, China has always been the sincere friend of the Arab world.\\" The Sino-Arab Cooperation Forum was formally established during President Hu Jintao's visit to the League's headquarters in January 2004. Hu noted at the time that the formation of the forum was a continuation of the traditional friendship between China and the Arab world and an important move to promote bilateral ties under new circumstances. Li stated that \\"the establishment of the forum would be conducive to expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in a variety of areas.\\" \\"China has submitted four proposals. First, maintaining mutual respect, equitable treatment and sincere cooperation on the political front. Second, promoting economic and trade ties through cooperation in investment, trade, contracted projects, labor service, energy, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture, environmental protection and information. Third, expanding cultural exchanges. Finally, conducting personnel training,\\" he said. Arab foreign ministers attending the meeting agreed that the formal inauguration of the forum was a significant event in the history of Arab ties with China. They submitted a variety of proposals on promoting Sino-Arab friendship and cooperation. At the conclusion of the meeting, Li and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa signed a declaration and an action plan for the forum. Li arrived in Cairo on Sunday evening for a three-day visit to Egypt, the last leg of a Middle East tour that has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman.

CIE comes under the umbrella term autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), which include non-syndromic congenital ichthyoses such as harlequin ichthyosis and lamellar ichthyosis. Symptoms and signs Infants are often born in a collodion membrane, a shiny, wax outer layer on the skin and usually with ectropion, a condition in which the eyelids turn outwards. When the membrane is shed, the skin is red with a generalized white scale. Palms, soles and areas on the joints are often affected with hyperkeratosis, a thickening of the layer of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin forming scales. Eclabium (eversion of the lips), ectropion and alopecia (hair loss) are more common in CIE than in Lamellar ichthyosis (LI). CIE can present very similarly to LI and they often share characteristics, though the two conditions can often be differentiated by the appearance of the scales. Scales on patients with CIE are fine and white on skin with erythema while appear larger and greyer on the limbs, compared to LI where scales appear large and dark. Genetics CIE is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. This means a child must inherit a defective pair of genes (one from each parent) to show the symptoms. Parents who are carriers of the defective genes show no symptoms but their children have a 25% chance of having CIE. There are several genetic faults which can produce CIE. Known genes involved include TGM1, ALOX12B, ALOXE3, NIPAL4, ABCA12, CYP4F22, LIPN, CERS3, PNPLA1, ST14, and CASP14 Diagnosis Treatment  See also  * Ichthyosis * Lamellar ichthyosis * Collodion baby * List of cutaneous conditions  References   External links  * GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis Category:Genodermatoses Category:Rare diseases Category:Autosomal recessive disorders ","title":"Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma"},{"id":"20331841","text":"Sweet Valley Twins (also known as Sweet Valley Twins and Friends) was the first spin-off to originate from Sweet Valley High, and was created by Francine Pascal and written by Jamie Suzanne.

It was constructed between 1862 and 1863, on the east side of the A56 Chester Road. The parish functions under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. Origins The St Ann's Mission was founded in 1859 in a small chapel on Herbert Street, Stretford. It initially served as a chapel-of-ease to All Saints, Barton until 1862 after which it became chapel-of-ease to St Francis, Gorton and was served by the Franciscan Fathers. Construction The church was designed by E. W. Pugin in the Gothic Revival style for Sir Humphrey de Trafford who commissioned the church as wedding anniversary present for his wife Lady Annette. The contractor was Mr Glaistor of Liverpool, Hardman & Co. of Birmingham made the windows and brasswork and Richard Lockwood Boulton of Worcester was stonemason. The church was opened on 22 November 1863 by Bishop William Turner. View of interior The presbytery and sacristy were completed in 1865 and the church was consecrated by Bishop William Turner on 18 June 1867. The following year the church organ was installed by FW Jardine of Manchester.A History of St Ann's, Stretford, 2004 Later alterations During 1893 and 1894 the church was refurbished and redecorated. JA Pippet of Hardman & Co. of Birmingham painted a series of murals throughout the church depicting the various stages of the life of St Ann. In the 1930s, the church was modernised with new oak fittings including a pulpit, altar rails, font, and panelling on the sanctuary. Work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, during which St Ann's was damaged by incendiary bombs in the blitz. In the 1960s, the church was extensively modernised in preparation for the centenary. Then, following the Second Vatican Council, work began in the 1970s to modernise the sanctuary for the new liturgy; the high altar, pulpit and later the altar rails were all removed.

He is most noted for an autobiographical book Life in the Confederate army, being the observations and experiences of an alien in the South during the American Civil War (1888) that he wrote after the war chronicling his army life.Watson, William. Life in the Confederate army, being the observations and experiences of an alien in the South during the American Civil war. New York, Scribner & Welford, 1888. Biography William Watson was born in 1826 in the Scottish village of Skelmorlie, some twenty-five miles west of Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde. His father, a landscape gardener named Henry Watson, had been born in England. He had come to Skelmorlie in 1820 to lay out the grounds of Ashcraig, the estate of Andrew D. Campbell, a retired sugar planter. Trained as an shipbuilding engineer, Watson immigrated about 1845 to the Caribbean Islands, where he worked as a civil engineer and occasional captain of sailing vessels. Sometime about 1850 he moved to Louisiana and by 1860 was part owner of a sawmill and a coal and steamboat business in Baton Rouge. He joined the local Rifle Volunteers, and when the Civil War broke out enlisted in the Confederate Army. Other British citizens had joined up for various motivations, including financial interests as well as support for the cause. Watson was sympathetic to the Confederacy, and also conscious of social pressure on his business to contribute \\"at least one man to the service.\\" He disapproved of secession and was critical of the leadership, but felt it would have discredited both himself and his Scottish countrymen to withdraw from his commitment when war commenced. He was also aware foreigners who did not volunteer would be coerced, or be persecuted by being banished and their property confiscated. He was a sergeant in the 3rd Louisiana Infantry and served in a number of military campaigns with the regiment. His battles included Oak Hills, Pea Ridge and Beechgrove. Watson was then discharged, and became a blockade runner, initially with schooners and then as a steam vessel master.Walter Smart (1968) Skelmorlie: The Story of the Parish Consisting of Skelmorlie and Wemyss Bay. Postbellum After the war, Watson returned to Scotland and began a business in Greenock. He had three houses built in Skelmorlie, and named these houses, to commemorate his war service; Oakhill, Pea Ridge and Beechgrove. Living in Pea Ridge, he wrote Life In The Confederate Army: Being The Observations And Experiences Of An Alien In The South During The American Civil War, published in 1888.Library of Congress Online Catalog This was followed in 1892 by The Adventures Of A Blockade Runner; Or, Trade In Time Of War.

() is an Irish football club currently fielding teams in the Munster Senior League and the Cork Schoolboys League. History 1926-1935 =Founding of the Club= Mallow United F.C. was formed at a meeting held in the Central Hotel on 11 November 1926. Present at this meeting were: F.G. Ward, Bridge Street; F.J. Farelly, Bridge Street; J. O'Keeffe, Bridge Street; L. Ward, Bridge Street; S. Grogan, Main St.; W.J. Robinson and G.A. Robinson, Spa Square; C. Davis, Main St; D Burns, Ballydaheen; F. Clune, Fair Street; J. Hartnett, Spa Walk; L. Kennan, Humes Lane; G. Byrne, Bank Place; W. Sheehan, Main Street (Bakery). At this meeting the first officers were elected as follows: Chairman: F.G. Ward, Secretary: W.J. Robinson, Treasurer: G.A. Robinson, It was decided to enter a team in the Munster Junior and F.A.I. Cups. The appointment of a selection committee and team captain would be made at a later meeting. The club colours would be black and red. A club membership fee of 2/6 (12p) a year and a weekly charge of 3d to be collected on Sundays. =First Recorded Fixtures= The second meeting was held on 24 November 1926 at 119 Main St. At this meeting arrangements were made for the first match for a Mallow United team who were to play Sunnyside Rovers. The team selected for this historic fixture were: G. Robinson, J. Hartnett, W. Robinson, F. Mahony, C. Davis, D. Burns. G. Kennedy, P. McDermott, Wm Conway, F.G Ward, T. Crowley. Team captain would be F.G. Ward. Mallow United played Glenview in the FAI Junior Cup on 20 January 1927. The Mallow team was: G.A. Robinson, F. Mahony, W.J. Robinson. W. Conway, F.G. Ward (Captain) C. Davis (Vice-captain), D. Burns, G.Kennedy, J.C. Kelly, P. McDermott and J. Hartnett. Mallow's 1st round Munster Junior Cup match on 20 February 1927 was against Sunnyside Rovers with Mallow losing the game with a score of 5 goals to 2. The team line up for the game was G.A. Robinson. G. Kennedy, W.J. Robinson. F.O'Mahony, C. Davis, J. Matthews, F.G.Ward (Captain) D. Burns, J.J. McDermott, W. Conway and R. Lenihan. The three substitutes listed for the match were J.J. Hartnett, E. Hanley and A. Callaghan. By this time, the committee had appointed Major Godfrey, Dr. E. F. O' Connor and Mr. G. Kennedy as team coaches. The committee was also active in trying to secure the Fair Field as a playing pitch from Mr. W. Priestley. =Earliest League Campaigns= The earliest recorded team to take part in the Munster Junior League was the team that played Central United on Sunday 30 September 1928. The Munster Junior League was made up of the following teams: Cork Bohemians, Fordsons, Bridewell, Barracton, Cork City, Cork Celtic, G.S.R. Fermoy, Cobh Ramblers, Southern Rovers, Gratton Rangers, Springfield, Burtonville, Tramways, Dwyers, Bellville, Ardfallen, Central United, Glenview, Rockmount, and Victoria Celtic. After only one year in football the Mallow United decided to step up from Junior football and enter the Munster Senior League. This indeed was a major step for a club that was founded only the year before, but reflected the ambition of the club. The League had the following members: Barrackton United, Bohemians, Cahir Park, Cobh Ramblers, Cork Celtic, Cork City, Fermoy, Waterford Celtic, and Mallow. Mallow found the going tough from the start of the season and failed to make an impression and after one season dropped back down to Junior football where they were later to join the North Munster League. Surprisingly it would be another sixty years before the North Cork town would play senior football again when Mallow United would once again join the Munster Senior League. The league was won by Waterford Celtic with Cork Celtic as runners-up. =Windsor Park= Further evidence of the ambition of the club committee is illustrated by the decision to embark on a trip north to Belfast to play Craigavad F.C. Arrangements for the trip were made by Mr. William Girvan who worked for a manufacturing stationery company Wm Ritchie & Sons Ltd of Elder St., Edinburgh. In the course of his business trips south he would call to Robinsons Bros, Grocers, Main Street, Mallow. W.J. Robinson was Hon. Secretary of Mallow United while his brother G.A. Robinson was Hon. Treasurer. Mallow traveled north and played this historic match at Windsor Park. Coming so close to the political strife of the time, the fixture was an example of sport winning over political divisions. A return match was arranged for Easter Monday 1928 in the Town Park in Mallow. Craigavad F.C. traveled to Mallow on Easter Sunday and stayed in the Central Hotel. For the Mallow United v Craigavad match in March 1928 the team was: Sonny O'Neill, Bill Robinson, Fred Ward, Jimmy Wrixon, Chris Davis, Paddy Waters, Jack Golden, Sonny O'Riordan, George Byrne, Matt Culloty, Joe Weir.

By 1868 the church building was too small for its congregation, and a new structure was opened in 1869.. This church was used for Moravian services until 2005 when the congregation sold it and moved to its new premises in Royton. The Westwood building still stands. Buildings and interiors Church The exterior of the original chapel on Main Road before 1896. The foundation stone of the Westwood church was laid on 5 August 1865.. This building was on Main Road on the site now occupied by the Sunday School. It soon became apparent that the chapel was not big enough and building work began on a new church on Middleton Road in 1868. This was opened on 12 May 1869 and remained in use by the Moravian Church until July 2005.. The exterior of Westwood Moravian Church, viewed from Middleton Road below Neville Street, about 1887. The exterior of the 1869 church building was described in 2005: \\"The show is all to the road, where pinnacled piers frame a gabled entrance bay with round-headed arches to the door and windows. On each side bays with stairs to the galleries, with cornices and pinnacles at the angles\\". A drawing exists of the interior of the church as arranged in 1882. The organ is in an apse at the north end. The pulpit, which has access by stairs on both sides, is in a central position in front of the organ. The communion table stands in front of the pulpit. Rows of pews face the table from right, left and centre. The interior of the 1869 church as it would have appeared between 1882 and 1923. The interior was substantially remodeled in 1924. In addition to new vestries beyond the old north exterior wall for the Minister and choir, the front of the church was fitted with beautiful oak furniture. This included choir stalls to right and left; a communion table, chairs and a memorial screen for the war dead; and a new pulpit between the table and the Minister's vestry. The cost of these works was over ¬£3,000 . In 1932 a baptismal font was given to the church in memory of Br J J Lees. When Westwood closed in 2005, the communion table, memorial plaque and Lamb and Flag symbol from the pulpit were transferred to the new church in Royton along with the font. Organ In 1873 an organ was bought for the church at a cost of ¬£100. It was first used on Palm Sunday. It was replaced in 1903 with one designed by George BensonGeorge Benson (1862‚Äì1917); brief biographical details available from National Pipe Organ Register's directory of British organ builders, http://www.npor.org.uk/xnpor_search_dbob.shtml, accessed 29 December 2008 by searching for \\"Benson\\" of Manchester. This organ had great and swell manuals, pedals and two arrays of stops. It was installed by Robert Jackson,Robert Jackson (1842‚Äì1914) was organist at St Peter's Church, Oldham, from 1868 following training at the Royal Academy of Music; brief biographical details obtained from more at http://www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/j/a/jackson_r.htm on 29 December 2008 the organist of St Peter's Church in Oldham. The bellows were initially powered by a hydraulic engine working from mains water pressure (with the exhaust water being used by the nearby Neville Mill) but an electric blower was installed in 1923. The value of the Benson organ was estimated in 1965 to be ¬£3,000. It was left to be broken up on the closure of the Westwood church building. Manse The Moravian Manse or Parsonage on Middleton Road at Westwood, circa 1887. In August 1872, a Manse was built next door to the church as a residence for the Minister and his family. This was a sizeable detached house with a large hall, staircase and landing. Sunday School Following the building of the 1869 church, the original chapel on Main Road was used as a Sunday School. In 1896, this School building was lengthened and a three-storey extension added. The cost of the work was ¬£650 but the new building was able to accommodate 500 scholars.. However, on 7 April 1906, the foundation stones were laid for a new Sunday School Hall on the site of the original chapel by Bishop C E Sutcliffe among others. The architect was C T Taylor Esq ARIBA. The cost of works was ¬£1,850.. The fine Edwardian fa√ßade on Main Road is notable. Occupation and use The Moravian congregation =Church and Sunday School= Whit Sunday Parade c. 1928 Westwood Moravian Church was founded in 1865 following some initial house-based work by the Reverend Bennett Harvey (the Minister of the Fairfield Moravian Settlement in Droylsden) and the Reverend Frederic La Trobe over the previous year. The Westwood mission, carried out in what was then a new industrial district, was organised by the leaders of Salem Moravian Church in eastern Oldham, with the support of the British Provincial Board, to serve the needs of some of their members who had moved to work in Westwood. In addition, some members of the Dukinfield Moravian Church had also settled in Westwood. An excellent aerial photograph of the district, showing Westwood Mill, Anchor Mill and the densely packed terraced housing typical of the area in the late nineteenth century, can be found in Law (1999).Law (1999), p 92; the photograph includes the 1906 Moravian Sunday School on Main Road in the bottom left hand corner and must predate the demolition of the Westwood Mill which occurred circa 1937 The first public services were held in the newly built chapel on 12 November 1865. Forty adults attended in the morning and seventy in the evening. At the first anniversary service, over 150 attended in the morning and in the evening the chapel was unable to accommodate the crowd. In 1900 the Sunday School had 31 officers and teachers and 537 enrolled scholars. The average attendance was 197 in the morning and 377 in the afternoon. In 1906, the church had 173 communicants and 83 adherents. Average attendances were 120 in the morning and 200 in the evening, with 90 at Holy Communion. In 1900, the organist was the subject of complaints that organ voluntaries were too long and that he failed to notice the number of verses in hymns. There were \\"times when the organist played a solo and others when the congregation sang unaccompanied\\". Robert Jackson, who installed the 1903 organ, is noted for composing a four-voice setting for \\"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\\".Robert Jackson, 'While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks by Night - Christmas Carol - The Old Melody arranged for four voices', London, Beal, Stuttard & Co (date unknown) This tune was very popular at Westwood and was always the climax of the Christingle Service just before Christmas. The Christingle Service was broadcast from Westwood by the BBC in December 1953. Whit Sunday Parade c. 1965 To the back of the church stood the Oldham Corporation Tram Depot. In 1907 the church bought from the Corporation a strip of land between the two buildings measuring 196 square yards at a cost of ¬£61.5.0. In 1910 the congregation considered whether it might buy the Depot as well but nothing came of this. In 1912 the church committee wrote to the Tramways Manager complaining that the grinding of trams often disturbed worship. The Manager was asked to instruct drivers to go very slowly past the church and to stop ringing the bell at the terminus during service time. In 1958, the Church included 94 communicants and 15 adherents. There were also 183 children in the Sunday School with 32 teachers and officers.. With the introduction of Family Church in October 1965, attendance at morning services numbered 170. =Education and employment= From the outset, the Minister at Westwood taught children reading, writing and arithmetic in evening classes. Sunday School teachers also gave lessons at morning and afternoon sessions. The law at that time allowed children and young people to work up to twelve hours a day in mills and factories, with breaks amounting to one and a half hours for meals.. State education was not provided in England until 1870. Even then, insufficient school places meant that many children could not be taught. In 1870, there were 18,085 children of school age in Oldham of whom roughly half actually attended school. Just over 2,300 were taught in private schools. Records show that the Westwood Sunday School building was hired by day school teachers for private tuition.. The School Hall was also used as an Employment Exchange from 1922 to 1957.

They stand on the stage of the Sunday School Hall. =Social activities= Westwood Moravian Church was a centre of community life for everyone in the surrounding area and not just members of the congregation. In 1900, the associated organizations were the Band of Hope, the 7th Oldham Company of the Boys Brigade, the Women's Guild and the Men's Institute which boasted two full size billiard tables. The Boys Brigade closed in 1931 and its last Captain was Br W Dunkerley. A drama committee appears to have existed from 1897, but this society needed to be renewed following the First World War. The Westwood Glee Club was formed in 1931 but in 1934 merged with the dramatic society. The society was still very strong in the 1970s, staging pantomimes and comedies by J B Priestley. After much vexed debate, dancing was allowed from 1921. The Church and Sunday School committees decided in joint session that no more than six dances should be allowed in any one night, except for special occasions such as Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. As a result, dancing took place for the first time at the Christmas Eve Social that year. However, the Sunday School superintendent and another member of the Church Committee resigned in protest. The rules were relaxed in 1931 and dancing was allowed for up to ninety minutes at any social event. The Westwood Moravian Cricket Club was set up in 1883 and was still in existence in 1965. A recreation club for football, cricket and tennis was set up in 1922. The Girl Guides began under the leadership of Sr Emily Shaw in 1932 and the Minister, Br Edward Barker, started the Boy Scouts during the Second World War. In 1953 a Wakes Club was set up, continuing a much older tradition of voluntary saving, to help people save for holidays. There were youth clubs at Westwood from at least 1943. =Provincial Synod= In June 1939 the British Provincial Synod met in Oldham. The opening session was held at Westwood on 26 June. The Missions session on the afternoon of 28 June was also at Westwood, as were the ordination and communion services in the evenings. =Ministry= Four Westwood men went on to serve as Ministers of the Moravian Church. In 1904 Br Harry Lloyd, an employee of Platt Brothers, was accepted for training as a missionary. He eventually sailed to the West Indies. He died in Antigua in 1941. His son Ronald was Minister at Westwood from 1945 to 1954. Br Handel Hassell trained for the Moravian Ministry at Fairfield College, graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester and became Single Brethren's Labourer at the Fulneck Moravian Settlement in the West Riding of Yorkshire. On the outbreak of World War I, he joined the British Army and showed distinction by winning the Military Cross and Bar. After the war he resumed his ministry and died in 1953 when Principal of Fairfield College. Br George Harp was ordained at Westwood on 21 June 1925 by Bishop Arthur Ward. He had been a minder at the Manor Mill in Chadderton before theological education at Bristol Mission College and medical training at Livingstone College. In July 1925 he set sail to work as a missionary in Labrador. In 1947 Br Fred Linyard entered Fairfield College and graduated in arts and divinity from the Victoria University of Manchester. He then spent a year in the United States before being ordained at Westwood by Bishop G W M MacLeavy in 1953. Following service in England and the West Indies, he eventually became a member of the Provincial Board. Upon his retirement he became editor of The Moravian Messenger, the national church magazine, and was elected by Synod to the distinguished honorary position of Advocatus Fratrum in Anglia.Gubi, Paul (ed) (2009) Daily Watchwords (The Moravian Text Book with Almanac), London, The Moravian Book Room, p 19 of Almanac =Closure= The church on the corner of Middleton Road and Neville Street remained in use until 2005 when the congregation moved first to St Luke's Anglican Church in Chadderton and then to smaller premises in Royton some six miles away. This move was prompted by demographic changes in Westwood and by the increasing difficulty of maintaining the buildings there. It is curious to note that in 1881 the then Minister at Westwood, Br H Reichel, had recommended Royton to the Lancashire District Conference as a place where a new congregation might be started. =Ministers= {  {   Bennett Harvey, Jr  1864 -  F La Trobe  1865‚Äì1871 -  A Smith  1871‚Äì1875 -  F La Trobe  1875‚Äì1880 -  H Reichel  1880‚Äì1888 -  N E Sutcliffe  1888‚Äì1892 -  H F England  1892‚Äì1906 -  W Batt  1906‚Äì1910 }  {   C J Shawe  1910‚Äì1916 -  R E Pritchett  1916‚Äì1919 -  G W M MacLeavy  1919‚Äì1928 -  W A Summers  1928‚Äì1932 -  L J Britton  1932‚Äì1937 -  S C Neath  1937‚Äì1938 -  Colin Williams  1938 -  G Sach  1939 }  {   J E Barker  1939‚Äì1943 -  W Western  1943‚Äì1944 -  A E Brewer  1944 -  G Sach  1945 -  G R Lloyd  1945‚Äì1954 -  E Wilson  1954‚Äì1957 -  W Smith  1957‚Äì1958 -  F G I Packer  1958‚Äì1966 }  {   John Berry  1966‚Äì1972 -  C Daniel Crews  1972‚Äì1974 -  R G Farrar  1973‚Äì1976 -  W J H McOwat  1976‚Äì1984 -  D Dickinson  1985‚Äì1994 -  P Cooper  1995-2014 -  J Dixon  2014 -   -   } } References:..From J N Libbey's manuscript Index of ministers etc. of the Moravian Church in Great Britain and Ireland 1740‚Äì1900, transcribed and updated by Rev.

It had a 4-4-2 (Atlantic) wheel arrangement and a four-cylinder compound engine. It was developed by the firm of Hanomag in Hanover who delivered a total of 99 engines of this class. There were also some high-speed trials locomotives which were classified as S 9s, but did not belong to this particular class. These included two cab-forward 4-4-4 locomotives Altona 561 and 562. Although at the time superheated technology was widespread, the state of Prussia still wanted to have saturated steam engines delivered by Hanomag. The locomotives procured as a result had a very powerful boiler and, at 4 m2, the largest grate area of any Prussian steam locomotive. The quantity of steam generated was however more than the high- pressure cylinders could cope with. As a result, the performance of the S 9 was little better than the considerably smaller superheated locomotive, the Prussian S 6. Nevertheless, the S 9 initially formed the backbone of express train services from Berlin to Hanover. Like all German Atlantic locomotives, the S 9 quickly proved too underpowered for the increasingly heavy trains it had to haul. Two locomotives (Hannover 903 and 905) were fitted with superheated boilers in 1913 and 1914 and reclassified as S 8s. After 1919 17 locomotives had to handed over to Belgium and 4 to France. Only three of them, the two S 8s and a saturated steam engine, were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 14.0. The two S 8s were given numbers 14 001 and 14 002; the S 9 (\\"Essen 907\\") number 14 031. All three were retired by 1926. The locomotives were equipped with Prussian tenders of classes pr 2'2' T 21.5, pr 2'2' T 30 und pr 2'2' T 31.5. Belgian engines managed to outlive German engines by several years since they were only written-off in 1948. They were used on fast trains on the lines around Antwerp.

That is, unlike with paper origami, the sheets cannot bend during the folding process; they must remain flat at all times. However, there is no requirement that the structure start as a single flat sheet ‚Äì for instance shopping bags with flat bottoms are studied as part of rigid origami. Rigid origami is a part of the study of the mathematics of paper folding, and rigid origami structures can be considered as a type of mechanical linkage. Rigid origami has great practical utility. Mathematics The number of standard origami bases that can be folded using rigid origami is restricted by its rules. Rigid origami does not have to follow the Huzita‚ÄìHatori axioms, the fold lines can be calculated rather than having to be constructed from existing lines and points. When folding rigid origami flat, Kawasaki's theorem and Maekawa's theorem restrict the folding patterns that are possible, just as they do in conventional origami, but they no longer form an exact characterization: some patterns that can be folded flat in conventional origami cannot be folded flat rigidly. The Bellows theorem says that a flexible polyhedron has constant volume when flexed rigidly. The napkin folding problem asks whether it is possible to fold a square so the perimeter of the resulting flat figure is increased. That this can be solved within rigid origami was proved by A.S. Tarasov in 2004. Complexity theory Determining whether all creases of a crease pattern can be folded simultaneously as a piece of rigid origami, or whether a subset of the creases can be folded, are both NP-hard. This is true even for determining the existence of a folding motion that keeps the paper arbitrarily close to its flat state, so (unlike for other results in the hardness of folding origami crease patterns) this result does not rely on the impossibility of self-intersections of the folded paper. Applications The Miura fold is a rigid fold that has been used to pack large solar panel arrays for space satellites, which have to be folded before deployment. Robert J. Lang has applied origami to the problem of folding a space telescope. Folding paper shopping bags is a problem where the rigidity requirement means the classic solution does not work. Recreational uses Martin Gardner has popularised flexagons which are a form of rigid origami and the flexatube. Kaleidocycles are toys, usually made of paper, which give an effect similar to a kaleidoscope when convoluted.

Seiter and starring Deanna Durbin, Kay Francis, and Walter Pidgeon. Based on a story by Jane Hall, Frederick Kohner, and Ralph Block, the film is about an aspiring actress who is offered the lead in a major new play, but discovers that her mother, a more experienced actress, was hoping to get the same part. Their lives are complicated further when they both get involved with the same man. Distributed by Universal Pictures, It's a Date was remade in 1950 as Nancy Goes to Rio. Plot The movie begins with Georgia Drake (Kay Francis) performing on the stage, singing \\"Gypsy Lullaby\\"; her daughter, Pamela (Deanna Durbin), watches with her boyfriend Freddie Miller (Lewis Howard). They have come down from Maine, where they are part of a summer theater. Georgia is a renowned Broadway actress; this is closing night, and she is going to Hawaii for a rest before starting any new play. Her daughter, Pam, also has great acting skills and hopes to follow in her mother's and grandmother's footsteps. At the after-party, Pamela convinces director Sidney Simpson (Samuel S. Hinds) and writer Carl Ober (S.Z. Sakall) to come up to Maine and see the theater group. After the party ends, Pamela sings \\"Love is All\\" while she massages her mother's neck. Claudia's dresser, Sara (Cecilia Loftus), who also worked with Georgia's famous mother and is now a member of the family, accompanies her on the piano. Only the audience knows that Carl came to this country to see Claudia perform, and having seen her he believes that she is too old for the part of 20-year-old St. Anne in his new play. Sidney and Carl go to Maine and decide to try out the second act with the theater group, with Pamela in the role of St. Anne. During the performance, Pamela sings, \\"Loch Lomond.\\" Pamela's performance is a revelation, and they offer her the role of St. Anne. Pamela is very excited, and promises to work hard, but does not know she is taking over a role that her mother assumes to be hers. Sidney tells Pamela to go away someplace quiet and learn the script, and without telling him, Pamela travels to Hawaii to ask her mother to coach her. On her journey, pineapple king John Arlen (Walter Pidgeon) notices her practicing the play. He thinks that she is a troubled girl who just got jilted by her love, and sets out to distract her by posing as a stowaway, with the help of his friend, the ship's captain. Eventually they figure out the truth about each other and become friends. Pamela arrives in Honolulu, only to find that her mother is not resting, but is preparing herself rigorously to play the lead in St. Anne. Not wanting to hurt her mother, she decides to give up the role. To keep Georgia from learning the truth, she asks John to take the two of them to dinner in order to avoid an 8 p.m. phone call from Sidney. Pam ducks back to the house to take the call, and Sidney tells her that he and Ober will be there in a week. She is overheard by Sara, who promises not to tell Georgia. However, Sara does prompt Georgia to consider quitting for a season. Pamela, John and Georgia go out to many dinners and spend time together. Pamela convinces herself that she will quit acting completely and marry John. Meanwhile, John has fallen in love with Georgia. At the Governor's Luau, he tries to avoid Pamela. He knows her intentions and wants to propose to Georgia before Pamela gets the chance to propose to him. He gets Pamela to sing \\"Quando me n'vo - When I go along,\\" from \\"La boh√®me\\". After she finishes the song, while the crowd mills around her, John takes Georgia outside and proposes and she accepts. Sidney and Ober walk into the ballroom and she tells them that she will not perform St. Anne: She wants ‚Äúa few years of a real honeymoon.‚Äù She suggests that Pam play it. Pamela is angry at first, at the news of the engagement, but she was not really in love with John. Cut to the theater to the last act of St. Anne, set in a church. Pamela, dressed in her nun's habit, sings Schubert's \\"Ave Maria\\", while John and Georgia, Sara and Freddie, Sidney and a beaming Ober‚Äîwatch, entranced.

History  The EPCIP came about as a result of a consultation in 2004 by the European Council, seeking a programme to protect critical infrastructure through its 'Communication on Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Fight against Terrorism'. In December 2004 it endorsed the intention of the European Commission to propose a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) and agreed to the creation of a European Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN). In December the European Commission issued its finalised design as a directive EU COM(2006) 786; this obliged all member states to adopt the components of the EPCIP into their national statutes. Not only did it apply to main area of the European Union but also to the wider European Economic Area. EPCIP also identified National Critical Infrastructure (NCI) where its disruption would only affect a single Member State. It set the responsibility for protecting items of NCI on its owner/operators and on the relevant Member State, and encouraged each Member State to establish its own National CIP programme.

This species occurs in the Indian Ocean. The name \\"chank\\" for the shell of this species is derived from the Indian word shankha, the divine conch. The old generic name was Xancus. The Dutch used to call them chianco.  Distribution  This species is found mainly in the Indian Ocean.  Description  The shell of this species is massive, with three or four prominent columellar plicae. It is usually pure white under a heavy brown periostracum, but it can also be a pale apricot color. It can sometimes be dotted with dark brown. Shells of the lightning whelk (Sinistrofulgur sp.), a normally left-handed western Atlantic Ocean genus, are sometimes sold in imitation of the rare left-handed shells of the Turbinella species.,  Human use  Tirupati, India The shell has considerable significance in Hinduism and Buddhism. It is considered to be sacred and is one of the eight auspicious symbols. In these religious contexts, the shell is sometimes modified by having the tip of the spire cut off, so it can be blown as a ceremonial trumpet. Some shells used in this way are decorated with metal and semiprecious stones. Like most other gastropods, the shell of this species is almost always right-handed, or dextral, in its shell-coiling, but very rarely a left-handed shell is found (one in approximately 200,000 individuals). In the Hindu religious context, the very rare left-handed (sinistral) shells of this species are known as Dakshinavarti Shankh in Sanskrit or Valampurich chanku in Tamil, as opposed to the more common right-handed forms, which are known as Vamavarti. The Dakshinavarti is particularly highly valued in terms of its religious significance. In its religious context, the Dakshinavarti shankh is considered to be right-handed, because the \\"handedness\\" of the shell coiling is measured with the \\"spout\\" or siphonal canal of the shell pointing upwards. This is the opposite orientation to that which students of malacology use when assigning \\"handedness\\" to a shell.

He is a financial columnist for The New York Times and a co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box. He is also the founder and editor of DealBook, a financial news service published by The New York Times. He wrote the bestselling book Too Big to Fail and co-produced a movie adaptation of the book for HBO Films. He is also the co-creator for the Showtime series Billions. Early life and education Sorkin was born in New York, the son of Joan Ross Sorkin, a playwright, and Laurence T. Sorkin, a partner at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel. His family is Jewish. Sorkin graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1995 and earned a Bachelor of Science from Cornell University in communications in 1999 where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He is not related to writer Aaron Sorkin or defense lawyer Ira Lee Sorkin.  Career   Journalist  Sorkin first joined The New York Times as a student intern during his senior year in high school. He also worked for the paper while he was in college, publishing 71 articles before he graduated. He began by writing media and technology articles while assisting the advertising columnist, Stuart Elliott. Sorkin spent the summer of 1996 working for Businessweek, before returning to The New York Times. He moved to London for part of 1998. While there, he wrote about European business and technology for The New York Times and then returned to Cornell to complete his studies. At Cornell, he was vice president of the Sigma Pi fraternity. = Mergers and acquisitions reporter = Sorkin joined The New York Times full-time in 1999 as the newspaper's European mergers and acquisitions reporter, and was based in London. In 2000, Sorkin became the paper's chief mergers and acquisitions reporter, based in New York, a position he still holds. In 2001, Sorkin founded \\"DealBook,\\" an online daily financial report published by the Times. As Editor-at-Large of \\"DealBook,\\" Sorkin writes a weekly column of the same name. Sorkin is also an assistant editor of business and finance news for the paper. Sorkin has broken news of major mergers and acquisitions, including Chase's acquisition of J.P. Morgan and Hewlett-Packard's acquisition of Compaq. He also led The New York Times' coverage of the largest takeover in history, Vodafone's $183 billion hostile bid for Mannesmann. Additionally, he broke the news of IBM's sale of its PC business to Lenovo, Boston Scientific's $25 billion acquisition of Guidant and Symantec's $13 billion deal for Veritas Software, and reported on News Corp.'s acquisition of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal. Sorkin has reported on the Wall Street financial crisis, including the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and the government bailout of other major investment banks and AIG. He has also written about the troubled American auto industry. In 2007, Sorkin was one of the first journalists to identify and criticize a tax loophole for private equity firms and hedge funds. He first wrote about the topic in a column in March 2007, calling the tax treatment a \\"charade\\", and later wrote about it on the front page of The New York Times. He has written at least a half dozen articles critiquing the tax practice by private equity firms and advocated for the government to end the loophole. In 2014, Sorkin wrote a series of columns criticizing American corporations for trying to lower their US tax bill by merging with smaller foreign companies in a transaction known as an \\"inversion\\". He also criticized the Wall Street banks that advised US companies to pursue such deals, describing the banks as \\"corporate co- conspirators\\". Sorkin called on the government to end the practice. On September 22, 2014, the Obama Administration changed the tax laws to make it more difficult for US companies to merge to avoid taxes. On the PRISM surveillance program and Edward Snowden situation, Sorkin said, \\"I would arrest him and now I'd almost arrest Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who seems to be out there, he wants to help him get to Ecuador.\\"Greenwald: Beltway media types are 'courtiers to power', Washington Post, By Erik Wemple, Published: June 24, 2013, retrieved from washingtonpost.com on June 24, 2013 The next day, Sorkin apologized for the comment; Greenwald accepted, tweeting \\"Thank you: accepted & appreciated\\". Reviewing his record after his anti-Greenwald outburst, Matt Taibbi described Sorkin as \\"a shameless, ball-gargling prostitute for Wall Street\\". DealBook In October 2001, while a journalist at The New York Times, Sorkin started DealBook, a newsletter about deal-making and Wall Street. DealBook was one of the first financial news aggregation services on the Internet. In March 2006, Sorkin introduced a companion website published on The New York Times, with updated news and original analysis throughout the day.

There is 1 case per million population. The condition is three times more common in males than in females. Presentation 3D CT image of Trevor's disease of the ankle and talus. This disorder is rare, and is characterised by an asymmetrical limb deformity due to localized overgrowth of cartilage, histologically resembling osteochondroma. It is believed to affect the limb bud in early fetal life. The condition occurs mostly in the ankle or knee region and it is always confined to a single limb. This usually involves only the lower extremities and on medial side of the epiphysis. It is named after researcher David Trevor. www.whonamedit.com Diagnosis Differential diagnosis Trevor disease can often mimic posttraumatic osseous fragments, synovial chondromatosis, ostechondroma, or anterior spur of ankle. It is not possible to distinguish DEH from osteochondroma on the basis of histopathology alone. Special molecular tests of the genes EXT1, EXT2 are used for the analysis of genetic expressions. These are within normal ranges in DEH, while they are lower in ostechondroma (owing to a mutation). These tests are expensive and the diagnosis is often made on clinical and radiological findings. Synovial chondromatosis occurs in a much older age group and can be ruled out on this basis. Treatment Most reported cases of DEH in the literature have been treated surgically, usually with excision of the mass, as well as by the correction of any deformity, while preserving the integrity of the affected joint as much as possible. History Trevor disease was first described by the French surgeon Albert Mouchet and J. Belot in 1926. In 1956, the name \\"dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica\\" was proposed by Fairbank. The usual symptoms are the appearance of an osseous protuberance, on one side of the knee, ankle or foot joint which gradually increases Radiologically, the condition shows a nonuniformity of growth and multiple unconnected ossification centers around the epiphyses.

When he was orphaned in his early teens (his West Indian immigrant parents died within a year of each other), he went to live with and was raised by an aunt. He attended Morris High School in the Bronx, and starred on the school track team. Because of his track skill he was offered a number of collegiate athletic scholarships, and accepted one from Manhattan College. He was the first in his family to go to college, and graduated with honors in 1952 with a Bachelor of science degree. After graduation, Lucas spent several years as a teacher and welfare case worker in New York City. In 1953 he joined the New York Police Department, where he remained for nine years, often working undercover in Harlem. From his experiences with the city legal system he decided to become a lawyer, and attended Fordham University at night. He received his law degree in 1962, and at the graduation ceremony, he was an escort for the speaker, Robert Kennedy, who offered him a job in the Justice Department. Lucas accepted and spent two years as an investigator in the civil rights division. He then joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a special agent, stationed first in Cincinnati, and later in Detroit. He left the Bureau in 1967 to become Wayne County undersheriff, and two years later was appointed Wayne County sheriff when Roman Gribbs vacated the position after winning election as mayor of Detroit. Lucas was elected Wayne County sheriff in his own right in 1970 and reelected twice thereafter, serving in that capacity for thirteen years. In 1982, he ran successfully for the newly created office of Wayne County Executive. He served for four years as the chief executive officer of the third largest county in the United States. Explaining that he was dismayed by the influence of special interests in the Democratic party, Lucas switched political affiliation to the Republican party in May 1985. He won the Republican gubernatorial primary in 1986, only the second black in the history of the country to win a major party nomination for governor. He ran on a platform that stressed the historic nature of his candidacy, fiscal responsibility, and law and order, but lost by a large margin in the general election to the incumbent, Democratic Governor James Blanchard. Lucas made an unsuccessful run for Wayne County Sheriff in 2004.

Vaughn and Favreau star with Jason Bateman, Faizon Love, Kristin Davis, Malin √Ökerman, Kristen Bell, and Jean Reno. It was released on October 9, 2009, in the United States. The film was shot mostly on the French Polynesian island of Bora Bora.  Plot  Dave, a dealer for Guitar Hero, and Ronnie, a stay-at-home mom, are a typical couple raising two young children in the suburbs of Chicago. They experience various stresses including redecorating their house and raising their kids. Joey and Lucy are high school sweethearts with a smart but naive teenage daughter named Lacey. Their relationship is on the rocks and they are even considering a divorce once Lacey goes off to college. Jason and Cynthia are a neurotic couple who've experienced multiple failed attempts to conceive, and Shane, recently divorced from his wife, has a much younger twenty-year-old girlfriend, Trudy. At Dave's son's birthday party, Jason and Cynthia, using a PowerPoint presentation, announce their troubled marriage and they are considering divorce because they cannot have a baby. As a last-ditch effort, they have found a couples therapy resort named Eden. A deal called the Pelican Package is half the normal cost if they can get three other couples to join them. In their presentation, they show beautiful pictures of sunlit beaches and beautiful locations. They also assure the others that the couples therapy is purely optional. Dave and Ronnie discuss their inability to go because of childcare responsibilities and decline the trip. In the middle of the night, their home security alarm is activated when Jason shows up unexpectedly to further sell the idea of the retreat. The commotion wakes the kids, who have overheard their parents' conversations of not being able to go because of them. Fearing that their parents are contemplating divorce, the kids have already arranged for Dave's father, Grandpa Jim-Jim to babysit so their parents can go to Eden. The retreat proves to be divided into Eden West and Eden East. West is for couples and uses the tagline \\"Stay Together\\". East is for singles and uses the tagline \\"Come Together\\". East and West attendees are not allowed to intermingle. Upon arrival at Eden West, the four couples are shown their villas. At dinner, resort host Sctanley informs them that couples therapy, which starts at 6 a.m., is actually mandatory. If any couple fails to attend, it will be taken as an indication that they want to leave, and a refund for Eden will be given, although not for their airfare. The group debates what to do. After an indulgent dinner with many delicacies, they decide to put up with \\"a couple of hours\\" of therapy in order to enjoy the other amenities of the resort. In the morning, each couple meets with an assigned therapist. All four couples learn that they have problems, even Ronnie and Dave, who thought they were fine. They endure resort owner Marcel's unusual methods, including swimming with and feeding lemon sharks and yoga sessions with amorous instructor Salvadore. On the fourth night, Trudy escapes to Eden East. The other seven, encouraged by Joey who is unsatisfied with his marriage, leave to find her. Following an argument between Cynthia and Jason, the men and women split up. As they try to find their way to the resort, the men end up arguing and pointing out each other's marriage mistakes. The women run into Salvadore who takes them to Eden East. The men come across the staff lounge where they find Sctanley playing Guitar Hero. He threatens to report them to Marcel, but Dave challenges him to the game (without telling Sctanley that he is involved in the game's production). Sctanley, after having lost the wager, directs them to Eden East, even though he knows he was tricked by Dave. When they arrive, Dave realizes what a good thing he has with Ronnie. He goes with her to be alone at a waterfall. Joey finds Lucy with Salvadore and knocks him out, reuniting with his wife. Cynthia and Jason share drinks and end up becoming intimate. Shane runs into his ex-wife, who admits she still loves him. Shane tells Trudy to remain in Eden East and enjoy being single, then leaves with his ex-wife. All four couples return to Eden West. Marcel, seeing that the couples have worked out their problems, frees them from the therapy and allows them to go jet skiing, and with that, really enjoy the rest of their vacation.  Cast  * Vince Vaughn and Malin √Ökerman as Dave and Ronnie (last name not revealed), a typical suburban couple with two children. Their marriage seems fine, but each of them realize that Dave tends to undermine Ronnie by crossing emotional boundaries and blocking her needs due to his exhausting work. At the conclusion of their therapy, Marcel grants them the ass as their animal spirit because they are both stubborn, and they bear the burden of not only their troubles but also those of others. * Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis as Joey and Lucy Tanzini, high school sweethearts that have fallen apart due to their belief that they \\"missed out\\" on living after high school, having been married and becoming parents immediately after and are contemplating getting a divorce as soon as their daughter goes off to college. They have a daughter named Lacey who is a smart but somewhat rebellious teen. After reuniting in therapy, Marcel gives them a wolf spirit token as they are pack animals but their hearts always lie with their destined mate. * Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell as Jason and Cynthia Smith, a troubled couple whose idea it was to go to Eden with their friends. Their issues stem from a lack of communication complicated with Jason's more controlling methods and their trouble with conceiving a baby. They are a very organized couple and are the most interested in repairing their relationship. Marcel grants them a rabbit token after they reunite, due to their innate ability to overcome any obstacles that stand in their way. * Faizon Love and Kali Hawk as Shane and Trudy, a completely polar opposite couple. Trudy and Shane soon tire of each other due to their differences in age and interests. Trudy goes off to the local single scene, and while attempting to find her and bring her back, Shane and his wife Jennifer reconcile instead. They are given the token of the honeybee to symbolize that while they may visit other flowers from time to time, nothing is as sweet as returning to their hive. * Jean Reno as Marcel, the lead therapist, founder and operator of the resort * Peter Serafinowicz as Sctanley (pronounced Stanley, with a silent \\"c\\"), the English manager of the resort who oversees the couples' stay and was the original scoring champion of Guitar Hero on the island. (Vaughn‚Äôs DVD commentary explains the silent \\"c\\" as simple fun) * Tasha Smith as Jennifer, ex-wife of Shane * Jonna Walsh as Lacey Tanzini * Ken Jeong as the therapist of Jason and Cynthia * Amy Hill as the therapist of Shane and Trudy * John Michael Higgins as the therapist of Dave and Ronnie * Carlos Ponce as Salvadore, the yoga instructor * Temuera Morrison as Briggs, the native assistant to Marcel - his name is misspelt as Temeura in the opening credits * Karen David as Spa Attendant Vince Vaughn's real-life father, Vernon Vaughn, plays his on-screen father.  Production   Filming locations  The primary location for filming was at the St. Regis Bora Bora Resort, Bora Bora in French Polynesia.Can be seen from film credits and the official St. Regis Bora Bora website. Other filming locations include Los Angeles, Universal Studios and O'Hare International Airport.  Marketing  Universal Pictures was criticized for removing actors Faizon Love and Kali Hawk from the international posters for the film, showing only six rather than the eight cast members used for the U.S. promotional materials. The studio said it regretted causing offense and has abandoned plans to use the revised poster in other countries. Universal Pictures partnered with various groups for financial support to help market the film. Sponsors include the Tourism Board of Tahiti where the film was made, the manufacturers of Bud Light and Captain Morgan's Rum, Bloomingdale's department store, and Crunch Gyms. The video game Guitar Hero is also prominently featured in the film.  Reception   Box office  The film was a box office success, ranking first for its opening weekend grossing $34,286,740 and becoming Vince Vaughn's highest box office success since 2006's The Break-Up. The film grossed $109.2 million domestically and $58.8 million in other markets for a worldwide total of $171 million.  Critical reviews Couples Retreat received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 10% based on 163 reviews with an average rating of 3.77/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Despite a talented cast and some reliably pleasant interplay between Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, Couples Retreat leaves viewers stranded in an arid, mirthless comedy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 23 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars. He criticized the formulaic story and lack of character specifics, but says \\"Vaughn's well-timed and smart dialogue\\" is one of the better parts of the film. James Berardinelli wrote: \\"Despite being mediocre and largely forgettable, Couples Retreat is not unpleasant, although it's easier to recommend it for home viewing than for a trip to a theater.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety magazine wrote: \\"Film has some bright ideas and an appealing cast that only fly so high due to pedestrian execution.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today described it as \\"Tedious, unromantic, sophomoric and only sporadically funny.\\" Litigation A former model Irina Krupnik, filed a $10 million misappropriation-of-likeness invasion-of-privacy lawsuit, naming several defendants including the producers of Couples Retreat arising from a purported masturbation scene in which actor Jon Favreau uses a photo of her. Manhattan Supreme Court Judge O. Peter Sherwood ruled against Krupnik, and she received nothing.

It was purchased in 1902 by the town's most famous son, Andrew Carnegie, and given to the people of Dunfermline in a ceremony the following year. Its lands include the historically significant and topologically rugged glen which interrupts the centre of Dunfermline and, accordingly, part of the intention of the purchase was to carry out civic development of the area in a way which also respected its heritage. The project notably attracted the attention of the urban planner and educationalist, Patrick Geddes. The glen is an area of topographical and historical significance to Dunfermline as the original site of Malcolm's Tower, the probable remains of which can be identified today on a strongly defendable outcrop of rock. To the eastern side of the park is Dunfermline Palace with Dunfermline Abbey and to the west it overlooks the village of Crossford.  History  The lands of the modern park were previously known as Pittencrieff Estate.Hendrie Old Dunfermline p.24. In 1902, Andrew Carnegie purchased both Pittencrieff House and Estate from its then-owner, Colonel James Maitland Hunt, ultimately with the intention of giving these to the people of Dunfermline. The official donation ceremony occurred the following year, and a trust fund in honour of the benefactory, known as Dunfermline Carnegie Trust, was founded for the general maintenance of the glen.McEwan Dunfermline:The Post War Years p. 18. As part of the donation of the estate, the Dunfermline Carnegie Trust invited proposals for the development of the area as a civic space. Two entries were submitted in 1903‚Äì04, one of which was by the world-renowned urban planner, naturalist and educationalist Patrick Geddes (1854‚Äì1932). His thinking about the commission, as he saw it, to balance preservation of heritage with regeneration, was an important influence in the formation of his ideas in town planning and civic renaissance.Patrick Geddes, Towards Civic Renascence Geddes's thinking on the proposal helped lay the foundation for ideas expressed in his influential work Cities in Evolution, 1915. The second entry was by the landscape designer, Thomas Mawson.Towards Civic Renascence ibid. Although neither scheme was adopted, both influenced subsequent work on the establishment of the park as it exists today. Pittencrieff House in 2011 More architectural features of the park, such as the huge ornate entrance gates, are by Robert Lorimer and were built in 1908.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer  Pittencrieff House Museum  In the subsequent development of the modern park, Pittencrieff House was designed as a centre piece.Pride Kingdom of Fife pp.12‚Äì13. The house was originally built in the 15th century by the Wemyss family. Sir Alexander Clerk of Stenton bought the house and its huge estate in 1610.http://www.royaldunfermline.com/Resources/PITTENCRIEFF_HISTORY.pdf His eldest son styled himself as Alexander Clerk of Pittencrieff and extended the simple laird's house with two stories and an attic around 1635.Gifford The Buildings of Scotland: Fife pp. 192‚Äì193 Two of the bedrooms were converted to create two long galleries for museum and art exhibition space in a restoration programme undertaken by Sir Robert Lorimar between 1911 and 1913. The house itself served as the Pittencrieff House Museum, with exhibits about the formation of the park and its natural history, including dinosaurs, fossils and wildlife. It closed to the public after the Dunfermline Carnegie Library expanded its exhibition space.  Park features  On the northern boundary of the park lies the prominent statue of Andrew Carnegie which was built in 1914 and a dovecot, in the style of a round tower from around 1700. The main gates to the park known as the Louise Carnegie Gates which opened in 1928 are located to the north-east. In September 2011 a memorial bench to the rock musician Stuart Adamson who grew up in the Dunfermline area and who died in 2001 was unveiled at the park. It was paid for by fans and is inscribed with some of his lyrics chosen by fans in an online poll. The park houses an aviary which is home to 9 resident peacocks. The park also holds a former petting zoo, a large greenhouse and three playgrounds. Pittencreiff park has been home to the Dunfermline Parkrun since its inception in July 2015. Be Military Fit run classes in the park. Friends of Pittencrieff Park The Friends of Pittencrieff Park is a registered charity and a SCIO (Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation) which has been in existence for almost 12 years and one of their most important functions is to liaise with Fife Council and the Carnegie Trust to ensure Pittencrieff Park (or the Glen as it is known locally) remains an outstanding visitor attraction for residents of Dunfermline and visitors to the area. They also undertake fund raising in order to finance projects such as renewal of play areas, creation and upkeep of the orchard and the kitchen garden, welfare of the peacocks etc. Notes Pittencrieff Park Gardens in Pittencrieff Park Bibliography * * * External links *official park website run by Fife Council *Fife Council Facilities page *Dunfermline Parkrun *The Dover War Memorial Project Information on the figure of youth fountain created by Dovorian Richard Reginald Goulden, and other casts from the same mould including Dover Town War Memorial *The Friends of Pittencrieff Park Official site of the Friends of the park Charity Category:Dunfermline Category:Andrew Carnegie Category:Parks in Fife Category:Museums in Fife Category:Natural history museums in Scotland Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:1903 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Pittencrieff Park"},{"id":"20332673","text":"Macedonski (rarely spelled Macedonschi or Macedonsky) is a toponymic surname, derived from Macedonia.

These cysts may begin to develop in utero, in infancy, in childhood, or in adulthood. Cysts are non-functioning tubules filled with fluid pumped into them, which range in size from microscopic to enormous, crushing adjacent normal tubules and eventually rendering them non-functional as well. PKD is caused by abnormal genes that produce a specific abnormal protein; this protein has an adverse effect on tubule development. PKD is a general term for two types, each having their own pathology and genetic cause: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The abnormal gene exists in all cells in the body; as a result, cysts may occur in the liver, seminal vesicles, and pancreas. This genetic defect can also cause aortic root aneurysms, and aneurysms in the circle of Willis cerebral arteries, which if they rupture, can cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Diagnosis may be suspected from one, some, or all of the following: new onset flank pain or red urine; a positive family history; palpation of enlarged kidneys on physical exam; an incidental finding on abdominal sonogram; or an incidental finding of abnormal kidney function on routine lab work (BUN, serum creatinine, or eGFR). Definitive diagnosis is made by abdominal CT exam. Complications include hypertension due to the activation of the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS), frequent cyst infections, urinary bleeding, and declining renal function. Hypertension is treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Infections are treated with antibiotics. Declining renal function is treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT): dialysis and/or transplantation. Management from the time of the suspected or definitive diagnosis is by a board-certified nephrologist. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headaches, abdominal pain, blood in the urine, and excessive urination. Other symptoms include pain in the back, and cyst formation (renal and other organs). Cause PKD is caused by abnormal genes which produce a specific abnormal protein which has an adverse effect on tubule development. PKD is a general term for two types, each having their own pathology and genetic cause: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Autosomal dominant CT scan showing autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Cartoon of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with normal kidney inset to right of diagram Cartoon of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease with normal kidney inset to right of diagram Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common of all the inherited cystic kidney diseases with an incidence of 1:500 live births. Studies show that 10% of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients being treated with dialysis in Europe and the U.S. were initially diagnosed and treated for ADPKD. Genetic mutations in any of the three genes PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 have similar phenotypical presentations. * Gene PKD1 is located on chromosome 16 and codes for a protein involved in regulation of cell cycle and intracellular calcium transport in epithelial cells, and is responsible for 85% of the cases of ADPKD. * A group of voltage-linked cation channels, with inward selectivity for K>Na>>Ca and outward selectivity for Ca2+ ‚âà Ba2+ > Na+ ‚âà K+, are coded for by PKD2 on chromosome 4 * PKD3 recently appeared in research papers as a postulated third gene. Fewer than 10% of cases of ADPKD appear in non-ADPKD families. Cyst formation begins in utero from any point along the nephron, although fewer than 5% of nephrons are thought to be involved. As the cysts accumulate fluid, they enlarge, separate entirely from the nephron, compress the neighboring kidney parenchyma, and progressively compromise kidney function. Autosomal recessive Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) (OMIM #263200) is the lesser common of the two types of PKD, with an incidence of 1:20,000 live births and is typically identified in the first few weeks after birth. Unfortunately, the kidneys are often underdeveloped resulting in a 30% death rate in newborns with ARPKD. PKHD1 is involved. Mechanism PKD1 and PKD2 Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease cyst formation are tied to abnormal cilia-mediated signaling. The polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 proteins appear to be involved in both autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease due to defects in both proteins. Both proteins have communication with calcium channel proteins, and causes reduction in resting (intracellular) calcium and endoplasmic reticulum storage of calcium. The disease is characterized by a ‚Äòsecond hit‚Äô phenomenon, in which a mutated dominant allele is inherited from a parent, with cyst formation occurring only after the normal, wild-type gene sustains a subsequent second genetic ‚Äòhit‚Äô, resulting in renal tubular cyst formation and disease progression. PKD results from defects in the primary cilium, an immotile, hair-like cellular organelle present on the surface of most cells in the body, anchored in the cell body by the basal body. In the kidney, primary cilia have been found to be present on most cells of the nephron, projecting from the apical surface of the renal epithelium into the tubule lumen. The cilia were believed to bend in the urine flow, leading to changes in signalling, however this has since been shown to be an experimental error (the bending of cilia was an artifact of focal plane compensation, and also the actual effect on micturition by severe hypertension and cardiac arrest) and that bending of cilia does not contribute to alterations in Ca flux. While it is not known how defects in the primary cilium lead to cyst development, it is thought to possibly be related to disruption of one of the many signaling pathways regulated by the primary cilium, including intracellular calcium, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), or planar cell polarity (PCP). Function of the primary cilium is impaired, resulting in disruption of a number of intracellular signaling cascades which produce differentiation of cystic epithelium, increased cell division, increased apoptosis, and loss of resorptive capacity. Diagnosis Polycystic kidney disease can be ascertained via a CT scan of abdomen, as well as, an MRI and ultrasound of the same area. A physical exam/test can reveal enlarged liver, heart murmurs and elevated blood pressure Natural history Most cases progress to bilateral disease in adulthood. Treatment Chr 11 FISH-mapped BACs from CGAP There is no FDA-approved treatment. However, recent research indicates that mild to moderate dietary restrictions slow the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in mice. If and when the disease progresses enough in a given case, the nephrologist or other practitioner and the patient will have to decide what form of renal replacement therapy will be used to treat end-stage kidney disease (kidney failure, typically stage 4 or 5 of chronic kidney disease). That will either be some form of dialysis, which can be done at least two different ways at varying frequencies and durations (whether it is done at home or in the clinic depends on the method used and the patient's stability and training) and eventually, if they are eligible because of the nature and severity of their condition and if a suitable match can be found, unilateral or bilateral kidney transplantation. A Cochrane Review study of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease made note of the fact that it is important at all times, while avoiding antibiotic resistance, to control infections of the cysts in the kidneys, and if affected, the liver, when needed for a certain duration to combat infection, by using, \\"bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal drugs\\". Prognosis ADPKD individuals might have a normal life; conversely, ARPKD can cause kidney dysfunction and can lead to kidney failure by the age of 40‚Äì60. ADPKD1 and ADPKD2 are very different, in that ADPKD2 is much milder. Currently, there are no therapies proven effective to prevent the progression of ADPKD. Epidemiology PKD is one of the most common hereditary diseases in the United States, affecting more than 600,000 people. It is the cause of nearly 10% of all end-stage renal disease. It equally affects men, women, and all races. PKD occurs in some animals as well as humans.

Club career NK Zagreb Bi≈°kup played for NK Dinamo Zagreb in the Yugoslav First League and for NK Zagreb in Yugoslav Third League, Yugoslav Second League and later in the Croatian Prva HNL. Bi≈°kup spent almost entire his career in NK Zagreb. He started playing professional football in Dinamo, in which he did not receive sufficient minutes on the pitch. Therefore, he decided to join NK Zagreb, which then played in the third division. After two seasons in NK Zagreb he attempted to try one more time with Dinamo, but after his lack of opportunity in Dinamo once again, he returned to the Zagreb team in the season 1990/1991 when Zagreb played in second Yugoslav division and immediately helped them win championship and promotion to the First Division the following year, which have not been played due to the breakup of Yugoslavia. He stayed with Zagreb in the newly established Croatian football league and helped achieve the best results in the club's history. In 1992 season they ended up as vice-champions, after close battle with Hajduk. 1992‚Äì93 they won third place, and in 1993‚Äì94 they finished second again and again behind the Hajduk for only a point. After a short episode in Austria, he returned to Zagreb and in 1996‚Äì97 season made it to the Cup finals in which they lost undeserved with the referee help to Dinamo 1‚Äì2 at Maksimir. He played until the end of 1999‚Äì2000 season, when he decided to end his career at 35 years of age in his favorite club and leave his place to younger players. For Zagreb he played a total of 244 games in eleven seasons on three occasions and as a defensive player scored five goals. International career Bi≈°kup made five appearances for the full Croatia national football team. Coaching career After years of coaching in Suhopolje there was a desire for change. He replaced Suhopolje by another second-league club, NK Luƒçko, a club whose ambitions were much bigger. It was a debut season in the second division for NK Luƒçko. He took the club prior tenth round, and lost first game against NK Vinogradar away 3‚Äì1. In the end he won fourth place in the league, behind third-placed NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac who won promotion to the first division thanks to two goals scored more than NK Luƒçko since both teams won 42 points. The following 2010‚Äì11 season he managed to secure promotion to first division as vice-champions of the second division. Only better than them was HNK Gorica. In that season NK Luƒçko made a league record away win against the club which he also managed before, HNK Suhopolje, 7‚Äì0. He led the club in their debut season in the first division 2011‚Äì12 but did not remain long in the position of head coach because after five rounds, and only one point won in the first division, he concluded an agreement on terminating the contract with NK Luƒçko on 22 August 2011. Fatal set of results, which resulted in termination of the contract was 1‚Äì1 vs Zadar, 0‚Äì1 vs Rijeka, 0‚Äì2 vs Istra 1961, 0‚Äì1 vs Zagreb and 1‚Äì2 vs Split. At the end of the season NK Luƒçko still failed to save their status as a major league club by finishing thirteenth out of sixteen clubs in the championship and were relegated to the second league. Just a few days after, he took up a new job at NK Zelina. NK Zelina competed in the third league and after having played the first round at home against Krk in which they draw 1‚Äì1 he was appointed for a head coach just one day before the second round. In his first game on Zelina bench they played away game against one of competitors in the league for the promotion, Vrapƒçe and lost. At end of the championship however, they were able to catch up and become the 2011‚Äì12 league champions ahead of Vrapƒçe thanks to a better goal difference since they both had 69 points and won promotion to the Croatian Second League. His second term in NK Luƒçko began in season 2016/17 when he avoided relegation to Croatian third division. However, he left NK Luƒçko at the end of season. In season 2017/2018 after Besnik Prenga was sacked, it was announced that Drazen Biskup will replace him and join his former club one more time.https://nk-lucko.hr/novi-trener-prve-momcadi/ Statistics {   center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Nat !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"8\\"Record - !G!!W!!D!!L!!GF!!GA!!+/- -  NK Luƒçko align=\\"middle\\"October 2009 align=\\"left\\"August 2011 52286188155+26 -  NK Zelina align=\\"left\\"September 2011 align=\\"middle\\"June 2012 3321576429+35 - !colspan=\\"4\\"Total ! 85 !! 49 !! 11 !! 25 !! 145 !! 84 !! +61 } G ‚Äì Matches managed; W ‚Äì Matches won; D ‚Äì Matches drawn; L ‚Äì Matches lost; GF ‚Äì Goals for; GA ‚Äì Goals against References External links * *Dra≈æen Bi≈°kup at Soccerway * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Zagreb Category:NK Zagreb players Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia international footballers Category:Croatian expatriate footballers Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:GNK Dinamo Zagreb players Category:FC Admira Wacker M√∂dling players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Croatian football managers Category:NK Vinogradar managers Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Dra≈æen Bi≈°kup"},{"id":"20332785","text":"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is the recessive form of polycystic kidney disease. It is associated with a group of congenital fibrocystic syndromes. Mutations in the PKHD1 (chromosomal locus 6p12.2) cause ARPKD. Signs and symptoms Symptoms and signs include abdominal discomfort, polyuria, polydipsia, incidental discovery of hypertension, abdominal mass. The classic presentation for ARPKD is systemic hypertension with progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by the age of 15. In a typical presentation, a small number of ARPKD sufferers live to adulthood with some kidney function; but with significant deterioration in liver function. This outcome is postulated to result from expression of the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene PKHD1, which is located on chromosome 6p. In severe cases, a fetus will present with oligohydramnios and as a result, may present with Potter sequence. Genetics The cause of ARPKD is linked to mutations in the PKHD1 gene. Micrograph of von Meyenburg complex. ARPKD is a significant hereditary renal disease in that appears in childhood. The prevalence is estimated to be of 1 in 20,000 live births. With a reported carrier frequency of up to 1:70. The single gene mutation called ‚Äò‚ÄôPKHD1‚Äô‚Äô is fully responsible for the disease presentation of ARPKD. This PKHD1 is located on the human chromosome region 6p21.1-6p12.2. It is also one of the largest genes in the genome as it occupies approximately 450 kb of DNA, and contains at least 86 exons. It is capable of producing multiple alternatively spliced transcripts. The largest known transcript encodes fibrocystin /polyductin (FPC), which is a large receptor-like integral membrane protein of 4074 amino acids. The structure of the FPC consist of a single transmembrane, a large N-terminal extracellular region, and a short intracellular cytoplasmic domain. The FPC protein is found on the primary cilia of epithelia cells of cortical and medullary collecting ducts and cholangiocytes of bile ducts, and show similarity to polycystins and several other ciliopathy proteins. FPC is also found to be expressed on the basal body and plasma membrane. It is presumed that the large extracellular domain of FPC binds to a ligand(s) that is yet unknown and that is also involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. It is known that FPC interacts with ADPKD protein PC2 and may also participate in this regulation pathway of the mechanosensory function of the primary cilia, calcium signaling, and PCP. This is suggesting a common mechanism underlying cystogenesis between ADPKD and ARPKD. The FPC protein is also found on the centrosomes and mitotic spindle and may regulate centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assembly during cell division. There have been a large number of various single gene mutations found throughout PKHD1 and are unique to individual families. Most of the patients are compound heterozygotes for PKHD1 mutations. Patients with two nonsense mutations appear to have an earlier onset of the disease. Diagnosis Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease with a normal kidney inset Ultrasonography is the primary method to evaluate autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, particularly in the perinatal and neonatal stages. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnoses of this condition include: * Glomerulocystic kidney disease * Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease * Diffuse cystic dysplasia Treatment The treatment options for autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, given there is no current cure, are: * Medications for hypertension * Medications and/or surgery for pain * Antibiotics for infection * Dialysis (if kidney failure is present) * Kidney transplantation(in serious cases) References Further reading * *  External links  Category:Kidney diseases Category:Ciliopathy Category:Rare diseases ","title":"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease"},{"id":"20332838","text":"Agr√°ria is the rugby union sports team of the students' union of the Escola Superior Agr√°ria de Coimbra (Agrarian School of Coimbra), based in Coimbra, Portugal.

He also was a member of the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He played college football at Arizona State University. Early years Clack was a native of San Antonio, Texas, before moving to Colorado during high school. Known as \\"Mr. Click\\" back then, he attended Widefield High School. He was at his best in track and field, winning the state championship in the 100 metres in his junior and senior years. He missed winning in a closed finish as a sophomore, but won the 200 metres and the 400 metres in each of his last three years in high school. He set the state-record time of 10.65 seconds in the 100 metres, 21.22 in the 200 and 47.95 in the 400. He also contributed to Widefield winning team state titles in 1979, 1980 and 1981. Clack earned All- state honors at running back as a senior. He also practiced basketball. In 1982, he was named Colorado Prep Athlete of the Year. In 2006, he was inducted into the Colorado Springs Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was inducted into the Colorado High School Hall of Fame. College career Clack accepted a football scholarship from Arizona State University. In 1982, he became the first freshman to lead the Sun Devils in rushing in 30 years. His season culminated with the 32-21 win over the University of Oklahoma in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl, with him scoring a third-quarter touchdown. Even as a freshman, his popularity reached a point that metal noisemakers known as \\"Darryl Clackers\\", were being sold by stadium vendors. He posted 606 rushing yards, 116 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns. As a sophomore, he registered 932 rushing yards (led the Pac-10), 299 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns. His 221 rushing yards against Wichita State University ranked sixth All-time in the school rushing list. He became the first player in school history to gain over 100 yards rushing and receiving in the same game (116 rushing and 134 receiving against USC). As a junior, he posted 1,052 rushing yards, 32 receptions for 385 yards, 6 touchdowns and had five 100-yard rushing days. His senior season was cut short when he suffered a fractured right fibula in the second game of the season against Pacific University, sidelining him for 7 games. He returned to play in the 1985 Holiday Bowl, gaining 36 yards on nine carries. Clack finished his college career fifth on the school's All-time rushing list, recording 2,711 rushing yards (fifth in school history), 5.1-yard average, 21 rushing touchdowns, 70 receptions, 840 receiving yards, 3 receiving touchdowns and eleven 100-yard games (Arizona State was 10-1 in those contests). He also was a member of the track and field team for three years. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Clack was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (33rd overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft, to be the backup and possible successor to Tony Dorsett. Unfortunately for Clack, that was the same year that Herschel Walker arrived to the team from the United States Football League (USFL). The talent level at running back, relegated him to returning kickoffs. As a rookie, he averaged 22.2 yards per kickoff return and would have qualified for fifth place in the NFC with one more return. Against the Washington Redskins, he had a career high 51-yard return. In 1987, his 21.9-yard per kickoff return placed him seventh in the NFC. In 1988, he was the NFC's third leading kickoff returner with a 21.6-yard average. In 1989, he had just 3 kickoff returns, finishing 2 returns short of Mel Renfro's franchise record of 85. On November 21, he was waived as part of the rebuilding process, to make room for rookie running back Curtis Stewart who was promoted from the developmental squad. Cleveland Browns On March 8, 1990, he signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Browns. He was released on September 3. Toronto Argonauts (CFL) On September 5, 1991, he was signed to the practice roster of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. He played in the Grey Cup championship game. He appeared in 4 games as a backup running back, registering 22 carries for 24 yards. Orlando Thunder (WLAF) In 1992, he signed with the Orlando Thunder of the World League of American Football. He became the team's starter at running back, tallying 517 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns, while receiving All-World League honors at the end of the season. Personal life After his playing days, Clack went to the University of Texas at El Paso earning a B.A. in Kinesiology and Sports Studies. He moved around the business world for a time and settled into the banking business as vice president at Compass Bank in Tempe, Arizona, not far from the Arizona State University campus. After banking he accumulated over 15 years of extensive experience in management and leadership at various companies including Cox Communications. He then earned an M.A. in Organizational Management from the University of Phoenix and was in his first year of working towards a Ph.D. when he fell ill to Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare autoimmune blood disorder. In addition to TTP, in July 2016, he learned of his early-stage dementia diagnose, due to years of trauma to the head from playing football. These traumatic events, three months apart, prompted Darryl to write the book \\"Hear My Story Before I Forget\\" and start a foundation to bring awareness to TTP and brain injuries. Although he is no longer playing ball, he keeps his hand in the game as President and co-founder of SportMetric, along with co-founders Josh Jakubczak and Darius Perry, a company emphasizing education, community involvement, and athletics for the youth.

(Mus√©e du Louvre) The sleepwalking scene is a critically celebrated scene from William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (1606). The first scene in the tragedy's 5th act, the sleepwalking scene is written principally in prose, and follows the guilt-wracked, sleepwalking Lady Macbeth as she recollects horrific images and impressions from her past. The scene is Lady Macbeth's last on-stage appearance, though her death is reported later in the act. Well known phrases from the scene include \\"Out, damned spot!\\" and \\"All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\\" The British tragedienne Sarah Siddons (1755‚Äì1831) was distinguished for her performance and interpretation of the scene. Summary The sleepwalking sceneMacbeth, Act 5, Scene 1. opens with a conference between two characters making their first appearances, the Doctor of Physic and the Waiting-Gentlewoman. The Gentlewoman indicates Lady Macbeth has walked in her sleep. She will not report to the Doctor anything Lady Macbeth has spoken in her somnambulistic state, having no witness to confirm her testimony. Carrying a taper (candlestick), Lady Macbeth enters sleepwalking. The Doctor and the Gentlewoman stand aside to observe. The Doctor asks how Lady Macbeth came to have the light. The Gentlewoman replies she has ordered a light be beside her at all times (she is now afraid of the dark, having committed her crimes under its cover). Lady Macbeth rubs her hands in a washing motion. With anguish, she recalls the deaths of King Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo, then leaves. The Gentlewoman and the bewildered Doctor exeunt, realizing these are the symptoms of a guilt-ridden mind. The Doctor feels Lady Macbeth is beyond his help, saying she has more need of \\"the divine than the physician\\". He orders the Gentlewoman to remove from Lady Macbeth the \\"means of all annoyance\\", anticipating she might commit suicide. Despite his warning, the audience are informed she does commit suicide off-stage. Analysis A.C. Bradley indicates, with the exception of the scene's few closing lines, the scene is entirely in prose with Lady Macbeth being the only major character in Shakespearean tragedy to make a last appearance \\"denied the dignity of verse.\\" According to Bradley, Shakespeare generally assigned prose to characters exhibiting abnormal states of mind or abnormal conditions such as somnambulism, with the regular rhythm of verse being inappropriate to characters having lost their balance of mind or subject to images or impressions with no rational connection. Lady Macbeth's recollections ‚Äì the blood on her hand, the clock striking, her husband's reluctance ‚Äì are brought forth from her disordered mind in chance order with each image deepening her anguish. For Bradley, Lady Macbeth's \\"brief toneless sentences seem the only voice of truth\\"Bradley, A. C. Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth. 2nd ed. London: Macmillan, 1905. p. 400. with the spare and simple construction of the character's diction expressing a \\"desolating misery.\\"A.C. Bradley. Shakespearean Tragedy. Palgrave Macmillan; 4th edition, 2007. Performances Sarah Siddons in the Sleepwalking Scene John Philip Kemble's 1794 Drury Lane production starred his leading lady and sister Sarah Siddons who offered a fiercely psychological portrait of Lady Macbeth. Siddons was noted for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her depiction of a soul in profound torment. Siddons' interpretations contributed to the then new movement in literary criticism that focused on character as the essence of Shakespearean drama.Bevington, David, and Kastan, David Scott. Four Tragedies. (Performance histories). Bantam, 1988. William Hazlitt commented on Siddons' interpretation and performance of the sleepwalking scene: > In coming on in the sleeping-scene, her eyes were open, but their sense was > shut. She was like a person bewildered and unconscious of what she did. Her > lips moved involuntarily‚Äîall her gestures were involuntary and mechanical. > She glided on and off the stage like an apparition. To have seen her in that > character was an event in every one's life, not to be forgotten. In modern times, Francesca Annis garnered attention for her performance in Roman Polanski's film version of Macbeth (1971), in which she performs the sleepwalking soliloquy in the nude. The critic Kenneth Tynan was present when the scene was shot: > Francesca does it very sportingly and with no fuss ... though of course the > set is closed, great curtains are drawn around the acting area ... and the > wardrobe mistress rushes to cover Francesca with a dressing gown the instant > Roman says, 'Cut'.Diary, 16 February 1971: The Diaries of Kenneth Tynan (ed. > John Lahr, 2001) References Category:Macbeth Category:Mental illness in fiction Category:Sleepwalking ","title":"Sleepwalking scene"},{"id":"20333106","text":"General elections were held in Sweden between 4 and 17 September 1920,Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1858 the last before universal suffrage was introduced the following year.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1853 The Social Democratic Party remained the largest party, winning 75 of the 230 seats in the Second Chamber of the Riksdag.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1871 Later in October 1920 Hjalmar Branting was succeeded as Prime Minister by Baron Louis De Geer.

Pastore began his club career with Talleres and then Hurac√°n in his native Argentina before moving to Serie A team Palermo in 2009 for a reported transfer fee of ‚Ç¨4.7 million. In 2011, French side Paris Saint- Germain bought him for a reported ‚Ç¨39.8 million. He won numerous domestic honours with the club, including five Ligue 1 titles, before joining Roma in 2018, for a fee of ‚Ç¨24.7 million. At international level, Pastore made his senior debut in 2010, and has since gone on to make over 20 appearances for his country. He represented Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and at three editions of the Copa Am√©rica, reaching consecutive finals of the latter competition in 2015 and 2016. Club career Early life Pastore was born in C√≥rdoba in an Italian-Argentine family originally from Volvera, Turin. He started his career in the youth system of the Argentine club Talleres, and slowly worked his way up to the first team. In 2007, he made his debut in the Argentine second division under the wing of manager Ricardo Gareca. In 2007, he only managed to play five games. Hurac√°n During the 2008 season, Pastore was loaned to Hurac√°n of the Argentine Primera. He made his professional debut for Hurac√°n on 24 May 2008 in a 1‚Äì0 loss with River Plate. In the 2009 Clausura championship, he established himself as a regular first- team player for the club under the management of √Ångel Cappa. This was his breakthrough tournament, where his side narrowly missed out on the championship title. His performance against River Plate was particularly lauded where he opened the scoring with a 25-yard shot and then scored again with a piece of individual brilliance helping Hurac√°n win 4‚Äì0 in the club's biggest win against River Plate in over 60 years. He ended up as the team's top scorer with seven goals and three assists. Pastore and teammate Mat√≠as De Federico was integral to Hurac√°n's title challenge that season. Palermo On 11 July 2009 Palermo formally announced the signing of Pastore for five years until 30 June 2014, with the transfer fee listed at approximately ‚Ç¨4.7 million.El futuro de Pastore estar√≠a en Italia at Sports YA Before his move to Palermo, the player was also linked to number of other top European clubs, including Manchester United, Porto, Milan and Chelsea. Pastore's debut was on 15 August in the Coppa Italia, while his debut in Serie A came eight days later. His breakthrough game was on 4 October against Juventus, when he assisted Edinson Cavani's goal in a 2‚Äì0 win, appearing in all the websites and national newspapers. He scored his first Serie A goal on 30 January 2010 in a 2‚Äì4 away defeat to Bari. In his first season at Palermo, Pastore proved himself as being a promising but inexperienced youngster, playing mostly as a second-half substitute under head coaches Walter Zenga and, later, Delio Rossi. Pastore then established himself as a regular under the tutelage of Rossi, playing usually in a role behind the regular striking duo of Fabrizio Miccoli and Edinson Cavani. Thanks to his performances, all praised by fans and pundits, Palermo finished off the season in fifth place, thus qualifying for the UEFA Europa League. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, on 14 November, Pastore scored his first career hat-trick in a derby match against Catania. On 30 July 2011, Palermo club president Maurizio Zamparini revealed that a fee had been agreed over Javier Pastore's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. Paris Saint- Germain Pastore with PSG in August 2011 Pastore playing against Chelsea in UCL On 6 August 2011, Paris Saint-Germain formally announced the signing of Pastore, issuing him the number 27 shirt. The transfer fee throughout was ‚Ç¨39.8 million. However, due to third-party ownership by his agent Marcelo Simonian, who would received ‚Ç¨12.5 million (not known it included agent fee or not) Palermo announced through its website that the club received only ‚Ç¨22.8 million of the total fee. Palermo club president Maurizio Zamparini had started a legal action over the matter, despite the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) prohibiting any Italian club from forming any ownership agreement with third parties, which Zamparini acknowledged risked a punishment for himself. Pastore scored his first goal in a Ligue 1 match against Stade Brestois in a 1‚Äì0 win on 11 September 2011. During his first season at the Parc des Princes, Pastore scored 13 goals in 33 league matches. The following year, Pastore appeared in 34 league matches as PSG won the first of four consecutive Ligue 1 titles. He also scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 4‚Äì1 win over FC Dynamo Kyiv on 18 September 2012. In 2014‚Äì15, Pastore made over 50 appearances and was named in the UNFP team of the season as PSG won an unprecedented domestic quadruple of Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and the Troph√©e des Champions. Ahead of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Pastore inherited the number 10 shirt from the departing Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, switching from the number 27 shirt. As with 2015‚Äì16, he missed a large portion of the season through injuries, but returned to the PSG starting line-up for Le Classique against rivals Olympique de Marseille, where he assisted Edinson Cavani in a 5‚Äì1 Ligue 1 away win on 26 February 2017. Three days later, he came on as a substitute and scored the opening goal, before assisting Cavani again as PSG defeated Ligue 2 club Chamois Niortias 2‚Äì0 to reach the quarter-final stage of the 2016‚Äì17 Coupe de France. On 19 March 2017, Pastore assisted both of PSG's goals by crossing the ball to the scorers Adrien Rabiot and Julian Draxler in their 2-1 Ligue 1 home win over Olympique Lyonnais. On 17 May 2017, Pastore appeared as a 72nd-minute substitute for Julian Draxler as PSG defeated Angers 1‚Äì0 in the 2017 Coupe de France Final. Before the start of the next season, he vacated his number 10 jersey to new signing Neymar as a welcome gift and reclaimed his previous number 27 jersey. On 8 May 2018, he came off the bench as PSG won 2‚Äì0 against Les Herbiers VF to clinch the 2017‚Äì18 Coupe de France. Roma On 26 June 2018, Pastore signed a five-year contract with Italian side Roma from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported fee of ‚Ç¨24.7m. He was handed the number 27 shirt. He made his club debut in a 1‚Äì0 away win over Torino in Serie A on 19 August. He scored his first goal for the club on 27 August, opening the scoring with a back-heeled goal in the second minute of play in an eventual 3‚Äì3 home draw against Atalanta in the league. International career Following a string of good performances in his first season in Serie A, Argentina head coach Diego Maradona called up Pastore for an unofficial friendly match against the Catalonia \\"national\\" team on 22 December 2009. Pastore made his debut as a second-half substitute, scoring a goal in the process. Since the match was not a FIFA-recognized representative game, however, Pastore did not receive a cap. Pastore was subsequently called up by Maradona again for a friendly game against Germany, but did not make an appearance. His official debut was against Canada on 25 May 2010, and he was subsequently included by Maradona in Argentina's 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. On 22 June, he made his FIFA World Cup debut when he came on the pitch in the 77th minute against Greece, replacing Sergio Ag√ºero. Argentina won the match 2‚Äì0. On 27 June, he was again substituted on against Mexico in the 87th minute, this time replacing Maxi Rodr√≠guez. Argentina won the match 3‚Äì1. Pastore was included by manager Sergio Batista in Argentina's 23-man squad for the 2011 Copa Am√©rica on home soil. Argentina were eliminated by eventual champions Uruguay on penalties in the quarter-finals. Pastore scored his first senior international goal on 31 March 2015, in a 2‚Äì1 friendly win over Ecuador, at the MetLife Stadium, in New Jersey. Later that year, Pastore was selected by coach Gerardo Martino for the 2015 Copa Am√©rica, and started in the team's opening fixture against Paraguay in La Serena. At the semi-final stage, Pastore scored the team's second goal and assisted √Ångel Di Mar√≠a for the third as Argentina defeated Paraguay 6‚Äì1 to reach the tournament final. In the final against hosts Chile on 4 July, Pastore came off for √âver Banega in the 81st minute; following a 0‚Äì0 draw after extra-time, Chile claimed the title with a 4‚Äì1 penalty shoot-out victory. In 2016, Pastore was included in Argentina's 23-man squad for the Copa Am√©rica Centenario. Argentina went on to reach the final, only to lose out on penalties to Chile once again. Style of play An elegant, creative and technically gifted advanced playmaker, with excellent dribbling skills and close control, Pastore is capable of playing in several offensive roles, due to his ability to both score and create goals. Although he is usually deployed as an attacking midfielder due to his vision, passing and striking ability from distance, he is also capable of functioning as a winger, as a supporting striker or even as a forward, and has also been deployed in more withdrawn midfield roles on occasion, operating as a central midfielder, as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as a mezzala, due to his work- rate, creativity, skill, and physical attributes, despite his lack of notable pace. A talented, strong, quick and hard-working right-footed player, his playing style has drawn comparisons to Kak√°, Zinedine Zidane, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá and one of his childhood idols, Enzo Francescoli, although Pastore has stated that his main influence is compatriot Juan Rom√°n Riquelme. Nicknamed \\"El Flaco\\" (like Francescoli before him) due to his tall, slender build, he was regarded as a highly promising player as a youngster, and in 2010, Don Bal√≥n named him as one of the 100 best young players in the world born after 1989. Despite his talent, however, he is known to injury prone, and has also drawn criticism in the media for being inconsistent.

It features a city news section, a national news section, a world news section, a sports section, a comics section, and a classifieds section. The paper is owned by Alta Newspaper Group, which also owns the daily Lethbridge Herald and several weekly newspapers covering nearby rural communities. It has been published since 1885. On Oct. 29, 1885, the first issue of the forerunner to the Medicine Hat News, the Times, was run off a tiny hand press. It's not conclusive, but there are a number of people who are pretty sure that a boxcar embedded in a building at 525 North Railway St. is the site of the first building. Thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of two Ontarions, teacher Thomas Braden and printer Andrew Armour, Medicine Hat was home to a newspaper, a community booster, a voice for southeastern Alberta and a publication that residents of the area still turn to 125 years later to find out what's happening in their backyard, their province, country and around the world. Armour and Braden had ventured west from Ontario two years earlier, setting up a newspaper in Calgary, before looking east to Medicine Hat and the fledgling tent city that it was at that time. In 1896, the then Medicine Hat Weekly News set up shop in a building adjacent to the former American Hotel on South Railway Street., and later moved to a two-storey building at the corner of Second and Sixth downtown in 1914. In 1958, operations moved into the adjacent Empress Theatre. In 1981, the News offices and printing plant moved to Dunmore Road, where it continues to operate today. Until 1997, the News was an \\"afternoon\\" paper, but switched to a morning publication. The front page of the inaugural morning edition, on May 5, 1997, featured a story exposing unprecedented tampering by Bre-X Minerals at its gold mine in Indonesia. Two more ownership changes occurred since 2000. In 2002, the News was sold by Thomson to the Alberta Newspaper Group. In 2008, Glacier Media Inc. assumed a 50-per-cent interest in the paper.

To the naked eye, it appears as a single star with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 3.74, making it the brightest visible star in the constellation. A telescope shows a curved line of three pale blue stars (or pale yellow stars, depending on the scope's focus). William Herschel who discovered it in 1781 commented that it is \\"one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens\\". The star system consists of three Be stars, Œ≤ Monocerotis A, Œ≤ Monocerotis B, and Œ≤ Monocerotis C. There is also an additional visual companion star that is probably not physically close to the other three stars. System The three stars of Œ≤ Monocerotis lie approximately in a straight line. Component B is 7\\" from component A, and component C a further 3\\" away. The stars have a common proper motion across the sky and very similar radial velocities. They share a single Hipparcos satellite identifier and are assumed to be at the same distance, around 700 light years based on their parallax. Œ≤ Monocerotis is classified as a variable star, although it is unclear which of the three components causes the brightness changes. The magnitude range is given as 3.77 to 3.84 in the Hipparcos photometric band. Beta Monocerotis A Beta Monocerotis A (Beta Mon A, Œ≤ Monocerotis A, Œ≤ Mon A) is a Be shell star with a mass of approximately 7 solar masses and a luminosity of 3,200 times the Sun's. Beta Monocerotis B Beta Monocerotis B (Beta Mon B / Œ≤ Monocerotis B / Œ≤ Mon B) is a Be star with a mass of approximately 6.2 solar masses and a luminosity of 1,600 times the Sun's. Beta Monocerotis C Beta Monocerotis C (Beta Mon C / Œ≤ Monocerotis C / Œ≤ Mon C) is a Be star with a mass of approximately 6 solar masses and a luminosity of 1,300 times the Sun's. This star was observed to be double in speckle interferometric observations in 1988, but this has not been confirmed by later infrared observations.Table 1, . Visual companion The triple star system has a visual companion, CCDM J06288-0702D, which has an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 12 and is visible approximately 25 arcseconds away from Œ≤ Monocerotis A. It is probably not physically close to the other three stars, merely appearing next to them in the sky.

The book argues that heavy metal began with Black Sabbath in 1970, then traces the emergence of 'proto-' heavy metal bands including Budgie and Captain Beyond. He continues through the 1970s with hard rock bands such as Van Halen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, then charts the emergence of NWOBHM, practiced by Iron Maiden and Raven, and thrash metal acts such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer, and subsequent genres including grindcore, death metal, and black metal. The book has served as the basis for university-level courses studying heavy metal at Miami University of Ohio, University of Rochester, and West Texas A&M; University. Source interviews Sound of the Beast is based on a narrative drawn from over a hundred original interviews with members of Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Kiss, Judas Priest, Raven, Tygers of Pan Tang, Venom, Saxon, Exciter, Dio, Twisted Sister, Armored Saint, Plasmatics, Misfits, Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax, Possessed, Hirax, Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Voivod, Nuclear Assault, Sepultura, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, White Zombie, Public Enemy, Danzig, Soundgarden, Fear Factory, Mayhem, Emperor, Immortal, Mortiis, Slipknot, and other bands.

Reception Greg Burk, writing for the LA Weekly in 2003, dubbed Sound of the Beast: ‚ÄúThe first book to chart the vector of not just metal‚Äôs origins, but the myriad mutations through which it continues to infect the planet.‚Äù Brent Burton, writing for the Washington City Paper, deigned that \\"Like Nick Tosches' 1977 Country, Christe's Sound of the Beast takes a deep-focus view of music that most regard as one- dimensional‚Äîdrawing attention to some of the rawest purveyors of each subgenre. However, unlike Tosches' writing, Christe's descriptions of the music he so clearly loves are often ungainly. On his beloved Sabbath: 'Above all else they had the best riffs, the huge guitar and bass lines that last a lifetime.' And on Metallica: 'Kill 'Em All might have been the first record fast enough that when fans played it to the point of skipping, a full chorus could be captured in a single revolution of the vinyl.' Christe also falters when he inexplicably attempts to beat metal's 'white music' rap without any ammo: Hard rockers Phil Lynott and Slash are among a mere handful of names enlisted for the cause.\\" References External links * Category:Heavy metal publications Category:2003 non-fiction books ","title":"Sound of the Beast"},{"id":"20333286","text":"Luib () is a crofting and fishing settlement on the south east shore of the sea loch, Loch Ainort near Broadford, on the island of Skye in Scotland.

The portage ran approximately two and one-half miles from the Namekagon River (in the St. Croix River watershed) to Windigo Lake in the Chippewa River watershed. The route then proceeded from Windigo Lake through Grindstone Lake to Lac Courte Oreilles where a well known Ojibwa village was located. This portage was used as one of the alternative routes to the Mississippi River for persons passing from Lake Superior to the Mississippi River by way of the Bois Brule River, as described below. One of the important routes from Lake Superior to the Mississippi River led southward on the Bois Brule River to the Lake Superior/Mississippi River divide. From this point, a portage of approximately two miles passed over the divide to Upper St. Croix Lake (Bois Brule-St. Croix Portage). The route then led southward down the St. Croix to its junction with the Namekagon River. At this point, there were two major alternative routes to the Mississippi River. The most direct route continued southward down the St. Croix River to its junction with the Mississippi River near present-day Hastings, Minnesota. However, this route led through territory held by Sioux Indians who were often at odds with the Ojibwa Indians of the upper St. Croix. The Ojibwa frequently acted as guides for the European explorers. In order to avoid potential problems with the Sioux Indians on the lower St. Croix River, travelers could alternatively reach the Mississippi by way of the Chippewa River watershed.See, for example, Journals of Jonathan Carver; ed. John Parker; Minnesota Historical Society Press; St. Paul; 1976 at page 126 where the party made a decision to use the Chippewa River rather than the St. Croix River for this reason. This was done by proceeding eastward from the St. Croix/Namekagon junction up the Namekagon River to the vicinity of current Hayward, Wisconsin. At this point, the route followed the Namekagon Portage across the divide between the St. Croix and Chippewa watersheds to Windigo Lake, through Grindstone Lake and Lac Courte Oreilles, and down the Couderay River to the Chippewa River which ultimately joined the Mississippi River at Lake Pepin. Explorer Jonathan Carver passed through the area in 1767 traveling north from the Mississippi River to Lake Superior by way of the Chippewa River. His journal entry and survey journal for June 29 and 30, 1767 record his leaving the Ojibwa Indian village on Lac Courte Oreilles, passing through Grindstone Lake and Windigo Lake, and using the Namekagon Portage to reach the Namekagon River.Journals of Jonathan Carver; ed. John Parker; Minnesota Historical Society Press; St. Paul; 1976 (pages 129 and 167). An historical marker at the portage site (see external link below) indicates that Michel Cadotte established a fur-trading post at the northwestern end of the portage in 1784. The area was later visited by Henry Schoolcraft in 1831 who described the Namekagon Portage running from the Namekagon River to Lac Courte Oreilles by way of Windigo Lake (called by him Lac des Isles) and Grindstone Lake (called by him Lac du Gres).Schoolcraft's Expedition to Lake Itasca; ed. Philip P. Mason; Michigan State University Press; East Lansing; 1958 (page 6). The southeastern end of the Namekagon Portage is now indicated by an historical marker located approximately five and one-half miles south of Hayward on State Highway 27 (see external link below). According to statements in an opinion of the Wisconsin Attorney General, portions of the portage trail were apparently still visible and used by the general public as of 1986. However, in this opinion the Wisconsin Attorney General states that this portage has now been abandoned and replaced by other transportation methods.

It has been the official retreat of the President of the French Republic since 1968. History Location of the Fort de Br√©gan√ßon The island has long been occupied, due in part to its easily defended nature, and that it allows easy view of the sea access to Hy√®res and Toulon. The island was the site of a Ligurian oppidum in the 6th century BCE. The fort seen from the coast In the eleventh century, the territory belonged to the Viscount of Marseille, lieutenants of the Count of Provence, who sold it to the Community of Marseille. In 1257, following the marriage of heiress Beatrice of Provence, with Charles I of Anjou who was the brother of King Louis IX, the island became part of the Kingdom of France. Charles subsequently became King of the Two Sicilies, and hence began a programme of sea defence improvement, including the fort at Br√©gan√ßon. In 1348, after staying at Br√©gan√ßon, Queen Jeanne of Naples and Sicily donated Br√©gan√ßon to Jacques de Galbert, a ship owner based in Marseille whom she had appointed a Vice Admiral of Provence, by an Act dated 31 July 1348. In 1366 she revoked the Act, returning Br√©gan√ßon to the crown of the Two Sicilies. In 1480, Charles of Maine, last ruler of Provence, bequeathed his county to King Louis XI of France. After the King confided Br√©gan√ßon to Provencal captains, the current fort was built on the island in 1483 by Jean de Baudricourt as part of the French monarchy's coastal defence efforts. In 1574, King Henry III of France donated Br√©gan√ßon by letters patent to Antoine Escalin des Aymars, baron of the guard, captain general of the galleys. The fort and estate were separated in 1786. Napol√©on Bonaparte became interested in Br√©gan√ßon after the recapture of Toulon, and after initial repairs endowed it with improved artillery, and then strengthened the garrison with a company of Imperial veterans. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the War Ministry commissioned work to ensure that the fort could receive modern artillery and a powder magazine, without affecting the external appearance of the fortress. The allowed a small garrison to occupy the fort during World War I, but this was decommissioned in 1919. From the 1920s, excluding the period of World War II, the French Republic rented the fort to various private individuals, the last being a former Minister of Marine of the Third Republic, Robert Bellanger, who with approval restored the fort to become a comfortable private residence whilst preserving its original appearance. Presidential residence After the expiry of the lease to Bellanger in 1963, the state took possession of the fort. It became a presidential residence in 1968 during the presidency of Charles de Gaulle (1890‚Äì1970). In 1985 Fran√ßois Mitterrand invited Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Br√©gan√ßon.Michaela Weigel (September 7, 2014), Festung Br√©gan√ßon: Ein nackter Pr√§sident auf dem Balkon Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. It was used only once by President Nicolas Sarkozy and his then wife C√©cilia Ciganer-Alb√©niz. Since 2007, La Lanterne in Yvelines has also been used as a retreat. It was also only used once by President Fran√ßois Hollande and his partner Val√©rie Trierweiler, in the summer of 2012, when it was discovered it was not sufficiently private, too easy a target for paparazzi. In October 2013, it was announced it would become a national monument open to the public, in an effort to reduce state expenditure. The maintenance and staffing of the property cost 200,000 euro a year. Instead, La Lanterne became the official retreat of the President of France. The fort, however, remained in use as an official retreat of the President of the French Republic.

Pflueger partner. Pflueger, at the time a rising star of San Francisco's architect community, had begun his architectural career with architecture firm, Miller and Colmesnil sometime in 1907, under the tutelage of James Rupert Miller. Together, Miller and Pflueger designed a number of significant buildings in San Francisco, including the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building which was the city's tallest skyscraper for four decades. Architects that worked with the firm include Theodore C. Bernardi, Milton T. Pflueger and Clarence William Whitehead Mayhew. The architectural works featured artistic highlights (such as murals, bas-relief, sculpture) by challenging, new artists and craftsmen such as Ralph Stackpole, Robert Boardman Howard, Charles Stafford Duncan, Dorothy Wright Liebes, Diego Rivera. Rather than breaking new ground with designs, they captured the spirit of the times and refined it, adding a distinct personal flair. Miller retired in 1937; Pflueger reformed the business as Timothy L. Pflueger and Associates.

The Mammal Society was formed in 1954, and the inaugural spring conference took place the following year at The University of Exeter. The Mammal Society has a membership of around 2000 mammalogists, ecologists, conservationists, both experts and enthusiasts, all working to develop greater understanding of mammals and the conservation challenges they face. The Society runs national surveys for mammals, for example Mini Mammal Monitoring. The Mammal Society is also working to address the problem that mammals in the British Isles are severely under-recorded, resulting in a lack of mammal conservation progress. The Mammal Society is determined to overcome this by creating a National Mammal Atlas to provide vital information on mammal distribution and abundance so that informed conservation decisions can be made for species in need. In order to achieve this they are collating national mammal data and records to gather up to date information. The Mammal Society offers a wide range of expert-led training courses for consultants, conservationists and enthusiasts alike, covering ecology, technical skills and surveying. The Society's president is Dr. Paul Chanin, and its current Chair is Prof Fiona Mathews.  Publications  The Mammal Society publishes a number of informative books for conservationists, enthusiasts and consultants alike, as well as a high impact scientific journal, Mammal Review. In June 2012, The Mammal Society published UK BAP Mammals: Interim Guidelines for Survey Methodologies, Impact Assessment & Mitigation for species for which there was previously no available guidance. http://www.nhbs.com/title/view/196556 The definitive publication of The Mammal Society is the 4th edition of Mammals of The British Isles Handbook. The Handbook is well established as the classic reference source detailing the biology, ecology and conservation of every mammal occurring in Britain and Ireland. The 3rd edition, dating to 1991, had long been out of press, until over 100 of the leading mammalogists, mostly members of The Mammal Society, contributed to complete this comprehensive 800-page 4th revision, published in 2008. It presents an authoritative summary of our current knowledge of mammal ecology, biology and conservation issues, with detailed accounts for every species of mammal found in or around the British Isles. http://mammal.org.uk/handbook  References  Category:Biology organizations Category:Conservation in the United Kingdom Category:1954 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Scientific organizations established in 1954 Category:Environmental organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Mammal Society"},{"id":"20333585","text":"Avoca station is a railway station (on the Avoca railway line) in the town of Avoca, Victoria.

The film was directed by Bernard McEveety and written and produced by Andrew J. Fenady, adapted from the story \\"The Night of the Tiger\\" by Al Dewlen. Glenn Yarbrough sang the title song vocals. It was released in January 1966. The budget was an estimated $650,000. Plot A census taker (James MacArthur) arrives in the Texas town of Cold Iron, with a population of 789. He goes into the local bar for a cold beer, and tells the bartender the town has an unusual number of citizens named \\"Jonas\\" and \\"Reprisal.\\" He observes a painting above the bar of a violent street fight, with a gun hanging over it. He is then told of the events behind the fight involving a buffalo hunter named Jonas Trapp and the night the local Mexicans still call \\"The Night of the Reprisal\\" and \\"The Night of the Tiger\\", their name for Jonas. In flashback, we learn that Jonas Trapp (Connors) is a poor cowboy in love with a wealthy woman named Jessie Larkin (Hays). They intend to marry despite the objections of her aunt (Ruth Warrick). The aunt sees Jonas as a man of no prospects and prefers she marry someone more substantial. To gain the aunt's permission, Jessie pretends to be pregnant. Jonas marries her, but is not happy living off his wife's money. Jonas asks Jessie to go to Dodge City with him so they can live independently on what he can earn as a buffalo hunter. Jessie refuses and Jonas leaves, promising to return. He is gone for eleven years and amasses a small fortune of his own. Jessie believe he is dead after a story reaches her that Jonas was killed by a gunfighter, Clay Allison. Jonas is returning home when he stumbles over a campfire and is ambushed by three men: Brooks Durham (Rennie), the local banker; John \\"Johnsy Boy\\" Hood (Bill Bixby), a sadistic young hustler with a love only of fine clothes and himself; and Coates (Claude Akins), a notorious drunk. Coates accuses Jonas of being a cattle rustler and tries to hang him. Durham grabs his rifle and forces Coates to back down, but Coates and Johnsy brand Jonas with a running iron. He is left for dead and Durham takes his money, seventeen thousand dollars. A farmer named Hanley finds Jonas and nurses him back to health. Jonas is consumed by a desire for revenge and heads for Cold Iron, where he learns from his father that Jessie's aunt has died and his wife is now engaged to another man - Brooks Durham. When Jessie encounters him on the street, her only reaction is anger over his abandonment, and fear that his return will spoil her prospects of remarriage. In the course of his remaining in town, Jonas continues hunting for the men who branded him. He takes \\"Johnsy Boy\\" Hood on his way back from romancing the lonely wife of a local farmer (Gloria Grahame) in hopes of cheating her out of some money. Under the threat of being \\"branded and gelded\\" by Jonas, Hood's sanity cracks. He grabs the hot iron and rams it repeatedly into his stomach as he runs screaming into the woods. He later commits suicide. Jonas also encounters the saloon bouncer (Buddy Baer), a giant of a man whom Jonas had met the night before. The bouncer doesn't like it that the town is laughing at him for letting Jonas leave the bar with a bottle of liquor that Jonas promised to pay for later, and now wants the money. The resulting fight presages the subject of the painting seen in the framing sequence, and the bouncer is nearly beaten to death. Only the arrival of Jonas' father stops the fight. Hanley is revealed as one of the rustlers involved with Coates. Coates kills Hanley when the old man denies having Jonas' money. Coates reasons that Durham must have it and tries a little blackmail. Durham threatens to kill Coates, telling him that he used to wear his gun tied to his leg, and he has used it on better men than Coates. But the alcoholic Coates is beyond reasoning. Jonas runs into Durham on the street, the last man on his list, and Durham announces to the town that he branded Jonas like an animal and took his money. He offers to give Jonas his money back but Jonas tells him to go to hell and knocks him down. Coates, who is on a drunken rampage, attacks Jonas. Coates is eventually beaten to a pulp by Jonas, then killed when he goes for his gun. Jonas wants to be done with violence and leaves his gun on the bar. The flashback ends with Jonas mounted up and on his way out of town. Jessie has Jonas' money and pleads with him to stay, but he refuses and the scene ends with her standing in the street as she watches him ride off. His father tells Jessie to go after Jonas. The film ends with the bartender showing off the pistol Jonas left behind. The census taker asks what happened to Jessie. The bartender said she left town and neither she nor Jonas was ever heard from again. The census taker doesn't believe Jessie went after Jonas, but the bartender does, saying that \\"You Can Never Go Home Again\\" is just a song and \\"home\\" is just a word. On the way out of town, the census taker stops to look at Jessie's mansion, now in ruins.

Tremont, Indiana, is a ghost town formerly located in what is now the Indiana Dunes State Park and Indiana Dunes National Park in Westchester Township in northern Porter County, Indiana. It was first established in 1833. It was located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 12 and County Road 100 East, near Indiana 49. The community is named for three massive sand dunes that are now contained within the State park. They are Mount Tom ( above the surrounding area), Mount Holden , and Mount Green .Powell A. Moore; The Calumet Region, Indiana's Last Frontier; Indiana Historical Bureau, 1959, reprinted 1991. History Tremont was originally established as New City West after City West, a settlement on the nearby shore of Lake Michigan that seemed prosperous in the mid-1830s.Bowers, John O. 1929. \\"Dream Cities of the Calumet,\\" in (pp. 174-198) History of Lake County. Volume 10. Gary, Indiana: Lake County Historical Association (Calumet Press). 223 p. City West intended to become a large harbor settlement to rival Chicago, which was a small town at the time and had not yet been incorporated. However, after the Panic of 1837, City West was abandoned, becoming a ghost town without a single resident, and subsequently burnt to the ground. Despite the end of its namesake, New City West still maintained the City West Post Office and City West School. About 20 houses were built in the new city after City West collapsed, and a sawmill, cooper shop, and brickyard were established.Workers of the Writers' Program of the Works Project Administration, 1939. The Calumet Region Historical Guide, p.135. In 1853 the City West Post Office was consolidated with the Calumet Post Office, with D. H. Hopkins as postmaster.Cutler, Harry G. 1912. History of Porter county, Indiana, Volume I. The Alanson Green Tavern became a popular stop for tourists in the 1850s and 60s; they would dine while their stagecoach drivers exchanged horses. During the same period, New City West served as major station in the Underground Railroad. However, in 1875 a boiler explosion destroyed the New City West sawmill. The prosperity of the city ended, and it was largely deserted sometime after 1876. Later, by 1908, New City West became commonly called Tremont due to the establishment of a station by that name on the South Shore Line, an electric interurban railroad line that skirted the heart of the Indiana Dunes and provided Tremont's most important rail service. Because of its adjacency to this railway, descriptions of the history of the Dunes often mention Tremont. For example, the Prairie Club beach house built in 1913 by landscape preservationist Jens Jensen and a group of friends was built in Tremont, close to the rail line.\\"Reading 3: Beauty of the Wild\\", U.S. National Park Service, accessed November 21, 2008. In 1929, \\"scarcely a building of New City West survived\\"; however, new buildings on the site of the old city led to its repopulation as the summer resort town of Tremont. Tremont was always an unincorporated community, but grew to some extent during the early twentieth century and had its own commuter railroad station on the South Shore. The creation of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in the 1960s, and subsequent land condemnation proceedings, caused the remaining community to disperse.

Catton Jr. William Robert Catton Jr. (January 15, 1926 ‚Äì January 5, 2015) was an American sociologist best known for his scholarly work in environmental sociology and human ecology. Catton was known primarily for his 1980 book, Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change. Catton wrote three other books, including From Animistic to Naturalistic Sociology and his 2009 book Bottleneck: Humanity's Impending Impasse. In addition, he has authored numerous scholarly articles, book chapters and book reviews. Biography William Catton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on January 15, 1926. He served in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946. After his military service he enrolled at Oberlin College, where he met Nancy Lewis. The two were married in 1949 and produced four sons, six grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren. Catton graduated from Oberlin College with an A.B. degree in 1950, whereupon he entered the graduate program in sociology at the University of Washington. He earned his M.A. there in 1952 and his Ph.D. in 1954. He was Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Washington State University. Catton served as president of the Pacific Sociological Association 1984-85 and as the first chair of the American Sociological Association Section on Environmental Sociology.All biographical information from the Curriculum Vita of William R. Catton, Jr. Incomplete citation. Catton died on January 5, 2015.  Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change  Overshoot was started during Catton‚Äôs three years in New Zealand, and completed after he returned to the US in 1973 to become Professor of Sociology at Washington State University. Overshoot was not published until 1980. During this period Catton, in collaboration with fellow scholar, Riley Dunlap, produced a series of influential articles on ecological issues. Overshoot continues to be a source of conceptual insight and existential inspiration regarding the ecological basis of human societies, especially to those who see a threat posed by peak oil, climate change, and other ecological pressures Catton either identified or anticipated. Years ahead of its time because of the clarity of formulation of a fully ecological paradigm, the book supplies scientific analysis. Intellectual contribution and critiques Positively, William Catton came of age in sociology when the major debates were about social-only theoretical orientations (structural-functionalism or consensus theory versus Marxism or conflict theory), and methodology (quantitative versus qualitative). However, his inherent attraction to nature and understanding how the earth‚Äôs ecosystems operated afforded him the insight that human social systems including their economies operate within parameters of the natural ecology or they destroy it. Catton‚Äôs primary contribution is the trailblazing articulation of an environmental sociological framework that challenged existing sociological theories in general from a completely different tack: by synthesizing sociological and ecological theory. He argued that the prevalent idea of human control over nature, instead of being a great achievement, might only be a reflection of exploitation of natural resources that were actually finite. To set the tone for his work and the era and intellectual conflicts in which it was published, one of his observations is that, \\"Monumental social changes (and troubles) in the 21st century will be misunderstood (and thus worsened, I believe) insofar as people ... continue interpreting events according to a [pre-ecological] worldview that insufficiently recognizes human society‚Äôs ultimate dependence on its ecosystem context.\\" He originated the formulation of Homo colossus as a quasi-species and detritivore, ecologically distinct from ancestral Homo sapiens.William Catton, Overshoot (1980), p. 170. \\"When the earth's deposits of fossil fuels and mineral resources were being laid down, Homo sapiens had not yet been prepared by evolution to take advantage of them. As soon as technology made it possible for mankind to do so, people eagerly (and without foreseeing the ultimate consequences) shifted to a high-energy way of life. Man became, in effect, a detritivore, Homo colossus. Our species bloomed, and now we must expect a crash (of some sort) as the natural sequel.\\" A notable aspect of Catton's writing is its expansion beyond the specialization silos so often seen in academia and sometimes reflects greater whole-systems understandings of Earth's biospheric life-support machinery than others whose fields of specialization are more narrowly focused. In this respect, Catton advances, by his books in particular, core ecological understandings that are needed by policymakers and sectors of academia whose whole-systems expertise by background and training is otherwise limited. While some would critique his suggestion that past 'Homo sapiens' were different ‚Äî somehow living and evolving in ecological balance, in a scientific sense his suggestions are accurate in that humankind's ability to amplify individual impacts, damages, and wastes by technology has been combined with an ongoing and explosive growth in human numbers. Although this has been questioned in some respects (Boas, 1998, Eco Homo; Redman, 1999, Human Impacts on Ancient Environments) and by historical environmental sociological work (Chew, 2001 World Ecological Degradation, 2007 The Recurring Dark Ages; Whitaker, 2009 Ecological Revolution), it remains significant that all lifeforms ‚Äînot only humans‚Äî, ancient or present, have been involved in processes that degrade the environments upon which they depend. Catton's essential perspectives of natural science are consistent with, and have contributed to a broader understanding of, core carrying capacity as a limiting factor of the natural world as well as other limits and realities of natural ecosystems.

I let my troops execute the President's final order for themselves: I had nothing more to say. But deep in my heart, I silently thanked all of them for their courage, sacrifice, and dedication until the very last minute of the war.

While she was best known for her work as a poet, she was also an accomplished photo journalist, feminist, historian, and politician.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas' inspiration for her writing stemmed from her desire to be an independent woman in a patriarchal world. Her writings‚Äîher poems, articles, novels, and autobiographies‚Äîextend over a period of eighty years, including four marriages, ten years in the Cascade Mountains, and forty years on Cortes Island, British Columbia.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Life Early life Douglas was born on February 1, 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada into a wealthy family.Twigg 2003. She was the only child born to William Murray Douglas, a well-known lawyer in the Toronto area who was eventually appointed Queen's Counsel, and Eleanor (Nellie) Constance Coldham.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas attended private elementary school, took pride in her social background, and loved spending time in the outdoors. By age 5, she could already read, and by age 7, she was a regular contributor to a children's column in the Toronto News She spent much of her childhood vacationing in England, Europe, Canada, and America with her parents.Lebowitz 1998. Her mother died suddenly when she was 7 years old, and her father died from a heart attack when she was 16 years old.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. In her early teenage years, she changed her name from Gillian to Gilean; she decided to avert away from her inherited life of privilege and began doing farm service as a part of the war effort.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. This is when Gilean really started taking interest in the natural world. At age 19, she moved back to Toronto, although its natural environment contributed to her thyroid problems, and began working as a news reporter.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Earning a salary of $25.00/week, she also became an official news reporter and editor of the children's page in the Toronto News.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. At this time, women did not have the right to vote and were overrepresented in fields of nursing and teaching. The First World War era instigated Douglas' interest in issues around gender inequality and women's economic independence. Marriage and career Despite her newfound interest in feminist thought, Douglas married Cecil \\"Slim\\" Rhodes (who adopted her last name) on February 17, 1922.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas, who at this time went under the nickname \\"Bobs,\\" and \\"Slim\\" travelled around the Midwestern United States, staying in various tourist camps.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. It was on this trip that Douglas began taking an interest in photography. Douglas' journal entries reveal that Slim deserted her in 1925, so she returned to Toronto and began travelling around the Great Lakes researching the shipping conditions of the big freighters.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. For the two years that she was a journalist in this area, she also travelled around northern Ontario to camp, canoe, hunt, and ski with friends.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas continued her writing career and got involved with the YWCA when she moved to Reno, Nevada in 1928.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. In July 1929, she remarried a man named Charles Norman Haldenby, who fled on their wedding night after \\"Slim\\" erratically showed up.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas' third marriage, to a chemical engineer, Eric Altherr, lasted 3 years, until both parties became involved with other people.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. She suffered her first and only miscarriage in 1934.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas' thirties were prolific years for writing poetry, especially about love, unreciprocated love, rejection, and the problems with marriage; however, the start of the Second World War marked a time of financial distress for Douglas. She decided to move into a cabin on the Coquihalla River on the west coast of British Columbia.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. She continued to write, under the pseudonym Grant Madison, with the inspiration for her writing stemming from being in the wilderness and working in her garden.Milton 1999. Occasionally, she would travel to Vancouver to visit friends and conduct research and business; thus, she was not isolated in this small town. In 1939, Gilean purchased property in the Cascade Mountains.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. She began engaging in scientific observation studies of flowers, plants, animals, and geography in order to emphasize their aesthetic and spiritual value in her writing. Regrettably, in 1947, a fire destroyed her cabin, where she spent the seven happiest years of her life.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Left with virtually nothing, Douglas was forced to move. She ended up on Keats Island, just northwest of Vancouver, met a man named Philip Major, whom she married on June 1, 1949, and bought property in Whaletown on Cortes Island.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Her involvement with the Women's Auxiliary to the Anglican Church, the Whaletown Community Club, and the Women's Institute, which advocated for local improvement on women's education, led to her separation and divorce from her fourth and final husband in the early 1950s.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas never had any children.Lebowitz 1998. Her new role as a weather observer for Environment Canada, along with her interest in conducting research on remote settlements of coastal British Columbia, forced her to step down from her administrative position with the Women's Institute in 1960.Milton 1999. From 1973-1978, she acted as the director of the Advistory Planning Commission and the Environmental Committee for the Comox-Strathcona Regional District; her role involved the regulation of land use (zoning, pollution and waste management, and transportation), the preservation of wetlands, and salmon habitat enhancement.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. For 31 years (1961‚Äì1992), Douglas had a column in the Victoria Daily Colonist called Nature Rambles.Milton 1999. Later life and death Douglas struggled with a lifelong thyroid problem but refused surgery all through her life. In 1992, she became increasingly sick and was advised to sell her property on Cortes Island; however, she refused any offers on her cabin and at the same time, refused old age pension.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. In 1993, she was airlifted to the hospital in Campbell River but recovered and returned to her home on Cortes Island where she died, surrounded by friends and loved ones, on October 31, 1993.Milton 1999. Douglas and the environment Douglas lived to be ninety-three and accomplished a lot as a journalist, a historian, a feminist, and a nature writer.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. The themes embedded in her writings and her photographs were fundamentally linked to her experiences with nature and the wilderness; her love for nature and her love for writing are thus intertwined. Douglas‚Äô sense of place, home, and spirituality was essentially embedded in her natural surroundings‚Äîfrom the Cascade Mountains to Cortes Island. Like many other nature writers, Douglas maintained the duality of losing herself in the natural world in order to uncover a stronger sense of being. Throughout her life, she wrote about her connection with all things natural, including plants, animals, and geographical entities.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Her writing conveys the notion that humans do not have ownership over the land but rather a responsibility to respect and care for it. Her central philosophy was that humans would be able to discover a sense of being and belonging if they balanced their needs with the needs of the natural world.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas was writing at a time when environmental concerns, including issues of preservation, restoration, and sustainability, were not heavily recognized or supported in society. She wanted to raise awareness about destructive land use, which was destroying the very environment that attracted other people to her home‚Äîin particular, Cortes Island.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. Douglas never wrote about her hardship and affliction of living in the wilderness; she was more so concerned with the future destruction of her environment. Her academic, recreational, and occupational positions‚Äîfrom a weather observer to a photojournalist to a wilds adventurer‚Äîwere deeply involved with nature in some way or another. Her work with Environment Canada, the Comox-Strathcona Regional District, and the YWCA were efforts to motivate an environmental movement and instigate concern for the natural world.Lebowitz & Milton 1999. For a large part of her life, Douglas lived alone. She understood her solitude as something that could inspire love and devotion to nature‚Äînot only for herself, but for society as a whole.

He was on squad for Portugal when it won the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, scoring the opener in the final against Nigeria (2‚Äì0).

Origin and spread Chrysanthemum white rust (CWR) was first identified in Japan, although it is now established throughout Asia, Europe, South America.Data Sheets on Quarantine Pests . European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization. Retrieved on 2008-11-21. It has been found in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand on several occasions, but early detection and eradication efforts have prevented the disease from becoming established in these countries.Invasive and Emerging Fungal Pathogens - Diagnostic Fact Sheets . Hern√°ndez, J.R. Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory, ARS, USDA. 2004. Retrieved on 2008-11-21. Disease cycle Puccinia horiana is a microcyclic, autoecious rust, meaning that the fungus has two known spore stages: teliospores and basidiospores, as well as no known alternate host. Similar to other microcyclic rusts, two-celled teliospores produce unicellular basidiospores which are then dispersed via air currents. Under a laboratory setting, it has been shown to both spores need high humidity (50-90% RH) and a thin layer of water to germinate. This rust is susceptible to desiccation and has been shown to lose viability in drier climates. Due to this trait, chrysanthemum white rust is more likely to be spread via greenhouse contamination than by air, such as by human contact, improper sanitation techniques, or by keeping a constant high humidity to keep the spores viable. Symptoms Plants infected by chrysanthemum white rust exhibit spots on the upper surfaces of leaves. These spots are initially pale-green to yellow in color and up to 5mm in diameter, but may turn brown as the tissue becomes necrotic. On the underside of the leaf, the spots develop into pink or white pustules that become prominent as the teliospores develop. Economic importance Due to the popularity of chrysanthemums as an ornamental flower, there has been a large effort in preventing spread of CWR. In the United States CWR is a quarantine significant pest, according to the US department of agriculture. Importation of certain Chrysanthemum species are prohibited from several countries due to the potential of P. horiana to be transported with these prohibited hosts. According to APHIS, best management practices include the use of proper cultural techniques, disease scouting, sanitation, fungicide applications, and worker training. While difficult to measure current total economic loss caused by the disease, at peak infection seasons, it has been shown that Turkey and Poland experience anywhere from 80% to 100% crop loss, which is significant as they are the top producers of Chrysanthemums. Pathogenesis Similar to most rusts, CWR has 4 stages of infection: (i) Basidospore lands on susceptible plant. Development of germ tube and infection peg begins. (ii) Formation of small vesicles inside the host epidermis. (iii) Formation of elongated fungal vesicles inside the host epidermis (iv) Formation of septate fungal vesicles with branching hyphae. Here the fungus will move to infect the rest of the plant. Infection of CWR is systemic. By creating such a systemic infection, P. horiana has the potential to overwinter in plants as a form of protection . Like previously stated, sanitation is the best preventive for CRW. However, Propiconazole has been shown to be an effective fungistatic. Propiconazole's mode of action blocks the biosynthesis of ergosterols, which is critical to the formation of cell walls of fungi. This stops the growth of the fungus, effectively preventing further infection and/or invasion of host tissues See also * List of Puccinia species References  External links  * Species Profile - Chrysanthemum White Rust (Puccinia horiana), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

As of Spring 2013 Yaldah has almost 3000 subscribers worldwide in the US, Canada, England, Israel, Australia, Spain, China as well as other countries and an editorial board of 19 girls from all over the US and Canada. History In 2004, Leah Caras (then Larson) published the first issue of Yaldah at the age of 13 as a way to connect Jewish girls around the world. It was published on a quarterly magazine. The magazine became more and more widely known, and different types of publications, Jewish and non-Jewish, started requesting interviews and began to publish an enormous number of articles. This helped spread the word about the magazine. Leah Larson could not do the entire magazine on her own, especially as she was beginning to have more personal responsibilities, and in 2005, Yaldah formed their first editorial board with 13 girls, whose jobs consisted of writers, illustrators, photographers, and Q&A; editors. In 2006, another editorial board was formed, and the first Jewish Girls Retreat was attended by over 50 girls. Along with winning many other awards, in 2008, Leah Larson won $100,000 as a first place Wells Fargo Someday Stories winner. Throughout this time, many advertising campaigns were launched including the Real Readers Campaign, 10Friends, Project 2010, and more.

Hall's 1923 recording of it was a hit in the US and also in Britain, where it was sung during the 1925 FA Cup final by Sheffield United supporters, making it a popular football song of the era. This song is an example of the folk tradition of transmission with local variants. Antecedents from the 19th century are known. Carl Sandburg suggested that the song goes back at least to the 1870s and includes verses in his American Songbag (1927). By the 1920s many variants were already extant in popular culture. Mr. Hall most likely codified what already existed and added original verses. The song may be somewhat familiar to modern listeners because of its use in a number of films, especially vintage animated cartoons, typically in the form of a brief vocal refrain or as an instrumental musical comment. It is featured at the end of a 1930 Path√© Studios cartoon titled Noah Knew His Ark, and part of it is sung in The Plumber, a 1933 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon.

Only one species is recorded, Eileanchelys waldmani. It is the best-represented turtle from the Middle Jurassic, because of the amount of specimens that can be assigned to it. The turtle is also one of the oldest turtles ever found to be aquatic, and might represent a milestone in turtle evolution. Discovery and naming In 2009, two specimens from the National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh, including NMS G 2004.31.15 and NMS G 2004.31.16a‚Äìf, were found to differ from other turtles from the area and age. It was decided that they represented a new genus and species, and were named Eileanchelys waldmani by J√©r√©my Anquetin and his colleagues. The specimen NMS G 2004.31.15 was designated as the holotype, and NMS G 2004.31.16a-f, the paratypes. NMS G 2004.31.16 includes at least five, and possibly six, different individuals, all in one block. The holotype of Eileanchelys is a partial skull. Both blocks were found in Cladach a'Ghlinne, Scotland. Etymology Eileanchelys waldmani was named and described by Anquetin et al. in 2009. The generic name, eilean, comes from the Scottish Gaelic word for island, and chelys, from the Greek word for turtle. The species was named in honour of Dr. Michael Waldman who found its remains, as well as the first Scottish Jurassic mammal, after rediscovering the Cladach a'Ghlinne locality. Description Eileanchelys is a small turtle, with an approximate carapace length of . The preserved carapaces of Eileanchelys are all slightly crushed, but show that they were lightly domed in real life. Therefore, the morphology of its shell was similar to Kayentachelys. There is a fused connection of the carapace and plastron in Eileanchelys. The connection is not found in Heckerochelys, but is in Kayentachelys. Distinguishing characteristics Eileanchelys is characterized by the following features: the presence of nasal; elongated postorbital skull; absence of flooring of the cavum acustico-jugulare; processus interfenestralis of the opisthotic more slender than that of more basal forms but more robust than that of crown-group turtles; separate openings of the canalis cavernosum and canalis stapedio-temporalis present within the cavum acustico-jugulare; a reduced thickness of the basicranium floor comparable with that of crown-group turtles; well-developed antrum postoticum; flat and horizontal vomer that is free of contacts for most of its length except at its extremities and along a short suture with the prefrontal; absence of processus trochlearis oticum; posteroventrally open incisura columellae auris; at least eight neurals (an additional plate between neural 8 and suprapygal 1 may be a ninth neural or a supernumerary suprapygal), two broad suprapygals, and eight costals present; absence of carapacial or plastral fontanelle in adult individuals; one short but broad cervical scute present; vertebral scutes wider than pleurals; vertebral 3‚Äì4 sulcus on neural 6; reduced cleithrum present; arrow-shaped entoplastron that does not separate the epiplastra anteriorly; one pair of mesoplastra that meet medially; one small pair of extragulars present; and anal scute that does not reach the hypoplastron. Classification Eileanchelys is a stable taxon, which means that its classification does not differ much in cladograms. It is related to both Heckerochelys and Kayentachelys, although often it is found to be derived from the later. The below cladogram illustrates the relationships of basal testudinata: Paleoecology Habitat Eileanchelys lived in the Kilmaluag Formation, which has a Late Bathonian age. The formation is made up entirely of mudstone, shale and some limestone, and, as many aquatic types of animals have been found in it and land vertebrates are rare, it was almost certainly marine. Therefore, Eileanchelys was most likely was an aquatic turtle, swimming throughout lagoons and lakes, rather than terrestrial animal that died in a body of water. It is therefore one of the oldest, and best known, extinct aquatic turtles, and might represent a new evolutionary stage of turtle. Fauna Eileanchelys existed in the Kilmaluag Formation of the Great Estuarine Group. This formation has an abundance of tetrapod fauna, including salamanders; the choristodere Cteniogenys sp.; crocodilians; the lepidosauromorph Marmoretta sp.; various lizards; pterosaurs; dinosaurs; the synapsid Stereognathus hebridicus; and early mammals.

He was capped by the county in 1980. He played football in the winters as a centre-half for Stourbridge F.C. Born at Wall Heath, Kingswinford, Staffordshire, he was educated at Summerhill Secondary Modern School.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. After playing club cricket first for Himley, then in the Birmingham League for Stourbridge, he was offered a trial by Worcestershire. He made his first-class debut against Cambridge University at Fenner's in May 1972, though he had an unsuccessful match, taking no wickets and not batting in either innings. He had to wait until the middle of July to play again, bowling Barry Dudleston of Leicestershire to claim the first wicket of his career. Pridgeon was given only occasional opportunities for the next three seasons, but in 1976 things turned his way: Brian Brain and Keith Wilkinson left the club, while Jim Cumbes spent the summer in the United States playing football. Pridgeon was rarely out of the first team during that famously hot summer. Indeed, his 1,200 deliveries in List A cricket were the most he sent down in any one season. In late May he claimed what was to remain his career- best bowling return in taking 7/35 against Oxford University, three further successes in the second innings bringing him his only ten-wicket match haul. He dropped out of the side after the first half of 1977, but returned to play a full part in the 1978 season. In late July of that year, he achieved his best bowling performance in a one-day match, taking 6/26 against Surrey in the John Player League. At the time, this was the second-best return for Worcestershire in a List A game (behind Jack Flavell's 6/14 against Lancashire in 1963). However, in 1979 he was once again mainly a Second XI player. From 1980, when he was capped, until 1984 Pridgeon commanded a regular place in the Worcestershire side. In 1983 he took 72 first-class wickets, the most he would manage in a single summer; he also topped 50 in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986. In 1984 he made his one half-century, hitting 67 against Warwickshire. However in 1985 his fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse. Neal Radford had arrived from Lancashire, and he and Phil Newport were ahead of Pridgeon in the pecking order; he ended up playing just one first-class match (and that against Cambridge University) and no List A games at all. Pridgeon bounced back in 1986 to play a full part in the season, but although he took a County Championship best of 7/44 against Leicestershire in 1987, his appearances gradually diminished as his career began to wind down. He did, however, take part in the county's Championship-winning seasons of 1988 and 1989, and in 1988 he took 30 List A wickets, his most of any year. In 1989, his final season of first-class cricket, he was awarded a benefit season in the latter year, which raised ¬£154,720. On leaving Worcestershire, Pridgeon took up a coaching role at Shrewsbury School. However, he continued to play cricket, turning out for Shropshire in 1991 and 1992. In June 1991 he made his sole List A appearance for them, playing (though taking no wickets) against Leicestershire in the NatWest Trophy.

United States The US Safe Drinking Water Act and derivative legislation define \\"public water system\\" as an entity that provides \\"water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year.\\" The term \\"public\\" in \\"public water system\\" refers to the people drinking the water, not to the ownership of the system. Some US states (e.g. New York) have varying definitions. Over 286 million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. Eight percent of the community water systems‚Äîlarge municipal water systems‚Äîprovide water to 82 percent of the US population. Subcategorization The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined three types of public water systems: * Community Water System (CWS). A public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round. * Non-Transient Non- Community Water System (NTNCWS). A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and hospitals which have their own water systems. * Transient Non-Community Water System (TNCWS). A public water system that provides water in a place such as a gas station or campground where people do not remain for long periods of time. There are over 150,000 public water systems. * Approximately 52,000 CWS serve the majority of the U.S. population * Approximately 85,000 NTNCWS * Approximately 18,000 TNCWS. EPA also classifies water systems according to the number of people they serve: * Very Small water systems serve 25-500 people * Small water systems serve 501-3,300 people * Medium water systems serve 3,301-10,000 people * Large water systems serve 10,001-100,000 people * Very Large water systems serve over 100,000 people. Water systems may be categorized by their source of water: *Groundwater, generally from wells *Surface water and groundwater \\"under the influence\\" of surface water *Purchase of water from another Public Water System. Water-related diseases and contaminants in public water systems Sources of drinking water are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing contaminants. Contamination of drinking water supplies can occur in the source water as well as in the distribution system after water treatment has already occurred. There are many sources of water contamination, including naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (application of fertilizers and pesticides; concentrated animal feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.

Trains stopping at Manor Park run to Wellington and Upper Hutt. The station has an island platform between two tracks. The station is one of only three Hutt valley line stations west of Te Awa Kairangi/Hutt River, the others being the Petone and Ava railway stations.  History  In 1954 the Hutt Valley Branch became the main line, and the Melling-Haywards section was closed, with the western part of the old line becoming the single-track Melling Branch. A new station was erected at Haywards (now called Manor Park) where the new line from Pomare joined the existing line north. The old Haywards railway station had been opened (with Belmont railway station) on 15 December 1875.Hoy, D.G.

The lamellorthoceratids are placed in the superfamily Orthocerataceae in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (Walter Sweet, 1964). Lamellorthoceratids are distinguished by cameral deposits consisting of simple or bifurcating epispetal, or rarely hyposeptal lamellae, set radially with respect to the siphuncle; often filling the entire posterior part of the shell. Lamellorthoceratid shells are straight or slightly endogastric with a slender, cylindrical subcentral orthochoanitic siphuncle, free or organic deposits. The Lamellorthoceratidae are known from the Lower and Middle Devonian and possibly from the Lower Carboniferous, and is represented by three genera. Genera *Lamellorthoceras, a lamellorthoceriatid from the lower and middle Devonian of North Africa (Algeria, Morocco) characterized by radial lamellae that tend to be wavy, twisted, or to have bifurcating inner edges. All chambes may be filled. Otherwise the genus is similar to Arthrophyllum (below). Lamellorthoceras was named and described by Termier & Termier in 1950. *Arthrophyllum has slender, gradually expanding orthocones or faintly endogastic longicones, the surfaces of which are covered with close spaced sinuous transverse crenulations that form broad dorsal and ventral salients and lateral sinuses. Septa are shallow, sutures straight and transverse. Camerae contain episeptal deposits formed by longitudinal lamellae that radiate inwardly from the chamber walls and increase in bulk adapically so as to completely fill the entire apical chambers. Arthrophyllum was named and described by Beyrich in 1850 and is known from the Lower Devonian of Europe (France, Germany, Turkey). Tentative specimens are known from the Lower Carboniferous. *Gorgonoceras is similar to Arthrophyllum except that the surface has faint longitudinal ribs, the eccentric siphuncle has a continuous endsiphuncular lining on the ventral side, and there is a ventral lamella that is much thicker than the other. Gorgonoceras is known from the Eifelian of the Sverlovsk district in Russia and was named and described by Zhuravleva in 1961.

Little is known about the flag's early history but it may have originated as far back as 1850 when the formation of the Murray River League was announced. R. W. Beddome, founder of the League, enthused \\"Up with the Murray flag.\\" No fragments of the original Murray River Flag are known to exist and three variants have passed down to the present day.  History  The earliest recorded reference to the Murray River Flag was at Goolwa to honour the first paddlesteamer to go into service on the Murray River. The Mary Ann, built by three brothers William, Thomas and Elliot Randell, began her voyage from Mannum downstream to Goolwa on 4 March 1853. The Murray River Flag was hoisted upon their arrival. The flag was described by a reporter of the Australian Register: > \\"The flag bears a red cross with four horizontal blue bars. The cross being > charged with five stars as emblems of the Colonies while the upper corner, > is taken up with British connections which is depicted by the Union Jack. It > has been named, we understand, the Murray River Flag.\\" It is believed that the blue bars represent the Murray River and the three major rivers that run into it: the Murrumbidgee, Lachlan and the Darling. The design bears a strong resemblance to other Australian flags of the 19th Century, such as the Australian Federation Flag and the National Colonial Flag for Australia.  Modern Usage  The Upper Murray flag flying above the historic Tintaldra Hotel, Tintaldra, Victoria.(2008) Today the Murray River is represented by three flags, each flag similar but based on different interpretations of the original description. The Upper Murray Flag has darker blue bands on its flag, representing the darker waters of the river's upper reaches. This design was also the house flag of the Murray River Steam Navigation Co. which suggests that it is a lineal descendant of the original flag design. The Lower Murray Flag, used predominantly in South Australia, is distinguished by the use of pale blue bands representing the lighter coloured water of the lower reaches of the Murray. A third variant, the Combined Murray Flag, is used on the upper reaches of the Murray in New South Wales.

Here the grazing of Lacaune, Manech, and Basco-B√©arnaise for the production of Roquefort occurs alongside the growing of Grenache, Syrah, and Mouvedre for Terrasses du Larzac wine.3\\\\. http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?ID_TEXTE_CONSOLIDE=791  Production zone  The Terrasses de Larzac area is in the north of the H√©rault department. It is in an asymmetrical V shape crossed by the north- south flowing H√©rault River. The Causse du Larzac runs along the entire northern boundary. To the west it stretches along the Lergue river bed, whilst to the north-east it stretches along the sides of the S√©ranne mountains, along the Bu√®ges valley. Mount Saint Baudille rises from the centre in the first foothills of the Larzac. At the foot of the Causse du Larzac there are a succession of old terraces at around 50 metres (165 ft) above the H√©rault and Lergue rivers. Whereas some slopes which form a natural boundary for the Terrasses du Larzac do rise to over 800 metres (2650 ft), the areas under vines and classed as AOC Coteaux du Languedoc range from 50 ‚Äì 300 metres (165 ‚Äì 990 ft) up the slopes of the Causse and on the old terraces. The climate zone with the widest temperature variations in the region, it enjoys relatively cool summer nights thanks to its distance from the sea and proximity to the mountainous Causse. As a result the grapes mature slowly and steadily which is beneficial both to their colour and the wines‚Äô aromatic qualities.4.www.terrasses-du-larzac.com  Villages  Aniane, Arboras, Le Bosc, Brissac, Causse-de-la-Selle, Ceyras, Gignac (part), Jonqui√®res, Lagamas, Lauroux, M√©rifons, Montoulieu, Montpeyroux, Moul√®s-et-Baucels, Murles, Octon, P√©gairolles-de-Bu√®ges, P√©gairolles-de-l'Escalette, Poujols, Pu√©chabon, Saint- Andr√©-de-Sangonis, Saint-Andr√©-de-Bu√®ges, Saint-F√©lix-de-Lodez, Saint-Guiraud, Saint-Jean-de-Bu√®ges, Saint-Jean-de-Fos, Saint-Jean-de-la-Blaqui√®re, Saint- Privat, Saint-Saturnin-de-Lucian, Soub√®s, Usclas-du-Bosc.5.www.terrasses-du- larzac.com  Soils and Climate  Sandy, stony soils, red ruffes in horizontal layers: limestone marl with overhanging cliffs of Jurassic limestone.

Of the 168 regional communes, 32 may produce Terrasses du Larzac wine. The Appellation is for red wines only. A blend of at least two grape varieties is obligatory including the Grape varieties of Syrah, Grenache, and Mourv√®dre (60% minimum) with Syrah, Grenache or Mourv√®dre limited individually to 75% and Syrah and /or Mourv√®dre 20% minimum, Cinsault and Carignan (30% maximum).

Vines must be planted at 4000 plants per hectare with a maximum distance between rows of 2.50 metres, pruned short at no more than ten renewal shoots per plant, and no vines under their 5th year may be used.7.http://www.terrasses-du-larzac.com  History  The Romans first planted vines in the Terrasses du Larzac area. The land around Lod√®ve had great appeal, stretching as it did along the busy Roman road which linked Cessero (St Thib√©ry) with Segodunum (Rodez).8.http://www.terrasses-du-larzac.com Benedictine period The foundation of the Monastery of Aniane in 782, the main of the European Benedictine order lead the reintroduction of vines to the vast unoccupied hinterland in the area around Clermont l‚ÄôH√©rault and Lod√®ve. The influence of the Benedictine monks of Aniane and Saint-Guilhem-le-D√©sert, evidenced by the number of Romanesque churches and priories stretching up to the Bu√®ges valley, was accompanied by the growing of vines on terraces overlooking the Bu√®ges valley and the production of wine made in the cellars of Benedictine priories founded by the Abbey of Saint-Guilhem-le-D√©sert in the 10th and 11th centuries. Local producers emerged later, using glazed stone vats blocks for vinification in vaulted cellars of village houses.9.http://www.terrasses-du-larzac.com The 16th-19th century From 16th century onwards, the landowners authorized the clearing of scrubland in the foothills to allow vines, olives and almond trees to be planted, frequently on stone-covered terraces (faysses.) In the 17-18th century, the growth of eau de vie production brought a greater prosperity to grape growers leading to the establishment of a distillery in most villages. Development of trade with those living in the Massif Central (who exchanged metal from local mines, meat, milk and cereals for wine, as well as dried fish and spices from the coast) lead to Montpeyroux becoming an important trade centre. Later Pas de l‚ÄôEscalette above Lod√®ve came into being, and the landscape around P√©gairolles de l‚ÄôEscalette is covered with little horizontal stone walls dug into the vertical, rocky hillsides as well as the construction of ‚Äòcapitelles‚Äô (stone huts) where grape producers or shepherds could store material and shelter where a long way from home. The Marly decree in 1770 allowed for greater land clearance, with the vineyard planted on the garrigue and allowed for the production of wine to become a serious economic activity.10.http://www.terrasses-du-larzac.com 19th-20th century Disaster struck in 1850. First o√Ødium, then phylloxera. As throughout much of France, the vines of the region were almost totally destroyed with most producers choosing to dig up older vines and replant grafting onto American root stock.11.http://www.terrasses-du-larzac.com Late 20th century Pioneers such as Aim√© Guibert - Mas de Daumas Gassac (Aniane) in 1974 and Olivier Jullien - Mas Jullien (Jonquieres) in 1985, and later Laurent Vaille - Domaine de la Grange des P√®res (Aniane) in 1992 led the way to a rediscovery of quality growing in the region inspiring countless other growers and interest from foreign investors such as Robert Mondavi, whose wish to make ‚Äòone of the world's finest wines‚Äô in the appellation‚Äôs Massif de l'Arboussas is well documented.12.New York Times, Mondavi's Battle Royal, July 19, 2000 In 2008, Andrew Jefford (Author of The New France) wrote of the appellation: > \\"Where is the greatest terroir in Languedoc?

Today it is a standard gauge branch line connecting the Western SG with Bung Bong (ballast) and Dunolly (grain), running through Maryborough station.  History  The first section of line was opened as a branch from Maryborough to Avoca in October 1874, 24 kilometres in length, then was extended 62.8 kilometres to Ararat in November 1890, forming a through route between two main lines. In July 1959 the line between Avoca and Ararat was closed. In October 1966 the line was reopened, and in 1996 it was converted to standard gauge, along with the main Melbourne‚ÄìAdelaide railway. The Avoca‚ÄìArarat section of the line has been unused for a number of years and Pacific National used it to store over 100 surplus grain wagons, until many of them were reactivated to carry the 2011‚Äì2012 harvest. Upgrade The line is to be reopened (as of 2017) as standard gauge and upgraded to 21-tonne axle loads, with insertion of over 100,000 new concrete sleepers. The second reopening of this cross-country line is primarily to allow for the carriage of mineral sands from Manangatang to a processing plant at Hamilton. The reopening project includes the provision of a direct standard gauge connection between the Avoca and Hamilton lines at Ararat to avoid the need for trains to have to reverse at Ararat. It was announced in June 2017 that work will begin to reopen the 87 km line between Maryborough and Ararat.

The Chamba are located between present day Nigeria and Cameroon. The closest Chamba neighbours are the Mumuye, the Fulani and the Jukun and Kutep people. In Cameroon, the successors of Leko and chamba speakers are divided into several states: Bali Nyonga, Bali Kumbat, Bali-Gham, Bali-Gangsin, and Bali- Gashu. The Basari people of Togo and Ghana also go by the name Chamba, but they are ethnically distinct. The Chamba are identified through their own language, beliefs, culture, and art.  Language  The Chamba people, also known as Samba, Tchamba, Tsamba, Daka and Chamba-Ndagan, are an African ethnic group found in the Gongola State of east-central Nigeria and neighboring parts of north Cameroon. They speak two distantly related languages: Chamba Leko, of the Leko‚ÄìNimbari languages, and Chamba Daka, of the Dakoid languages, both of which are a Niger-Congo language.; Richard Fardon, Raiders & refugees: trends in Chamba political development, 1750-1950 Boyd says that the ‚ÄúChamba Leko speakers are restricted to the easternmost part of the central area, for the most part on the Cameroon part of the modern border. The remainder of the Chamba are Daka-speaking‚Äù. The Chamba speakers still speak various other dialects that are different from place to place. The central area is where the Chamba Daka (Sama Nnakenyare) live. That area is found in North east of Nigeria on the Cameroon border in Adamawa State. Germany was the original colonial power that annexed the Chambaland, but when Germany lost the First World War, this territory in Africa was divided by the League of Nations between British and France.  Beliefs  The Chamba people have their own particular religious beliefs.Chamba Religion The traditional religion of the Chamba is premised on a creator solar God (Su) and ancestor spirits who live with this creator. The sun god does not interact with living beings, but the ancestor spirits do. The dead (wurumbu) are believed to continue living, but they live below the ground. They follow the same style and sophistication as humans, but they are believed to be wiser and with supernatural power. Special people among the Chamba are believed to be able to interact with these ancestral spirits and they are revered by the Chamba people. The Chamba people were one of the targets of Fulani jihads in the 18th and 19th century. They were enslaved, and many migrated south into the mountains. They retaliated by becoming raiding bands who attacked slave and trading caravans.RICHARD FARDON (1983), A CHRONOLOGY OF PRE-COLONIAL CHAMBA HISTORY, Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Bd. 29 (1983), pages 67-92 A minority, or about 15%, of the Chamba people adhere to Islam.  Society and Culture  The Chamba traditionally live in grassland areas, farming cereal staples, and cash crops such as cocoa and coffee. One main crop that the Chamba farm is guinea corn. The Chamba are composed of different clans that can have varying styles of chiefdoms. Some are led by women, men, or both. These clans work based on the collective belief in \\"the authoritative masculinity of relatively older men and women.\\" The Chamba live in villages. Outside of the villages is an uninhabited forest region called the bush. The areas of the bush closest to the village are places that the Chamba collect materials for building fires, making utilitarian objects like baskets and mats, hunting, and gathering. These areas of the bush are accessed both by men and women. The inner bush is considered more dangerous and associated with the male gender.  Cults  One form of Chamba social control is through the use of cults. Chamba Daka refer to cults as jup. Each jup is connected with misfortune or disease. These cults can control these misfortunes and cure diseases based on how the members perform rituals and make payments. Each jup is individualized and runs uniquely based on their own rules and practices. There are both men's and women's cults that an individual may only gain membership through an initiation process. Cult members are expected to keep the rituals, rites, and practices secret. Membership in cults can provide protection and security from misfortunes and illnesses. Initiation processes are different for each gender's cult. Circumcision is a part of the men's cult initiation, through which the process allows boys to enter into manhood. For women, their marker of transition into womanhood is not through initiation but marriage. Often, women do not join cults until they are married. For women's cults, sometimes tooth evulsion is part of initiation. However, tooth evulsion is less practiced now and varies by region and particular group.  Art  They are skilled artists known for their pottery, metalwork and sculpture. In addition, the Chamba make masks that are performed at special occasions. An example of the bushcow mask and costume. = Masking Tradition = Masks representing the wild are typically composed of a wooden mask and a costume made of long fibers. The complete look is supposed to give the illusion of one complete entity with the mask, costume, and performer becoming a single unit. One specific type of mask is called a buffalo or bushcow mask. Each clan of the Chamba usually has at least one bushcow mask. These masks are painted different colors to determine whether the mask is male or female. Some clans will have both a female and male bushcow mask. The features of the mask are composed of both animal and human attributes. The horns of the bushcow mask refer to the \\"female bushcow ancestor.\\" The mouth is often compared to that of a crocodile. These masks are supposed to represent the power of the bush. The masks function in conjunction with Chamba events like circumcision, initiation of chiefs, and funerals. These masks are stored in the bush. When they perform for special occasions, the masks leave the bush and enter into the village. During performances, the masquerader will dance. Some liken the style of dance to that of a buffalo charging. alt= = Statues = A double figure volumetric wooden statue. Chamba statues are figural, usually depicting a male, a female, or both a male and female. The figures usually appear in a single form or a double form in which two figures are attached to a base. These statues are typically made of wood or iron. These statues have been divided into two categories based on their visual form. The first group is characterized by its volume. These statues often carved from a single piece of wood. The arms have bent arms and crouching legs. The arms come away from the body. One interpretation of these poses is that the figures may be dancing. In volumetric double form statues, two upper bodies share one pair of legs. The second group is characterized by its column-like form. The figure's arms and legs are attached to the body. Some of these statues were thought to be used in cult rituals. The function of these statues is widely unknown. The little records of what the function may be have come from a few ethnologists during the colonial-period. Notable people *Gen. Theophilus Y.

It was situated on the current territory of the city of Alexandrov, Vladimir Oblast.  History  Alexandrovskaya village dates back to the middle of the 14th century. Grand Duke Vasily III had a country palace built there and used to bring his family and the entire court to it. The palace did not survive. The Pokrovsky (Intercession of the Virgin) cathedral was sanctified in 1513 and later it was blessed anew as the Trinity (Troitsky) Cathedral. Its appearance has changed somewhat since the 16th century; some of the architectural details such as windows, e.g., belong to a later period. Originally, red brick and white stone were used in the outer decoration of the cathedral but brick parts were later painted over. Some of the interior fresco paintings date back to the 14th century as do the white stone carvings in the interior portals. Ivan the Terrible moved to the Alexandrovskaya fortress in 1565. The residence was immediately fortified with a bulwark, wooden walls, and a moat. The village became the actual capital of the country. The oprichnina was founded there and the march on the Novgorod Republic started from the village. As Novgorod was looted Ivan brought the famous gates of its Saint Sophia Cathedral (1336) to the village and had them installed at the southern entrance of the Assumption (Trinity) cathedral. The gates combine religious and fantastic subjects; there is, for instance, the image of a centaur. The gates were made with the use of the old technique in which the door was first carved and then rubbed with a mixture of liquid gold and mercury. The western entrance was embellished with the old (1344-1358) doors that Ivan had removed from the Transfiguration (Spaso-Preobrazhensky) church in Tver. An etched picture of the Holy Trinity is still preserved on one of the doors. The Alexandovsky Kremlin was also the place where the tsar received ambassadors from many countries of Europe, such as Sweden, Denmark, Austria, England, and Rzeczpospolita. The tsar left the fortress in 1581 and never returned there again. The Assumption (Uspensky) nunnery was opened on its territory in the second half of the 17th century. During Soviet times the fortress and the former nunnery were used as a museum. At present, the territory of the Kremlin is shared by a museum and the revived nunnery.

One of the parishioners contacted Wright, the architect, to inquire about designing a building. Mr. Wright responded to the proposal in January 1958 with these words: \\"Tell the people of the little church that I will help them out. If I like the ‚Äòfeel‚Äô of a job, I take it.\\" This church is one of Wright's last designs and the last church designed by Wright before he died in 1959. Referring to the church's design, Wright once said, \\"this little church\\" was designed as a \\"Pole and Boulder Gothic\\". The design was to represent the form of a tent, the ancient dwelling of Israel, as a symbol of temporary, migratory and transient lives. Wright died before he could finish all the drawings for the church. Unable to secure a bid within their budget, the congregation's building committee voted to build the church themselves. With oversight from Wright's successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects, excavation began in June, 1960. With its massive desert rubblestone walls and the 23 giant steel and concrete roof supports that envelop the building, the church seems almost to grow out of the rocky hillside setting. The pulpit area was designed to resemble a cave. The building was dedicated in 1963. The full plans of the multi-building design are yet to be realized. There is a fireplace in the fellowship hall, which is used as the sanctuary. This wing was to extend into the middle of today‚Äôs parking lot where it would intersect the real, 300 seat sanctuary, 100 seat chapel wing, and 17 classroom church school wing - all in a triangular fashion. This central core would have been topped off by a massive, boulder belfry tower at the south end housing the minister's study on its upper floor. References * Storrer, William Allin.

Located in the District of Mission about 60 km east of Vancouver, Hayward Lake is formed by Ruskin Dam, which lies about 3 km upstream from the Stave River's confluence with the Fraser River at Ruskin, which sits astride the Mission-Maple Ridge boundary. The lake begins at the tailrace from the Stave Falls Dam and is about 7.5 km in length and an average of 0.5 km wide, with a maximum width of 1.5 km when lengths of small inlets are taken into account. History Though cleared of debris since, for many years Hayward Lake was a flooded forest full of dead trees, which had not been logged by the time of the inundation of the canyon of the Stave River, which lies today in the lake's depths behind Ruskin Dam. The original roadbed of the Stave Falls Branch of the British Columbia Electric Railway climbed the canyon walls, now underwater, but the line was rebuilt as part of the construction of Ruskin Dam and its track along the west side of the lake is now a hiking and biking trail. Trestles used by the railway are still present along this route, although their ends have been demolished to prevent access for safety reasons. The west side trail, and a hiking-only route on the east side of the lake, are part of a BC Hydro recreation division project; a park at the lake's upper end, where there had been a townsite during construction of the Stave project, now has a public beach and includes a bandstand built for the filming of We're No Angels above Stave Dam and moved to its present location afterwards. The lake is named for the first operations manager of the Stave Powerhouse. Recreation In addition to the public beach at the Stave Falls end of the lake, there are small beaches along the lakeside trail. Canoeing on the lake is now mostly safe though some \\"snags\\" remain; power boats are not permitted, and canoeing or swimming within 1 km of Ruskin Dam is prohibited due to the risk of being sucked into the Ruskin Powerhouse's intakes, with a log-boom drawn across from shore to shore as a reminder.

Writing in Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital, Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins report that while living in Washington, D.C., Smith reacted to the violence of the Mount Pleasant race riots in the Spring of 1991 by prophetically writing in a letter to Allison Wolfe, \\"this summer's going to be a girl riot.\\" Other reports say she wrote, \\"we need to start a girl riot.\\"Anderson, Mark, Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital, Akashic Books, 2003 That summer, Olympia, Washington, students Wolfe and Molly Neuman, editors of Girl Germs zine, to which Smith had contributed, moved to Washington, D.C. Having already formed their band Bratmobile, they asked Smith and Christina Billotte (of Autoclave and Slant 6) to join, and the band released one cassette tape, called Bratmobile DC, with this line-up. As written about in Bikini Kill zine by Kathleen Hanna, Jen proposed they all collaborate on a zine called Girl Riot, which would serve as a networking forum for young women. Molly Neuman began the zine, released under the title riot grrrl, with contributions from Smith, Wolfe, and the members of Bikini Kill. At the end of the summer Bratmobile returned to Olympia and Jen Smith stayed behind to edit a zine called Red Rover. A number of issues were released before, in 1993, she began a new zine, an offshoot of Red Rover, called Another Lo-Fi Xtravanganza. The zine also became a small record label, releasing cassettes by artists such as Wandering Lucy. At the same time, Smith began a band with Donna Dresch and Nikki Chapman called Rastro! The trio, with Smith on guitar and vocals, Chapman on bass, and Dresch on drums, released two songs on compilations by independent record labels such as Simple Machines. After this band broke up, Smith moved to Olympia, Washington where she recorded Boot Party with Dub Narcotic Sound System, and began the Cha Cha Cabaret, which she hosted under the persona of \\"Miss Lady Hand Grenade\\" in 1996 and 1997.

As early as 1877, Mermithidae was listed as one of nine subdivisions of the Nematoidea. Mermithidae are confused with the horsehair worms of the phylum Nematomorpha that have a similar life history and appearance. A mermithid questing for Dermaptera Mermithids are parasites, mainly of arthropods. Most are known from insects, but some are recorded from spiders, scorpions and crustaceans. A few are known to parasitize earthworms, leeches and molluscs, and a specimen is known from a spider preserved in Baltic amber. At least 25 species are known to parasitize mosquito larvae, making them of considerable interest in biological control. A species, probably Pheromermis vesparum, was recorded from the invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) in France. The parasite was considered to be a member of the local fauna which had adapted to a new host. However, the authors concluded that the mermithid could not hamper the hornet invasion nor be used in biological control programs against this invasive species. Life history Mermithids are wire-like and have a smooth cuticle with layers of spiral fibres. The digestive tract is similar to that of free-living nematodes only in the young larvae prior to their parasitic life; in the parasitic stages the oesophagus is disconnected from the mid-intestine, and females lack an anus. The female genital opening is at the midbody, while the male opening is at the tip and visible as one or two spicules. The eggs are laid either in water or on land, and the newly hatched larvae are free-living, as are the adults that emerge from the hosts to lay eggs.Rubzov, I. A. (1972). \\"Aquatic Mermithidae of the Fauna of the USSR\\", Vol. 1. (Zoological Institute, Academy of Science USSR). The taxonomy of the group has been confused due to poor specimen collection as well as very limited morphological characteristics, and most are discovered by entomologists rather than nematologists. Even the best-studied species, Romanomermis culicivorax, has an unclear taxonomic status.Petersen, J. J. (1985) \\"Nematodes as biological control agents: Part 1. Mermithidae\\", pp 307-344\\\\. In: Baker, J. R. & Muller, R. (eds). Advances in Parasitology. Academic Press, London. Host behavior alteration Mermithid nematodes induce water-seeking behavior in their hosts, by relying on altering the host's hemolymph osmolality (concentration of salt) to achieve the same effect.

The museum started in 1971 with the purchase of a former Erie Railroad Depot from the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. Since then the museum has grown to include a one-mile demonstration railroad, connecting it with the New York Museum of Transportation in Rush, making it one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum was formerly an operation of the Rochester Chapter National Railway Historical Society until 2011. The organization rosters more than 40 pieces of historic railroad equipment, including diesel and steam locomotives, electric trolley and multiple-unit cars, freight cars, cabooses, passenger cars, and work equipment. The museum campus includes a number of preserved railroad structures, including the 1909 Industry Depot built by the Erie Railroad, a waiting shelter from the Rochester, Lockport & Buffalo Railroad, and a crossing watchman's shanty from the New York Central. Train rides are operated and the museum is open to the public on select weekends from June through October, and is staffed entirely by volunteers.  History   Site history  The site of the RGVRRM has been home to railroading since 1851, the year when the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad was chartered. This depot served the nearby village of Scottsville, approximately three miles to the west, from 1853 to 1874. The depot provided the village with daily mail, express, and passenger service by means of an omnibus. In 1858 the Rochester and Genesee Valley Railroad was leased to the Buffalo, New York & Erie Railroad, which in turn was controlled by the Erie Railway. By 1874 the Rochester and State Line Railroad reached the village of Scottsville proper, and the Erie depot became less attractive to local citizens. The Rochester and State Line would eventually become part of the Baltimore & Ohio, and currently, as of 1986, operated as Rochester and Southern Railroad. In the early part of the 20th century, the Erie electrified the line from downtown Rochester to Mount Morris, NY. This was the only part of the Erie that was electrified. The 34-mile electric line was put into service on June 18, 1907. The route from Rochester to Mount Morris was covered in about an hour and ten minutes, and hourly service was provided from 6:00am to 11:30pm. The improvements never managed to pay for themselves, and electric service was discontinued in 1934.http://erielackhs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=5&Itemid;=16 Passenger service ended in September 1941, though many freight customers remained on the line. Industry depot was used as a freight agency until the mid-1950s when it was closed and the building was used for storage. In 1960 the Erie merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. As a result of general economic downturn and the devastation in the aftermath of 1972's Hurricane Agnes, Erie Lackawanna became a part of Conrail 1976. In 1996, the short line Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad acquired the route north of Avon and continues to operate the former Erie branch today. Throughout the railroads' presence, the depot has had several names. At first it was named Scottsville, for the nearby village. Once a railroad was built through Scottsville, the name of the depot was changed to Oatka, named for Oatka Creek, which flows into the nearby Genesee River. In 1902, the \\"State Agricultural & Industrial School,\\" a school for troubled boys, relocated to the Town of Rush.Unknown. \\"Industry School 160th Anniversary & Family Day\\", 2009, Accessed January 7, 2011 When the current depot was constructed in about 1909, the name was changed to Industry, to reflect the small community that the School had created.  Museum history  The Rochester Chapter was founded in 1937,\\"Rochester Chapter National Railway Historical Society\\" Accessed January 7, 2011. and by the late 1960s was ready to start a museum due to the ongoing acquisition of artifacts and rolling stock. After a survey of several locations around Rochester, New York, the former Erie Depot, located in Industry, was selected. The depot was built in 1909 as \\"Oatka,\\" later changed to \\"Industry\\" after the newly established state school for boys. The depot features two waiting rooms, separated by the agent's office. It was custom of the time to provide separate waiting areas for men and women. In later years, the separate waiting room was used to segregate inmates from the state school from the public. The last passenger train stopped at Industry on September 30, 1941, and the depot was closed in 1950. Over the years, the Erie survived a few name changes and bankruptcies and merged with its long-time competitor to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. The Rochester Chapter was seeking a home and possible museum site for its activities, and discovered Industry depot was available. The depot had been abandoned since 1957, and by December 1969, the Rochester Chapter had adopted it as their new home. The depot was purchased outright from EL in 1971 for the ceremonial sum of $1.00. After years of restoration by volunteers, the Depot has been restored to how it would have appeared in the 1930s. Since acquiring the depot, the museum has been growing both facilities and expanding track capacity. The site had no available sidings, even though the Erie Lackawanna track was still in use for freight service. By 1979 volunteers had constructed enough track to receive the first piece of equipment, a Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway caboose #280. In 1981, the RGVRRM got its first locomotive, EK 6, recently retired from Eastman Kodak. Volunteers started to acquire additional railroad and construction equipment. This led to the eventual completion of a demonstration railroad, completed in 1993. Track cars, or speeders, were first used to give visitors rides on the museum demonstration railroad. In addition to track cars, diesel-hauled trains are operated for special events. In 1998, the museum began their popular Diesel Days weekend celebration showcasing the collection of operating vintage diesels for the public. Regular operation of track cars ended in 2010, and all rides are now provided by diesel-hauled trains consisting of restored freight train cabooses. The museum continues to grow and expand, with additional storage space planned to house its unique collection of equipment. The museum is unique as it is one of the only operating railroad museums in New York State. The museum prides itself on maintaining most of its collection in operating condition, which further enhances the visitor experience. Collection The collection of the Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum is quite extensive. The RGVRRM rosters 10 locomotives, 13 freight cars, 15 pieces of passenger equipment and various other pieces of rail equipment. Of note, distinctive high-hood \\"Hammerhead\\" Lehigh Valley Railroad RS3m 211 is part of the operating collection. The museum is also home to the sole remaining trolley car (Car # 60) from the Rochester Subway fleet, returned to Rochester Chapter in 1998 after being on loan and later in storage for many years.Warner, Rand. \\"Car #60 Arrived at R&GV; RR Yard at 9:45 AM, Friday, June 5, 1998\\", \\"The Semaphore\\", June 1998, Accessed January 7, 2011 In 1998 a steel building was erected to assist in the preservation and restoration of equipment. 2007 saw the arrival of the seven Budd-built 1941-vintage Empire State Express coaches that are used for Fall Foliage trips, operated on the Ontario Midland Railroad between 1993-2004, and most recently on the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad. Because Rochester is known as the \\"World's Image Center\\" and is associated with photography and the home of Eastman Kodak, the museum boasts an extensive collection of photos. Of note is the collection of steam-era images from Robert Carper, a Rochester native who authored \\"American Railroads in Transition.\\" Many of the photos from that book are now in the museum's collection, and on display for visitors to enjoy. Other artifacts include an extensive collection of signaling equipment. Rochester was home to General Railway Signal, and as such the installation and operation of signals on the railroad is a long-term goal. Items include an operating semaphore, searchlights, an under restoration Saxby and Farmer armstrong machine and a Union Switch and Signal CTC Machine.

Over the years, these cars were used for scenic excursions. As of 2008, they are being refurbished with new window glazing and improved heating systems. Another noteworthy car is the \\"Pine Falls,\\" a 1939 Pullman built sleeper-lounge for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The museum also has in its collection the last car from the last train of ex-Lackawanna DC-electric MU's to depart from Hoboken Terminal in 1984. Two baggage cars are also part of the collection. An ex-Baltimore & Ohio baggage car serves as a tool car and workshop, while an ex-Lackawanna baggage car has been refurbished to house displays. An ex-Pennsylvania Railroad class B60 Railway Post Office is currently being refurbished to house additional displays.  Freight equipment  There are a total of 13 pieces of freight equipment in the collection. Most often used are two cabooses. Erie C254 was restored in the mid-1990s and sees regular service. It was constructed by the Erie Railroad at their Dunmore, PA, Shops in 1946. Penn Central 18562 was built in East Rochester, New York, in 1969 at the Despatch Shops. It was donated in 1996 by Conrail to the museum where it was restored to its original Penn Central appearance. MDT 14053 is an ice-cooled refrigerated boxcar built by Pacific Car and Foundry, and houses displays related to the Despatch Shops in East Rochester, where thousands of cars like it were built until 1970. Former Lehigh Valley Railroad \\"Northeastern\\" style caboose 95100 was acquired in 2011 from a local scrap yard to be restored to operating condition. In 2014, a former U.S. Army 40-foot flatcar was acquired from the Lowville and Beaver River Railroad, to be converted into an open-air rider flat. The conversion was completed and the car entered service in August 2017.
