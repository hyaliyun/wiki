Strabo reports that it belonged to the Eteocretes, and contained the temple of the Dictaean Zeus, for Mount Dicte was in the territory of Praesus. Strabo reports that Praesus was located between as lying between the promontories Samonium and Chersonesus, at the distance of 60 stadia from the sea, and close to Mount Dicte. However, Strabo confuses Praesus with Priansus, when he says it bordered upon the territory of Leben, and was distant 70 stadia from the sea, and 180 from Gortyn. The site was populated in Neolithic times, and remnants of Minoan and Mycenaean settlements have also been found. The inhabitants of Praesus believed that the Kouretes were children of Athena and Helios. The city was razed by the inhabitants of Hierapytna in 140 BCE, in a war that pitted Gortyn and Hierapytna against Cnossus and its allies. Praesus was mentioned by Theophrastus in On Love: Leucocomas, the beloved of Euxinthetus, gives his lover the task of bringing his dog back from Praesus to Gortyn. The territory of Praesus extended across the island to either sea.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 18, Huds.

It was formed in 1990 and disbanded in 1998. ==History== The school was established at RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra in January 1990. While it formed part of the Australian Army's Training Command, more than half of the members of the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 5 Squadron (which was previously responsible for helicopter pilot training) were transferred to the school when the squadron was disbanded in December 1989. As of April 1990, the ADFHS was equipped with Eurocopter AS350 Écureuils which were used to train Australian military pilots as well as Bell UH-1 Iroquois which were used to train members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and other militaries as part of Australia's Defence Cooperation Program. Trainee Australian pilots were posted to the school after completing basic flight training at No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF. The ADFHS then provided these pilots with initial helicopter training. After gaining their wings at the ADFHS, Army pilots completed their training at the School of Army Aviation in Oakey, Queensland. In May 1991 it was announced that the ADFHS was to be relocated to Oakey. This transfer did not occur, however. In 1998 a review of the ADF's helicopter training arrangements recommended that the ADFHS be disbanded. The Australian Government accepted this recommendation. That year, the Army elements of the unit became the Army Helicopter School and the Royal Australian Navy elements were relocated to HMAS Albatross near Nowra, New South Wales. The Army Helicopter School was transferred to Oakey in 2001. Initial helicopter training for ADF members was re-centralised in January 2018, when the Joint Helicopter Aircrew Training School opened at HMAS Albatross. This unit is responsible for training pilots for both the Army and Navy. ==References== ;Citations ;Works consulted * * Category:Aviation units and formations of the Australian Army Category:1990 establishments in Australia Category:1998 disestablishments in Australia Category:Military units and formations established in 1990 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1998 ","title":"Australian Defence Force Helicopter School"},{"id":"56553787","text":"The Grand Collar of the State Of Palestine is the highest civilian order of the State of Palestine.

Born in Hale, England, Cohn's conversion to art came at the age of 14, at an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso at the Manchester Art Gallery. Cohn became a precocious collector, looking for finds in junk shops. In his later teens Cohn moved to London, where he met painter Michael Ayrton, from whom he bought his first art work. Cohn met his life partner Bill Vernon in 1968. Six years later they moved to New Zealand, where Cohn worked as an industrial journalist and began buying New Zealand art, beginning with a work on paper by Colin McCahon. According to art critic Hamish Keith, Cohn \\"had a fine eye for art, but also a keen appreciation for a bargain. He saw New Zealand art as undervalued at a time when Auckland had a mere handful of struggling galleries mainly dealing in established names\\". This observation led Cohn to open his eponymous gallery. Despite its relatively short period of operation (1978-1986), Cohn and his gallery were known for showing leading artists and supporting the careers of younger and newer artists, including Malcolm Harrison, Christine Hellyar, Tony Fomison, Philip Clairmont and Allen Maddox. He also sought out a younger market of collectors, who had not yet began buying established artists' works. After the gallery closed in 1986 Cohn continued to deal art from his home, and worked with partner Bill Vernon on museum and gallery software, which became Vernon Systems.

Bush (October 17, 1881 – August 4, 1955) was the third mayor of Anchorage, Alaska. ==Biography== Charles William Bush was born in Germany and immigrated with his family to the United States while he was still an infant. He came of age in Portland, Oregon where he worked as a clothing salesman. In 1905, he moved to Valdez, Alaska, where he operated a tobacco store with his sister, Emma. In 1915, he moved to the not-yet-incorporated city of Anchorage. It was about this time that a boy, Edward, was born to Charles and his wife, Dora. While in Anchorage, Bush worked for many years as a manager of the Brown & Hawkins general mercantile store, and in 1923, he was elected to the Anchorage City Council. After Anchorage mayor M. Joseph Conroy resigned on October 2, 1924, Bush was appointed by the City Council to complete Conroy's term. He was re-elected as mayor in 1925, but resigned from the office of mayor on December 16, 1925. Meanwhile, Brown & Hawkins decided to close its Anchorage store, and Bush return to Portland. Bush moved to San Diego, California sometime between 1926 and 1930, where he worked as a salesman for the Marston Company, a local department store.

Born in Liverpool, Maddox migrated to New Zealand in 1963 with his family. He studied painting briefly at the School of Fine Arts at Canterbury University before dropping out to pursue an advertising career. Maddox had his first solo dealer show at the Elva Bett Gallery in Wellington in 1973. Maddox was often paired with fellow artists and good friends Philip Clairmont and Tony Fomison, a grouping known as the 'Militant Artists Union'. All three were known for their bohemian lifestyles, expressionist painting style and heavy use of alcohol and drugs. A certain amount of mythology built up around the artists' friendships and lives. As Richard McWhannell wrote in his obituary of Maddox, > The name Allen Maddox is associated with much myth and speculation. Most is > hearsay and by nature erroneous. It's fair to say he was no regular chap. He > suffered from a psychological illness described as schizophrenia and his > psychosis was mostly controlled by medication. However the drugs were very > strong and there were times when he wanted to be free of their debilitating > side effects. And so there were the occasional spectacular incidents when > the controls weren't there or weren't enough. Yes there were times when he > went 'off ' and in his words, did 'some terrible things'. Those regrettable > things were to seriously stigmatise him. Part cause, I believe, that he was > never given a solo public exhibition, nor has been properly represented by > certain public collections. Maddox was best known for his use of a cross/X motif in his work, said to have emerged when he emphatically crossed out a failed work in 1976. Art historian William McAloon described the motif as 'something of a self-portrait', referring to the regularity with which the artist returned to it. The motif has been interpreted in all manner of ways, including as \\"a symbol of anonymity, failure, Christianity, the unknown, the illiterate\\". Maddox died in Napier in 2000, aged 51. A memorial exhibition was organised by City Gallery Wellington. Curators Gregory O'Brien and Rebecca Wilson described his work as \\"probably the most thorough and impassioned instance of abstract expressionist art yet produced in this country.\\" Maddox's works are held in public collections across New Zealand, including the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Auckland Art Gallery, the Sarjeant Art Gallery and Christchurch Art Gallery. ==Further reading== * William McAloon, Wild Boys, review of Militant Artists Reunion, 15 January 2005 ==References== Category:Modern painters Category:New Zealand painters Category:1948 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Artists from Liverpool Category:People from Napier, New Zealand ","title":"Allen Maddox"},{"id":"56554310","text":"Monumento a la Mujer is a bronze statue commemorating the contributions of the Puerto Rican women to the Puerto Rican society.

The monument was the first and, at the time, the only one of its kind \\"in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.\\"Plaque at base of the monument. August 2010. ==Background== With the turn of the century, the role of women in Puerto Rican society had advanced dramatically. There were more women graduating from colleges and universities and more women than ever were entering the fields of politics, public health, management, finance, and even clergy work. At the time, the city of Ponce had just undergone significant improvements in its infrastructure thanks to the Plan Ponce en Marcha. The Ponce chapter of the Union of American Women commissioned a statue be built to commemorate the role of women in that advancement. The result was \\"Monumento a la Mujer.\\" ==Description== The statue is six feet high and was forged in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.Plaque at base of the monument. August 2010. It consists of a young woman with her right arm stretched up high and holding a small depiction of the globe of the Earth on her hand. The statue is supported by a 12-foot high pedestal in two levels. The top level, 10 feet high, is built in marble and is supported by a 4-feet high lower level built in concrete. There is a triangular obelisk that protrudes about 8 inches from the front of the pedestal that, when viewed from certain angles, gives the impression the statue rests on an obelisk. The monument has various plaques commemorating the history behind the monument. There is also a time capsule (5 August 1992 to 5 August 2092) that is buried at the back base of the monument. The dedicatory plaque on the monument has an inscription that reads (Note: English translation is not part of the inscription, and it is given here to the right): { border=0 -  valign=top  ::: A LA MUJER :Con este Monumento se honra :a la Mujer, que por su virtud, :esfuerzo y altas cualidades ha :contribuido brillantemente a :forjar la Historia y la Cultura, :logrando asi un sitial de :igualdad en el Mundo, siendo :siempre imagen de Belleza y :transmisora de la Vida. :::5 de agosto de 1992  valign=top  ::: TO THE WOMAN :This Monument honors :the Woman, who for her virtue, :effort and high qualities has :contributed brilliantly to :forge History and Culture, :thus achieving a place of :equality in the World, being :always an image of Beauty and :the transmitter of Life. :::5 August 1992'' } The statue is the work of Puerto Rican sculptor María Elena Perales Guzmán,NotiSur.

The attack has been described as one of the worst since the 2016 Uri attack. The man described by the Indian Army as the mastermind of the attack, Mufti Waqas, a commander in Jaish-e-Mohammed, was killed in an army operation on 5 March 2018 in south Kashmir's Awantipur. == Attack == In the early hours of Saturday 10 February 2018, at around 4:10 am IST, three heavily armed militants attacked a camp of 36th Brigade which housed army personnel as well as their families. The attackers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades. They entered the residential quarters and opened fire, killing four soldiers and injuring at least nine others including women and children. The militants were cornered in a residential complex and special forces were deployed in a battle that lasted over 24 hours, at the end of which all the militants were killed. The army camp consisting of 150 buildings was cleared out. Subsequently, flushing operations were carried out to neutralise the remaining attackers. Five soldiers, all serving in the 1st battalion, Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, were killed in the attack: Sub. Madan Lal Choudhary, Sub. Mohammad Ashraf Mir, Hav. Habibullah Qurashi, Nk. Manzoor Ahmed and L/Nk. Mohammad Iqbal. L/Nk. Mohammad Iqbal's father, a civilian, was also killed. Four of them were Kashmiri Muslims. Attackers were identified as Kari Mushtaq, Mohammad Khalid Khan and Mohammad Adil, all of whom were Pakistani nationals. There were also reports that some of the Illegal Rohingyas living in jammu, might have provided logistical assistance to these terrorists. == Aftermath == The attack happened at a distance of six kilometers from the University of Jammu. Schools in the region were shut and a high alert was sounded in the entire region following the attack. Anti- Pakistan slogans were raised in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly following the attack. Local residents of Jammu chanted anti-Pakistan slogans. The pregnant wife of a soldier, Rfn. Nazir Ahmed, was shot in the back during the attack. She was immediately taken to a military hospital and soon afterwards delivered her baby successfully. India's defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman visited the injured victims. She blamed Pakistan for the attack and said \\"Pakistan will pay\\" for the \\"misadventure\\". Pakistan responded the next day rejecting the allegations and accusing India of generating \\"war hysteria\\". The US Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, said in his testimony to the Senate Select Committee, that Pakistan-supported terrorist groups would continue to carry out attacks in India. He added that Pakistan's perception of its \\"eroding position\\" relative to India in economic and domestic security spheres drove it towards goals counter to those of the United States. Controversial Indian parliamentarian Asaduddin Owaisi highlighted the fact that five out of the seven killed in the attack were Kashmiri Muslims. The BJP replied to his statement as giving a \\"communal angle\\" to the sacrifices made by the Army. The Indian Army said that it was above religion and would not \\"communalise [the] martyrs\\". Thousands of local residents gathered to mourn the deaths of the slain soldiers in their home towns of Kupwara, Reshipora in Tral, Kewa village in Anantnag. Army soldiers were also present to give a guard of honour. == See also == * Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir * Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism == References == Category:Kashmir conflict Category:Terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2018 Category:Terrorist incidents in India in 2018 Category:Mass murder in 2018 Category:2010s in Jammu and Kashmir ","title":"2018 Sunjuwan attack"},{"id":"56554321","text":"Candide Pralong (born 24 September 1990) is a Swiss cross-country skier who competes internationally.FIS profile He represented Switzerland at the 2018 Winter Olympics. ==Olympic results== {  style=\\"font- size:95%; text-align:center; border:grey solid 1px; border-collapse:collapse; background:#ffffff;\\" ! 369; color:white; width:60px;\\" Year ! 369; color:white; width:40px;\\" Age ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" 15 km individual ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" 30 km skiathlon ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" 50 km mass start ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" Sprint ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" 4 × 10 km relay ! 4180be; color:white; width:75px;\\" Team sprint -  2018  31  50 31  31  —  —  — } ==World Cup results== All results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).

The route starts at the Mississippi–Louisiana state line, and it travels northeastward from that point. It intersects MS 48 southwest of Liberty, and MS 569 becomes concurrent with it. Inside Liberty, MS 569 is also concurrent with MS 24 briefly before travelling northeastward out of the city. It continues through Amite County and it ends at U.S. Route 98 (US 98) in extreme southwestern Lincoln County. The road was designated in 1955, as part of projects initiated by the Mississippi State Highway Department (MSHD). The route was finished by 1956, and the majority of it was paved by 1958. MS 569 was officially opened in a ceremony in Liberty on October 17, 1958. The road was completely paved by 1960. ==Route description== The route is located in Amite and Lincoln counties. MS 569 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3, and is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) as part of the state highway system. MS 569 starts at the Mississippi–Louisiana state line, where it meets the northern terminus of Louisiana Highway 67 (LA 67). The road travels northeastward, intersecting Homer Road and crossing over Beaver Creek. It then intersects Lower Centreville Road, which leads to the unincorporated area of Olio. MS 569 and Lower Centreville Road are briefly concurrent to cross the Mart Branch, and the latter continues eastward. MS 569 then crosses Mill Creek past Banks Road. Travelling through the forest and small tracts of farmland, the road turns north at Street Road. It continues over Shaw and Causey Creeks before meeting MS 48 at a three-way junction at Beechwood. The route becomes concurrent with MS 48 and both routes travel northeastward towards Liberty. Between the routes' intersection with Enterprise Road, it crosses over Wagoner Creek and West Fork of the Amite River. The road enters Liberty past County Farm Road. MS 48 and 569 bends northward near the center of the town. Known as South Broad Street, the routes intersect West Borden Avenue and Washington Street before meeting MS 24 at a signalized intersection. The Amite County Courthouse is located to the southeast of the intersection. MS 48 and 569 become concurrent with MS 24 and travel eastward. The three routes travel along East Main Street, intersecting some city streets and the northern terminus of MS 584 at Gillsburg Road. Several yards later, MS 569 turns north, ending concurrencies with MS 24 and 48. The road then turns northeastward at Broken Street, and it leaves the city at Tower Hill Road. The road travels northeastward across multiple creeks and meeting multiple gravel roads through the forest. An incorporated area, Hustler, is located off Rollison Road, which meets MS 569 and Thompson Road. After crossing a branch of East Fork of the Amite River, the route intersects MS 570. MS 569 enters Lincoln County past Branch Road. After crossing the county line, the route ends at US 98. The road continues as Frances Trail Southwest north of US 98. ==History== The route was designated in January 1955, as part of new projects announced by MSHD. The project, known as Federal Aid Secondary Project S-0242, included excavation, grading of the road from the Louisiana–Mississippi state line to the community of Beechwood, and building multiple culverts and one bridge. The contract was awarded to W.L. Wells for $314,214 () later that month. By 1956, the road appeared on the state map, extending from the state line to Auburn, with a small section near Liberty already paved. MS 569 was extended northward along a paved road to Lucien in Franklin County by 1957. The section from the state line to Beechwood was paved by 1958, with a cost of $69,978.98 (). The road from Liberty to Smithdale was paved during 1958 by the Road Builders Construction Company, with a contract worth $72,432. MS 569 was officially opened on October 17, 1958, with a ribbon ceremony in Liberty. By 1960, the state map showed all of the route already paved. The section in Franklin County was removed from the state highway system by 1967. ==Major intersections== Amite County Courthouse, located at the intersection of MS 24 and MS 48/569. ==See also== *Mississippi Highway 572 – Now known as Lower Centreville Road ==References 569 569 Category:Transportation in Lincoln County, Mississippi ","title":"Mississippi Highway 569"},{"id":"56554395","text":"The Coquille River is a tributary of Nicabau Lake, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, into the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada. This river crosses successively the cantons of Charron and Ducharme. This river is part of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second. A secondary forest road (heading north-east) that connects to route 167 serves the upper part of the \\"Coquille River\\" valley passing north of Lake Liasse and South of \\"Coquille Lake\\". Route 167 between Chibougamau and Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the west side of the lower part of the river. The surface of the Coquille River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography == The hydrographic slopes near the Coquille River are: * north side: Lac de la Coquille, Charron Lake (Normandin River), Boisvert River (Normandin River), Boisvert Lake; * east side: Chaudière River (Normandin River), Tonnerre River (Normandin River); * south side: Nicabau Lake, Tonnerre River (Normandin River), Normandin River, Bouteroue Creek; * west side: Charron Lake (Normandin River), Malo Lake, Obatogamau Lakes, La Dauversière Lake.

The mouth of this head lake is located at: * east of Charron Lake (Normandin River); * north of the mouth of the \\"Coquille River\\" (confluence with the Nicabau Lake); * north of the mouth of the Nicabau Lake whose southern portion is crossed by the Normandin River; * northwest of the mouth of the Normandin River (confluence with Ashuapmushuan Lake. From the mouth of \\"Coquille Lake\\", the \\"Coquille River\\" flows over according to the following segments: * southwesterly in Charron Township forming a southeasterly curve in marsh areas to the northern limit of Ducharme Township, corresponding to the dump (coming from the South-East) of \\"Lac des Charagnes\\"; * westward in Charron township, including crossing Pommelé Lake (length: ; altitude: ) to the northern limit of the township of Ducharme; * southwesterly in Ducharme Township to the north shore of Liasse Lake; * southerly crossing Liasse Lake (elevation: ) consisting of a widening of the river to its mouth; * to the south, in particular crossing Troilet lake (length: ; altitude: ), up to mouth of the river.River segments measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The \\"Coquille River\\" flows into a bay on the northeast shore of Nicabau Lake (length: altitude: ) which is crossed on towards the South, then towards the East, by the current of the Coquille River. From there, the current flows south-east along the Normandin River on to the northwestern shore of Ashuapmushuan Lake. Then, the current flows through the Ashuapmushuan River which flows to Saint-Félicien, Quebec on the west shore of Lac Saint-Jean. The confluence of the Coquille River with the Nicabau Lake is located at: * north- east of the mouth of Rohault Lake; * north of the mouth of Nicabau Lake whose southern part is crossed by the Normandin River; * northwest of the mouth of the Normandin River (confluence with Ashuapmushuan Lake; * northwest of the mouth of the Ashuapmushuan River (confluence with lac Saint-Jean). == Toponymy == The toponym \\"rivière de la Coquille\\" was formalized on June 18, 1971, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.Commission de toponymie du Quebec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \\"De la Coquille River\\" == Notes and references  See also == *Estuary of Saint Lawrence *List of rivers of Quebec Category:Rivers of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean Shell River Category:Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality ","title":"Coquille River (Normandin River tributary)"},{"id":"56554399","text":"Salimicrobium halophilum is a moderately halophilic bacterium from the genus of Salimicrobium which has been isolated from rotted wood in Japan. ==References== Category:Bacillaceae Category:Bacteria described in 1990 ","title":"Salimicrobium halophilum"},{"id":"56554415","text":"Giandomenico Salvadori (born 8 October 1992) is an Italian cross country skier who competes internationally.FIS profile He represented Italy at the 2018 Winter Olympics. ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Italian male cross-country skiers Category:Olympic cross-country skiers of Italy Category:Cross-country skiers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Tour de Ski skiers Category:People from the Province of Belluno ","title":"Giandomenico Salvadori"},{"id":"56554427","text":"Coquille River may refer to: * Coquille River (Oregon) * Coquille River (Normandin River), in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada ==See also== * Coquille River Falls, a two-tier waterfall located in the far north tip of the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest, just east of Port Orford, on the Oregon coast in Coos County, Oregon ","title":"Coquille River"},{"id":"56554431","text":"The Renkyō Line (連京線; in Chinese Lianjing Line, Liánjīng Xiàn) was the primary trunk line of the South Manchuria Railway from 1907 to 1945. The line ran between Dalian (Dairen) and Changchun (Xinjing). The rights to manage this railway line was one of the main concessions that Japan acquired from Russia after the Russo-Japanese War. It played an important role in Japan's control of Manchuria, as a key connection in traffic between east Asia and Europe and as a means of conveying resources mined inland to the coast. The line's importance to freight traffic decreased somewhat after the opening of the shorter North Chosen Line via the Korean port of Rajin. It remained important to passenger traffic, however, as the \\"Asia Express\\" Dalian–Harbin limited express train, inaugurated in 1943, operated on this line between Dalian and Xinjing.Ichihara, Yoshizumi, 写真集南満洲鉄道 (South Manchuria Railway Photo Collection) pp. 119-120, 135, 1998 Seibundo Shinkosha Publishing Co. Ltd. (in Japanese) In August 1945, after Japan's defeat in the Pacific War, control of this and all other Mantetsu lines was passed to the Sino-Soviet China Changchun Railway. ==History== The Renkyō Line began as the \\"South Manchuria Line\\" of the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway running from Harbin to Port Arthur. Russia obtained the rights to build this line from Qing China; work began on 27 March 1898, and the broad gauge line was opened to traffic in July 1903. Following Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan gained the rights to operate the Harbin–Lüshun (Ryojun) section of the CER; the line was then converted from Russian broad gauge to the Cape gauge used in Japan, to allow the use of rolling stock from Japan. The line was operated by the Imperial Japanese Army until it was taken over by the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu), established on 26 November 1906.Young, Japan's Total Empire, pp 25 Mantetsu immediately set to regauging the line again, this time from Cape gauge to standard gauge.Luis Jackson, Industrial Commissioner of the Erie Railroad. \\"Rambles in Japan and China\\". In Railway and Locomotive Engineering, vol. 26 (March 1913), pp. 91-92 Mantetsu created the Renkyō Line - then called the Manchu Main Line (満洲本線, Manshū Honsen, Mǎnzhōu Běnxiàn) - between Dairen and Mengjiatun (Mōkaton) on 1 April 1907, and extending it to Changchun (Chōshun) on 1 September 1907. Regauging of the entire line was completed in 1908, and on 27 May of that year through service between Dairen and Chōshun began on the all-standard gauge line. The Anpō Line, which connected to the Renkyō Line at Fengtian (Hōten) and was initially built as a narrow-gauge line, was converted to standard gauge in November 1911, and from 15 June 1912 direct operation between Busan and Changchun began, via the Chosen Government Railway's Gyeongbu and Gyeongui Lines, the Anpō Line, and the Renkyō Line from Fengtian to Changchun. Double-tracking of the line from Sujiatun (Sokaton) to Dairen was completed on 27 October 1908, but it wasn't until 30 November 1918 that the section from Sujiatun to Fengtian was doubled. Between 1919 and 1926 the entire line was relaid with 100-lb/yd (50 kg/m) rail. The first colour light signals for automatic block signalling were installed on the Dalian–Jinzhou (Kinshū) and Fengtian–Sujiatun sections on 12 February 1924, and the entire section from Dalian to Fengtian received automatic blocking by 5 November 1933. On 15 July 1927, the line's name was changed from Manchu Main Line to Renchō Line (連長線; \\"Lianchang Line\\", Liáncháng Xiàn, in Chinese). Using the Mukden Incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria, Japan created the puppet state of Manchukuo in March 1932;Encyclopædia Britannica article on Manchukuo Changchun was designated the capital city, and was renamed Xinjing (Shinkyō), and the line was renamed once again, becoming the Renkyō Line at that time. The \\"Asia Express\\", a world-class limited express train, was introduced on 26 September 1934 between Dalian and Xinjing. The Manchukuo National Railway, which had taken over the remainder of the Chinese Eastern Railway, finished the conversion of the Jingbin Line from Xinjing to Harbin from broad gauge to standard gauge on 31 August 1935, and from 1 September the Asia Express service was extended to Harbin. Japan's deteriorating situation in the Pacific War affected the line significantly. The Asia Express was suspended at the end of February 1943. The loss of air and sea superiority led to a drastic reduction in freight traffic to the port at Dalian, being instead redirected to Korean ports, via the North Chosen Line to the ports of Rajin and Unggi, and via the Anpō Line and the Chosen Government Railway to Busan. Between 1 August and 3 November 1944, the second track of the section between Sanshilibao (Sanjūrihō) and Dashiqiao (Daisekikyō) was removed, with the railways being used to upgrade Mantetsu's Anpō Line and the Manchukuo National Railway's Fengshan Line from Fengtian to Shanhaiguan.『満鉄四十年史』 \\"40 Years of Mantetsu\\", pp. 199–202\\" On 9 August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo, and on the 14th, the USSR and the Republic of China signed a treaty of friendship; the signing of the treaty was announced on the 27th. Under the terms of this treaty, a Sino-Soviet joint enterprise was formed, called the China Changchun Railway, to operate the Renkyō Line (known as the Changda Line after Xinjing reverted to its original name, Changchun) and a number of lines formerly owned by the Manchukuo National Railway, including the Xinjing–Harbin Jingbin Line and the Harbin–Manzhouli Binzhou Line. Mantetsu was formally dissolved on 30 September 1945.『満鉄四十年史』 \\"40 Years of Mantetsu\\", pp. 215–220\\" The China Changchun Railway was transferred to China Railway in 1955, after which the Changda Line was split up, with the Dalian–Shenyang section becoming the Shenda Railway, and the Shenyang–Changchun section becoming part of the Beijing–Harbin Jingha Railway. ==Services== In addition to many freight trains and local passenger trains, a number of domestic and international express and limited express trains operated on this line. Most important of these was the flagship \\"Asia Express\\", running between Dalian and Harbin from 1934 to 1943, which was comparable to the most prestigious European and American express trains of the day, which featured several world firsts, such as fully enclosed, air- conditioned carriages. The \\"Hato\\" express operated from 1932 to 1945, running between Dalian and Xinjing. There were two international express services serving Korea and Manchukuo: the \\"Hikari\\" between Busan and Harbin, which operated from 1934 to 1945, and the \\"Nozomi\\", which ran between Busan and Xinjing. ==Route== In the \\"Stops\\" columns, ● indicates a stop made by all trains of that category, ▲ indicates a stop made only by some trains of that category, ○ indicates a stop made by all trains of that category after October 1939, and  indicates that trains of that category did not stop at that station.

But under the Trump Administration, one week after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in, Sessions personally approved a subpoena for Sepulvado, who subsequently filed a motion to fight the order in federal court. Sepulvado argued that complying with the court order would “chill future sources, even nonconfidential ones” for himself and other Oregon Public Broadcasting reporters. On February 24, 2017, a federal judge ruled in Sepulvado's favor against the Justice Department and quashed the subpoena. Sepulvado broke stories on multiple key details on the rallies organized by alt-right and white nationalist groups throughout the Bay Area in 2017, including in-depth coverage of Identity Evropa founder Nathan Damigo, who was a co-organizer of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017.

During World War I, he worked for the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers and was sent to Stockholm to organize contacts with German-occupied Lithuania. He was the Lithuanian representative in Sweden and Norway (1919–1922), Netherlands (1921–1922), Latvia (1923–1927), Estonia (1923–1930), Finland (1929–1934), Czechoslovakia (1932–1934), Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil (1934–1939). In 1939, he was recalled to Kaunas and was deported by the Soviets to a Gulag camp in June 1941. He died in one of the camps in Mordovia. ==Early life and education== Aukštuolis was born in village near Alizava, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of well-off farmers that belonged to the Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church. He only had one sister and as the only son was set to inherit the farm, but his parents sent him to get education. After completing primary schools in Virbališkiai and Kupiškis, he enrolled into the Mitau Gymnasium in 1899. After the graduation in 1907, he continued his studies at the law Faculty of the Saint Petersburg University. After three years, he was expelled for participation in a student strike and other Menshevik activities. Invited by his cousin Martynas Yčas, Aukštuolis finished his studies at the Tomsk University. ==Career== Aukštuolis (standing third from left) at the Stockholm conference in 1917 In spring 1912, Aukštuolis returned to Lithuania and settled in Kaunas and got a job with the Kaunas District Court. He also helped Yčas with his election campaign to the Russian State Duma. In 1915, during World War I, Aukštuolis together with other court officials was evacuated to Moscow. There he joined the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers and visited various Russian cities, particularly Penza, Voronezh, Samara, organizing the relief to Lithuanian war refugees. However, contact with Lithuania was lost since it was occupied by German forces. It was possible to reestablish the contact via neutral Sweden and Aukštuolis was sent to the first Lithuanian conference in Stockholm and appointed manager of the Swedish–Lithuanian Aid Committee, chaired by Carl Lindhagen, mayor of Stockholm. Neutral Scandinavian countries became a bridge that allowed communication, including sending letters and parcels, and financial support to the occupied Lithuania. Lithuanians published articles in Scandinavian press explaining and promoting the Lithuanian goals of independence. Lithuania declared independence in February 1918 and Sweden recognized Lithuania de facto on 12 January 1919. On the same day, Aukštuolis was appointed as the first Lithuanian representative to Sweden. In July 1919, he was also appointed as the representative to Norway. At the time, the primary task of Lithuanian diplomats was to obtain de jure recognition of Lithuania's independence and support for Lithuania's membership in the League of Nations. In February 1922, due to financial difficulties, the legation in Sweden was closed and Aukštuolis was recalled to Kaunas where we worked as the director of the Law and Administration Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After a year, in February 1923, he was sent to Riga as the Lithuanian representative to Latvia and Estonia. There he met and married a daughter of a wealthy Latvian factory owner; they had no children. He was appointed as the envoy to Finland in March 1929 but was recalled to Kaunas in February 1930 and appointed as acting director of the Law and Administration Department (officially, he continued to represent Lithuania in Finland). Due to vacancies, it was the second position under minister Dovas Zaunius but Aukštuolis was not well regarded and did not leave a more prominent impact before his appointment to Czechoslovakia in October 1931. In Prague, Aukšuolis negotiated annual agreements for the export of Lithuanian butter, bacon, and eggs. In September 1934, Minister Stasys Lozoraitis appointed him to Argentina and Aukštuolis lived for five years in Buenos Aires. He also covered Brazil and Uruguay. In 1939, he was recalled to Kaunas and appointed as chief of diplomatic protocol. ==Gulag prisoner== When Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940, Aukštuolis along other dignitaries greeted Vladimir Dekanozov, deputy of Vyacheslav Molotov, at the Kaunas Airport. He remained in Lithuania though his wife fled to Argentina and he used his diplomatic contacts to help Martynas Yčas escape to Berlin. After the Soviet takeover, Aukštuolis lost his job at the ministry but with a recommendation from Justas Paleckis (they worked together at the Lithuanian legation in Riga) obtained a job teaching Russian language at the Secondary School No. 1 in Panevėžys. He was one of the 17,500 Lithuanians deported to Siberia during the June deportation in 1941. Together with several other prominent Lithuanians, including former president Aleksandras Stulginskis and minister Stasys Šilingas, Aukštuolis ended up in Kraslag in the Krasnoyarsk Krai. In 1942, he and 16 other Lithuanians were once again arrested and accused of anti-Soviet activities.

The film was originally titled as Hey Ram Humne Gandhi Ko Maar Diya, but the name was snipped by the Central Board of Film Certification. == Plot== This is a story is of two completely opposite ideologies, about two strangers who met in a train journey in the panorama of 28 January 1948. Amidst the environment of terror, communal riots and fear, on one side there is Kailash (Jatin Goswami), who is going to meet his mother, Savitri (Pratima Kazmi) from Calcutta to Sasaram, along with his wife, Sudha (Sameeksha Bhatnager) and a daughter. On the other side, Divakar (Subrat Dutta) is going to his village to take the responsibility as a teacher. Kailash had lost his everything in the \\"Action-day\\" in Calcutta and has a strong belief that Gandhi ji was responsible for the partition of our country. On the other side, Divakar has his own arguments and believes in Gandhi ji's philosophy of non-violence, tolerance, and embracing all the religions. Events happened during the two days journey, had different impacts on these two individuals and reactions to the events by both Kailash and Divakar, forces to think who is right and who is wrong. When they reaches their destination and ends the journey, they got to know that Gandhi ji was assassinated.

Brown and Peter Tomory, and championed abstract artists, especially Gordon Walters and Richard Killeen.\\" Pound completed his doctorate on the work of Richard Killeen and lectured in art history at the University of Auckland. Pound's particular concern was nationalism and New Zealand art. His 1983 book Frames on the land refuted earlier art historical arguments for a particular quality to New Zealand's light, which resulted in a bold, hard-eged approach to landscape painting in that country. Instead, he argued that visiting and immigrant artists in the 19th century brought established 'frames' with them (such as a sense of the land and a sublime and awesome force' through which they interpreted the New Zealand landscape. His 1994 book The Space Between: Pakeha Use of Maori Motifs in Modernist New Zealand Art came in the wake of the 1992 exhibition Headlands: Thinking Through New Zealand Art, and discusses the cultural appropriation of Māori art and culture by modern Pākehā New Zealand artists, including Gordon Walters, Colin McCahon and Richard Killeen. Pound's final book summarises his thinking on 1930s artists, writers and thinkers who used art, literature and theory to posit a new sense of New Zealand identity through high culture, and how from the 1970s this framework was dismantled.

The crash killed 19 people and injured 65. The incident was Hong Kong's second deadliest road traffic accident, behind a 2003 incident on Tuen Mun Road which killed 21. In July 2020, the bus captain was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years over the crash. In addition, he is no longer allowed to drive any vehicles. ==Incident== Crash The Volvo Super Olympian bus (Wright Explorer bodied, fleet number AVW78, registration number LX 9991) was running on route 872, a special route operated only on horse racing days. It was travelling from Sha Tin Racecourse, following a race day, to Tai Po Centre in Tai Po New Town. Before boarding the bus, the driver chatted with a bus fan for some time. It was reported that the bus departed the racecourse 10 minutes late, leading some passengers to scold and quarrel with the driver. Passengers said the driver then became frustrated, and \\"drove really fast as if he was throwing a tantrum\\". They said he drove \\"very, very fast\\" the whole time, without slowing for turns. As the bus was travelling on a downhill section of Tai Po Road, near Tai Po Mei village, it came to a bend where it flipped onto its left side, hitting a lamp post and destroying Tai Po Mei bus stop. Eighteen people were killed at the scene. Immediate aftermath Immediately after the crash, some passengers tried to physically attack the driver. Fire services officers had to cut into the bus to rescue those trapped inside, an operation that took about 85 minutes. A makeshift morgue was set up at the roadside. The death toll rose to 19 when a man died at 4:00 am the following morning at United Christian Hospital. Excluding this person, the accident left 65 people injured. The affected section of Tai Po Road was closed for 12 hours following the incident. Other bus routes normally plying the route were diverted to Tolo Highway. The road was partly closed again the following afternoon to accommodate a ceremony attended by about 200 mourners, government officials, and KMB management. ==Response== Kowloon Motor Bus The bus company posted on their Facebook page: \\"KMB expresses extreme regret and sadness at this accident, and deeply apologises.\\" The company said it would give HK$80,000 to every affected family, and would form a committee to investigate the accident. On 15 February 2018, in response to concerns raised by trade unions and the public (see below), KMB announced that it had ceasing giving shifts to part-time drivers who worked fewer than 18 hours per week. This comprises about 209 of around 360 part-time drivers. It also said it had suspended the hiring of new part-time drivers. On 18 February 2018, service on KMB Route 872 was resumed. To provide passengers peace of mind, the route was changed to only use single-decker buses. Also, a new express route 872X was started, which bypasses Tai Po Road (where the crash occurred) and uses Tolo Highway instead. According to The Independent Review Committee on Hong Kong’s Franchised Bus Service, formed after the accident, KMB was considering spending HK$200 million to install seatbelts on older KMB buses in Hong Kong to increase bus safety. They have also tested an anti- drowsiness device for drivers which will use facial recognition software to detect the driver's level of alertness. In addition, KMB announced that 160 buses equipped with electronic stability systems and speed-limiting devices were expected to arrive in Hong Kong by August 2018. KMB has also tried reducing the special shifts of drivers from 14 hours to 13. Hong Kong government On the night of the accident, chief executive Carrie Lam visited victims at the Prince of Wales Hospital and announced that a separate commission of inquiry, led by a judge, would be set up to investigate the safety of the public transport system, in particular, of the public buses. She also said that relatives of the dead would each receive $300,000, while the injured would receive between $150,000 and $250,000 each. These funds have been provided by various charitable organisations including the Jockey Club, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, Yan Chai Hospital, and Pok Oi Hospital. The government also announced that flags would be flown at half-mast, and the annual Lunar New Year fireworks over Victoria Harbour, scheduled for 17 February, would be cancelled in an expression of grief. On 13 March 2018, the Vice President of the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice Michael Lunn, was named as chairman of the three-member commission of inquiry. Unions The day after the crash, the Motor Transport Workers General Union (affiliated with the Federation of Trade Unions) held a press conference to criticise working conditions at KMB. They said that poor pay has led to a shortage of drivers, and alleged that drivers are not provided enough training nor permitted sufficient rest. Similarly, the Confederation of Trade Unions picketed the company's headquarters in protest of alleged low salaries. Kwok Wai-kwong, chairman of the KMB Staff Union, criticised the company's practice of hiring part-time drivers. He characterised them as amateurish, and said the company required they only train for two days (while full time drivers must complete 18 days of training). The driver of KMB Yip Wai Lam started an impromptu strike with several drivers at KMB on the following Sunday, which brought the bus company to the table for negotiation over working hours and conditions. Public The day following the crash, there were hours-long queues at Hong Kong Red Cross blood donation centres as thousands of Hongkongers sought to help those injured in the accident. The Causeway Bay Donor Centre extended its operating hours to accommodate the queue. The Red Cross announced that it would keep 12 blood donation centres open through the Lunar New Year holiday. ==Driver== A KMB manager stated that the 30-year-old bus driver, Chan Ho-ming, had been employed with the company since 2014. Media reported that he had worked part time since 2017 and was not assigned to a specific route, but ordinarily worked on Saturdays and Sundays driving special routes. He survived the accident and was arrested for dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. Chan appeared at the Fanling Magistrates' Court on 13 February 2018. He did not enter a plea, was denied bail, and was remanded in custody. In October his charges were upgraded to include multiple counts of manslaughter; a conviction would be punishable by life imprisonment. The company initially said Chan had a \\"good driving record\\", had driven the route before, and had received enough rest before his shift. Contradicting KMB's claim that he possessed a good safety record, media alleged that he had been at the helm of another KMB bus that crashed in Kwai Chung on 2 August 2014. While making a turn at speed, his Dennis Trident 3 double-decker was seriously damaged after it slammed into kerbside railings and a structural column in the bus terminus at Kwai Fong station. A passenger and a pedestrian were injured. KMB subsequently admitted that Chan had been involved in this accident. He was convicted of careless driving, had driving offence points deducted, and had been fined. The company afterward deemed him fit to continue working. Chan has been reported to be a bus fan active on online bus enthusiast communities. A friend stated that he possessed a \\"bad driving attitude\\". In 2020, the bus captain pleaded guilty to 19 counts of manslaughter and 19 counts of dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm to another person, totaling 38 charges. The magistrate accused the defendant of being selfish and ignoring the safety of passengers. On 7 July 2020, Chan was sentenced to 14 years in prison and had all his driving licences revoked for life. ==Investigation== A view of the downhill approach to the crash site Immediately following the crash, passengers told local media that the driver was exceeding the speed limit. The police said they also suspected that the bus was speeding. They said that alcohol was not a factor in the accident. A passenger on the bus stated that \\"he felt as if the bus was travelling at \\". Investigator Lo Kok-keung estimated the bus entered the bend at up to , and said a safe travelling speed for the turn would be . The wrecked bus was removed from the site on the morning of 11 February and was transported to Tai Lam Chung for examination. The police said that the investigation would cover the speed, the mechanical condition of the bus, and the psychological state of the driver. The crash was investigated by the Regional Crime Unit, New Territories North. ==See also== * Bus services in Hong Kong * Transport in Hong Kong ==References * Category:2018 disasters in China Hong Kong bus accident Category:Bus incidents in Hong Kong Category:February 2018 events in China Category:Kowloon Motor Bus Category:New Territories ","title":"2018 Hong Kong bus accident"},{"id":"56554858","text":"Jeffrey Stahmann is a prolific inventor with over 300 US issued patents.

Whitfield (Also known as Captain Whitfield) (November 11, 1804 – 14 February 1886) was an American sea captain and later a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Born in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, he is primarily remembered today for having rescued the 14-year-old Manjirō Nakahama from a shipwreck in 1841 and acting as his foster father until Manjirō could return to sea in 1847.s.n.

Millicent Library ==Life and career== Whitfield was born in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. His mother, Sybil Whitfield, was unmarried, and he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Parnel Whitfield. Like his uncle George (1789–1882), he became a whaling captain, starting his career in 1819 at the age of 15 when he signed on as a crewman on the Martha, a ship commanded by his uncle. He subsequently served as the boat steerer of the Pacific, second mate on the Missouri, and first officer of the William Thompson. In 1835 Whitfield married Ruth C. Irish of Fairhaven Connecticut. He then sailed for the Pacific as captain of the Newark. During that voyage he learned that Ruth had died in May 1837. Devastated by his wife's death, Whitfield went into a year of seclusion on his return to Fairhaven in 1838.Bernard, Donald R. (1992). The Life and Times of John Manjiro, pp. 1–2; 41; 50; 214. McGraw-Hill. Fairhaven Massachusetts Office of Tourism (2017). Fairhaven Visitors' Guide, pp. 12–13; 26. In 1839 Whitfield became engaged to Albertina Keith of Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter he set sail once again for the seas of Japan as the captain of the whaler John Howland. On June 27, 1841 the ship encountered five Japanese fishermen who had been cast away on the small uninhabited island of Tori- shima, one of whom was the 14-year-old Manjirō Nakahama. Whitfield took them aboard. Manjirō acted as his cabin boy and quickly began to learn basic English. When the whaling season ended, the John Howland sailed into Honolulu in October 1841. Manjirō's four friends found employment there, but he begged to remain with Whitfield and continue on the voyage back to Fairhaven. Whitfield had also grown attached to the boy and regarded him as a foster son. The John Howland arrived back in Fairhaven in May 1843. Manjiro spent his first night in America at the Whitfield family house on Cherry Street. Shortly thereafter Whitfield left for his uncle George's home in Scipio, New York where he and Albertina were married on May 31, 1843. In the interim he arranged for Manjirō to board with the family of his friend Eben Akin and asked Jane Allen, a local teacher, to tutor Manjiro in preparation for formal schooling in the autumn. After William and Albertina's marriage, Manjirō lived with them as a member of the family, first in their house on Cherry Street in Fairhaven and then at their farm at nearby Sconticut Neck. Whitfield set sail again in 1844 as captain of the William and Eliza. It was during this voyage that his two-year-old son William Henry died in 1846 at the Sconticut Neck farm. Whitfield and Albertina had three more children: Marcellus Post (1849–1926), Sibyl Martha (1851–1894) and Albertina Pratt (1853–1876). Whitfield made several more voyages captaining the Gladiator, the Hibernia, and his own brig before retiring from the sea. In his later years, he became active in local politics, serving as a selectman of Fairhaven from 1871 to 1873 and as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1872 to 1873. Whitfield died on February 14, 1886 at his house on 11 Cherry Street in Fairhaven at the age of 81. Albertina died four years later. They are buried in the town's Riverside Cemetery as are all four of their children and Whitfield's first wife Ruth. ==Legacy== Manjirō Nakahama in his later years Manjirō Nakahama left Fairhaven to return to Japan in 1847 but he never forgot the kindness of Whitfield and the people of Fairhaven. In Japan his English skills and the education he had received led to his appointment as a samurai in the service of the Tokugawa Shogunate. In 1860 he wrote a lengthy letter to Whitfield in English recounting his life after he left Fairhaven. It began: > My Honored friend—I am very happy to say that i had an opportunity to say to > you a few lines. I am still living and hope you were the same blessing. i > wish to meet you in this world once more. How happy we would be. Give my > best respect to Mrs. and Miss Amelia Whitfield, i long to see them. Capt. > you must not send your boys to the whaling business; you must send them to > Japan. I will take care of him or them if you will. Let me know before send > and I will make the arrangement for it. In 1870 Manjirō was a member of a Japanese government commission sent to Europe to study military science during the Franco-Prussian War. Afterwards he went to the United States, was formally received in Washington, and then made his way by train to Fairhaven where he spent the night with Whitfield and his family at their farm in Sconticut Neck.Kawada, Ikaku and Manjirō Nakahama (English translation and notes by Junya Nagakuni, Junji Kitadai, and Stuart M. Frank) (2003).

Spinner Publications. Twenty years after his death, Nakahama's eldest son gifted a 14th-century samurai sword to the people of Fairhaven in gratitude for his father's rescue and the education he had received in the town. After a wreath-laying on Whitfield's grave, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States presented the sword in a ceremony on July 4, 1918. Calvin Coolidge, at the time Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, gave the welcoming address, concluding with: > This sword was once the emblem of place and caste and arbitrary rank. It has > taken on a new significance because Captain Whitfield was true to the call > of humanity, because a Japanese boy was true to his call of duty. In 1987 Akihito, the future Emperor of Japan, visited Fairhaven and Whitfield's grave, and Japanese visitors to the town still stop by the grave to leave gifts in tribute to Whitfield.Weisberg, Tim (2010). Ghosts of the South Coast, pp. 35–36 (electronic edition). Arcadia Publishing. A delegation from Fairhaven journeyed to Tosashimizu, Manjirō's native city, in December 1987 and signed a Sister City agreement between the two towns which in turn led to the establishment of the Whitfield-Manjiro Friendship Society. By 2007 Whitfield's old house on Cherry Street was in ruins and up for sale. On hearing this, Japanese members of the society began raising funds to buy and renovate it as a gift to Fairhaven. The house, now a museum dedicated to Manjirō Nakahama and his life in Fairhaven, was officially opened on May 7, 2009 in a ceremony attended by 100 of the Japanese donors, the Japanese Consul Generals to New York and Boston, and members of the 5th and 6th generations of both the Whitfield and Nakahama families.Whitfield-Manjiro Friendship Society (2016).\\"The Manjiro Story\\".

It is the fifth animated project based on Go Nagai's Cutie Honey manga franchise, celebrating the author's 50th anniversary as a manga artist. The series began airing in Japan in April 2018 and is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks. ==Plot== Honey Kisaragi is an android fitted with the Airborne Element Fixing Device, which allows her to transform into the warrior of love, Cutie Honey, among other forms. When her father is killed by the evil Panther Claw organisation, Honey teams up with the PCIS (Panther Claw Criminal Investigative Services) to fight against them, unaware that its key investigator, Inspector Genet, is really Panther Claw's leader, Sister Jill. ==Characters== ; :https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-05-04/cutie-honey-universe- reveals-full-cast-list-for-5-honeys/.131176 :Like in the original manga, Honey is a superpowered android living as a young boarding school girl at Saint Chapel Academy. Her powers come from an Airborne Element Fixing Device invented by her father, and it is this invention along with her innocence and good heart that makes her Sister Jill's target. Next to her standard Cutie Honey incarnation, this version sports the following alter egos: the motor-racing Hurricane Honey, the fashion-oriented Fancy Honey, the tomboyish and camera-oriented Flash Honey, the music-oriented Misty Honey, and the cabin attendant-styled Idol Honey. ; : :The leader of Panther Claw, who lusts for the Fixing Device hidden inside Honey's body and for her innocence, which she attempts to destroy, thereby corrupting Honey to evil. Her henchwomen are recruited from among young girls enarmored with her, whom Jill eventually transforms into her superpowered agents of evil. She uses white roses to inject them with a nanovirus, which turn blood-red when the transformation is completed. In order to get close to Honey, she poses as , a mysterious police inspector from France who has been assigned to help PCIS in their pursuit of Panther Claw. ; : :Honey's schoolmate and best friend. Initially only knowing about Honey's work for PCIS, she still suspected that Honey was not a normal person, but remains loyal to her. Unlike her manga version, she survives the Panther Claw assault on Saint Chapel in episode 6, and is subsequently entrusted by Honey with her full story. However, shortly afterwards she is captured by Jill and killed by Evil Tarantula Panther just before Honey can rescue her. ; : :Sister Jill's aide de camp. She features several arachnoid characteristics, concluding an additional abdomen and the ability to create weblines which perform a number of functions, including changing the appearance of any person (including herself) enveloped by them. Originally one of the girls fervently devoted to Jill, she gradually becomes disillusioned as she continues witnessing her mistress' cruelty even towards her own devotees and Natsuko's deep love for Honey. When she senses her growing doubts, Jill splits Tarantula into a good and evil half. Good Tarantula atones for her role in Natsuko's death by aiding Honey in her final battle, in which she and her evil half slay each other. ; : :One of Sister Jill's strongest fighters, she has the ability to form her legs and lower body into a dragon, complete with fire-breathing and flight abilities. Unlike most of her peers, she is more interested in a warrior's prowess rather than trying to win Jill's heart, and she is quite fond of Tarantula Panther. For these reasons, she sides with Honey against her former mistress during the final episodes arc, a choice for which she is killed by Sister Jill. This characterization is a complete reversal from her original manga version, where it was Dragon Panther who killed Natsuko and was subsequently slain by Jill for insubordination; a role which is filled by Snake Panther in the Universe series. ; : :In this series, Seiji is a member of PCIS, and an old acquaintance of Dr. Kisaragi. Whenever a case gets too difficult to handle for normal officers, he calls Honey to the scene. ; : :Danbei is the father of Seiji and Junpei and a millionaire, slightly perverted but with a strong sense of justice. ; : :Seiji's younger brother and his father's constant sidekick who shares his pervertedness and has an attraction to older women, including Honey and Genet. ; : :One of Seiji Hayami's assistants in the PCIS, and a former private investigator. ; and : :A pair of young and cheeky female mecha users and intelligence operatives in the PCIS. While effective, they tend to disrespect their superiors and make fun at their incompetence at every opportunity. ; : :The hulking, intimidating boss (\\"bancho\\") of a girl gang named the Sukeban at Saint Chapel Academy who act as an inofficial campus police force. Despite her rough looks and personality, she has a crush on Honey and is as a result quite jealous of Natsuko. During Panther Claw's assault on Saint Chapel, in revenge for the death of her entire gang and in order to protect Honey, she intercepts a deadly attack by Snake Panther and covers Honey and Natsuko's escape, apparently at the cost of her own life. However, thanks to her toughness she returns in the final episode to take the final fight to Sister Jill, and later joins Honey at their rebuilt school. ;Principal Pochi's Wife : :The wife of Saint Chapel's principal who is in a lesbian relationship with Alphonne. She is slain in her lover's arms when Panther Claw destroys Saint Chapel. ; : :Honey and Natsuko's homeroom teacher who is in a lesbian relationship with the principal's wife. She is slain in her lover's arms when Panther Claw destroys Saint Chapel. ; : :The sadistic superintendent of Saint Chapel whose cruel discipline, penchant for sadomasochism and habitual wielding of a whip have earned her the nickname \\"Histler\\". Unaware of Honey's alter ego as a super heroine, she often ends up punishing Natsuko whenever Honey is called away on a mission against Panther Claw. Like most of the others, she is killed during Panther Claw's assault on Saint Chapel. ;Dr. Kisaragi : :Honey's father, a scientist who copied the personality patterns of his dying daughter into her android form, into which he also integrated his invention, the Airborne Element Fixing Device. He was later killed by Panther Claw, who were after the device, shielding Honey from a fatal blow; it was also on that night that he taught Honey the secret of her powers. He was also the inventor of a gravity-based transportation device which is frequently used by Panther Claw for their attacks and escapes. ==Production== Cutie Honey Universe was first announced in December 2017 as part of creator Go Nagai's 50th anniversary as a manga artist. The anime is being directed by Akitoshi Yokoyama at Production Reed, with series composition by Natsuko Takahashi and character design and chief animation direction by Syuichi Iseki.

He was schooled in Stanley and left when he was 15 years old. After school he worked for Penguin News and then joined the Electricity and Telegraphs Department as a clerk. He became a member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force when he was 18 and during the Second World War he worked as a signalman at Sapper Hill and on board patrol ships. After studying accountancy via a correspondence course, Gleadell became clerk to Colonial Auditor Robert Boumphrey in 1947 and was then posted to the Colonial Audit Office in London and Gibraltar. He returned to the Falklands as Colonial Auditor in 1950 and married Mildred Lees, with whom he had a son, Graham. In 1959 he was promoted to Colonial Treasurer, the first islander to hold the post, and in 1961 he married his second wife, Vera Beal, with whom he had two children - Lois born in 1962 and Stephen born in 1964. ==Aerolineas Argentinas hijacking incident== In September 1966 Governor Cosmo Haskard was ordered to London for consultations and Colonial Secretary Harry Thompson (who would have normally deputised for the Governor) was on leave, meaning Gleadell was sworn in as Acting Governor. He later joked that he \\"enjoyed the fastest promotion in the colony's history, from private to commander-in-chief in one day\\". On 28 September 1966, Aerolineas Argentinas Flight 648 was hijacked en route from Buenos Aires to Rio Gallegos in Argentina by a group of Argentine nationalists and flown to the Falkland Islands where the hijackers took several Islanders hostage and claimed the islands to be Argentine territory. As acting Governor, Gleadell negotiated with the hijackers via a Spanish- speaking Catholic priest from St. Mary's Church, Father Rodolfo Roel. Fearing ordinary islanders might attempt to free the hostages by force, one of Gleadell's first acts was to prevent the armoury issuing any weapons to members of the public, insisting that only members of the defence force should be armed. Gleadell kept the UK government in London updated via telegram and after two days, the hijackers agreed to release the hostages and in return were deported to Argentina for trial (as they did not recognise the British authorities on the islands). As the hijackers departed the Falklands, Gleadell reportedly said \\"Well, I think I'm going to send a telegram saying I am going to sleep\\" as he had spent the previous four nights in his office. ==Later life== Gleadell was praised for his handling of the hijacking and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II at the 1967 New Year Honours. However, his involvement in the incident made him infamous in Argentine and he was pursued by the Argentina press in 1967 during a trip to Montevideo, where he had travelled for surgery to remove an ulcer. A few years later, whilst part of a trade delegation to mainland South America, a warrant was issued for his arrest in Tierra del Fuego on charges of 'deprivation of freedom, public intimidation, rebellion and theft', forcing him to return to the Falklands via Chile. Fearing for his children's safety (who were due to be educated in Argentina), in 1972 Gleadell and his family left the Falklands and emigrated to New Zealand, where he took up work as an accountant for a hardware store. He retired in the 1980s and died in Auckland on 13 June 2009. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Falkland Islands emigrants to New Zealand Category:Falkland Islands people of English descent Category:Governors of the Falkland Islands Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Fox Bay ","title":"Les Gleadell"},{"id":"56555084","text":"Around the Corner is a 1930 American comedy-drama film directed by Bert Glennon and starring George Sidney, Charles Murray and Joan Peers.Fetrow p.25 ==Cast== * George Sidney as Kaplan * Charles Murray as O'Grady * Joan Peers as Rosie * Charles Delaney as Terry Callahan * Larry Kent as Tommy Sinclair * Jesse De Vorska as Moe Levine * Frederick Sullivan as Sinclair Sr * Harry Strang as Mac ==ReferencesBibliography== * Alan G.

The number of councillors is determined by population count: 6 councillors for population under 500; 8 councillors for population between 500 and 1,500; 10 councillors for population between 1,500 and 3,000; and 12 councillors for population over 3,000. Councillors were elected in single multi-member districts, consisting of the municipality's territory, using an open list proportional representation system. Voting was on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot. The mayors were elected in a two-round system. If none of the candidates achieved a majority in the first round, a second round would have been held four weeks later, where the candidate with a plurality would be elected as a mayor.Gesetz vom 11.

He made his List A debut for Uttar Pradesh in the 2017–18 Vijay Hazare Trophy on 11 February 2018. Prior to his List A debut, he was named in India National Under-19 cricket team for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Juyal made his International debut against South Africa in the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Christchurch, New Zealand. ==Early life== Juyal was born in a family of doctors. When he was in class III, he was selected in the school team in his hometown, Haldwani, Uttarakhand. By the time Juyal was in class V, it was apparent that his talent needed to be taken seriously. While playing a tournament in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, Juyal was spotted by Ravindra Negi, a coach at Abhumanya Cricket Academy and upon Negi's proposal, junior Juyal's father, Dr. Sanjay Juyal enrolled him at this Academy. After an initial period of adjustment, the 11 year old Juyal settled into the residential cricket academy, which like the many boarding schools nestled in Dehradun, polished his raw talent into the finished product. Juyal started making regular appearances in the Uttar Pradesh Under-14 and Under-16 teams. After two years at Dehradun, Juyal moved to Moradabad, where his mother’s family stayed. From there he would travel to Delhi, often staying in the capital for five days at a time. He trained at LB Shastri Cricket Club under Sanjay Bharadwaj, gaining match experience. At their home in Haldwani, Juyal's father has built an indoor enclosure with one turf and one artificial wicket, and enough space for bowlers to take a full run up. In the monsoons when Juyal would not be able to play outdoors, he would go back to Haldwani to train at the indoor enclore at home. ==Career== Juyal made his debut in the Under-19 category for Uttar Pradesh. With 401 runs from five innings, he topped the batting charts for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy in 2017, and was in the top five of the Vinoo Mankad inter-zonal trophy. These performances earned him a slot in the Challenger Trophy, where he was the fourth highest run getter with 171 runs in four innings. In 2017 Juyal was selected for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup team, only the second uncapped player in the side. In this tournament, India won the finals against Australia on 3 February 2018, India's fourth U19 World Cup, the most by any team. He made his Twenty20 debut for Uttar Pradesh in the 2018–19 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on 2 March 2019. In November 2019, he was named in India's squad for the 2019 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup in Bangladesh. He made his first-class debut on 9 December 2019, for Uttar Pradesh in the 2019–20 Ranji Trophy. ==Honours== After his debut in the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup team, Juyal along with his coach Negi was honoured by the Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in Dehradun. ==References * Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:Indian cricketers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Uttar Pradesh cricketers ","title":"Aryan Juyal"},{"id":"56555321","text":"The reservoir Schwanenteich Aubach is a river of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

The case was eventually dismissed by the court on the grounds that his mandate had already expired. ==Impeachment process== The President of the Czech Republic can only be impeached in the case of an act of treason (which is not defined in the constitution itself). The process must be initiated in the Senate, which has the exclusive power to impeach the president, and then passes to the Constitutional Court, which determines whether the President is guilty or not. If the president is found guilty then they are stripped of their office and may not be elected president again.Ústava České republiky. Psp.cz. Retrieved 2013-07-12. ==Background== Václav Klaus was elected in 2003 and won his second term in 2008. His term ended in March 2013 as he was ineligible to run for another term. Before his term ended, he announced an amnesty to mark the 20th anniversary of the Czech Republic's independence. The amnesty took effect on 2 January and released all prisoners sentenced to one year or less whose sentences had not been served, and all prisoners over 75 years of age sentenced to ten years or less whose sentences had not been served, as well as cancelling all court proceedings which had been ongoing for longer than eight years. The amnesty was widely criticised by the public. The amnesty sparked a public petition to persuade the Czech Senate to charge President Klaus with treason before the Constitutional court, effectively impeaching him. Within 24 hours of its launch, it had collected 24,500 signatures, and by the beginning of February 2013, the petition had been signed by more than 64,000 people. ==Impeachment== The process started on 4 March 2013, three days before Klaus' term expired. 38 Senators voted in favour, and 30 voted against. The court rejected the motion as Klaus' term had already expired and he thus could not be charged with treason. ==Reactions== Constitutional experts were uncertain whether the former President could be impeached. Some experts suggested that the motion had little chance of success as Klaus' actions were unlikely to be considered treason. However, Jan Kudrna expressed the view that the motion had some chance. Severe conducted a survey of Czech lawyers as to whether Klaus was guilty; 75% responded that he was not guilty while 16.7% responded that he was. Klaus' successor Miloš Zeman, who had not agreed with the amnesty, described the impeachment attempt as a \\"hysterical reaction\\" and \\"absurd\\". He noted that treason is not clearly defined by the Constitution but amnesty is a constitutional power given to the President by the Constitution. Miroslav Kalousek, known as a vehement opponent of Klaus' politics, condemned the impeachment attempt as \\"gigantic stupidity\\". == References == Category:Václav Klaus Category:Trials of political people Category:Trials in the Czech Republic Category:2013 in the Czech Republic Category:Impeachment ","title":"Impeachment of Václav Klaus"},{"id":"56555352","text":"Watson Fernando was a Sri Lankan communist politician and trade unionist.Daily News. Obituaries He served as president of the Ceylon Communist Party (Peking Wing) and was a member of the Moratuwa Municipal Council. ==Early political and labour activism== Fernando worked as mercantile clerk. He rose to become a district-level leader of the Communist Party. In the first parliamentary election of 1947 he contested the Moratuwa Electoral District seat. He obtained 722 votes (2.58%). He was a leader during the Hartal of 1953. As of 1958 he served as Vice President of the All Ceylon Toddy Workers' Union (CTUF affiliate, with M.G. Mendis as President). He again contested the Morutuwa seat in the March 1960 parliamentary election, obtaining 1,091 votes (4.49%). ==Sino-Soviet split== Fernando became president of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation after the split in the Communist Party in 1963. He had sided with the pro-China faction in the split. In 1964 he held the post of Ratmalana District Committee secretary of the party and was one of 116 signatories to the declaration that marked the definitive split of the party into two groups.Marxists.org. To All Marxist-Leninists Inside the Ceylon Communist Party ==UF government and formation of CPSL(M-L)== Fernando led a split in the party in 1972. Fernando criticized the party leader N. Shanmugathasan's opposition to the United Front government, arguing that UF was a 'progressive force'. Whilst the party leader N. Shanmugathasan was abroad in Albania in April 1972, Fernando tried to seize control over the party. Fernando led a meeting on July 10 that declared N. Shanmugathasan expelled from the party. N. Shanmugathasan replied by summoning the party Central Committee on September 22, which declared Fernando expelled. Fernando's faction regrouped and at a meeting on November 12, 1972 it took the name Communist Party of Sri Lanka (Marxist-Leninist). Fernando sought to bring the Maoist movement closer to the UF orbit, but his faction remained a minor group compared to N. Shanmugathasan's party. Just like the main pro-China Communist Party, Fernando's CPSL(ML) sought to maintain contacts with the Communist Party of China. ==Family== He was married to Milna Fernando, the couple had two sons. ==References== Category:Sri Lankan communists Category:Sri Lankan municipal councillors Category:Sri Lankan politicians Category:Sri Lankan trade unionists Category:Year of birth missing Category:Possibly living people ","title":"Watson Fernando"},{"id":"56555354","text":"Local elections were held in Liechtenstein in 1991 to elect the municipal councils and the mayors of the eleven municipalities. ==Election system== The municipal councils (German: Gemeinderat) are composed of an even number of councillors plus the mayor (German: Gemeindevorsteher).

He is the grandson of James Calata, one of the founding members of the South African Native National Congress. James Calata was also Secretary General from 1936 to 1949. Fort Calata started school in 1963 when he went to St James, then proceeded to Macembe Lower Primary and then Nxuba Higher Primary. He completed his matriculation at Cradock Secondary School. He joined a band called the Ambassadors in 1972 and became its drummer and guitarist. He met Nomonde Calata in 1974 and they married in 1980. Calata completed his Secondary Teachers Diploma at Lennox Sebe Teachers College, now known as Griffiths Mxenge College. His specialties were Accounting, Business Economics and Afrikaans. == Work and politics == Calata started work in 1979 at Dimbaza High School in Ciskei. Together with some teachers at the school, they formed a burial society which served as an underground cell. He was arrested in 1980 together with 32 students for his political activities and was detained for a month. Calata taught Afrikaans and Xhosa for standards 6 and 7 at Sam Xhali Secondary in 1981. He met Matthew Goniwe and they became friends and comrades. In 1983, the Cradock Youth Association (CRADOYA) was launched and Calata became its secretary. Their first task was to stand against what they deemed were unfair rental systems that were proposed by the Eastern Cape Administration Board. In November 1983, Calata was part of the ‘’’Release Mandela Campaign’’’. His wife, Nomonde Calata, lost her job at the Cradock Provincial Hospital after she was found wearing the campaign t-shirt. She was charged with 3 months in prison or a fine of R800. In December 1983, he received a letter from the government notifying him of his removal from permanent staff at Sam Xhali and placed on probation for 12 months. In January 1984, students started a boycott after they learned of the expulsion of Goniwe from Sam Xhali. Due to Calata’s involvement in politics and relations with Goniwe, he was also targeted by the security police. Calata was then detained on 31 March 1984 together with Matthew Goniwe, Mbulelo Goniwe and Fezile Madoda Jacobs. They were detained at Diepkloof Prison which was previously known as Fort Prison. This was the same place his grandfather was detained in during the Treason Trial in 1956. Calata was informed on 21 August while in detention that he was dismissed from his teaching post due to violating the Education Act of 1979. That same month, the community launched a week long boycott of white owned shops in protest against the detention of community leaders. Calata and 10 others were then released on 10 October 1984. Upon his release, he continued his political activities and was involved in mass actions against apartheid education and other discriminatory laws including Black Local Authorities, the Tricameral Parliament and influx control. == Death and memory == On 26 June 1985, during the celebration of the Freedom Charter, Calata addressed a crowd at Lingelihle community hall. The following day Calata, Goniwe, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlauli drove to Port Elizabeth to attend a United Democratic Front meeting. They did not return home and their burnt car and mutilated bodies were found a week after their disappearance. Calata died of stab wounds to his chest on 27 June 1985 near Bluewater Bay in Port Elizabeth. At that time, Nomonde Calata was six months pregnant with their daughter, Thamani. A funeral was held for Goniwe, Calata, Mkhonto and Mhlauli on 20 July 1985 where Allan Boesak, Beyers Naudé and Steve Tshwete gave keynote addresses. A message from the then president of the ANC Oliver Tambo was read. A memorial was erected in honour of The Cradock Four Calata was awarded the Order of Luthuli by the South African Presidency for “Outstanding contribution and dedicating his life to a free, just and democratic South Africa”. == References  External links == * Biography of Fort Calata at thecradockfour.co.za * About the Cradock four at cradock4.co.za * The story behind the Cradock Four picture at heraldlive.co.za Category:1956 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Anti-apartheid activists Category:Deaths by stabbing in South Africa Category:Xhosa people Category:Members of the Order of Luthuli ","title":"Fort Calata"},{"id":"56555501","text":"The Orofino Historic District is a historic district in Orofino, Idaho which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

It is a Grade II* listed building. ==History and description== Fox and Raglan, writing in the first volume of their three- volume study Monmouthshire Houses, considered that the original house could \\"hardly be later than c.1500\\". A later survey by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales suggested an earlier date from the 14th century. In 1948, when Fox and Raglan visited, they described it as \\"suitable for Little Red Riding Hood's grandmamma to live in\\", noting its almost complete state. By the middle of the 20th century, however, the house was derelict. It was restored in 1990-1995. The architectural historian John Newman described Pwll as a \\"two-unit cruck-truss hall house\\". The house is constructed of rubble, timber and brick, and is of two storeys with a modern tiled roof.

The weapon is designed as a multi-role assault weapon aiming to provide anti-armor, anti-fortification, anti-personnel capability. Designed and manufactured by Norinco for People's Liberation Army, Type 08 is the successor to Type 89A multipurpose rocket launcher. ==Description== The Type 08 has a unique firing mechanism called hermetic balance projection () possibly inspired by C.Davis recoilless principle. Compare to the previous system, Type 08 utilizes countermass to reduce the recoil, noise, muzzle flash, pressure wave and back blast that can cause burns and overpressure as well as creating conspicuous launch signature of the user. Moreover, Type 08's multipurpose ammunition has a relatively small blast radius of 7 meters, which gives the weapon system a minimum range of 25 meters. Thus, a soldier can fire the weapon more safely inside confined spaces. The high-explosive ammunition of DZJ-08 is specially designed to penetrate structures. It can penetrates 25 mm of steel armor at 65° angle, or around 30 mm of steel armor at 90° angle. Although it is not effective against heavy vehicle, lightly armored vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers, can still be penetrated and destroyed by DJZ-08. The biggest improvement of DZJ-08 is the ability to penetrates 500 mm of reinforced concrete, whereas the predecessor PF-89A with its multipurpose round can only penetrate 300mm of reinforced concrete. Type 08 is China's first attempt to develop an anti-tank weapon that can be used in confined space and urban warfare. China used Type 89 rocket launcher to replace Type 69 RPG in the 90s, however the problem of back blast became prominent. Since May 2000, Norinco started to design a new generation of weapon that is portable, single-use and can be distributed to each individual soldier of infantry squad like Type 89 yet offers low collateral damage. DZJ-08 weights 7.6kg, is water-proof and features a fordable day sight. The weapon also has folding front-grip and carrying handle. Firing instruction is printed on the left side of the launch tube. ==Users== * : People's Liberation Army ==See also== * AT-4 CS * Davis gun * Recoilless gun ==References== Category:Weapons of the People's Republic of China Category:Anti-tank rockets ","title":"DZJ-08"},{"id":"56555656","text":"Jay Odedra (born 5 November 1989) is an Omani cricketer.

It was shot on the island of Fårö and is about its inhabitants. ==Subject== Speaking in 1969, Bergman identifies Fårö as a small island near Gotland, with a population of 754, down from 1,100 40 years previously; it was merged into the larger Gotland municipality. Erland Wallin, mayor, says in an interview the people of outlying areas outside of urban centres often feel neglected. Bergman draws his conclusion the people of Fårö lack equality compared to others in urban areas: the youth lack a gathering place, schools lack funding, families have no daycare, and interviewee Arvid Andersson is frustrated that his efforts to have a bridge built over Fårö Sound achieve no results. Bergman also called for subsidies for the island's farmers. ==Production== Ingmar Bergman and Sven Nykvist shot on Fårö on numerous occasions. Bergman shot numerous films on Fårö, including Through a Glass Darkly (1961), Persona (1966), Hour of the Wolf (1968), Shame (1968), The Passion of Anna (1969), and The Touch (1971); however, whereas the others use the island for symbolism and have been termed the \\"island films\\", Fårö Document is a documentary. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist shot the documentary on 16 mm film. The Fårö Document production crew consisted of five people and the interviews and photography lasted between 15 March and 1 May 1969. ==Broadcast and release== Fårö Document initially aired on Swedish television on 1 January 1970, with approximately three million viewers. Outside Sweden, its availability was limited, but the Paley Center for Media in New York City made the film available with English subtitles. In 2018, The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray in Region A, along with 38 other Bergman films, in the set Ingmar Bergman's Cinema. == Sequel== A second documentary, Fårö Document 1979, followed in 1979. Bergman shot the follow-up film observing the lives of the locals, including shearing sheep and carrying out other chores. Criterion included a Blu-ray version of the follow-up documentary in Ingmar Bergman's Cinema. ==References== Bibliography * * ==External link== * Category:1970 films Category:1970 documentary films Category:Films directed by Ingmar Bergman Category:Gotland Category:Swedish-language films Category:Swedish documentary films Category:Swedish films ","title":"Fårö Document"},{"id":"56555699","text":"CJFB Performance Award is a Bangladeshi film and music award made by the Cultural Journalists' Forum of Bangladesh.

He established a zinc and bronze foundry in his own name in Copenhagen in 1865 and was appointed royal court caster in 1883. Many Danish monuments from the second half of the 19th century come from his foundry. It was later taken over by his son Carl Rasmussen and remained in the family for several generations. ==Early life and education== Rasmussen was born on 11 June 1824 in Copenhagen, the son of shopkeeper Niels Rasmussen (1787–1854) and Ane Nielsdatter (1784–1863). In 1839 he became a brazier's apprentice under court brazier H. Dalhoff, a brother of J. B. Dalhoff. He completed his apprenticeship in 1844 and then the following year, together with a couple of friends, went abroad to practice his trade. He initially travelled to Berlin by way of Stettin and then continued to Warsaw. From there he continued alone to Meissen, Munich, Milan and Constantinople. In Munich he took part in the casting of Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler's monumental Bavaria statue. Rasmussen was awarded the title of royal court caster in 1883 and his foundry was listed as Purveyor to the Court of Denmark. ==Career== After eight years as a journeyman in Europe, Rasmussen finally returned to Copenhagen in 1852 where he established a small business as a font caster in his father's cellar. After his father's death in 1854, Rasmussen established a zinc and bronze foundry at Åbenrå 2. Rasmussen's technical skill was soon noticed by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. In 1859 the foundry relocated to larger premises at Sankt Annæ Gade 34 in Christianshavn and eight years later to Læssøesgade 14 in Nørrebro. ==Other pursuits== From 1875 Rasmussen was a member of Industriforeningen's board of representatives. In 1883 he became the president of the board of representatives of Kreditforeningen af Haandværkere og Industridrivende. He also served as vice chairman of Foreningen til lærlinges uddannelse. ==Personal life== Rasmussen married Auguste Emilie Rost (25 January 1829 – 15 May 1885) on 30 April 1855 in Meissen. She was the daughter of vineyard-owner and innkeeper Johann Karl Gottlob Rost (died 1833) and Christiane Friederike Götzin. ==Legacy== Later history of the company Rasmussen's foundry was taken over by his son Carl Rasmussen (1863–1936) and Herman Rasmussen. They moved the foundry to larger premises at Rådmandsgade 16 in 1897. Herman Rasmussen left the company in 1900. Carl Rasmussen's son Poul Lauritz Rasmussen (1897–1980), became a partner in the company in 1920 and its sole owner after his father's death in 1936. His son H.

During his school years he played football for 'Grażyna', which was part of the 'Sokół' (\\"Falcon\\") Polish Gymnastic Society. == Military service == Having voluntarily joined the military forces in 1935, he took his military oath and after becoming a qualified pilot, he joined the 2nd Air Force Regiment in Rakowice-Czyżyny, Kraków as a member of the 24th Combat Squadron. September 1939 During the invasion of Poland, the Luftwaffe destroyed his military base and although Maciej was a trained pilot, he did not take part in combat at this stage.: > In September 1938, thanks to flying officer Tadeusz Nowierski, I was > temporarily transferred from the 24th Combat Squadron to a training unit in > order to become a piloting instructor.

French campaign Equipped with new documents, Ludwik Maciej managed to get from Romania to France. There he was trained to fly light bombers, most of which represented the older type of aircraft, 'Amiot 143', 'Farman F.220' and 'Bloch MB.210' to name a few, with the exception of 'Potez 63-11', which was a relatively new aircraft. The training course, originally took place in Rennes, later transferred to Clermont-Ferrand due to the German advancement towards Brittany. At the beginning of June 1940, Ludwik Maciej was again transferred to Toulouse, where the training was concluded. Battle of Britain When France capitulated, he boarded the ship at the port of Saint Jean de Luz and arrived in Liverpool. Eventually he travelled to the Bramcote Royal Air Force station, where he was trained to undertake night-time flights on Vickers Wellington bombers. Later, under the command of Lt Col Wacław Makowski, Ludwik Maciej became a bomber pilot in No. 300 'Land of Masovia' Bomber Squadron, which remained part of the Royal Air Force until the end of the war. He took part in various missions of the squadron between August 1940 and June 12, 1941. It was during the night on the return flight from a bombing mission of the Ruhr industrial area, that his aircraft was shot over Düsseldorf. With a damaged engine, he managed to get as far as the English Channel, where he was forced to ditch into the North Sea. With an injured leg, he and the remaining members of his crew were taken prisoner by a German crew aboard a Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boat. Captivity Having undergone treatment at the hospital in Amsterdam, as Prisoner 39140, Ludwik Maciej was later held captive in a number of pilots' prisoner-of-war camps – in Frankfurt am Main, at Bad Sulza in Thuringia, at Stalag Luft III in Żagań, at Stalag Luft VII in Bąków near Częstochowa and at Stalag Luft IV in Tychowo. As a result of mass executions and inhuman conditions, each of these camps were responsible for the death of thousands of people. At the beginning of 1945, surviving prisoners were evacuated and three months later, having travelled via Kołobrzeg, Świnoujście, Schwerin, Luneburg and Celle, they reached Lutov, where they were liberated by the British army. == Orders and military awards == Ludwik Maciej was awarded the following orders and military awards: The War Order of Virtuti Militari, The Cross of Valor (three times), The September Campaign Cross, The 'Poland to Her Defender' Medal, as well as a number of international medals, including 1939-1945 Star, Air Crew Europe Star, France and Germany Star, War Medal 1939-1945, International Prisoners Of War, and the Croix de Guerre. On December 5, 2005, Warrant Officer Ludwik Maciej was awarded the title of The Honorary Citizen of Czechowice-Dziedzice by the City Council of Czechowice- Dziedzice. == Personal life == Grave of Ludwik Maciej in Czechowice-Dziedzice After the war, Ludwik Maciej stayed in England and settled in the city of Lincoln.

The line currently runs between the Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport and Nagyvárad tér metro station. The route is served by BKK and operated by BKV Zrt. ==History== On 6 September 2008 as part of the BKV transit system overhaul, Route 200 was replaced by Route 200E. The new bus line did not stop at Billentyű utca stop. Between 21 June and 24 August in 2011 the buses ran to Határ út instead of Kőbánya-Kispest terminus. Since 30 May 2012 do not serve the closed Terminal 1 of Liszt ferenc International Airport. Route 200E stops at Billentyű utca since 1 May 2013. The passengers have to board at first door since October 5, 2013. The buses stop at the Aeropark Repülőmúzeum since 3 June 2017, and at Pestszentlőrinc vasútállomás (átjáró) since 19 March 2018. As of June 2018, 200E operates continuously (24/7).

Having spent seven years as Second Mistress at Nottingham High School for Girls, she was appointed head of Cardiff Intermediate School for Girls (later Cardiff High School for Girls) in 1895, when the school first opened; she retained the post until 1924. She gathered well qualified teachers to her school, including Beatrice May Baker, who copied her approach when leading Badminton School to be more progressive. Collin's position in the community enabled her to command respect as a leader of the women's suffrage movement. As a head teacher, she supported the teaching of mathematics and science to girls, and advocated that school inspectors should themselves have a teaching qualification.

It has wide but short semicircular fins which are shorter than the mantle length either anteriorly or posteriorly. At their posterior ends the fins are widely separated while their anterior origin is behind the margin of the mantle. The suckers on the non-hectocotylised arms are arranged similarly in both sexes in four series. In the males there are around 10 enlarged suckers in the ventral rows of arms II to IV which run towards the tip from the third or fourth suckers counting from the head. The males have a hectocotylus in which the upper half of left dorsal arm is modified with enlarged pedicels to the suckers which are densely packed to form 2 double rows of columnar structures and the suckers are reduced, having very small, fleshy, narrow openings. The inner end of this arm has a single papilla which resembles a nipple. The marginal suckers on arm I are slightly larger than the medial suckers. The tentacular club suckers are cup-shaped or spherical. There is no internal gladius. There are a pair of saddle-shaped bioluminescent organs present in the inside of the mantle cavity on the ink sac. The colour varies from an iridescent gold through to purple, with large black chromatophores. They grow up to 40mm in mantle length. This species is sympatric with and very similar to Euprymna berryi and the females of E. morsei and E. berryi are indistinguishable from one another. ==Distribution== Euprymna morsei is found from southern Japan south along the coasts of Korea and China to Malaysia and as far south as Java, a distribution encompassing East and South China Seas, the Yellow Sea, Gulf of Thailand and the Philippines. There have been possible records from the Bay of Bengal and the Maldive Islands, but the Bay of Bengal records, at least, were based on females and are, therefore, uncertain. However, there is taxonomic uncertainty about the definition of E. morsei and other authorities have stated that this is a temperate species which is only found in the colder seas around Japan. The taxonomy of the genus Euprymna remains to be resolved to define its species limits. ==Biology== Euprymna morsei is a shallow water species which spends the day buried in soft substrates and emerge at night to feed, using their bioluminescent organs to emit just enough light to disguise their silhouette from predators such as lancet fish (Alepisaurus ferox). ==Fisheries== Euprymna morsei is fished for food on a very small, local scale and sometimes taken as bycatch by fisheries. ==References== Category:Bobtail squid Category:Molluscs described in 1881 ","title":"Euprymna morsei"},{"id":"56555838","text":"Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositers (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999 is an act of Maharashtra state legislature to protect the interest of depositers of Maharashtra state in the financial establishments and matters relating thereto.

It is sometimes written as ARHGEF42, FLJ00018. The PLEKHG2 protein is a huge protein of about 1300 amino acids, 130 kDa and has a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain near the N terminus of its structure. The DH domain is a domain responsible for guanine nucleotide exchange activity that converts GDP on the Rho family Small GTPase (RhoGTPase) to GTP, and PLEKHG2 having this domain also acts as a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF). Activation of RhoGTPase reconstitute the actin cytoskeleton and changes the cell morphology, so PLEKHG2 might be contributes to cell motility and neuronal network development of neurons via RhoGTPase and actin remodeling (see later). == Cloning == Recombinant BXH2 and AKXD inbred mice mutated by retroviral transduction are known to develop myeloid leukemia, B cell and T cell leukemia at high frequency. In 2002, Himmel et al., used this model of acute myelogenous leukemia and showed that a novel Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor gene is contained downstream of the retroviral uptake site called Evi24. They named this gene Clg. Hemmel and colleagues cloned Clg and showed homology with PLEKHG2 contained in human chromosome 19 chromosome 19q13.1 region. From these observations they pointed out association with acute myeloid leukemia. == Functions == In a paper published by Hemmel et al., in 2002, they showed that a construct containing a DH-PH domain of Clg promotes guanine nucleotide exchange of Cdc42 but does not promote guanine nucleotide exchange of Rac1 or RhoA. In addition, DH-PH domains or full-length Clg were introduced into NIH3T3 cells and transformation occurred. Later, Ueda and his colleagues introduced the expression construct of full-length human PLEKHG2 into HEK 293 cells. In this cell the Gβγ subunit of the trimeric G protein were interacted with PLEKHG2 directly. Ueda and colleagues also showed that PLEKHG2 were activated by Gbg and PLEKHG2 activates Rac1, Cdc42 of RhoGTPase and contributes to cell morphological change. In 2013, Runne et al., showed that PLEKHG2 is elevated in several leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat T cells. In addition, they showed that GPCR signal-dependent activation of Rac and Cdc42 regulates the chemotaxis of lymphocytes via actin polymerization. From this observation PLEKHG2 was considered to an important regulator of cell motility. Furthermore, in recent years, it has become clear that PLEKHG2 undergoes regulation through modification such as phosphorylation and interaction with other proteins by various intracellular signals (see the section on interaction / protein modification). However, the function in vivo is still unclear. == Disease related with PLEKHG2 == In 2016, Edvardson et al., identified homozygosity for Arg204Trp mutation in the PLEKHG2 gene in the patients with dystonia or postnatal microcephaly. == Interactions == PLEKHG2 is known to interacted with the following proteins. ・Gβγ ・β-actin ・Four and a Half LIM domain1 (FHL1) ・Gαs == protein modification == It is known that PLEKHG2 undergoes modification such as phosphorylation by the following signals. ・SRC ・EGFR == References == :Category:Genes :Category:Proteins :Category:Molecular biology ","title":"PLEKHG2"},{"id":"56556165","text":"Strmen is a village in central Croatia, in the municipality of Sunja, Sisak- Moslavina County.

A prize is awarded in her memory by the Royal Society of Medicine's History of Medicine Society. ==Early life== Norah Schuster was born on 14 July 1892, the daughter of the German-born British physicist Arthur Schuster who was the first to report the findings of Wilhelm Röntgen about X-rays in the United Kingdom. Later in life, Norah described her father's initial uses of bedside X-rays taken in Manchester in 1896. He gave public lectures on the new technique which Norah and her brother attended, X-rays of their hands and feet being used to illustrate the proceedings for which a ten minute exposure was required due to the weakness of the rays. Feeling that she could not succeed in pure science, and possibly overshadowed by her eminent father, in 1911 she enrolled as a medical student at the University of Manchester. She was the first woman to take the pre- clinical course at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, between 1912 and 1915,Schuster, Norah (1892–1991).

Retrieved 11 February 2018. and she qualified in medicine at the University of Manchester in 1918 and was awarded a gold medal. She was appointed assistant pathologist at the MRI in the same year, partly because of the continuing shortage of male doctors caused by the war and not without some opposition to the idea, thus becoming the first woman to be employed as a doctor by the hospital since its establishment in 1752. She became a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1922. A few years later, in 1925, she married the surgeon Marriott Fawckner Nicholls but continued to practise using her maiden name. After completing her medical studies, she left Manchester and took up junior resident posts at the Queen's Hospital for Children, Hackney Road, and St George's Hospital, London. She was pathologist at The Infants Hospital, Vincent Square, London, and assistant curator at the museum of St George's Hospital. In 1927, Schuster was selected to be pathologist to the Royal Chest Hospital, London. In addition, she also worked for the Emergency Medical Service during the Second World War, and at Pinewood Hospital, Berkshire. Later, she became a founder fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists and was the first woman president of the Association of Clinical Pathologists in 1950. ==Writing== Schuster produced several medical papers but most of her writing was about the history of medicine. She was vice-president of the History of Medicine Society (previously section), at the Royal Society of Medicine for many years, and \\"remembered fondly as 'an elegant, intelligent lady sitting in the front row\\" at meetings. After the closure of the Royal Chest Hospital in 1954, she began to research its history as a result of which she wrote a paper in which she attempted to restore the reputation of the hospital's founder, Isaac Buxton, whom she felt had been unfairly criticised in Sir Ernest William Morris's History of the London Hospital. The resulting article was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine in April 1955.

As artistic director of Brussels based dance company Kobalt Works since 2000, Arco Renz creates choreographies in Europe and Asia, as well as commissioned works for Opera Houses and institutional companies around the world. An important aspect of Arco Renz’ activities is his engagement in projects promoting the development of research and exchange between European and Asian artists: Between 2011-2016, Arco Renz engaged in collaborative performance projects of very different nature in Cambodia (CRACK), Indonesia (solid.states + KRIS IS), Vietnam (Hanoi Stardust), the Philippines (COKE), Singapore/Thailand (ALPHA), Hong Kong/Korea (EAST). Monsoon, a series of research and collaboration platforms bringing together Asian and European artists is an on-going project with editions in Europe, Asia and Australia. A central focus within aRco’s specific choreographic idiom is the comparative study of various body practices originating in Asia and Europe. He teaches dance and choreography in numerous institutions around the world.

He belonged to the first group of graduates from P.A.R.T.S.. == Artistic director of Kobalt Works == In 2000 Arco Renz founded the company Kobalt Works in Brussels. One of the focal points of the company are collaborative projects and performances between European and Asian artists. Arco Renz and his company have since created more than 25 full-length choreographies and a series of commissioned works.Page about Kobalt Works on the website of Kobalt Works An important aspect of their activities is the involvement in transcultural and interdisciplinary research and collaboration projects. Over the years Arco Renz and Kobalt Works have built a broad network with important performing arts organizations in Asia; they realized collaborations with performers from, among others, Cambodia, the Philippines, India, Java and Vietnam. His love for pure, formal dance and his interest in traditional Eastern theater techniques are a recurring element in his oeuvre, in which he seeks a relationship with both Eastern and Western dance. Arco Renz concentrates on the shared space between Eastern and Western forms of movement. His interest in the East goes back to his student days in Paris. There he saw Chinese opera and Noh theatre. He also became acquainted with Qigong and Tai chi. During his first trip through Asia in 1994, he became fascinated by the energy of the Indian Kathakali dance theater. According theater scholar / critic Lieve Dierckx he deliberately circumvents the pitfalls of exoticism or postcolonial stereotypes in the contact between East and West. In creation processes he therefore places himself rather in the role of catalyst and guide than of choreographer. He prefers to depart from the individual freedom of the performer than from pre-established principles. An example of his collaboration in Asia is that in 2011 in Phnom Penh with Amrita Performing Arts. This institution is committed to the revival of classical Cambodian dance and music after the damage caused by the Khmer Rouge. Arco Renz introduced the dance students to contemporary dance forms. He also made his performance Crack (Arco Renz / Kobalt Works, 2011) with a number of them.Page about Crack (Arco Renz / Kobalt Works, 2011) on the website of STUKIsabelle Finet, Een nieuw seizoen in Cambodja - Crack van Arco Renz, in: Etcetera, nr. 128, p. 4-9Emilie Boulengier, Dance in its natural state, in The Phnom Penh Post, Dec 10-16, 2010, p. 9De dans die zelfs de Rode Khmer overleefde - 'Crack': de derde adem van de klassieke Cambodjaanse dans, in: De Standaard, 24 March 2012, p.

She attended Holland Park Comprehensive, a school some reporters dubbed \\"The UK's School for Jihadis\\", when the press realized that multiple graduates appeared to have an association with terrorism. El-Wahabi and Davis met at her mosque's daycare, when they were 19 years old. The pair had two children together. Prior to his July 2013 departure for occupied Syria Davis had worked as a drug dealer, and was convicted on drug and weapons charges. ==Terrorism== El-Wahabi was convicted of funding terrorism, for trying to send 20,000 euros to her husband, Aine Lesley Davis, described in court as a fighter to the short-lived Daesh \\"Islamic State\\". After his departure el- Wahabi had asked a friend, from Holland Park Comprehensive, Nawal Msaad, to smuggle the funds to Turkey, in her underwear. The Mirror], and other newspapers reporting on the trial, described Msaad as having been duped into smuggling funds, without realizing the funds were intended to support terrorism. Msaad was acquitted. El-Wahabi, on the other hand, was believed to know that funds sent to Davis would be supporting terrorism, and was convicted. In November 2014, el-Wahabi received a 28-month sentence, only half of which she would have to serve in custody. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:British people of Moroccan descent Category:British prisoners and detainees Category:People educated at Holland Park School Category:People imprisoned on charges of terrorism Category:Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales ","title":"Amal el-Wahabi"},{"id":"56557167","text":"The discography of American rapper Takeoff consists of one studio album, one upcoming collaborative mixtape, four singles and two other charted songs.

The market originated as a regular gathering of vintage vehicle enthusiasts, led by Seksak Sangsuwan, who is now its manager. The gatherings began in the 1990s in the area of the Royal Plaza, and moved to Makkhawan Rangsan Bridge and Bang Krabue before settling on the corner of Ratchada–Lat Phrao Intersection, where it became known as the Ratchada Night market. Retail activity began with exchanges of parts and collectable vintage items, and gradually expanded to serve a large number of visitors. In 2012, to make way for development work on Suan Lum Night Bazaar Ratchadaphisek, the market moved into the JJ Green community mall near Chatuchak Park, and in 2015, with 100 million-baht (US$3 million) in investment from business tycoon Chatchawal Kong-udom and a 30-year lease from the State Railway of Thailand, it reopened as the Siam Gypsy Junction at Bang Son. ==References== Category:Night markets in Bangkok Category:2015 establishments in Thailand Category:Bang Sue District ","title":"Siam Gypsy Junction"},{"id":"56557281","text":"Roman Yeremin (born 14 January 1997) is a Kazakhstani biathlete.

She was one of the best juvenile fillies in England in 1908 when she won four of her seven races, including the Woodcote Stakes, as well as being placed behind Bayardo in both the New Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year she finished third in the 1000 Guineas and then recorded her biggest win in the Oaks Stakes. In early 1910 she was sold and exported to France to become a broodmare. ==Background== Perola was a chestnut mare bred in England by the Australian baronet Sir Daniel Cooper and owned during her racing career by Cooper's younger brother William. She was trained by Saunders Davies-Scourfield at Myrtle Grove in Sussex. She was sired by Persimmon, whose wins included the Derby, St Leger, Eclipse Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup and who went on to be British champion sire on four occasions. Perola's dam Edmee was a female-line descendant of the St Leger winner Caller Ou. ==Racing career== 1908: two-year-old season Perola was ridden in most of her early races by the American jockey Danny Maher. She recorded her first success when she produced a \\"rare rush\\" of speed to win the Woodcote Stakes over five furlongs at Epsom Racecourse on Derby day 1908. Two weeks later at Royal Ascot she came home third behind the colts Bayardo and Perdiccas in the New Stakes. In the following month she took the Exeter Stakes at Newmarket from two \\"moderate\\" opponents and the Rous Memorial at Goodwood Racecourse, beating the Ludwig Neumann's filly Electra \\"with any amount in hand\\" in the latter race. She recorded a fourth success in August whe she won the Hardwicke Stakes at Stockton Racecourse. In the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 October she finished second to Bayardo who by then had established himself as the year's leading juvenile colt. On her only other start of the year she started favourite for the Cheveley Park Stakes but finished unplaced behind the Sceptre filly (later named Maid of the Mist). Her earnings for the season totalled £3,253. 1909: three-year-old season Frank Wootton, who rode Perola to victory in the Oaks On 30 April 1909 Perola was one of ten fillies to contest the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket, despite being reported to be \\"somewhat amiss\\" before the race. Ridden by the Australian teenager Frank Wootton, she started the 3/1 second favourite and finished third behind Electra and King Edward VII's Princesse de Galles. Her temperament may have contributed to her defeat: she was described as being in a \\"fightable\\" mood on the way to the start and repeatedly veered off a straight course during the race. Perola was then moved in distance for the 131st running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom on 28 May, with Wootton again in the saddle. The first three from the 1000 Guineas dominated the betting, with Electra starting the 5/4 favourite ahead of Perola (5/1) and Princesse de Galles (11/2). Electra lost her chance at the start as she whipped round and was facing in the wrong direction when the tapes went up. After taking the lead in the straight, Perola never looked in any danger of defeat in the last quarter mile and won \\"with a good deal in hand\\" by two lengths from Princesse de Galles with a further two lengths back to the outsider Verne in third place. Her winning time of 2:39.8 was 2.6 seconds faster than that recorded by Minoru in the Derby Stakes over the same course and distance two days previously. At Hurst Park in August, Perola finished last of the three runners behind the colts Bayardo and Valens in the Duchess of York Plate. Perola earned a total of £4,960 in 1909. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Perola an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. ==Breeding record== In early 1910 Perola was sold privately to a French breeder. William Cooper explained that he did not have the space to create a breeding facility on his own property and did not want to put his mares to stud at a location where he could not see them regularly. The buyer was Edouard de Rothschild, who moved the mare to his Meautry stud near Deauville in Normandy. She produced at least five foals between 1912 and 1923: *Le Paraclet, bay colt, foaled in 1912, sired by Sans Souci *Plantagenet, chestnut colt, 1913, by Sans Souci *Pindare, bay colt, 1914, by Sans Souci *Passebreul, chestnut colt, 1915, by Predicateur.

Hartong was a pioneer of the Dutch Latin jazz scene, he was also a musicologist and author. == Biography ==  Youth  Hartong was born on the 5th of November 1941 in Amersfoort. With his father he went to concerts by Duke Ellington, Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner. His aunt Corrie Hartong knew the mother of Pim Jacobs and arranged that Hartong got piano lessons from him.Yearbook 2017, City Archives Rotterdam Led by Pim Jacobs, he discovered the secrets of Modern Jazz. His idols were Wynton Kelly, Les McCann and Ahmad Jamal. Jazz Bulletin, June 2016 In his youth he first came into contact with Latin American music. \\"I was about twelve years old, I played quite a bit of piano and loved bebop. One day my brother came with a Cuban lp by Cal Tjader. When I heard that, I was sold.\\"Between rumba and rondo, Man and Melody, February 1998 As a 16-year-old, he founded a jazz trio with Ruud Jacobs on bass and Cees See, later Han Bennink on drums. They performed a lot, including in the jazz cellar Persepolis in Utrecht and De Benelux in Hilversum. After his high school, Hartong opted for a career in music.  1960–1969  From 1962 to 1964 Hartong studied classical piano at the conservatory in Utrecht, where he was taught by Sas Bunge. Hartong then left for Salzburg to continue his classical piano studies at the Mozarteum Academy, where he graduated in 1967.Jazz Nu, March 1994 In Salzburg he met his wife, the Egyptian-Swiss opera singer Diana Zaki, with whom he gave classical recitals together. In 1966 Hartong participated in the International Competition for Modern jazz in Vienna and came through to the final with Loek Dikker, Fritz Pauer, Joachim Kühn and the final winner Jan Hammer. He received a medal from Cannonball Adderley for this achievement.Latin Beat Magazine, June/July 1995  1970–1979  In 1974, Hartong began studying musicology at the universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam. With his graduation, he became the first doctoral candidate in ethnomusicology in the Netherlands. From 1975 to 1980, Hartong was attached to the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam as deputy curator of the Music Department. Hartong organized, together with Edy Martinez and Tito Puente, concerts and workshops for the Tropical Institute.  1980–1989  In 1980, Rob Madna asked Hartong to put Latin jazz on the Rotterdam Conservatoire agenda. A year later Frans Elsen asked him for the Royal Conservatory in The Hague and Eri Youssouf approached him for the jazz academy in Hilversum. In 1982 Hartong founded the band Manteca with a typical salsa repertoire with which they performed at parties in Dutch and German clubs. In 1984 and 1987 Hartong went to Cuba to study local music there. After his second visit to Cuba he decided to radically change direction. The name of the band was changed to Nueva Manteca and it became an instrumental Latin jazz band. Hartong: \\"It is my goal to make full concert music. Nueva Manteca must be an experimental band. We no longer play covers, but only our own compositions and arrangements. We are looking for a mix of jazz and Latin.  1990–1999  In 1990, together with the musicologist Joep Bor, Hartong founded the World Music department of the Rotterdam Conservatory (CODARTS). Until his death Hartong stayed connected to this training. With Nueva Manteca, Hartong released three studio albums in the early 90s: Afrodisia with, among others, the Alborada composed by Hartong in 1991, which received good reviews and set the band at the forefront of Europeans Afro-Cuban jazz bands.The Jazz Review, November 1991 Bluesongo with, among others, the Bluesongo composed by Hartong in 1994. In the same year their instrumental Latin-jazz version of Porgy & Bess also came out. His composition Something in Blue ended up on the studio album of the Double Dutch band from 1994. In 1994 Hartong played with Nueva Manteca at the KLM Jazz Festival in Curaçao, Euro Jazz Night, the International Music Festival in Leeds Yorkshire Post, May 11 1994 and for the first time at the North Sea Jazz Festival, where the band performed 4 times over the years. In 1994 Hartong played with Nueva Manteca in Nick Vollebregt's Jazz Café in Laren. A recording was made of this concert, which was released on CD under the title Live At Nick Vollebregt's Jazz Cafe. The American record boss Bruce Lundval heard the band play in the Netherlands and decided to release the album Let's Face The Music And Dance with Nueva Manteca. Hartong's arrangement of Miles Davis's composition All Blues stood high on the charts of several Latin-Radio DJs in the United States for months. Max Salazar considers the song one of the all-time outstanding Latin jazz recordings. Latin Beat Magazine called it a great CD and by far the best effort to date from Europe's #1 Latin jazz ensemble.Latin Beat Magazine, October 1996 In 1997 the world premiere of Hartong's religious composition Afro Cuban Sanctus took place during the Musica Sacra Festival in Maastricht.Algemeen Dagblad, 17 September 1997 In 1998 the band released the studio album Nightpeople with, among other things, the Nightpeople composed by Hartong.  2000–2010  With Nueva Manteca, in 2002, Hartong released the studio album Congo Square: Tribute to New Orleans and in 2003 Latin tribute to West Side Story In 2005 he started the jazz trio Alliance with Peter Ypma (drums) and Marius Beets (bass). They released the album Trio Alliance – Standards Straight Ahead, with live recordings and new studio recordings. In 2006 he published his book Musical Terms Worldwide, in which musical terms and essays on Western and non-Western musical traditions can be found.  2011–2016  In 2011, a second religious composition by Hartong, Requiem para el Mundo, was performed in Israel on his seventieth birthday with the Israeli vocal group The Vocal Octet. In 2013, Hartong released the live album Live 25 Years – Nueva Manteca with Nueva Manteca. As a result, Hartong wrote the following: \\"The primary mission of Nueva Manteca is to further develop and strengthen its own artistic signature, to break through conventions, and to continue to make a substantial contribution to the development of the Latin jazz idiom worldwide and in the Netherlands in particular. Since its founding in 1987, exactly 25 years ago, Nueva Manteca has been distinctive from the outset and has become an internationally acclaimed institution with a clear position in talent development. Young talents regularly get opportunities from the band to gain practical experience at home and abroad.\\"Diana Hartong’s archive In 2015, Hartong and Nueva Manteca release the latest live album Crime!, including Ciao City composed by Hartong. == Discography ==  Albums with Nueva Manteca  * Varadero Blues (1989) * Afrodisia (1991) * Bluesongo (1994) * Porgy & Bess (1994) * Live At Nick Vollebregt's Jazz Cafe (1994) * Let's Face The Music And Dance (1996) * Afro Cuban Sanctus (1997) * Nightpeople (1998) * Congo Square: Tribute to New Orleans (2002) * Latin tribute to West Side Story (2003) * Live 25 Years – Nueva Manteca (2013) * Crime!

The genus was created in 2017 by Amin & Heckmann for the single species Neoandracantha peruensis. The genus was differentiated from the closely related genus Andracantha Schmidt, 1975 because members of Andracantha have anteriorly enlarged pear-shaped Corynosoma-like trunks, only two fields of anterior trunk spines with occasional genital spines, and bilateral or tandem testes, and because proboscides of species of Andracantha have considerably fewer hooks that gradually decrease in size posteriorly. Neoandracantha peruensis is an endoparasite in the Polymorphidae family of thorny-headed worms. The larval stages (cystacanths) of Neoandracantha peruensis were described from the ghost crab Ocypode gaudichaudii collected from the Pacific coast of Peru. While it is uncommon to describe acanthocephalan taxa from immature stages, Amin & Heckmann (2017) claimed that the presence of clear-cut distinguishing features separating the present material from its nearest congeneric taxa, and the absence of adults, justified the erection of the new species N. peruensis. ==Morphology== Specimens of N. peruensis have a slender trunk with two anterior swellings, 3 separate fields of spines on the foretrunk swelling, and no genital spines on the hindtrunk.

The songs are largely pop or R&B; but feature a more diverse array of genres.

In 2014 HyunA's new song \\"From When and Until When\\" (어디부터 어디까지), which she co-wrote with labelmate Hyunsik of BtoB, attracted attention and some controversy when listeners realized that several lines were exactly the same as the lyrics of the song \\"The Reason Why Opposites Attract\\" (반대가 끌리는 이유). HyunA and Hyunsik later admitted that they had intentionally incorporated the lyrics as a fan homage to g.o.d's 15th anniversary reunion that year and apologized for failing to inform songwriter Park Jin-young and the g.o.d members. ==Reception== \\"An Ordinary Day\\" and \\"The Reason Why Opposites Attract\\" won first place on the music programs Inkigayo and Music Camp (the former incarnation of Show!

A mysterious traveller (played by Jayaram Karthik) visits their home on the same day and requests to be allowed to stay overnight. What happens during that one intense night forms rest of the story. The movie starts with a view of a burning house in a village and the narrator narrates that this is the end of the story not the beginning. The scene shifts to a God man preaching about human desires to the villagers and how it is common for all living beings to have desires. He advises, as humans one should be in control of their desires though it is natural for all to have desires. Among the God man's audience, are villagers Gowramma and her daughter Mallika, who questions the God man's preaching to her mother's annoyance. They decide to leave the session midway as Mallika's taunts were annoying the mother and also since it was getting late. Farmer Onti Maney Muthanna, his wife Gowramma and daughter Mallika(Malli), all live in a remote village where the closest neighbor is 3 miles away. They had pawned 9 acres of their agricultural land to a loan shark when unforeseen medical expenses befell the family and were since living in poverty. Farmer Muthanna is an alcoholic who drinks every other night, Gowramma works in the farm and also helps as a midwife to village women, expertly delivering their children, the daughter Mallika is an ambitious woman who rues of her misfortunes, constantly craving to marry and start a family of her own. She is frustrated and keeps taunting her mother about this. One day a wandering fortune teller visits their house and predicts that they are about to see a lot of money, however warns them that they should look beyond the money. But the family drives him away and as he walks away from the house, a tourist visits the house asking for some water to drink. The tourist introduces himself as Chenna Keshava a traveler and writer. He seeks permission to stay the night over at Muthanna's house as the next village was very far and would take him over a day to reach there. The family reluctantly agrees since there is an unmarried girl in the house and may lead villagers to talk ill about them if they got to know a stranger stayed overnight. The tourist is very polite and generous towards the family; offers money to buy tea dust when Muthanna expresses a desire to drink tea, while paying a little extra for Muthanna's troubles. The loan shark, to whom the land and house is pawned, visits Muthanna's house one day and demands Muthanna to pay more attention to the farm and its produce as the land is now his and he needs to reap profit from it. When there, the loan shark also hints that if people accepted his ideas, things could get better; alluding his interest in Mallika. Muthanna and Gowramma are furious at this but are silent; however Mallika expresses her disgust indicating she is not interested in him. Meanwhile, the tourist, Chenna Keshava overhears all of this and offers to help the family. He shows the family some cash and jewels while subtly pointing that he can pay off the loan shark if they would allow him to. The family is surprised but they refuse to accept his offer since he is a stranger. In the evening, the tourist requests for some chicken curry to be prepared and again offer money for the necessary ingredients and again a little extra so that the entire family can enjoy a good meal. The cash and jewelry sows seeds of greed in Mallika and secretly wishes to keep all the jewels for herself. Blinded by this greed, she convinces her mother and father to kill the tourist and rob him of his money. While Muthanna goes to the local arrack shop, Gowramma and Mallika prepare the chicken curry and decide to poison it. Just before dinner, two policemen arrive at their house enquiring if they have seen any stranger around since there was a robbery nearby. Both women deny seeing anybody. The policemen smell aroma of the chicken curry and request themselves to be invited for a meal. Gowramma topples the plate with poisoned meal and brings the policemen new plates, thus avoids poisoning the policemen. The policemen leave after a good meal praising Gowramma of her culinary skills. Sadly, the pet dog eats the toppled food and dies of poisoning. Later, the tourist finishes his meal and goes to sleep a happy man. Mallika realizes that her mother did not lace the new plate with poison after the policemen left their house. Frustrated, Mallika decides to kill the tourist herself. She slits his throat while he is asleep and goes out to dig him a grave. Muthanna, meanwhile at the local arrack shop discovers from the waiter at the bar that many people there know about the visitor at his house. He runs home only to discover that the women have already killed the tourist. He weeps his heart out upon this discovery and reveals the true identity of the traveler, which he learnt from the waiter at the local arrack shop. The tourist had visited the arrack shop before going to Muthanna's house and had revealed his identity to the people at the arrack shop. The tourist was the son of Muthanna who had run away a long time ago in fear of his mother's beating. ==Production== Development The movie is based on a Kannada play by Mohan Habbu which was based on the Russian story titled The Return of the Soldier. Senior director S. K. Bhagavan had revealed that during the making of 1978 Kannada movie Shankar Guru, he had narrated this story to matinee idol Rajkumar.The film was planned to be shot in Ladakh and some preparation was undertaken, but in the end Rajkumar backed out as he felt the story was too dark. Impressed by Mohan Habbu's story, Dayal decided to acquire the rights and make it into a full-length feature film.

Once out of Big Boss Dayal sprung into action and completed the entire script, along with co- dialogue writer Naveen Krishna, and narrated the full script to JK and Anupama once they were out of the Big Boss game. ==Casting== Once the lead pair was fixed, Dayal zeroed in on Rangayana Raghu and Veena Sundar for other pivotal roles. Many of Dayal's contestant friends from Bigg Boss like Jaya Srinivasan, Ashitha and Diwakar are making character appearances in the movie. This film will be Jayaram Karthik's first release since his Bigg Boss stint as a lead and is going to be the second movie as a leading lady for popular tele-actress Anupama Gowda. Experienced Cinematographer P.K.H. Das is helming the camera. Sri (CrazyMindz) is the movie's editor. Ganesh Narayan is composing the music for the film. Filming The muhurat for the movie is happened on 19 February in Oni Anjaneyaswamy Temple, Bangalore. Simultaneously Dayal's other movie PUTA 109, again starring Jayaram Karthik, is also being launched on the same day. The movie's shoot is to take place over 25 days in Balur, Chikmagalur Taluk. ==Reception== The movie got 4/5 stars in TOI reviews. The Bangalore mirror rated the movie as one of the best movies of the year. Kannada Actor Sudeep said the movie was \\"gripping\\". The movie has an 80% rating on BookMyShow. TheNewsMinute mentions that \\"seasoned\\" actors and \\"clever\\" director came together hand-in-hand to make an interesting suspense thriller flick. Shyam Prasad S from Bangalore mirror said the movie is one of the best movies of the year and credited the convincing performances and brilliant technical execution for the success.

Formed in 1916 as the Section technique de l'aéronautique the STAé continued until 1980 when its functions were distributed among other French governmental bodies, including the Service technique des programmes aéronautiques (STPA), Service technique des télécommunications et des équipements aéronautiques (STPA) and the Service central de la production, des prix et de la maintenance (SCPM). ==History== In 1877 l'Établissement central de l'aérostation militaire de Chalais-Meudon (Central Establishment of the air balloon of Chalais- Meudon) was formed as the first aeronautical laboratory in the world, with a mission to design and assemble all French military aero-static equipment, from components made in industry, and train personnel in their use. At the beginning of 1916 French military aircraft were being surpassed in performance and armament. The lack of technical coordination lead to disagreements between the views and desires of command and the capabilities of manufacturers , resulting in development delays and technological dead ends. At the instigation of the Deputy Secretary of State for Aeronautics René Besnard and Minister of War General Gallieni, the Section technique de l'aéronautique was created on 21 February 1916, to coordinate all aspects of the design of new aircraft, lead by Émile Dorand former head of Laboratoire d'aéronautique de Chalais-Meudon, ( the contemporary French equivalent of the British Royal Aircraft Factory). The STAé moved to Issy-les-Moulineaux, creating the l’Établissement d’expériences techniques d’Issy-les-Moulineaux (Issy-les- Moulineaux Technical Experiments Establishment), which included laboratories, wind tunnels and ground testing facilities, placed at the disposal of the Ministère de la Guerre (Ministry of War). the new establishment was charged with directing, coordinating and centralising new research and experiments concerning military aviation, in three categories: aviation, armament and R&D; (research and development). Dorand led the STAé in development of a \\"standard atmosphere\\" in order to be able to compare the performance of different aircraft and equipment using a common baseline. The STAé was also charged with ensuring that the demands of service chiefs were met, where possible by French industry, correlating the demands of the military with the material possibilities of the moment; determine the performance of equipment presented by manufacturers to improve knowledge of the laws of aeronautics. The first tasks of the STAé were: to develop a tractor propeller observation aircraft to allow defence against the Fokker E.III attacking from behind; to introduce a fighter able to fire through the propeller disk and develop twin-engined three-seat observation aircraft. Latterly the STAé turned its attention to aircraft engines issuing specifications and pushing for lighter, more powerful and reliable engines. On 6 April 1918, a ministerial decision officially made the STAé responsible for aircraft, engines, armament, flight test and research. The STAé wind tunnel under construction at Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1921 On 6 June 1919, l'Office de coordination générale de l'aéronautique was created and attached to the direction de l'aéronautique militaire, bringing together the STAé, Service des fabrications de l'aéronautique (SFA) and Service de la navigation aérienne (SNAé). The STAé established regulations for designing aircraft to improve safety, as well as drawing up specifications for a wide range of military aircraft classes, which were assessed in a competitive fashion and production contracts issued accordingly. In 1934, under the ministère du général Victor Denain, the Direction générale de l’aéronautique was replaced by the Direction des constructions aériennes, in which the STAé and the SPAé were incorporateded . Until 1939-1940, the STAé standardised equipment and products for civil and military aviation under the specific regulations of the Ministry of Air, developing and approving standards in consultation with industry and their implementation. After the surrender of France in May 1940, the STAé evacuated to Roanne in Vichy France. In 1945, Inspector General Merle, director of the STAé created an Etudes Special section (STAé/ES) for research and development of missiles; other sections that emerged over the years included Etudes Special sections for helicopters, equipment, engines, armament and more... ==STAé specifications== From 1919 the STAé drew up specifications for specific roles in military aviation and assessed designs from industry competitively before production contracts were issued. ==Directors== ;Émile Dorand:February 28, 1916 - January 11, 1918 ;Albert Caquot:January 12, 1918 - 1920 ;Georges Fortrant:1920 - 1925 ;Albert Caquot:1928 - 1933 ... ;Roger Guénod:1974 - 1980 ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Aeronautics during the World War , Paris, Maurice de Brunoff,1919 *The Evolution of French Aircraft During the War, by Colonel Dorand, p. 111-118 *Committee for the History of Aeronautics , A half-century of aeronautics in France: introductory work , Department of Armament History, Center for Advanced Studies of Armament,2003 *Committee for the History of Aeronautics , A half-century of aeronautics in France: The equipment , vol. 2, Department of Armament History of the Center for Advanced Studies of Armament ,2004 *DGAC Historical Archives , Civil Aviation Directorate,2009 [PDF] *Louis Bonte , The History of flight tests , Paris, Editions Larivière , coll. \\" Docavia \\" ( n o 3)1975 *Patrick Facon , \\" The Mechanization of War: The rear, factories and schools ,\\" The Fana Aviation , n o HS 48,April 2012, p. 100 ( ISSN 0757-4169 ) *BNAE - Activity Report 2010, p.2 [PDF], Bureau of Aeronautics and Space Standards,2010 *Marie-Catherine Dubreil-Villatoux, [PDF] Archives of the military aeronautics of the First World War, Historical Service of the Defense, 2008 (accessed February 15, 2015 ) p.32. *Albert Étévé , Victory rosettes , Robert Laffont, 1970 *City of Meudon - From Kite to Aviation: Aviation, http://www.carnetdevol.org *Marie-Catherine Dubreil- Villatoux, Archives of military aircraft of the First World War , [PDF], Defense Historical Service,2008 (accessed February 15, 2015 ) p. 36 *The Legislative Bulletin Dalloz: laws, decrees, orders, circulars, etc. , Paris, Dalloz ,1919, p.p.428-429 *General Directorate of Armament, Tactical missiles from 1945 to 2000 *Jean-Marie Potelle, The History of Djinn, Helico-passion *Archives of the Military Aeronautics of the First World War, [PDF], Historical Defense Service,2008 (accessed February 15, 2015 ) p. 44 *General Officers, webgenealogies.com (accessed February 13, 2015 ) *Georges Bousquet and Gabriel Colin, Roger Guenod (43) A life marked by passion flight test , the Yellow and the Red Category:Aviation organizations based in France ","title":"Service Technique de l'Aéronautique"},{"id":"56557580","text":"Sadie Chandler Cole, from a 1919 publication.

At the National Archaeological Museum in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, she shares responsibility for the protohistoric collections. In 1987, she helped to organise the exhibition ('Treasures of the Celtic Princes'). She is the author of several books on European protohistory and the Celts.

In the 4th century BC, the Celtic \\"koine\\" spread over the whole of Europe, from the Balkans to the British Isles. There was no political unity, but a community of culture, which was expressed both by the exuberance of the art of metalworking and the same funeral rites. Christiane Éluère traces a history of more than half a millennium of these \\"barbarians\\" of the West—who were the lovers of gold, wine and war, whom the Roman Empire tried to subjugate, reducing their frontiers to Gaul, and the survival of their culture to the island peoples, reborn in the art of Celtic Christianity—in this small but richly illustrated volume— (lit. 'Europe of the Celts'; UK edition – The Celts: First Masters of Europe; US edition – The Celts: Conquerors of Ancient Europe)—published by Éditions Gallimard as the 158th volume in their series for the \\"Découvertes\\" collection.

The body text is divided into six chapters: I, \\"Birth of a Warrior Aristocracy\\" (); II, \\"The First Celtic Princes\\" (); III, \\"The All-Conquering Celts\\" (); IV, \\"The Celts Against the Might of Rome\\" (); V, \\"Realms of Religion\\" (); VI, \\"Celtic Memories\\" ().

(); 6, The druids (); 7, Celtic gold (); 8, Celtic art (English edition exclusive); 9, The first British heroine (English edition exclusive). At the end of the book are further reading, list of illustrations and index. The book presents a comprehensive idea of the Celts' lifestyle.

He had an affair with Seymour Worsley during her marriage to Richard, and they had a child together (Jane Seymour Worsley), whom Richard claimed to be his own to avoid scandal. == Life == Maurice George Bisset was born in 1757 to Rev. Alexander Bisset. He was a captain in the South Hampshire militia. Bisset had been Worsley's close friend and neighbour at Knighton Gorges on the Isle of Wight. He fathered a child by Seymour in August 1781, and in November 1781 they ran away together so Seymour could escape her failing marriage with Richard. However, they were discovered. In February 1782, Worsley brought a criminal conversation case for £20,000 (2015: £) against Bisset. Seymour was rumoured to have 27 lovers, and turned the case against Richard as it was made obvious that he consented and even encouraged the relationship between Bisset and Seymour. This testimony destroyed Worsley's suit and the jury awarded him only one shilling (2015: £) in damages. However, Seymour could not get a divorce from Richard, only a separation, meaning she could not remarry until he died. Because of this, Bisset eventually left Seymour, and went on to marry Harriat Mordaunt in 1787. They had at least two children together, including a daughter named Jane Harriot Fenwick. He died in 1821, aged around 64. ==In popular culture== Welsh actor Aneurin Barnard played Bisset in the 2015 BBC2 television film The Scandalous Lady W, based upon Hallie Rubenhold's book Lady Worsley's Whim. ==References== * * * Category:1757 births Category:1821 deaths Category:Sex scandals Category:Adultery in law ","title":"Maurice George Bisset"},{"id":"56557756","text":"Đurica Župarić (born 22 September 1984 in Croatia) is a Croatian former footballer who is last known to have played for Segesta Sisak in his home country. ==Career== NK Marsonia 1909 Due to NK Marsonia 1909 not paying for his apartment, Župarić was bereft of a home for some time, staying on the streets.

Bruce Mansfield began commercial operations of Unit 1 in 1976 with Units 2 and 3 following suit in 1977 and 1980 respectively.

PJM Interconnection conducted an analysis and concluded the plant's closure would not affect grid reliability. The closure was moved back to November 2019 due to, \\"a lack of economic viability.\\" ==Environmental mitigation== Units 1 and 2 were installed with a flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) system to prevent sulfur dioxide () from being emitted into the atmosphere. Its chimney is tall. The sludge was then transported by pipe to Little Blue Run Lake between Beaver County, Pennsylvania and Hancock County, West Virginia. When Unit 3 was constructed in 1980, an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) system, designed by the Weir Group, was installed instead for the unit to curb particulate emissions. Its chimney is tall. To reduce waste disposal from scrubbers at Bruce Mansfield, National Gypsum constructed a nearby plant in 1998 to process synthetic gypsum from the plant to produce drywall. To deliver the gypsum for the nearby manufacturer, a forced-oxidation gypsum (FOG) system was built. A $200 million dewatering facility was completed in 2016 in response to a 2012 settlement that prohibits the further disposal of byproduct at Little Blue Run Lake. The facility would separate byproduct from water and then be properly disposed of in a lined impoundment at Murray Energy's mine in Marshall County, West Virginia. The dewatering facility began operations in January 2017, but problems at the new facility forced the plant to go offline the following month. The plant restarted two weeks later. ==Incidents== A release of hydrogen sulfide () during repair work on a pipe killed two and injured four workers in August 2017. The workers' families who experienced casualties in the accident filed lawsuits against FirstEnergy in November 2017 seeking damages. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined FirstEnergy $77,605 for workplace hazards and also fined subcontractor Enerfab $129,340 for failing to provide “appropriate respiratory protection”. FirstEnergy ultimately settled by paying a fine of $65,963. On January 10, 2018, Bruce Mansfield caught on fire causing damage to its roof and duct work. In a filing later that month, FirstEnergy revealed that the fire caused significant damage to the equipment for Units 1 and 2. The damage was severe enough that deactivation of both units were accelerated from June 2021 to February 5, 2019. ==See also== * List of largest power stations in the United States * List of power stations in Pennsylvania ==References * Bruce Mansfield Plant - First Energy Generation Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1976 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1977 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1980 Category:FirstEnergy Category:Former coal-fired power stations in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Beaver County, Pennsylvania Category:1976 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:2019 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Bruce Mansfield Power Plant"},{"id":"56558061","text":"Peter Hynes may refer to: * Peter Hynes (footballer) (born 1983), Irish footballer * Peter Hynes (rugby union) (born 1982), Australian rugby union player ","title":"Peter Hynes"},{"id":"56558134","text":"Dmitry Fuchs (right) with Sergei Tabachnikov, at Oberwolfach in 2006 Dmitry Borisovich Fuchs (Дмитрий Борисович Фукс, born 30 September 1939, Kazan,Comprehensive Biographical Encyclopedia Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) is a Russian-American mathematician, specializing in the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups and in topology.Dmitry B. Fuchs, Mathematics, University of California, Davis ==Education and career== Fuchs received in 1964 his Russian candidate degree (Ph.D.) under Albert S. Schwarz at Moscow State University, where he taught thereafter. Schwarz conducted a seminar on algebraic topology with Mikhail Postnikov and Vladimir Boltyanski. Fuchs participated in the seminar and, as a student, published papers with Schwarz, as did Askold Ivanovich Vinogradov a few years earlier. Fuchs received his Russian doctorate (higher doctoral degree) in 1987 at Tbilisi State University. Since 1991 he has been a professor at the University of California, Davis. With Israel Gelfand he introduced in 1970 the Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology of Lie algebras.Israel M. Gel'fand, Dmitry B.

Fuks: Cohomology of the Lie algebra of formal vector fields. In: Mathematics of the USSR. Izvestija. vol. 4, no. 2, 1970, pp. 327–340, . Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology has applications in the proof of the Macdonald identities in combinatorics and in the calculation of characteristic classes of foliations. With Boris Feigin he determined the structure of Verma modules in the Virasoro algebra representation theory, which has applications in string theory and conformal field theory.with Fedor G.

He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, and matriculated at St. John's College, Oxford, 30 June 1768, and was a fellow from 1768 to 1771, but never took a degree. India In 1772, to avoid entering the church, and without the knowledge of his father, he enlisted for service with the East India Company under the assumed name of John Rover. He travelled to India on the East Indiaman, the Duke of Grafton.H.S. King and Company, History of the Organization, Equipment, and War Services of the Regiment of Bengal Artillery, Volume 2, 1877, p.60 He spent his first six years in India in the ranks of the Bengal Artillery, until he caught the attention of its commander Colonel Pearse. It is recorded that one day Horsford pointed out an error in a Greek quotation in some papers he was copying for Pearse. It is said that Pearse suddenly called him by his right name as he was leaving the room and subsequently an order, dated Fort William, 9 March 1778, addressed to ‘Captain Watkin Thelwall, commanding No. 1 company, notifies that Sergeant John Rover, of the company under your command, is this day appointed a cadet of artillery in the Bengal Army under the name of \\"John Horsford.\\"’ He was made a lieutenant-fireworker on 31 March 1778, and a first lieutenant in October that same year. In 1786 he was promoted to captain. During the Third Anglo-Mysore War he commanded a company of Bengal artillery detached to Madras. He served at the Siege of Bangalore, Battle of Arakere, and Siege of Seringapatam. In March 1801, at Cawnpore, Horsford addressed a paper to Lord Lake setting forth the defects in organisation of the artillery branch and that same year was advanced to Major. He commanded the artillery under Lord Lake during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803–5, including the battles of Siege of Aligarh and Delhi, siege of Agra, sieges Deeg and Bhurtpore. In 1804 he was made Lieutenant-Colonel. He commanded a brigade and also directed the artillery at the siege of Komanur, August–November 1807. On the resignation of Colonel Nicholas Carnegie in 1808 Horsford succeeded to the command of the Bengal artillery, of which he remained virtually the head until his death. Horsford became a full Colonel in July 1810. In June 1811 he was promoted to Major-General. He was not engaged in the Anglo-Nepalese War but the artillery arrangements for those operations and for the grand army during the Third Anglo-Maratha War were directed by him. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 7 April 1815, and 28 June 1816 was appointed an extra major-general on the staff of the grand army. In June 1816 he addressed a memorial to the Marquis of Hastings, which showed that the lessons taught by the great continental wars in Europe had not escaped him. His high reputation secured attention to his representations, and although he did not live to see the results, the reorganisation of the Bengal artillery that followed in 1817–18 added largely to the efficiency of that famous corps. His last military operation was the direction of the artillery at the siege of Hathras in March 1817. Death He died at Cawnpore of heart disease, on 20 April, just ten days after his return from Hathras. He was sixty six at the time of his death and had served in the military for forty five years, during which it is said he never had a day's leave from his duties. He was buried at the Christian cemetery in Cawnpore. ==Personal life== Whilst in India, Horsford entered into a long term relationship with an Indian women called Sahib Juan, with whom he had several children. His anxiety towards his daughters led him to condemn discrimination against \\"Eurasians\\" or \\"East Indians\\" as mixed race individuals were referred to at the time. He published a number of poems defending such inter-racial relationships. He also lent support to James Kirkpatrick's Bengal Orphan Institute, and in a poem called the \\"Art of Living in India\\" he praised the biracial \\"auburn beauties\\" in the Howrah orphanage and encouraged young British men in India to marry them.Mary Ellis Gibson, Anglophone Poetry in Colonial India, 1780-1913: A Critical Anthology, Ohio University Press, 2011, p.45 ==Legacy== A historian of the Bengal artillery wrote of him: Along with Litellus Burrell, Horsford was a rare example of a man rising from the ranks to a high military position in the East India Company's army. ==References== ;Attribution Category:1751 births Category:1817 deaths Category:People educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood Category:British East India Company Army officers Category:British military personnel of the Third Anglo- Mysore War Category:British military personnel of the Second Anglo-Maratha War Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:People of British India ","title":"John Horsford"},{"id":"56558338","text":"Otterpool Quarry is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Hythe in Kent.

The Bonar Law College had been opened in 1929 by Stanley Baldwin having been presented to the Conservative Party by Mr Urban Broughton as a training college for Conservative workers. It was named as a memorial to Bonar Law, the British Conservative Party politician and Prime Minister, who had died in 1923. The aim of the College was to provide political education and was not explicitly Conservative. Associated with the College were regional or county circles or clubs; their activities were reported by The Ashridge Journal. Ordinary membership was open to those who had attended courses at Ashridge, with others being associate members. Membership was by subscription.Rules of the Ashridge Dining Club Meetings took place at York Mansions Restaurant, Petty France, London.

Consisting of a gold half eagle ($5 coin), two different sizes of silver dollars, and a copper-nickel clad half dollar, each of the four was issued in proof condition, with all but the larger silver dollar also issued in uncirculated. The gold coins were struck at the West Point Mint, the silver at the Philadelphia Mint and the base metal half dollars at the mints in Denver and San Francisco. All four coins have the same design. The obverse depicts a bootprint on the lunar surface, based on a photograph taken by Aldrin. That design is by Maine sculptor Gary Cooper, with engraving by Joseph Menna of the Mint. The reverse, as mandated by Congress, depicts the visor and surrounding helmet of Aldrin's space suit, with Armstrong, the U.S. flag and the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle in the reflection. This is based on a well-known photograph taken by Armstrong, and was created and engraved by Phebe Hemphill of the Mint. The depiction of Aldrin made him the seventh individual to appear on a U.S. coin who was alive at the time the coins were struck. The Apollo 11 coins are curved, so that the obverse is concave and the reverse is convex. Prior to the release date of January 24, 2019, there was anticipation that some denominations might sell out, as had occurred with the previous U.S. issue of curved pieces, the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coins. This did not prove to be the case, and none of the coins sold out before sales ended on December 27, 2019. It was nevertheless the most successful US commemorative coin program since the Baseball Hall of Fame issue, with over 600,000 Apollo 11 coins sold. == Background == Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, as photographed by Neil Armstrong, who is visible in the reflection on the visor In 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy challenged his nation to land an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth. The U.S. space agency, NASA, worked towards this goal incrementally, sending astronauts into space during Project Mercury and Project Gemini, leading up to the Apollo program. NASA achieved its goal with Apollo 11, which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited the Moon. The mission returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, fulfilling Kennedy's challenge. About an hour and a half after Armstrong first set foot on the lunar surface, Aldrin performed the Boot Print Soil Mechanics Experiment. He photographed an undisturbed area of the surface, then made two bootprints and photographed them. Those two bootprints were not disturbed by the astronauts' subsequent activity, and are visible in photographs taken from the Lunar Module Eagle prior to liftoff. About 13 minutes following the taking of the bootprint photographs, after Armstrong had collected a bulk sample of lunar regolith from the surface, Aldrin was supposed to photograph the site the material had been taken from. Instead, he offered the camera to Armstrong, perhaps feeling that as Armstrong had taken the sample, he could make better use of the camera. Armstrong took eight photographs before Aldrin resumed use of the camera; the eighth has been deemed \\"one of the most famous photos in history: a portrait of Aldrin, his gold-plated sun visor reflecting the photographer and the Lunar Module, the flag, and the moon’s horizon against an unimaginably black sky.\\" ==Proposal and legislation == The Apollo 11 coins were the brainchild of Mike Olson, a member of the federal Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) from Iowa, who thought of it in February 2014, several months before his term on the committee ended. He had recently rewatched the film Apollo 13, and felt there should be a coin issue in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of Apollo 11 landing on the Moon. The CCAC was preparing its annual report and he persuaded his colleagues to include a recommendation for Apollo 11 coinage. Olson had left the committee by the time the CCAC prepared its annual report, but the chair, Gary Marks, took up the cause and got it included. In January 2015, Olson discussed his proposal with Iowa Representative Rod Blum, who referred the matter to Florida's Bill Posey, whose district included the Kennedy Space Center, and who as a young man had worked in the Apollo program. Posey obtained a bipartisan group of cosponsors and introduced legislation in June 2015. Legislation to mark the 25th anniversary of the Moon landing with coins had been introduced into Congress in 1993 but had failed, as had a bill in 2007 for the 50th anniversary of NASA. The Mint had three times previously honored the Moon landings on coins, with the reverses fo the Eisenhower dollar (1971) and Susan B. Anthony dollar (1979), both showing the Apollo 11 mission patch), and with the 2002 Ohio entry in the State Quarters series, depicting an Apollo astronaut. The 2015 bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services, where it sat; the website GovTrack.us gave it a 13 percent chance of enactment. Through 2016, advocates attempted to boost support for the bill, which by November had 298 cosponsors, enough to get a floor vote during the lame-duck session of Congress. Olson continued his lobbying, as did the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, each designated to receive some of the surcharges on the coins. Despite the support of Aldrin and Collins, the surviving Apollo 11 astronauts, the Senate version of the bill had only 11 cosponsors, far fewer than the 67 needed for a vote. If there was no successful vote, the bill would die at the end of the 114th Congress. House proceedings for HR 2726 On December 5, the last day of the House session, the bill was called up for debate by Congressman Posey, who then addressed the House in support of the bill, recounting the history of Apollo 11. Nydia M. Velázquez of New York and Frederica S. Wilson of Florida spoke of the hundreds of thousands of workers who had made Apollo possible, and applauded the inclusion of the Scholarship Foundation as a beneficiary, hoping the coins would have a legacy of young people entering the sciences. Posey spoke again briefly, and the bill passed without opposition. A final push by proponents resulted in 70 Senate cosponsors, three more than needed. Arkansas Senator John Boozman brought the bill to the Senate floor on December 9, and it passed without opposition. The bill became Public Law 114–282 with the signature of President Barack Obama on December 16, 2016, one of the final bills he signed as president. The act required that the coins be issued \\"in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first crewed landing on the Moon\\". They were required to have a curved shape similar to the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame commemoratives. These coins, with the concave design for the obverse resembling a baseball glove, had been enormously popular. There were to be up to 50,000 Apollo 11 $5 gold pieces, or half eagles, 400,000 regular-sized silver dollars, 750,000 clad half dollars, and 100,000 additional silver dollars containing five troy ounces of silver and measuring three inches in diameter. All coins would have the same design, and would be available in uncirculated and in proof condition, except the five-ounce silver dollar, which would be in proof only. The design for the concave obverse could be selected through a design competition. A surcharge of $35 on the gold pieces, $50 on the five-ounce silver dollar, $10 on the smaller silver dollar and $5 on the half dollar would be collected. Once the Mint recouped its costs, half the remainder of the money would be distributed to the Smithsonian Institution Air and Space Museum for its \\"Destination: Moon\\" exhibit, one quarter to the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and one quarter to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation. The coins could only be issued during 2019. Apollo 11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act == Design ==  Selection  Obverse of silver dollar struck on December 13, 2018 From May 1 to June 29, 2017, the Mint accepted submissions for the coins' obverse design. Those whose concepts made the first cut would be notified by July 31, with revised submissions to be made by September 8. The obverse was not to include the image of any living person, including an astronaut, and was to be \\"emblematic of the United States space program leading up to the first crewed Moon landing\\". A total of 119 proposals were submitted, and a jury consisting of three members each of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the CCAC winnowed them down to 18 finalists. When the CCAC met on October 18, 2017, members were unenthusiastic, with some predicting a sales disaster and wanting to discard all the designs, but the chair, Mary N. Lannin said that one of them must be selected. The Fine Arts Commission met the following day; its members expressed some enthusiasm about the proposed designs. The jury members met and viewed the designs on October 20. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham and Sheryl Chaffee, daughter of Apollo 1 astronaut Roger Chaffee, unveil the reverse design. Mint Director David Ryder stands at podium. From the finalists, a design by Maine sculptor and medallist Gary Cooper was selected, depicting the bootprint of an astronaut on the Moon. Cooper had a longtime interest in coinage, and had submitted an unsuccessful entry in the 1998 Sacagawea dollar design competition, as well as an entry, also unsuccessful, for Maine's coin in the State Quarters series. The CFA had commented on the bootprint design, saying that it \\"may seem overly familiar\\". During the second round of the Apollo 11 competition, Mint officials had him submit modified versions of his entry, altering the position of elements of the design. It was one of these alternatives that won the competition. For his efforts, Cooper was paid a total of $5,500, with $500 an award for participation in the second round and the remainder the prize for winning. Cooper's concept was adapted for die production by Mint Sculptor-Engraver (now Chief Engraver) Joseph F. Menna. Artists at the Mint produced three designs for the reverse, and in June 2017, both CFA and CCAC agreed on one of them. That design was by U.S. Mint Sculptor-Engraver Phebe Hemphill, who also engraved her side of the coin. The two winning designs were unveiled on October 11, 2018 at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC in the presence of dignitaries such as Mint Director David J. Ryder and Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham. At the unveiling, Ryder stated the five-ounce silver dollars, once placed on sale, could sell out in ten minutes.  Description  Aldrin's bootprint on the Moon The shared obverse for the coins, created by Cooper, adapts the well- known photograph of an astronaut's bootprint, taken by Aldrin with a Hasselblad film camera, symbolizing the first step on the Moon. Cooper stated, \\"I recall seeing those first footprints, and it made so many people feel like that was their own footprint. I’ve never seen anything like that since.\\" He noted that the original photograph had darkness in the recesses of the bootprint, forcing him to be creative. Along the rim are the words , and , separated by phases of the Moon, becoming more full as the programs advance towards the Moon landing. is at the bottom, with above and to each side, the date 2019 (to left) and to the right. The initials of Cooper and Menna, and the mint mark of the facility where the coin was struck also appear on the obverse. Congress required that the image of Aldrin's helmet with Armstrong reflected in it form the basis for the reverse. Congress required that the reverse be a \\"close-up of the famous 'Buzz Aldrin on the Moon' photograph taken July 20, 1969, that shows just the visor and part of the helmet of astronaut Buzz Aldrin, in which the visor has a mirrored finish and reflects the image of the United States flag and the lunar lander and the remainder of the helmet has a frosted finish.\\" Although it is not usual for a living person to appear on a U.S. coin, Congress mandated it be done in this case, making Aldrin the seventh person depicted on a U.S. coin to be alive at the time it was struck by the Mint—the sixth, Nancy Reagan in 2016, was still alive at the time her entry in the First Spouse gold coin series was minted, but died before the official release. The convex shape of the reverse is meant to evoke the curvature of the visor on an astronaut's helmet. Hemphill stated, \\"I over- emphasized the curvature [in the scene] to create the illusion of the curved visor.\\" On the coins, the visor is framed by the words and , with the denomination appearing in its upper left; the Solar Wind Composition Experiment, visible in the original image, is omitted. In the reflection on the visor may be seen the Lunar Module Eagle, the United States flag (made more prominent than in the original), and the photographer, Neil Armstrong. == Striking == Reverse of the five-dollar gold piece On December 13, 2018, ceremonial first strikes of both sizes of the silver dollar took place at the Philadelphia Mint. Offspring of the Apollo 11 astronauts, Mark Armstrong, Andy Aldrin and Ann Collins struck both size coins. The dignitaries who struck coins would be allowed to purchase them once sales opened to the public. Mint Director Ryder also struck a five-ounce piece and predicted the coinage program would sell out. Such a sellout would generate $14.5 million in surcharges for the beneficiary organizations. The Mint had difficulty in determining the proper angle for the curves so that the coins would strike fully, working out techniques on the five-ounce dollar and adapting them for the smaller coins. Each die was created using cutting equipment, followed by hand finishing—no master die was used. Early attempts showed die cracks along the legs of the lunar lander, and problems with metal flow at Armstrong's hands. Adjustments, and a switch from .900 silver to .999, alleviated these problems. The two Apollo 11 silver dollars were the first U.S. commemoratives to be struck in .999 silver, with earlier silver commemoratives struck in .900. The change from the Mint's historic standard of .900 occurred because it had become little-used, causing the Mint to place custom orders with refineries; several years earlier, the Mint had obtained permission from Congress to strike coins of not less than 90 percent silver, allowing it to align with other world mints in using .999. The three-inch silver dollar was struck on the Philadelphia Mint's only Graebener GMP 1000 press, obtained to strike the America the Beautiful three-inch quarters. Each die for the five- ounce silver dollar initially took 14 hours to make and would strike about 100 coins; this figure was later reduced to 11.5 hours. In advance of the opening of sales on January 24, 2019, it was anticipated that some or all of the different varieties of the new coins might quickly sell out, marking the first time that had occurred since the Hall of Fame issue in 2014. That issue had seen the 50,000 gold coins sell out in a matter of minutes, with the 400,000 silver dollars gone in less than two weeks. The clad half dollars had not sold out, but more than 400,000 of the 750,000 had been sold, leading to surcharges totaling nearly $8 million for the designated beneficiary, the Baseball Hall of Fame. On January 18, introductory prices for the non-gold coins were announced; prices for the gold coins, which would fluctuate based on the market, would be determined closer to the opening of sales. The five-ounce silver dollar, from the Philadelphia Mint, would cost $224.95, with an initial household order limit of one. The smaller silver dollar would cost $54.95 for the proof coin and $51.95 in uncirculated, with a household order limit of 100. The half dollar in uncirculated condition, struck at the Denver Mint, was $25.95 each, and the proof coin (struck at the San Francisco Mint) was $27.95, with no order limit. A set containing both the proof Apollo 11 half dollar and a 2019–S Kennedy half dollar in enhanced reverse proof condition, restricted to 100,000 sets and with an order limit of five, cost $53.95. The set with the Kennedy half was issued to mark the connection between President Kennedy and the American space program. Prior to the January 24 opening of sales, prices for the gold pieces, struck at the West Point Mint, were set at $418.50 in proof and $408.50 in uncirculated, with an initial limit of one gold coin per household, regardless of condition. These prices were set from the Mint's Pricing of Numismatic Gold, Commemorative Gold, and Platinum Products table. == Distribution ==  Release  The set with two half dollars offered by the U.S. Mint A ceremony to mark the release of the Apollo 11 coins was held at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex on January 24, 2019. The CAPCOM during Eagle's landing, Apollo 16 Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke, spoke at the ceremony, stating the new issue would bring back memories of the day Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. Duke commended that the issue would raise money for worthy causes and stated he planned to buy some of the gold coins. Ryder had been scheduled to speak at the Florida event, but could not attend due to the ongoing partial government shutdown. The Apollo 11 coins went on sale to the public on January 24, 2019, at 12 noon EST through the Mint's website and via telephone; they were also available at the sales center at Mint headquarters in Washington, at the mints in Philadelphia and Denver, and at the ceremony site at Kennedy Space Center. Collectors reported minimal difficulties in placing their orders online, and although the three-inch dollar went into backorder status within an hour, figures released by the Mint showed that none of the coins had come near sellout on the first day of sales. The fact that none of the coins sold out on the day of issue brought varied reactions. Dave Harper, editor of Numismatic News, suggested the program might be a failure, and that the sales figures \\"do show a lack of early enthusiasm already.\\" Olson expressed pleasure with the first day's sales, predicted all would sell out by the end of the year, and noted that no collector had been shut out from getting coins. Coin forum bloggers deemed the sales to be dismal, and that they foretold a poor future for numismatics in the United States. A total of 296,311 Apollo 11 coins were sold in the first 24 hours, with the five-ounce silver dollar the leader both in number sold (51,271) and percentage of the mintage authorization sold (51.3 percent). At noon EST on January 25, the limit on the number of coins that could be sold to a single household was waived.  Continued sales  NASA Astronaut Christina Koch holds one of the half dollars aboard the International Space Station On January 29, the Mint announced that the packaging for the 70,000 half dollar sets that had been shipped, containing a 2019-S Apollo 11 half dollar in proof condition and a 2019–S Kennedy half dollar in enhanced reverse proof finish, contained a factual error. The packaging credited former chief engraver Gilroy Roberts with the design of both sides of the Kennedy half dollar when in fact he had designed only the obverse, with Frank Gasparro responsible for the reverse. The Mint halted shipments and made plans to print corrected packaging. The set was limited to 100,000 as that was the mintage limit of the special Kennedy half. Replacement sleeves were made available beginning in late May to customers who had purchased the half dollar set. Sales of the half dollar set reached 94,119 by February 10 and it showed as unavailable on the Mint's website. This foretold a sellout of the special Kennedy piece, which was only issued in the set, but not of the Apollo 11 half dollar—only 163,434 of these had been sold as of that date, just over a fifth of the authorized mintage. By February 21, the proof half dollar set had sold out entirely. On February 25 at 3 pm EST, introductory pricing ended, and prices increased by $5. Ryder had pledged at the December 2018 first strike ceremony to have some of the coins sent into space, and this came to pass on May 4, 2019, when a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft was launched with two 2019-S proof clad half dollars included in the payload for the International Space Station. They returned to Earth on June 3, also aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo craft. One flown coin was to form part of the \\"Destination: Moon\\" exhibit at the Smithsonian and the other to be displayed at Mint headquarters. On May 6, a product packaging a 2019-S Apollo 11 U.S. half dollar with a curved Australian $5 piece in commemoration of the Moon landing went on sale by the Royal Australian Mint (RAM), with production limited to 10,000. The RAM purchased the coins from the U.S. Mint at a bulk discount; the U.S. Mint provided publicity on its website and a link to the RAM's site. The Mint also partnered with Spain's Royal Mint in issuing sets of coins—both Australia and Spain hosted tracking stations for Apollo. 1,969 of the smaller silver dollar in proof condition were offered by the Royal Canadian Mint, with each coin encased in a silver bar, at a price of C$369.95 or $296.00 in U.S. currency. Apollo 11 $5 coin on sale at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, November 2019 By June 30, the Mint had sold 28,068 of the proof half eagles and 11,168 of the uncirculated. Sales of the smaller silver dollar were 171,957 in proof and 52,870 in uncirculated; of the larger, 61,037 had sold. The 2019–S Apollo 11 half dollar, a proof coin, had sold 99,997 units as part of the half dollar set and 55,297 by itself; the uncirculated half dollar from Denver had sold 36,820 pieces. Stories about the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing boosted sales in July; four of the Mint's ten highest-selling items for the week ending July 21 were Apollo 11 coins as the series enjoyed its best week's sales since February. Beginning on August 7, the Mint sold sets containing either the $5 piece or the smaller silver dollar in proof condition with a print in honor of Apollo 11 from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Prices were set at $78.95 for the print and silver dollar set and $19 above the price of the gold coin for the print/$5 piece set. Due to the rising price of gold, the Mint was selling the $5 piece for $485 by itself. The two new sales options went into backorder status the same day sales began. After 19 days of sales, through August 25, a total of 681 of the print/$5 piece sets and 2,570 of the print/silver dollar sets had sold. As of September 29, sales totaled: 31,331 proof half eagles by themselves (plus 825 sold with the print) and 11,713 uncirculated; 65,463 three-inch silver dollars; 200,712 smaller proof silver dollars by themselves (plus 3,122 with the print) and 56,960 uncirculated; 99,998 half dollar sets; 62,470 additional proof half dollars; and 40,170 uncirculated half dollars. At the Mint's Numismatic Forum held in Philadelphia in October, Mint Director Ryder predicted sales of 90,000 for the five-ounce silver dollar.  Conclusion of sales  Reverse of silver dollar struck on December 13, 2018 The Mint did not report weekly sales figures after November 3, 2019, due to the departure of the employees responsible for them, and the need to train a replacement. The next update was for sales through December 16, issued by a Mint spokesperson who indicated that regular weekly reports would not resume until January 2020. The report showed sales as: 32,597 proof half eagles by themselves (plus 1,095 sold with the print) and 11,969 uncirculated; 67,683 three-inch silver dollars; 216,077 smaller proof silver dollars by themselves (plus 4,683 with the print) and 59,158 uncirculated; 99,998 half dollar sets; 66,041 additional proof half dollars; and 41,449 uncirculated half dollars. By this time, the uncirculated half eagle was selling for $462.75 and in proof for $472.75. The Apollo 11 coins, as well as the other 2019 commemorative issue, the American Legion Centennial coins, went off sale on December 27, 2019, at 11:59 pm EST. Sales figures through January 12, 2020, released shortly afterwards, were subject to further adjustment by the Mint, but figures as of October 11, 2020 revealed no changes. The Apollo coins outsold the American Legion ones, which included a half dollar, smaller dollar and half eagle, each with the same mintage limits, by vast margins. William T. Gibbs, managing editor of Coin World, had predicted that the five-ounce silver dollars would sell out in 24 hours, and revisited his prediction in January 2020: \\"I obviously overestimated interest in the coin, which admittedly had strong selling points: It commemorated a truly significant event and was the nation’s first 5-ounce silver convex/concave coin.\\" Writing in early December, Joshua McMorrow-Hernandez of CoinWeek deemed the Apollo 11 coins \\"easily the US Mint’s most successful commemorative program since the aforementioned Baseball Hall of Fame coins in 2014.

In 2016, while on maternity leave for her daughter, Joey, Izumikawa began taking pictures of infant Joey – who is a deep sleeper – as she napped in various costumes as a way to send fun pictures to family and capture her time as a baby. The costumes were for the most part made from materials found around the house or borrowed from friends. The photos were taken with an iPhone. The photos were meant to be images that could go in a baby book, but Izumikawa also posted the photos on Instagram, where they were very popular. Netflix posted the picture of Joey dressed up as Barb from Stranger Things and then The Huffington Post wrote about Izumikawa's feed and Joey went viral. Many of the costumes feature different cultures from around the world and are sometimes sent in by fans. Some of the costumes are inspired by characters from movies and TV shows such as Star Wars (Han Solo), The Princess Bride (Inigo Montoya), Game of Thrones (Jon Snow), Braveheart (William Wallace), and Stranger Things (Barb). Some images feature the sleeping Joey wearing various outfits where she is a profession, like a baker, a sushi chef, or an Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter (Holly Holm), while others feature people from popular culture, like Sia, Beyoncé and DMC from Run-DMC. In 2017, Izumikawa published the book Naptime with Joey, which is a compilation of many of the photos on her Instagram feed. == Joey Choi == Izumikawa's daughter, Joey Marie Choi, was born on April 20, 2016.

D. Wyllie and Son, 1901. pp.130-131. This is proven in a charter from Abbot of Dunfermline, which identifies Richard as \\"Ric de Moravia fil Murdaci filii Alexandri de Moravia\\".Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, Volume 25, Gaelic Society of Inverness, 1907. He was also either the cousin, or nephew, of Hugh or Hugo de Moravia, also known as Hugh Freskin, who was the first Lord of Sutherland and whose son was William de Moravia, 1st Earl of Sutherland (d.1284). Richard's brother was Gilbert de Moravia (d.1245) who was Bishop of Caithness. ==Castle and lands== Richard de Moravia received from his elder brother, Gilbert, all of the lands that Gilbert had received from Hugo Freskyn, (also recorded as Hugo de Moravia) and the charter was confirmed by Alexander II of Scotland. Richard was also given Skelbo Castle by his brother Gilbert in 1235. ==Battle of Embo== The sarcophagus effigy of Richard de Moravia in Dornoch Cathedral William, Earl of Sutherland asked Richard de Moravia to engage a party of Danes (Vikings) who had landed at Littleferry, Sutherland until the Earl could come to his aid with a stronger force. The plan worked and the Danes were routed by the arrival of the Earl. However, Richard was killed during the battle. The Earl then arranged for Richard's body to be interred in Dornoch Cathedral and his damaged sarcophagus can still be seen there today. This was known as the Battle of Embo and took place in 1245. ==Family and descendants== Richard de Moravia married Marjorie Lascelles, the daughter and heiress of Alan de Lascelles.

Known for her avant-garde filmmaking style and interest in musical subjects, Tourtelot was a prominent female figure in the Chicago filmmaking community in the 1950s and 60s. She collaborated on films with notable artists such as John Steinbeck, Emilio Fernández, Harry Partch and Edward Bland. Tourtelot founded three artist institutions in the Midwestern United States, and is included in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Tourtelot also studied journalism and worked as a film critic, and a painter, jeweler, photographer, sculptor and printmaker. == Biography == Born in Alameda, California as Madeline Hanson, Tourtelot moved to Evanston, Illinois, as a young child. Tourtelot grew up in a musical family (her adoptive father was a classical pianist) and was drawn to the arts at an early age. Her close proximity to the galleries and museums in Chicago led her to pursue post-secondary studies in fine art. She eventually studied at a number of institutions around the Midwestern United States, including Smith College, Fish Creek Art Colony (where she studied painting under Vladimir Rousseff), Northwestern University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Design, and the Saugatuck Summer School of Painting. Tourtelot married wealthy Chicago architect Edward Tourtelot in 1935 at the age of 19. Edward Tourtelot helped to finance the openings of several art schools and galleries with Madeline. The couple had two children: Edward Jr. (1936) and Joan (1938). Tourtelot died on May 26, 2002. == Career == Tourtelot's met John Steinbeck and Emilio Fernández in 1947 while studying painting in Mexico. Steinbeck and Fernandez were working on the film version of Steinbeck's 1947 novel \\"The Pearl\\" and invited Tourtelot to help with production. Her experience with Steinbeck and Fernandez inspired the start to her career as a filmmaker. Tourtelot went on to become a significant contributor to Chicago's art scene and avant-garde filmmaking in the 1950s and 1960. She completed two films; Reflections and One by One (featuring music by Ed Bland) in 1955, as well as a series of short commissioned films set to classical music for Chicago's Educational channel in 1956. In 1957, Tourtelot met American composer Harry Partch through Robert Kostka, who was the art director at WTTW-TV in Chicago. Partch needed a filmmaker for a script he'd rewritten called U.S. Highball, and Kostka thought Tourtelot's filmmaking aesthetic would be in line with Partch's vision for the film. In 1958, she produced Windsong with Partch, the first of six collaborations between the two and the only film in which she acted. Other works include Rhythm on Canvas (1955), Reflections (1955), One by One (1955), The Poets Return (1962), and U.S. Highball (1968). In addition to her visual arts practice, Tourtelot founded three art institutions: the Ephraim Art School (1943), the Gallery Studio in Chicago's North Michigan Avenue arts district (1950s), and the Door Harbor School of Art (1965), now known as the Peninsula School of Art, where she was the school's director until 1971.Peninsula School of Art history Tourtelot donated part of her land, including two barns, to Peninsula Art Association in 1978. The school's archives include some of Tourtelot's original films, paintings, and photographs. Prior to working in film, Tourtelot was active in the fields of photography, printmaking, and painting. Her painting Escape is in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. She was also a long standing member of Cinema 16, an influential membership film society in New York City, and a critic for Films in Review and Chicago American, in which her writing often revealed her own aesthetic preferences. == Major works ==  Windsong  One of Tourtelot's most well-known works, Windsong, was produced in 1958. The work starred Tourtelot and artist Rudolph Seno, who at the time was a sculpture student at the Art Institute of Chicago's Saugatauk Summer school, where Tourtelot was working. The film consists of playful shots that Seno and Tourtelot captured of one another on the sand dunes of Lake Michigan's southeastern shore, along with shots of local botanical specimen and water. The score for Windsong was written by Harry Partch, who played 10 different instruments for the film. He was inspired by the playful imagery of Tourtelot and Seno, which reminded him of the legend of Apollo and Daphne.  Delusion of the Fury  Film based on the stage play by Harry Partch, subtitled A Ritual of Dream and Delusion. == Selected filmography == {  + !Film Title !year !collaborators - Rhythm on Canvas 1955 unknown - Reflections 1955 Edward Bland (music) - One by One 1955 unknown - Windsong 1958 Harry Partch (music), Rudolph Seno (actor) - Music Studio Harry Partch 1958 Harry Partch (music) - Rotate the Body 1961 Harry Partch (music) - The Poets Return 1962 unknown - U.S. Highball 1968 Harry Partch (music) } ==References *Peninsula School of Art *Ephraim Historical Foundation \\"History Speaks\\" Series - Madeline Tourtelot biography (lecture) Category:1915 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American filmmakers Category:American women film directors Category:Founders of schools in the United States Category:Filmmakers from Wisconsin Category:People from Alameda, California Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:American women journalists Category:American women experimental filmmakers Category:American women painters Category:Painters from Wisconsin Category:Art educators Category:20th-century American educators Category:20th-century American women artists ","title":"Madeline Tourtelot"},{"id":"56558801","text":"Bishop of Daejeon may refer to: *The bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Daejeon, South Korea *The bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Daejeon, South Korea Note: despite the differences of spelling above, Daejeon and Taejeon are different variants of spelling of the same city in South Korea.

It was one of the first PBM games to be moderated by computer. ==Gameplay== Pellic Quest was a PBM game for 10–15 players in which each participant took command of an entire alien race, jumping between over 200 worlds in search of galactic dominance. Players started by choosing to be one of six role types. Each had different abilities, and each earned victory points in a different way. # The Emperor used people and material to earn victory points. # The Crusader conquered and subjugated planets. # The Brigand was a pirate who raided planets, and built space fleets. # The Droyds were robots who earned points by destroying planet life and building more droyds. # The Trader used the production potential of each world. # The Zente were insectoid warriors that bred at a high rate and tried to destroy everything in their path. Each player started on a different home world with a given industrial capacity, production capability, number of soldiers and a stockpile of material (the game's currency). Each turn, each player mailed in an order sheet with computer codes for various orders: # Creation of star fleets, industry and soldiers # Movement # Combat, either on the ground or in space # Reconnaissance # Getting allies # Diplomacy The player who amassed a certain number of victory points first was the winner. The cost was $6 for the rulebook, and $1.50 per turn. ==Reception== In the September 1978 edition of Dragon (Issue 18), Dave Minch liked the fact that the game was computer moderated, which he had not experienced before. \\"With this there can be no bad die rolls, no faulty judge interpretation, and no over-balanced character overrunning the game. You play against known character types and can react accordingly so that you don’t make mistakes because of total ignorance. You always know exactly what your limitations are and what you must do to counteract them.\\" Minch concluded with a recommendation: \\"All things considered, the game is well worth trying and spending time on. I look for games of this type to happen much more frequently.\\" In the April–May 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 12), John Reynolds liked the multitude of possible actions that players were allowed. He concluded, \\"Pellic Quest is the first game to be produced by CIA and if it's anything to go by, the hobby of computer gaming is here to stay.\\" In a 1979 Game Survey held by The Space Gamer and published in the May–June 1980 edition (Issue 20), readers rated the game 5.6 out of 10. In the August 1981 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 42), Steve Jackson compared Pellic Quest favourably to its antecedent, Starweb, saying, \\"I'd recommend this to any StarWeb player who enjoys the original game and wants to try a variant - or to the tactics-oriented space gamer looking to 'get his feet wet' in PBM computer combat.\\" In 1985, the game tied with DuelMasters, Power, and Quest of the Great Jewels for Third Place in the 1st Annual Paper Mayhem Awards for \\"Best PBM Game\\". ==References== Category:Play- by-mail games ","title":"Pellic Quest"},{"id":"56558936","text":"The 1972 Omloop Het Volk was the 27th edition of the Omloop Het Volk cycle race and was held on 4 March 1972.

It marks the southeastern end of the East Eifel volcano field and rises to a height of , about 170 metres above the Pellenz region, and is visible from a long way off. In the UNO Year of Mountains (2002), the Karmelenberg was Mountain/Hill of the Month in Germany. A monument records the proclamation on 21 June 2002. As part of the Volcano Park (station 21), the hill is counted as a tourist attraction. Various information boards explain both its volcanic past as well as the history of St. Mary’s Chapel at the summit. The hill is named after Mount Carmel in the Carmel massif, an important Biblical site and modern landmark in northwestern Israel. The entire cinder cone of the Karmelenberg has been designated as a nature reserve. == Location == The Karmelenberg belongs to the municipality of Bassenheim and is situated close to the Ochtendung junction on the A 48 motorway. Nearby is the Goloring, an important area monument. The Karmelenberg may be climbed from Bassenheim up a 1.5-kilometre-long avenue (natural monument ND-7137-386), from Ochtendung or from the L 52 from Koblenz to Polch. == Geology == The cinder cone of the Karmelenberg is part of a volcanic group with ten eruption centres that was active about 350,000 to 300,000 years ago. In addition to the Karrmelenberg main top, there are also the Schweinskopf and the so-called Oberholzgruppe, of which no trace is visible any longer. The Schweinskopf is almost completely levelled due to quarrying. The Karmelenberg Group lies partly on the edge fault of the Neuwied Basin. On its north side, the Devonian bedrock of Hunsrück slates is about 100 metres down. On the south side lie riparian gravels of the Ur-Moselle. The three lava flows that emanated from the Karmelenberg are covered by pumice and loess. == Quarrying == The large quarry, which is still visible, was established in the 20th century. The high, vertical faces of the outcrop were produced by a special, high risk, quarrying technique known as Hohlmachen (“cave making”). At the foot off the rock face a low cave was hewn out and filled with wood. After blowing up the wooden props, large areas of the rock face collapsed to the ground. == Nature reserve == The Karmelenberg Nature Reserve (NSG-7137-031) has an area of 10.74 ha. It was designated on 7 May 1981 by the Bezirksregierung Koblenz. Its aim is the preservation of the Karmelenberg for scientific and cultural reasons due to its geological character including its outcrops, it habitat for rare and endangered wild flowers and plants and its natural beauty and uniqueness.Rechtsverordnung über das „Naturschutzgebiet Karmelenberg“ der Bezirksregierung Koblenz dated 7 May 1981, with effect from 19 May 1981 (pdf; 86 kB) == References  See also == *List of volcanoes in Germany Category:Cinder cones Category:Mountains and hills of the Eifel Category:Nature reserves in Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Mountains and hills of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Mayen-Koblenz ","title":"Karmelenberg"},{"id":"56558977","text":"Emma Isaacs is an Australian entrepreneur.

In 1995, he was the first artist selected in the annual “Master Artist” program conducted by the City of Atlanta Office of Cultural Affairs. He would later be inducted into The HistoryMakers in 2006. == Early life == Alexander was born James Alexander on August 7, 1935, in Waldwick, New Jersey as one of 12 children to auto mechanic David Alexander, and Frances James Alexander. He attended Waldwick Public School and Ramsey High School. He grew up during a time where the opportunities for Blacks in America to economically advance were few. == Career ==  Beginnings  In 1952, Alexander joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 17. During his time in Naval boot camp in Bainbridge, MD, one event would help shape the course of his entire life; Alexander won his first camera, a Kodak \\"Brownie Hawkeye\\" in a friendly dice game. Immediately putting his new camera to use, Alexander sold photographs to the other sailors for fifty cents each. Once he finished boot camp, he was transferred to a naval base in Charleston, S.C. to begin training as a diesel engineman. While in Charleston he asked the naval base photographer to look over some of his work, and he began teaching him about 35mm and large format photography. After leaving the Navy in 1956, Alexander put photography on hold for several years. He managed a pool hall and detailed cars. He lived above the pool hall, which was called a rooming house. The rooms were rented for $9 a week. That room and tiny bed became Alexander's home during what he called his \\"street time.\\" In 1964 he moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey from Paterson where he lived following his discharge and launched his professional career as a freelance photographer. Alexander completed courses for a certificate in business organization and management at Rutgers University, while he worked as general manager of a newspaper delivery service. He also enrolled at New York Institute of Photography (NYIP) and earned a degree in commercial photography in 1968. He later became a part of NYIP Famous Alumni During the height of the human rights movement, Alexander began documenting the anti-war and civil rights movement, and later the local and national responses to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination in 1968. His photographs included: marches, rallies, conferences, meetings, festivals, concerts, and Black life as a whole. He entitled the body of work Spirits/Martyrs/Heroes and continued to add photographs to the collection over the ensuing years The collection ranges from the 1960s to the present. It encompasses a variety of subjects from the human and civil rights movement, politics, music, art, and everyday individuals who were consistent in their pursuit of equality. On a bus trip from Ridgewood, New Jersey to New York, Alexander met Eric Maristany. They both were traveling with cameras, so conversation between the two sparked. Maristany worked at a filmstrip company in Ridgewood and invited Alexander to visit the studio. After visiting the studio a few days later, he met owner Richard Bruner, and staff of Bruner Productions; producers of educational and civil rights movement filmstrips. He became a volunteer at the studio after gaining respectability as a documentary photographer. Alexander began freelancing at Bruner Productions.  Music icons  Alexander is also known for his document of Black inspired music, prominently jazz and blues. When he photographed different events, he realized that the event would open with a musical selection. He started to appreciate the influence music had on the African American community, and it revealed the importance of musicians. \\"I am just a lover of music. There was a lot going on in the '50s and '60s, in New Jersey, where all the little clubs or corner bars had a trio or quartet playing. I was really listening to the music.\\" He then decided he would incorporate black music in his work. In 1988, Alexander curated his own exhibit entitled Blues Legacy for the first National Black Arts Festival. He curated the Duke and Other Legends: Jazz Photographs by Jim Alexander that same year. The exhibit featured 50 classical jazz musicians that toured 13 southern cities through a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Southern Arts Federation. The resilience and creativity of African American culture captivates the world whether it is through music, art or the written word. Jazz music is just one example of the beauty birthed by African Americans in spite of the hatred and marginalization that was designed to break their spirits. Alexander juxtaposed images of the ugly barriers created by hatred as well as the elegant strength of those who dare to shatter them. He has spent years documenting jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Count Basie just to name a few.  Gordon Parks  Jim Alexander with Gordon Parks Clark College, Atlanta, GA 1988 Alexander met and became friends with documentary photographer Gordon Parks in 1968. Parks was influential in the direction of his photographic career. \\"A photo can be taken to build, or it can be taken to destroy, and that decision rests in the hands of the photographer.\\" Alexander recognized how his photographs could affect the awareness of the subject and the viewer. Moved to dedicate ten years of his life and work to documenting human rights and the Black experience; he shared this intention with Parks. Parks said, “that sounds good James, but your ass is going to starve; nobody is going to pay you just to run around shooting anything that interests you.” So Alexander decided to teach others the art of photography while shooting documentary work on the side. Parks approved his decision and told him, “That sounds better.\\" Fifty plus years have surpassed since having that conversation with the late Gordon Parks, and Alexander continues his documentary work. Alexander believes that each photo contains burrows that sends a message deep into the viewer's conscious. His photos have the aesthetic of a participant observer. As described by Alexander, \\"a participant observer acknowledges the undeniable influence of his mere presence, while pleading allegiance to the role of the spectator.\\" Alexander's images help call attention to gross violations of human rights in the United States over the course of many decades.  Educator  Alexander has mentored and taught photography at various colleges and universities such as Yale University, Emory University, Fulton County Arts Council, Spelman College, TRIO and Upward Bound Programs at Clark College (better known as Clark Atlanta University), Morris Brown College, and Atlanta Metropolitan College. In 1970, Alexander was hired as a consultant and photography instructor for Yale University's School of Art and Architecture's Black Environmental Studies Team (B.E.S.T) and The Black Workshop. He also served as executive director of a community arts organization from 1972 to 1976. Atlanta became home to Alexander and his family in 1976 after he accepted a position as the director of audiovisual communications for the Atlanta Office of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. This was a non-profit established to save, protect, and expand the landholdings of Black family farmers in the south. At Clark College (better known as Clark Atlanta University), Alexander served as Photographer-in-Residence from 1984–1990. During his time at Clark Atlanta, Alexander established a mentoring program where he helped students who worked with the campus newspaper, yearbook, and various types of photography. He also documented meetings and events leading up to the historic ribbon cutting for the AU/CC CAU merger.thumb306x306pxSelf-portrait of Jim Alexander in his studio at The Neighborhood Arts Center Atlanta, GA 1978 The Neighborhood Arts Center (NAC) originated in 1975, and became the heart of Atlanta's Black Arts Movement. The center was constructed in the image of Atlanta's first African American Mayor, Maynard Jackson. In 1977, Alexander became photographer in residence at The NAC. He was proactive in maintaining the historical values The NAC instituted. In 1978, Alexander documented a historic visit to the NAC by Romare Bearden, a legendary artist and author, and his wife Nanette Bearden. As a strong believer in “art for people’s sake,” Alexander established an organization called, Freedom Arts Communications Team (F.A.C.T. INC.) in 1972. F.A.C.T. was a collective of artists; musicians, visual artists, poets, media professionals, community advocates, theater group members, and mentors. By launching a community arts festival, working with schools, the Police Athletic League and community development offices, they created a visiting artist program to serve youth and adults in the New Haven, CT area. From 1996 – 1999, Alexander was a coordinator and instructor of the youth photography program called “As Seen by Teens” photography and journalism program. As Seen by Teens was a summer photojournalism program designed to give young students a better sense of themselves and their communities. Implemented by Nexus Contemporary Art Center, the program encouraged creativity while it challenged students to learn and show self-respect, achieve goals, and gain a marketable skill. From 1998 – 2000, Alexander was director of Arts for All gallery and Community Events. VSA arts of Georgia (formally Arts for All) provided arts education and cultural arts opportunities for Georgians with disabilities, or who are disadvantage or institutionalized.  First World Bookstore  The love for education, reading, and black culture led Alexander to be a co-founder of First World Bookstores in Atlanta, GA during 1988. The store specialized in predominately African American books, gifts, and art; which eventually expanded to five bookstores in the metropolitan area until 1994.  Jim-Alex Studio Gallery  While in New Haven, CT Alexander opened a photo studio, Jim-Alex Studio Gallery in 1971. He exhibited the works of other photographers as well as his own. The studio became a meeting place and hub for artists and activists of all kinds. Community meetings were frequently held there, and The Connecticut Black Media Coalition was established at his studio. Alexander jokes, “Everything happened in my studio but photography.”  Organizations  Alexander has been instrumental in the founding of several organizations of professional photographers, including the Photographers’ Collective, the Atlanta Photographers Group, and Zone Three. He is a founding member and past executive vice chairman of the National Black Media Coalition, and completed two terms as president of African Americans for the Arts, (AAFTA). Alexander is also a member of the American Photography Archives Group, (APAG) which is a 501(c)(3) non-profit resource organization for individuals who own or manage a privately held photography archive. Alexander belongs to the National Alliance of Artists from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (NAAHBU) which is an organization founded on May 19, 2000 on Morris Brown College campus in Atlanta, GA. The organization features artists that have taught, studied, or worked in art departments and programs at HBCUs. == Selected shows and exhibits == * 2018: Live the Legacy Series Installation #1, The National Center for Civil and Human Rights, Atlanta, GA.

(February 18, 1930 – November 26, 2017), was a French Dominican Order priest and lawyer, who spent forty years working with and defending Brazilian peasants forced into labor or harassed by wealthy landowners. Landowners repeatedly threatened his life in an attempt to stop this work. In Brazil, he was known as \\"counsel for the landless\\". ==Early life and work== Born February 18, 1930 to an upper middle class family, Burin des Roziers obtained degrees in literature from the Sorbonne, comparative law from the University of Cambridge, and in 1957 a doctor of law at the Faculty of Law of Paris. While at Cambridge Burin des Roziers met the Dominican Yves Congar, who had a profound influence on him. Burin des Roziers entered the Dominican order in 1958 and after ordination as a Dominican priest 1963, he worked as a chaplain with law and economics students in Paris. Burin des Roziers became close to and worked with the Dominican and worker-priest Jean Raguenès. In 1970 he began work as a social worker in Annecy (Hautes-Savoie), working particularly with Tunisian immigrants. ==Work in Brazil== In 1978, Burin des Roziers left for Brazil, where he became a lawyer for the landless people who lived at the edge of the Amazon rainforest. Burin des Roziers was instrumental in helping more than 50,000 people who worked in forced labor for wealthy landowners who controlled the majority of rural lands. In 2000, as a lawyer for the Pastoral Commission of the Earth in the State of Pará, Burin des Roziers received death threats from a fazendeiro, one of the wealthy hacienda owners (latifundists), who was also responsible for the assassination of a union leader. In 2005, after the assassination of the American missionary Dorothy Stang, Burin des Roziers was again threatened with death, as were many trade unionists and religious advocates who worked with the poor. A contract was placed against him by the fazendeiros, for 50,000 reals or 20,000 euros. ==Honors== As a result of his works, Burin des Roziers received the Legion of Honor in 1994, and the Ludovic-Trarieux international human rights prize in 2005. ==Death== Burin des Roziers reluctantly left Brazil in 2014 after suffering three strokes and died from natural causes in Paris on November 26, 2017 at the convent of Paris Saint-Jacques. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Members of the Dominican Order Category:French Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Henri Burin des Roziers"},{"id":"56559167","text":"Alice Robinson (born 1 December 2001) is a New Zealand alpine ski racer.

The film was directed by Dave Fleischer. == Plot == In the middle of the jungle, all animals go to school singing along. Among these animals is an elephant who leads the chorus, a piglet who is full of mud, and a highly indifferent hippo, who walks so slow that a snail rapidly passes him. When they arrive in class, the elephant sits in front of a hostile monkey that uses a washboard to hit and annoy the elephant. In the meantime, the hippo simply sits outside the class and soundly sleeps. The teacher, a goose, sings another song while asking the animals various questions. They all reply they can't remember, however, the elephant proceeds to remind them that he never forgets. This continues until the goose asks the elephant a simple math question, to which he shamefully admits to forget, and the class retorts him for it. After this, the goose makes the class take a test, which she leaves in charge of the turtle. As a joke, the animals use their quill pens to target the turtle's back, which looks like a dartboard. After the test, the goose lets the class go home. The hippo then wakes up, and this time he gleefully runs home faster than a rabbit. As the animals finish their sing along song, the monkey kicks the elephant, but gets hurt as the elephant placed the washboard in his overalls. He then hits the monkey in the head, and cheerfully recites his favorite slogan, \\"An elephant never forgets.\\" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026310/ == Cast == Gus Wickie as the elephant/hippo == Animation department == *Roland Crandall: animator *Seymour Kneitel: animator *Jack Scholl: lyrics: song *Sammy Timberg: music: song *Lou Fleischer: music supervisor (uncredited) *Sammy Timberg: musical director (uncredited) == References  External links == * * Category:Great Depression films Category:Color Classics cartoons Category:Fleischer Studios short films Category:American short films Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:Short films directed by Dave Fleischer Category:1934 animated films Category:1934 films Category:American animated short films Category:American films Category:American buddy films Category:Animated buddy films ","title":"An Elephant Never Forgets"},{"id":"56559333","text":"Abbott Gleason (21 July 1938 – 25 December 2015) was professor emeritus of history and faculty member at the Watson Institute, Brown University.

Its primary host is rose, and its secondary host is a grass, including cereals such as wheat, barley, oats and rye. It is an important vector of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) which causes serious reductions in yields of affected crops. ==Distribution== The rose-grass aphid has an almost cosmopolitan distribution, being found in most parts of the world where its secondary hosts are grown. It was first detected in New Zealand in 1982. ==Description== Wingless adults are between long, slender, glossy yellowish-green with a darker dorsal stripe. The antennae, legs and siphunculi (erect, backward- pointing tubes on the abdomen) are relatively long and pale in colour. Winged individuals are between long and a uniform green colour. ==Life cycle== The species overwinters on rose, its primary host, as an egg. On hatching in the spring, rose-grain aphids feed on rose at first, but do not persist on it beyond about June in the northern hemisphere, dispersing to grasses and cereal crops in midsummer. On its primary host, it is less harmful than is the rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae), but in some years the plants may be littered with white nymphal cases and large numbers of winged females may develop in late spring and migrate in \\"clouds\\" to its secondary hosts. Cereals that are used by this aphid as their secondary hosts include wheat, barley, oats and rye. Research in New Zealand showed that barley and oats were more affected by this pest than was wheat, possibly because the lower leaves of wheat, on which the aphids tended to congregate, became senescent early in the year, giving conditions unsuitable for the further growth of the aphid. ==Symptoms on cereals== Symptoms shown by the host plant include abnormally coloured and contorted foliage, deposits of honeydew with subsequent growth of sooty mould, yellowing of foliage and early senescence. This aphid is one of the most important vectors of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). ==References== Category:Macrosiphini Category:Insects described in 1849 ","title":"Metopolophium dirhodum"},{"id":"56559425","text":"Public artworks on display in Prague include: * Babies (Černý) * Bust of Václav Štulc * Ctirad and Šárka * František Palacký Monument, Prague * Head of Franz Kafka * Holy Trinity Column, Malá Strana * Jan Hus Memorial * Josef Dobrovský Monument * Kohl's Fountain * Kranner's Fountain * Libuše and Přemysl * Lumír and Píseň * Marian column Old Town Square * Memorial to the Victims of Communism * Obelisk (Prague Castle) * Piss (Černý) * Polibek (Petřín) * Réva * Slavín * Stalin Monument (Prague) * Statue of Alois Jirásek, Prague * Statue of Bedřich Smetana, Prague * Statue of Charles IV, Křižovnické Square * Statue of Franz Kafka * Statue of Jan Neruda, Prague * Statue of Jaroslav Hašek * Statue of John of Nepomuk, Vyšehrad * Statue of John the Baptist, Maltézské Square * Statue of Josef Jungmann * Statue of Judah Loew ben Bezalel * Statue of Karel Havlíček Borovský, Prague * Statue of Mikuláš Karlach * Statue of Milan Rastislav Štefánik, Prague * Statue of Saint George, Prague Castle * Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Square * Statue of Saint Procopius (Vyšehrad) * Statue of Saint Sebastian (Vyšehrad) * Statue of Saint Wenceslas (Bendl) * Statue of Saint Wenceslas (Vosmík) * Statue of Saint Wenceslas, Wenceslas Square * Statue of Taras Shevchenko, Smíchov * Statue of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, Prague * Trigae (National Theatre) * Vítězslav Hálek Memorial * Wimmer's Fountain * Winged Lion Memorial * Woodrow Wilson Monument * Wrestling Titans * Youth * Záboj and Slavoj * Znovuzrození ==Charles Bridge== Statues on Charles Bridge include: * Calvary, Charles Bridge * Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge * Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge * Statue of Augustine of Hippo, Charles Bridge * Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge * Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge * Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge * Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge * Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge * Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge * Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge * Statue of Jude the Apostle, Charles Bridge * Statue of Lutgardis, Charles Bridge * Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge * Statue of Philip Benizi de Damiani, Charles Bridge * Statue of Pietà, Charles Bridge * Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge * Statue of Saint Cajetan, Charles Bridge * Statue of Saint Christopher, Charles Bridge * Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Bridge * Statue of Saint Ludmila, Charles Bridge * Statue of Vitus, Charles Bridge * Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge * Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge * Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge * Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge * Statues of Saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth, Charles Bridge * Statues of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Charles Bridge * Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge * Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund * Statues of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius, Charles Bridge Category:Culture in Prague Prague ","title":"List of public art in Prague"},{"id":"56559427","text":"Soulfly is an American heavy metal band from Phoenix, Arizona. Formed by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Max Cavalera following his departure from Sepultura in 1997, the group originally included lead guitarist Jackson Bandeira, bassist Marcelo \\"Cello\\" Dias and drummer Roy \\"Rata\\" Mayorga. Bandeira left after the recording of the band's self-titled debut album, with former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader taking his place in April 1998 for the album's touring cycle. Mader had left by the following January, with Mikey Doling joining in his place. Mayorga departed the group in July 1999, with Joe Nunez announced as his replacement in November. Nunez performed on the 2000 album Primitive, but left the following October due to concerns with his \\"financial arrangement with the group\\". Mayorga returned in his place. In September 2003, Dias was fired from Soulfly by Cavalera and his wife Gloria (the band's manager), which prompted Doling and Mayorga to leave. The departed members were quickly replaced by returning drummer Nunez, Primer 55 guitarist Bobby Burns on bass, and former Ill Niño guitarist Marc Rizzo. The group's lineup subsequently remained stable for a number of years, before Burns left in July 2010, shortly after the release of Omen. Fireball Ministry's Johny Chow filled in for a string of tour dates, before Tony Campos (formerly of Static-X) joined as Burns' full-time replacement in 2011. Shortly after Campos' addition, Nunez left Soulfly and was replaced temporarily by Cavalera's son Zyon. Borknagar's David Kinkade subsequently joined in September, performing on the group's eighth studio album Enslaved.

There is before the apex a large rounded reddish yellow spot bearing a black ocellus composed of two and having two small white pupils. The hindwing is without markings. On the forewing beneath the yellow spot is larger and lighter than above, being more ochre -yellow, the double ocellus having bright white pupils. The hindwing beneath dark brown, thinly dusted with whitish, especially towards the costa. At the apex of the cell a rounded white spot , and before the distal margin 3 — 4 white dots. Antenna black-brown above, finely ringed with white and brown beneath, except the russet-brown club. The sexes are the same in markings and size, but the yellow spot of the forewing is paler in the female than in the male. Elwes found some specimens with accessory ocelli below the large subapical ocellus. — This species is the first of that group of Erebias which come nearest to the preceding genus (Callerebia). It resembles Callerebia also in that it is not a really alpine insect, but occurs more in the hills.

He received from the University of Colorado his bachelor's degree in 1914 and master's degree in 1915. He was a secondary school teacher in Cripple Creek, Colorado from 1915–1917 and then moved to Washington, D.C. as an analyst in a federal office. In 1918 he was transferred to Chicago. In 1919 Mints enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, where he was assigned to teach undergraduate courses. He completed several graduate courses in economics and was promoted to assistant professor of political economy in 1923. He taught introductory economics courses until 1928 when he was put in charge of teaching money and banking courses. He retired as professor emeritus in 1953. Mints was an advocate of the view that the Federal Reserve System should have increased the quantity of money during the years from 1929 to 1933. Mints was also a main critic of the real bills doctrine in the 20th century. Mints had a strong influence on development of Chicago monetary economics, in particular on Milton Friedman's thinking. ==Selected publications== Articles *Mints, Lloyd, \\"The Elasticity of Banknotes,\\" Journal of Political Economy, 38, August 1920, pp. 458–71. *Mints, Lloyd, \\"Open Market Borrowing to Finance the Production of Goods Sold for Future Delivery,\\" Journal of Political Economy, 31, February 1923, pp. 128–38. *Mints, Lloyd, \\"Expansion of Fixed and Working Capital by Open Market Borrowing,\\" Journal of Political Economy, 31, April 1923, pp. 299–302. *Mints, Lloyd, \\"Monetary Policy,\\" Review of Economics and Statistics, 28, May 1946, pp. 60–69. *Mints, Lloyd, \\"Monetary Policy and Stabilization,\\" American Economic Review (Supplement), 41, May 1951, pp. 188–193. *Mints, Lloyd and others, \\"Monetary Policy: Discussion,\\" American Economic Review (Supplement), 43, May 1953, pp. 54–60.

The chapel is designated as a \\"Category A\\" listed building by Historic Scotland. The murals are Phoebe Traquair's first professional commission, and the sole survivor of around 20 commissions instigated by Patrick Geddes' Edinburgh Social Union. They were described in 1887 as \\"the most important and memorable portion of the art of the Social Union\\" and in an August 1891 letter to her nephew, Traquair says \\"I myself believe that in some ways I shall never do better or maybe as well\\". == First Mortuary Chapel == The original mortuary chapel was located at the Lauriston Lane site of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. In April 1885, Traquair was approached by the Edinburgh Social Union and asked if she would decorate a converted coalhouse on the original hospital site at Lauriston Lane, now to be used as a mortuary chapel. The building was small, only 3-metres by 4-metres, but the hospital ladies committee hoped that it could become “a suitable place where the bodies can be left reverently and lovingly for the parents before the burials”. As a mother of three children herself, Traquair was happy to accept the commission. The decorations were completed in 1886 and strongly reflect themes of motherhood and the redemption of mankind. In a time when as many as 8% of children did not live to see their first birthday, Traquair aimed to offer comfort and support to grieving parents through her decoration scheme. In style she draws on interpretations of medieval illuminated manuscripts and Eastern Orthodox imagery, in a mixture of realism and Symbolism. A review in the Scottish Art Review by Gerald Baldwin Brown in 1889 refers to the murals as “...a piece of illumination enlarged”. == Second Mortuary Chapel == In 1891, the Sick Children’s hospital moved to a new site at Rillbank in Sciennes and the little chapel was abandoned. The second chapel was built as part of Washington Browne's overall design for the hospital and is a single storey building in red sandstone located at the northeast corner of the main hospital building. Although the old hospital site had been acquired by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh the murals were at risk of slow destruction as the chapel was no longer being used. Then, thanks to a petition led by Traquair herself, in 1894 some of the murals were successfully transported to a new purpose-built mortuary chapel. There were significant technical and logistical difficulties; indeed some of the panels were moved and installed still attached to the bricks of the old building. As the new mortuary was larger than the original, panels from the first scheme were repaired, surrounded with fresh plaster, and the spaces filled with an enlarged decoration scheme. Although the two schemes are united by their use of colour, the second scheme deliberately uses a simpler and more childlike manner. The mortuary chapel remains in use within the Sick Children’s Hospital, though curtains have been installed so that the murals can be covered when required, as the religious themes reflected in the images are not always appropriate. In September 2017, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children was sold to property developers, including the Mortuary Chapel. == Gallery == File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 31.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 56.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 53.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 50.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 48.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 15.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 27.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 29.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 37.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 28.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 32.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 14.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 08.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 51.jpg File:Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Mortuary Chapel Murals, Edinburgh 33.jpg == References == Category:Chapels in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Edinburgh Category:Murals in the United Kingdom Category:19th-century architecture Category:Arts and Crafts movement Category:Chapels in Scotland ","title":"Mortuary Chapel, Royal Hospital for Sick Children"},{"id":"56559562","text":"James Matheson (1796–1878) was a Scottish trader in India.

The team played its home games at Vidzemes Ledus Halle in Ogre until 2017 when the new arena was built in Rumbula, Riga. ==History== HK Kurbads was founded by Andis Pikans, Janis Siraks and Gints Zviedritis in 1996 as an amateur team and played in various amateur championships until 2013 when they joined Latvian Hockey Higher League. The team started playing its home games at Ogre. In their debut season, as several stronger players joined the team they won the regular season, yet lost in the play-off final to HK Prizma. For 2014-15 season team were joined by players like Rodrigo Laviņš and Aleksandrs Macijevskis and desipe finishing only 3rd on regular season, they reached finals again, just to lose HK Mogo in series 2 to 4. In 2016 team reached finals for the third time and this time lost to HK Liepāja in series 3 to 4. That was the first time in history for a Latvian Hockey League final requiring all 7 games to decide the winner. As for 2015–16 Latvian Cup was resurrected Kurbads managed to reach finals, where they lost to HK Mogo. In 2017 Kurbads reached finals for the 4th time and this time losing 0 to 3 games in series, managed to come back and win against HK Mogo, therefore winning their first championship and qualifying for next seasons IIHF Continental Cup. In Latvian Cup they reached finals and lost to HK Mogo for the second time 2:3 OT.

In Latvian Cup they reached finals again, yet lost once again in a thrilling game to HK Mogo 2:3 OT. In league, despite finishing regular season in 3rd place, they managed to sweep the finals against HK Zemgale to win for the second year in a row. ==Rivalry with HK Mogo== As both teams being based in Riga and having frequently played against each other in several league and cup finals, it has started a small rivalry between two, and therefore even the regular season meetings carry some increased significance to both teams. ==Season by season results== {  style=\\"text- align:center;font-size:95%;\\" - !width=200Season !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=30 !width=100Finish !width=200Playoff - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2013–14 Latvian Hockey League  30  19  3  5  3  172  90  68  1st style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Lost in final 2–4 (HK Prizma) - style=\\"text- align:left;\\"2014–15 Latvian Hockey League  30  20  1  2  7  167  81  64  3rd style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Lost in final 2–4 (HK Mogo) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2015–16 Latvian Hockey League  30  18  4  3  5  162  74  64  3rd style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Lost in final 3–4 (HK Liepāja) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016–17 Latvian Hockey League  30  19  3  1  7  144  83  64  2nd style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Won in final 4–3 (HK Mogo) - style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017–18 Latvian Hockey League  30  17  2  4  7  131  75  59  3rd style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Won in final 4–0 (HK Zemgale) } Tournaments *2015–16 Latvian Cup – Lost to HK Mogo 3–4 in the final. *2016–17 Latvian Cup – Lost to HK Mogo 2–3 in the final. *2017–18 Latvian Cup – Lost to HK Mogo 2–3 OT in the final. *2017–18 IIHF Continental Cup – 3rd in Group D of the Third Round.

It was built from 1939 to 1940 as a New Deal project to provide motorists with a scenic view of Lake Pepin. It was designed by landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols and constructed by the National Youth Administration. The overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 for its state-level significance in the themes of landscape architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for exemplifying the early highway waysides built in Minnesota with federal work relief aid, and for exemplifying as well National Park Service rustic style and the work of Nichols. ==Description== The Reads Landing Overlook stands northwest of Reads Landing, Minnesota, and southeast of Lake City. It is situated on a stretch of Route 61 that runs due east/west along the south shore of Lake Pepin, a natural widening of the Mississippi River. Views from the overlook encompass the lake and its surrounding river valley, which is lined by wooded, bluffs on either shore. The bluffs of the south shore rise immediately adjacent to the roadbed of Route 61. The overlook is built on a narrow strip of fill between the highway and a line of shoreside railroad tracks. The overlook's lakeside edge is defined by a retaining wall of random- coursed ashlars of Oneota Dolomite. The wall is thick with piers anchoring it at regular intervals. The midpoint of the symmetrical wall is bowed out to create a lookout bay that projects farther out toward the lake. At either end of the site, the retaining wall curves into bays with interpretive markers. The parking area has parallel parking space for four cars. A island with a stone curb once separated parking area from the highway. This and a five-car parking area on the opposite side of the road were largely eliminated when the highway was widened.

It is set into a freestanding wall of dolomite with decorative brickwork. Below the main plaque is a small bronze marker crediting construction to the National Youth Administration. The interpretive marker at the west end is unique. It takes the form of a bronze medallion with a geographical map of Minnesota. It is set on top of a square brick pedestal. The east and west markers are both flanked by walls with decorative herringbone brickwork and sport wide limestone steps at their feet. The overlook plaza was originally paved with flagstones punctuated by five insets paved with asphalt. In 1994 the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) repaved the plaza with poured concrete to make it more handicap- accessible. Some of the flagstones were retained and placed in the configuration of the original asphalt insets, inverting the initial design but retaining the contrast of smooth and flagged surfaces. At the same time MnDOT added two concrete benches to the lookout bay, making up for the three limestone benches that had deteriorated and been removed over the intervening decades. The lookout bay sports two interpretive signs added in the late 20th century. The first is a traditional black metal marker on a pole, placed in 1985 by MnDOT and the Minnesota Historical Society. The second is a modern interpretive sign printed on plastic, installed by MnDOT and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 1988 and slightly relocated during the 1994 renovations. ==History== The Reads Landing Overlook is a distinctive example of Minnesota's first highway waysides, established in the 1930s and 40s as automobile tourism became popular. Overlooks were designed to provide a standard place for motorists to pull safely off the road for scenic views, rather than stopping randomly on road shoulders. The Reads Landing Overlook is uniquely adapted to a very narrow site and atypically combines elements of a scenic wayside with those of an interpretive wayside. The adjacent highway was promoted as a scenic route from the first days of automobile touring in the 1910s. At that time the road system was not yet codified, and private groups took charge of marking and promoting routes. In 1921 the state highway system was formally organized, with this road along Minnesota's eastern border from Iowa to Canada becoming Highway 1. Four years later it was designated as part of U.S. Route 61. Long a gravel road, 61 was first paved through this vicinity in 1936. Owing to its importance and heavy use, the initial paving was done in concrete rather than cheaper but less durable asphalt. In 1938 an interstate commission formed to plan the Great River Road. Though Minnesota's portion would not be officialized until 1959, the portion along Lake Pepin was recognized as a scenic highlight from the beginning. As use of the highway system expanded, the Minnesota Highway Department (later renamed the Minnesota Department of Transportation or MnDOT) opened the Roadside Development Division to concentrate on wayside facilities. The goal of these facilities was to improve highway aesthetics, increase safety, and aid the nascent automobile tourism industry by providing places for motorists to relax, eat, and use restrooms in the years before rest areas and convenience stores became commonplace. The waysides were generally designed in the National Park Service Rustic style, which emphasized the use of natural materials that would harmonize with the local environment and also endure with minimal maintenance. Like most of Minnesota's early waysides, the Reads Landing Overlook was designed by landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols in consultation with MHD engineer Harold E. Olson. Nichols drew up his plans in August 1939 and they were approved with some revisions the following month. His design were adapted to the uniquely narrow site, squeezed at the base of a bluff between the highway and a sharp dropoff to railroad tracks and the lakeshore. As a consequence it resembles interpretive waysides like the Craigie Flour Mill Historical Marker rather than broad overlooks like the Garrison Concourse and Stillwater Overlook. Dolomite from the area was cut and laid with great attention to craftsmanship. Decorative accents were built with an orange/pink brick selected to contrast with the tan stone. The symmetrical plan and fine brick detailing exemplify the sophisticated formalism with which Nichols frequently imbued his rustic style designs. Labor was provided through the National Youth Administration (NYA), a New Deal agency organized to provide employment and developmental opportunities for younger workers age 16 to 25. About 184,500 Minnesotans participated in the NYA from 1935 to 1943, building parks, playgrounds, highways, and public buildings. NYA labor produced at least 19 highway waysides for the Roadside Development Division in Minnesota, as well as picnic tables installed at many more sites. The Reads Landing Overlook was one of five wayside rests built by the Roadside Development Division along Route 61 near Lake Pepin, four of which are still extant. Only three other areas of the state received similar concentrations of waysides in this era: the North Shore, Mille Lacs Lake, and around Stillwater. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Wabasha County, Minnesota ==References Category:1940 establishments in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1940 Category:Buildings and structures in Wabasha County, Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wabasha County, Minnesota Category:New Deal in Minnesota Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Roadside parks Category:National Park Service rustic in Minnesota ","title":"Reads Landing Overlook"},{"id":"56559905","text":"Laila Friis-Salling (born April 11, 1985) is a freestyle skier from Greenland.

The full concept of \\"net neutrality\\" was developed by regulators and legal academics, most prominently law professors Tim Wu, Lawrence Lessig and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell often while speaking at the University of Colorado School of Law Annual Digital Broadband Migration conference or writing in the Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law.Videos from the Digital Broadband Migration conference and papers from the Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law about Net Neutrality law are collected at http://neutralitylaw.com By late 2005, several Congressional draft bills contained net neutrality regulations, as a part of ongoing proposals to reform the Telecommunications Act of 1996, requiring Internet providers to allow consumers access to any application, content, or service. However, important exceptions have permitted providers to discriminate for security purposes, or to offer specialized services like \\"broadband video\\" service.https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/2982 In April 2006, a large coalition of public interest, consumer rights and free speech advocacy groups and thousands of bloggers—such as Free Press, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, American Library Association, Christian Coalition of America, Consumers Union, Common Cause and MoveOn.org—launched the SavetheInternet.com Coalition, a broad-based initiative working to \\"ensure that Congress passes no telecommunications legislation without meaningful and enforceable network neutrality protections.\\" Within two months of its establishment, it delivered over 1,000,000 signatures to Congress in favor of net neutrality policies and by the end of 2006, it had collected more than 1.5 million signatures. Two proposed versions of \\"neutrality\\" legislation were to prohibit: (1) the \\"tiering\\" of broadband through sale of voice- or video- oriented \\"Quality of Service\\" packages; and (2) content- or service-sensitive blocking or censorship on the part of broadband carriers. These bills were sponsored by Representatives Markey, Sensenbrenner, et al., and Senators Snowe, Dorgan, and Wyden. In 2006 Congressman Adam Schiff (D-California), one of the Democrats who voted for the 2006 Sensenbrenner-Conyers bill, said: \\"I think the bill is a blunt instrument, and yet I think it does send a message that it's important to attain jurisdiction for the Justice Department and for antitrust issues.\\" The following legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress to address the net neutrality question: { style=\\"width:100%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\\" - !

They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.

Saranankara.Sunday Observer. Buddhist Monks Heroes of Sri Lanka’s Freedom Struggles Pieter Keuneman served as CTUF president for some time. Soon after its foundation, CTUF ordered its affiliates to reorganise from company unions to unions by industrial sector. CTUF led a major strike amongst harbour workers in July 1941. Nevertheless, during the remainder of the Second World War, the party adopted a line of avoiding confrontations as a way to support the 'anti-fascist' war effort. As of 1944 CTUF represented eleven unions with a combined membership of 18,000. After the formation of the Communist Party in 1943, CTUF remained closely tied to the new party. CTUF joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945. On September 15, 1945 CTUF organized a mass rally to the State Council to demand solution to unemployment problem. As the government refused to hear the demands of the protestors, CTUF organized a token half-day strike, mobilizing some 8,000 workers, followed by a six-day strike of some 30,000 workers. The strike was settled after the Mayor of Colombo intervened. In April 1958 a strike action of CTUF, the Ceylon Mercantile Union and the Ceylon Federation of Labour resulted in violence between striking workers and police. In 1962 CTUF reached its peak strength, organizing almost 80,000 members. As of 1963 CTUF organized 31 unions with 68,130 members. In the internal split in the Communist Party in 1963, CTUF was seized by the Peking Wing faction. At the time of the split N. Shanmugathasan was the general secretary of CTUF, and A.D.

To All Marxist-Leninists Inside the Ceylon Communist Party Following the split in the Communist Party, Watson Fernando became president of CTUF whilst N. Shanmugathasan remained as general secretary. In response to the Communist Party (Peking Wing) taking control of CTUF, the Communist Party (Moscow Wing) set up the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU). After the 1971 JVP insurrection, the Communist Party (Peking Wing) was targeted by government repression. Many leaders of the party were arrested. CTUF was temporarily disbanded. By 1974 CTUF had become practically defunct. Most CTUF leaders joined CFTU instead, some joined other groups. ==References== Category:Trade unions in Sri Lanka Category:1940 establishments in Ceylon ","title":"Ceylon Trade Union Federation"},{"id":"56560209","text":"Shauna A.

She was also active in the arts and crafts movement in the United States for her wood engravings. Birds and insects: Dialogues in prose and verse, illustrative of their habits and instinct ==Biography== Jane Bragg was born in Birmingham, England in 1825. She was the second daughter of a family with four sisters, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, Caroline and Maria and five brothers, Thomas, John, William, Joseph and Robert Bragg. She received an education at a private school in England and soon became a tutor for the institution. In 1844, Bragg was accredited with writing the children's book Birds and insects: Dialogues in prose and verse, illustrative of their habits and instinct.

The couple had their first son, Arnold, in 1851 and their second son, Ellis, in 1853. While pregnant with her third child, Elis, the Pitman family moved to the United States in January 1853. They moved to the United States due to the influence of Benjamin Pitman's brother, Isaac, who wanted to establish and spread phonographic shorthand before it was popularized. Soon after the move, while transitioning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jane gave birth to her second son, Ellis. Both Ellis and Arnold died during their brief stay in Pennsylvania. By 1855, the Pitman's settled in Cincinnati, Ohio where her husband established the Cincinnati Phonographic Institute. In Cincinnati, Bragg learned the publication of phonographic and phonetic works, engraving and type setting, and typography. She revised the final proofs of D.S Smalley's \\"American Phonetic Dictionary of English Language\\" published in 1855.

Bragg fell ill 1877, and was an invalid for the last year of her life. She died on February 11, 1878 in their residence in Hillside, Ohio at 52 years old. In accordance with her wishes her body was cremated at the recently opened crematorium in Washington, Pennsylvania, the first of its kind. She thus became the first woman to be cremated in the United States. ==Wood engravings== Like her daughter, Agnes Pitman, and husband, Benn Pitman, Jane Bragg began wood carving. In 1872, Jane and her daughter, Agnes, carved several pieces of furniture, doors, and other architectural woodwork which was submitted to the Third Annual Cincinnati Industrial Exhibition. In 1876, Pitman carved a chest of drawers embellished with carved floral motifs representing the months of April through September which was shown in the Cincinnati Room of the Women's Pavilion at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. ==Wildlife motif== Throughout Bragg's artistic creations, such as her children's book Birds and insects: Dialogues in prose and verse, illustrative of their habits and instinct. In her wood carvings, wildlife is a common motif. Birds were carved into her book along with the mantle over the fireplace in her home. Bragg was known to love gardening and had botanical knowledge of the plants and flowers she cared for. ==References* Category:19th-century English writers Category:19th-century English women Category:Stenographers Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:1825 births Category:1877 deaths Category:Writers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English wood engravers Category:Typesetters ","title":"Jane Bragg Pitman"},{"id":"56560281","text":"Roger Wilson Cutler (November 3, 1889–November 30, 1963) was an American athlete and naval officer who served in World War I and World War II. ==Early life== Cutler was born on November 3, 1889 in Brookline, Massachusetts.

According to folklore, her fort, Allirani fort, is located in Mannar, Sri Lanka. She is sometimes seen as an incarnation or multiform of Meenakshi and Kannagi. Legends attribute her as an \\"Amazon\\" ruler, who had an administrative and an army of only women, with male being their subordinates and servants. There are references to her in several texts such as Alli katai, Alli Arasani Maalai, Pavazhakodi Maalai and Pulavendran Kalava Maalai. She is also depicted in a popular dramatic compilation in Tamil language, entitled as Alli Arasani Nadakam. == Legend == The only daughter of a Pandyan king, she was considered an immaculate conception as she was found on an alli (Tamil word for lily) after the end of a Putrakameshti ritual. She was at young age sent to gurukula and perfected riding and martial arts. Alli Raani is described as beautiful, courages and alert. She defeated and killed in a battle an usurper to the Pandyan throne named Neenmugan, \\"The blue faced one\\", who came at her with an army. After the victory was she crowned to the throne of Madurai. Several myths attribute her as being married to the Mahabharata hero Arjuna. Arjuna who penetrated the palace of Alli Raani, took the form of an old ascetic man. He called out for the love of the queen, who responded back by sending snakes and elephants to kill him. Arjuna later on came to her room in the form of a snake as she was asleep, thereupon embracing the queen. According to other versions of this myth is this event followed by a marriage with Arjuna tying the Thaali on Alli Raani. Alli Raani ruled over the in western and northern coasts of Sri Lanka and controlled there the pearl fishery. According to local traditions did the gulf of Arasadi have no opening towards the north, but communicated with the sea by a channel running in the line of the present Chilaw canal. Alli Raani used to proceed from Kudiramalai to Akkaraipattu by land. A great flood submerged greater parts of land, subsequently leaving Arasadi on a narrow split of land, forming the present Puttalam Lagoon and destroying her palace. == See also == * Kannagi * Tamil mythology == References == Category:Tamil monarchs Category:Mythological queens Category:Sri Lankan Hindus Category:Sri Lankan Tamil royalty ","title":"Alli Raani"},{"id":"56560311","text":"Ceraturgus elizabethae is a species of robber flies in the family Asilidae. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:Asilidae Category:Insects described in 1924 ","title":"Ceraturgus elizabethae"},{"id":"56560335","text":"\\"Anathema\\" may refer to: * The song by Twenty One Pilots from Regional at Best. * The song by Anathema from the album Distant Satellites.

The Antonov An-24 had suffered an engine failure on takeoff and was attempting to return to the airport when it struck an oil rig cable at low altitude resulting in a crash. At the time, it was the second worst accident involving the An-24 and remains the worst aviation accident in Azerbaijani history. == Aircraft == The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-24B registered CCCP-46435 to Aeroflot. The Antonov An-24 is a twin engine medium haul transport/passenger aircraft that was introduced in 1962. The 'B' variant of the model increased passenger capacity and modified the flaps to increase performance. CCCP-46435 entered service in 1968 and was operating under the Azerbaijan Civil Aviation Administration. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained 7,374 flight hours and 5,502 pressurization cycles. == Crew == The crew consisted of: * Captain: Nikolai Panchenko * Co-pilot: Valentin Viktorovich Konokotin * Flight engineer: Anatoly Vasilyevich Zharov == Synopsis == At 18:36 MSK on 18 August 1973, CCCP-46435 took off from Baku-Bina International Airport for an approximately 300 mile (480 km) flight to the Kazakh town of Fort-Shevchenko. Weather at the time was fair with ten kilometers of visibility, and wind coming from the north. On board were sixty passengers, including eleven children, and four crew who were on their second flight of the day. Just 30 feet (10 m) above the runway, the An-24 suffered an uncontained failure of the left engine. At 90 feet (30 m) the crew retracted the flaps and began turning left at an altitude of 120 feet (40 m). As it turned, the left wingtip struck the cable of an oil rig in the Caspian Sea, shearing it off. The plane descended, striking a pipeline, before crashing near a highway at 18:51 MSK. 54 people on board were killed and eight others seriously injured including the flight's captain and flight engineer. == Conclusions == An investigation of the crash blamed the engine failure on the degradation of the turbine blades in the engine as a result of continuous overheating. This overheating can stem from several causes including not following the correct start-up procedures, design flaws, and the inability to detect overheating by visual means or through instrument indications. The plane was also overloaded beyond its weight capacity by 193 kilograms (425 lbs). == See also == * Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 217 * Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 56 * Aeroflot Flight 3843 * Avensa Flight 358 == References == Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1973 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Azerbaijan Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by engine failure 0013 Category:1973 in the Soviet Union Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-24 Category:August 1973 events in Asia ","title":"Aeroflot Flight 13"},{"id":"56560396","text":"Anne Wright (1793 – 18 January 1861) was a British author, most notably of children's books about natural sciences.

Writing  Title page of The Observing Eye Anne Wright's most well-known work during her time was The Observing Eye. It received great critical acclaim, a geologist, Hugh Miller, saying \\"[The Observing Eye] is quite a model of the way in which the study of living nature ought to be brought before the minds of children.\\" In fact, this work was chosen by Queen Victoria to be in the collection that was to be read by the royal children. Wright herself took an interest in geology, sometimes gathering and studying different specimens. Several of her works involved the geology and other natural sciences: * Our World: Its Rocks and Fossils (1859) * The Globe Prepared for Man: A Guide to Geology (1853) * What is a Bird?

The unit operated on the frontier, but proving itself to be lacking in discipline, and being very costly, it was disbanded and replaced by a dragoon regiment in 1833. ==Formation== At the time of the formation of the Mounted Rangers, the United States Army lacked cavalry due to downsizing of the army after the War of 1812. The opening of the Santa Fe Trail led to demands for military escorts of the annual trading caravans across the prairies. In 1829 four infantry companies from Fort Leavenworth were ordered to protect that year's caravan. This expedition demonstrated the inferiority of foot soldiers against mounted Comanches. At the end of 1831, Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri put forward a bill authorizing President Jackson to organize a mounted ranger unit of volunteers for frontier defense. The outbreak of the Black Hawk War meant that the bill was promptly passed by both houses of the Congress.Urwin 2003, pp. 50-54. The decision to organize a volunteer battalion instead of a regular cavalry regiment, emanated from the prevalent attitudes of the ruling Democratic Party toward the United States Army. The Regular Army was seen as a stronghold of aristocratic West Pointers in contrast with the virtuous citizen soldiers of the militia.Wetterman 2009, p. 62. ==Organization== The Mounted Rangers were organized into six companies, each with a captain, a first lieutenant, a second lieutenant, a third lieutenant, five sergeants, five corporals, and 100 private rangers.Peters 1846, vol. 4, p. 533. Henry Dodge was made a major and the commander; captains were Lemuel Ford, Benjamin V. Becks, Jesse B. Brown, Jesse Bean, Nathan Boone, and Matthew Duncan.Annals of Iowa 1873, p. 227. The officers and NCOs were appointed directly from civilian life. The private rangers were hardened hunters, trappers, and other outdoorsmen, who were used to a rugged life. They enlisted for one year only, and had to supply their own mounts, horse tack, weapons, equipment, and clothing, and pay for their horses' forage. As compensation they received one dollar a day in addition to their pay.Steffen 1977, p. 85. ==Assignments== Three companies were stationed at Fort Armstrong, Illinois, in the aftermath of the Black Hawk War. The three other companies were stationed at Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. Their mission was to support the Indian agents and negotiators under Henry Ellsworth that tried to mediate between the native population there and the members of the Five Civilized Tribes that had been removed beyond the Mississippi. One of the Fort Gibson companies were later moved to Fort Leavenworth, to fulfill the mounted rangers' intended mission of escorting caravans on the Santa Fe Trail.Young 1954, pp. 457-458. ==Disbandment== The Mounted Rangers were disbanded when the one-year enlistment period ended. The rangers had revealed themselves as lacking in discipline, and their leather hunting shirts had become so soiled that citizens and Indians could not separate them from common militia. When the Secretary of War, Lewis Cass, demonstrated that the battalion was more costly than a regular regiment of dragoons, the fate of the Mounted Rangers was sealed. The Congress decided to replace them with the \\"United States Regiment of Dragoons\\"; the commanding officer of the Mounted Rangers, Major Henry Dodge, becoming its colonel and first commander.Urwin 2003, sid. 54.

The painting depicts a scene in which the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan stares upon the Taj Mahal on his deathbed, with his daughter at his feet. Initially involved with the dominant style of European Naturalism, Tagore's mentor Ernest Binfield Havell had introduced him to various types of Indian art. Of these varieties, Tagore was most impressed with old Mughal miniatures, which often featured emotionless, but detailed illustrations of scenes and characters. Incorporating this style with the traditional Indian artistic concept of Bhava', or emotion, Tagore had painted a scene based upon the growing re-interest in Indian history during the British Raj. The painting had helped to establish Tagore as one of the most well known Indian artists of his time. In addition to creating a whole new movement of Indian style painting, Tagore later on went to paint more artwork depicting nationalist and swadeshi themes during the time of the Indian independence movement. ==Background== Abanindranath Tagore was born in August 7, 1871 to Gunendranath Tagore. A nephew of the Indian poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore, Abanindranath was exposed at an early age to the artistic inclinations of the Tagore family. Tagore had been exposed to learning art when he first studied at the Sanskrit College in Kolkata in the 1880s. In his early years, Tagore had painted in the European naturalistic style, evident from his early paintings such as The Armoury. In about 1886 or 1887, Tagore's relative Gyanadanandini Devi had set up a meeting between Tagore and E.B Havell, who was the curator of the Government school of Art in Calcutta. The meeting resulted in a series of exchanges between Havell and Tagore, with Havell gaining a native art collaborator with ideas in the same direction of his own, and Tagore gaining a teacher who would teach him about the 'science' of Indian art history. Havell attempted to induct Tagore as the Vice Principal of the art school, which was faced with heavy opposition in the school. Havell had to bend much of the school rules to do this, and tolerated many of Tagore's habits including the smoking of hookah in the classrooms and refusing to stick to time schedules. Havell introduced innovations to his teaching program in an attempt to more accurately reproduce Indian art pedagogy, and replaced European copies of art with Indian originals. The English art curator had also reportedly spent many hours behind closed doors explaining the details of \\"Hindu art and sculpture\\" to Tagore. One of these paintings, of a stork by a Mughal-era artist, had been shown to Tagore by Havell, causing the former to remark that he was unaware until then of the \\"embarassment[sic?] of riches\\" that \\"our art\\" had contained. ==Subject== The Passing of Shah Jahan depicts a scene with the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who had commissioned in his lifetime the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal. The architectural facade which frames the painting clearly represents a painstaking replication of marble inlay work decoration and complex railing patterns. The painting's attention is concentrated upon two main figures: the dying Shah Jahan and his daughter at the end of his bed, while the Mughal emperor's gaze is drawn to a small depiction of the Taj Mahal in the upper corner. ==Themes and Composition== A portrait of Abanindranath Tagore. After the success of The Passing of Shah Jahan, Tagore had received widespread acclaim and worked on more paintings incorporating Indian themes. Earlier renderings of the subject in literature had focused on Mughal wars of succession, and depicted Shah Jahan as an aging king who's illness and weakness had been the cause of instability and war. Locked in his room in the Red Fort by his son Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan was seen as a 'poor palace builder' whose only achievement was his monument to love: the Taj Mahal. Many British colonial authorities had went further and sought to differentiate between the current regime and that of the Mughals, in order to demonstrate the lasting vitality of the British colonial Empire. Tagore's painting fits this description due to the widely available Colonial literature and attitude of the day. E.B Havell's interest in monuments and sculpture never found a place with Tagore. What had attracted him the most was the intimacy of relationship found in Indian art which was further exemplified by the selective realism in Mughal miniatures. Realism not in terms of surfaces, but rather of expressions. The three major types of painting that were to have inspired Tagore were British watercolor painting, Mughal miniatures, and Japanese painting. The incorporation of these styles is evident in The Passing of Shah Jahan. Tagore moved from a normative realism used as a tool for objective expression, into a freer naturalism that would draw attention to specific areas through realism. Tagore's works typically have no anonymity in form, and themes of individualism are almost always present; this has met with some criticism amongst art critiques. In addition, Tagore sought to incorporate Bhava, or feeling, into his artwork. This idea of 'feeling' was especially important to the 'Passing of Shah Jahan'; the painting had attempted to explain the romantic ideas of loss, focusing on Shah Jahan's imprisonment at the Red Fort and the loss of his wife. Prior to Tagore, this idea was never visualized, though many Mughal and Western artists had drew many portraits and figures of Shah Jahan and other Mughal characters. However, neither group had attempted to illustrate the emotions of these characters nor did they contain narrative elements. Tagore's attempt to depict the pathos of Shah Jahan imprisoned in the Red Fort and his last look at the Taj Mahal was a revolutionary element in Indian painting, especially at a time when the study of Indian history gained attention by British colonialists and native Indian people. ==After completion== The Passing of Shah Jahan won several awards. It was first exhibited at the Delhi Durbar Exhibition of Arts and Crafts (1902-1903), where it had won a silver medal. The painting was next exhibited at the Congress Industrial Exhibition (1903) where it had won a Gold medal. After Tagore had received public recognition for his works, many other artists had begun to incorporate the same themes and techniques. Abanindranath Tagore was eventually known to be one of the most well known Indian artists of his time, both in and outside of Bengal, due to the nationalist works during the swadeshi years. Tagore went on to become a founder of the new school of Indian-style painting, though this became a role he had increasingly distanced himself from during his later years. == References == Category:Miniature painting Category:Indian paintings Category:1902 paintings ","title":"The Passing of Shah Jahan"},{"id":"56560668","text":"Stenelmis moapa, the moapa warm springs riffle beetle, is a species of riffle beetle in the family Elmidae.

He became king after disposing Kalachuri Rajput of Garha-Mandla, where earlier he worked in court. The Garha-Mandla kingdom was earlier a small territory which witnessed rapid expansion under the rule of Sangram Shah, the 48th king, He captured territories like Narmada Valley, Bhopal, Sagar, Damoh and most of the Satpura hills. However the Garha-Mandla kings' rule ended when Asaf Khan I, the Mughal Viceroy, invaded the kingdom in 1564. The Gond Queen Rani Durgavati is said to have fought bravely against King Akbar to save her kingdom; The Mughals acquired immense booty, including thousands of elephants from this victory. At the beginning of the year 1742 the Peshwas invaded Mandla and extracted chauth (tribute) from the region. Finally, with the end of Rajgond dynasty, Garha-Mandla was annexed to the Maratha government in the year 1781. The greatest ruler was Sangram Shah. He was 48th ruler of Garha Kingdom who had conquered 52 forts called Garh to strengthen and spread the Gond Empire. The Chouragrh Fort in Narsinghpur was built on the honour of conquering 52 forts. Sangram Shah is best known as a patron of arts and literature and he had great knowledge of Sanskrit. Rasratnamala was written by Sangram Shah. At the time of Sangram Shah the capital of Garha kingdom was Singhorgarh. His son Dalpat Shah was married to Rani Durgawati\\"Rani Durgavati: The Warrior Queen of the Gonds\\" who was a Chandel princess. Rani Durgavati moved her capital to Chouragarh because it was safer than Singhorgarh. Rani Durgawati is the known for the bravery and sacrifice for her country. She battled against Mughal Empire of Akbar lead by Asaf Khan in 1564. Hridayshah was the music lover. He was 54th ruler of Garha Kingdom. He gave his contributions for music. Hriday koutuk and Hriday prakash were written by him. He moved his capital from Chouragarh to Ramnagar of Mandla district. Shankar Shah and Raghunath Shah were freedom fighters who revolted against the British in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. ==Administration== Administration of Gondwana was becoming centralised.

The farmer, Gerald Stanley, stood trial for second- degree murder and for a lesser charge of manslaughter. Stanley was acquitted.https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/gerald-stanley-trial- jury-delivers-not-guilty-verdict-in-murder-of-colten-boushie Boushie was a resident of the Cree Red Pheasant First Nation. After getting a flat tire, he and four friends had driven to a farmhouse near Biggar, Saskatchewan, owned by Gerald Stanley. They had been drinking and had earlier tried to break into a truck at another farm. One of the group tried to start an ATV on the property and their SUV crashed into one of Stanley’s cars. Stanley reacted by retrieving a handgun from his shed and firing two warning shots into the air to scare the group off his property. He then approached the SUV, with Boushie in the driver's seat. When he reached the driver's window, his gun discharged. Boushie was shot in the neck just below the ear and died instantly. Stanley's defence claimed the shot was an accident and that a third round loaded into the magazine was fired, yet failed to detonate, precipitating a hang fire. The circumstances of the shooting, the RCMP investigation, the trial, and the verdict are flashpoints of controversy in Canada. The case drew significant attention, sparking protests and provoking debates about racism in Saskatchewan and across Canada. People who supported Stanley generally perceived the trial as fair, given the circumstances of events leading up to the shooting. Supporters of the Boushie family felt the trial was unfair due to the selection of what appeared to be an all-white jury. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould denounced the verdict. Critics scorned these comments for politicizing the trial and discrediting the Canadian judiciary system. The mayor of Saskatoon, Charlie Clark, said the trial and its aftermath represented \\"a defining moment for this community and this country\\". ==Background== Colten Boushie (October 31, 1993 – August 9, 2016) was a resident of the Cree Red Pheasant First Nation of Saskatchewan. According to the police Information To Obtain warrant (ITO), which was produced in the early stages of the investigation and obtained by The Globe and Mail on August 9, 2016, 22-year-old Colten Boushie and his girlfriend Kiora Wuttunee, Belinda Jackson and her boyfriend Eric Meechance, and Cassidy Cross-Whitstone, all from the Red Pheasant First Nation, had spent the day swimming, drinking, and shooting at the Maymont River. Wuttunee's grey 2003 Ford Escape SUV got a flat tire. The ITO stated that Boushie's group first visited a neighbouring farm belonging to the Fouhy family, where they \\"attempted to steal vehicles and items\\" by trying to smash the window of a truck with a .22 calibre rifle. Cross-Whitstone broke the stock of the rifle in this failed attempt. They then drove on to Gerald Stanley's property near Biggar, Saskatchewan, in the Rural Municipality of Glenside No. 377, which is about from their home. When the SUV entered the Stanley property, Gerald Stanley and his son Sheldon were repairing a fence, while Stanley's wife Leesa was mowing the lawn not far away. The SUV's occupants first entered a truck belonging to one of Gerald's customers, then mounted an ATV.Hill, A. Gerald Stanley trial: Colten Boushie was asleep when vehicle arrived at farmyard, friend testifies January 31, 2018, Saskatchewan Starpheonix, Access date = April 2, 2018. Sheldon chased them away and smashed the SUV's windshield with a hammer. It \\"crashed into Stanley's wife's car and came to a halt\\".Hill, A. Gerald Stanley trial: 'Boom, the thing just went off', says Sask. farmer testifying in own defence Saskatoon Starpheonix, February 6, 2018, access date = April 2, 2018 Stanley took a semi-automatic handgun from his shed, loaded it and \\"fired warning shots in the air\\" as Cross-Whitstone and Meechance ran from the ATV and fled the property. Sheldon Stanley went into the house to get his truck keys. Gerald Stanley then approached the SUV with Boushie in the driver's seat and Jackson and Wuttunee in the back. Stanley would later testify he saw the lawnmower his wife was using and thought that she had been run over. He reached in with his left hand to turn off the ignition while holding his handgun in his right hand. The handgun then discharged and Boushie was shot in the \\"back of the head at point blank range\\" at about 5:30 pm. The RCMP later found a loaded .22-calibre rifle between his legs.Quenneville, G.What happened on Gerald Stanley's farm the day Colten Boushie was shot, as told by witnesses CBC News, Feb 06, 2018 3:45 PM CT Last Updated: February 12, Access date = April 2, 2018.Graveland, B., \\"Accused killer said gun 'just went off', son tells Colten Boushie murder trial\\" Star News, The Canadian Press, January 31, 2018, Access date = April 9, 2018 . ==Aftermath of the shooting== Boushie's supporters expressed frustration with the \\"flawed and inadequate\\" police inquiry, stating that it \\"initially focused more on the actions of the five young Indigenous people than on the killing of Mr. Boushie\\". The person initially in charge of the investigation was a junior constable; no forensic experts were brought in. The Ford Escape SUV in which Boushie was killed, was \\"left uncovered, its doors open, for two rainy days, washing away evidence\\". On August 10, 2016, a media release from the RCMP said, \\"A man was declared dead at the scene. Another man 'associated to the property' was arrested by police at the scene without incident. No charges were immediately laid. Three occupants of the vehicle—one woman, one girl and one man—were taken into custody as part of a related theft investigation, police said. Police later identified and located a fourth boy who was in the vehicle.\\" This release explained that the witnesses to Boushie's killing were taken into custody \\"as part of a related theft investigation\\". None of them were charged as the result of a plea deal in exchange for testimony. Ultimately their testimony was deemed inconclusive due to inconsistencies of their accounts. On August 12, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) representing 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, issued a media release expressing disappointment in the way the RCMP presented the shooting incident. The RCMP statement \\"provided just enough prejudicial information for the average reader to draw their own conclusions that the shooting was somehow justified. The messaging in an RCMP news release should not fuel racial tensions ... The media's initial portrayal of the event made the incident sound like a crime was about to be committed by the passengers in the car.\\" The FSIN called for a review of the RCMP's communication policies and writing guidelines. The FSIN said that the \\"RCMP news release was biased and not in line with the relationship the FSIN and the RCMP have been building with measures such as the RCMP FSIN Partnership Protocol\\". The FSIN blamed the RCMP's August 10 statement for \\"racially charged social media posts\\" that were posted on the Saskatchewan Farmers Group's Facebook pages with photos of \\"farmers carrying firearms\\". Updated November 12, 2017 The RCMP Superintendent held a press conference asking \\"residents to put their guns away\\". The Federation said that the RCMP media release \\"made it appear that Boushie's killing was justified\\" by the \\"right to defend\\" and that the way the RCMP shared information about the incident had fuelled racial tensions in Saskatchewan. On the same day, the RCMP responded to the August 12 FSIN statement. Three days after the shooting, on August 12, 2016, CBC News reported that the \\"event had stimulated a lot of discussion on various social media platforms\\". Paul Dornstauder, CBC's Executive Producer for Radio Current Affairs in Saskatchewan, described how \\"there was a vigorous and at times rancorous debate about what had happened and why, some of which was racist\\". The article was the subject of investigation by CBC's ombudsman, following CBC's receipt of 25 complaints from readers concerned that \\"it was wrong of CBC News to publish this article, that it fed into a racist argument about Indigenous peoples that saw Mr. Boushie as a menace. It was seen as an endorsement of the use of violence by some readers.\\" One complainant asserted that the article mistakenly linked \\"property rights\\" to Boushie's death. The complainant called the article \\"irresponsible and damaging\\" as it \\"could fan racist sentiment\\". The article has since been revised. Dornstauder described \\"this story as having had an electrifying effect in Saskatchewan\\". It is \\"complex and controversial\\", requiring sensitivity and \\"likely will continue to for some time to come\\". On August 15, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall called the comments \\"unacceptable, intolerant and a betrayal of the very values and character of Saskatchewan\\". He described them as \\"dangerous\\". More than five hundred comments representing both sides of the debate appeared on Wall's Facebook page in response to his remarks. By August 17, 2016, the National Farmers Union published a statement in which they expressed their \\"profound sadness over the tragic shooting of Colten Boushie\\", and extended \\"deepest condolences to his family and community\\" and \\"as farmers\\", condemned \\"the rampant racist remarks that have circulated since the death of Colten Boushie, including comments made on the 'Saskatchewan Farmers' Facebook group\\". Robert Innes, a University of Saskatchewan professor, described the \\"racial tension\\" in Saskatchewan as a \\"tinder box\\" with \\"some farmers\\" \\"blaming First Nations people for rural crime. Their mentality is to protect their property.\\" ==Bail hearing== Gerald Stanley's bail hearing was held in North Battleford on August 18, 2016. Hundreds of people protested outside the North Battleford courthouse with RCMP on rooftops observing. On August 19, Stanley was granted bail on a $10,000 cash surety. His bail included a number of conditions, including that he stay within of his home and that he have no contact with Boushie's family or any of the witnesses. ==Trial== The trial took place from January 30, 2018, to February 9, 2018, at the Court of Queen's Bench Saskatchewan in Battleford with Saskatchewan Chief Justice Martel D. Popescul presiding. The jury selection system allowed trial lawyers to use \\"peremptory challenges\\" to reject a limited number of potential jurors without giving a specific reason. Seven hundred and fifty people were randomly summoned based on health cards for potential jury duty from the Battleford Jury Boundary, a huge area that stretches to the north of Saskatchewan. The pool which was almost double the normal size was enlarged to help secure a more representative jury, though only 204 of the 750 individuals who were summoned actually showed up. Five who appeared to be First Nations were challenged by the defence, leaving what appeared to be an all-white jury. During the trial, Stanley's attorney Scott Spencer said there was \\"no evidence\\" that Stanley intentionally killed Boushie. By February 8, 2018, the jurors were deliberating on a verdict behind closed doors. Judge Popescul \\"warned people in the gallery about making comments during [the] tense trial\\" and said that \\"it was the first time in his long career that he had to say that in court based on a complaint from a juror\\". During Judge Popescul's charge to the jury, he instructed them: > You must not find Gerald Stanley guilty unless you are sure he is guilty. > Even if you believe that Mr. Stanley is probably guilty or likely guilty, > that is not sufficient. In those circumstances, you must give the benefit of > the doubt to Mr. Stanley and find him not guilty because the Crown has > failed to satisfy you of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. > If you have a reasonable doubt about Mr. Stanley's guilt arising from the > evidence, the absence of the evidence, or the credibility or the reliability > of one or more of the witnesses then you must find him not guilty. In short, > the presumption of innocence applies at the beginning and continues > throughout the trial, unless you are satisfied after considering the whole > of the evidence that the Crown has displaced the presumption of innocence by > proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \\"Hang fire\\" defence The defence case relied heavily on the assertion that the fatal shot was unintentional and the result of a hang fire. The casing from the fatal shot had an unusual bulge which testing of the gun could not reproduce. The gun used was a 1947 Tokarev T33 with surplus military ammunition from 1953. The ammunition had been stored in an unheated shed where the temperature varied between and . Experts concluded nevertheless that the gun was functioning properly and a misfire could not be replicated during testing. ==Verdict== Stanley was acquitted on February 9, 2018. Since Canadian jurors are legally barred from discussing the proceedings, it is not known how the jury reached its verdict or whether the jury accepted that the gunshot that killed Boushie was hang fire. ==Impact== The story attracted widespread attention from social media and mainstream media. Following the announcement of the acquittal, about 1,000 people, including the mayor of Saskatoon, Charlie Clark, gathered at a rally at the Saskatoon court house to show support for Boushie's family and to express frustration with the acquittal. Other rallies and vigils took place in Battleford, Winnipeg, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Toronto, and Ottawa to challenge the verdict. Clint Wuttunee, Chief of the Red Pheasant First Nation, called the verdict \\"absolutely perverse\\" and stated that \\"an all-white jury formed the twisted view of that obvious truth and found Stanley not guilty\\". In response to the verdict, Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations's Vice-chief David Pratt, challenged the jury selection system, saying that \\"defence counsel used peremptory challenges to block every potential juror who appeared to be Indigenous\\". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement on February 10, saying, \\"I am going to say we have come to this point as a country far too many times. Indigenous people across this country are angry, they're heartbroken and I know Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians alike know that we have to do better.\\" Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said he would be meeting with Trudeau and with First Nations leadership. Canadian Justice Minister and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould made a comment in a Tweet that Canada \\"can and must do better\\". Jagmeet Singh, a criminal defence lawyer and the Leader of the New Democratic Party, told reporters on February 13 that \\"justice was not served for Colten Boushie\\". Toronto-based criminal defence lawyer Sean Robichaud said that it was \\"wholly inappropriate for elected officials to publicly undermine findings of a lawfully delivered verdict, particularly when it is one of a jury\\". He cautioned that there could be ramifications. \\"By commenting on a particular case, it may affect the ability for Crown to proceed with the case if an appeal is granted.\\" Lisa Raitt, Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, Rob Nicholson, and other Conservatives also criticised comments by Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould. At a press conference hosted by Saskatoon Tribal Council, Mayor Clark described the \\"high-profile trial and its aftermath—which included rallies across Canada—represent a defining moment for this community and this country. A defining moment for our city, our province, our country, where we decide what kind of country we’re going to be.\\" The Saskatoon StarPhoenix reported that Clark called for a \\"prompt reckoning across the country\\" as the acquittal had sparked \\"anxiety and anger\\". Many chiefs across Saskatchewan, including northern communities, travelled to Saskatoon to attend the rally. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a statement to remind concerned parties to \\"conduct themselves in a peaceful and civil manner regardless of the outcome\\", warning that \\"people will be held responsible for what they say or post online and police will investigate any complaints of suspected criminal behaviour\\". On February 10, thousands attended rallies across Canada in a day-of-action activities to support Boushie's family. About 200 people gathered at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square to protest the verdict that day. On February 12, over 300 people gathered to march from Calgary City Hall to Reconciliation Bridge, in temperatures and wind chill that felt like , to show support for Colten Boushie's family. By February 11, Colten Boushie's mother Debbie Baptiste, his cousin Jade Tootoosis, and uncle Alvin had travelled to Ottawa from their remote community for potential meetings with Wilson-Raybould, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and other ministers, to advocate for justice. They called for \\"an end to peremptory challenges in jury selection, which were used in Mr. Stanley's trial to block every potential juror who appeared to be Indigenous\\". They are also challenging \\"a number of systemic problems in the justice system, as well as specific complaints arising from the way Mr. Boushie's death was investigated and prosecuted\\". Updated February 12 On February 28, the Justice for our Stolen Children Camp was set up on Wascana Park in Regina in response to the death of Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine. nîpawistamâsowin: We Will Stand Up, a documentary film by Tasha Hubbard about the Colten Boushie case, won the award for Best Canadian Feature Documentary at the 2019 Hot Docs Canadian International Film Festival,\\"‘We Will Stand Up,’ ‘Hope Frozen’ Take Top Prizes at Hot Docs\\".

Oellermann is a South African mathematician specializing in graph theory. She is a professor of mathematics at the University of Winnipeg. ==Education and career== Oellermann was born in Vryheid. She earned a bachelor's degree, cum laude honours, and a master's degree at the University of Natal in 1981, 1982, and 1983 respectively, as a student of Henda Swart. She completed her Ph.D. in 1986 at Western Michigan University. Her dissertation was Generalized Connectivity in Graphs and was supervised by Gary Chartrand. Oellermann taught at the University of Durban-Westville, Western Michigan University, University of Natal, and Brandon University, before moving to Winnipeg in 1996. At Winnipeg, she was co-chair of mathematics and statistics for 2011–2013. ==Contributions== With Gary Chartrand, Oellermann is the author of the book Applied and Algorithmic Graph Theory (McGraw Hill, 1993). She is also the author of well-cited research publications on metric dimension of graphs, on distance-based notions of convex hulls in graphs, and on highly irregular graphs in which every vertex has a neighborhood in which all degrees are distinct.

In 2017, the OHC conducted a series of 14 public hearings across the province in order to gather personal testimony regarding hospital care. Earlier in the year, the organization conducted a cross-province tour against for-profit medical clinics conducting MRIs and other diagnostic tests as well as cataract and other minor surgical procedures, claiming that this is a form of privatization that undermines the public health care system.

As a child she often read science fiction and mystery novels borrowed from her brother and mother, and her mother bought her a word processor after she attempted to write a novel by hand in the fourth grade of elementary school. After Murata completed middle school in Inzai, her family moved to Tokyo, where she graduated from Kashiwa High School (attached to Nishogakusha University) and attended Tamagawa University. Kashiwa High School Her first novel, Jyunyū (Breastfeeding), won the 2003 Gunzo Prize for New Writers.

Many of the themes and character backstories in her writing come from her daily observations as a part-time convenience store worker. Societal acceptance of sexlessness in various forms, including asexuality, voluntary and involuntary celibacy, especially within marriage, recurs as a theme in several of her works, such as the novels Shōmetsu sekai (Dwindling World) and Konbini ningen (Convenience Store Person), and the short story \\"A Clean Marriage.\\" Murata is also known for her frank depictions of adolescent sexuality in work such as Gin iro no uta (Silver Song) and Shiro- iro no machi no, sono hone no taion no (Of Bones, of Body Heat, of Whitening City).

Returning from winter rest the Nick Savva trained greyhound lost to Fear Me, in the final of the BGRB Scottish Derby before creating his own piece of history. Westmead Hawk suffered a serious injury later in the year which resulted in him missing the 2006 Irish Greyhound Derby, an event that was won by Razldazl Billy trained by Dolores Ruth. Westmead Hawk was duly voted the Greyhound of the Year. Charlie Lister was Greyhound Trainer of the Year. Tracks Rye House Stadium, built in 1935, closed for good on the 15 November, just two years after re-opening. Competitions The battle between the countries two top staying (longer distance) greyhounds continued; Greenacre Lin defeated Roxholme Girl in the Golden Jacket final and then Roxholme Girl gained revenge by winning the William Hill TV Trophy. Greenacre Lin won the Cesarewitch and then Roxholme Girl headed for Manchester and claimed victory in the Gold Collar. They both bypassed the Grand Prix which was won by January Tiger trained by Mark Wallis, who had five of the finalists. Greenacre Lin was retired form racing in September and was voted stayer of the year. News GRA track Wimbledon lost four trainers during the course of the year. Seamus Cahill and Paul Garland both moved to Walthamstow Stadium followed by Ray Peacock and John Walsh leaving for Romford and Harlow respectively. Two replacements were Jason Foster from Oxford and Paul Donovan from Reading Stadium. Walthamstow also appointed new trainers in Peter Rich and Kelly Mullins (son of Linda Mullins). Coincidentally earlier in the year Kelly's brother John Mullins had left Walthamstow to concentrate solely on operating an open-race kennel at Capel St. Mary. Oxford's leading trainer Nick Colton joined sister track Hall Green. An article by the News of the World on the use of cocaine in society also suggests its use is rife in greyhound racing. The National Greyhound Racing Club responds with evidence that in over 70,000 samples taken during the year only four returned positive for cocaine (three of which were from human contamination) leaving just one case.

Rosen first became acting Mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, in 1974 following the death of his predecessor, Mayor Chuck Hall, who died in office. Rosen ultimately served as Mayor from 1974–1977, and is credited with beginning the revitalization of Miami Beach, notably by abolishing rent control in 1976, a move that was highly controversial at the time. ==Biography== Early life Rosen was born to Joseph and Roslyn Rosen on December 30, 1925, in Watertown, New York. He was raised in Watertown and nearby Carthage, New York. Rosen received his bachelor's degree from St. Lawrence University in New York. He enlisted in the United States Navy and served in both World War II and the Korean War. Career Rosen moved to Miami Beach in 1948 and enrolled at University of Miami School of Law in nearby Coral Gables, where obtained his law degree in 1952. He became licensed to practice law in Florida on April 14, 1952. His specialties included governmental and administrative law, as well as commercial and construction litigation. By the early 1970s, Harold Rosen had become an influential figure in Miami Beach due to his roles as a lawyer and city commissioner. Rosen had risen to the office of vice-mayor of Miami Beach by 1974, when incumbent Mayor Chuck Hall died in office, leaving an unexpected vacancy for the city's chief executive. In response to Hall's death, city commissioners had to choose a successor and became deadlocked. Rosen, the vice-mayor who was not believed to have aspirations to become mayor prior in 1974, volunteered for the position. In 2011 interview with Florida International University, Rosen recalled the moment saying, \\"So I said to these guys, I'm gonna be the mayor, I’ll take the job...who's gonna vote against me? And I became the mayor.\\" He went on to serve as Mayor from 1974 until 1977 (including a full two-year term from 1975 to 1977). Rosen inherited a city facing a number of pressing issues during the 1970s, including urban decay, poverty, a large elderly population, and rent control. During his mayoral tenure, Rosen is credited with beginning the transformation from a declining city into the world-known destination that Miami Beach is known for today. According to Seth Bramson, a history professor at Barry University, \\"Harold Rosen started the renaissance...He brought a great sense of optimism to Miami Beach.\\" One of Rosen's most controversial - and applauded - proposals was to eliminate rent control, a policy meant to protect Miami Beach's elderly residents, but also imposed price ceilings on landlords and property owners. Rosen originally proposed the abolition of rent control in 1970 while he was still a city commissioner. The response was swift and negative from residents. Rosen recalled that \\"all the old people\\" were angry at the idea and worried about potential rent increases. Rosen did not care at the time, later saying, \\"The commissioners at that time... they didn't want to go against the vote [for future elections]. I couldn’t care less because I didn’t wanna go any higher beyond the city commission. So it never bothered me.\\" Rosen once again proposed the idea to eliminate rent control once he became mayor. This time, Rosen managed to find the commissioner votes needed to abolish the rent regulation. Miami Beach city commissioners narrowly voted to eliminate rent control in a 4-3 vote in 1976 in a victory for Rosen. However, the move proved highly controversial. Still, in 1977 the Florida Legislature also voted to eliminate rent controls in the state. A number of pro-rent control lawsuits followed, but these ordinances were largely struck down by a series of court rulings during the 1980s. Rosen presided over an urban renewal project during the 1970s in an area south of Sixth Street which proved less successful. In 1973, the city government had passed a moratorium on so-called \\"unplanned development\\" in the neighborhood, which was home to some of Miami Beach's oldest buildings. This led to the property values of apartment buildings and hotels to stagnate or decline, which led to some of the structures falling into disrepair. The city, under Rosen, then sought to demolish more 372 structures in the neighborhood, which required Florida state approval that the neighborhood be declared blighted. The city commission ultimately declared the area blighted and in decay, despite opposition from then-State's Attorney for Dade County Janet Reno and Miami Beach residents. Years later, Rosen regretted the blight designation and demolitions, telling the Miami Herald, \\"It wasn't that blighted. That was just a word we had to use. Some parts of it were bad, but the majority was good. I think we just wanted to change the image. It was becoming a lot of small co-ops for the elderly and we didn’t want a retirement community for the elderly...Regrettably, there’s been a tremendous price.\\" In addition to his work as an attorney, Rosen was also a registered lobbyist. He helped a construction firm secure a $200 million in public right-of-way project contract in 2001, which was the largest public contract in Miami Beach's history at the time. By the mid-2010s, Rosen was serving as an attorney for the City of Miami Beach Visitors and Convention Authority. Harold Rosen died on January 16, 2018, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife of forty- two years, Judie Rosen; sister, Fay Friedland; two children; ten grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His funeral was held at Temple Emanu- El in Miami Beach on January 19, 2018. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Mayors of Miami Beach, Florida Category:Florida lawyers Category:Florida city council members Category:University of Miami School of Law alumni Category:St. Lawrence University alumni Category:Jewish American attorneys Category:Jewish mayors of places in the United States Category:Politicians from Watertown, New York Category:People from Carthage, New York Category:Jewish American people in Florida politics ","title":"Harold Rosen (mayor)"},{"id":"56561974","text":"James Francis Dunn (1874–1921) was an American architect who designed many buildings in San Francisco, California. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Architects from San Francisco ","title":"James Francis Dunn"},{"id":"56562025","text":"Ronald Charles MacKeith FRCP (23 February 1908 – 30 October 1977) was a British paediatrician. MacKeith was prolific in his endeavours. He was principally known for establishing the first cerebral palsy advice clinic, which was to become in 1964, the larger and more comprehensive Newcomen Centre for handicapped children in Guy's Hospital. He founded the British Paediatric Neurology Association and the medical journal, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology. His work gained recognition of the field of paediatric neurology as a science in several European countries. ==Life== MacKeith came from a very large family, who along with his twin sister, was third to last, in a family of 11 children. His childhood was seemingly serendipitous, having a father who was the GP Alexander Arthur MacKeith, and his mother, Alice, who was the daughter of a Pharmaceutical manufacturer. He started his studies at King Edward VI School, Southampton, subsequently moving to The Queen's College, Oxford in 1926, receiving a Bachelor of Arts and then a Master of Arts by 1930. He was then offered a position to start his clinical studies at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in 1932. MacKeith was offered a position as house officer at St Mary's. After working for a year, as a house officer, he spent the next year abroad as a Radcliffe travelling fellow. During that period he worked at the pediatric department of Bellevue Hospital, New York. During the interwar period, he held a number of junior positions, before finally being employed with Hector Charles Cameron at St James' Hospital, Balham towards the start of World War II. He spent the beginning of the war at St James, working through The Blitz, as Balham and indeed Wandsworth was being bombed extensively by Germany. In 1942 MacKeith decided to join up and from 1942 to 1945 was placed Royal Navy to work as a medical officer. He left at the end of the war with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander. After the war, he worked at Great Ormond Street Hospital as a supernumerary registrar, MacKeith was assigned a problem in paediatrics, by his consultant, Sir Alan Moncrieff. Moncrieff was looking for research to be conducted, on a previously researched problem of some importance, threadworn infestations in children. Although most failed to solve the problem, Moncrieff managed to, determining the epidemiology of threadworms and formulating a diagnosis, that is still valid today. He later conducted trials with the drug piperazine to determine its efficacy. He later moved to Guy's hospital, where two of his brothers were trained. In 1958 he was appointed Children's Physician several days before the start of the National Health Service. It was Guys where MacKeith's enduring notability was established, when he persuaded the hospital to permit parental visiting every day, instead of the usual habit of twice per week. This became established practice in the United Kingdom and abroad. He established the first cerebral palsy advice clinic, which was to become in 1964, the larger and more comprehensive Newcomen Centre for handicapped children in Guy's Hospital, becoming its first director, and later being joined by Mary Sheridan. The unit was established is a disused Victorian pub, located just outside the back gate. Access was by a steep winding stair, in which disabled children were carried, or occasionally climbed with dogged determination, which never curbed the enthusiasm of the staff. The centre eventually became too small and moved into Portakabins at the foot of Guys Tower. MacKeith, or Ronnie to his staff, remained there until he retired in 1974. MacKeith's most significant influence on paediatric practice was his gentle, modern and compassionate treatment of handicapped children while attending hospital and at home. He publicly supported a holistic inter-disciplinary approach, seeing the whole family, rather than the child and the disability. While formulating this approach, he wrote and collaborated on writing several books on the subject, along with several articles in Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology. During this period, he also consulted at the Cassel Hospital, being appointed in 1950 and appointed in 1960 to the Tavistock Clinic. In the 1950s, MacKeith became director of the medical communications department of the National Spastics Society (now SCOPE), a position he held until his death. He founded the Cerebral Palsy Bulletin during February 1958, which later grew by 1962, into the Journal of Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology. He recorded a series of Monographs called the Clinics in Developmental Medicine that were recordings of his study group at Oxford called the International Study Group on Child Neurology. These became associated with the journal from 1958 to 1972 and were widely read in the Paediatric community. ==Bibliography== * The child and his symptoms: a comprehensive approach., John Apley, Ronald Charles MacKeith.

During severe weather situations, Watch Information Statements for government-designated jurisdictions served by the local NWR station are typically inserted within the station's normal playlist of routine products; a special severe weather playlist temporarily suspends most regularly scheduled routine products in the event National Weather Service-issued warnings (mainly severe thunderstorm, tornado or flash flood warnings) are in effect for the station's broadcast area, which solely incorporate watch, warning and Special Weather Statements, and any active Short-Term Forecasts and Hazardous Weather Outlooks. == Routine forecast == Unless there is a significant event or test occurring, the typical broadcast cycle includes the following:  Hourly weather  A typical hourly observation report, which is updated once (or twice depending on the station or National Weather Service office, or whether severe weather conditions are ongoing) per hour at 5 or 10 and at 15 minutes past the hour, heard over NOAA Weather Radio stations features the following information: * A complete detail of current weather conditions (current sky condition, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed/direction and barometric pressure) for the main reporting station in the station's city of license. * Current observations usually limited to sky condition, temperature and wind speed/direction (although accompanied by dew point, humidity and pressure data on some NWR stations) within of the Weather Forecast Office and main reporting areas. * Current sky condition and temperature observations (accompanied by wind speed/direction data on certain stations) within of the WFO area of responsibility. Conditions for the closest observation site are typically used as a substitute in the lead of the segment if no report is available from the main reporting station, in which case the substituted station's observations will not be repeated at the end of the segment. In some locales, in the event any weather reporting station (whether the main station or a distant site) whose condition reports are regularly included in the segment had absent data, or no data available, the following message would be played in its place: In some areas, a major city featured within the regional observations would always provide weather conditions; if a condition report is unavailable, the message \\"the weather conditions were not available\\" would precede the city. In addition, the regional portion of the segment may be condensed to a roundup format for select or all cities, if temperatures are within a 5° range and/or if sky conditions are the same or differ limitedly at each given reporting site (for example: \\"skies ranged from sunny to mostly sunny, and temperatures were between 57 and 62 degrees\\"). Sky conditions and/or temperatures for individual weather reporting stations may only be mentioned if weather conditions differ between multiple locations. Occasionally, due to technical or other issues, the previous hour's observations segment may be included in the product playlist as long as 15 minutes into the next hour, after which it is removed until updated information is available.  Sample hourly weather roundup  Here is an example taken from NOAA Weather Radio station WXJ75 in Springfield, Illinois, at 8:00 a.m. on September 7, 2017. The Weather Radio Audio generator interprets the Area Weather Roundup below to generate this text for the Springfield Weather Radio Transmitter: The product below then translates temperatures from programmed sites at the following sites: Peoria, Bloomington, Champaign, Decatur, Lincoln, Taylorville, Litchfield, Jacksonville, and Quincy. It is translated: The observations for Springfield are then re-emphasized: Then every cycle between :05 and :59 of each hour, observations from Chicago, Indianapolis, Saint Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Milwaukee are provided as interpreted from the Area Weather Roundup product shown below: Generation of this segment usually takes longer, as the Kansas City report requires the product to interpret another Area Weather Roundup product issued by the National Weather Service office in Springfield, MO. 000 NZUS43 KILX 071310 HWRILX Area Weather Roundup National Weather Service Lincoln IL 800 AM CDT THU SEP 07 2017 NOTE: \\"FAIR\\" indicates few or no clouds below 12,000 feet, with no significant weather and/or obstructions to visibility.

The outlook will include information about potential thunderstorm activity (including any areas forecast to be under threat of severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, wildfire, extremes of heat or cold, or other conditions that may pose a hazard or threat to travel, life and/or property. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, along with a call for action for NWS-trained SKYWARN volunteer weather spotters to be prepared to report their local weather conditions and/or damage reports back to the local NWS office. Other outlooks are issued on an event- driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Public Severe Weather Outlook. Occasionally, a NWS WFO may update the Hazardous Weather Outlook while an event is ongoing or if forecast models denote changes from previous forecasts. Depending on the Weather Forecast Office, the Hazardous Weather Outlook may either state all weather hazards for the seven-day period or may separate them by the current day and the succeeding six days (days two through seven) of the forecast period. = Sample hazardous weather outlook = The following example of a Hazardous Weather Outlook was issued by the National Weather Service in North Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 24, 2011: HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR 445 AM CST THU FEB 24 2011 ARZ003>007-012>016-021>025-030>034-037>047-052>057-062>069-251045-ARKANSAS- BAXTER-BOONE-BRADLEY-CALHOUN-CLARK-CLEBURNE-CLEVELAND- CONWAY-DALLAS-DESHA- DREW-FAULKNER-FULTON-GARLAND-GRANT-HOT SPRING- INDEPENDENCE-IZARD-JACKSON- JEFFERSON-JOHNSON-LINCOLN-LOGAN-LONOKE- MARION-MONROE-MONTGOMERY-NEWTON- OUACHITA-PERRY-PIKE-POLK-POPE- PRAIRIE-PULASKI-SALINE-SCOTT-SEARCY-SHARP- STONE-VAN BUREN-WHITE- WOODRUFF-YELL- 445 AM CST THU FEB 24 2011 THIS HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK IS FOR A LARGE PART OF ARKANSAS. .DAY ONE ...

THE MAIN THREAT EXPECTED FROM THESE STORMS IS LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. AFTERNOON HIGHS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 70S THROUGHOUT NORTH TEXAS. RAIN CHANCES WILL DECREASE EASTWARD AS THE BOUNDARY EXITS THE REGION THIS EVENING. SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO CLEAR OVERNIGHT WITH LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. THE WEEKEND WILL BE PLEASANT AND WARM WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES NEAR 80.  Daily climate summary  In most cases, this information is included in the above regional weather synopsis. climate summaries comprise three separate general information products illustrating recently observed weather conditions: * Area climate summary – In most areas, this summary is played in 15-minute intervals each program cycle (generally mornings from 4:00 to 10:00 a.m. local time). The summary includes information on the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded the previous day; 30-year temperature averages and historical temperature extremes. It may also include the previous day's recorded precipitation, and monthly and annual total precipitation in comparison to their respective 30-year averages; and heating and/or cooling degree day data. In many areas, the sunrise and sunset times for the next two days are stated, whereas in other areas, the sunrise and sunset times are featured as a separate report. * Regional climate summary – Generally broadcast in the cycle from the mid-morning to early afternoon. This summary includes actual high and low temperatures and precipitation amounts for regional sections of the area recorded between 7:00 a.m. local time the previous day and 7:00 a.m. the present day. * Afternoon climate summary – In most areas this report is replaced by the area climate summary, however it may be included on specific days of the week (sometime between 5:00 and 9:00 p.m.). The summary provides information on minimum and maximum temperatures, and total precipitation recorded since 12:00 a.m. local time. Reports from other stations around the listening area are also included into local report for a more comprehensive record. The afternoon climate summary states the average and extreme temperatures and average and current monthly/annual precipitation totals for the date. The summary is subject to updates due to changes in maximum and/or minimum temperature or measured precipitation recorded during the broadcast period.  Regional forecast  This product offers weather summaries for all the counties across the listening area. It is updated four times daily at 4:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. (but more during severe or changeable weather). A regional weather roundup is updated hourly. Regional weather conditions are summarised at predetermined times. There is also a three- to five-day extended forecast product, which is updated twice per day at sometime between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m.  Specialty forecasts  The following are not included during most broadcast cycles or are only played as needed depending on local weather.  Short term forecast  A short term forecast is a localized, event-driven report used to provide the public with detailed weather information during significant and/or rapidly changing weather conditions during the next six hours. This forecast will often mention the position of precipitation as detected by radar. In most areas, this is the only forecast product that is permitted to air both during active severe weather warnings affecting the listening area and during routine forecast program cycles.  Special weather statement  A special weather statement is a regional event-driven and is used to provide the public with details of the upcoming significant weather event, such as a major winter storm, a heat wave, or potential flooding. A significant weather advisory may be issued within a Special Weather Statement, often if thunderstorm activity whether severe or not is occurring in, or approaching an area. = Sample special weather statement = The following example of a special weather statement was issued by the National Weather Service office in San Angelo, Texas, on September 6, 2010 regarding that year's Tropical Storm Hermine: SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAN ANGELO TX 532 AM CDT MON SEP 6 2010 TXZ049-054-064>066-071>073-076>078-098-099-113-114-127-128-139- 140-154-155-168>170-061715- FISHER-NOLAN-STERLING-COKE-RUNNELS-IRION-TOM GREEN-CONCHO- CROCKETT-SCHLEICHER-SUTTON-HASKELL-THROCKMORTON-JONES- SHACKELFORD- TAYLOR-CALLAHAN-COLEMAN-BROWN-MCCULLOCH-SAN SABA-MENARD-KIMBLE- MASON- INCLUDING THE CITIES OF ...

BASED ON THE LATEST FORECAST TRACK ... WIDESPREAD 2 TO 4 INCHES WITH ISOLATED 4 TO 8 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS WEST CENTRAL TEXAS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  Record information announcement  A record information announcement announces information on newly set records for coldest/warmest maximum and/or minimum temperature and maximum precipitation. This forecast is only included in the broadcast when such events occur.  Surf zone forecast  A Surf zone forecast is a text forecast for local beaches issued by coastal stations, including coastal hazard information such as that pertaining to rip currents. These products are issued year-round at the Los Angeles/Oxnard, San Diego and New York City offices, and seasonally at most other coastal offices.  River forecast  This forecast is not usually included in many reports unless there is a potential for flooding or flooding is occurring, which would then be included with the hazardous weather outlook Daily river forecasts are issued by the 13 river forecast centers using hydrologic models based on variables such as rainfall, soil characteristics and precipitation forecasts. Some forecasts, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts. A separate forecast, River and Small Stream Observations, is broadcast in areas in and outside the 13 river forecast centers and is only broadcast following a significant hydrological event featuring information on crests, and present and forecasted flood stages.  Lake forecast  Lake forecasts (sometimes referred to as \\"nearshore marine forecasts\\" and \\"open waters forecast\\"; depending on the station and area) are issued by most stations in the Great Lakes region to explicitly state expected weather conditions within the marine forecast area through the next five days. The report addresses expected wave heights and small-craft advisories currently in effect.  Coastal waters forecast  A Coastal Waters Forecast states expected weather conditions and wave heights within the marine forecast area through the next five days.  Offshore waters forecast  An offshore waters forecast is issued by the Ocean Prediction Center and provides a five-day forecast and warning information intended for mariners travelling on oceanic waters adjacent to the U.S. coastline.  Tropical weather summary  Tropical weather summaries are an event-driven report updated every three hours, which provides an information summary on any active tropical cyclones. Activity summaries for the Atlantic Basin are typically included with stations located in states near the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, while stations along the West Coast receive summaries concerning the Pacific Ocean. Depending on the station and associated Weather Forecast Office, listeners can hear this report at the top and bottom of every hour.

He made his debut in A Slope in the Sun (1958) playing Ishihara's younger brother. The studio initially sold him as one of the \\"Bad Trio\\" along with Akira Kobayashi and Tadao Sawamoto. He appeared in films by Koreyoshi Kurahara and Seijun Suzuki and is probably most known abroad for his starring roles in Kurahara's The Warped Ones (1960) and Black Sun (1964). Kawachi eventually left Nikkatsu for the Toei Company, and co-starred in the 9-film Mamushi kyōdai series with Bunta Sugawara in the 1970s. He also acted on television, with his last acting appearance being a TV mystery in 2017.

Zhirinovsky ran on an ultranationalist platform. Widely unknown to most Russians at the start of the brief campaign period, Zhirinovsky ultimately managed a surprise third-place finish in the election. ==Campaigning== Initial campaign developments On April 12 the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union, a party led by Zhirinovsky, became the second national party (after the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) to be officially registered by the Soviet Union (which had two weeks earlier revoked Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, thus allowing for the registration of multiple parties). The following day, the party held its second congress and nominated Zhirinovsky to be its candidate in Russia's upcoming presidential election. After Boris Yeltsin, Zhirinovsky was the second individual to declare their candidacy for the presidency. Registration There were two ways for candidates to receive ballot registration, the first was through a signature drive and the second was through approval of 20% of the legislature. Zhirinovsky opted for the latter option, and thus did not turn in signatures by the deadline to register via signature drive. A vote was held in the legislature on May 22 on whether or not to approve his candidacy. At this point, there were only twenty days left until the election. In the speech he delivered to the parliament, prior to their vote on whether to approve his candidacy, Zhirinovsky was rather restrained by his standards. The speech had populist undertones (he declared, \\"Whom do I represent? Not the people at the top, from the elite. And not from the bottom—prison guards, drunkards and homeless. No. Our common people are millions of Soviet citizens.\\") In the midst of his speech he switched from the Russian language to Turkey, in an effort to pander to Turish-language deputies from Russia's Muslim republics. The speech was found to be theatrical, lively, and entertaining. In the May 22 vote of the legislature Zhirinovsky received far more than the necessary number of votes (he received 477 votes, while he only needed 213 votes), thus attaining ballot registration. It was believed that part of reason why Zhirinovsky was able to garner enough endorsements was that the communists hoped he might be a spoiler, draining enough votes from Yeltsin to force a runoff. For his vice-presidential running mate, Zhirinovsky chose Andrey Zavidiya, who had helped to provide Zhirinvosky funding for his campaign. Final stretch Once Zhirinovsky's candidacy was given ballot approval, there were only twenty days left before the election. During this period Zhirinovsky travelled extensively, holding many rallies in cities across Russia. He orchestrated a vigorous campaign blitz which was far more intensive than the itineraries maintained by other candidates. For example, on a day in June Zhirinovsky's itenerary saw him (the day after having flown to Chelyabinsk and been driven directly from the airport to a television studio) start his morning by meeting with deputies of the Chelyablinsk Duma, then meet with students at the Thermal Technology Institute, they have a lunch break while at a tractor factory before speaking to the workers. During his aforementioned visit to a Chelyabinsk tractor factory, the workers he spoke to were largely pro-Yelstin. He told them, \\"I have never been in power, I am not to be blamed for the disaster Russia now faces.\\" The workers jeered him, shouting, \\"We're still going to vote for Yeltsin anyway.\\" Seemingly acknowledging expectations to lose against Yeltsin, and revealing intentions to run again Zhirinovsky replied, Zhirinovsky had personally claimed to anticipate receiving between ten and twenty percent of the vote.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/jspui/bitstream/10603/21060/9/09_chapter%25204.pdf Result and aftermath Zhirinovsky's campaign headquarters began celebrating on June 13, after state media had reported Zhirinovsky to have garnered a sizable vote share in the preliminary count. Zhirinivsky remarked to reporters, \\"my performance is consistent with my expectations.\\" Zhirinovsky placed third in the election. The strength of Zhirninovsky's performance surprised many. In some areas of Russia, Zhirinovsky garnered as much as 20% of the vote. Zhirinovsky's third-place finish positioned him as a serious political figure, particularly after Liberal Democratic Party's strong performance in the 1993 legislative election. Many expressed concerns about Zhirinovsky's new popularity. Leaders on both ends of the political spectrum viewed him as a populist with dictatorial aspirations. Some Soviet analysts went as far as comparing his rise to Adolf Hitler's early career. Zhirinovsky ultimately used his third-place finish to bring the Liberal Democratic Party to prominence. Additionally, on June 20, just eight days after losing the Russian presidential election, Zhirinovsky announced his candidacy for elections of USSR President, which were scheduled for March 1995. =Contesting the results= The day after the election, Zhirinovsky told Russian TV that he would have won the presidential election if he had been able to conduct his election campaign for three months rather than just twenty days. The same day, the Rab- ochaya tribuna reported that Zhirinovsky had filed a protest seeking to annul the votes received by Yeltsin, arguing that Yeltsin had used his official position as speaker of parliament to his advantage in the election. He pointed to actions such as Yeltsin telling members of the police force to vote for him and Yeltsin's use of state resources such as his use government printing presses for campaign material, RSFSR TV, and his use of state airplane for travel. ==Support== Zhirinovsky was, at first, regarded as little more clown by many in Russia, who did not take his candidacy seriously. He was seen merely as a cheap populist. He had only recently risen as a leader within the fringes of Russia's the far-right and was widely unknown to most voters. His Liberal Democratic Party was widely considered to be a fringe party and had been believed to have lacked strong support. His campaign also possessed very limited financial resources. The 1991 presidential election served as Zhirinovsky's first major outing on the Russian political scene. He, by far, trailed the other candidates in name recognition. Zhirinovsky initially faced prospective competition from Vladimir Voronin. Both Zhirinovsky and Vladimir Voronin had been leading figures within the Centrist Bloc, a coalition of groups that had been created in 1990 (with the alleged involvement of the KGB) and collapsed in April 1991 (after being hijacked by right-wing figures such as Zhirinovsky). On April 18 Voronin became the third invididual to put themselves forward as a candidate or the presidency. However, Vorinin ultimately failed to become a registered candidate thus negating his potential impact on Zhirinovsky's performance. The key advertising slogans that Zhirinovsky's campaign adopted were, “the last hope of a cheated and humiliated people\\" and “the very same as you”. In his speeches, Zhirinovsky painted a dark picture of Russia's future under his opponents. He warned voters that he was the \\"only\\" candidate who could rescue Russia from the danger of a civil war. An ultranationalist candidate, Zhrinovsky played to the racial resentments which some ethnic Russians held against minorities. He was criticized for playing to the \\"base instincts\\" and \\"depravity\\" of voters by using appeals to sado-masochistic tendencies. Zhirinovsky's performance in the election surprised analysts, largely, because they had not detected there to be a base of support for him. While other candidates seen to have clear social bases (Yeltsin was supported by those in favor of radical reforms, Rhyzhkov and Bakatin were supported by opponents of reform, Mashakov was supported by neo-Stalinists), none was observed for Zhirinovsky. This is, in part, because Zhirinovsky's support did not necessarily have a binding ideology. The largest segment of Zhirnovsky's voter support came from those who had been marginalized by social and political forces. Between 50 and 90 percent of voters who were serving as inmates in prison and labor camps voted for Zhirinovsky, significant since Russia had a prison population of nearly one million. Zhirinovsky also received a strong portion of the votes from policemen, special riot troops, those in KGB and Interior Ministry schools, and pensioners. Nearly half of his voters had either graduated or at least attended some college. Sociologist Igor Yakovenko had observed that many in a number of these groups were particularly concerned about potential unemployment or being forced to leave their profession due to socioeconomic changes. Yakovenko had observed that, \\"There are Zhirinovsky's in every country. But they are supported everywhere by only those segments of society that have nothing to lose...Zhirinovsky's popularity will grow in proportion to how bad the political and economic situation will get.\\" By his own admission, Zhirinovsky benefited as a candidate from the negative economic prospects many Russians were facing, saying, “If there were a healthy economy and security for the people, I would lose all the votes I have.\\" Zhirinvosky appealed to voters who desired to see order under the authoritarian leadership of a vozhd. Zhirinovsky also benefited from the appeal of his energetic rhetorical flair and from having a well-financed and well-organized campaign. In his promise of cheap and universal vodka, Zhirinovsky courted Russia's alcoholics, who had suffered financially from Gorbachev's anti-alcohol programs, which had led to alcohol prices skyrocketing. ==Platform== Zhirinovsky promised to, “bring Russia up off its knees\\". Zhirinovsky was an ultranationalist. He championed a return to a tsarist style of government. He promised to reform the system of government, remove all limitations on economic activities, phase-out conscription in Russia's military, be tough in regards to law enforcement. Zhirinosky also prominently promised to lower prices on alcohol and to demand its sale in all commercial outlets. He summarized this campaign pledge by promising cheap vodka, \\"at every corner, around the clock if I win.\\" Zhirinovsky also vowed that he would adopt measures within the limits of the law in order to stop \\"anti-communist hysteria and witch-hunting\\". Zhirinovsky promised to change Russia's foreign policy. He argued that the conflict between the East and the West had ended and that it was time for Russia to shift their focus to relations between the North and the South. At a rally in Perm, Zhirinovsky promised not to remove the privileges provided to the military-industrial industry in the city due to the fact that the export of weapons was a strong source of revenue for the country. ==See also== *Vladimir Zhirinovsky 1996 presidential campaign *Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2000 presidential campaign *Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2008 presidential campaign *Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2012 presidential campaign *Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2018 presidential campaign ==References== presidential campaign 1991 Zhirinovsky ","title":"Vladimir Zhirinovsky 1991 presidential campaign"},{"id":"56562168","text":"Ruth Silverman (born 1936 or 1937, died April 25, 2011) was an American mathematician and computer scientist known for her research in computational geometry.

She reached Canada and freedom in 1842. Multiple abolitionists helped Caroline on her journey to Canada even as pursuers followed continuously. ==Early life== Caroline Quarlls was born in St. Louis in 1826, to her Father, and owner, Robert Pryor Quarlls. At her home in Missouri, Caroline had two white half-sisters, whom she allegedly looked like, but was not granted the same freedom as they were. Upon her father's passing, she was acquired by her new mistress, Robert's sister and her own aunt, Mrs. Charles R. Hall. Caroline was never badly beaten as a slave, occasionally whipped and punished, but nothing too severe physically. Noted as being quite intelligent, she was never taught to read or write and was brought up doing fine sewing, embroidery, and wait upon her mistress. Caroline wanted to be free and thought it over for a long time while enslaved, listening to talk of the north for over a year. At this point Caroline was around 15 or 16, her mistress became angry with her at one point and cut her hair off which directly effected her decision to escape to the north. She managed to gain possession of $100, and the permission from her mistress to see a sick girl. Caroline threw a bundle of clothes out a window and after saying good bye to her friend, she returned to pick up the bundle of clothes she threw out the window and walked down to the ferry. ==Biography== In 1842, Caroline Quarlls, a 16 year old fugitive slave from Missouri, was the first escaped slave to use Wisconsin's \\"Underground Railroad.\\" Quarlls successfully traveled from Missouri to Canada via a network of secret routes and safe houses that helped escaped slaves. Enslaved by her paternal grandfather to work as a housemaid in St. Louis, Missouri, Quarll did not receive the care her other siblings received and began her escape. Quarlls was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1826. On July 4, 1842 she was able to escape Missouri, after taking $100 from her former master, by passing as a white girl (Caroline was 1/2 white) and purchasing a ticket for a steamboat to Alton, Illinois. There was a $300 bounty placed on her and she was pursued through Illinois until she was brought across the Milwaukee River by prominent attorney Asahel Finch; he hid her in a barrel in the boat. The former master hired lawyers to pursue Caroline as she passed through Wisconsin. From Milwaukee, Caroline was brought to Pewaukee, WI by Samuel Brown; the two traveled via an old rickety wagon. She avoided capture by sheltering with abolitionists until she made her way into Canada. Her journey lasted 5 weeks throughout multiple states into Canada. One of the Railroad's conductors, Lyman Goodnow, later recounted the story of Quarlls' journey. Lyman Goodnow, a Waukesha man, was the first \\"conductor\\" of Wisconsin's underground railroad. The two traveled 31 miles altogether into Canada; abolitionists gave the two a purse of travel necessities to hep the two cross the border.Davidson, John Nelson. Negro Slavery in Wisconsin and the Underground Railroad. No. 18. Parkman Club, 1897. After arriving in Canada, Quarlls married Allen Watkins, himself a freed slave, and they raised six children. Caroline learned to read and write as she started attending school within one year of her arrival. Caroline wrote of not being happy despite her marriage and children; she wrote that if she had stayed, the property on which she was once enslaved would have been hers.“Caroline Quarlls - First Underground Railroad ‘Passenger’ in Wisconsin.” Burlington History, www.burlingtonhistory.org/caroline-quarlls-first- underground-railroad-passenger-wisconsin.

Monte Collins (Calhern), a man of means and popular with the women of his set, visits his friend in the mountains. His airplane crashes near the cabin, and during his convalescence he falls in love with Anne and the two are married. Back in civilization, their marriage is a happy one until Monte tires of evenings spend home at the fireside, and he seeks recreation among his friends at the cabaret. Thereupon his wife, to teach him a lesson, takes a dancing course and acquires a lot of new gowns. With the aid of Henry Mortimer (Meredith), an old time friend and former suitor, who escorts her to a series of parties and affairs, she teaches her husband a lesson as Monte is much distracted. This comes to a climax when Henry and Anne are returning from an island excursion and the boat goes dead at sea, forcing them to remain there overnight. Monte becomes desperate and attempts to kill Henry, but Anne comes between them and falsely claims to love Henry. Later, after Monte learns the truth of what happened, he returns home only to discover that his wife has left. Surmising that she has probably gone back to the cabin in the mountains, he uses his airplane to beat her there. Here they both admit to having learned their lessons and are reconciled. ==Cast== *Florence Vidor as Anne Clegg *Charles Meredith as Henry Mortimer *Louis Calhern as Monte Collins ==ReferencesCategory:1922 films Category:Lost American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:1922 comedy-drama films Category:1922 comedy films Category:1922 drama films ","title":"Woman, Wake Up"},{"id":"56563039","text":"Henry Martyn Long (October 28, 1836 in Pittsburgh – December 24, 1909) was a politician and businessman in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.

Haskell attended Bard College in the late 1990s, where he studied poetry and was a student of John Ashbery.John Ashbery, Collected Poems 1956-1987, edited by Mark Ford. (New York: The Library of America, 2008.), p. 1003. After college, he worked for David Wolkowsky, ferrying guests to Wolkowsky’s private island and doing other odd jobs. ==Career== In 2017, Haskell authored and published his first work of nonfiction, The Jews of Key West: Smugglers, Cigar Makers, and Revolutionaries (1823-1969) (Sand Paper Press). Critics generally praised the social history for its depth of research and style, arguing that it had filled gaps in regional Florida history and in American Jewish history.Marilyn Bowden, Miami Today, November 30, 2017, p. 23. In a review for the Journal of the Southern Jewish Historical Society, Raymond Arsenault remarked that it “introduces a fascinating cast of characters, revealing a unique saga of Jewish community life that no previous historian has chronicled.”Raymond Arsenault, Southern Jewish History, Vol. 21. (Charleston, 2018), p. 182-5. The Jews of Key West won the Phillip and Dana Zimmerman Gold Medal for Florida Nonfiction from the Florida Book Awards and a President’s Medal from the Florida Authors and Publishers Association. Haskell is also the author of the poetry collection, Joker (Sand Paper Press, 2009). Haskell is the publisher of Sand Paper Press, a small press he founded in 2003, where he has frequently collaborated with poet and translator Stuart Krimko. Publications include The Last Books of Héctor Viel Temperley (2011), which was translated from Spanish by Krimko and named a BOMB (magazine) Editor’s Choice. Another Sand Paper title, Harry Mathews’s The New Tourism (2010), was co-edited by Haskell and selected as a “Book of the Year” by The Times Literary Supplement.Times Literary Supplement, June 24, 2011. Haskell is currently executive director of Key West Literary Seminar, the nonprofit organization whose eponymous writers’ conference has been held annually since 1983. His career with the organization began in 2008, when he led the digitization of its extensive audio archive. Since his promotion to executive director in 2015, Haskell has increased the organization’s scholarship program, launched a literary walking tour of Key West, and created writing programs for local high school students. In 2019, he led the organization in its $1.2 million purchase of the former home of poet Elizabeth Bishop.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/books/elizabeth-bishop-home-key- west.html On June 4, 2019, Haskell was proclaimed the Poet Laureate of Key West by the Mayor, Vice Mayor and Board of Commissioners of Key West. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American publishers (people) Category:Bard College alumni Category:People from Key West, Florida Category:Writers from Florida ","title":"Arlo Haskell"},{"id":"56563331","text":"is a song recorded by Japanese singer Maaya Sakamoto.

It is the 29th overall episode of the series and is written by co-executive producer Luke Del Tredici and directed by Linda Mendoza. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 16, 2014. It's the eight episode of the season to be produced but it's the seventh to be broadcast. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake is appointed Captain of the precinct when Holt and Terry leave for a charity event on Thanksgiving. However, the precinct goes on a lockdown when a mysterious powder spreads on the precinct with the HAZMAT unit working to determine if the precinct is toxic. The episode was seen by an estimated 4.53 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised Samberg's performance in the episode but criticized the episode's focus on Jake while leaving most of the supporting cast sidelined. ==Plot== Holt (Andre Braugher) and Terry (Terry Crews) leave for a charity event at Brighton Beach and put Jake (Andy Samberg) in charge of the precinct. Just when everyone is about to leave for Thanksgiving, Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) accidentally gets a package that contains a rare powder, forcing the precinct to go lockdown as other packages were sent to other precincts in the latest days. The incident forces Holt and Terry to skip the event and stop at Terry's house to monitor the situation. However, Terry's brother-in-law, Zeke (Jamal Duff), is in the house and is constantly bullying him. Zeke then begins to make amends with Terry when he believes that Terry has a terrible boss just like him. When Terry and Holt leave for the precinct, Terry asks Holt to act as a bad boss in front of him. With the building in quarantine by the HAZMAT unit, Jake tries to calm everyone in an attempt to smooth the situation. However, when one of the people discover that the powder may be toxic, he reveals it to everyone, causing a mutiny. Using an advice from Amy (Melissa Fumero), Jake makes his position known to everyone, threatening to arrest everyone who challenges his authority just when the unit returns and proclaim that the powder isn't toxic just as Holt and Terry return. ==Reception== Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Lockdown\\" was seen by an estimated 4.53 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 13% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.99 million viewers with a 1.9/5 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Bob's Burgers and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, The OT, and NBC Sunday Night Football. Critical reviews \\"Lockdown\\" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"To those viewers who have been finding season two of Brooklyn Nine- Nine to be weaker than season one, 'Lockdown' might actually be the perfect example of that dip. Throughout the entire episode, there's just constant shallow characterization — which is extremely uncharacteristic at this point in the series —that takes Brooklyn Nine-Nine to a dark place, quality-wise. That's because it takes it to The Jake Peralta Show. Jake Peralta is a good character, and I've sung his praises in most (if not all) of these reviews, but when the show makes him the sole focus and only relies him, with everyone else as nothing more than his sounding boards, the downshift in quality is palpable.\\" Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"While 'Lockdown' all but forgets that history — Jake says he hates the holiday because 'the pilgrims were murderers and turkeys taste like napkins' — it does dig into Jake's surprisingly deep neurosis, and specifically his irrepressible desire to please everyone. In doing so, 'Lockdown' manages to put another spin on Andy Samberg's typically broad performance, making his eternally upbeat attitude seem manic and even desperate. It's not a perfect episode by any means, but it opens up a lot of possibilities for the character.\\" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"'Lockdown' lacked the absurdist zip of some of the other stuck-in-the-precinct episodes, like 'The Jimmy Jab Games' or the first Halloween episode. (The closest we got: Boyle doing the 'Single Ladies' dance, with two perps backing him up from behind the doors of the holding cell.) It still boasted plenty of good laugh lines, but I would have loved to see more advantage taken of the wild cast of characters stuck in there, who were more or less reduced to an angry mob despite getting some really awesome team nicknames.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"'Lockdown' felt like a throwback to those frustrating episodes from early in the first season where Jake would spend 80 percent of the episode ignoring obviously wise advice from Captain Holt, getting deeper and deeper into trouble until he finally listened. It's a pattern I'd hoped both Jake and the show had moved beyond, but here we got a variation on it, with Amy playing the role of Holt – even though, technically, the whole story was about Jake having to fill in for the captain on Thanksgiving. That Jake wants to be everybody's buddy, rather than the stern authority figure he's temporarily replacing, fits his character, but the whole A-story dragged as we waited for Jake to stop being such an idiot. With that many characters stuck in one location, there were some amusing moments in the margins (my favorite was Boyle doing the 'Single Ladies' dance with the hookers), but on a whole, this one didn't work.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 6.8 and wrote, \\"'Lockdown' has a strong set-up and great jokes at its fingertips, but it doesn't have much direction, either. That leads to a whole lot of nothing, instead of growth among the show’s primary and secondary cast members; if anybody really learns anything here, it's Jake, put in charge over Amy for reasons that the script treats as perfunctory.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2014 American television episodes Category:Brooklyn Nine- Nine (season 2) episodes ","title":"Lockdown (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)"},{"id":"56563487","text":"Inmyeonjo (Hangul : 인면조, Hanja : 人面鳥, literally Human face bird) is a mythological creature from Korea, that appears as a bird with a human face. Most of them are women, and some are male. Inmyeonjo is known as a sacred bird that connects the sky with the land, often appearing in the ancient tomb mural of Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the case of Goguryeo, it can be found in several tomb murals such as the Anak County tombs, the ancient Dukheungri tombs, the Samsilchong, and the Mooyongchong. Named as Cheonchu(天秋) and Mansei(萬歲) in the ancient Dukheungri tombs in Nampo, South Pyongan Province in 1976, they are a symbol of longevity, known to live for a thousand years. In the case of Silla, the gilt-bronze shoes excavated in Gyeongju is shown. In the case of Baekje, four inmyeonjos are found in the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje. In particular, there are many opinions that inmyeonjo in the Silver Cup with Bronze Stand (銅托銀盞) is the same as it in Goguryeo for a symbol of longevity. On the other hand, there are some opinions that it is Kalaviṅka because of shape of the wings. Kalaviṅka is an imaginary creature that tells the Buddha's words that appear in ancient Indian myths and Buddhist texts. Meanwhile, in the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, inmyeonjo attracted the attention of the whole world. == Korean culture == In Korea, after the 5th century, artifacts and mural paintings that show the shape of a human-faced bird in Goguryeo and Baekje tombs are found. The inmyeonjo is depicted in the bottom of the Silver Cup with Bronze Stand(銅托銀盞) excavated from the Tomb of King Muryeong in Gongju of South Chungcheong Province. The creature's head and arms are human, but the body is a bird, and the head is wearing a corolla with feathers of birds. In the tomb of Dukheungri in South Pyongan Province, and in the Mooyongchong in Manchuria, mural paintings are found. In particular, the inmyeonjo painted on the ceiling of the Mooyongchong had been wearing long hats that Xian loved to show the fusion of Buddhism and Taoism culture. == Buddhist culture == It is interpreted that it contains the meaning to pray for Sukhavati(極樂往生) of Pure land(淨土) under the influence of Kalaviṅka (迦陵迦迦) of Buddhism found in the tombs of Goguryo and Baekje. Kalaviṅka is a bird that appears in the Sanskrit word \\"kalavinka\\" in Chinese characters. It is a bird that comes from living in Sukhavati of Amitābha. It is said that the upper part of the body is a person, and the lower part is a bird. Also, it is said that it has very beautiful and strange voice before it comes out from the shell. So it has many other names, and it is considered a symbol of the Buddha's teachings. In Buddhist art in East Asia, not only in Korea but also in China and Japan, there are a wide range of artifacts depicting Kalaviṅka, which are also depicted as dancing or playing music on the murals of Dunhuang. On the other hand, Buddhism's Kalaviṅka is influenced by Indian mythology. Gandharva is a man whose an upper body is male, and a lower body of a bird or horse, and has a golden wing, while serving Indra in Hindu mythology and playing musics of Devaloka(天界). In the Southeast Asian Buddhism such as Thailand and other countries, inmyeonjo is a god with Gandharva who are in charge of music. Inmyeonjo also appears in traditional Chinese mythology and Taoism culture. It is recorded in the \\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\\". They are also said to have a bird's body on the face of a man and live as a name for a long time. == Western culture == Creatures resembling the inmyeonjo also appears in Greek mythology. Homeros and Hesiodos records include the name Siren. At first, only the head was human, and the body was drawn as a bird, but gradually the entire upper body was depicted as a beautiful woman with musical instruments. Sirens were thought to seduce the sailors in a very sweet sound and sink their ships. In Virgil's \\"Aeneid\\", the name \\"Harpy\\" appears. According to legend, a harpy is a bird with a woman's face, flying faster than the wind and eating children and human souls. == In the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang == The giant mythological creature, called “Inmyeonjo” in Korean, appeared onstage following the countdown in the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang. Many viewers focused on a giant puppet of a human-faced bird. It soon moved to the center of the stage, surrounded by the Four Symbols \\"blue dragon, white tiger, red phoenix, black tortoise\\" and dancing women dressed in costumes of the ancient Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. The animal's long neck and dragon-like body, combined with its human face, grabbed the attention of many spectators. “Through this, I wanted to depict a world where humans live in peaceful harmony with ancient nature and animals,” the opening ceremony's executive creative director, Song Seung-whan, said. The Inmyeonjo is a legendary animal that appears in East Asian mythology and Buddhist scripture as a fantastical creature with a human head and a bird's torso. Inmyeonjo is a fantastical animal known to travel across the land and the sky and live a thousand years, symbolizing longevity. It dates back to the Goguryeo period of Korean history, even appearing in cave drawings. The Inmyeonjo is supposed to appear when there's peace on earth, connecting the heavens and the earth for a thousand years. The appearance of the facial expressions of Inmyeonjo has led to a wide variety of responses from around the world. There were negative opinions that it was horrible and bizarre, while there were positive opinions that it was marvelous at first seeing mythical creatures, respecting their culture. ==See also== *Simurgh == References == Category:Legendary birds Category:Korean mythology Category:Korean legendary creatures ","title":"Inmyeonjo"},{"id":"56563494","text":"Drusilla Elizabeth Tandy Nixon (July 15, 1899 - May 10, 1990) was a community activist and music educator. ==Background== The daughter of Maud Grant and John Clifford Tandy, she was born Drusilla Elizabeth Tandy in Toledo, Ohio and was educated at Waite High School and the University of Toledo. ==Career== After the University was forced to close due to the 1918 flu pandemic, she was hired by the American Missionary Association in Georgia and sent to Atlanta.

Between five and thirty flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are light red, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, about long, wide and light reddish with prominent reddish-black bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, have a small gland on their tips and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark reddish bands. The labellum is elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide with its edges densely covered with short, purplish hairs.

His works express a style that blends naturalism and lyricism with modernist abstraction. Many of Weisenborn's films address race and issues of diversity, and his film People Along the Mississippi (1952), produced with John Barnes, is credited as being the first classroom film to depict interracial friendship. He worked with John Barnes on the Academy Award nominated film The Living City (1953), and won over 70 national and international awards for films and productions. He was listed as one of the top 20 makers of specialized film by the Directors Guild. == Personal life == Weisenborn was born in Chicago to Rudolph and Fritzie Weisenborn, who were both figures in the arts communities. Weisenborn's father was an internationally recognized Chicago Modernist painter and art instructor who is credited with creating the first abstract painting to be exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago. His mother, Fritizie, was an art critic for Chicago Sunday Times. Weisenborn attended the University of Chicago, where he majored in theatre. The Weisenborns befriended John Grierson who was known as the father of the documentary film. Weisenborn married Selma Revsin, with whom he partnered on a number of films until her death in 1980. Weisenborn died at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, at 64 years of age. Before his death, Weisenborn gave the rights to his films to Jack Behrend, an industrial filmmaker who he was good friends with. The rights to both Weisenborn's films and Behrend's films are currently held by the Chicago Film Archives. == Career == Weisenborn began his filmmaking career at the age of 19 as an assistant to pioneering documentary filmmaker John Grierson. Under Grierson's wing, Weisenborn began making films for the National Film Board of Canada, and built important relationships with other documentary filmmakers, including George Stoney. Over the course of his career, Gordon Weisenborn tried his hand as director, cinematographer, editor, writer, and producer, specializing in educational and sponsored films. He worked closely with his wife, Selma Revsin, on numerous films, including Mural Midwest Metropolis (1960), Girls Are Better Than Ever (1967), and Facing Up To Vandalism (1973), and with John Barnes, with whom he made numerous films, including People Along the Mississippi (1952), The Living City (1953), and various films to accompany \\"Dick and Jane\\" stories in the early 1950s. Weisenborn's career was highly influenced through his friendship with John Barnes and his wife Selma Revsin, and with them he created several films. Weisenborn and Barnes ended up splitting ways after a while of working together. The split geared Weisenborn towards sponsored films as well as industrial ones. Weisenborn began teaching at Columbia College Chicago in the 1960s. In 1970, Weisenborn started his own production company, Gordon Weisenborn Productions, Inc. Under his company, Weisenborn continued to produce sponsored and educational films.  Important Films  Weisenborn directed When Asia Speaks (1944) with producer Stuart Legg throughout his early career while he worked at the National Film Board of Canada. It was produced towards the end of WWII, and presents a Western perspective on Asian nationalism. The film also discusses ending colonialism. Another important work Gordon Weisenborn filmed was Feeling All Right (1948), which was sponsored by the Mississippi Board of Health and the United States Public Health Service as part of a multimedia campaign. Weisenborn was cinematographer for the work, and he worked alongside Fred Lasse and George Stoney in the creation of this piece. The award winning film was considered semidocumentary narrative in form and intended to promote public health within the African American community and, more specifically, educated the community about syphilis and its prevention. It was seen by as many an estimated one million viewers and incorporated into mobile testing units to drive testing for and treatment of the condition. Film director Raymond Spottiswoode praised the work for treating the usually overdramatized subject through a simple and frank approach, but the NAACP opposed the distribution of the film for fear it would worsen stigmatization, segregation, and inequality. Weisenborn worked alongside John Barnes in the creation of several films. One of these films is People Along the Mississippi (1952), a film Weisenborn shot and directed which is notable for its focus on social and ethnic diversity in the United States and is credited as being the first educational film to present children of diverse races interacting with each other. Although the film makes use of stylistic techniques typical of a documentary, it incorporates a somewhat mythic storyline as it traces ethnicities down the Mississippi River. Another film Weisenborn worked on with John Barnes was the Academy Award nominated film The Living City (1953). The film was produced for Encyclopædia Britannica Films and explored the solutions to city planning issues and other urban problems in American cities. Weisenborn worked as associate producer for another Academy Award nominee, The Naked Eye (1956), alongside director Louis Clyde Stoumen. The film was nominated for \\"Best Documentary Feature\\" at the 29th Academy Awards in 1957, and won the Robery J. Flaherty Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival and a Special Award at the Venice Film Festival. The film discusses the history of the camera and photography from invention through development. Mural Midwest Metropolis (1960) is considered one of Weisenborn's better known films. Weisenborn directed the film, and cowrote it with his wife, Selma Revsin. The award winning film, which was shot in and around Chicago, was produced by the Fred A. Niles Communications Center and sponsored by S&H; Green Stamps for the purpose of promoting the city of Chicago as a major tourist destination. Weisenborn also directed the feature length horror exploitation film Prime Time (1960) alongside producer Herschell Gordon Lewis. The film placed an emphasis on plot and character, and is credited as being the first feature film to be shot and produced entirely out of Chicago after the closing of Essanay studios. Weisenborn shot and directed Water is Wet (1969) for the television program The Metooshow, which aired on Chicago Public TV. The film is one of four short educational films that were produced by the Erikson Institute for Early Childhood Learning. The optimistic film is shot around Chicago and uses experimental methods and media. Using water as a motif, the film was intended to inspire children to learn through experience and connect them with their feelings.

The building was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 1988. ==Early life== Bouman was born in Groningen, Netherlands. His family emigrated to Australia when he was 7-years-old. Initially there were difficult beginnings living in distant Menangle Park, followed by then primitive circumstances in Oxford Falls, before the family settled in the Manly area. His education started at Manly Primary School, then Manly Boys High School, situated in North Curl Curl. Bouman studied architecture at University of NSW, after gaining a Commonwealth scholarship, graduating in 1966. Some years in London followed, including working in the office of Owen Luder Partnership as Design Architect. Back in Sydney, Bouman worked with Col Madigan in the office of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs from 1969-1975, initially as Design Architect, and later Associate Director. While in this office he joined with Chris Kringas, to win the Australia-wide competition for the High Court of Australia. In 1976 he commenced his own architectural practice in Balmain. ==Architecture milestones / achievements== { -  1973  High Court of Australia-Canberra.

Very few private housing projects are part of his portfolio. High Court of Australia, Canberra High Court of Australia, CanberraThe High Court of Australia is listed on the World Register of Significant 20th Century Architecture. It has been commented that; the major central space, with inviting access ramps, the clarity of court layout and visitor patterning, is one of the great public spaces in Australia. During the making of the 2012 video sessions, to document the history of the High Court, Chief Justice Robert French arranged for Feiko Bouman to receive a bronze commemorative medallion, in recognition of his original design co-authorship. Stockman’s Hall of Fame, Longreach, Queensland Stockman’s Hall of Fame, LongreachThis now iconic outback museum has been reviewed, photographed and commented upon extensively in many forums, publications and video media. Despite its relatively remote location, hundreds of thousands of visitors have made the trek. Architectural historian, Philip Drew, has written many articles in architecture journals, as well as in mainstream media. He has commented that \\" the museum is a building which dares to project its own special image, an image that gains in strength from its interaction with the landscape.\\" And \\"Bouman’s innovation rests on his insight in recognising that the asymmetrical composition of Utzon’s Opera House could be translated into a series of parallel vaults.\\".

During this time, Feiko Bouman carried out and built many major transformative works in the municipality. The Council selected Bouman’s firm from several other submissions, primarily based upon the design quality of, The Stockman’s Hall of Fame. John Haskell, architectural critic, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald, has described this contribution as \\"conferred a distinctive visual identity on North Sydney...and...refreshingly free of fads and fashion\\". The Civic Centre project started modestly; repairing a vacant site next to the Council Chambers, providing a dedicated park and other community facilities. Later the distinctive Civic Centre Offices and LibraryProfessor John Haskell, \\"North Sydney discovers its own Wren\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1989 were built. Around that time, progressively, seven major new buildings were designed and constructed, at North Sydney Oval.John Haskell, \\"North Sydney Oval\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 18 March 1987 The spaces underneath the new stands were used for income-producing activities, including, a colonnade of shops, office space, function rooms and child care centre. Creative modern use of steelwork featured strongly in these buildings, as it would in many other Bouman designs. A child-care centre project in Crows NestPhilip Drew, \\"Mother Cylinder\\", Architecture Bulletin, August edition 1988 was another innovative project, which has an earth/grass covered roof, publicly accessible and contributes to parkland in the area. It is very energy efficient.\\"North Sydney ... first in child care design\\", The Northern Herald, 16 June 1988 Manly Civic Centre and Library Manly Civic Centre and LibraryThe Library building was designed as the first stage of a major redevelopment, on a very restricted and isolated site. It initiated a revitalisation of the area and resolves some complex planning problems. Penrith Civic Centre and Library Penrith Civic Centre and LibraryPenrith is the centre of a fast-growing area, west of Sydney, rapidly becoming a place of regional significance. Council operated from 4 separate buildings and there was an obvious need to centralise its activities. The completed complex has a strong presence, intended to express developing confidence. Elizabeth Farrelly, in the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote ... \\"people who work in the Civic Centre lyricise over the sense of endless discovery it brings, and the bytes of surprise visual joy.\\". She also poses the interesting question ...\\"Can a building, especially a public building, be liked-loved even-by all inhabitants and not be good architecture?\\"E M Farrelly. \\"Penrith defies the westie cringe\\".

This “marriage” between the square and the circle is the theme of a great number of mankind’s most significant buildings in the East and West...a remarkable contemporary example\\" Feiko Bouman, Urban Peasant, Austin Macauley London, 2018 Steel Treehouse, Killcare Beach Steel Treehouse, Killcare BeachThe overriding approach of the design, was to have minimal impact on the natural beauty of the site. It is virtually a treehouse, constructed on a central core, with large cantilevers extending from the centre. Steel construction is very appropriate for a bushfire-prone area and is further enhanced through the specific roof design. Conventional gutters have been eliminated; through the device of the major curved roof forms, directly flowing onto a “flat” tapered tray system, allowing positive water and leaf run-off, into just one large downpipe, which empties into a grated sump. There are three connected “pavilions” for balance between communal and private areas.E M Farrelly, \\"Penrith defies the westie cringe\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 17 October 1995 ==Books== # # - Dutch translation of Urban Peasant # ==Articles in the media== # John Lahey, \\"Opera House of the Outback\\", The Age, 31 July 1987 # John Haskell, \\"North Sydney Oval\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 18 March 1987 # Professor John Haskell, \\"North Sydney discovers its own Wren\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1989 # Philip Drew, \\"Outback Cathedral\\", Architecture Bulletin, August edition 1988 # Philip Drew, \\"Mother Cylinder\\", Architecture Bulletin, August edition 1988 # \\"North Sydney ... first in child care design\\", The Northern Herald, 16 June 1988 # Peter Ward, \\"Robust Penrith Civic Centre\\", The Weekend Australian, 16–17 April 1994 # E M Farrelly, \\"Penrith defies the westie cringe\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 17 October 1995 # Gwenda Edwards, \\"The Greenhouse effect/Killcare\\", The Daily Telegraph, 6 February 1999 # Jenny Wills, \\"Dutch courage\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 31 August 2003 ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:20th- century Australian architects Category:21st-century Australian architects Category:New South Wales architects ","title":"Feiko Bouman"},{"id":"56563649","text":"The Kids in the Shoe is a 1935 short animated film produced by Max Fleischer.

Curiously enough, all of the children look identical with the exception of the youngest child, whom the woman tends to personally. It is shown that the children are rebellious by nature, purposefully giving their meals to the cat and avoiding their combing and teeth brushing. \\"For wasting your broth and bread, it's off to bed!\\" yells the woman to the kids. After the children are sent to sleep, they begin a rowdy song and the situation becomes happy but highly chaotic. The woman later wakes up and threatens them to feed them castor oil if they don't go to sleep, which they happily comply with.

These include agglutinativity, a rich array of noun classes, extensive inflection for person (both subject and object), tense, aspect and mood, and generally a subject–verb–object word order. == Typology == Swahili may be described in several ways depending on the aspect being considered. * It is an agglutinative language. It constructs whole words by joining together discrete roots and morphemes with specific meanings, and may also modify words by similar processes. * Its basic word order is SVO. However, because the verb is inflected to indicate the subject and sometimes also the object, this order may be changed to emphasise certain parts of the sentence. * It has no grammatical case marking on the noun. Nominal roles are indicated by a combination of word order and agreement markers on the verb, with no change to the nouns themselves. * It has a complex grammatical gender system, but as this does not include a distinction based on natural sex, the term \\"noun class\\" is generally used instead of \\"gender\\". * It has head-first order with few exceptions. * It is a pro-drop language. Verbs may be used without explicitly specifying the subject or the object with substantives (nouns or pronouns). ==Nouns== Noun classes Swahili nouns are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns wasichana \\"girls\\" and wasimamizi \\"overseers\\" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix wa-, whereas kifuniko \\"lid, cover\\" and kisukari \\"diabetes\\" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix ki-. The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12 and 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties). When discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) morphological noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) syntactic noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, \\"noun class\\" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by m-wa. For more information, see concord. The following noun classes exist: {  ! Class ! Prefix before consonant ! Prefix before vowel ! Example - ! 1  m-1  mw-1  mtu \\"person\\" - ! 2  wa-  w(a)-2  watu \\"people\\" - ! 3  m-1  mw-1  mti \\"tree\\" - ! 4  mi-  my-  miti \\"trees\\" - ! 5  (ji-)3  (j-)3  jicho \\"eye\\" - ! 6  ma-  ma-4  macho \\"eyes\\" - ! 7  ki-  ch-/ki-5  kitabu \\"book\\" - ! 8  vi-  vy-/vi-5  vitabu \\"books\\" - ! 9  n-6  ny-  simba \\"lion\\" - ! 10  n-6  ny-  simba \\"lions\\", funguo \\"keys\\" - ! 11  u-  u-/uw-/w-7  ufunguo \\"key\\" - ! 14  u-  u-/uw-/w-7  utu \\"humanity\\" - ! 15  ku-  ku-/kw-8  kula \\"eating, consuming\\" - ! 16  rowspan=\\"3\\"  -9  rowspan=\\"3\\"  -9  rowspan=\\"3\\"  mahali \\"place\\" - !17 - !18 } # This m- before a consonant is always syllabic /m̩/, even when the following consonant is b or v, as in mvulana \\"boy\\" [m̩.vu.ˈlɑ(ː).nɑ]. The mw- before a vowel, however, is not syllabic, as in mwalimu \\"teacher\\" [mwɑ.ˈli(ː).mu]. When the stem is only one syllable, the prefix takes the stress, as in mtu \\"person\\" [ˈm̩.tu]. Before a stem beginning with u, the prefix may appear as either mw- or mu-, as in mwuguzi / muuguzi \\"nurse\\". A few nouns, mostly loans, have mu- before a consonant, such as muziki \\"music\\", musuli \\"muscle\\" and muda \\"length of time\\" (although mziki, msuli and mda are also widespread variations). In class 3, the w is frequently absent before o as in moyo \\"heart\\" (plural: mioyo), moto \\"fire\\" (plural: mioto) and moshi \\"smoke\\". # Wa- is often present only as w- when the stem begins with /a/ as in wanafunzi \\"students\\" (singular: mwanafunzi). A following i may merge with the a of this prefix, forming we- as in wezi \\"thieves\\" (singular: mwizi). The a in this prefix is generally preserved in nouns which are derived from verbs, such as waandishi \\"writer\\" (singular: mwandishi, from the verb -andika \\"to write\\"), as well as those derived from proper nouns, such as Waafrika \\"Africans\\" (singular: Mwafrika) and Waislamu \\"Muslims\\" (singular: Mwislamu) # The ji- prefix occurs on nouns with monosyllabic stems, such as jiwe \\"stone\\" (plural: mawe), but is absent from longer words. This is not to be confused with the augmentative prefix ji-, which is not dropped in the plural, for example jiji \\"large town, city\\" (plural: majiji, from mji \\"town\\"). Some nouns may also simply have stems which start with ji- such as jina \\"name\\" (plural: majina). Some words whose stems begin with a vowel take the prefix j-, such as jambo \\"thing, affair\\" (plural: mambo) but others do not, such as azimio \\"resolution\\" (plural: maazimio). # The prefix ma- may merge with a following i to become me- as in meno \\"teeth\\" (singular: jino). # The prefixes ki- and vi- may sometimes appear before vowels, such as in kiazi \\"potato\\" (plural: viazi) rather than the possibly expected *chazi and *vyazi. It is possible to regard the stem of these words as beginning with the i (e.g. -iazi) as adjectives beginning with i simply take k- and v- prefixes in these classes. # The n of the prefix is a prenasalising mutation of the following consonant and is never syllabic unless the noun would otherwise only have one syllable. It becomes m before b and v. In stems beginning with w such as -wili \\"two\\", this mutates to mb. Before vowels it is present as ny. Before d, z, j and g it is n. L and r become nd. Before other consonants, it disappears unless it needs to be syllabic to prevent the noun from having only one syllable, such as in nchi \\"country, land\\". The plural form of class 11 nouns is formed this way, dropping the u- and then applying these rules (for example ulimi → ndimi \\"tongue\\" → \\"tongues\\", ukuta → kuta \\"wall\\" → \\"walls\\"), except that short nouns with a monosyllabic stem preserve the u- in the plural for reasons of stress, adding ny- before it to form the plural, such as uso \\"face\\", which becomes nyuso in the plural. # The u- prefix has some variation in spelling and pronunciation before vowels. # The ku- prefix becomes kw- only before a minority of stems: kwenda \\"to go\\" and kwisha \\"to finish\\". # The locative classes of nouns no longer have their original pa-, ku-, m(u)-prefixes in Swahili, with these only appearing on adjectives, demonstratives and other parts of the grammar. Most nouns form their locative form by adding the suffix -ni although this cannot be added to geographical place names, many recent loans and certain other words. Every class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 mtu \\"person\\" is class 2 watu \\"people\\". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example ugonjwa \\"sickness, disease\\", magonjwa \\"diseases\\". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as maji \\"water\\", and other nouns derived from verbs such as mazungumzo \\"conversation(s)\\". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as mchana \\"afternoon(s)\\", \\"daytime\\" (class 3), vita \\"war(s)\\" (class 8), usiku \\"night(s)\\" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context. In terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.  Concord  The class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called agreement or concord. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed \\"concords\\" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively. {   colspan=\\"7\\" Class 1/2: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Mwanaume mkubwa alianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Wanaume wakubwa walianguka. - mwanaume m-kubwa a-li-anguk(a) wanaume wa-kubwa wa-li- anguk(a) - (CL1)man CL1-big CL1-PST-fall (CL2)men CL2-big CL2-PST-fall - \\"man\\" \\"big\\" \\"s/he-fell\\" \\"men\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big man fell.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big men fell.\\" } {  -  colspan=\\"7\\" Class 7/8: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Kitabu kikubwa kilianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Vitabu vikubwa vilianguka. - kitabu ki-kubwa ki-li-anguk(a) vitabu vi-kubwa vi-li-anguk(a) - (CL7)book CL7-big CL7-PST-fall (CL8)books CL8-big CL8-PST-fall - \\"book\\" \\"big\\" \\"it-fell\\" \\"books\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big book fell.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big books fell.\\" } {  -  colspan=\\"7\\" Class 11/10: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Uso mzuri unatosha.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Nyuso nzuri zinatosha. - uso m-zuri u-na- tosh(a) nyuso n-zuri zi-na-tosh(a) - (CL11)face CL11-beautiful CL11-PRES-be.enough (CL10)faces CL10-beautiful CL10-PRES-be.enough - \\"face\\" \\"beautiful\\" \\"it-is-enough\\" \\"faces\\" \\"beautiful\\" \\"they-are-enough\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"A beautiful face is enough.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Beautiful faces are enough.\\" } Animate nouns (i.e. those referring to people or animals) which are not in classes 1/2 generally take the agreement prefixes (concords) from classes 1/2 as if they did belong to it. {   colspan=\\"7\\" Class 7/8 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Kifaru mkubwa alianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Vifaru wakubwa walianguka. - kifaru m-kubwa a-li-anguk(a) vifaru wa-kubwa wa-li-anguk(a) - (CL7)rhinoceros CL1-big CL1-PST-fall (CL8)rhinoceroses CL2-big CL2-PST-fall - \\"rhinoceros\\" \\"big\\" \\"s/he-fell\\" \\"rhinoceroses\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big rhinoceros fell.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big rhinoceroses fell.\\" } Animacy agreements can often distinguish different meanings of the same noun, such as ndege, which means \\"bird(s)\\" when animate and \\"aeroplane(s)\\" when inanimate. {   colspan=\\"7\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ndege mkubwa alianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ndege wakubwa walianguka. - ndege m-kubwa a-li-anguk(a) ndege wa-kubwa wa-li-anguk(a) - (CL9)bird CL1-big CL1-PST-fall (CL10)birds CL2-big CL2-PST-fall - \\"bird\\" \\"big\\" \\"s/he-fell\\" \\"birds\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big bird fell.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big birds fell.\\" } {   colspan=\\"7\\" Class 9/10 Inanimate: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ndege kubwa ilianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ndege kubwa zilianguka. - ndege N-kubwa i-li-anguk(a) ndege N-kubwa zi-li-anguk(a) - (CL9)bird CL9-big CL9-PST-fall (CL10)birds CL10-big CL10-PST-fall - \\"bird\\" \\"big\\" \\"it-fell\\" \\"birds\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big plane fell.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The big planes fell.\\" } Animate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight aberration from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms -angu, -ako, -ake, -etu, -enu and -ao are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving yangu, yako, yetu etc. in singular and zangu, zako, zetu etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition -a (giving ya in singular and za in plural), however for most speakers wa is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception. {   colspan=\\"9\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Mama yetu mkubwa alianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"4\\" Mama zetu wakubwa walianguka. - mama y-etu m-kubwa a-li- anguk(a) mama z-etu wa-kubwa wa-li-anguk(a) - (CL9)mother CL9-GEN.1P CL1-big CL1-PST-fall (CL10)mothers CL10-GEN.1P CL2-big CL2-PST-fall - \\"mother\\" \\"our\\" \\"big\\" \\"s/he-fell\\" \\"mothers\\" \\"our\\" \\"big\\" \\"they-fell\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"Our (older maternal) aunt fell.\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"Our (older maternal) aunts fell.\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" Note: The phrase mama mkubwa, literally \\"big mother\\", refers to the elder sister of one's mother. } {   colspan=\\"11\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Baba yangu wa kambo alianguka.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"5\\" Baba zangu wa kambo walianguka. - baba y-angu w-a kambo a-li-anguk(a) baba z-angu w-a kambo wa-li-anguk(a) - (CL9)father CL9-GEN.1S CL1-GEN non.blood.relationship CL1-PST-fall (CL10)fathers CL10-GEN.1S CL2-GEN non.blood.relationship CL2-PST-fall - \\"father\\" \\"my\\" \\"of\\" \\"non-blood relationship\\" \\"s/he fell\\" \\"fathers\\" \\"my\\" \\"of\\" \\"non-blood relationship\\" \\"they fell\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"My stepfather fell.\\"  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"My stepfathers fell.\\" } Nouns which follow this pattern of agreement include mama \\"mother(s)\\", baba \\"father(s)\\", ndugu \\"sibling(s)/relative(s)\\", kaka \\"(elder) brother(s)\\", dada \\"(elder) sister(s)\\", nyanya \\"grandmother(s)\\", bibi \\"grandmother(s)\\", babu \\"grandfather(s)\\", shangazi \\"paternal aunt(s)\\", shemeji \\"sister(s)/brother(s)-in-law\\", wifi \\"sister(s)-in-law\\", jamaa \\"relative(s)\\", rafiki \\"friend(s)\\", shoga \\"female friend of a woman\\", jirani \\"neighbour\\" and adui \\"enemy\\". Nouns of this group, such as rafiki \\"friend\\", may optionally take a plural prefix ma- as though belonging to class 5/6, although their concords remain the same mix of class 1/2 and 9/10. {   colspan=\\"9\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Rafiki yangu anaishi hapa.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"4\\" (Ma)rafiki zangu wanaishi hapa. - rafiki y-angu a-na-ishi hapa (ma)-rafiki z-angu wa-na-ishi hapa - (CL9)friend CL9-GEN.1S CL1-PRES-live here (PL.CL6)-(CL10)friend CL10-GEN.1S CL1-PRES-live here - \\"friend\\" \\"my\\" \\"s/he-lives\\" \\"here\\" \\"friends\\" \\"my\\" \\"they-live\\" \\"here\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"My friend lives here.\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"My friends live here.\\" } In addition, animals of classes 9/10 generally take class 1 agreement throughout the singular, but may take 10 agreement on pronominal genitive words in the plural. {   colspan=\\"7\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ng'ombe wetu amekufa.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ng'ombe zetu wamekufa. - ng'ombe w-etu a-me-ku-f(a) ng'ombe z-etu wa-me-ku-f(a) - (CL9)cow CL1-GEN.1P CL1-PRF-EXT-die (CL10)cows CL10-GEN.1P CL2-PRF-EXT-die - \\"cow\\" \\"our\\" \\"s/he-has-died\\" \\"cows\\" \\"our\\" \\"they-have-died\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Our cow is dead.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Our cows are dead.\\" } {   colspan=\\"9\\" Class 9/10 Animate: - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Rafiki yangu anaishi hapa.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"4\\" (Ma)rafiki zangu wanaishi hapa. - rafiki y-angu a-na-ishi hapa (ma)-rafiki z-angu wa-na-ishi hapa - (CL9)friend CL9-GEN.1S CL1-PRES-live here (PL.CL6)-(CL10)friend CL10-GEN.1S CL1-PRES-live here - \\"friend\\" \\"my\\" \\"s/he-lives\\" \\"here\\" \\"friends\\" \\"my\\" \\"they-live\\" \\"here\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"My friend lives here.\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"My friends live here.\\" } Another departure from the rule of animate nouns taking concords in classes 1/2 occurs on occasion with diminutives and augmentatives, whereby using concords of the class the noun belongs to (5/6 for augmentatives, 7/8 for diminutives) emphasises the diminution or augmentation. {   colspan=\\"4\\" Class 1 (neutral):   colspan=\\"4\\" Class 7 (diminutive): - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Mpenzi wake anaishi hapa.  rowspan=\\"4\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"4\\" Kipenzi chake kinaishi hapa. - mpenzi w-ake a-na-ishi hapa kipenzi ch-ake ki-na-ishi hapa - (CL1)lover CL1-GEN.3S CL1-PRES-live here (CL7)lover CL7-GEN.3S CL7-PRES-live here -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"His/her boyfriend/girlfriend/lover lives here.\\"  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"His/her sweetheart/darling lives here.\\" } Locative classes A locative noun is a derived noun that indicate a location associated with the base noun from which it is derived. The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as \\"in\\", \\"at\\", \\"on\\", \\"to\\" or \\"from\\", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb. The Arabic loan noun mahali \\"place\\" (and its variations: pahali, mahala and pahala) is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix -ni to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns. Because locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on pa- and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on ku- indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on mu- and indicates internal location. * nyumba ya Rehema \\"Rehema's house\\" (class 9) * nyumbani kwa Rehema \\"at/to/from Rehema's house\\" (class 17) * chumba cha Daudi \\"Daudi's room\\" (class 7) * chumbani mwa Daudi \\"in/into/out of Daudi's room\\" (class 18)  Apposition and compounding  The equivalent of compound words is usually formed using the genitive construction such as mpira wa kikapu \\"basketball\\" (literally \\"ball of basket\\"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French fin de semaine \\"weekend\\" (literally \\"end of week\\"). There are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition -a. In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side. The word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes what it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun punda \\"donkey(s)\\" is followed by the class 4 noun milia \\"stripes\\" to mean \\"zebra\\". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: \\"stripe-donkey\\", the word for \\"donkey\\" appears first in Swahili. There is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for \\"zebra(s)\\" may appear as any of pundamilia, punda-milia or punda milia. A few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word mwanamke \\"woman\\" becomes wanawake \\"women\\" in plural. Similarly, mwanamume \\"man\\" becomes wanaume \\"men\\" in plural, although the singular form mwanaume is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word mwana \\"son, daughter\\", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean \\"person\\", followed by the words mke \\"wife\\" (plural: wake) and mume \\"husband\\" (plural: waume) respectively. ==Pronouns== Pronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between we and us, which are both sisi. Personal pronouns Personal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as na \\"with, and\\" and ndi- \\"it is\\". The independent form consists, in all cases except for wao, of a reduplication of a syllable. Nyinyi, however, may alternatively be dissimilated to ninyi. These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added. {  ! Class ! Independent ! Combining suffix ! Genitive suffix !\\"all\\" - ! 1st sing.  mimi  -mi  -angu -- - ! 2nd sing.  wewe  -we  -ako -- - ! 3rd sing.  yeye  -ye  -ake -- - ! 1st plur.  sisi  -si  -etu (sisi) sote - ! 2nd plur.  nyinyi, ninyi  -nyi  -enu (nyinyi) nyote - ! 3rd plur.  wao  -o  -ao (wao) wote } Note that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with yeye capable of meaning either \\"he\\" or \\"she\\". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean it. The genitive form -ake has no such restriction and may mean \\"his\\", \\"hers\\" or \\"its\\" depending on context. Swahili is a pro-drop language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula ni (or its negative counterpart si) is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes. In informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as mi or mie for mimi. This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. mi ni \\"I am\\", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix ni- is dropped in casual speech before -na-. For example, standard (mimi) ninajua \\"I know\\" often occurs as (mi) najua in spoken Swahili. == Determiners == Determiners in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs. Articles There are no articles in Swahili. A word such as kitabu \\"book\\" may be taken to mean either \\"the book\\" or \\"a book\\" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as kitabu hicho \\"that (aforementioned) book\\", kitabu kimoja \\"one book\\", kitabu fulani \\"some (particular) book\\", kitabu chochote \\"any book (at all)\\". Demonstrative The demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types: * Proximal (\\"this, these\\"), referring to something near the speaker. It is formed by prefixing the verbal concord with hV- where \\"V\\" stands for a vowel identical to the vowel of the next syllable. * Distal (\\"that, those\\"), referring to something far from both speaker and listener. It is formed by suffixing -le to the verbal concord. * Medial/Referential (\\"the aforementioned\\"), referring to something that has been previously mentioned. It may also refer to something nearer to the listener than the speaker. It is formed by replacing the final vowel of the proximal demonstrative with the o (with consonant changes such as ki becoming ch etc.). There is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as na and ndi-. This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class. {  ! Class ! Proximal ! Distal ! Medial / Referential !Combining - ! 1  huyu  yule  huyo -ye - ! 2  hawa  wale  hao -o - ! 3  huu  ule  huo -o - ! 4  hii  ile  hiyo -yo - ! 5  hili  lile  hilo -lo - ! 6  haya  yale  hayo -yo - ! 7  hiki  kile  hicho -cho - ! 8  hivi  vile  hivyo -vyo - ! 9  hii  ile  hiyo -yo - ! 10  hizi  zile  hizo -zo - ! 11  huu  ule  huo -o - ! 14  huu  ule  huo -o - ! 15  huku  kule  huko -ko - ! 16  hapa  pale  hapo -po - ! 17  huku  kule  huko -ko - ! 18  humu  mle  humo -mo } The demonstratives may stand alone, as true pronouns, but may also be used in combination with a noun, much like \\"this\\" and \\"that\\" in English. The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article- like role.  Other determiners  The words -ote \\"all\\", -o-ote \\"any\\", -pi \\"which\\" and -enyewe \\"-self\\", \\"-selves\\", appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, -o-ote was frequently written as two words (e.g. ye yote, vyo vyote) however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions -a and -enye as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form. {  ! ! colspan=\\"4\\" Determiners ! colspan=\\"2\\" Prepositions !Verbal Prefix - !

These may be used with or without the pronoun: sisi sote or simply sote can mean \\"all of us\\", \\"we all\\". When used with the form wote, the meaning is \\"both\\": sisi wote \\"both of us\\", \\"we both\\". # The irregular form wepi is used to avoid clashes with the word wapi meaning \\"where\\". # The word vipi may be used to ask \\"which\\" of class 8 nouns (e.g. vitabu vipi? \\"which books?\\"), but, as is typical for class 8, can also be understood adverbially, following a verb to mean \\"how?\\". # The usual word for \\"where\\" or \\"which place\\" is wapi, however some sources list a regular form papi. ==Adjectives== The term \\"adjective\\", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as \\"true adjectives\\" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: inflecting adjectives, which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and invariable adjectives, which do not take a prefix. All adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used: * Inflecting adjectives are true adjectives which are prefixed with an adjective concord. * Plain adjectives are true adjectives which do not take concord prefixes. * Relatives are relativised verbs which can be used as adjectives. * Genitives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the genitive preposition -a. * Ornatives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the ornative preposition -enye. Inflecting Adjectives Inflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal u- prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival m- prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to. Most inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either e (for example, -ekundu \\"red\\") or i (e.g. -ingi \\"many, much\\"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: -ovu \\"evil, wicked\\", which is mwovu in class 1 and waovu in class 2. {  ! ! colspan=\\"3\\" Nominally prefixed - !

On adjectives with stems of more than one syllable, it only appears as a prenasalisation of the following consonants: b → mb, d → nd, g → ng, j → nj, l → nd, r → nd, v → mv, w → mb, z → nz. Elsewhere, it disappears. In addition, the monosyllabic adjective stem -pya \\"new\\" has the form mpya, whereby the m- constitutes the stressed syllable. # The adjective -ema \\"good, kind, nice\\" has the irregular form njema in class 9 and 10 instead of the expected form *nyema. # In modern standard Swahili, adjectives in class 14 take the prefix m(w)-, however, in an earlier stage of the language, they took the prefix u-/w- which is still preserved in some idiomatic phrases but has otherwise disappeared, marking the almost complete merge of classes 11 and 14. The adjective -ingine \\"other\\", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms lingine in class six, ingine or yingine in class 9 and zingine in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes: jengine, lengine, nyengine, yengine and zengine sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are jingine for class 6 and nyingine for classes 9 and 10. The numerals -moja \\"one\\", -wili \\"two\\", -tatu \\"three\\", -nne \\"four\\", -tano \\"five\\" and -nane \\"eight\\", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. * mtu mmoja \\"one person\\", watu wawili \\"two people\\", watu ishirini na mmoja \\"twenty-one people\\", watu ishirini na wawili \\"twenty- two people\\" * kitabu kimoja \\"one book\\", vitabu viwili \\"two books\\", vitabu ishirini na kimoja \\"twenty-one books\\", vitabu ishirini na viwili \\"twenty-two books\\" * nyumba moja \\"one house\\", nyumba mbili \\"two houses\\", nyumba ishirini na moja \\"twenty-one houses\\", nyumba ishirini na mbili \\"twenty-two houses\\"  Invariable adjectives  Invariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as safi \\"clean\\", ghali \\"expensive\\", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as faini, from English \\"fine\\". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as msichana kiziwi \\"Deaf girl\\", which has a class 1 prefix m- and a class 7 prefix ki-. Numbers loaned from Arabic: sita \\"six\\", saba \\"seven\\" and tisa \\"nine\\", ishirini \\"twenty\\", etc., as well as the native Bantu number kumi \\"ten\\", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective gani \\"what kind of\\" or, colloquially, \\"which\\" is also invariable. * watu tisa \\"nine people\\" * vitabu tisa \\"nine books\\" * nyumba tisa \\"nine houses\\" Relatives Relatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class. {  !

For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives \\"open\\" and \\"dead\\", however the verbs kufa \\"to die\\" and kufunguliwa \\"to be opened\\", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use: * ndege aliyekufa \\"dead bird\\" (bird which died) * ndege waliokufa \\"dead birds\\" (birds which died) * mlango uliofunguliwa \\"open door\\" (door which was opened) * milango iliyofunguliwa \\"open doors\\" (doors which were opened) * dirisha lililofunguliwa \\"open window\\" (window which was opened) * madirisha yaliyofunguliwa \\"open windows\\" (windows which were opened) Genitive adjectives Another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the genitive preposition -a. The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined here. In many cases, the noun introduced in a genitive adjective phrase receives an additional ki- prefix, such as -a kimataifa \\"international\\" (from mataifa \\"nations\\") and -a kihistoria \\"historic\\" (from historia \\"history\\"). Ornative construction Yet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the ornative construction using -enye. Some examples of adjectival phrases with -enye include -enye nguvu \\"strong\\" (with strength), -enye nywele fupi \\"short-haired\\" (having short hair), and -enye senta moja \\"concentric\\" (having one centre). The forms of -enye as well as some more examples of use can be seen here. ==Verbs== Like nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, tense, aspect, mood and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as -sema \\"say\\", -andika \\"to write\\", -la \\"to eat\\". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with ku- or, for a couple of verbs only, kw-, such as kusema \\"to say\\", kuandika \\"to write\\", kula \\"to eat\\". Overview of verb structure Prefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE. * Subject prefix * TAM prefix (or usually Tense prefix) * Relative prefix * Object prefix * Verb stem * Extension(s) (meaning \\"derivative suffix(es)\\"), or, more broadly Ending (including also the inflectional suffixes -i and -e). In learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as infixes. It should, however, be noted that the term infix, as used by linguists, refers only to a morpheme (≈ part of a word) that is inserted within another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes. Here is an example of a verb with all slots filled: {   colspan=\\"6\\" nilipokupikia - !S !T !R !O !V !E - ni- -li- -po- -ku- -pik(a)* -i(a)* - 1S-  -PST-  -CL16.REL-  -2S-  -cook  -APPL - \\"I\\" \\"earlier\\" \\"when\\" \\"you\\" \\"cook\\" \\"for\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"when I cooked for you\\" } * This \\"(a)\\" appears when this is the final element of the word and is otherwise dropped. Most of the time, verbs will not have all slots filled. Here are some other examples. {   colspan=\\"6\\" anakupenda - !S !T !R !O !V !E - a- -na- -- -ku- -pend(a) -- - 3S-  -PRS- --  -2S-  -love -- - \\"s/he\\" \\"now\\" -- \\"you\\" \\"love\\" -- -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"s/he loves you\\" } {   colspan=\\"6\\" nipe - !S !T !R !O !V !E - -- -- -- -ni- -p(a)* -e - -- -- --  -1S-  -give-  -SBJV - -- -- -- \\"me\\" \\"give\\" \\"should/must\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"give me\\" } {   colspan=\\"6\\" hatuwezi - !S !T !R !O !V !E - hatu- -- -- -- -wez(a) -i - NEG.1P- -- -- --  -be.able  -NEG.PRES -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"we cannot\\" / \\"we are unable\\" - \\"not we\\" -- -- -- \\"can\\" \\"not now\\" } {   colspan=\\"8\\" hawalishwi - !S !T !R !O !V !E !E !E - hawa- -- -- -- -l(a) -ish(a) -w(a) -i - NEG.3P- -- -- --  -eat  -CAUS  -PASS  -NEG.PRES - \\"not they\\" -- -- -- \\"eat\\" \\"make\\" \\"be done\\" \\"not now\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" \\"they do not get fed\\" } There are a number of derivational suffixes (frequently termed 'extensions') which can be added to the end of verbs to derive new meanings, some of which have been shown above. Inflection groups There are three basic inflection groups which differ only very slightly from one another: # common verbs # short verbs # loan verbs Common verbs are the largest group of verbs in Swahili. In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with -a. All verbs of native Bantu origin end with -a, including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are kuanguka \\"to fall\\", kufanya \\"to do, to make\\", kuona \\"to see\\", kuwaza \\"to think\\", kusaidia \\"to help\\". The final -a is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming -i in the present negative, and -e in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker -ni also triggers this final -a to become -e. Short verbs are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as kula \\"to eat\\", kunywa \\"to drink\\", kuja \\"to come\\", kupa \\"to give\\". The verbs kwenda \\"to go\\" and kwisha \\"to finish\\" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as kuenda and kuisha). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix ku- is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed monosyllabic verbs, however this is problematic as the final -a of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as -p- \\"give\\"). Furthermore, when the final -a is considered part of the stem, this excludes -enda and -isha, which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in -a and undergo the same -i and -e alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable -ku- in certain verb forms. This intrusive -ku- (which may be glossed as EXT for \\"extension\\") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain TAM prefixes (-na-, -me-, -li-, -ta-, -sha-, -nge-, -ngeli-) and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This -ku- disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (-a-, hu-, -ki-, -ka-, -ku-, -si-). (The TAM prefix -ja- can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of -enda and -isha takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their -kw- extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the -ku- extension in other short verbs. The Loan verbs, also frequently called \\"Arabic\\" verbs, are those which do not end in -a in the infinitive. Not all verbs from Arabic are in this group, however, such as kusaidia, which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in -a and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as kukisi \\"to kiss\\" and kuripoti \\"to report\\", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in -a. The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes -e and -i that the verbs ending in -a do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in si- ku-sahau- ~~Ø~~ which could either mean \\"I did not forget\\" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST- forget- ~~Ø~~ ) or \\"I do not forget you\\" (NEG.1s-2s-forget- ~~PRES.NEG~~ ). Subject and object concords Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by prefixes or concords attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis. Six different forms of verbal concord exist. For the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ha- to the beginning, except for the irregular forms si- (instead of *hani-), hu- (instead of *hau-) and ha- (instead of *haa-) which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects. Additionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix yu- is used instead of a- as the subject of a locative copula. (This yu- can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of yu- is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ha-. Before the present 'indefinite' marker -a-, subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition -a. Object concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord. {  ! ! colspan=\\"4\\" Positive ! colspan=\\"2\\" Negative - !

Very frequently, however, the suffix -eni is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ninawaoneni \\"I see you all.\\" This suffix causes the final a of Bantu verbs to shift to e. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply -ni. Some speakers use the prefix -ku- (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix -(e)ni, as in ninakuoneni \\"I see you all.\\" The reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like myself, yourself, himself and so on. * ninajitetea \\"I defend myself\\" * anajiona \\"he sees himself\\" (idiomatically, may mean: \\"he is conceited\\") Infinitive The infinitive is a verbal noun, and belongs to the nominal class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix ku-. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix -ni, as in kuangukani \\"in falling\\" (i.e. \\"while falling\\"). It corresponds to the English infinitive or gerund. Infinitives cannot take subject, relative or TAM prefixes, but they may take object prefixes. {  + Formation of the infinitive  !common verbs !short verbs !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Affirmative  ku___a ku___a ku___ - ku[OBJ]___a ku[OBJ]___a ku[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Negative  kuto(ku)___a kutoku___a kuto(ku)___ - kuto(ku)[OBJ]___a kuto(ku)[OBJ]___a kuto(ku)[OBJ]___ } The negative infinitive is derived from the verb kutoa \\"to subtract\\", \\"to not do\\", although it is rarely encountered in its full form for this use. The additional -ku- in brackets is the infinitive marker of the original verb, although it may be omitted as long as stress rules allow. {  + Examples - ! Verb ! Affirmative infinitive !

All together, Tense, Aspect and Mood may be abbreviated as TAM. The following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \\"short\\" and \\"common verbs\\", with \\"loan verbs\\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the -ni suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this -(e)ni prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table. {  + Summary of TAM forms ! !Tense, Aspect, Mood !Subject !TAM !Relative !Object / Extension !Verb STEM !Final Vowel !2P !Relative -  rowspan=\\"10\\" Indicative Basic Tenses Past SUB -li- (REL) (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Past Negative  _NEG_.SUB -ku- -- (OBJ) STEM -a -- -- - Perfect SUB -me- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Perfect Negative  _NEG_.SUB -ja- -- (OBJ) / (EXT) STEM -a -- -- - Present 'Definite' SUB -na- (REL) (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Present 'Indefinite'  _SUB*_ -a- -- (OBJ) STEM -a -- -- - Present Habitual -- hu- -- (OBJ) STEM -a -- -- - Present Negative  _NEG_.SUB -- -- (OBJ) STEM -i -- -- - Future SUB -ta- (-ka-REL) (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Future Negative  _NEG_.SUB -ta- / -to- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Relative Forms Tenseless Relative SUB -- -- (OBJ) STEM -a- -- REL - Tenseless Negative Relative SUB  -si- REL (OBJ) STEM  -a -- -- -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Contextual Tenses Situational SUB  -ki- -- (OBJ) STEM -a -- -- - Consecutive SUB  -ka- -- (OBJ) STEM -a -- -- -  rowspan=\\"6\\" Irrealis Irrealis Present SUB  -nge- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Irrealis Present Negative 1 SUB  -singe- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Irrealis Present Negative 2  _NEG_.SUB  -nge- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Irrealis Past SUB  -ngali- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Irrealis Past Negative 1 SUB  -singali- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- - Irrealis Past Negative 2  _NEG_.SUB  -ngali- -- (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -- -  rowspan=\\"5\\" Imperatives and Subjunctives Imperative Singular (- OBJ) -- -- -- -- / EXT STEM  -a -- -- - Imperative Singular + OBJ -- -- -- OBJ STEM  -e -- -- - Imperative Plural -- -- -- (OBJ) STEM  -e-  -ni -- - Subjunctive SUB -- -- (OBJ) STEM -e -- -- - Subjunctive Negative SUB -si- -- (OBJ) STEM -e -- -- -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Expeditive Imperatives and Subjunctives Expeditive Subjunctive SUB  -ka- -- (OBJ) STEM -e -- -- - Exp.

It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ji-) causes the final -a of Bantu verbs to become -e. Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \\"to learn\\" is jifunz _e_ \\"learn!\\" and not *jifunza. {  + Formation of the imperative  !Common verbs !Short verbs !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Singular ___a ku___a ___ - [OBJ]___e [OBJ]___e [OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Plural ___eni ku___eni ___ni - [OBJ]___eni [OBJ]___eni [OBJ]___ni } The plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people. The following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite: * kuja \\"to come\\": njoo (pl. njooni) * kwenda \\"to go\\" : nenda (pl. nendeni) * kuleta \\"to bring\\": lete (pl. leteni) The verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni). Additionally, the verb kuwa \\"to be\\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\\"polite imperative\\") form: uwe (pl. mwe). {  + Examples (singular then plural) - !

The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here. {  +Examples (singular then plural) - ! Verb ! Alone !

Msinijibu! \\"Don't answer me!\\" - !-jifunza N/A Usijifunze! Msijifunze! \\"Don't learn!\\" } =Present tenses= There are two present tenses in Swahili. These are sometimes termed the \\"definite present\\" (with -na-) and the \\"indefinite present\\" (with -a-). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \\"indefinite present\\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines. A distinction between these two forms is not made in the negative, with both forms being negated the same way. {  + Formation of the present tense -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  \\"definite present\\"  [SUBJ]na___a  [SUBJ]naku___a [SUBJ]na___ - [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" \\"indefinite present\\" (almost obsolete) [SUBJ*]a___a [SUBJ*]a___a [SUBJ*]a___ - [SUBJ*]a[OBJ]___a [SUBJ*]a[OBJ]___a [SUBJ*]a[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  negative present  [NEG.SUBJ]___i  [NEG.SUBJ]___i [NEG.SUBJ]___ - [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___ } * Although rarely used, the \\"indefinite present\\" adds a small complication to the presentation of Swahili grammar as the -a- marking the tense causes the subject concords to undergo reduction in the same manner as the prefixes of the genitive preposition -a. This is outlined above. In informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ni- to collapse into the -na- of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the \\"definite\\" and \\"indefinite\\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a na-, however short verbs retain their -ku- extension in the -na- tense and lose it in the -a- tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in (ni)nakula \\"I eat\\", in the -na- present tense, versus nala \\"I eat\\", in the -a- present tense. {  + Examples (\\"definite\\", \\"indefinite, negative) - !

The prefix hu- is added to the beginning of the verb and short verbs do not need their -ku- extension. {  +Formation of the habitual -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! positive future  hu([OBJ])___a  hu([OBJ])___a hu([OBJ])___ } The habitual indicates repeated, habitual occurrence of an action (habitual aspect) or something occurring as a timeless general rule (gnomic aspect). Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ng'ombe hula nyasi. - ng'ombe hu-l(a) nyasi - head(s).of.cattle(CL9/10) HAB-eat grass(CL10) - \\"cow(s)\\" \\"eat(s), as a rule\\" \\"grass\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Cows eat grass.\\" / \\"A cow eats grass.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Sisi hunywa bia kila wikendi. - sisi hu-nyw(a) bia kila wikendi - 1P HAB-drink beer(CL9/10) every weekend(CL9) - \\"we\\" \\"drink(s), as a rule\\" \\"beer\\" \\"every\\" \\"weekend\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"We drink beer every weekend.\\" } The habitual aspect with hu- is often replaced by the present with -na- in everyday use, the sisi hunywa of the above example then being replaced with tunakunywa. Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving tunakunywaga or tunakunywanga. The habitual aspect with hu- is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms. {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Haba na haba hujaza kibaba. - haba na haba hu-ja(a)-z(a) kibaba - insignificant COM insignificant HAB- become.full-CAUS 1.56.litre.container(CL7) - \\"little\\" \\"and\\" \\"little\\" \\"fills, as a rule\\" \\"container\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"Little by little, a cup is filled.\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" (Roughly equivalent to \\"Slow and steady wins the race,\\" or \\"A penny saved is a penny earned.\\") } =Past= The past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix -li-. Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus -ku-. The positive tense marker -li- cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension -ku- (or -kw-) where necessary. The negative tense marker -ku- can take stress, meaning that an additional -ku- extension is not needed. {  + Formation of the past tense -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  positive past  [SUBJ]li___a  [SUBJ]liku___a [SUBJ]li___ - [SUBJ]li[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]li[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]li[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  negative past  [NEG.SUBJ]ku___a  [NEG.SUBJ]ku___a [NEG.SUBJ]ku___ - [NEG.SUBJ]ku[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ku[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ku[OBJ]___ } {  + Examples - ! Verb ! Example !Notes - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  -enda Alikwenda. \\"She went.\\" Alienda is also used. - Hakwenda. \\"She didn't go.\\" The -kw- marks the negative past and cannot be dropped. Hakuenda may also be encountered. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" -la Nilikula. \\"I ate.\\" Short verb: -ku- prevents -li- from being stressed - Sikula. \\"I didn't eat.\\" The -ku- marks the negative past and cannot be dropped. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" -andika Uliandika. \\"You wrote.\\"  - Hukuandika. \\"You didn't write.\\"  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" -jibu Tulijibu. \\"We answered.\\"  - Hatukujibu. \\"We didn't answer.\\"  } = Perfect = The perfect indicates an action or situation which occurred in the past, similarly to the past tense, however the focus of the utterance is on the relevance of this past action to the present moment. For example, the word nimepika \\"I have cooked\\" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas nilipika \\"I cooked\\" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not). The perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix -me-. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus -ja-. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker -me- cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs, but the negative marker -ja- is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension -ku- with -ja-. Some sources describe the -ja- form as containing more of an implication of \\"not yet\\" than a simple negation of the -me- form, however the word bado \\"still\\", \\"not yet\\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary. {  + Formation of the perfect tense -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  positive perfect  [SUBJ]me___a  [SUBJ]meku___a [SUBJ]me___ - [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  negative perfect  [NEG.SUBJ]ja___a  [NEG.SUBJ]ja(ku)___a [NEG.SUBJ]ja___ - [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___ } {  + Examples - !

Compare for example: ninachoka \\"I am becoming tired\\"; nimechoka \\"I have become tired\\", i.e. \\"I am tired.\\" For more information and examples, see the section on inchoative verbs below. Some speakers may replace the sequence of prefixes a-me- with ka- with more or less the same meaning. This may derive from the consecutive tense marker. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Paka wangu amepotea.  rowspan=\\"5\\" ↔ ! colspan=\\"3\\" Paka wangu kapotea. - paka w-angu a-me-pote(a) paka w-angu ka-pote(a) - (CL9)cat(s) CL1-GEN.1S CL1-PRF-get.lost (CL9)cat(s) CL1-GEN.1S CL1.PRF-get.lost - \\"cat\\" \\"my\\" \\"s/he-has-gotten-lost\\" \\"cat\\" \\"my\\" \\"s/he-has-gotten-lost\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"My cat is lost.\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"My cat is lost.\\" } * = Anterior -sha- = The anterior marker -sha- (or sometimes -kwisha-) is a relatively new TAM marker that derives diachronically from the verb kwisha \\"to finish, to run out\\". It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker -me-. It often imparts the meaning of \\"already\\", emphasising the completeness of the action. {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Asante, nimeshakula. - asante ni-me-sha-ku-l(a) - thank.you 1S-PRF-ANT-EXT-eat - \\"thank you\\" \\"I have already eaten\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"No thank you, I have already eaten.\\" } The anterior marker -sha- is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect -me-. These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker -ki- where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed. {  - ! colspan=\\"7\\" Ukishapata kazi, utakuwa na pesa za kutosha. - u-ki-sha-pat(a) kazi u-ta-ku-w(a) na pesa z-a ku-tosh(a) - 2S-SITU-ANT-get work(CL9) 2S-FUT-EXT-be COM money(CL10) CL10-GEN INF(CL15)-suffice - \\"once you get\\" \\"work\\" \\"you will be\\" \\"with\\" \\"money\\" \\"of\\" \\"to suffice\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" \\"Once you get a job, you will have enough money.\\" } =Future= The future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix -ta-. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with -ta- being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use -to- in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the -to- of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an h- at the beginning of the negative word. For example, atakuja \\"s/he will come\\" vs. _h_ atakuja \\"s/he will not come\\" (or _h_ at _o_ kuja). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended. -Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs. {  + Formation of the future tense -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  positive future  [SUBJ]ta___a  [SUBJ]taku___a [SUBJ]ta___ - [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  negative future (usual)  [NEG.SUBJ]ta___a  [NEG.SUBJ]taku___a [NEG.SUBJ]ta___ - [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" negative future (variant) [NEG.SUBJ]to___a [NEG.SUBJ]toku___a [NEG.SUBJ]to___ - [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___ } {  + Examples - !

It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final -a, where present, to -e-. The so-called \\"Arabic verbs\\" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable -si- into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative. {  + Formation of the subjunctive -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  positive subjunctive  [SUBJ]___e  [SUBJ]___e [SUBJ]___ - [SUBJ][OBJ]___e [SUBJ][OBJ]___e [SUBJ][OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  negative subjunctive  [SUBJ]si___e  [SUBJ]si___e [SUBJ]si___ - [SUBJ]si[OBJ]___e [SUBJ]si[OBJ]___e [SUBJ]si[OBJ]___ } {  + Examples - !

As there is no negative imperative, forms beginning with usi- and msi- may also be interpreted as such. {  - !Toka.  rowspan=\\"4\\" ↔ !Utoke.  rowspan=\\"4\\" ↔ !Usitoke. - Ø-tok(a)-Ø u-tok(a)-e u-si-tok(a)-e - IMP-got.out-2S.SBJ 2S.SBJ-go.out-SBJV 2S.SBJ-not-go.out- SBJV - \\"Go away.\\" \\"Get lost.\\" \\"You should go away!\\" \\"Can you (please) go away!\\" \\"Don't go away!\\" \\"You should not go away!\\" } = Situational = The situational, simultaneous or conditional tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ki-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension -ku- does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form. There is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using -sipo- is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of -ki- and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the -ku- extension does appear with -sipo- as the -po-, like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed. {  + Formation of the situational -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" positive situational [SUBJ]ki___a [SUBJ]ki___a [SUBJ]ki___ - [SUBJ]ki[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ki[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ki[OBJ]___ - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" negative situational (conditional only) [SUBJ]sipo___a [SUBJ]sipoku___a [SUBJ]sipo___ - [SUBJ]sipo[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]sipo[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]sipo[OBJ]___ } The situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \\"if\\" and \\"when\\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as kama, ikiwa or endapo may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ikiwa is itself the situational form of the verb -wa \\"to be\\", with the class 9 subject prefix i-, literally meaning on its own essentially \\"if it is\\". {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" (Kama) ukitaka kuja, utapaswa kulipa. - (kama) u-ki-tak(a) ku-j(a) u-ta-pas(a)-w(a) ku- lip(a) - (if) 2S.SBJ-SITU-want INF(CL15)-come 2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS INF(CL15)-pay - (\\"if\\") \\"if you want\\" \\"to come\\" \\"you will be behooved\\" \\"to pay\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"If you want to come, you will have to pay.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" (Kama) usipotaka kuja, hutapaswa kulipa. - (kama) u-si-po-tak(a) ku-j(a) hu-ta-pas(a)-w(a) ku-lip(a) - (if) 2S.SBJ-NEG-CL16.REL-want INF(CL15)-come NEG.2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS INF(CL15)-pay - (\\"if\\") \\"if you don't want\\" \\"to come\\" \\"you will not be behooved\\" \\"to pay\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"If you don't want to come, you will not have to pay.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"8\\" Wanajeshi wawili walikuja wakikimbia, wote wawili wakibeba upanga. - wanajeshi wa-wili wa- li-ku-j(a) wa-ki-kimbia w-ote wa-wili wa-ki-beb(a) upanga - soldiers(CL2) CL2-two CL2.SBJ-PST-EXT-come CL2.SBJ-SITU-run CL2-all CL2-two CL2.SBJ-SITU-carry machete(CL11) - \\"soldiers\\" \\"two\\" \\"they came\\" \\"(they) running\\" \\"all\\" \\"two\\" \\"(they) carrying\\" \\"machete\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" \\"Two soldiers came running, both of them carrying a machete.\\" } The situational may appear in compound progressive tenses. {  - ! colspan=\\"7\\" Tulipofika, alikuwa akila kwa pupa haraka iwezekanavyo. - tu- li-po-fik(a) a-li-ku-w(a) a-ki-l(a) kwa pupa haraka i-wezekan(a)-vyo - 1P.SBJ-PST-CL16.REL-arrive CL1.SBJ-PST-EXT-be CL2.SBJ-SITU-eat INST greed(CL9) quickly CL9.SBJ-be.possible-CL8.REL - \\"when we arrived\\" \\"he was\\" \\"(he) eating\\" \\"with\\" \\"greed\\" \\"quickly\\" \\"as it is possible\\" -  colspan=\\"7\\" \\"When we arrived, he was (in the middle of) eating greedily as quickly as possible.\\" } = Consecutive = The consecutive or narrative tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ka-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension -ku- does not appear with short verbs in this form. {  + Formation of the consecutive -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" positive consecutive [SUBJ]ka___a [SUBJ]ka___a [SUBJ]ka___ - [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___a [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___ } The consecutive tense is mainly used with the past tense -li- in narrating a sequence of events whereby -li- is used for the first verb and -ka- for subsequent verbs. It roughly carries the meaning \\"and then\\" and makes the use of na \\"and\\" or halafu / kisha \\"then\\" essentially redundant. Where context is clearly past, a narrative may also be begun with -ka-. {  - ! colspan=\\"9\\" Alipomwona nyoka, alivua shati akalitupa juu ya nyoka akamkanyaga. - a-li-po-mw-on(a) nyoka a-li-vua shati a-ka- li-tup(a) juu y-a nyoka a-ka-m-kanyag(a) - CL1-PST-CL.16.REL-CL.1-see snake(CL9) CL1-PST-take.off shirt(CL5) CL1-CNSC-CL5-throw top(CL9) CL9-GEN snake(CL9) CL1-CNSC-CL1-trample - \\"when he saw it\\" \\"snake\\" \\"he took off\\" \\"shirt\\" \\"he then threw it (the shirt)\\" \\"on top\\" \\"of\\" \\"snake\\" \\"he then trampled it (the snake)\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" \\"Upon seeing the snake, he took off his shirt, threw it over the snake and then trampled on it.\\" } There is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however the negative subjunctive may occasionally be used for this purpose. {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Niliduwaa, nisiwe na la kusema. - ni-li- duwa(a) ni-si-w(a)-e na l-a ku-sem(a) - 1S-PST-be.dumbfounded 1S-NEG- be-SBJV COM CL5-GEN INF(CL15)-say - \\"I was dumbfounded\\" \\"and then was not\\" \\"with\\" \\"(word) of\\" \\"to say\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"I was dumbfounded and (then) didn't have anything to say.\\" } = Expeditous = The consecutive marker -ka- may combine with the final -e of the subjunctive mood to form the expeditous. {  +Formation of the expeditous -  !Common Verb !Short Verb !Loan verb - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" positive expeditous [SUBJ]ka___e [SUBJ]ka___e [SUBJ]ka___ - [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___e [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___e [SUBJ]ka[OBJ]___ } The expeditous verb form is essentially the same as the subjunctive in meaning except with the added meaning of \\"and\\" or \\"then\\" introduced by the consecutive marker -ka-. {  - ! colspan=\\"9\\" Tulimpeleka kule Misri akawe balozi wetu katika nchi hiyo. - tu-li-m-pelek(a) kule Misri a-ka-w(a)-e balozi w-etu katika nchi hiyo - 1P-PST-CL1-send DEM.CL17.DIST Egypt CL1-CNSC-be-SBJV ambassador(CL5) CL1-GEN.1P in country(CL9) DEM.CL9.MED - \\"we sent him\\" \\"there\\" \\"Egypt\\" \\"that he then become\\" \\"ambassador\\" \\"our\\" \\"in\\" \\"country\\" \\"that aforementioned\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" \\"We sent him to Egypt (for him) to be our ambassador in that country.\\" } The word akawe in the above sentence could also be replaced with ili awe \\"in order that he be\\" or simply the subjunctive awe \\"that he be\\" (or \\"(for him) to be\\" in more natural contemporary English), but the -ka- added to this word emphasises his becoming an ambassador immediately following his being dispatched. The expeditous verb form is frequently used with imperatives (and \\"polite imperatives\\" in the subjunctive), again indicating roughly \\"and then\\". {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Uende mbele yangu ukawe mkamilifu. - u-end(a)-e mbele y-angu u-ka-w(a)-e m-kamilifu - 2S.SBJ-go-SBJV front.side(CL9) CL9-GEN.1S 2S.SBJ-CNSC-be-SBJV CL1-perfect - \\"go\\" \\"in front\\" \\"of me\\" \\"and be\\" \\"perfect\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"Go in front of me and be perfect.\\" } The subject prefix may be dropped when used with the imperative. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Nenda kamwambie ukweli. - nenda (u-)ka-mw-ambi(a)-e ukweli - go.IMP.2S (2S.SUBJ-)CNSC-CL1.OBJ- tell-SBJV truth(CL14) - \\"go\\" \\"and tell her\\" \\"truth\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Go and tell her the truth!\\" } = Irrealis = There are two irrealis verb forms, one which may be called \\"present irrealis\\" (marked by -nge-) and one which may be called \\"past irrealis\\" (marked by -ngali-). The standard means of forming the negative is to use -si- in the TAM slot, forming -singe- and -singali-.

Both the protasis (if-clause) and apodosis (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first. In order to disambiguate or emphasise, such as if the clauses are in the reverse order, a word for \\"if\\" (kama, ikiwa, endapo) may precede the protasis. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Ningependa kukuona tena. - ni-nge- pend(a) ku-ku-on(a) tena - 1S.SBJ-IRR-like/love INF(CL15)-2S.OBJ-see again - \\"I would like\\" \\"to see you\\" \\"again\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"I would like to see you again\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" (Ikiwa) ningekuwa ndege, ningekunyea kichwa. - (i-ki-w(a)) ni-nge-ku-w(a) ndege ni-nge-ku-ny(a)-e(a) kichwa - (CL9-SITU-be) 1S-IRR-EXT-be bird(CL9) 1S.SUBJ-IRR-2S.OBJ-defecate-APPL head(CL7) - \\"if (it is)\\" \\"if I were\\" \\"bird\\" \\"I would defecate on you\\" \\"head\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"If I were a bird, I would defecate on your head.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" (Kama) ningalijua hiyo, nisingalikuja hapa. - (kama) ni-ngali-ju(a) hiyo ni-si-ngali-ku-j(a) hapa - (if) 1S-IRR.PST-know DEM.CL9.MED 1S-NEG- IRR.PST-EXT-know DEM.CL16.PROX - (\\"if\\") \\"if I had known\\" \\"that aforementioned\\" \\"I would not have come\\" \\"here\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"If I had known that, I would not have come here!\\" } In the usage of many speakers, the distinction between the present and past irrealis forms is somewhat blurred so that the final example above may commonly be spoken as \\"(Kama) ningejua hiyo, nisingekuja hapa.\\" which, speaking strictly, could be interpreted as \\"If I knew that I would not come here.\\"  Relative verb forms  There are five verb templates which can be used to create relative clauses. The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a periphrastic relative using amba-. The following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled \\"REL\\". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is -taka- with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple -ta- which occurs otherwise. {  ! colspan=\\"2\\" Tense, Aspect, Mood !Subject !TAM !Relative !Object / Extension !Verb STEM !Final Vowel !Relative -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Tensed Past Positive SUB -li- REL (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- - Present Positive SUB -na- REL (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- - Future Positive SUB -taka- REL (OBJ) / EXT STEM -a -- -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Tenseless Positive SUB -- -- (OBJ) STEM -a- REL - Negative SUB  -si- REL (OBJ) STEM  -a -- } The relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with na- and ndi-. Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing o (the so-called \\"o of reference\\") {  ! Class !Relative Morpheme - ! 1 -ye - ! 2 -o - ! 3 -o - ! 4 -yo - ! 5 -lo - ! 6 -yo - ! 7 -cho - ! 8 -vyo - ! 9 -yo - ! 10 -zo - ! 11 -o - ! 14 -o - ! 15 -ko - ! 16 -po - ! 17 -ko - ! 18 -mo }  'To be'  In most languages with a verbal copula, the equivalent of the verb 'to be', it is this verb that exhibits the most irregularity and the most diversity of form. Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb -wa (infinitive kuwa) is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of essence versus a copula of state or location. This is similar to the distinction between ser and estar in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique continuative form. = Essence = == Invariable copula == The invariable copula ni is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the subject and complement) refer to one and the same referent: * Mimi ni Bahati. \\"I am Bahati.\\" * Dunia ni sayari tunapoishi. \\"Earth is the planet we live on.\\" It is also used to express membership of a class (a subset relationship): * Wao ni wanasayansi. \\"They are scientists.\\" * Jua ni nyota. \\"The sun is a star.\\" * Miti ni mimea mikubwa. \\"Trees are large plants.\\" It may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic. * Babake ni mrefu sana. \\"Her father is very tall.\\" * Mji huyu ni mdogo. \\"This town is small.\\" * Misuli yako ni kama chuma. Your muscles are like steel. The negative form si can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning: * Wewe si Bahati. \\"You are not Bahati.\\" * Jua si sayari. \\"The sun is not a planet.\\" * Pomboo si wadogo. \\"Dolphins are not small.\\" Because ni and si do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis. {  ! ! ! colspan=\\"2\\" Present ! colspan=\\"2\\" Past - !Number !Person !Positive !Negative !Positive !Negative - ! rowspan=\\"6\\" Singular  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1st mimi ni mimi si nilikuwa sikuwa - I am I am not I was I was not -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2nd wewe ni wewe si ulikuwa hukuwa - you are you are not you were you were not -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 3rd yeye ni yeye si alikuwa hakuwa - s/he is s/he is not s/he was s/he was not - ! rowspan=\\"6\\" Plural  rowspan=\\"2\\" 1st sisi ni sisi si tulikuwa hatukuwa - we are we are not we were we were not -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2nd nyinyi ni nyinyi si mlikuwa hamkuwa - you are you are not you were you were not -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 3rd wao ni wao si walikuwa hawakuwa - they are they are not they were they were not } A sentence begun with ni or si without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject \\"it\\" in English. With plural context, \\"they\\" may be meant. * Ni asubuhi sasa. \\"It's morning now.\\" * Ni vigumu kulala. \\"It's difficult to fall asleep.\\" * Ni wanene sana. \\"They're very fat.\\" On occasion, the invariable copula may follow regular forms of kuwa in other tenses. In the following example, the ni could also be left out. {  - ! colspan=\\"8\\" Kwa kweli, huyo alikuwa ni kondoo wa kukodiwa. - kwa kweli huyo a-li-ku-w(a) ni kondoo w-a ku-kodi-iw(a) - INST true DEM.MED.CL1 CL1-PST-EXT-be COP sheep(CL9) CL1-GEN INF(CL15)-rent-PASS - \\"by\\" \\"true\\" \\"that, aforementioned\\" \\"s/he was\\" \\"is\\" \\"sheep\\" \\"of\\" \\"being rented\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" \\"In truth, that was a rented sheep.\\" } == Emphatic copula == The emphatic or focusing copula ndi- places its subject in focus, emphasising that it is that particular referent and not another. The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with na. In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used. {  !Person / Class !Positive !Negative !Translation - ! 1st sing. ndimi, ndiye simi, siye \\"it is (not) I\\" - ! 2nd sing.  ndiwe, ndiye siwe, siye \\"it is (not) you\\" - ! 1st plur. ndisi, ndio sio, (sisi)* \\"it is (not) we\\" - ! 2nd plur. ndinyi, ndio sinyi, sio \\"it is (not) you\\" - ! 1 ndiye siye \\"it is (not) s/he\\" - ! 2 ndio sio \\"it is (not) they\\" - ! 3 ndio sio \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 4 ndiyo siyo \\"it is (not) they\\" - ! 5 ndilo silo \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 6 ndiyo siyo \\"it is (not) they\\" - ! 7 ndicho sicho \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 8 ndivyo sivyo \\"it is (not) they\\", \\"it is (not) so\\" - ! 9 ndiyo siyo \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 10 ndizo sizo \\"it is (not) they\\" - ! 11 ndio sio \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 14 ndio sio \\"it is (not) it\\" - ! 15 ndiko siko \\"it is (not) it\\" - !16 ndipo sipo \\"it is (not) (t)here\\" - ! 17 ndiko siko \\"it is (not) around (t)here\\" - !18 ndimo simo \\"it is (not) in (t)here\\" } * The form sisi \\"it is not us\\" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun sisi \\"we\\", \\"us\\". Instead it is virtually always replaced with sio. Forms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example: {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Mimi ndiye niliyewaona kwanza. - mimi ndi-ye ni-li-ye-wa- on(a) kwanza - 1S FOC.COP-CL1 1S-PST-REL.CL1-CL2-see first - \\"I\\" \\"am the one\\" \\"(I) who saw them\\" \\"first\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"I'm the one who saw them first.\\" } Compare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence: {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Niliwaona kwanza. - ni-li- wa-on(a) kwanza - 1S-PST-CL2-see first - \\"I saw them\\" \\"first\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"I saw them first.\\" } = Location = Location is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics -po, -ko and -mo. The class 1 subject concord a- (negative: ha-) is however replaced with yu- (negative: hayu-). The three clitics, -po, -ko and -mo correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate \\"definite\\", \\"indefinite\\" and \\"internal\\" location respectively. For example, wapo means essentially \\"they are here/there\\", wako means \\"they are around here/there\\" and wamo means \\"they are in here/there\\". {  ! ! colspan=\\"3\\" Positive ! colspan=\\"3\\" Negative - !Person / Class !Definite !Indefinite !Internal !Definite !Indefinite !Internal - ! 1st sing. nipo niko nimo sipo siko simo - ! 2nd sing. upo uko umo hupo huko humo - ! 1st plur. tupo tuko tumo hatupo hatuko hatumo - ! 2nd plur. mpo mko mmo hampo hamko hammo - ! 1 yupo yuko yumo hayupo hayuko hayumo - ! 2 wapo wako wamo hawapo hawako hawamo - ! 3 upo uko umo haupo hauko haumo - ! 4 ipo iko imo haipo haiko haimo - ! 5 lipo liko limo halipo haliko halimo - ! 6 yapo yako yamo hayapo hayako hayamo - ! 7 kipo kiko kimo hakipo hakiko hakimo - ! 8 vipo viko vimo havipo haviko havimo - ! 9 ipo iko imo haipo haiko haimo - ! 10 zipo ziko zimo hazipo haziko hazimo - ! 11 upo uko umo haupo hauko haumo - ! 14 upo uko umo haupo hauko haumo - ! 15 kupo kuko kumo hakupo hakuko hakumo - !16 papo pako pamo hapapo hapako hapamo - ! 17 kupo kuko kumo hakupo hakuko hakumo - !18 mpo mko mmo hampo hamko hammo } Under a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance nipo hapa \\"I am here\\" is regarded as correct but niko hapa \\"I am here\\" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with -ko over the other forms, such that niko hapa is very common. = State = Temporary states of being are frequently expressed as if they were locations, generally with the -ko clitic. In older forms of Swahili, this -ko was generally absent, with the subject prefix appearing as a standalone word for the copula. Nowadays, this short form is less usual although it is still frequently encountered in common phrases such as U hali gani? ('How are you?', literally 'You are in what condition?') {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Yu(ko) tayari. - yu-(ko) tayari - CL1-(REF.CL17) ready - \\"She/he is\\" \\"ready\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"She is ready.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Mbona u(ko) kimya? - mbona u-(ko) kimya - why.EMPH CL2-(REF.CL17) silent - \\"why\\" \\"you are\\" \\"silent\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Why are you silent.\\" } Note that the standalone form of the 2nd person plural prefix m- is not *m but mu. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Je, mu wazima? - je mu wa-zima - Q 2P CL2-healthy - \\"Question:\\" \\"you are\\" \\"healthy\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Are you well?\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Je, mko wazima? - je m-ko wa-zima - Q 2P-REF.CL17 CL2-healthy - \\"Question:\\" \\"you are\\" \\"healthy\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Are you well?\\" } = Relative forms = In the present tense, relative forms of the copula are formed with the subject prefix, the stem -li- in the positive and -si- in the negative, and the suffixed relative marker for the required noun class. In other tenses, relatives are formed regularly from the word kuwa. {  !Person / Class !Positive !Negative !Translation - ! 1st sing. niliye nisiye \\"(I) who is/am (not)\\" - ! 2nd sing.  uliye usiye \\"(you) who is/are (not)\\" - ! 1st plur. tulio tusio \\"(we) who are (not)\\" - ! 2nd plur. mlio msio \\"(you) who are (not)\\" - ! 1 aliye asiye \\"(he/she) who is (not)\\" - ! 2 walio wasio \\"(they) who are (not)\\" - ! 3 ulio usio \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 4 iliyo isiyo \\"which are (not)\\" - ! 5 lililo lisilo \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 6 yaliyo yasiyo \\"which are/is (not)\\" - ! 7 kilicho kisicho \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 8 vilivyo visivyo \\"which are (not)\\" - ! 9 iliyo isiyo \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 10 zilizo zisizo \\"which are (not)\\" - ! 11 ulio usio \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 14 ulio usio \\"which is (not)\\" - ! 15 kuliko kusiko \\"which is (not)\\" - !16 palipo pasipo \\"which is (not)\\", \\"where there is/are (not)\\" - ! 17 kuliko kusiko \\"which is (not)\\", \\"where there is/are (not)\\" - !18 mlimo msimo \\"which is (not)\\", \\"where there is/are (not) in there\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" daktari mmoja aliye pia mwandishi - daktari m-moja a-li-ye pia mwandishi - doctor(CL5) CL1-one CL1-COP.REL-REL.CL1 also writer(CL1) - \\"doctor\\" \\"one\\" \\"who is\\" \\"also\\" \\"writer\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"a doctor who is also a writer\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" madaktari wawili walio pia waandishi - daktari wa-wili wa-li-o pia waandishi - doctor(CL5) CL2-two CL2-COP.REL-REL.CL2 also writers(CL2) - \\"doctors\\" \\"two\\" \\"who are\\" \\"also\\" \\"writers\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"two doctors who are also writers\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" nyumba hizo zisizo za kawaida - nyumba hizo zi-si-zo z-a kawaida - houses(CL10) DEM.CL10.MED CL10-NEG.COP.REL-REL.CL2 CL10-GEN norm(CL9) - \\"houses\\" \\"those aforementioned\\" \\"which are not\\" \\"of\\" \\"norm\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"those unusual houses\\", \\"those houses which are not usual\\" } The locative clitics -po, -ko and -mo may also be attached to the end of these words as needed. {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" watu wote waliomo gerezani - watu w-ote wa-li-o-mo gereza-ni - people(CL2) CL2-all CL2-COP.REL- REL.CL2-REF.CL18 prison(CL5)-LOC(CL16/17/18) - \\"people\\" \\"all\\" \\"who are inside\\" \\"in prison\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"all the people who are in prison\\" } {  - !Zilizomo - zi-li-zo-mo - CL10-COP.REL- REL.CL10-REF.CL18 - \\"(things) which are inside\\" - \\"Table of Contents\\" } = Continuative = The continuative is a special verb form unique to the verb \\"to be\\", meaning \\"is still\\", \\"are still\\" or \\"am still\\". It is formed by attaching the subject prefix to the suffix -ngali. {  !Person / Class !Positive !Translation - ! 1st sing. ningali \\"I am still\\" - ! 2nd sing. ungali \\"you are still\\" - ! 1st plur. tungali \\"we are still\\" - ! 2nd plur. mngali \\"you are still\\" - ! 1 angali \\"he/she is still\\" - ! 2 wangali \\"they are still\\" - ! 3 ungali \\"it is still\\" - ! 4 ingali \\"they are still\\" - ! 5 lingali \\"it is still\\" - ! 6 yangali \\"they are still\\" - ! 7 kingali \\"it is still\\" - ! 8 vingali \\"they are still\\" - ! 9 ingali \\"it is still\\" - ! 10 zingali \\"they are still\\" - ! 11 ungali \\"it is still\\" - ! 14 ungali \\"it is still\\" - ! 15 kungali \\"it [action] is still\\" - !16 pangali \\"it [place] is still\\" - ! 17 kungali \\"it [place] is still\\" - !18 mngali \\"it [place] is still\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Ningali shuleni. - ni-ngali shule-ni - 1S-COP.CONT shule(CL9)-LOC(CL16/17/18) - \\"I am still\\" \\"in school\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"I am still at school.\\" } The continuous form of the copula is frequently used as in conjunction with other verbs both before and afterwards. {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Tulikuwa tungali hatujaona simba. - tu-li-ku-w(a) tu-ngali hatu-ja-on(a) simba - 1P-PST-EXT-be 1P-COP.CONT NEG.1P-NEG.PRF-see lion - \\"we were\\" \\"we are still\\" \\"we haven't seen\\" \\"lion\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"We still hadn't seen a lion.\\" } The locative clitics -po, -ko and -mo can be added to the end of the continuative forms. {  - ! colspan=\\"5\\" Konokono hao wangalipo hadi leo. - konokono hao wa-ngali-po hadi leo - snails(CL10) DEM.CL2.MED CL2-COP.CONT-REF.CL16 until today - \\"snails\\" \\"those aforementioned\\" \\"they are still there\\" \\"until\\" \\"today\\" -  colspan=\\"5\\" \\"Those snails still exist to this day.\\" }  'To have'  There is no dedicated verb meaning 'to have'. Its equivalent is kuwa na, literally 'to be with', using the comitative preposition na. In the present tense, however, kuwa na has special contractions, whereby the subject prefix is attached directly onto -na. Note that kuwa na has an existential meaning when the subject is in a locative class. {  !Person / Class !Positive !Negative !Translation - ! 1st sing. nina sina \\"I have\\" / \\"I don't have\\" - ! 2nd sing. una huna \\"you have\\" / \\"you don't have\\" - ! 1st plur. tuna hatuna \\"we have\\" / \\"we don't have\\" - ! 2nd plur. mna hamna \\"you have\\" / \\"you don't have\\" - ! 1 ana hana \\"he/she has\\" / \\"he/she doesn't have\\" - ! 2 wana hawana \\"they have\\" / \\"they don't have\\" - ! 3 una hauna \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 4 ina haina \\"they have\\" / \\"they don't have\\" - ! 5 lina halina \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 6 yana hayana \\"they have\\" / \\"they don't have\\" - ! 7 kina hakina \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 8 vina havina \\"they have\\" / \\"they don't have\\" - ! 9 ina haina \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 10 zina hazina \\"they have\\" / \\"they don't have\\" - ! 11 una hauna \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 14 una hauna \\"it has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - ! 15 kuna hakuna \\"it [action] has\\" / \\"it doesn't have\\" - !16 pana hapana \\"there is/are (no) ... there\\" - ! 17 kuna hakuna \\"there is/are (no)\\" - !18 mna hamna \\"\\"there is/are (no) ... in there\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"6\\" Tuna tatizo kwa sababu sina pesa - tu-na tatizo kwa sababu si-na pesa - 1P-COM problem(CL5) INST reason(CL9) si-na pesa - \\"we have\\" \\"problem\\" \\"with\\" \\"reason\\" NEG.1S-COM money(CL10) -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"We have a problem because I don't have any money.\\" } Kuwa na is declined regularlarly in every tense, mood and aspect other than the present. Note that it is then always written and pronounced with the na separate from the verb. {  - ! colspan=\\"6\\" Nisipokuwa na pesa, tutakuwa na tatizo. - ni-si-po-ku-w(a) na pesa tu-ta-ku-w(a) na tatizo - 1P-NEG.REL-REL.CL16-EXT-be COM money(CL10) 1P-FUT-EXT-be COM problem(CL5) - \\"if I am not\\" \\"with\\" \\"money\\" \\"we will be\\" \\"with\\" \\"problem\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"If I don't have any money, we will have a problem.\\" } When the subject is one of the locative classes, kuwa na has an existential meaning, equivalent to \\"there is/are/was\\" etc. in English. {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Kuna sababu ya kuhangaika. - ku-na reason y-a ku-hangaika - CL17-COM reason(CL9) CL9-GEN INF(CL15)-be.concerned - \\"the general area has\\" \\"reason\\" \\"of\\" \\"to be concerned\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"There is cause for concern.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"4\\" Hapa pana miti mingi. - hapa pa-na miti m-ingi - here(CL16) CL16-COM trees(CL4) CL4-many - \\"this specific place\\" \\"the specific place has\\" \\"trees\\" \\"many\\" -  colspan=\\"4\\" \\"There are a lot of trees here.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Hakuna matata. - haku-na matata - NEG.CL17-COM trouble(CL6) - \\"the general area doesn't have\\" \\"trouble/complications\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"There are no troubles/complications.\\" } * Note that this phrase, made famous by the movie The Lion King, was originally only used in certain areas and may now be regarded as a somewhat clichéd phrase used more by tourists than by Swahili speakers themselves. The following phrase is a more widely used equivalent. {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Hamna shida. - ham-na shida - NEG.CL18-COM problem(CL9) - \\"the internal place doesn't have\\" \\"problem\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"There is no problem (in it/in here).\\" } When the object of kuwa na is pronominal, it is present as a referential suffix attached to na. The forms of this suffix are identical to the relative markers and are given outlined as combining forms here. Occasionally these may be used in conjunction with a following noun for special emphasis. {  - !Ninacho. - ni-na-cho - 1S-COM-REF.CL7 - \\"I have it\\" - \\"I have it [thing of class 7].\\" } {  - ! ! colspan=\\"5\\" Watakuwa nazo sababu nyingi za kubaki. - wa-ta-ku-w(a) na-zo sababu ny-ingi z-a ku- baki - CL2-FUT-EXT-be COM-REF.CL10 reasons(CL10) CL10-many CL10-GEN INF(CL15)-stay - \\"they will be\\" \\"with them\\" \\"reasons\\" \\"many\\" \\"of\\" \\"to stay\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"They will have many reasons to stay.\\" } When kuwa na forms a relative clause and the object is relativised, the relative suffix appears on the relative form of kuwa (or alternatively on the relative pronoun amba-) and the identical referential suffix appears on na-. {  - ! colspan=\\"6\\" Hizi ni pesa zote nilizo nazo. - hizi ni pesa z-ote ni-li-zo na-zo - DEM.CL10.PROX COP money(CL10) CL10-all 1S-REL.COP-REL.CL10 COM-CL.10 - \\"these\\" \\"are\\" \\"money\\" \\"all\\" \\"that I am\\" \\"with them\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"This is all the money (that) I have.\\" (Note that pesa is plural in Swahili.) }  Compound tenses  Inchoative verbs A large number of Swahili verbs indicate the process of entering a state. For example, the verbs kulewa (\\"to get drunk\\"), kuchoka (\\"to become tired\\") and kuchelewa (\\"to become late\\") describe the respective changes to state from \\"not drunk\\" to \\"drunk\\", from \\"not tired\\" to \\"tired\\" and from \\"not late\\" to \\"late\\". These may be regarded as inherently inchoative verbs. There is, however, no equivalent stative verb for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. \\"to be [state]\\". Stative meanings such as \\"be drunk\\", \\"be tired\\" and \\"be late\\" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the perfect marker -me- (or, in the negative, -ja-). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs. {  + Examples - ! Base verb ! Inchoative ! Stative - ! -fa  Anakufa. \\"He dies / is dying.\\"  Amekufa. \\"He is dead.\\" ( = \\"He has died.\\") - ! -choka  Ninachoka. \\"I become / am becoming tired.\\"  Nimechoka. \\"I am tired.\\" ( = \\"I have become tired.\\") - !-vaa Tunavaa viatu. \\"We put / are putting on shoes.\\" Tumevaa viatu. \\"We are wearing shoes.\\" ( = \\"We have put on shoes.\\") - !-kasirikia Ananikasirikia. \\"He gets / is getting angry with me.\\" Amenikasirikia. \\"He is angry with me.\\" (= \\"He has become angry with me.\\") - !-jaa Bafu inajaa. \\"The bath fills / is filling up.\\" Bafu imejaa. \\"The bath is full.\\" (= \\"The bath has filled up.\\") - !-funguliwa Mlango unafunguliwa. \\"The door is (being) opened.\\" Mlango umefunguliwa. \\"The door is open.\\" (= \\"The door has been opened.\\") - !-iva Chakula kinaiva. \\"The food cooks / is cooking.\\" Chakula kimeiva. \\"The food is cooked.\\" - !-simama Wanasimama. \\"They get / stand / are getting up.\\" Wamesimama. \\"They are standing up / on their feet.\\" (= \\"They have stood up.\\") - !-keti Anaketi. \\"She sits / is (in the process of) sitting down.\\" Ameketi. \\"She is sitting down / seated.\\" (= \\"She has sat down.\\") } When using inchoative verbs, compound tenses must be used to talk about states occurring at times other than the present. {  !Base verb !Inchoative !Stative - ! rowspan=\\"3\\"  -lala  Wanalala \\"They fall / are falling asleep.\\"  Wamelala. \\"They are asleep / sleeping.\\" ( = \\"They have fallen asleep.\\") -  Walilala. \\"They fell asleep.\\"  Walikuwa wamelala. \\"They were asleep / sleeping.\\" ( = \\"They had fallen asleep.\\") -  Watalala. \\"They will fall asleep.\\"  Watakuwa wamelala. \\"They will be asleep / sleeping.\\" ( = \\"They will have fallen asleep.\\") - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" -amka Ninaamka \\"I wake / am waking up.\\" Nimeamka. \\"I am awake.\\" ( = \\"I have woken up.\\") - Niliamka. \\"I woke up.\\" Nilikuwa nimeamka. \\"I was awake.\\" ( = \\"I had woken up.\\") - Nitaamka. \\"I will wake up.\\" Nitakuwa nimeamka. \\"I will be awake.\\" ( = \\"I will have woken up.\\") - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" -fa Wanakufa \\"They die / are dying.\\" Wamekufa. \\"They are dead.\\" ( = \\"They have died.\\") - Walikufa. \\"They died.\\" Walikuwa wamekufa. \\"They were dead.\\" ( = \\"They had died.\\") - Watakufa. \\"They will die.\\" Watakuwa wamekufa. \\"They will be dead.\\" ( = \\"They will have died.\\") } Derived verbs New verbs are readily created from simple verbs by attaching various suffixes (often called extensions) to the stem to get different shades of meaning by altering grammatical voice. Note that the final -a of common and short verbs only appears at the very end of the verb and is dropped before any suffixes. = Reciprocal = The reciprocal suffix -an- adds the meaning \\"each other\\" to the verb. * -penda \\"to love\\" → -pendana \\"to love each other\\" * -andikia \\"to write to\\" → -andikiana \\"to write to each other\\" * -pata \\"to get, receive\\" → -patana \\"to reconcile\\" * -piga \\"to hit\\" → -pigana \\"to fight\\", \\"to hit each other\\" The subject of a reciprocal verb is generally plural, however a singular subject may be used, often followed by na and an additional referent. {  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Wanaume walipigana mitaani. - wanaume wa-li-pig(a)-an(a) mitaa-ni - neighbours(CL2) CL2-PST-hit-RECIP streets-LOC(CL16/17/18) - \\"men\\" \\"they fought each other\\" \\"on the streets\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The men fought (each other) on the streets.\\" } {  - ! colspan=\\"6\\" Nilipokuwa mvulana, nilipigana na yeyote aliyenikasirisha - ni-li-po-ku-w(a) mvulana ni-li-pig(a)-an(a) na ye-y-ote a-li-ye-ni-kasirish(a) - 1S-PST-CL16.REL- EXT-be boy(CL1) CL2-PST-hit-RECIP COM CL1.REL-CL1-ALL CL1-PST- CL1.REL-1S-make.angry - \\"when I was\\" \\"boy/young man\\" \\"I fought (each other)\\" \\"with\\" \\"anyone\\" \\"who made me angry\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" \\"When I was a young man, I got in fights with anyone who made me angry.\\" } = Applicative = The applicative suffix, frequently called the 'prepositional extension' in learning resources, adds one of various meanings to a verb usually represented by a preposition in English such as \\"to\\", \\"for\\", \\"in\\", \\"with\\" or even \\"from\\". The form of the applicative suffix varies, depending on vowel harmony and the reappearance of the /l/ which disappeared from an older stage of Swahili between the final two vowels. {  +Applicative suffix on common verbs: ! !Consonant-final root (Consonant + -a) !Vowel-final root (Vowel + -a) - !Preceding syllable has /a/, /i/, /u/ or /m̩/ -ia -lia - !Preceding syllable has /e/ or /o/ -ea -lea } * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikia \\"to write to\\" * -zungumza \\"to converse\\" → -zungumzia \\"to converse about\\", \\"to discuss\\" * -nunua \\"to buy\\" → -nunulia \\"to buy for\\" * -soma \\"to read\\" → -somea \\"to read to/for\\" * -kojoa \\"to urinate\\" → -kojolea \\"to urinate on/in/against\\" Loan verbs usually form their applicative forms by removing their final vowel and replacing it with either -ia or -ea according to the same rules. * -rudi \\"to return\\" → -rudia \\"to return to\\" * -samehe \\"to forgive\\" → -samehea \\"to forgive (sb.) for (sb.)\\" * -hesabu \\"to count\\", \\"to consider\\" → -hesabia \\"to count for\\", \\"to ascribe\\" = Causative = The causative suffix is added to verbs to indicate a person or thing causing another person or thing to perform the action of the original verb. There are a few ways in which causatives are formed. The most common and productive causative suffix is -isha, which follows the same rules of vowel harmony as the applicative suffix. {  +Applicative suffix on common verbs: ! !Consonant-final root (Consonant + -a) !Vowel-final root (Vowel + -a) - !Preceding syllable has /a/, /i/, /u/ or /m̩/ -isha -lisha - !Preceding syllable has /e/ or /o/ -esha -lesha } * -hama \\"to move (away)\\" → -hamisha \\"to banish; transfer; displace\\" * -chelewa \\"to be late\\" → -chelewesha \\"to delay; make late\\" * -soma \\"to read; study\\" → -somesha \\"to teach\\" * -kopa \\"to borrow\\" → -kopesha \\"to lend\\" * -weza \\"to be able\\" → -wezesha \\"to enable\\" * -enda \\"to go\\" → -endesha \\"to make go; drive (a vehicle)\\" * -vaa \\"to put on (clothes); dress (oneself)\\" → -valisha \\"to dress (somebody else)\\" * -ongea \\"to speak\\" → -ongelesha \\"to make speak\\" Short verbs have no preceding vowel so have to be learnt individually. * -fa \\"to die\\" → -fisha \\"to put to death; kill; destroy\\"; cf. the underived verb -ua \\"to kill\\" * -la \\"to eat\\" → -lisha \\"to feed (someone/something)\\" * -nywa \\"to drink\\" → -nywesha \\"to give (someone/something) water to drink\\" Loan verbs, except those ending in -au, remove their final vowel before adding these suffixes. * -fahamu \\"to understand\\" → -fahamisha \\"to make understand\\" * -rudi \\"to return; go back; come back\\" → -rudisha \\"to return (something); give back; bring back\\" * -tii \\"to obey\\" → -tiisha \\"to make obey; subdue; dominate; subjugate\\" * -furahi \\"to become happy\\" → -furahisha \\"to make happy; gladden\\" * -starehe \\"to relax\\" → -starehesha \\"to entertain; put at ease\\" * -sahau \\"to forget\\" → -sahaulisha \\"to make forget\\" These suffixes may also be added to verbs and nouns to create causative verbs from them. * imara \\"strong\\" (adjective) → -imarisha \\"to strengthen (something); fortify\\" * -fupi \\"short\\" (adjective) → -fupisha \\"to shorten (something)\\" * tayari \\"ready\\" (adjective) → -tayarisha \\"to prepare (something); to make ready\\" * bora \\"better\\" (adjective) → -boresha \\"to improve (something); to make better\\" * safi \\"clean\\" (adjective) → -safisha \\"to clean (something)\\" * sababu \\"cause; reason\\" (noun) → -sababisha \\"to cause\\" * lazima \\"obligation\\" (noun) → -lazimisha \\"to force; compel\\" * orodha \\"list\\" (noun) → -orodhesha \\"to list; to make a list\\" * huzuni \\"sadness\\" (noun) → -huzunisha \\"to make sad; sadden\\" * hakika \\"certainty\\" (noun) → -hakikisha \\"to make sure; make certain; assure\\" There is a less common causative suffix -iza or -eza which appears with some words. Often there is more than derivation from the same word, sometimes with different meanings. * -penda \\"to like; love\\" → -pendeza \\"to please; be nice; be attractive\\"; cf. -pendesha \\"to cause to like/love\\" * -lipa \\"to pay\\" → -lipiza \\"to take vengeance/revenge on; to make (somebody) pay (figuratively)\\"; cf. -lipisha \\"to charge a fee; to make (somebody) pay (literally)\\" There is another means of deriving causative verbs and which results from an earlier -y- in the language. This -y- suffix combined with consonants and changed their pronunciation, palatalising or \\"softening\\" them. The following table outlines the common sound changes. {  !consonant !becomes: - -t-  rowspan=\\"2\\" -sh- - -k- - -l- -z- - -n- -ny- - -p- -fy- - -w- -vy- } In many cases, more than one of these suffixes may be used to derive different verbs from a single verb, formed by various means. In some cases, such as with -onyesha \\"to show\\", two causative suffixes may appear together. * -ona \\"to see\\" → -onya \\"to warn\\"; cf. -onyesha \\"to show\\" (also: -onesha) * -ogopa \\"to fear; be afraid/scared of\\" → -ogofya \\"to frighten; to be scary\\"; cf. -ogopesha \\"to frighten; to be scary\\" (no difference in meaning) * -pona \\"to heal; to get better; to recover\\" (intransitive) → -ponya \\"to heal (somebody); to make recover\\"; cf. -ponyesha \\"to heal (somebody); to make recover\\" (no difference in meaning) * -pita \\"to pass\\" → -pisha \\"to give way; make room for; allow to pass\\"; cf. -pitisha \\"to make pass\\" * -lala \\"to lie down; fall asleep\\" → -laza \\"to house; provide with accommodation; lay sb. down; admit (somebody to hospital)\\"; cf. -lalisha \\"to put (somebody) to bed\\" * -lewa \\"to get drunk/inebriated\\" → -levya \\"to intoxicate\\" (of a drug); cf. -lewesha \\"to get (somebody) drunk\\" Verbs that end with -ka very frequently exchange this to -sha to form the causative, however this is much less common when the preceding syllable contains e or i. * -amka \\"to wake up\\" (oneself) → -amsha \\"to wake (somebody) up\\" * -chemka \\"to boil\\" (intransitive) → -chemsha \\"to boil (something); to make boil\\" (the m in this word is syllabic, derived from earlier \\"-mu-\\", so the e does not belong to the preceding syllable) * -waka \\"to shine, to catch fire\\" → -washa \\"to set on fire; light; switch on; start (e.g. a car)\\" * -choka \\"to become tired\\" → -chosha \\"to tire; be tiring; be tiresome; be boring\\" * -kumbuka \\"to remember\\" → -kumbusha \\"to remind\\" * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikisha \\"to make write\\" * -cheka \\"to laugh\\" → -chekesha \\"to make laugh; amuse; be funny\\" Because most of the word-final sequences of more than one vowel come from the deletion of an l that was present in an earlier stage of the language (and often preserved in many dialects and related languages), many verbs which today end in a sequence of two vowels are made by (removing the final -a) and adding -za. This -z- results from the palatalisation (\\"softening\\") process outlined above. which was applied to the -l- in these verbs. The -l- was subsequently lost but the -z- was not. * -tangaa \\"to become widely known\\" → -tangaza \\"to announce; proclaim; publicise\\" * -kataa \\"to refuse\\" → -kataza \\"to forbid\\"; cf. -katalisha \\"to make (somebody) refuse\\" * -tembea \\"to (go for a) walk\\" → -tembeza \\"to take for a walk; to walk (e.g. a dog)\\" * -kimbia \\"to run (away from)\\" → -kimbiza \\"to chase (away); pursue\\" * -jaa \\"to fill; become full\\" → -jaza \\"to fill; make full\\" = Passive = The passive suffix is generally -wa. * -jenga \\"to build\\" (whence Jenga) → -jengwa \\"to be built\\" * -sema \\"to say\\" → -semwa \\"to be said\\" * -danganya \\"to deceive\\" → -danganywa \\"to be deceived\\" Verb stems that end with l or either of the semivowels w or y (but not ny as that is a single consonant written with two letters, as illustrated by -danganywa above) take a suffix -iwa; if the preceding syllable contains e or o, it will be -ewa instead. * -pwaya \\"to pound\\" → -pwayiwa \\"to be pounded\\" * -chovya \\"to immerse\\" → -chovyewa \\"to be immersed\\" * -doya \\"to investigate\\" → -doyewa \\"to be investigated\\" * -gawa \\"to share; divide\\" → -gawiwa \\"to be shared; be divided\\" * -tawala \\"to govern; rule\\" → -tawaliwa \\"to be governed; be ruled\\" Verbs whose ending in one of the front vowels plus a, (i.e. the sequences -ea and -ia) usually simply add -wa. * -ambia \\"to tell (someone)\\" → -ambiwa \\"to be told\\" (of someone) * -tegemea \\"to rely on\\" → -tegemewa \\"to be relied on\\" * -zuia \\"to prevent\\" → -zuiwa \\"to be prevented\\" A few words of this group, however, add -lewa (after an e) or -liwa (after i), resulting from the earlier . * -tia \\"to put in\\" → -tiliwa \\"to be put in\\" * -lea \\"to bring up; raise\\" → -lelewa \\"to be brought up, raised\\" * -pokea \\"to receive\\" → -pokewa / -pokelewa \\"to be received\\" (both alternatives possible) As Swahili does not distinguish between the sequences /ua/ and /uwa/ or /oa/ and /owa/, the passive ending -wa would be inaudible on verbs, so the -liwa and -lewa endings are used instead. * -oa \\"to get married\\" (of a man) → -olewa \\"to get married\\" (of a woman) *-toa \\"to emit; publish; add; subtract; remove\\" → -tolewa \\"to be emitted; be published; be added; be subtracted; removed\\" (These verbs are auto-antonyms!) * -nunua \\"to buy\\" → -nunuliwa \\"to be bought\\" Note that the verb -ua \\"to kill\\" has an irregular passive form: -uawa, although the regular -uliwa is occasionally used. The Kiunguja dialect, specifically the variant of it spoken in Zanzibar City, which has been made the standard dialect, goes a step further than many other dialects, requiring also that all verbs ending in -aa be passivised with the suffix -liwa even though the difference between /ɑɑ/ and /ɑwɑ/ is perfectly distinct. * -zaa \\"to give birth to; sire\\" → -zaliwa \\"to be born\\" (dialectically also -zawa) * -vaa \\"to put on (clothing)\\" → -valiwa \\"to be put on\\" * -kaa \\"to sit; stay; reside\\" → -kaliwa \\"to be inhabited; be occupied; be settled; be sat upon; be stayed in\\" The short verbs have passive forms that must be learnt separately. In each case, the passive form is one syllable longer and falls into the category of common verbs and thus does not receive the extension -ku- anywhere in its conjugation. * -la \\"to eat\\" → -liwa \\"to be eaten\\" * -nywa \\"to drink\\" → -nywewa \\"to be drunk\\" * -pa \\"to give to\\" → -pewa \\"to be given; to receive\\" * -nya \\"to shit; drop (rain)\\" → -nyewa \\"to be shat; be dropped\\" * -cha \\"to fear; revere\\" → -chiwa \\"to be feared; revered\\" Most loan-verbs simply add -wa. * -hitaji \\"to need\\" → -hitajiwa \\"to be needed\\" * -kodi \\"to rent; hire\\" → -kodiwa \\"to be rented; be hired\\" * -samehe \\"to forgive\\" → -samehewa \\"to be forgiven\\" * -dai \\"to claim\\" → -daiwa \\"to be claimed\\" If a loan-verb ends with a consonant followed by -u, this u becomes an i * -laumu \\"to blame\\" → -laumiwa \\"to be blamed\\" * -jaribu \\"to try\\" → -jaribiwa \\"to be tried\\" Loan-verbs which end in -au add -liwa * -sahau \\"to forget\\" → -sahauliwa \\"to be forgotten\\" Verbs ending in -uu lose one u and replace it with -liwa. * -nukuu \\"to copy; transcribe; transliterate\\" → -nuku-liwa \\"to be copied; be transcribed; be transliterated\\" The agent in a sentence with a passive verb does not need to be included in the sentence. The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the mediopassive below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition na, which is here the equivalent of the English \\"by\\", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to \\"and\\" or \\"with\\". = Mediopassive = The mediopassive suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involved ends in -ka and generally the harmonic i or e before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost l of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic i or e. {  + Mediopassive suffix on common verbs ! !Consonant-final root (Consonant + -a) !Vowel-final root (Vowel + -a) - !Preceding syllable has /a/, /i/, /u/ or /m̩/ -ika -ka, -lika - !Preceding syllable has /e/ or /o/ -eka -ka, -leka } * -vunja \\"to break (something)\\" → -vunjika \\"to break\\" (intransitive) * -pika \\"to cook (something)\\" → -pikika \\"to cook\\" (intransitive) * -elewa \\"to understand (something)\\" → -eleweka \\"to be understood\\" * -sikia \\"to hear\\" → -sikika \\"to be heard; be audible\\" * -kaa \\"to sit; stay; inhabit\\" → -kalika \\"to be inhabited; be inhabitable\\" * -zoea \\"to get used to; grow accustomed to\\" → -zoelika \\"to become customary\\" As with the other derivational suffixes (or \\"extensions\\"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding -ika or -eka according to vowel harmony rules. The exceptions are those ending in -au which use -lika'. * -haribu \\"to spoil (something); ruin; destroy\\" → -haribika \\"to spoil; get spoiled; get ruined; get destroyed\\" * -sahau \\"to forget\\" → -sahaulika \\"to become forgotten\\" * -kebehi \\"to ridicule; make fun of\\" → -kebehika \\"to get ridiculed; get made fun of\\" In learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the \\"stative extension\\" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states. For example, the mediopassive verb -vunjika \\"to break; go to pieces\\" contrasts with its source verb -vunja \\"to break; make go to pieces\\", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic — both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time — but in that the subject of -vunjika is equivalent to the object of -vunja, and the subject of -vunja is completely absent from a clause with -vunjika. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples. {   colspan=\\"3\\" Active transitive verb (dynamic): - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Juma alivunja dirisha. - Juma a-li-vunj(a) dirisha - [male name] CL1-PST-break(TR) (CL5)window - \\"Juma\\" \\"s/he broke\\" \\"window\\" -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"Juma broke the window.\\" } {   colspan=\\"3\\" Passive transitive verb (dynamic): - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Dirisha lilivunjwa (na Juma). - dirisha li-li-vunj(a)-w(a) (na Juma) - (CL5)window CL5-PST-break(TR)-PASS (COM [male name]) - \\"window\\" \\"it was broken\\" (\\"by Juma\\") -  colspan=\\"3\\" \\"The window was broken (by Juma).\\" } {   colspan=\\"2\\" Mediopassive verb (dynamic): - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Dirisha lilivunjika. - dirisha li-li- vunj(a)-ik(a) - (CL5)window CL5-PST-break(TR)-MEDIOPASS - \\"window\\" \\"it broke\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\" \\"The window broke.\\" } Mediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence \\"Dirisha limevunjika\\" means either \\"The window _has_ broken,\\" or \\"The window _is_ broken.\\" What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, -vunjika, does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from \\"whole; intact\\" to \\"broken; in pieces\\". The perfect -me- here indicates that one is concerned with the state after the dynamic process. = Reversive = The reversive form of a verb indicates a reversal of the action of the verb. It has fallen out of active use in modern Swahili, but still exists in a number of verbs that now are lexicalized. It is formed by adding -u or -o to the verb stem before the final -a. Examples: * kufunga \\"to close/shut \\" * kufungua \\"to open\\" * kupanga \\"to arrange\\" * kupangua \\"to disarrange\\" {  ! colspan=\\"3\\" Rashid amefunga mlango. - Rashid a-me-fung(a) mlango - [male name] CL1-PRF-close (CL3)door - \\"Rashid\\" \\"s/he has closed\\" \\"door\\" } {  ! colspan=\\"3\\" Rashid amefungua mlango. - Rashid a-me-fung-u(a) mlango - [male name] CL1-PRF-open-REV (CL3)door - \\"Rashid\\" \\"s/he has opened\\" \\"door\\" } = Suffix stacking = Suffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili. * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikwa \\"to be written\\" * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikisha \\"to cause to write\\" → -andikishwa \\"to be caused to write\\" * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikia \\"to write to\\" → -andikiwa \\"to be written to\\" * -andika \\"to write\\" → -andikia \\"to write to\\" → -andikiana \\"to write to each other\\" → -andikianisha \\"to cause to write to each other\\" → -andikianishwa \\"to be caused to write to each other\\" Here is another rather more implausible example: * -la \\"to eat\\" : → -lika \\"to be edible\\" :: → -likia \\"to be edible to\\" ::: → -likiana \\"to be edible to each other\\" :::: → -likianisha \\"to cause to be edible to each other\\" ::::: → -likianishwa \\"to be caused to be edible to each other\\" == Prepositions ==  Comitative na  In addition to functioning as a conjunction meaning \\"and\\", na is also a very common preposition meaning: # \\"With\\" in a comitative sense (\\"together with\\", \\"along with\\", \\"accompanied by\\"), often occurring after reciprocal verbs ending in -ana. Njoo nami. \\"Come with me.\\" Yuko pale pamoja na rafiki zake. \\"She is there with her friends.\\" Dada yako anafanana na mama yenu. \\"Your sister looks like your mother. # \\"With\\" in an ornative sense (\\"having\\") when appearing with the verb kuwa \\"to be\\" to form kuwa na \\"to have\\". Nina pesa zako. \\"I have your money.\\" Kusingekuwa na mbu. \\"There wouldn't be any mosquitos.\\" (See: 'to have') # \\"By\\" when introducing the agent in a passive sentence. Alipendwa sana na kila mtu kijijini. \\"He was loved by everyone in the village.\\" Shortened forms of pronouns are frequently suffixed to na, both when na is used as a preposition. {  !Person / Class !Short !Full form !Translation - ! 1st sing. nami na mimi \\"with me\\", \\"by me\\", \\"and I\\" - ! 2nd sing. nawe na wewe \\"with you\\", \\"by you\\", \\"and you\\" - ! 1st plur. nasi na sisi \\"with us\\", \\"by us\\", \\"and we\\" - ! 2nd plur. nanyi na ninyi \\"with you\\", \\"by you\\", \\"and you\\" - ! 1 naye na yeye \\"with him/her\\", \\"by her/him\\", \\"and she/he\\" - ! 2 nao na wao \\"with them\\", \\"by them\\", \\"and they\\" - ! 3 nao na huo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 4 nayo na hiyo \\"with them\\", \\"by them\\", \\"and they\\" - ! 5 nalo na hilo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 6 nayo na hayo \\"with them\\", \\"by them\\", \\"and they\\" - ! 7 nacho na hicho \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 8 navyo na hivyo \\"with them\\", \\"by them\\", \\"and they\\" - ! 9 nayo na hiyo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 10 nazo na hizo \\"with them\\", \\"by them\\", \\"and they\\" - ! 11 nao na huo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 14 nao na huo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" - ! 15 nako na huko \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" [action] - !16 napo na hapo \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" [place] - ! 17 nako na huko \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" [place] - !18 namu na humu \\"with it\\", \\"by it\\", \\"and it\\" [place] }  Genitive -a  The genitive preposition -a (sometimes termed a \\"connector\\", \\"possessive\\" or \\"associative\\" preposition) has a similar role to that of the genitive case of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \\"of\\". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example: * kitabu cha mwanafunzi \\"the student's book\\" (\\"book of student\\") * vitabu vya mwanafunzi \\"the student's books\\" (\\"books of student\\") The equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as taa ya barabarani \\"traffic light\\", \\"street light\\", which is literally equivalent to \\"light of road-LOC\\". The personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example: *kitabu chake \\"his/her book\\" The genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see here), plus -a. There are some sound changes that happen. U- and i- become their equivalent semivowels w- and y- respectively. After consonants, this y is generally dropped although ki- and vi- become ch- and vy-. The class 1 verbal concord a- is an exception, being replaced with w- in the genitive construction. {  ! Class ! Verbal subject concord !

It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of -a. Where there is no 15 or class 17 antecedent, its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an instrumental use of \\"by (means of)\\", \\"using\\" or \\"with\\". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by kwenye for inanimate referents. * Tulikuja kwa miguu. \\"We came on foot.\\" (Literally: \\"We came by feet.\\") * Alirudi kwa Rehema. \\"She returned to Rehema's (place).\\"  Ornative -enye  The ornative preposition -enye essentially means \\"having\\" or \\"with\\" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive -a with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix mw- instead of w-.

When placed in the eater's mouth, it produces vapors which comes out of the nose and mouth, giving the dessert its name. ==Description== Dragon's Breath is made using colorful cereal balls described as having a flavor similar to Froot Loops. The cereal is dipped in liquid nitrogen and served in a cup. The eater uses a stick to skewer the balls. Once in the eater's mouth, the cold of the liquid nitrogen combines with the warmth of the mouth to release visible vapors out of the nose and mouth. According to Glutto Digest, Dragon's Breath was originally invented and served at “minibar” by José Andrés in 2008. After Andrés stopped serving it at his LA restaurant “The Bazaar” in 2009, it spread throughout Taiwan, Korea, and the Philippines over the following years. According to The Straits Times, Dragon's Breath first appeared in the Philippines and South Korea circa 2015, but gained popularity when Los Angeles-based chain, Chocolate Chair, added it to its menu. Dragon's Breath is noted for the spectacle of its consumption more than its flavor, with several publications commenting on its compatibility with Instagram trends. ==Safety== Liquid nitrogen is used in several foods and drinks to quickly freeze them or for the vapors it produces. Its consumption poses several dangers to humans. The extreme cold temperature can cause damage to human tissue, and the displacement of oxygen by nitrogen can cause asphyxiation. At a shop in Singapore in 2016, a woman was burned when the dessert stuck to her gums. In August 2017, a South Korean boy was hospitalized and required surgery when the liquid left at the bottom of the Dragon's Breath cup caused a 5 centimeter hole in his stomach. In October 2017, two children at the Pensacola Interstate Fair in Florida were injured while handling or consuming Dragon's Breath. A 14-year-old suffered a burn on her thumb from contact with the frozen dessert. Another child suffered second degree burns on the roof of her mouth. Following complaints, the fair's general manager announced the vendor would not be allowed to sell Dragon's Breath at the next year's event. ==References== Category:Frozen desserts Category:Cryogenics ","title":"Dragon's Breath (dessert)"},{"id":"56563725","text":"Xuxa e os Duendes () the soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2002 by Som Livre.

He has been designated a terrorist by the United States and identified in the press as one of the four Jihadi Beatles who took part in Daesh atrocities. Kotey has denied being a member of \\"the Beatles\\" but admits joining the Daesh terrorist group. ==Early life== Born in Britain to a Ghanaian father and Greek Cypriot mother, Kotey spent his youth in Shepherd's Bush. The Daily Telegraph reports he is a supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C. and dreamed of joining the team when he grew up. His Syrian captors say Kotey worked as a drug dealer in London prior to his radicalisation. He is believed to have converted to Islam in his early twenties and left two young children in Britain. ==Time in Daesh== In 2014 and 2015, Daesh held dozens of European and North American captives, and the brutal conditions of their detention were widely reported. Four English-speaking Daesh fighters played a central role in the brutality. Their identities were initially either not known, or security officials did not make their identities known to the public, so the press dubbed the four as the Jihadi Beatles, with the most well-known being known as Jihadi John. Later Kotey was reported to have been one of the other three Beatles. On 10 January 2017, the United States Department of State formally designated Kotey as a terrorist under the authority of Executive Order 13224. This designation prohibited American citizens, financial institutions, and other American corporations, from having any financial dealings with him. The US claims that Kotey was involved in beheadings and known for administering \\"exceptionally cruel torture methods\\", including \\"electronic shocks\\". The 34-year-old is also accused of acting as an Isis recruiter and being responsible for drawing several other British extremists to join Isis. Kotey has denied being a member of \\"the Beatles\\", but admits joining the Daesh terrorist group. Daesh controlled areas of Syria and Iraq underwent a steady erosion in 2015, 2016 and 2017, with their remaining enclaves collapsing in late 2017 and early 2018. Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, a friend from London, who was also reported to have been one of the Jihadi Beatles, were captured trying to flee the region, on 24 January 2018. ==Prosecution== The Independent reported that the United Kingdom government was considering agreeing that Kotey and Elsheikh could be transferred to the Guantanamo detention camps. Detention in Guantanamo might mean indefinite detention without charge; if transferred to US custody for a civilian trial and convicted, they would likely be detained at the Supermax prison near Florence, Colorado. The Independent described how bleak conditions would be at the Florence Supermax, confinement to a featureless cell, for 23 hours a day, practically no human contact, exercise periods in a small featureless courtyard, near their cell. Another option under consideration is trial at the International Court in the Hague. Tobias Ellwood of the UK Ministry of Defence had argued that transfer to Guantanamo was inappropriate. In March 2018, Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh complained that their British citizenship had \\"illegally\\" been withdrawn (judges have previously found the UK in breach of international law when stripping citizenship from terror suspects who are not dual nationals), leaving them stateless and at risk of \\"rendition and torture\\". UK security minister Ben Wallace confirmed in July 2018 that both men had been stripped of their UK citizenship. While the UK will not normally extradite suspects if they might be subject to the death penalty, in July 2018 it was reported that British Home Secretary Sajid Javid had written to the US attorney general about the case, saying \\"I am of the view that there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought.\\" Javid said that the decision was for this specific case, not a change to the government's support of the global abolition of the death penalty. The BBC security correspondent said that the UK opposed the controversial military prison in Guantanamo Bay: if the two are sent there, the UK will not share intelligence for the trial; but if they go to a civil trial, the UK will. On 9 October 2019, Charlie Savage, of The New York Times, reported that Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were in the process of being transferred from Kurdish territories to custody of the USA. On 7 October 2020, Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were brought to the United States to face charges of beheading western hostages. ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the United Kingdom ","title":"Alexanda Kotey"},{"id":"56563792","text":"Himatium errans is a species of snout or bark beetle in the family Curculionidae.

It refers to both Lutheran scholasticism and Reformed scholasticism. Anglicanism never developed a scholastic theology; however, Anglican writers in the 1600s studied early Christian writings to prove that Anglicanism had faithfully followed the teachings and practices of the early Church.

It is in Wat Kanlaya Sub- district, Thon Buri District, on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, south of Bangkok Yai Canal. The neighbourhood, dating to the Ayutthaya period, includes communities of several faiths living in close proximity. Today, it is best known for the Catholic community (mainly of Portuguese descendants) around Santa Cruz Church, but the wider neighbourhood also includes the areas around Wat Kanlayanamit, Kudi Khao Mosque, and the Chinese Kuan An Keng Shrine. Conservation and revitalization efforts beginning in 2008 have made the neighbourhood a cultural tourism destination. ==History== The neighbourhood, dating to the Ayutthaya period, includes communities of several faiths living in close proximity. It can be divided into a total of six communities, which consists of people of various races including Thai, Mon, Chinese, Portuguese and Islamic. For the Portuguese, they received the plot of land from the King Taksin in this area. They emigrated from Ayutthaya after fell in 1767, along with other ethnic groups. Later in 1769, there was a construction of a Catholic church called Santa Cruz Church as it appears today. Their land is considered a land under the administration of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangkok from the past. Therefore, absolutely do not resell or transfer ownership to third parties. There are three types of land and church like this in Bangkok Metropolitan Region, in addition to the Kudi Chin, including Holy Rosary Church in Talat Noi, Immaculate Conception Church in Sam Sen, and Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Phra Pradaeng, Samut Prakan. Today, it is best known for the Catholic community (mainly of Portuguese descendants, in 2014, they have a population of about 1,850 people in 293 households) around Santa Cruz Church, but the wider neighbourhood also includes the areas around Wat Kanlayanamit, Kudi Khao Mosque, and the Chinese Kuan An Keng Shrine. All linked to each other by bicycle and walking pathway along the Chao Phraya River. Conservation and revitalization efforts beginning in 2008 have made the neighbourhood a cultural tourism destination. The symbol of this community is rooster which is adapted from Rooster of Barcelos, or Galo de Barcelos in Portuguese, which is the national emblem of Portugal to indicate the roots of the community people. Its name \\"Kudi Chin\\" or \\"Kadi Chin\\" meaning \\"Chinese monk's dwelling\\", refers to Santa Cruz Church, also known as Kudi Chin. However, it has an explanation that should refer to the Chinese temple on the Chao Phraya River that had been built since the Ayuthaya period. Until the time passed to Thonburi and Rattanakosin periods, it has deteriorated. Therefore being rebuilt as the current Kuan An Keng Shrine. ==Sights== Beside church and temples, Kudi Chin also has many interesting things: *Baan Kudichin Museum, the three-story renovated wooden house of community leader is a learning center stories about the history of community, the ground floor is café and souvenir shop for visitors. While the second and third floors exhibits objects used in the past, the way of life and faith, Portugal–Thailand relations, Thai loanwords from Portuguese language, and the origin of the Siamese–Portuguese, as well as old photographs of the community. One interesting thing on the third floor of this house is the doll that represents Phi Hua Phrik (Chilli Head Ghost) or Phi Nu Liap (Little Liap Ghost), a lonely naughty imp in form of little boy. It is a common belief of community people since the past, there is a said when the church bell on the belfry rings at 06.00 pm of each day, signalling the home time. The children who are playing in various area of the community need to return home promptly. If anyone violates will be kidnapped by Phi Nu Liap and keeping them as its playmates until it is bored or contented and finally releases them to free without doing any harm. Said that it was subtle and clever means implemented by the elders in order to set up a curfew for the young children to them safety. Moreover, on the roof top is also used as a viewing point and taking photos of the surrounding scenery community and panoramic views of Chao Phraya River. The museum open for free admission on Tuesday–Sunday from 09.00 am to 06.00 pm. *Baan Sakunthong, the homey, reservation-only eatery that serves many traditional Thai dishes that are rare and influenced by Portuguese cuisine, it is available by reservation only.

It is a feature appearing in an image that is not present in the original object. Many different artifacts can occur during MRI, some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient- related, signal processing-dependent and hardware (machine)-related. (CC-BY 4.0) ==Patient-related MR artifacts== Motion artifacts Fig. 1. Motion artifact (T1 coronal study of cervical vertebrae). A motion artifact is one of the most common artifacts in MR imaging. Motion can cause either ghost images or diffuse image noise in the phase-encoding direction. The reason for mainly affecting data sampling in the phase-encoding direction is the significant difference in the time of acquisition in the frequency- and phase-encoding directions. Frequency-encoding sampling in all the rows of the matrix (128, 256 or 512) takes place during a single echo (milliseconds). Phase-encoded sampling takes several seconds, or even minutes, owing to the collection of all the k-space lines to enable Fourier analysis. Major physiological movements are of millisecond to seconds duration and thus too slow to affect frequency-encoded sampling, but they have a pronounced effect in the phase- encoding direction. Periodic movements such as cardiac movement and blood vessel or CSF pulsation cause ghost images, while non-periodic movement causes diffuse image noise (Fig. 1). Ghost image intensity increases with amplitude of movement and the signal intensity from the moving tissue. Several methods can be used to reduce motion artifacts, including patient immobilisation, cardiac and respiratory gating, signal suppression of the tissue causing the artifact, choosing the shorter dimension of the matrix as the phase-encoding direction, view-ordering or phase-reordering methods and swapping phase and frequency-encoding directions to move the artifact out of the field of interest. Flow Fig. 2. Flow-related signal loss in the carotid and basillary arteries (T2 axial study of the brain). Flow can manifest as either an altered intravascular signal (flow enhancement or flow-related signal loss), or as flow-related artifacts (ghost images or spatial misregistration). Flow enhancement, also known as inflow effect, is caused by fully magnetised protons entering the imaged slice while the stationary protons have not fully regained their magnetization. The fully magnetized protons yield a high signal in comparison with the rest of the surroundings. High velocity flow causes the protons entering the image to be removed from it by the time the 180-degree pulse is administered. The effect is that these protons do not contribute to the echo and are registered as a signal void or flow-related signal loss (Fig. 2). Spatial misregistration manifests as displacement of an intravascular signal owing to position encoding of a voxel in the phase direction preceding frequency encoding by time TE/2.The intensity of the artifact is dependent on the signal intensity from the vessel, and is less apparent with increased TE. Metal artifacts Fig. 3. Metal-related artifacts. Fig. 4. Metal-related artifacts. Metal artifacts occur at interfaces of tissues with different magnetic susceptibilities, which cause local magnetic fields to distort the external magnetic field. This distortion changes the precession frequency in the tissue leading to spatial mismapping of information. The degree of distortion depends on the type of metal (stainless steel having a greater distorting effect than titanium alloy), the type of interface (most striking effect at soft tissue-metal interfaces), pulse sequence and imaging parameters. Metal artifacts are caused by external ferromagnetics such as cobalt containing make-up, internal ferromagnetics such as surgical clips, spinal hardware and other orthopaedic devices, and in some cases, metallic objects swallowed by people with pica. Manifestation of these artifacts is variable, including total signal loss, peripheral high signal and image distortion (Figs 3 and 4). Reduction of these artifacts can be attempted by orientating the long axis of an implant or device parallel to the long axis of the external magnetic field, possible with mobile extremity imaging and an open magnet. Further methods used are choosing the appropriate frequency encoding direction, since metal artifacts are most pronounced in this direction, using smaller voxel sizes, fast imaging sequences, increased readout bandwidth and avoiding gradient-echo imaging when metal is present. A technique called MARS (metal artifact reduction sequence) applies an additional gradient, along the slice select gradient at the time the frequency encoding gradient is applied. ==Signal processing dependent artifacts== The ways in which the data are sampled, processed and mapped out on the image matrix manifest these artifacts. Chemical shift artifact thumbFig. 5. Chemical shift artifact: bright and dark streaks around the kidneys in an axial gradientecho opposed-phase image. Chemical shift artifact occurs at the fat/water interface in the phase encoding or section-select directions (Fig. 5). These artifacts arise due to the difference in resonance of protons as a result of their micromagnetic environment. The protons of fat resonate at a slightly lower frequency than those of water. High field strength magnets are particularly susceptible to this artifact. Determination of the artifact can be made by swapping the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients and examining the resultant shift (if any) of the tissues. Partial volume Partial volume artifacts arise from the size of the voxel over which the signal is averaged. Objects smaller than the voxel dimensions lose their identity, and loss of detail and spatial resolution occurs. Reduction of these artifacts is accomplished by using a smaller pixel size and/or a smaller slice thickness. Wrap-around Fig. 6. Wrap-around artifacts. Fig. 7. Wrap-around artifacts. A wrap-around artifact also known as an aliasing artifact, is a result of mismapping of anatomy that lies outside the field of view but within the slice volume. The selected field of view is smaller than the size of the imaged object. The anatomy is usually displaced to the opposite side of the image (Figs 6 and 7). It can be caused by non-linear gradients or by undersampling of the frequencies contained within the return signal. The sampling rate must be twice the maximal frequency that occurs in the object (Nyquist sampling limit). If not, the Fourier transform will assign very low values to the frequency signals greater than the Nyquist limit. These frequencies will then ‘wrap around’ to the opposite side of the image, masquerading as low-frequency signals. In the frequency encode direction a filter can be applied to the acquired signal to eliminate frequencies greater than the Nyquist frequency. In the phase encode direction, artifacts can be reduced by an increasing number of phase encode steps (increased image time). For correction, a larger field of view may be chosen. Gibbs artifacts Fig. 8. Gibbs artifact (T1 sagittal study of the brain). Gibbs artifacts or Gibbs ringing artifacts, also known as truncation artifacts are caused by the under-sampling of high spatial frequencies at sharp boundaries in the image. Lack of appropriate high-frequency components leads to an oscillation at a sharp transition known as a ringing artifact. It appears as multiple, regularly spaced parallel bands of alternating bright and dark signal that slowly fade with distance (Fig. 8). Ringing artifacts are more prominent in smaller digital matrix sizes. Methods employed to correct Gibbs artifact include filtering the k-space data prior to Fourier transform, increasing the matrix size for a given field of view, the Gegenbauer reconstruction and Bayesian approach. ==Machine/hardware-related artifacts== This is a wide and still expanding subject. Only a few common artifacts are recognised. Radiofrequency (RF) quadrature RF detection circuit failure arises from improper detector channel operation. Fourier-transformed data display a bright spot in the centre of the image. If one channel of the detector has a higher gain than the other it will result in object ghosting in the image. This is the result of a hardware failure and must be addressed by a service representative. External magnetic field (B0) inhomogeneity Fig. 9. B0 inhomogeneity: intensity distortion across a T1 axial study of the lumbar vertebrae. B0 inhomogeneity leads to mismapping of tissues. Inhomogeneous external magnetic field causes either spatial, intensity, or both distortions. Intensity distortion occurs when the field in a location is greater or less than in the rest of the imaged object (Fig. 9). Spatial distortion results from long-range field gradients, which remain constant in the inhomogeneous field. Gradient field artifacts (B1 inhomogeneity) Magnetic field gradients are used to spatially encode the location of signals from excited protons within the volume being imaged. The slice select gradient defines the volume (slice). Phase- and frequency-encoding gradients provide the information in the other two dimensions. Any deviation in the gradient would be represented as a distortion. As the distance increases from the centre of the applied gradient, loss of field strength occurs at the periphery. Anatomical compression occurs and is especially pronounced on coronal and sagittal imaging. When the phase-encoding gradient is different, the width or height of the voxel is different, resulting in distortion. Anatomical proportions are compressed along one or the other axis. Square pixels (and voxels) should be obtained. Ideally the phase gradient should be assigned to the smaller dimension of the object and the frequency gradient to the larger dimension. In practice this is not always possible because of the necessity of displacing motion artifacts. This may be corrected by reducing the field of view, by lowering the gradient field strength or by decreasing the frequency bandwidth of radio signal. If correction is not achieved, the cause might be either a damaged gradient coil or an abnormal current passing through the gradient coil. RF inhomogeneity Variation in intensity across the image may be due to the failure of the RF coil, non-uniform B1 field, non-uniform sensitivity of the receive only coil (spaces between wire in the coil, uneven distribution of wire), or presence of non-ferromagnetic material in the imaged object. Asymmetrical brightness There is a uniform decrease in signal intensity along the frequency encoding axis. Signal drop-off is due to filters that are too tight about the signal band. Some of the signal generated by the imaged section is, thereby, inappropriately rejected. A similar artifact may be caused by non-uniformity in slice thickness. RF noise RF pulses and precessional frequencies of MRI instruments occupy the same frequency bandwidth as common sources such as TV, radio, fluorescent lights and computers. Stray RF signals can cause various artifacts. Narrow-band noise is projected perpendicular to the frequency- encoding direction. Broadband noise disrupts the image over a much larger area. Appropriate site planning, proper installation and RF shielding (Faraday cage) eliminate stray RF interference. =Zero line and star artifacts= A bright linear signal in a dashed pattern that decreases in intensity across the screen and can occur as a line or star pattern, depending on the position of the patient in the ‘phase- frequency space’. Zero line and star artifacts are due to system noise or any cause of RF pollution within the room (Faraday cage). If this pattern persists, check for sources of system noise such as bad electronics or alternating current line noise, loose connections to surface coils, or any source of RF pollution. If a star pattern is encountered, the manufacturer needs to readjust the system software so that the image is moved off the zero point. =Zipper artifacts= Although less common, zippers are bands through the image centre due to an imperfect Faraday cage, with RF pollution in, but originating from outside, the cage. Residual free induction decay stimulated echo also causes zippers. RF tip angle inhomogeneity These are patchy areas of increased or decreased signal intensity. This artifact is produced by variations in RF energy required to tip protons 90 or 180 degrees within the selected slice volume. Bounce point artifact Fig. 10. Surface coil artefact: high signal at anterior thoracic wall adjacent to surface coil. Absence of signal from tissues of a particular T1 value is a consequence of magnitude sensitive reconstruction in inversion recovery imaging. When the chosen T1 equals 69% of the T1 value of a particular tissue, a bounce point artifact occurs. Use phase-sensitive reconstruction inversion recovery techniques. Surface coil artifacts Close to the surface coil the signals are very strong resulting in a very intense image signal (Fig. 10). Further from the coil the signal strength drops rapidly due to the attenuation with a loss of image brightness and significant shading to the uniformity. Surface coil sensitivity intensifies problems related to RF attenuation and RF mismatching. Slice-to-slice interference Fig. 11. Slice-to-slice interference (T1 axial study of lumbar vertebrae). Non-uniform RF energy received by adjacent slices during a multi-slice acquisition is due to cross- excitation of adjacent slices with contrast loss in reconstructed images (Fig. 11). To overcome these interference artifacts, the acquisition of two independent sets of gapped multi-slice images need to be included, and subsequently reordered during display of the full image set. ==References== Category:Magnetic resonance imaging ","title":"MRI artifact"},{"id":"56564318","text":"Suresh Arora is a 1982 cadre IPS officer and was the Chief of the Punjab Police.
