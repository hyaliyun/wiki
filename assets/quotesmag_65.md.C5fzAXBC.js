During the 1930s, she was associated with Benito Mussolini, and under his patronage ran a music school in Turin.  Early life  Magda Marie Anna Brard was born in Pontivy, Brittany, the daughter of , a businessman and politician. Her brother Roger Brard (1907-1977) became a naval admiral and president of the Societé Mathématique de France. She was a prize- winning student at the Paris Conservatoire, under Alfred Cortot.  Musical career  Magdeleine Brard toured in the United States as a pianist in 1919, sponsored by the French ministry of fine arts. She was possibly the youngest female soloist ever with the Metropolitan Opera when she played there at age 15. In spring 1922 she gave twenty concerts in France, and returned to the United States for further performances in the autumn of that year. During the 1922 visit, she volunteered as a subject of analysis at the Cleveland School of Character Diagnosis, a clinic interested in the personalities of high achievers. She made piano roll recordings of works by Liszt, Chopin, Schumann, Scriabin, Chabrier, Arensky, Massenet, Fauré, and Saint-Saens in the 1920s, and performed at New York's Hippodrome in 1925. She played for Benito Mussolini at his Villa Torlonia in 1926, while she was pregnant with her first child. By the following year, they were understood to be lovers, and he demanded that she forgo further musical performances, and forbid the Italian press from covering any events where she performed. There were rumors that she was a French spy, and she was at risk from others in Mussolini's confidence. In 1933, she opened a music school in Turin. She was director of the \\"Accademia della musica\\" from 1933 to 1943. She was arrested in 1945, but freed after intervention from French diplomats, and returned to Paris after the war. She taught Italian in a private school later in life.  Personal life  Magdeleine Brard first married in 1920, to Edmondo Michele Borgo, a wealthy Italian businessman. The Borgos separated in 1936. She had three children, Reginaldo (born 1926), the son of Edmondo Borgo; Vanna (born 1932), believed to be the biological daughter of Benito Mussolini; and Micaela (born 1942), the daughter of Swiss businessman Enrico Wild, whom Brard married in 1945. Wild died in 1955. Magdeleine Brard died in 1998, aged 94 years.

Background and Election Abdul Kader Kan was approximately fifty years old when he was inaugurated as the Almaami of Futa Toro. Before ascending to this position, Kan had been an independent qadi operating near Bundu who had been educated in Kajoor. He came from a line of Islamic scholars; his grandfather Lamin had performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, and his father Hamady studied the Qur'an in Futa Jallon. David Robinson, \\"Abdul Qadir and Shaykh Umar: A Continuing Tradition of Islamic Leadership in Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Studies, Vol 6. No 2 (1973), p. 286 – via JStor. He studied under Moktar Ndumbe Diop, who founded a school at Coki. David Robinson, \\"The Islamic Revolution of Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No 2 (1975), p. 191 Abdul Kader Kan was one of the candidates for the successor of Sulayman Bal, who had led the revolt with the intention of overthrowing the Deeñanke ruling class. According to Ware, his nomination came after the refusal of the position by another cleric, and his own acceptance was hesitant until Sulayman was killed in battle. Ware attributes this hesitation to the “pious distance” from political power traditionally kept by Senegambian clerics. Rudolph T. Ware III, The Walking Qur'an, p. 125 Robinson cites what he describes as a more obscure tradition, in which Abdul Kadeer Kan was elected after a longer period of political confusion, and that the torodbe leadership was unsure if they wanted to elect a leader as an Almaami, which would have acted as an explicit declaration for a desire to establish a separate Islamic state. David Robinson, \\"The Islamic Revolution of Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No 2 (1975), p. 194-195 Abdul Kader Kan was inaugurated as the Almaami in 1776. Robinson describes a “remarkable continuity with Denyanke installations and similarities with procedures adopted in the Muslim state of Futa Jallon”: Kan was kept in seclusion for a week as sacrifices of livestock were made on his behalf. He was then given a turban signifying his office by a cleric who had served as an advisor to the previous regime. David Robinson, \\"The Islamic Revolution of Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No 2 (1975), p. 196 At least fifty chiefs swore an oath of loyalty to him at this ceremony. One source states that ceremony involved the full recitation of the Qur’an, the ‘Ishriniyyat, and the Dala'il al-Khayrat, with Kan making the clerics who recited them promise to correct him if they saw him failing to live up to the standards set by each work.Rudolph T. Ware III, The Walking Qur'an, p. 125 This information comes from an account citing an earlier record that is no longer extant. David Robinson, \\"The Islamic Revolution of Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No 2 (1975), p. 196 Hostility to the Slave Trade Based on the letters written by Thomas Clarkson, at least one scholar has made the argument that the reverend believed that Abdul Kader Kan had completely abolished the slave trade in Futa Toro. One such letter describes Kan as \\"the wise and virtuous Almaamy\\" who provides an \\"illustrious example in extirpating the commerce in the human race.\\"Rudolph T. Ware III, The Walking Qur'an, p. 116 A treaty had been signed which was meant to prevent the French from selling the people of Futa Toro into slavery,Rudolph T. Ware III, The Walking Qur'an, p. 127 and the Almaami's success against the Emirate of Trarza may have been the result of Abdul Kader Kan's willingness to release the slaves of their slaves upon defeat. It has been noted that, while definitive proof of this strategy as a reason for the campaign's success cannot be provided, the promise of releasing the slaves who fought against their masters was a common strategy in Africa as well as America at this time.Rudolph T. Ware III, The Walking Qur'an, p. 126 The characterization of the Almaami as an abolitionist is not uncontested. Others characterize his policy of slavery as simply more in accord with traditional Islamic slavery; that is to say that while Muslims could not be legally enslaved, nonbelievers were still licit for enslavement. Though French slave traders were not allowed to either enslave the inhabitants of the Futa Toro nor transport slaves through the territory of the Imamate, the inhabitants themselves still owned slaves. According to this understanding, the inhabitants of Futa Toro were not protected because of a general hostility to slavery, but rather because the Almaami's subjects were at least by definition Muslim.David Robinson, \\"The Islamic Revolution of Futa Toro\\", The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 8, No 2 (1975), p. 201 References Category:1806 deaths Category:18th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Fula people Category:1720s births ","title":"Abdul Kader (almami)"},{"id":"62564211","text":"Tom Wright is an American curler.

It is defined by data created, collected and accumulated through advanced information, communication technology infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI). It is a society in which value is created and progress is achieved through the technology and data collection. Data, knowledge and information hold greater value compared to traditional production factors (labor and capital) in this type of society. As technology advances and automation increases, intelligent machines eventually replace human cognitive capabilities. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the convergence of artificial intelligence, robot technology, big data and software disrupts fields such as labor, welfare, employment, education and defense. This has sparked revolutionary change across society.  Examples  * AI home appliances solve housework. *Autonomous vehicles increase mobility and safely . *AI healthcare predicts the onset of disease.  Soft Power  An intelligent information society is a society where humans and things are connected through intelligence. The economy moves from a material economy to a service economy and then to a shared economy. Governance changes from vertical hierarchical order. Joseph Nye proposed the concept of soft power, which is is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). Soft power is more important than hard power in the intelligent information society. South Korea has been promoting hard power-oriented national strategies and economic growth. Nye argued that the proliferation of knowledge and networks in information shifted the center of power from hard to soft. Rather than coercion, restraint, and rewards, they dominate the other person's mind and persuade them.Nye, 2004 The intelligent information society forms the inflection point as the world shifts from hard power to soft power.  Economy  The economy of the intelligent information society relies on the digital economy. The Internet of Things (IoT), is a driving force for economic growth, discovering more creative, lower cost and innovative services. IoT creates value through collaboration between industries. It creates added value by applying IoT to fields such as automotive, medical, energy and power. Companies change from selling products to subscription services. Social production is a way of producing a product or service through a voluntary, open and horizontal collaboration. It uses a mixture of the capitalist market and sharing economy. Goods such as cars, homes, furniture, and clothing are shared through social media, unions, and redistribution clubs. Transaction costs for sharing products, services, and the content decline, enabling efficient use. Jeremy Rifkin claims that social capital is as important as financial capital, that access replaces ownership, and thatcooperation replaces competition..  Platform society  The platform underlying the Industrial Revolution was factories. What can be seen as a fourth revolution is centered on an intelligent computing platform. The Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence, and virtual reality are realizations of such advancements. Intelligence is shrinking economies of scale, and small-scale services and products become practical. This can contribute to quality of life via personalized services that reflect the individual consumer's situation. Heterarchical democracy is a consensual system in which states, citizens, and markets share power. Big data is its foundation. Big data is the foundation for citizens to become 'informed citizens' by providing them with unlimited information. Thus, citizens with big data-based information become pro-users who are both producers and suppliers of policies as well as users and operators of policies. It is to enable sharing to be realized.  Future  Care must be taken to ensure that the new form of democracy on which big data is based, is not a \\"big data brother\\" in which big data is used to enable autocratic power. Checks and balances complemented by open civil society participation can prevent government or other concentrated power to dominate. Korean society from the 1960s to the early 1980s was represented by industrialization, followed by a period focused on improving the social quality of life. The intelligent information society takes this as a central task. Governments, industry and civil society should cooperatively define how the society is to operate.

Career After graduating from Furman University in 2014 with a degree in Communications Studies, Stuckey worked as a publicist and social media strategist in Athens, Georgia. While working as a publicist in Georgia, she began speaking to college students about the importance of voting and, in 2016, started a blog on a Facebook page called The Conservative Millennial. In 2017, she joined TheBlaze as a contributor and began appearing as a guest on Fox News and Fox Business News while continuing to speak on college campuses, to Republican organizations, and to businesses about the importance of engaging young people. In late 2017, she left The Blaze and to start a podcast distributed by Conservative Review TV (CRTV). Stuckey launched her podcast Relatable in March of 2018 with CRTV. In 2019, CRTV and TheBlaze merged to become BlazeTV, which now distributes Relatable. In July 2018, Stuckey released a video on her CRTV Facebook page that depicted a satirical interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in which the politician appeared to give bizarre answers to the questions she was asked by Stuckey. The video used edited footage from an interview Ocasio-Cortez had previously done on the PBS show Firing Line, and spliced Ocasio-Cortez's answers as responses to Stuckey's questions. The video went viral, with many people labeling the video as a hoax. On her Twitter page, Stuckey responded to the backlash by writing, \\"If you have to do research to figure out that a video that blatantly absurd is satirical, you shouldn’t be on the Internet.\\" Stuckey claimed that she was surprised by the response to the video, and that \\"A lot of people on the left just can’t tolerate someone on the right making a joke, because the only humor now that is protected is humor that is against conservatives or against President Trump.\\" In September 2019, Stuckey spoke at Congressman Dan Crenshaw's inaugural Youth Summit in Houston. On November 14, 2019, Stuckey testified as an expert witness before the House of Representatives in a hearing called \\"Examining State Efforts to Undermine Access to Reproductive Care\\" held by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on the issue of abortion in Missouri. Stuckey was the sole witness to testify for the Republicans. Stuckey's first book, You're Not Enough (And That's Okay): Escaping the Toxic Culture of Self-Love, is published by Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Random House, and was released May 5, 2020.

Due to its weak economic situation, Guizhou warlords were typically dependent on more economically successful warlords such as the Yunnan clique and the Hunan warlords. The Guizhou warlords were very much focused on family relations, especially the Xingyi clique warlords under the Liu family. These family connections formed the core of Guizhou political power for a long time. The first Guizhou warlord in power was Liu Xianshi, heading the Liu family and the Old Xingyi clique. With the invasion of Guizhou by Yunnan general Tang Jiyao, Liu's enemies were defeated and Guizhou started a lasting relationship with Yunnan and especially Tang Jiyao. Liu Xianshi's nephew, Wang Wenhua, disagreed with much of what Liu did, and was in conflict with him, using student organizations to agitate against him. He staged the Minjiu Incident, which forced Liu to resign his posts as military and civilian governor. Liu fled to Xingyi, with Wang fleeing to Shanghai, finally being assassinated by Liu's supporters in March 1921. Liu Xianshi was thus restored to power in Guizhou, and the rivalry between uncle and nephew ended. The Guizhou warlords did not participate in many wars or expansions aside from assisting their allies in the Yunnan clique with their expansion into Sichuan. The main power base of the Guizhou warlords shifted from Xingyi to the provincial capital, Guiyang, as warlords changed. Origins Liu family Liu Xianshi, Guizhou clique leader The Qian clique originated with Liu Xianshi and his family. Born in Xingyi, Guizhou, Liu was born to a landlord family. His cousin, Liu Xianqian, was also an important leader of the Guizhou warlords.Xia, Zhengnong, Chen, Zhili, et al. Great Cihai: Chinese Modern History, Shanghai Cishu Press, Shanghai, 2013. Liu Xianshi's father, Liu Guanli, had been a regiment commander when suppressing a Hui uprising. Due to this, he rose quickly within the ranks, elevating the Liu family to a hegemonic force within Guizhou. The Liu family would be one of the major forces in the early Guizhou clique, with many of its members holding important positions in the military. Their power base was Xingyi, where they lived. In 1902, the Guangxi Huidang army entered Guizhou and captured the city of Xingyi. Liu Guanli, Liu Xianshi, and Liu Xianqian took the opportunity to raise the local District Watch Force, and cooperated with the Qing army to recover the city, receiving an award for his actions.Guizhou Province Xingyi Prefecture Government Council Historical Resources Work Division. History of Xingyi Prefecture, Vol. 15. Guiyang, 1983. With Liu Guanli's old age, Liu Xianshi inherited his father's mantle. Liu Xianshi was known as a \\"smiling tiger\\", for being much more vicious than his father. An antithetical couplet was written and posted on the door of Liu's Defense Corps Bureau.Hu, Bo. Kangzhan Shiqi de Qianjun Zuozhan Xiaozhi (History of the Guizhou Army During the Anti-Japanese War Era). Ch. 10 (Qianxi). Revolution After the outbreak of the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, governor Shen Yuqing went into a state of panic, and Liu Xianshi entered the provincial capital in an emergency effort to suppress the revolution. He immediately recruited people to march into the provincial capital.Liu, Xianshi. Shedding light on Guizhou, Southeast. However, while Liu Xianshi was on the way, Zhang Bailin, leader of the Guizhou Tongmenghui and Ren Kecheng, the local constitutionalist leader, as well as many others, forced Shen Yuqing to step down on November 4, declaring the independence of Guizhou.Feng, Zuyi, Cao, Weijing, and Wei, Yishen. Xinhai Revolution: Guizhou Encyclopedia. Guizhou People's Press, Guiyang, 2011. The Guizhou New Army instructor and lecturer Wu Tang as well as Chief of the Army Primary School Yang Yicheng were recommended to become the governors of the Guizhou military government. Zhao Dequan was to be the Vice Governor, Zhang Bailin the Dean of the Privy Council, Ren Kecheng the Vice President, and Zhou Peiyi as Secretary-General and Chief Executive Officer. However, the revolutionaries, known as the Self-Government Study Society, failed to take effective measures to consolidate their positions. Instead, they adopted a compromising approach to the constitutionalists and the old bureaucrats. Shen Yuqing was sent to towns to suppress the revolution. Liu Xianshi was appointed Chief of Staff of the Privy Council, and a provisional (constitution preparatory) council was established. Ren Kecheng, Zhang Bailin, and old bureaucrat Guo Chongguang worked from inside the Privy Council to suppress the revolution. They ordered Dujun (military governor) Yang Yicheng to lead his army North, and for the Dean, Zhang Bailin, to leave the provincial capital to visit various places. At the beginning of February 1912, they killed Huang Zelin, a local Tongmenghui and provincial capital law enforcement leader. Zhang Bailin, upon returning to Guiyang, had to escape due to the threat of being killed.Nanming Region Information Center. Zhang Bailin, the Most Meritorious Leader in the Xinhai Revolution in Guizhou. Yunnanese invasion Yunnanese leaders of the National Protection War, featuring many who were involved in the Yunnan clique during the invasion of Guizhou Although the revolution had been greatly weakened, Ren Kecheng, Liu Xianshi, Guo Chongguang, and other counter- revolutionaries felt that their power was insufficient and they dared not to launch a coup and seize power. As per Guo Chongguang's suggestion, they decided to send Dai Kan to Yunnan to look for Cai E, the governor of Yunnan, to invade Guizhou and \\"Stop the Guizhou Chaos\\", trying to slanderize the military government and the revolutionaries of Guizhou. After a bit of hesitation, Cai E decided to send Tang Jiyao, then an intermediate officer of the Yunnan army whose troops were situated in the North of Yunnan, to enter Guizhou and settle the divides in the Guizhou government. At this time, Zhong Changying, one of the leaders of the Guizhou Tongmenghui, passed through Kunming from Nanjing to return to Guizhou. When he heard the news of the invasion, he urged Cai E not to interfere in the internal affairs of Guizhou Province. Cai E, heeding the advice, ordered Tang Jiyao to divert his army's path into Sichuan and then into Hubei, but Tang Jiyao had been promised the position of governorship by the reactionary forces in Guizhou. Tang reported that his front team had entered Guizhou and was unable to change course, so they had to go deep into Guizhou. Zhong Changying chased the army in an attempt to persuade Tang Jiyao to change course, but he was assassinated in Anshun.One of the Leaders of the Xinhai Revolution in Guizhou - Zhong Changying.Zhong Changying, An Explanation of Zhong Changying. In early March 1912, Tang Jiyao led the Yunnan Army into Guiyang. At first, the revolutionary government was tricked into believing that Tang's forces were simply passing through Guizhou on their way to aid revolutionary forces in Central China.McCord, Edward A. Military Force and Elite Power in the Formation of Modern China. Routledge, 2014. However, aided by Liu Xianshi, Tang launched a coup against the military government and became the military governor.People's Government of Yunnan Portal. Tang Jiyao.Worthing, Peter.

Thus, the Guizhou government fell into the hands of Tang Jiyao, the Constitutionalists, and the old bureaucrats. However, the people of Guizhou, especially the revolutionaries, were extremely opposed to the invasion of Guizhou, calling Tang Jiyao and his army \\"Dian Kou\\" (Yunnanese Enemy). The Book of Guizhou's Complaints to the Compatriots of All Cities in Guizhou was published in Chongqing, the Bloody Records of Guizhou were issued in Beijing, and Guizhou Tears of Blood was published in Wuchang. Yuan Shikai, then President of China, tried to intervene in the name of the central government, but his attempt was useless.People's Government of Yunnan History Committee. Yunnan History Selected Resources: Vol. 10. Yunnan People's Press, Kunming, 1989, p. 100. Guizhou under Tang Jiyao Tang Jiyao, military governor of Guizhou On March 4, 1912, Tang Jiyao became military governor of Guizhou, recognized in May 1912 by Beijing, with Liu Xianshi assuming the role of Minister of War. Tang consolidated his power by disbanding and massacring revolutionary forces in Guizhou. Tang Jiyao and Liu Xianshi militarily ruled Guizhou jointly, with Liu commanding a new Citizen's Army, and Liu's allies becoming responsible for the civil administration of Guizhou. This brought the revolutionaries to an end and paved the way for the taking of full political power by the Liu family. Due to the sharing of power with Tang, Liu Xianshi's power was limited, but it would be rewarded with the removal of office of Cai E. In order to cultivate military talent, Tang Jiyao founded the Guizhou Military Academy, with Han Fenglou, a Yunnanese general, serving as its head. Many of the heads of the Academy were alumni of the Yunnan Military Academy. Graduates of the Academy became commanders and officers in the Yunnan and Guizhou armies, deployed in rotation. In order to turn Guizhou into his own fiefdom, Tang Jiyao forbade the introduction of foreign progressive ideas, actively supported local forces and ideas, and established the Guizhou Unification Party as an organization to cement his power. Key members of the Guizhou Unification Party were Liu Xianshi, Ren Kecheng, Dai Kan, He Linshu, and Guo Chongguang, although many others played an important part in this party. Tang used the Guizhou Unification Party to prevent the development of the Kuomintang in Guizhou and to preserve his rule.

Retrieved 12-6-2019. to take up his position as governor, power fell into the hands of Liu Xianshi, who assumed his position of military governor (Dujun). A young He Yingqin, member of the Liu family With Yuan Shikai's declaration of the Empire of China, the National Protection War broke out. Liu Xianshi initially stayed neutral, but when the situation became urgent, he had to declare Guizhou's independence on January 27, 1916. Liu Xianshi held a military conference and decided to send the Yunnan Army Artillery Team, the Mechanical Team, and the 5th and 6th regiments of the Guizhou army. The 6th Regiment served as the right flank of the 1st Army of the National Protection Army. In June, after Yuan Shikai's death, Beijing appointed Liu to the position of Dujun, with Dai Kan becoming the civil governor. In August, Dai was transferred to the Office of Military Affairs of Sichuan, with the post of civil governor passed on to Liu Xianshi. Liu Xianshi consolidated his military and civil political power in Guizhou and implemented internal military rule. He supported Tang Jiyao's expansion into Sichuan, and formed and lead the Guizhou clique.Huaxia Weijing. Liu Xianshi. Retrieved 12-6-2019. As the Liu family hailed from Xingyi, their group is called the Xingyi clique to differentiate them from the Tongzi clique, which would be led by Zhou Xicheng. The Xingyi clique itself was split into the Old and New factions. Liu Xianshi, with Liu Xianzhi, Liu Xianqian, and other members of the Liu family formed the backbone of the Old Xingyi clique, and Xiong Fanyu, He Linshu, Zhang Xielu, and Guo Chongguang were called the \\"Four Pillars\\" of the clique. Xiong Fanyu was responsible for helping the Liu family with their schooling during the late Qing, and was the father-in-law of Liu Xianshi's son, Liu Gongliang, as well as serving as Liu Xianshi's secretary and the leader of the Guizhou branch of the Bank of China. He Linshu was one of the main leaders of the Constitutionalists in Guizhou and the father-in-law to Liu Xianshi's second son, Liu Junzhuo, who served as the director of the Guizhou Government Office. Zhang Xielu, who helped the Liu family with schooling in Xingyi, served as the director of the Finance Department under Liu Xianshi. These \\"Pillars\\" became the backbone for an organization of merchants and landlords in Guizhou known as the Qilaohui. Liu used his son, Liu Gangwu, as his emissary to Sun Yat-Sen. Liu Xianqian was placed into power in Western Guizhou, placing him in direct control of Xingyi. Wang Wenhua, Liu's nephew, rose to the position of division commander. Wang's brother-in- law, He Yingqin, was a brigade commander as well as Chief of Staff in the Guizhou army. Wang's older brother, Wang Boqun, served as Liu's emissary.Esherick, Joseph W. and Rankin, Mary Backus. Chinese Local Elites and Patterns of Dominance, University of California Press, 2018. . While in power, Liu Xianshi expanded his army greatly. During a political crisis in 1916, Liu sent 400000 yuan to Shanghai from his treasury as an emergency fund in case he lost power. Liu Xianzhi and Liu Xianqian were each accused for taking 200000 yuan from Guizhou public funds. Liu–Wang conflict Wang Wenhua, a progressive reformer in the Guizhou clique basing his power in the military, opposed to Liu Xianshi, his uncle. Wang Wenhua's position had gone from division commander to commander-in-chief of the Guizhou army. Despite receiving no formal military training, Wang rose up through the ranks due to his relationship with the Liu family. Evidence suggests that the Liu and Wang clans of Guizhou had conflicts in the past, and that it was resolved through marriage, making Wang Wenhua Liu Xianshi's nephew. Wang also married one of Liu's nieces, strengthening their ties. However, even though Liu and Wang were close, they had political differences. Wang was an avid supporter of the revolutionaries, with progressive views similar to those of Sun Yat-sen. During the National Protection War, while Liu had been reluctant to fully commit to the war, Wang was strong in his support for Cai E and the anti-Yuan forces. Wang had even told Liu that he would lead troops into Sichuan, and that Liu could save himself by saying that Wang had rebelled and was acting outside of his control. Liu finally agreed to let Wang go to Sichuan.Chen, Xianqiu. A Record of Guizhou Political and Military Events in the 25 Years Following the 1911 Revolution. Historical Sources Selected Works 15, pp. 143-169. Wang had previously joined the Kuomintang (then known as the Chinese Revolutionary Party) during a 1917 visit to Shanghai. Wang was unhappy with politics in Guizhou, and many members of the Liu family complained to Liu Xianshi about his tolerance of Wang and warned him of Wang being too powerful militarily. These warnings were largely ignored by Liu. Liu did, however, have a separate military force under the command of Liu Xianqian. Wang, as commander-in-chief, chose his subordinates based on their similar political views to him. Wang looked for people who had military training and could help him modernize Guizhou. Along with his brother Wang Boqun, Wang gathered a group of young officers from Guizhou who had studied at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, who had, while studying in Japan, started to support Sun Yat-sen's views. Among these officers was He Yingqin, who would later become an important part of the Republic of China Army under Chiang Kai-shek. Wang Wenhua believed in reform to better his home province, especially with a stronger military. He attempted to use his military power in Guizhou to implement Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary program, leading to the distinction between the Civilian Faction of Liu Xianshi and the Military Faction of Wang Wenhua, the former of which was made up of Xinhai-era reformers, and the latter of which was made up of May Fourth-era military professionals.Gui, Baizhu. Random Notes on the Internal Struggles of the Liu Xianshi Clique. Guizhou Historical Sources Selected Works 1, pp. 98-114. At the center of Wang's plan was the Guizhou Military Academy, formed at the end of the Qing Empire. In 1917, Wang was successful in recruiting able young officers, and he rejected applications from candidates with relations to Liu Xianshi. In August 1917, Liu Xianshi and Liu Xianqian established a separate military academy in Xingyi called the Suiying School. The Suiying school and the Guizhou Military Academy had an intense rivalry, with the Suiying school having many instructors that were not well-educated on military affairs and who had never had any battlefield experience. In contrast, the Guizhou Military Academy, with its Japanese-style military education, was so popular it even began to draw students from neighboring provinces. Wang expelled many students who were caught spying for the Suiying school and passing information about the inner workings of the Guizhou Military Academy to Liu Xianshi, with Wang and He going to great lengths to carefully examining candidates. The Suiying school, due to its worse quality, only produced 2 classes of graduates before closing. The Guizhou Military Academy had He as the commandant, and had produced 495 graduates by 5 years.Worthing, Peter. General He Yingqin: The Rise and Fall of Nationalist China. Cambridge University Press, 2016. pp. 25-26. Another important factor in Wang Wenhua's support was his endorsement of the Guizhou student movement. With influence from the New Culture Movement, newspapers in Guizhou by 1917 had started to print articles on Western ideas. Students began to discuss politics and ideology or demand for the curricula to be reformed to add certain subjects. In late 1918, Wang Wenhua and He Yingqin created a new student organization named the Young Guizhou Association, inspired by the Young China Students' Association in BeijingXiong, Zongren. (1986) The May Fourth Movement in Guizhou. Guizhou People's Press, Guiyang, 1986. (which had been created in June) and modeled on Giuseppe Mazzini's Young Italy.Xiong, Zongren. He Yingqin - History in the Vortex. Guizhou People's Press, Guiyang, 2001 The Young Guizhou Association called for students to call for the modernization of the province, increasing Wang's political power and taking the Liu–Wang conflict from the military scene to the student and civilian scene. He Yingqin was the nominal director of the movement, while Wang worked behind the scenes to hide his involvement. He described in his speeches the purpose of the movement - that Guizhou was an \\"old, sick man\\" and that the young would have to revitalize it. The main message of the Young Guizhou Association was this: In response to the creation of the Young Guizhou Association, Liu Xianshi created his own student organization, named the Republic of China Patriotic Students' Association, with much of its message taken from the Young Guizhou Association, in order to turn young people away from Wang Wenhua and He Yingqin's student organization. In early March 1919, the Young Guizhou Association started publishing the Young Guizhou Association Daily newspaper, which advocated for political and social change in Guizhou and became one of the leading voices of reformist and revolutionary activism. Liu Xianshi, at the time, attended a rally held jointly by the Young Guizhou Association as well as the Patriotic Students' Association. By spring 1919, the Young Guizhou Association completely dominated the Guizhou student movement. With influence from events in Beijing and the Treaty of Versailles, Guizhou students in Hunan organized a National Salvation Association, with 600 members. Wang Wenhua himself saw the Beijing Government's foreign policy as a failure due to the Shandong Problem.Chen, Zhongping. The May Fourth Movement and Provincial Warlords: A Reexamination. In Modern China, Vol. 37, No. 2 (March 2011), pp. 135-169. Students of the Institute of Law and Politics in Guiyang considered making a Guizhou branch of the National Student Alliance, which happened in June as representatives from national student movement alliances came to Guiyang. In May 1919, Young Guizhou Association leaders met with representatives from 81 counties in order to create a new representative body for the Guizhou student movement named the Guizhou National People's Assembly, with more than 1000 people attending its first session in June. When the May Fourth Movement spread to Guiyang, He Yingqin, as well as Zhang Pengnian, Zhang Xielu's brother and Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Assembly, went to the National Citizen's Meeting in Guiyang on June 1, 1919. He led the Young Guizhou Association in a parade and delivered a keynote speech at the meeting. Liu Xianshi attempted to limit the Young Guizhou Association's influence as it was becoming a political threat to him. Zhang Xielu's brother, Zhang Pengnian, who was the director of Nanming Middle School, convened the school body to warn them against political activism. He recommended to the students that they save the nation through studying instead of demonstration. He banned all student activities that were not approved by him. Likewise, Liu Xianshi's cousin, Liu Jingwu, who was the president of the Institute of Law and Politics, reprimanded his students in a similar way. Liu Xianshi also made it so that students could not graduate or move up grades if they missed at least one third of their classes. Wang Boqun, who was an emissary of Liu Xianshi, met Zhao Shijin, an overseas Chinese man who had previously helped Sun Yat-sen with funding infrastructure projects in China. Wang talked to Zhao about a plan to build a railroad from Chongqing to Luzhou through Guiyang. Zhao agreed to raise 5 million dollars to fund the project, signing an agreement in March 1919 which said that the Guizhou Provincial Assembly would have to authorize the construction of the railway within 3 months. Liu Xianshi initially supported the project, but Wang Wenhua proposed that 1 out of the 5 million sent would be used for the army. Some others proposed that the money would be used for completely different things. Zhang Xielu and Chen Tingce, Liu's supporters, were dissatisfied with Wang's proposal due to their dislike of Wang's growing political power as well as the unwillingness to take on too much debt. Zhang demanded that the loan would be restricted to 2 million dollars, and for the money only to be applied for infrastructure investments. Zhang, in a several hundred page long report, detailed his opposition to the loan and to the railroad, which changed Liu's mind.Zhang, Pengnian (n.d.). The Evolution of Guizhou Politics in the Forty Years Since the 1911 Revolution, Part 1. Guizhou Wenshi Ziliao Xuanji (Guizhou Historical Resources Selected Works) 2, pp.40-46. Wang Wenhua and He Yingqin had formed a committee for the renovation of the Guizhou provincial government. They persuaded Ren Kecheng to chair the committee, who proposed that Liu Xianshi step down as military governor (Dujun) and appoint Wang in his stead, keeping Liu as civilian governor and handing over military power to Wang. Liu was furious and rejected the proposals, leading to a further divide between Liu and Wang. By late 1919, Wang had been using force to attack people who had disagreed with the loan and railroad project. It was, by then, clear that Wang was determined to remove Liu from power, but was kept from doing so, possibly from familial relations. In late 1919, the Young Guizhou Association launched a campaign against Zhang Xielu, denouncing him in a demonstration. His home was broken into, and many soldiers had joined in the demonstration. Another major protest against Zhang was planned to be on December 3, 1919, where local beggars would join in a mob to participate in a \\"Poor People's Conference\\" calling for Zhang's trial. The Young Guizhou Association Daily published several articles on Zhang's alleged mishandling of provincial finance. Wang plotted against Chen Tingce, sending an assassin after him. After a banquet at Wang Wenhua's house attended by multiple leaders of the Guizhou clique (including Liu Xianshi) to discuss provincial affairs on November 26, 1919, an assassin shot twice at Chen at 11p.m., leaving him wounded. The would-be-assassin was never caught. The Minjiu Incident Setup Lu Tao, photographed March 1921 A map of Minjiu Incident troop movement approximations In early 1920, the Guizhou army accompanied Tang Jiyao in his invasion of Sichuan against then-governor of Sichuan Xiong Kewu. Wang Wenhua led the army, staying for several months in the province. Tang Jiyao shared Liu Xianshi's distaste for Wang - Some sources claim that Tang sent a secret telegram to Liu, saying that Wang was unfit for command due to his lack of any formal military training and his over-reliance on his subordinate officers. Other sources claim that Liu wanted to remove Wang himself, and initiated the plan to remove him.Guizhou University History Department. Guizhou Junfa Liu Xianshi Fajia Shi (A History of the Rise of the Family of Guizhou Warlord Liu Xianshi), Guizhou Historical Resources Selected Works 3, pp. 186-200. Nevertheless, Wang Wenhua learned of the plot. He conversed with two of his subordinates, Zhu Shaoliang and Gu Zhenglun, about the plan to remove Liu Xianshi from power. Wang told Liu that he was withdrawing his troops from Sichuan due to a Yunnanese withdrawal. He ordered deputy commander Lu Tao to take the army back South to Guiyang to \\"sweep out the princes\\" and dismantle Liu Xianshi's power, while Wang himself sailed to Shanghai.Lin, Zixian. Guizhou \\"Minjiu Shibian\\" Qinliji (A Personal Record of the Guizhou \\"Minjiu Incident\\"). Guizhou Historical Resources Selected Works 1, pp. 148-163. Zhang Pengnian claims that before he left, Wang drew up two lists of names with Gu - one for those who were to be immediately assassinated, and the other for those who would be observed and possibly killed in the future. In October 1920, Guizhou forces left for Guiyang through Zunyi. Gu Zhenglun ordered Sun Jianfeng to lead his troops to Guiyang, to where he arrived in early November. On November 10, Sun met with He Yingqin to look over the assassination list. He Yingqin favored cutting the list down, but Sun favored adding names to the list in order to destroy Liu Xianshi's faction easier. Provincial assemblyman Zhang Shiren was invited to mediate, and the list was finalized to four people - Guo Chongguang, Xiong Fanyu, He Linshu, and Ding Yizhong, the \\"four pillars\\" of the Old Xingyi Clique. After they were dead, Wang Wenhua planned to force Liu Xianshi to step down from his post as governor. Liu Xianshi, through his spies, learned that there was a plot against him. However, he did not know of the details. To keep himself safe, he ordered Zhang Xianqian to take his troops from Xingyi to Guiyang. Liu also consulted Yuan Zuming, one of his supporters who was a subordinate of Wang Wenhua, to sow disorder from within Wang's faction. Execution On the night of November 10, 1920, random shots were fired in random parts of Guiyang, starting the coup. Wang's soldiers blocked the streets. Sun Jianfeng had designated different squads to capture the men on the assassination list. When taking Guo Chongguang away, the squad assigned to him claimed that Liu Xianshi wanted to see him. When his young son cried and complained that his father was being taken away, a soldier shot the boy in the head. Guo was taken to a bridge outside the North gate of Guiyang, where they set him on a butcher's table and beheaded him. The squad assigned to Xiong Fanyu had scared Xiong, who believed they were robbers. Xiong asked them to take anything but to not do harm, to which a soldier replied that they had come to take his life, but not his belongings. Xiong was taken into his courtyard and also beheaded. He Linshu, hearing the initial shots of the coup, climbed over his neighbor's wall, where he hid. The squad that was to kill him instead took his two sons and his nephew, beheading them in the street. He later returned to his house and snuck out of Guiyang, pretending to be a diseased man in a palanquin. Ding Yizhong hid in his house and fled the city. Sun Jianfeng put the heads of Guo Chengguang and Xiong Fanyu in a barrel, sending them to Gu Zhenglun. Gu later ordered the heads to be publicly shown and spoke about the \\"crimes\\" they had committed against Guizhou. Aftermath Liu Xianshi spent the entirety of the Minjiu incident in his own compound. Over the next few days following the death of his allies, surrounded by his private guards, Liu learnt of the fates of his associates. Liu, seeing the danger to his life, resigned his positions and returned to Xingyi. Liu was at first held back, but he threatened that he would kill himself unless he was allowed to go. He then turned to ask his sister (Wang Wenhua's mother) for her protection, persuading Wang's faction to let him go on November 18, and personally accompanying him to Anshun, and then Xingyi. At Anshun, Liu met with Liu Xianqian and his army, going on to Xingyi. Sun Jianfeng ordered Lin Zixian to assassinate him on the way, which he refused to do. He Yingqin quickly put into action the next phase of the plan, which was installing Ren Kecheng as acting governor until Wang Wenhua returned. However, Ren refused to participate in the plan and fled to Anshun. He was found by soldiers and taken back to Guiyang, but he escaped again, this time hiding in a Catholic church with Xiong Fanyu's brother and Chen Tingce. With Ren gone, the post of acting provincial governor was given to Zhou Hongbin. Gui Baizhu claims that instead of Zhou, Lu Tao was installed as acting provincial governor. Wang Wenhua, in Shanghai, stayed away from the chaos in Guizhou. He had brought funds with him so that he could strengthen and equip the Guizhou army. Liu's supporters went to Shanghai with him, and in March 1921, as Wang stepped into a car outside his hotel, assassins sent by Yuan Zuming shot and killed him, ending the Liu-Wang conflict. Liu Xianshi, who had fled to Kunming, returned to Guiyang in April 1923 with Yunnanese troops, who restored him to power. Rule of Yuan Zuming Yuan Zuming, former subordinate of Liu Xianshi and governor of Guizhou In April 1920, Yuan Zuming, receiving financial support from Beijing, organized the Qianding Army in Wuchang and served as its commander-in-chief. In April 1922, Yuan expelled Lu Tao, who was supported by the Southern government, from Guiyang. Yuan, occupying Guiyang, claimed the position of commander-in-chief of the Guizhou Army. In August, he assumed the title of civilian governor of Guizhou. However, he gradually came into conflict with Tang Jiyao. In April 1923, Tang Jiyu, Tang Jiyao's brother, led the Yunnan Army to occupy Guiyang, assuming his position as Governor. Yuan was expelled from Guizhou and fled to Sichuan, where he fought with the Sichuan clique warlords. In March 1924, Yuan was appointed to the Sichuan-Guizhou Border Inspection Office by the government in Beijing and made the Chief of the 34th Division.Zhu, Youchun.

The novel, based on his childhood under Japanese occupation, became highly influential in Communist China. More than six million copies of the book were printed, and it was translated into over 20 languages. A short story from the novel was adapted into a popular animated film, The Rooster Crows at Midnight. The villain of the story, a greedy landowner nicknamed Zhou Bapi (\\"Zhou the flayer\\"), became one of the most famous evil landlords in China.  Early life  Gao was born on 6 April 1927 into a poor peasant family in Sunjiatun Village in Fu County (now Wafangdian), Liaoning, Republic of China, and grew up under Japanese occupation. He entered school at age eight, but had to quit school to work after less than a month. When he was nine, his family moved to Dalian, where he worked as a child labourer. At age 15, he took up his sick father's job in a copper mine. After the surrender of Japan, Gao enlisted in the People's Liberation Army in November 1947, and joined the Communist Party of China the following year. During the Chinese Civil War, Gao fought in the Liaoshen campaign, the Pingjin campaign, and the , and was decorated six times.  Career  Uneducated and nearly illiterate, Gao began learning to read and write while in the army, and soon started to write his autobiographical novel Gao Yubao. In his manuscript, which is now displayed at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, he drew pictures and symbols to represent characters he could not write. In January 1951, he completed the first draft of the novel, with more than 200,000 characters. After much revision, the book was published in 1955. Due to Gao's illiteracy, much of the book was ghostwritten by the army writer Guo Yongjiang (), also known by the pen name Huang Cao (). In a letter to another author, Guo said that he had written 13 chapters of Gao Yubao. The story bears resemblance to the popular Soviet novel How the Steel Was Tempered. In 1954, Gao was admitted to Renmin University of China to receive a formal education. He graduated in 1962 from the university's Department of Journalism, and became a full-time military writer in the Shenyang Military Region with the rank of a division commander. In the following decades, he wrote novels such as I Am a Soldier and A Sequel to Gao Yubao, as well as essays, short stories, reportage literature, and poems. He was also a motivational speaker, making more than five thousand speeches to five million people in total. Gao died in Dalian on 5 December 2019, aged 92.  Influence and criticism  The novel Gao Yubao was highly influential in Communist China. It was translated into seven minority languages of China and fifteen foreign languages, and more than six million copies were printed in the next 50 years. Two short stories from the novel, entitled \\"The Rooster Crows at Midnight\\" and \\"I Want to Go to School\\", were used in primary school textbooks in China. \\"The Rooster Crows at Midnight\\" was adapted into a popular animated film. The villain of the story is a landlord named Zhou Chunfu (). Known by the nickname Zhou Bapi (\\"Zhou the flayer\\") in the story, he became one of the most famous evil landlords in Communist China. Although Gao Yubao is considered a novel, Gao claimed that the story was based on his real life experience. Zhou Chunfu was the name of a real landlord in Gao's village who had been beaten to death during the Land Reform Movement in the late 1940s. According to Zhou's great-grandson Meng Lingqian, however, the evil deeds attributed to Zhou were mostly made up, and the real Zhou was not even classified among the top 2,000 richest landlords in Fu County. However, the notoriety of the fictional Zhou Bapi caused severe hardship to Zhou Chunfu's descendants during Maoist China.

It was created as one of seven plays during the mid-1980’s based on short stories written by Anton Chekhov. offoffoff.com/theater/1999/muddrowning.php Fornés used his story as the framework upon which she built. Alongside Drowning Fornés also created her play Mud. Though both plays were not meant to be performed together, they were presented in modern syndication to portray the human consciousness dealing with self-awareness. At its core, Drowning shows the essence of Fornés’ work with a sense of alienation and her unique adaptive style. As stated in John Houseman’s foreword of Orchards, the collection of the seven plays, “The idea was not simply to adapt or dramatize the stories, but to use them as a cue for the creation of short theatrical pieces to be produced by the Company as part of its repertory season.” The idea for Drowning, when originally assigned to Fornés, was almost sent back because she felt that there was not enough of a story since there were only two or three pages of material to work with. washingtonpost.com Chekhov’s version of the story follows a man who makes a living by pretending to drown himself in front of wealthy clients for money. Even though Fornés did not understand the meaning behind the man drowning himself, she drew inspiration from the man’s loneliness and from having complete creative freedom to adapt the story as she wanted to. Fornés decided to turn the story into a short play about tragic love. In her adaptation of the story the main actors are wearing animal-like masks that resembled sea lions and heavily padded clothing to simulate the appearance of two grotesque men. The story would be viewed through the eyes of two patrons in the café watching the transition of the man as he falls in love with a woman in a newspaper photograph; the man consequently falls into a deep depression, which leads to him drowning himself with grief. Production History Drowning was originally performed as part of the Off-Off Broadway Theatre company in New York City as part of the avant-garde movement of the 1960s. http://philipglasscenter.org/2019-festival/a-tribute-to-maria-irene-fornes- mud-drowning/ It is currently one of eight plays being rehearsed and presented by The Acting Company. According to Houseman in his foreword of Orchards, the play has “appeared in thirty-four cities, where in many cases audiences had their first opportunity to see works by the seven playwrights.” Drowning was also performed at Pershing Square Signature Center, directed by Lila Neugebauer. Characters * Pea: One of the large and shapeless humanoids who wears an olive hat, a beige jacket, and greenish-brown pants. He falls in love with the woman in the newspaper and ultimately becomes dejected when she rejects him. * Roe: The other humanoid. He wears a brown hat and brown suit. He enlightens Pea on a variety of subjects with which the latter is unfamiliar. * Stephen: another humanoid. He is adorned with a brown hat, small checkered jacket, and brown pants. Notably, Stephen only has a single line in the play. “Humanoid” is simply a term to refer quickly to the characters, who, although they are not given specific labels, are described by Fornés in Scene 1. In Fornés’ description of Pea and Roe, she describes their heads as “large and shapeless, like potatoes.” She goes on, stating: “Their flesh is shiny and oily. Their eyes are reddish and watery. They have warts on their faces and necks. Their bodies are also like potatoes.” Plot Drowning is made up of only three scenes. It is a relatively short play. Scene 1 Pea and Roe sit in a cafe in Europe during the afternoon. They are sitting at a table, waiting for Stephen. On the table lies a folded newspaper. When Pea looks at it, he and Roe begin a dialogue about the paper, with Pea having not previously known what a newspaper is. Roe, the more knowledgeable one, informs his friend what it is. Pea spots the picture of a woman in the paper and a snowdrift and asks Roe what these things are. After defining what snow is, Roe then points to a snowman in the paper for the benefit of Pea. Pea is confused about what word to use for the snowman, at first describing it as “awkward,” and then, after Roe differs, saying he meant to say “strikingly wonderful” and “very well-made.” Pea is additionally confused about how the snowman is not a real man. Roe corrects him, saying that “he is an imitation of a man.” This ultimately leads Pea to question his own identity and what he is made of, as well as what Roe and the woman in the paper are made of. Pea decides he wants to meet the woman in the paper. Roe says her name is Jane Spivak. He knows her, but is uncertain if he would be able to introduce her to Pea. Stephen arrives. Scene 2 A few minutes after Scene 1 takes place. Pea, whose head is leaning on the table, is sleeping. Stephen and Roe talk about how Pea could not harm anyone and how they hope no harm comes to him. Scene 3 A month later. Pea is in the same seat, his shirt collar open and hat pushed back. He looks as if he has not slept well. Roe stands. Pea talks about all the qualities of Jane Spivak which he adores. He describes looking at her “as one looks at an animal.” He says that he loves her. Pea then laments how he looks, saying that he is a bat rather than a human. He tells Roe of the meeting with Jane Spivak. According to Pea, she had invited him to touch her, and when he did, she pushed him away and said, “You rub against me like a piece of meat.” She then told him not to rub against her anymore. Roe sympathizes with his friend. He touches Pea and says he is cold. He says how terrible it is to see such a young man destroyed and suffering like this. Pea takes out the newspaper from earlier from his jacket. He had thought having her picture would provide him with relief, but now sees that it does not provide relief. He puts his head on the table and questions why they came to live, love and hurt. Roe puts his hand on Pea’s back. Stephen enters and looks at Roe. Roe says, “He’s drowning. He hurts too much.” Reception Two well- known articles on Drowning are by Michael Feingold and John Simon. According to Feingold’s article “Entertainment Centering,”https://www.villagevoice.com/1999/10/05/entertainment-centering/ Drowning’s ending was an achievement because of the cohesive work between both the author and director. His review, however, is refuted according to John Simon’s “Upside Down” where he expresses his distaste for the short play by calling it “Totally nonsensical and certifiably affectless.” ctda.library.miami.edu/fest/occurrence/639 David Sheward, an author for the website Cultural Weekly, shares the same perspective as Simon when he comments about actor Mikeah Ernest Jennings’ role as Pea, saying, “It doesn’t help that there is a dull nine-minute pause to change scenery between the Albee and Fornes pieces filled with only an actor (Nicholas Bruder) listening to a radio.”culturalweekly.com/indecent-signature-plays-show-power-avant-garde/ Peter Marks, in his New York Times Theatre review, describes Pea and Roe as “at once eerie and gorgeous, the gelatinous mounds of flesh that feel the pain of rejection so deeply…” He goes on to describe them as “tuskless walruses that have evolved into bipeds.” In Pete Hempstead’s review on Theatremania.com, Hempstead talks of Pea and Roa, “two humanoid characters,” and the issue of body politics. Drowning, according to Hempstead, while offering only occasional moments of laughter, “swims in comparatively calm waters.” He goes on to reflect on how we as viewers might relate to the characters: “At first we feel that these oddly shaped beings, with their lethargic conversation and sloth-like movements, don't have much in common with us — until we see a tear in Pea's eye.” Political Significance In the journal article, Subversive Acts: Gender, Representation, and race in contemporary feminist theatre, Raima Evan of the University of Pennsylvania explores popular and little-known plays as they relate to contemporary feminism, and how the writers of these plays “invoke the invisible in order to disrupt a dominant discourse invested in aligning women and ‘minorities’ with the visible, silent, abject body.” Fornés is among the writers, and specifically, her play, Drowning. In the plays discussed, the characters are non-binary, and their body compositions are often “the site of mulitple—and contradictory—meanings.” Pea and Roe, then, as giant mounds of flesh, are ideal representations of these types of characters, and Fornés successfully provides a play that contributes to a non-binary, non-exclusive ideal. Ultimately, Evan concludes that Fornés’ work along with the other writers are important for “inventing a new theatre vocabulary which expresses hitherto marginalized subjectivities, sexualities, and identities.” Peter Marks, in his review, corroborates the marginalized and abject that is represented and yet subverted in Drowning. “His innocence stripped away,” says Marks, referring to Pea, \\"he gets his first, corrosive lesson in how to see himself through others' eyes, a lesson in how to detest himself.”  References  Category:Plays by María Irene Fornés Category:1987 plays Category:Plays based on works by Anton Chekhov ","title":"Drowning (play)"},{"id":"62564468","text":"Luo Qingming (; born January 1966) is a Chinese scientist currently serving as president of Hainan University since September 2018.

The move sparked a widespread national and overseas ongoing protests against the act and its associated proposals of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The protests first began in Assam and spread swiftly in other states such as Delhi, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tripura on 4 December 2019. Protests broke out rapidly across the country, although the concerns of the protesters vary., Quote: \\"Though the protesters in India share a common opposition to the new citizenship law, their reasons for rejecting the legislation vary.\\" The CAA amends the Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, and Christian from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and who entered India before 2014 following the religious persecutions.Citizenship Amendment Bill: India's new 'anti-Muslim' law explained, BBC News, 11 December 2019. The bill does not mention Muslims and other communities who fled from the same or other neighbouring countries. Refugees from Sri Lankan Tamils in India, Rohingyas from Myanmar, and Tibetan refugees are not mentioned in the bill. The proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be an official record of all legal citizens of India. Individuals would need to provide a prescribed set of documents before a specified cutoff date to be included in it. The amendment has been widely criticised as discriminating on the basis of religion, particularity for excluding Muslims. Protestors against the amendment demand that it be scrapped and that the nationwide NRC not be implemented. The bill has raised concerns among the Indian Muslim as well as poor Indians as they might be rendered stateless that could lead them to detention. They are also concerned that all citizens will be affected by the bureaucratic exercise of the NRC where they will have to prove their citizenship for inclusion in the registry. The protesters have raised voices against authoritarianism and the police crackdown in universities to suppress protests. Protesters in Assam and other northeastern states do not want Indian citizenship to be granted to any refugee or immigrant, regardless of their religion, as they fear it would alter the region's demographic balance, resulting in a loss of their political rights, culture, and land. They are also concerned that it will motivate further migration from Bangladesh that could violate the Assam Accord which was a prior agreement reached with the central government on migrants and refugees. The protests started in Assam on 4 December 2019, after the bill was introduced in parliament. Later on, protests erupted in Northeast India, and subsequently spread to the major cities of India. On 15 December, major protests took place near Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi and Aligarh Muslim University. As the protests broke out, mobs burnt and destroyed public as well as private properties and several railway stations were vandalised. Police forcibly entered the campus of Jamia, used batons and tear gas on the students, and more than 200 students were injured while around 100 were detained overnight in the police station. The police action was widely criticized and resulted students across the country protesting in solidarity. The protests resulted in thousands of arrests and 27 deaths as of 27 December 2019. Two 17-year-old minors were among those reported to have been killed due to police firing during a live ammunition on protesters in Assam. On 19 December, the police issued a complete ban on protests in several parts of India. As a result of defying the ban, thousands of protesters were detained.  Background  A child taking part in an anti- CAB NRC protest with Jamia Millia Islamia students and locals. Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 (CAB) was introduced by the Home Minister, Amit Shah on the floor of the Parliament of India on 9 December 2019 in response to the exclusion of 1.9 million people, predominantly Hindus and Muslims in the National Register of Citizens for Assam. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December. It amends the Citizenship Act of 1955 to grant a swifter path to Indian citizenship under the assumption of religious persecution to any individual belonging to the specific minorities of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act also seeks to relax the requirement of residence in India for citizenship by naturalization from 11 years to 5 years for migrants covered under the Act. However, the Act does not mention Muslims and does not offer the same eligibility benefits to Muslim immigrants or immigrants belonging to other religions from those countries. The Act also does not mention any benefits for various other refugees which form the bulk of the refugees living in India, such as Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who faced persecution during the Sri Lankan Civil War, Rohingya refugees who were victims of the Rohingya genocide, Nepali refugees who faced ethnic cleansing in Bhutan, and Tibetan Buddhist refugees who faced persecution in China. According to the Intelligence Bureau, the immediate beneficiaries of the new law will be 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis. Response The passage of the Act sparked massive protests in India. Protesters in Assam and other northeastern states oppose the grant of Indian citizenship to any refugee or immigrant, regardless of their religion, because they fear it would alter the region's demographic balance. They have campaigned since the 1970s against all refugees, and they fear that the new law will cause a loss of their political rights, culture and land. They are also concerned that it will trigger more migration from Bangladesh as well as violate the Assam Accord, which was a prior agreement reached with the central government on migrants and refugees. After the act was passed, protests in the northeastern region turned violent. Authorities had arrested over 3000 protesters as of 17 December 2019, and some news outlets have described these protests as riots. Protesters say that the Act violates Clause 5 and Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord. Critics have stated that the amendment Act is unconstitutional. The major opposition political parties state that it violates Constitution's Article 14, one that guarantees equality to all. They allege that the new law seeks to make Muslims second-class citizens of India, while preferentially treating non-Muslims in India. Critics of the Act have also stated that due to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Muslims could be made stateless, while the Citizenship Amendment Act would be able to shield people with Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian identity as a means of providing them with Indian citizenship even if they fail to prove that they were citizens of India under the stringent requirements of the NRC. Some critics allege that it is a deliberate attempt at disenfranchising and segregating Muslims in line with the ethnonationalist Hindutva ideology of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Tavleen Singh described the Act as India's first Nuremberg Law. The home minister Amit Shah had previously set a deadline for the implementation of a countrywide NRC by stating that the register would be rolled out before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Act was criticized by various NGOs, students bodies, and liberal, progressive, and socialist organizations across the country, with the Indian National Congress and other major political parties announcing their staunch opposition. Protests led by these groups are concerned that the new law discriminates against Muslims, and believe that Indian citizenship should also be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants. The states of Rajasthan, West Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh – all ruled by political parties that oppose the BJP – have announced that they will not implement either the National Register of Citizens (NRC) or the Citizenship Amendment Act. The states of Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have however refused to only implement the NRC, while the state of Punjab and the union territories of Delhi and Puducherry have refused to implement the Act while only expressing disapproval of the NRC. The states of West Bengal and Kerala have also put a hold on all activities relating to the preparation and update of the National Population Register which is necessary for the Census as well as the implementation of the National Register of Citizens. Although some of the states have opposed the Act, the Union Home Ministry clarified that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that \\"The new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it.\\" The Indian Union Muslim League and various other bodies have also petitioned the Supreme Court of India to strike down the Act as illegal and unconstitutional. Underlying causes According to Yashwant Sinha, a former administrator, Minister of Finance and Minister of External Affairs under Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and Atal Bihari Vajpayee respectively, the unrest witnessed is also caused due to the economic crisis facing the country where the issue of CAA-NRC has acted as a trigger for it. The Indian economy has been witnessing a decreasing growth rate, increasing household debt, inflation, unemployment and economic inequality. Raghuram Rajan, an Indian economist and 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, attributed it to an \\"extreme centralization of power\\" under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The State Bank of India estimates a growth rate of 4.6% for the Financial Year 2020, which would be the lowest since the 2008 Global Recession where the growth rate had been 3.9%. The unemployment rate of India was reported to have reached a 45 year high of 6.1% in the financial year of 2017-2018. The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy stated the unemployment rate to be 8.45% with a rate of 37.48% for the 20-24 age group and 12.81% for the 25-29 age group in October 2019. According to the 2019 report of the Pew Research Center, 393.7 million jobs are in a vulnerable state. The Oxfam India data states that the richest 1% of the population's control over the country's wealth increased from 58% to 73% between 2018-2019, while the wealth of the poorest 50% increased by 1%. According to Nisha Agarwal, CEO of Oxfam India, \\"the billionaire boom is not the sign of a thriving economy but the symptom of a failing economic system\\". Protesters have agitated against the economic distress and expressed support for labour unions opposing the government's \\"anti-labour policies\\" Farmers and labour unions have been agitating against the economic policies of the government have also demanded for the withdrawal of the CAA and the associated NRC-NPR process. Various opposition parties supporting the protests have announced that they will bring up economic crisis as an issue of protest alongside CAA and NRC. Several opposition and protesting leaders have stated that the issue of CAA and NRC were brought about to divert the political discourse away from the economic condition of the country.

The members have asked EU to include a \\"strong human rights clause with an effective implementation and suspension mechanism\\" while negotiating any trade agreement with India.

Slogans and poems Protesters used several slogans and poems during the protests. Lyricist and Urdu poet Rahat Indori's famous ghazal \\"Sabhi ka khoon hai shaamil yahan ki mitti mein; kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai\\" (This land has seen sacrifices from everyone; Hindustan is not anyone's property) resonates throughout the protest. Revolutionary poems by Pash like \\"Main Ghas Hoon; Main aapke Kiye Dhare Par Ugh Ayunga\\" (I am grass, I will rise everywhere), lyricist and writer Varun Grover's poem like \\"Tanashah aakar jayenge, hum kagaz nahi dikhayenge\\" (Dictators will come and go but we will not show our documents), \\"Main Inkaar Karta Hoon\\" (I refuse) penned by singer Aamir Aziz and the popular poem \\"Main Hindustani Musalmaan Hoon\\" (I am an Indian Muslim) by Indian spoken word poet Hussain Haidry has been used during the protests. Along with poems, the famous revolutionary \\"Aazadi!\\" slogan by JNU students has been used extensively throughout the protest in all over the country and abroad. Slogans, poems and songs used during Indian independence movement like \\"Inquilab Zindabad\\" (Long live the revolution) coined by Indian freedom fighter Hasrat Mohani, \\"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna aab haamare dill mein hai; Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qatil mein hai\\" (The desire for revolution is in our hearts; Let's see how much strength the enemy has) written by Bismil Azimabadi which were later popularised by martyr Bhagat Singh, Ashfaqullah Khan, Chandrashekhar Azad and Ram Prasad Bismil were used as main vocal resistance during the protest. Protesters used the poetry written by revolutionary poets such as Faiz Ahmad Faiz and Habib Jalib, both considered symbols of resistance against military dictatorships and state oppression in Pakistan. Poems such as \\"Hum Dekhenge\\" (We will witness) penned by Faiz and \\"Main nahin janta, main nahin manta\\" (I refuse to acknowledge, I refuse to accept) penned by Jalib inspired large scale protests in form of banners and recitations. \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha Hindustan Haamara\\" (Better than the entire world, is our Hindustan) by Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal was recited in the protests. Singer and lyricist Aamir Aziz wrote Main Inkaar Karta Hoon as a Hindustani protest poem. Aziz's work was political poetry which was used during the protests and also to protest against the police brutality on the student protesters who were demonstrating against the Act. Along with Hindi and Urdu literature, English poems and slogans were also used for the protests. Among those one such dramatic monologue by a teacher named Ajmal Khan, \\"Write me down!, I am an Indian; This is my land, If I have born here, I will die here; There for, Write it down! Clearly In bold and capital letters, On the top of your NRC, that I am an Indian!\\", improvised from Mahmoud Darwish's song Write Down!, questions the Act's secularism and the Government. The poem strongly urged not to question the identity and patroitism of the Indian Muslims, the tribals, the poor, the landless, the Dalits and questioned the various actions of right wing organisations in the country. Pink Floyd co-founder and musician Roger Waters recites \\"Everything will be remembered, Everything recorded\\", an English Transliteration of Aamir Aziz’s poem \\"Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega\\" at a protest in London.

This novel protest was then officially supported by the opposition DMK party. Following the kolam protests in Tamil Nadu, anti-CAA protestors in West Bengal also started drawing kolams, known as alpana or rangoli in Bengal. Government The government used various methods to stop the protests, including mass shooting by riot police, stone pelting, vandalism, lathi charge, mass arrest, Internet shutdown, curfew, transport restrictions, water cannon, and imposing ban on assembly (Section 144).  Participants  The law was considered controversial since the time it was proposed, leading to protests from students, political organisations and citizen groups.

International *: Secretary- General of the United Nations, António Guterres condemned the \\"violence and alleged use of excessive force by security forces\\" and urged the Government of India to respect the freedom of expression and opinion and freedom of peaceful assembly. *: People's Daily, an official newspaper of Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, justified internet restrictions citing India's internet shutdowns. The newspaper said that India did not hesitate to shut down the internet in its two states when there was a significant threat to its national security; according to an article in The Times of India, activists described the justification as setting a dangerous precedent for internet freedom. *: The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan criticised the CAA by claiming that \\"the present Government. of India has been exposed of its fascist agenda as minorities have come out to protest against the CAA\\". He also expressed his concern that, such policies by the government. may create a major refugee crisis in the sub-continent. *: Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said \\"Already people are dying because of this law, so why is there a necessity to do this thing?\\". In response, the Government of India summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Malaysian Embassy over the matter. *: US Congress think tank Congressional Research Service expressed concerns that the CAA along with the NRC may affect the status of the Indian Muslim community. *: In a statement issued during National Assembly session in Kuwait group of lawmakers expressed their concern regarding \\"abusive legislative and repressive security measures\\" taken by the Government of India. *: OIC expressed their concern about present situation of CAA-NRC and urged the Government of India to ensure the safety of the Muslim minority and to follow obligation of Charter of the United Nations. *: In an interview to Gulf News Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, \\"Within India, people are facing many problems” and expressed her concerns saying, \\"We don’t understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary\\". Though she maintained her stance that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India. But Hasina’s government had previously said that minority communities did not leave Bangladesh because of persecution. She also said that Prime Minister Modi assured her of no reverse migration from India. *: Former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai urged Government of India to treat all minorities equally. In an interview to The Hindu, he said, \\"We don’t have persecuted minorities in Afghanistan.\\" Mentioning about the Afghanistan conflict, he said, \\"The whole country is persecuted. We have been in war and conflict for a long time. All religions in Afghanistan, Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs, which are our three main religions, have suffered.\\" * Seattle: The Seattle City Council passed a resolution against the CAA, becoming the first foreign legislative body to do so. The resolution was introduced by Indian American City Council member Kshama Sawant. *: EU resolution states that CAA marks 'a dangerous shift ' in the way citizenship will be determined in India and is set to create the 'largest statelessness crisis in the world'.  Human rights organisations  *United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR): Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had said that it is ‘concerned’ that the CAA is ‘fundamentally discriminatory in nature’. In a press briefing OHCHR said that CAA appears to \\"undermine the commitment to equality before the law enshrined in India's constitution and India's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\\", which prohibit discrimination based on racial, ethnic or religious grounds. It also said that \\"all migrants, regardless of their migration status, are entitled to respect, protection and fulfilment of their human rights.\\" *Human Rights Watch (HRW): South Asia Director for HRW, Meenakshi Ganguly said that the \\"government failed to grasp the extent of public opposition over the erosion of basic rights evident in these protests\\". She urged that the government must establish an independent investigation into allegations of \\"excessive force, brutality, and vandalism\\" by police. Its \\"strongest response to the protests would be to repeal\\" the Act and \\"withdraw its plan for citizenship verification that threatens marginalized communities\\", the organisation said. According to an 82-page report published on 9 April 2020, by Human Rights Watch, “‘Shoot the Traitors’: Discrimination Against Muslims Under India’s New Citizenship Policy,” the police forces and other law enforcement officials perpetually failed in intervening during clashes between the supporters of the BJP government and those protesting against the new citizenship policies, in which the latter became a victim of repeated attacks. *Amnesty International: Avinash Kumar, Executive Director of Amnesty India said \\"The CAA is a bigoted law that legitimises discrimination on the basis of religion.\\" He also said that people should have the right to protest peacefully and should have right to freedom of peaceful assembly which facilitate freedom of expression and allows public debate. However, the Central Government and other state governments \\"rather than respecting, protecting and promoting this right, are clamping down on protestors by using repressive laws\\". Amnesty has also informed the US lawmakers that the CAA stands in \\"clear violation\\" of the constitution of India and international human rights law and \\"legitimises discrimination\\" on the basis of religion.  Pro-CAA demonstrations  Rallies and demonstrations in support of Citizenship Amendment Bill were held in New Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur, Bangalore, Dehradun and some other places. A rally in Kolkata was headed by Jagat Prakash Nadda, working national president of BJP, and was attended by Hindu refugees from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Protests against CAA were condemned in these rallies and hailed Narendra Modi for taking a decision on CAA. Nine Jain organisations came out in support of CAA on 20 December 2019 and thanked a BJP politician and BJP for the Amendment. Over 1,000 academicians released statements in support of CAA.

The participants also carried a 500-metre-long Indian national flag.  Assam  A rally was organised by BJP to support the Citizenship Amendment Act in Assam's Morigaon on 27 December in which over 50,000 civilians, including BJP workers, Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland People's Front leaders took part. The 4-km long rally was led by Assam Chief Minister of Assam Sarbananda Sonowal and state Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.  West Bengal  Thousands of BJP workers took out a massive rally named Abhinandan Yatra or Thanks-giving rally in North Kolkata in support of CAA on 30 December. It was led by the party's Working President J P Nadda to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for enacting the Citizenship Amendment Act. Road traffic in many parts of central and north Kolkata was paralysed in the afternoon.  Gujarat  On 24 December, a large gathering was organised at Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad. Vijay Rupani, Chief Minister of Gujarat was present at the event, said that Gujarat will definitely implement CAA.

Devendra Fadnavis, former chief minister of Maharashtra, targeted Shiv Sena at the event organised by BJP's Samvidhan Sanman Manch also organised pro-CAA rally in Mumbai.  Fake phone call campaign  Several BJP leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah had publicized a phone number, asking people to call the number as a way to show their support for the CAA. Many pro-BJP accounts on social media pretending to be of lonely and bored women, were seen sharing the same number and asking people to call, intending to inflate the number of supporters of CAA. The number was also shared on bogus posts offering free six-month subscriptions to the streaming site Netflix for free. Netflix called the offer as fake.  Fake videos  A video of Naga Sadhus celebrating at Kumbh Mela at Allahabad in March 2019 was shared and made viral on social media, falsely claiming that this was the video of Hindus in the rally supporting CAA.  Fake news  During the protests, there were various instances when netizens, especially those supporting the BJP or working in the party, had spread various messages and posts on social media, intending to paint the anti-CAA protestors in bad light or influence political opinion. Overseas Members of the Indian-American community held a pro- CAA rally in front of the Indian Consulate in Houston on 20 December 2019. They also held other rallies at Victor Steinbrueck Park, Seattle and Texas State Capitol building in Austin on 22 December 2019. Rallies were also held at Ted Kaltenbach Park, Dublin, Ohio and at Nash Square Park, Raleigh, North Carolina. Petitions in Supreme Court On 14 January, the Kerala government approached Supreme Court to challenge the CAA under section 131 of the constitution that provides Supreme Court the power to decide the disputes between the states and the Government of India. The Kerala government in its petition called the act \\"a violation of India's secular constitution\\" and accused the Indian government of dividing the country among religious lines. The Supreme Court had scheduled the hearing of CAA related petitions on 22 January. The students' association have called a complete shutdown of the colleges and university in the north-east, on 22 January, asking the court to declare CAA unconstitutional. On 22 January 144 CAA related petitions scheduled for hearing in the Supreme Court of India were brought up. The Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde had lead the three judge bench in hearing the petitions. The court gave notice to the government on the petitions and allowed one month time to respond in the next hearing in February. K.V. Vishwanathan, a senior advocate addressed the court, stating \\"The most immediate concern now is the sweeping powers given to executive authorities to brand people as 'doubtful citizens'. Once this is done, there are no guidelines to help these people. This is sinister. It will lead to gerrymandering of electoral rolls. The concern is spread across both the majority Hindus and the minorities as well. You have to address this fear... Otherwise fear and insecurity will pervade the country.\\" Reacting to the concerns the CJI stated that the laws like the CAA are not irreversible, and the court will hear the interim prayer for a stay on CAA at a future date in February. On 3 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), filed an application in the Supreme Court and asked to be made a party in the case citing \\"the exclusions of persons... on the basis of their religion\\". The OHCHR Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet said that the \\"differentiations\\" drawn by the Act are not \\"sufficiently objective and reasonable\\". However, the Ministry of External Affairs reacted to the move and said that the CAA is an \\"internal matter\\" of India and \\"no foreign party had any locus standi on issues pertaining to India's sovereignty\\".

She is a member of the Democratic Party and a registered social worker. She has held the seat since its creation in 1994. Her strongest electoral result was in 2003 when she secured 73.6% (1,625 votes), while in the 2019 elections she held the seat with 51.05% (2,669 votes). Political career Cheng served as Bonnie Ng's campaign manager during the , in which Ng's campaign posters were suspiciously vandalised. In July 2019, Cheng criticised the government's crackdown on 12 June 2019, and asked Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign, retract the government's classification of 12 June protest as a \\"riot\\", and set up an independent commission of inquiry. In August, she released a joint statement along with four other Democratic Party district councillors in the Central and Western District. The statement condemned police officers for releasing tear gas in densely populated residential districts without warning, leading to respiratory health concerns. Cheng was elected chair of the Central and Western District Council for the 2020–23 term during the council's first meeting on 2 January 2020, with fellow Democratic Party councillor Victor Yeung elected as vice-chair. January 2020 meeting controversy and subsequent harassment A Central and Western District Council meeting held on 16 January 2020, discussing issues relating to the police force, was attended by Commissioner of Police Chris Tang with a number of plainclothes police officers on standby at the venue. Cheng requested the plainclothes officers to display their warrant cards; one officer who refused to show his warrant card was evicted from the venue. Cheng subsequently questioned Tang regarding the number of people who had been \\"raped, sent to China, suicided (被自殺)\\"; other pro-democracy district councillors also added questions on law enforcement tactics by police during the 2019 protests. A group of pro- government protesters at the venue, including activist , yelled slogans, and clapped after Tang spoke; many of these protesters were expelled by Cheng. Cheng later said on social media that she received an average of four to five unsolicited calls without caller ID between 16 and 17 January, though the callers did not say anything upon her responding. March 2020 arrest On 26 March 2020, Hong Kong police arrested Cheng under a sedition law. She was alleged to have shared the identity of a police officer who fired a baton round that blinded a journalist during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Members of the Democratic Party, including lawmaker Ted Hui, went to bail Cheng out from jail. When the police requested an unanticipated and unexplained increase in bail money by an additional $5,000 HKD, the party members raised the money in cash immediately outside the police station. Pro-Beijing politician Chan Hok-Fung later uploaded a photo of the scene onto social media, accusing Hui of bribing protesters. The accusation was denied by Sam Yip, a pro-democracy Central and Western District Council member. The Democratic Party later released a statement suggesting that the photo could only have been taken from within the police station, and alleged that the situation was orchestrated by police to slander the party. Later reports suggested that the Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Council. On 19 October 2020, Cheng was sentenced to 28 days imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, for civil contempt of court through the sharing of the policeman's identity in contravention of a court injunction.

Their way of life, and the predominance of cattle breeding contributed culture, traditions, and cuisine of the Bashkirs.  Traditional dishes and products  Boekken Beremes Qazy (homemade horse sausage) Buza,milk products (koumiss, korot) Bashkir dishes are distinguished by a small number of classic spices: only black and red pepper are used. Another feature of Bashkir dishes is the abundance of meat in all hot dishes and snacks. Башкирская кухня Bashkir cuisine The love of Bashkirs for horse sausage «kazy» and horse fat deserves special attention: Bashkirs love to eat horsemeat with thick slices of fat, washed down with sour broth Korot (fermented milk product), neutralizing the effects of such an amount of fat. The semi-nomadic way of life (cattle ranching) led to the formation of a wide range of long- term storage products. The bulk of Bashkir national dishes are boiled, dried and dried horse meat, lamb, dairy products, dried berries, dried cereals, honey. Examples are dishes such as kazy (horse sausage), kaklangan it (jerky), pastille, koumiss, seyale hary may (cherry in ghee), muyyl mayi (bird cherry oil), Korot (dry kashk), eremsek (cottage cheese) and ayran (doogh)— All these dishes are stored for a relatively long time even in the summer heat and it is convenient to take them with you on the go. It is believed that kumis was prepared exactly on the road — a vessel with mare's milk was tied to the saddle and hung out during the day. The traditional Bashkir dish bishbarmak is prepared from boiled meat and salma (a variety of coarsely chopped noodles), abundantly sprinkled with herbs and onions and seasoned with korot. Бишбармак Bishbarmak This is another noticeable feature of Bashkir cuisine: dairy products are often served to dishes —korot or sour cream. Most Bashkir dishes are easy to cook and nutritious. Dishes like ayran, buza (wheat or oatmeal drink), kazy, katlama, kumis, manti, oyre (soup), umas-ashy and many others are considered national dishes of many peoples from Ural mountains to Far East.Kumis Chak-chak  Bashkir honey  Bashkir honey is known for its taste and is a matter of pride for Bashkirs. Not a single tea party is possible without real Bashkir honey, a sandwich with fresh rustic sour cream is one of the examples of Bashkir national cuisine. For Bashkirs, a matter of honor is the possession of real Bashkir honey (Burzyan bee), produced by relatives, beekeepers. Башкирский мёд Bashkir honey beremes with cottage cheese noodles  Kumis  Kumis (Koumiss) is the national healing drink of the Bashkirs . The ability to make delicious koumiss has long been valued and transmitted from generation to generation. For kumis, special breeds of horses are preferred (Bashkir horse). Kumis is consumed fresh, otherwise it quickly becomes acidic and loses its healing qualities. It contains a small amount of alcohol.  Modern Bashkir dishes  Modern Bashkir dishes have preserved all the originality of traditional Bashkir cuisine and complemented it, diversifying the range of products and serving. Despite the abundance and luxury of modern dishes, traditional dishes occupy a special place in the Bashkir cuisine and on the festive table. At the festive Bashkir table will definitely be bishbarmak, kazy, Hurpa (soup-bouillon), bukken, or chak-chak.  Bashkir tea party  The Bashkirs have a popular expression — «drink tea.» Behind this expression lies an invitation to the Bashkir tea party with pies, yuyasa, boiled meat, sausage, cheesecake, sour cream, jam, honey and all that the hostess has at her disposal. «Drinking tea» at the Bashkirs means «a little snack» — it is obvious that such «tea» is able to replace breakfast or lunch by its fullness. Bashkirs always drink tea with milk: guests are not even asked if they should add milk to tea. The tradition of adding milk to tea is so old that in some regions the issue of when to add milk to a cup is a subject of debate: before pouring tea or after.  Festive table  On holidays, the Bashkirs prepare special dishes: Bishbarmak, Chak-Chak, Belish, Gubadia and others. Chuck-chak is a must-have for any festive table. At the festive feast, it is customary for each guest to offer ulush - the proportion of game (ram, goose, etc.) The Bashkirs have many festive dishes prepared on special occasions: keyeu-bilmene (Pelmeni) - special small dumplings that are prepared for the wedding in honor of the groom, keelen-tukmasy (noodle) - special noodles that the bride prepares to show her ability: such noodles should be especially thin and crumbly. Kystyby The chak-chak, prepared by the bride, is an obligatory part of the wedding ritual — with the washed hands the bride puts a piece of chak-chak into the mouth of all guests after the wedding. Kaz-oemahe is a special occasion for a festive feast when the hostess invites neighbors to help with geese ; in the evening, at the end of work, the hostess treats everyone with fresh goose.  Food bans  The prevailing food bans were associated with religious traditions. Prohibited foods included pig meat, carnivorous animals and poultry (falcon, kite or hoopoe meat), snake and frog meat. Also, it was impossible to eat the meat of swans and cranes (Bashkir totems). It was impossible to eat: thyroid glands, spinal cord, spleen. From fish — it is undesirable to eat fish of those species that do not have scales. Goose Intermitter  Table etiquette  The traditional rules of the table etiquette of the Bashkirs include the following: * Serve food immediately upon arrival * There should be an odd number of flapjack on the table, but no less than the number of guests. * The host touches the food first. * The oldest guest is served first. * The host ceases to eat as soon as the guest ceases to eat. * If there is not enough food, and the guest is hungry, then the host should eat as little as possible to maximize saturation of the guest * Take food and drink only with your right hand. * Do not cut freshly baked bread with a knife, do not bite off a whole tortilla. * You should take worse food out of a common dish, leaving the best to others. * During the meal, keep peace with the owner and seem cheerful and cheerful. * At the end of the meal, pray for the well-being of the host.

The settlement only consists of half-a-dozen houses, but up until the early 19th century, it was a much larger village. However, most of that village, which was on the headland, slipped into the sea as a result of instability caused by quarrying for the alum industry. Kettleness became a smaller settlement, and was relocated slightly further inland. Historically, the hamlet has had an alum works, a jet mining industry and ironstone workings. The hamlet used to have a railway station on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway, that was open between 1883 and 1958. Kettleness is recorded within the parish of Lythe for census purposes. History Kettleness is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, but the neighbouring settlement of Goldsborough is, and both were in the Wapentake of Langbaurgh. The hamlet takes its name from the nearby headland Kettle Ness, but the hamlet is stylised as Kettleness on mapping. The name is thought to derive from Old Norse, where the Kettle part comes from the word Kettil which describes a pot or cauldron. In this sense, the cauldron refers to the cauldron of water around the headland. The Ness derives from the Viking word for headland. Kettle Ness is at the eastern end of Runswick Bay, and the cliffs rise to over above sea level. The present hamlet was built in the 1830s after the collapse of the former village into the sea in 1829. The hamlet is north of the A174 road, north east of Whitby and south east of Guisborough. A chapel-of-ease to the Church of St Oswald, Lythe, was built in 1872 for £300. The building was designed in the Early English style and constructed from Aislaby Stone (a local sandstone) with a Welsh slate roof; most buildings have the distinctive red pantile roofs that the area is renowned for. Whilst the hamlet is in the ecclesiastical parish of Lythe, as well as the civil parish of Lythe, the chapel has since been converted into a recording studio. The hamlet used to have a railway station opened in 1883, on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway between and Whitby West Cliff railway station. This served the nearby village of Goldsborough too, and in 1911, the North Eastern Railway estimated the local population to be 54 people. Both the station and railway line were closed in May 1958 due to the high costs of maintenance on the tunnels and bridges. The station building is now used by scouting and outward bounds groups. During the First World War, a field to the east of the hamlet was used by the Royal Naval Air Service as a refuelling point for aircraft transiting up the east coast. As the location was directly on the coast, it was also used as a base for inshore reconnaissance patrols, though there is no evidence of any squadrons being based there. After the war, the site was used as a coastguard station. Geology and industry Kettle Ness with a glimpse of the disused quarries. As at other locations on the Cleveland coast, the underlying geology has an abundance of mineral resources. The Upper Lias consists of alum shales, jet rock, cement shales, and ironstone. The headland was previously the site of the original village and the alum works, which started quarrying . The site of the alum works and the associated buildings are now designated as a scheduled monument, and were among the last on this stretch of the coast to stop working, with closure coming in 1861. At its peak, between 1805 and 1817, the workings were outputting of alum per year. As it took of shale to make of alum, the headland was quarried extensively, and the workings caused the original settlement to collapse into the sea on 17 December 1829. The villagers had enough time to evacuate as the landslide was quite slow moving, and they sought refuge on a ship (The Henry), anchored in the bay that had come to load up with alum. The slump revealed a new area of shale which could be used to make alum, so a new set of works was built the following year, and the houses of the workers built further inland. Besides alum and ironstone mining, the cliffs have supported a small jet industry, which still entices people to look for the stone along the headland. The ironstone at Kettleness was worked in two sites; between 1838 and 1857, stone was won directly from the cliffs and beach being loaded onto ships directly in the bay, though this was described as a \\"hazardous operation\\". Ironstone was shipped to the Wylam furnaces of Losh, Wilson and Bell. The other mine was located west of the hamlet and operated between 1910 and 1915, with the ironstone being forwarded to Skinningrove Ironworks by rail. The geology and abundance of fossils have attracted many to this area. One of the most notable finds was the skeleton of a plesiosaur in 1883. Legends and culture Kettleness is on a trail established between Whitby and the hamlet with tales of the supernatural, some imagined and some claimed as real, such as a black dog (known as a barghest), which supposedly influenced Bram Stoker to put a black dog in his novel, Dracula. Also in the book, Mina watches the sunset over the headland of Kettleness from the town of Whitby. In the 1950s, a vicar supposedly met the barghest that haunted the area around Kettleness, and used holy water to banish the spirit. The trail was launched in 2015 and covers several waypoints along the way into Whitby, following the route of the Cleveland Way.

It has smooth, greyish bark, glossy green, egg-shaped to spatula-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in clusters of between thirteen and nineteen, yellowish green flowers and fruit with their bases fused together. Description Eucalyptus retusa is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale grey bark that is cream-coloured when new. Young plants have egg-shaped to more or less round leaves that are dull green, paler on the lower surface, up to long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, egg-shaped to spatula-shaped, long and wide, tapering to the petiole. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in clusters of between thirteen and nineteen, the buds joined at the base. The operculum is long and wide at the base. The flowers are yellowish green and the fruit are conical, wide and fused at the base, the fused fruit in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus retusa was first formally described in 2008 by Dean Nicolle, Malcolm French and Nathan McQuoid from a specimen collected near Bremer Bay in 2004. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (retusa) is from the Latin retusus meaning blunted, rounded, notched at the tip. Distribution and habitat The Point Hood yate is only known from a single population at the type location near Bremer Bay where it grows in low scrubland on a rocky headland. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

The club is currently competing in the 2019–20 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, following a successful regional campaign which saw them win the Division One of the Port Moresby Soccer Association in late 2019.  History  According to the club's Facebook page, the side was founded sometime in 2013. However, competitive records of the club begin in 2017, when the club was in Division One of the Port Moresby Soccer Association – the second level of football in the country's capital. The side finished 6th in Division One that year, before being demoted to Division Two for unknown reasons. In 2018, however, they secured promotion back to Division One, finishing second behind Gurupweu. An excellent 2019 season saw the club win Division One and earn promotion to the PMSA Premier Division for the 2020 season. The club won 14 games and lost just three en route to the title, conceding nine goals. In November 2019, it was confirmed that the side were one of 12 clubs in contention for a spot in the upcoming 2019–20 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League. On 11 December 2019, it was confirmed that the side would be one of two debutants in the new season.

A great patron of the arts and music offered him the means to prepare himself thoroughly for the stage. He owes his education to actor Schütte-Harmsen,Shütte-Harmsen on IMDb vocal master Jacobs and his wife Luise Reuss-Belce (Berlin). He found his first engagement in Freiburg in 1896, where he made his debut as \\"Lyonel\\" and stayed for two years. In 1898 he joined the association of the Stadttheater in Zurich, and came from there on recommendation of Ludwig Barnay to the Hamburg State Opera (1899). On March 13, 1900 Jörn stood in for the court opera singer Adolf Philipp at the last hour. In 1902 he was firmly engaged, afterwards he went from 1902 to 1908 to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. He was the favorite singer of Emperor Wilhelms II., who made him gifts several times. From 1905 to 1908 he was a regular guest at the London Royal Opera, he also appeared as a guest in Brussels and Amsterdam. In 1908 he went to the USA to the Metropolitan Opera New York, where he worked until 1914. In 1914 he created Parsifal at the Deutsches Opernhaus Berlin. Although they wanted to keep him in Berlin and even Emperor Wilhelm II supported his whereabouts, he went back to the USA. In 1916 he became a US citizen and ended his singing career. He lost his fortune through speculation with dubious inventions in the 1920s. He then lived as a singing teacher in Denver. When Johanna Gadski toured the USA with the German Opera Company from 1929 to 1931, she invited him to participate. In 1932 he opened a singing studio in New York, but later went back to Denver where he died at the age of 84.

Denis Le Bihan has received international recognition for his outstanding work, introducing new imaging methods, particularly for the study of the human brain, as evidenced by the many international awards he has received, such as the Gold Medal of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001), the coveted Lounsbery Prize (US National Academy of Sciences and French Academy of sciences 2002), the Louis D. Prize from the Institut de France (with Stanislas Dehaene, 2003) and the prestigious Honda Prize (2012). His work has focused on the introduction, development and application of highly innovative methods, notably diffusion MRI.  Biography  Denis Le Bihan studied medicine and physics in Paris. After an internship in neurosurgery, radiology and nuclear medicine, he obtained his doctorate in medicine in 1984 (University of Paris VI) with the specialty \\"radiology\\". He also follows a course in human biology (functional explorations of the nervous system, mathematical models in medicine). His training in physics focuses on nuclear physics and elementary particles. He obtained his doctorate in physics in 1987, his thesis focusing on a completely new method of magnetic resonance imaging that he introduced and developed (diffusion imaging and IVIM imaging (en) for IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion). In 1987, he joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, where he remained until 1994. This is where he continues to develop diffusion MRI, introducing diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with Peter Basser. Denis Le Bihan joined the Frédéric Joliot Hospital Service of the CEA in 1994 to head the anatomical and functional neuroimaging laboratory. In 2000, he became Director of the Federal Institute for Research in Functional Neuroimaging (IFR 49). He presided over the founding and opening of NeuroSpin in 2007 and has been its director since then. Since 2005, Denis Le Bihan has also been a regular guest professor at Kyoto University (Human Brain Research Center). NeuroSpin has been able to mobilize significant public funding to conduct innovative research in neurodegenerative disease imaging. As part of the Franco-German Iseult NeuroSpin project, CEA teams are in the process of finalizing the construction of a unique MRI scanner using a record magnetic field of 11.7 teslas, thanks to a magnet of more than 100 tons with an original design.Guy Aubert, Petite histoire des grands instruments : de l’astronomie à la recherche..., Publications de l'AUEG, 2007  Scientific Works  Denis Le Bihan is particularly recognized for his pioneering work on diffusion MRI, a concept whose principles he establishedLe Bihan D et Breton E, « Imagerie de diffusion in vivo par résonance magnétique nucléaire » C.R. Acad. Sc. Paris, T.301, Série II:1109-1112, 1985 and demonstrated its potential,Le Bihan D, Breton E, Lallemand D, Grenier P, Cabanis E et Laval- Jeantet M, \\"MR Imaging of Intravoxel Incoherent Motions: Application to Diffusion and Perfusion in Neurologic Disorders\\", Radiology (journal) 1986;161:401-407.Le Bihan D, Breton E, Lallemand D, Aubin ML, Vignaud J et Laval-Jeantet M, \\"Separation of diffusion and perfusion in intravoxel incoherent motion MR imaging\\", Radiology, août 1988;168(2):497-505 particularly in the medical field during the 1980s. Since then, Denis Le Bihan has continued to develop and perfect the method, and has further extended its fields of application. Diffusion MRI is used worldwide to study the anatomy of our brain, its connections and functioning. In medicine, major neurological applications include acute stroke and white matter disorders, including psychiatric disorders.Le Bihan D, \\"Looking into the functional architecture of the brain with diffusion MRI\\", Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003;4:469-480 Diffusion MRI is also of great importance outside the brain for the detection and monitoring of cancers and metastases.Le Bihan D, \\"Intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion MR imaging: a wake-up call\\", Radiology, December 2008;249(3):748-52.  Diffusion MRI and Stroke  Diffusion MRI allows us to detect in the context of the emergency, a few hours after the onset of a stroke, the area of the brain that is dying because it is deprived of blood flow when a blood vessel has been obliterated by a clot. The consequences of stroke are formidable: it is the third leading cause of death, and in 30% of cases it leaves severe functional sequelae (hemiplegia, speech disorders) in patients who become unable to support themselves. Stroke is by far the leading source of disability in the long term, with significant social and economic consequences. Diffusion MRI has led to the urgent and accurate identification of strokeDenis Le Bihan, Le cerveau de cristal : Ce que nous révèle la neuro- imagerie, Odile Jacob, Paris, 2012 and the development of drugs that, injected in the very first hours following stroke, can dissolve the clot and immediately clear up symptoms. The vast majority of MRI scanners manufactured and installed worldwide are equipped with the diffusion MRI method introduced by Denis Le Bihan.  Intracerebral connectivity  The brain contains about 100 billion neurons, our grey matter, which are connected to each other at a rate of 1,000 to 10,000 connections per neuron through extensions called axons that constitute the fibres of the white matter. The diffusion MRI made it possible, for the first time, to produce 3D images of these connections (tractography), in a way that is totally harmless to patients (just lie down for about ¼ hours in the MRI scanner). The principle is based on the fact that the diffusion of water is slower perpendicular to the fibres. It is therefore sufficient to obtain images of the diffusion of water in different directions to account for the orientation of the fibres, which Denis Le Bihan's team first showed in 1991.Douek, P, Turner R, Pekar J, Patronas NJ et Le Bihan D, \\"MR Color Mapping of Myelin Fiber Orientation\\", J. Comput. Assist. Tomogr. 1991;15:923-929 With the diffusion tensor MRI technique (DTI) developed by Denis Le Bihan and Peter Basser at the NIH in 1992Basser PJ, Mattiello J et Le Bihan D, \\"MR Diffusion Tensor Spectroscopy and Imaging\\", Biophys. J. 1994;66:259-267Basser PJ, Mattiello J et Le Bihan D, \\"Estimation of the effective self-diffusion tensor from the NMR spin echo\\", J. Magn. Reson. B., mars 1994, 103(3):247-54. and its variants developed since then (high angular resolution methods), it is now possible to obtain atlases of intracerebral connections with very high accuracy.Le Bihan D, Mangin JF, Poupon C, Clark CA, Pappata S, Molko N, Chabriat H, \\"Diffusion tensor imaging: concepts and applications\\", J. Magn. Reson. \\"Imaging\\", April 2001, 13(4):534-46 Diffusion MRI can therefore not only diagnose and study white matter fibre disorders (such as multiple sclerosis), but also subtle connection abnormalities in neural circuits. These abnormalities that appear very early in life may reflect some functional disorders (dyslexia) or psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, autism). At the other end of life, normal or pathological aging (neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease) is also accompanied by a rearrangement of brain connections that diffusion MRI shows.Le Bihan D, Johansen-Berg H, \\"Diffusion MRI at 25: Exploring brain tissue structure and function\\", NeuroImage 2011.  Diffusion MRI and cancer  Diffusion MRI is becoming increasingly important at the beginning of the 21st century in the exploration of cancers, particularly breast,Iima M, Le Bihan D, Okumura R, Okada T, Fujimoto K, Kanao S, Tanaka S, Fujimoto M, Sakashita H et Togashi K, \\"Apparent diffusion coefficient as an MR imaging biomarker of low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ: a pilot study\\", Radiology, août 2011, 260(2):364-72. prostate and liver cancers. While diffusion MRI is mainly used for the brain, Denis Le Bihan's first trials actually focused on the liver to identify tumours and distinguish them from vascular malformations. The proliferation of cells in cancers and metastases are all obstacles to the diffusion of water, which slows down. Diffusion MRI therefore makes it possible to identify these cancerous lesions and to judge the effect of treatments (such as chemotherapy) well before clinical improvement, which makes it possible to adapt treatment very early in the absence of a positive response.  Non-professional activities  Denis Le Bihan is passionate about music and an experienced amateur pianist who occasionally gives concerts on a voluntary basis. He is also an experienced photographer: he exhibited an extract of his works (photos of Kyoto) in November 2011 at the French Institute of Japan - Kansai in honour of the victims of the Pacific Coast earthquake at Tōhoku He is also at the origin of a weather forecast website (updated daily with a 6-day window, for the moment for the West Paris region) with original forecasting tools that he himself has developed since the age of 12.  International recognition  As a pioneer in his field, Denis Le Bihan has received many awards and recognitions during his career21. * 2014: Louis- Jeantet Prize for Medicine * 2012: Honda Award * 2011: European Congress of Radiology, Opening Lecturer * 2010: Holst Award, University of Eindhoven/Philips Research * 2010: JA Vezina Award, Elected Honorary Member of the Canadian Society of French-speaking Radiology * 2009: Béclère Honorary Lecturer, Medal for the 100th anniversary of the French Society of Radiology * 2009: Fellow of the European Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology * 2004: Elected Honorary Member of the American Society of Neuroradiology * 2003: Louis D.

In France, he is considered to be the first to research the establishing relationships between behavior and neuroscience, as well as creating an integrative neurobiology.  Biography  As a pupil of the Nation (Rocroi Court, 1943), he completed his secondary studies in Givet, the Lycée Henri IV, then at the Lycée de Brest. He was admitted to SPCN at the Faculty of Sciences in Paris (1952), then enrolled in a preparatory class (Brest Maritime Hospital) before being admitted to National School of the Marine Health Service in 1954. At the same time, he continued his medical studies at the Faculty of Medicine. His studies were interrupted for a period of treatment at Sanatorium, Isère. In 1968 he decided to focus on what was still an emerging field, neuropsychiatry. He then specialized in child neuropsychiatry. le Moal also has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Psychology, a Bachelor of Science degree in ChemistryPhysiology. From 1964 onwards, he was an assistant before becoming an assistant professor at the Faculty of Science in Bordeaux. From 1975 to 1976, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the J. Olds' Laboratory in the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). From 1976 to 2005, he was a professor of Neurosciences. From 1980 to 2004, he was the Director of Studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Experimental Psychopathology (EPHE 3rd section). From 1993 to 2003, he was a member of the Institut Universitaire de France. As Professor Emeritus at the University of Bordeaux, he headed several CNRS and Inserm units, designed, and directed the Institut François Magendie de Neurosciences (Inserm - CNRS). Le Moal is considered to be the French pioneer of research aimed at integrating neurobiology by establishing relationships between behaviour and neuroscience. In order to understand the transition from adaptation to disadaptation, he laid the foundations for experimental psychopathology. He has been a member of the French Academy of sciences since 2005. He received the Neuropsychopharmacology Award in 2005.

Research themes and scientific contributions  He attempts to explain the relationship to drugs by integrating an individual's history and education at a cellular level in the brain.. Le Moal resided in the United States since the late 1970s as progress in behavioural neuroscience and psychiatric research was rapid. At Caltech, he how to record animals without movement using multiple intracerebral computer. From 1974 to 1980, his publications focused on: * the role of a ventral neural system including the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin, in motivational processes; stimulation (intracerebral self-stimulation) causes attention arousal, pleasure phenomena, and injury to the system causes the inability to focus and uncontrolled hyperactivity. * the functional roles of dopaminergic systems in their frontal cortical projections; identification of memory syndromes resulting from their local lesions and their specific intracerebral stimulation and blockages; analysis of the neural bases of individual and species survival behaviours; discovery of the central roles of the CRF and vasopressin in adaptive behaviours.(en) Stinus L, Gaffori O, Simon H, Le Moal M., « Disappearance of hoarding and disorganization of eating behavior after ventral mesencephalic tegmentum lesions in rats », J Comp Physiol Psychol. 92(2): 289-296, 1978(en) Gaffori O, Le Moal M., « Disruption of maternal behavior and appearance of cannibalism after ventral mesencephalic tegmentum lesions », Physiol Behav. 23(2): 317-323., 1979 From 1980 to 1995, he based his research on the modalities of the transition from normal to pathological with behavioural analysis and their measurements.(en) Koob GF, Le Moal M, Gaffori O, Manning M, Sawyer WH, Rivier J, Bloom FE., « Arginine vasopressin and a vasopressin antagonist peptide: opposite effects on extinction of active avoidance in rats », Regul Pept. 2(3): 153-163., 1981(en) Le Moal M, Koob GF, Koda LY, Bloom FE, Manning M, Sawyer WH, Rivier J., « Vasopressor receptor antagonist prevents behavioural effects of vasopressin. », Nature. 291(5815): 491-493., 1981(en) Sutton RE, Koob GF, Le Moal M, Rivier J, Vale W., « Corticotropin releasing factor produces behavioural activation in rats », Nature. 297(5864): 331-333., 1982(en) Koob GF, Dantzer R, Bluthé RM, Lebrun C, Bloom FE, Le Moal M., « Central injections of arginine vasopressin prolong extinction of active avoidance », Peptides. 7(2): 213-218., 1986(en) Le Moal M, Bluthé RM, Dantzer R, Bloom FE, Koob GF., « The role of arginine vasopressin and others neuropeptides in brain-body integration. », In: Cognitive Neuro Chemistry.

From 1995 to 2005, in continuity with previous results, Le Moal focused his teams' work on a fundamental question of psychopathology: why some subjects succumb to it while others do not or show resilience and began studying the causes of interindividual, genetic, developmental and environmental differences.

Based on the historical figure of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Dutton weaves an imaginative story about the duchess's extraordinary life.  Synopsis  The book begins with a third person narration of Margaret Lucas's life. It later switches to Margaret's point-of- view. She describes her childhood and how she was very different from her siblings growing up. Margaret later becomes a lady to Queen Henrietta Maria. During her time as a lady, she meets marquess William Cavendish. He begins to court her and they eventually marry; she becomes his second wife. Margaret describes life in exile with her new husband and the numerous doctor visits she endured in their attempt to conceive. She begins to write, publishing her work in secret. Margaret gains fame for her work, drawing the attention of everyone in society. Eventually, she becomes the first woman to be invited into the Royal Society. The book ends with her revising her book, The Blazing World.  Main characters  * Margaret Cavendish – The youngest of eight children. She was Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria. Later, she becomes the second wife of William Cavendish. Margaret never has children, but her published works become her legacy. Before marrying, she was called Mistress Margaret Lucas. After her marriage, she was titled the Marchioness of Newcastle. Later, she is titled the Duchess of Newcastle. * William Cavendish – Husband to Margaret. He was exiled, but eventually is welcomed back to court. Before becoming the Duke of Newcastle, he was titled Marquess of Newcastle.  Reception  Margaret the First was first published in 2016 and has received positive reviews. The New York Times said that \\"the duchess herself would be delighted at her resurrection in Margaret the First . . . Dutton expertly captures the pathos of a woman whose happiness is furrowed with the anxiety of underacknowledgment.\\" A review from The Guardian praises Dutton for \\"us[ing] her staccato structure to illuminate from within individual moments of frustration and inspiration\\" with Margaret's character. Dutton is again praised in another review from BBC.com for her \\"refreshing and idiosyncratic style . . . [she] portrays the inner turmoil and eccentric genius of an intellectual far ahead of her time.\\" References Category:2016 books ","title":"Margaret the First"},{"id":"62565595","text":"Antarctophthirus microchir is a parasite found on pinnipeds (commonly known as sea lions and seals) and is an ectoparasite with the ability to live on the surface of mammals while tolerating submersion in salt water.  Life cycle  Larval stages: Eggs and first larval stage are mainly found on seal pups, which have less contact with water during the beginning of their lives. It is shown that the parasitic eggs have less resistance to water. Nymph: Legs and spine are developed. Adult: Exterior structures are developed. The haustellum functions as a suction and provides stability of the lice on mammal surface. All stages of A. microchir were found on aquatic mammals, suggesting the lice completes the entire life cycle within the host.  Main structures  * Chaetotaxy: Spines, scales, and hairs. Spines typically have grooves. * Spiracles: Serve as a clear membrane for the lice. * Legs: Hinge and middle legs are larger than forelegs. Often used to hold on to hairs of host. * Head: The head is eyeless. However, it possesses a haustellum along with 8 hooks. * Antennae : Consists of 5 segments. The terminal segment has sensorial organs. * Abdomen: Membranous. More rounded in male.

Covering an area of , this beech forest, located in Le Petit Caux in the north-east of the department and the region, has close historical links to the Orléans family. Description A narrow band more than 30 km long and 5 to 6 km wide, the Eu Forest covers the easternmost part of the chalk plateau that separates the Yères and Bresle rivers to the south-east of the town of Eu. This area extends from Saint-Pierre-en-Val, near Eu to the surroundings of Aumale and Mortemer. The Eu forest is made up of several distinct zones. Immediately to the south-east of Eu is the Triage d'Eu (), a slender-looking forest covering a small ridge bordering the Bresle Valley and the slopes of the dry Incheville valley. Further south, the Upper Eu Forest (), is more massive, covering a tabular ridge of about 200m altitude. In the vicinity of Aumale, the Lower Eu Forest () occupies the southern end of the plateau, which is more tabular in appearance. These three massifs are separated by relatively large cultivated spaces, formerly wooded. Nearby isolated woodlands may also be included (adding a further total surface of ): the woods of Tôt, Gomard, Cuverville, Saint-Martin-le-Gaillard along the Yères, and the wood of Guimerville from the Grand-Marché to the south-east of Blangy-sur-Bresle. It is a naturally deciduous forest, but conifers were planted in the \\"voids\\" of the forest from 1900 to 1912, before this policy was extended to other Normandy forests (generally maintaining at least 90% hardwood). The National Forest Fund then further encouraged the re - encroachment of the coppice areas under single forest and coppice of private forests (throughout France ). One of the curiosities of the forest of Eu has long been the ' (or wolves' oak), 27 meters high and planted in the seventeenth century; still living despite having fallen. Natural heritage The Eu forest and the adjacent grasslands are a 'Natura 2000' site. The Upper Eu forest and Yères and Bresle valleys are in a Natural zone of ecological interest, fauna and flora (' or ZNIEFF). The Lower Eu forest is also in a Natural zone of ecological interest, fauna and flora. History and exploitation The history of this forest begins with the abandonment, in the third century, of the Gallo-Roman city, 'Briga', built on the Beaumont plateau at a place called Bois l'Abbé, current excavations showing that this city was not surrounded by forested areas. In 1036, Robert, Count of Eu, granted the monks of the Abbey of Saint-Michel du Tréport the tithe of pannage of the forest of Eu and all the sartage of this same forest. By a charter of August 1282, Jean 1st of Brienne, Count of Eu, undoubtedly at the instigation of his viscounts, limited the monks' pannage in the forest of Eu to eight free-range pigs, while maintaining free pasture for all their animals in the forest. It seems that the forest covered, until the year 1000, the whole plateau separating the valleys of Yères and Bresle; large clearances were then undertaken from the 11th century to the 13th century. It was the time of initial fragmentation of the forest by cultivated fields which still divide the current forest of Eu into three massifs. Land clearing slowed in the 14th century with the start of the Hundred Years' War, the invasions of the troops of the King of England put an end to the prosperity of Normandy. This reduction of clearance continued despite the return to peace due to the development of regular logging. The Counts of Eu, landowners, found it more advantageous to sell the trees to charcoal burners, woodworkers and glassmakers than to cultivate low-paying lands. The exploitation of the forest contributed to the establishment of many glass factories in the surroundings, in particular in the Bresle valley. After belonging to the Dukes of Normandy, then to the Counts of Eu, the forest was confiscated during the French Revolution but it was returned to its former owner in 1814: Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, widow of Philippe Égalité and mother of Louis Philippe I, future king of France. The forest remained a possession of the Orleans family for a long time. In 1852, the forest became nationalised before being returned, once again, to its former owners, in 1872. It was after this restitution that the 28 cast iron posts were installed across the forest, to mark the intersections of the paths. The best known of them is the Pole Maître Jean. At the beginning of the 20th century, the forest passed into the hands of a civil society founded by friends of the Duke of Orleans to avoid state control. Finally, after the failure of an amicable acquisition by the authorities, the expropriation was decided by the law of August 13, 1913, allocating 90% to the state and 10% to the department of Seine-Inférieur (modern Seine-Maritime) on August 15, 1915.

Unsaturated monomers such as acrylates, vinyl chloride, butadiene and styrene require inhibitors for both processing and safe transport and storage. Many monomers are purified industrially by distillation, which can lead to thermally initiated polymerisation. Styrene for example is distilled at temperatures above 100 °C whereupon it undergoes thermal polymerisation at a rate of ~2% per hour. This polymerisation is undesirable, as it can foul the fractionating tower, it is also typically exothermic which can lead to a runaway reaction and potential explosion if left unchecked. Once initiated polymerisation is typically radical in mechanism and as such many polymerisation inhibitors act as radical scavengers. Inhibitors vs Retarders The term 'inhibitor' is often used in a general sense to describe any compound used to prevent unwanted polymerisation, however these compounds are often divided into 'retarders' and 'true inhibitors'. A true inhibitor has a well defined induction period during which no noticeable polymerisation takes place. They are consumed during this period and once gone polymerisation occurs as normal. Retarders display no induction period but provide a permanent decrease in the rate of polymerisation, while themselves being degraded only slowly. Attempts have been made to define the difference quantitatively in terms of reaction rate. In an industrial setting compounds from both classes will usually be used together, with the true inhibitor providing optimal plant performance and the retarder acting as a failsafe. Inhibitors for processing True inhibitors Radical polymerisation of unsaturated monomers is generally propagated by C-radicals. These can be effectively terminated by combining with other radicals to form neutral species and many true inhibitors operate through this mechanism. In the simplest example oxygen can be used as it exists naturally in its triplet state (i.e. it is a diradical). This is referred to as air inhibition and is a diffusion-controlled reaction with rates typically in the order of 107–109 mol−1 s−1, the resulting peroxy radicals (ROO•) are less reactive towards polymerisation. However air stabilisation is not suitable for monomers with which it can form explosive peroxides, such as vinyl chloride. Other stable radicals include TEMPO and TEMPOL, which are exceedingly effective radical scavengers. Certain compounds marketed as true inhibitors, such as p-phenylenediamines, phenothiazine and hydroxylamines like HPHA and DEHA, are also thought to react through the intermediary of aminoxyl radicals. Not all inhibitors are radicals however, with quinones and quinone methides being important examples. Retarders Traditionally, nitrophenol compounds such as dinitro-ortho-cresol and di- nitro-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) have been the most important class of retarders, however they are coming under regulatory pressure due to their high toxicity. p-phenylenediamines, and certain hydroxylamine compounds may also act as retarders. Inhibitors for transport & storage Purified monomers stored at ambient temperatures are of less risk of polymerising and as such the most highly reactive inhibitors are rarely used at this stage. In general compound are chosen which can be easily removed immediately prior to industrial polymerisation to make plastics. Compounds bearing a hydroxy group, which can be removed by an alkali wash, tend to dominate. Examples include 4-tert- butylcatechol (TBC), 4-methoxyphenol (MEHQ), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and hydroquinone (HQ) See also *Anti-skinning agent - These agents prevent polymerisation in paints and varnishes by binding to, and thus inhibiting, the action of oil drying agents References ","title":"Polymerisation inhibitor"},{"id":"62565954","text":"The Walkington Hoard is a hoard of Corieltavian gold staters.

It is loosely based on the killing of Judge John H. Wood Jr. by Jamiel Chagra and his brother that also occurred during the 1980s in El Paso. Drugs, gambling, and trafficking fuel the law office of Santos & Santos, and the elder brothers are quick to incorporate the younger brother after the recent death of their father. The younger brother, Tomas, questions his relationship to his heritage as he sees his brothers so eagerly trying to live the life of the American. When one of the brothers is tried for murder, Tomas leads an elaborate plot to assassinate the presiding judge in the trial. Consumed by his father's memory, Tomas makes an effort to unite with his brothers and instead pulls them apart; in trying to preserve his father's dreams, he destroys them and in the process brings down a first-generation Chicano family's rise in America. When Tomas says, \\"Forgive me my Chicanismo\\", it is a line that reaches out to anyone who has emigrated here, no matter from where or how many generations back. The play explores the Mexican-American struggle to achieve the American dream.  Character list  *Tomas Santos, youngest brother *Miguel Santos, older brother *Fernando Santos (Fernie), older brother *Vicky *Nena *Camacho *Pamela *Judge Benton *Gonzalez *Casper T. Willis *Peggy Tomlinson-Willis *Felicia Lee Tomlinson *Don Miguel, father (voice)  Plot summary  Unfolding over three acts, the play centers on the life of one of three Chicano lawyer brothers initially struggling with maintaining his morals and ethics, and eventually succumbing to the needs of family as well his own desires. The play begins as young Tomas Santos returns to his hometown in El Paso after spending some time working as a San Diego district attorney. He joins his older brothers Miguel and Fernando, who operate a flashy, community-minded private law practice. However, this brief indulgent of Mexican-American swagger is short-lived. Recruited by a federal judge, Tomas becomes an undercover informer tasked with spying on his brothers’ illegal drug trafficking business, foolishly thinking he’ll be able to save the family. Repercussions are as immediate as they are violent, misguided and shocking. As several disasters strike, various loyalties begin to trouble Tomas, making him question his own morals and consequently leading him towards making increasingly destructive decisions. Tomas eventually blows the whistle on his brothers’ corrupt business. He is then faced with the chance of redeeming himself at the cost of committing another horrible act; murdering the presiding judge assigned to his brother’s trial. He questions if the betrayal of kin can be excused on a higher moral ground. Solis makes the audience question whether Tomas has been a victim of the racist U.S. judicial system. Santos & Santos presents such dilemmas as a huge gray area.  Themes and influence  The most prominent theme explored in this play is family. Solis submerges his audience into a story revolving around family and the relationship between brothers with conflicting morals. Using the premise of family as a foundation, Solis also exposes his audience to several other thought-provoking themes. The play explores the theme of second-generation Mexican-Americans struggling in an uphill battle in the land of unequal opportunity, and Solis sometimes spells this out using murky dramaturgical strategies while also masterfully utilizing metaphorical language. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994, roughly a year after the play was first performed. Its influence on Solis is evident throughout several of his works. In “Santos and Santos”, Solis explores this theme of NAFTA being a symbol of increasingly failed opportunity for individuals, echoing the darker side of the false promise of the “American dream” specifically through the Mexican-American perspective.  Awards and production history  At first, Santos and Santos failed to receive any productions even after it was published in the American Theatre magazine, a magazine that likely found its way to the desk of every major artistic director in the country. After much struggle, Solis finally got his play its first unofficial debut in 1993 at the commodious Theater Artaud, otherwise known as The Theatre of Cruelty, as an unfinished work-in-progress. Santos and Santos proved itself to be both impactful and successful as it went on to win two awards shortly after. The same year of its debut, it received The Will Glickman Award for Best New Play in the Bay area. The following year, it also received The Roger L. Stevens award as well as funding from the Kennedy Center’s Fund for New American Plays. Roughly two-years-later in 1995, it had its first official premiere as a fully-realized play at the Dallas Theater Center. It has continued to be produced several times at multiple theaters since its official debut. In 1996 it was performed in Chicago at the Teatro Vista and again the following year at the same theater. In 1997 it was performed in the Maedgen Theatre at Texas Tech University. One of its most notable productions was in July 1996 under the then recently founded San Francisco company Campo Santo. The company produced and performed Santos and Santos at the small New Langton Arts Theater. With the help of an outstanding cast, the play performed just as well in a minuscule space as it did filling the Artaud’s massive, hangar-like theater. The director of this production, Tony Kelly, successfully handled overlapping or quick-changing scenes with grand composure. The set itself consisted of a table, chairs and lighting technician Jim Cave’s bold and effective lighting design. Costume designer Sarah Cant brought Solis’s characters to life perfectly with her spot-on costumes. Solis used the talent of songwriter Tito Larriva to create music which included magnificent excerpts from composer David Conte’s string-based score used in the play’s original debut in 1993. = List of (official) productions = {  !Production/Theater !Year - Theater Artaud 1993 - Thick Description Company December 1993 - The Dallas Theater Center May 1995 - Mixed Blood Theatre Company January 1996 - Teatro Vista May 1996,1997 - Campo Santo/Thick Description July 1996 - University of Washington, Seattle 1997 - Texas Tech University, Lubbock 1997 - California State University, Monterey Bay 2000 - California State University, Sacramento 2002 - University of Texas, El Paso 2003 - Imua Theatre Company, New York, NY July 2000 - Nushank Theatre Collective, Austin, TX December 2000 - El Centro Su Teatro, Denver, CO February, 2004 - San Pedro Playhouse, San Antonio, TX December, 2000 - Teatro Visi´øn, San Jose May 2005 }  Awards  * The Will Glickman Award for Best New Play in the Bay Area, 1993 * The Roger L.

The first women's Twenty20 International match was held in August 2004 between England and New Zealand, six months before the first Twenty20 International match was played between two men's teams. A Twenty20 International can have three possible results: it can be won by one of the two teams, it could be tied, or it could be declared to have \\"no result\\". For a match to finish as a tie, both teams must have scored the same number of runs. The number of wickets lost is not considered. Although such matches are recorded as ties, a tiebreak is played; prior to December 2008, this was a bowl-out, and since then it has been a Super Over. The first tied women's T20I occurred on 18 October 2006, between New Zealand and the Australia, hosted at Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Ausstralia won the resulting bowl-out, and were awarded two points, the equivalent of a win. This was also the only women's T20I match which has been decided by bowl-out. The next tie, involving England and Australia, happened during the group stages of the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20. This was the first instance of Super Over in an women's international. Both Austaralia and England scored 6 runs in their extra over. However, as Australia has hit more sixes (1, compared to England's 0), they have declared winner of the match. On 4 September 2019, a T20I between Nigeria and Rwanda was ended in a tie. However, Nigeria team refused to play super-over and Rwanda was declared winner of the match. there have been 11 tied women's Twenty20 Internationals. West Indies have played in the most, five, and on three of those instances they were facing Pakistan. Only one tie have taken place during ICC Women's World Twenty20 tournaments.

He has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for his work on the TV show, Smash. He has choreographed a number of Broadway and Off-Broadway musicals such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the 2014 revival of On the Town, and the Off-Broadway revival of Rodgers and Hart’s I Married an Angel. Early life Joshua Bergasse was born on March 6, 1973 and grew up in Farmington Woods, Michigan. He attended his mother's dance studio, Annette and Company School of Dance, during his childhood. Around age 15–16, Bergasse started teaching at his mother's studio and his passion ignited. His choreographic inspirations came from the movie musicals he used to watch. His idols included Bob Fosse, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Hermes Pan, and Michael Kidd. He notes that these influences are important to the development of his choreographic style. Career At age 22, Bergasse went to an audition for the national tour of West Side Story during a vacation to New York City to see shows and take classes. He was offered the role of Baby John and was a member of the tour for two years. After the tour ended, he stayed in New York to continue working as a dancer. Bergasse started to choreograph more and more in New York until he became known as a choreographer. In 2012, Bergasse became a choreographer for the TV show, Smash for its two-season run. He got the job offer after the director, Michael Mayer, saw some of Bergasse's work at a New York University benefit and asked for his reel. They originally met during the out of town tryout of Thoroughly Modern Millie. Meyer was the director of the production and Bergasse was a dance captain. They reconnected through Smash. Bergasse was responsible for the choreography of the big dance numbers in the show. This also included any type of dancing in the background of shots. During the filming of the second season, Bergasse was able to choreograph for both of the hypothetical musicals: Bombshell and Hit List. He starts the choreography process for each dance number immediately after the composers finish the song. He will first set the piece on stand-ins for the leads, and then he will teach it to the principals after the executive producers approve the number. The amount of prep time available to get the dance numbers ready ranged from two days to a week. In 2012, Bergasse won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for his work on Smash. In 2014, Bergasse choreographed the Broadway revival of On the Town. He found working on the musical incredibly enjoyable because dance is used as a major form of storytelling in this specific piece. His work on On the Town earned him an Astaire Award and a Tony Award Nomination for Best Choreography. Bergasse has choreographed the Broadway revival of Gigi in 2015 as well as the Off-Broadway productions of Sweet Charity, Bomb-Itty of Errors, Captain Louie, and Cagney. He earned a Drama Desk, an Astaire, and an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination for his choreography in Cagney. His other choreographic credits include West Side Story at the Stratford Festival, Little Me at City Center Encores!, 'It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman' at City Center Encores!, Pirates of Penzance at Barrington Stage Co., Guys and Dolls at Carnegie Hall, and The Sound of Music at Carnegie Hall. Bergasse choreographed the Broadway musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2017. He spent over a year working on ‘Charlie’ before rehearsals began. Once the dancers were in the room, he had six weeks in the studio to set his choreography on them. He encouraged his dancers to contribute to the piece, so it feels like their own as well as his work. Bergasse used different dance styles for different characters. For Veruca Salt, she had a ballet number involved pointe shoes. He choreographed a pas de deux where the partners couldn't touch each other for Charlie's mother and her deceased husband. He even choreographed a dance number for the bed-ridden grandfather. In 2019, Bergasse directed and choreographed a revival of the Rodgers and Hart musical I Married an Angel for the New York City Encores! series. This production starred his wife, Sara Mearns. Bergasse and Mearns were approached to take on this project by Jack Viertel. This is because of the history of George Balanchine choreographing this specific musical with his then significant other, Vera Zorina, as the leading lady. It was thought to be a cute parallel for the pair to revive this musical around eighty years later. The musical contained a significant amount of dancing, including two ten-minute ballet sequences to choreograph. Personal life In November 2012, Joshua Bergasse met Sara Mearns when she was auditioning for a featured dancing role on Smash. The dance number she was being considered for was inevitably cut, but Bergasse and Mearns hit it off and started dating a few months later. After five years of dating, they got engaged on Valentine's Day. They were married on November 3, 2018 in Sunset Beach, North Carolina. Because Mearns is also a dancer, they collaborate on each other's projects. They have also worked on projects together since their marriage such as Rodgers and Hart's I Married an Angel and a dance piece starring Mearns at the Fire Island Dance Festival.

Born Selina Price in Radnorshire around 1780, she was listed as a creditor and beneficiary of London mapmaker and engraver Michael Thomson. In 1821, she married Thomson's business partner Sidney Hall. Hall took over the business from her husband upon his death in 1831. At that time and place it was illegal for married women to own businesses, however, unmarried women (including widows) could own businesses. Maps engraved by Sidney Hall were signed \\"Engraved by Sidy. Hall\\" while Selina marked her maps as \\"Engraved by S.

From 1831 until her death, she operated at 18 Bury Street in the Bloomsbury District of London. Hall died in 1853 around the age of 73. The business was carried on by her nephew Edward Weller.

It was decided to award the winners of the competition a trophy made by Ural Stonecutters.  2003  The first edition of the Yeltsin Cup, which featured 8 national teams, was timed to match the opening of two large arenas in Mid Ural — the Palace of Sporting Games \\"Uralochka\\" in Yekaterinburg, and the sports and health complex Metallurg-Forum in Nizhny Tagil. The first winner of the Yeltsin Cup was the Russian National Team, having won all its matches. Final: Russia vs China 3:1 (25:16, 25:23, 27:29, 26:24) Third place play-off: Azerbaijan vs USA 3:2 (22:25, 28:26, 25:22, 18:25, 15:11).  2004  The 2004 tournament was held in April, instead of June, due to national teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Athens. In the final, the Russian players defeated the Cuban National Team. Final: Russia vs Cuba 3:0 (25:19, 25:21, 25:23) Third place play-off: Azerbaijan vs Dominican Republic 3:2 (23:25, 25:21, 20:25, 25:18, 15:6)  2005  The 2005 tournament was different from the two previous tournaments in that the number of participants was decreased from 8 to 6 and the competition format was changed (single-round tournament with no play-off). Even after the end of the last match, where the Russian National Team, led by new coach Giovanni Caprara, had lost to Team Azerbaijan in five plays, the tournament winner was not immediately clear. Spectators had to wait for the results of the points calculations in all matches played by the Russian and Netherlands National Teams, which at the end of the round had tied with same win-lose ratio (4:1) and even the same plays ratio (14:6). Scoring revealed the Russians to be the eventual winners with 0,026. In the competition for third place, Turkey beat out Azerbaijan, again decided only by a better plays ratio.  2006  As expected, the Russian and Chinese teams met in the final of the fourth Yeltsin Cup tournament. The Chinese team, having nine Olympic champions from Athens 2004 in their roster, celebrated victory in five plays. Boris Yeltsin participated in the awarding ceremony and took photos with tournament winners for the last time.

The Chinese National Team, as with the previous year, demonstrated the most professional volleyball and accepted greetings from Naina Iosifovna. The play of Chen Zhonghe's trainees was not affected by the absence of the notorious Feng Kun. 18-year-old Wei Qiuyue ,Kun's replacement , had a strong tournament and was recognized as the best Cup passer by the organizers. In the final, the Chinese beat Team Netherlands in a close match. The same national teams took the two first places in the Grand Prix tournament at the end of August however, in reverse order, as in the final tournament in Ningbo the Dutch managed to gain revenge over the competition hosts and celebrate overall victory. For the first time in the Yeltsin Cup tournament, the Russian National Team participated as reigning world champion, even though some of their key players were not participating. Also, for the first time, local fans did not see the players of local club among the national team players. Nonetheless, legendary Uralochka trainee Olga Fateeva was among the top 3 players of the tournament (the first being the captain of the Turkish National Team Neslihan Darnel, she was also recognized as the tournament's MVP).

The key favourites, Russia and China, played each other in the opening match, and met 5 days later in the final match. Both times Russia was the victor. The Chinese National Team middle blocker Xue Ming was awarded the Yeltsin Cup MVP prize, Dutch Manon Flier received the \\"Miss tournament\\" award, and the Russian National team passer Yevgeniya Startseva was called the best young player. Final. Russia — China — 3:0 (30:28, 25:16, 25:17). Third place. Netherlands — Italy — 3:0 (25:23, 25:19, 25:23).  2011  The tournament was held in the same format as in the previous year. Yekaterina Gamova and Lyubov Sokolova, as well as both main libero — Ekaterina Kabeshova and Svetlana Kryuchkova were not on the roster of Russia National Team. In the semifinal, where Team Russia lost to the Yeltsin Cup first-timer Brazil National Team with score 2:3, Tatiana Kosheleva and Nataliya Goncharova got injured.

Russia — Poland — 3:2 (22:25, 25:22, 25:22, 22:25, 16:14).  2012  Five teams, that came to Yekaterinburg to the Jubilee X Boris Yeltsin Cup, played in a round robin. Till the final day of the competition Russia and Italy National Teams had chances to hold the first place. Lyubov Sokolova and Tatiana Kosheleva participated in Team Russia after a break, but did not take part in the matches, while Italy National Team included almost the whole team of Worl Cup 2011 winners. Russia National Team scored 3:0 (25:23, 25:18, 25:22) in the match of the two teams and became the cup winner for the seventh time. Individual prizes were as follows: MVP — Yekaterina Gamova, Miss Tournament — Nataliya Obmochaeva, best young player — Yevgeniya Startseva.  2013  In 2013, in the start of a new Olympic cycle and before Kazan Universiade, most of participating teams of Boris Yeltsin Cup significantly renewed their rosters. Carolina Costagrande was the only player of Italy National Team to participate in London Olympics, while among Russia National Team roster such players were Maria Borodakova, Nataliya Goncharova and Svetlana Kryuchkova (the latter did not play due to injury). In the final match between these competitors, Yuri Marichev team won.

Team Russia, unlike its competitors, participated in the tournament lacking its key players — Nataliya Obmochaeva, Tatiana Kosheleva, Iuliia Morozova, Anastasia Shlyakhovaya. Starting with defeat from the Netherlands and having won Dominican Republic in a tie break, Yuri Marichev's charges managed to get to semi-final due to Dutch victory over Dominicans in the final day of the group stage. Both semifinal matches resulted in 3:2 — Russia won Japan, while Bulgaria, that also started the tournament from a defeat, appeared to be stronger than Netherlands National Team. The final match lasted more than two hours, and Bulgarians were losing 1:2, but due to better fitness shape they won the ending of the fourth play. At the beginning of the tie break, when the main opposite of their rivals Natalia Malykh turned ankle and was substituted, Bulgarians gained decisive advantage.

Geothermometry makes up one component of geothermobarometry , which also includes the evaluation of pressure (geobarometry). There are many geothermometers, but garnet-biotite is particularly useful because of the frequent occurrence of biotite and garnet together in medium grade metamorphic rocks. The garnet biotite thermometer correlates temperature with the partitioning of Fe and Mg in coinciding garnet and biotite. The garnet-biotite thermometer has been \\"calibrated\\" many times since the 70's by both experimental and empirical methods, however Ferry and Spear's 1978 experimental calibration study is reported thoroughly and commonly cited. Given a rock containing both garnet and biotite, an equilibrium constant (KD) can be found simply by using microprobe analysis. Then, by comparing the found KD value to the calculated garnet-biotite geothermometer, the peak temperature of rock formation can be determined. Experimental Petrology  Determining the temperature and/or pressure of formation of metamorphic rocks began as a mostly qualitative science. Pelitic index minerals were used to estimate the metamorphic grade of rocks, and the relative conditions of metamorphism across an area. Experimental petrology has allowed researchers to move beyond the qualitative approach and employ quantitative methods. Experimental petrology consists of modeling natural geological systems at different temperatures and pressure in a lab setting. One quantitative method derived from experimentation is geothermobarometry. Geothermobarometry allows for the calculation of equilibrium temperatures and pressures from measured distributions of elements between coexisting phases. Geothermobarometry encompasses both geothermometry (concerning temperature) and geobarometry (concerning pressure). Calibrating the Garnet-Biotite Exchange Geothermometer  Ferry and Spear's calculation of the garnet-biotite geothermometer (1978), involved running experimental reactions between biotite and garnet at a constant pressure (0.207 GPa) and varying temperatures between 500°C and 800°C. The focus of the reactions was on the Fe-Mg exchange: Fe3Al2Si3O12 \\\\+ KMg3AlSi3O10(OH)2 = Mg3Al2Si3O12 \\\\+ KFe3AlSi3O10(OH)2 Ferry and Spear (1978) used a garnet solid solution of almandine and pyrope (All90Prp10) with an iron mole fraction of XFe = 0.9 for all reactions. Varying biotite compositions (from XFe = 0.5 to XFe = 1.0) were selected based on the known bracket of the equilibrium distribution for Mg and Fe that corresponded with the garnet composition. To compensate for the slow nature of garnet equilibration in metamorphic settings, a ratio of 98:2 garnet to biotite was used. Using an excess of garnet forced the biotite do the majority of the work to reach the equilibrium value (KD), expediting the reaction process. Experiments were ran for 13 to 56 days to ensure enough time to reach equilibrium. The resulting data from the experiments (final biotite composition and Fe / Mg concentration) were used to calculate an equilibrium constant (KD) at each reaction temperature. Specific data and figures can be found in Winter (2010) and Ferry and Spear (1978). The relationship between the inverse of temperature (1/K) and the natural log of KD plots as a straight line. Additionally, a linear regression of the data fits the same trend line, indicating a valid geothermometer. Experimental Calculation of Equilibrium Constant: KD = Linear Regression of data: lnKD = -2109 / T + 0.782 Isopleths plotted on a P-T diagram of various KD values are nearly vertical. This indicates that the garnet-biotite reaction is much more susceptible to temperature, and relatively insensitive to pressure (another line of evidence for a good geothermometer) In summary, Ferry and Spear (1978) created a graph that plots KD values versus temperature for the garnet-biotite exchange reaction. KD values of garnet and biotite in rock samples can be easily determined using microprobe analysis. So, given a rock containing garnet and biotite, the temperature of formation can be determined by finding the KD value, and comparing it to the calculated trend line. Limitations Pressure: The Ferry and Spear (1978) calibration was performed at a constant pressure of 0.207 GPa, making varying pressure a limitation for an accurate calculation. However, Spear argues that the garnet-biotite geothermometer is relatively insensitive to pressure changes, and can apply to rocks at any mid- crustal level. This pressure insensitivity is demonstrated by plotting KD isopleths for the garnet-biotite exchange reaction against pressure (y-axis) and temperature (x-axis). The isopleths plot nears vertical, indicating the relative insignificance of pressure. Non-ideal Minerals: Ferry and Spear (1978) used idealized biotite and garnet compositions. As nothing is perfect in nature, Ca can be found in garnet, and Al and Ti can be found in biotite. Consequently, while this geothermometer is useful for rocks found in the greenschist or amphibolite metamorphic facies, it is not as useful for rocks in other facies with higher Ca-garnets and mixed biotites. Several calibrations have been completed that take into account the non-ideal nature of minerals (see below). Applications Geothermometry plays a role in determining the tectonic history of rocks and geologic regions all over the world. Other Calibration Studies The garnet-biotite geothermometer has been calibrated in numerous studies since the 70's. * Thompson (1976) * Goldman and Albee (1977) * Ferry and Spear (1978) * Perchuk and Lavrent'eva (1981) * Hodges and Spear (1982) * Pigage and Greenwood (1982) * Ganguly and Saxena (1984) * Indares and Martignole (1985) * Chipera and Perkins (1988) * Berman (1990) * Perchuk (1991) * Bhattacharya et al.

The award was active from May 2017 to September 2019, when it was cancelled after connections between the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein became public. The physical award was a glass orb, fabricated by an MIT professor. The Disobedience Award was an international award, and individuals and organizations from all disciplines and specialties, including science, medicine, human rights, politics, law, journalism, and technology, were eligible for nomination.  History  The Disobedience Award was created by former director of the MIT Media Lab Joi Ito and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman in July 2016. In July 2017, the Media Lab presented the Disobedience Award to recipients Marc Edwards and Mona Hanna-Attisha to honor their efforts in exposing high levels of lead in the water supply of Flint, Michigan during the Flint Water Crisis. In 2018, the annual award was presented to the founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, and to BethAnn McLaughlin and Sherry Marts; who were recognized for activism in the #MeToo movement and the #MeTooSTEM movement, and for efforts in combating sexual harassment and misconduct in science and in academia. In September 2019, one of the awards' jurors Anand Giridharadas resigned after news came out involving Ito's associations with Jeffrey Epstein. MIT gave orbs similar to the glass orb that was part of the prize to both Epstein and Hoffman.

He was able to attract well-known London actors to take parts in plays that he produced. His actress wife, Fanny Robertson, took over the Lincoln circuit upon his death.  Early life and career  Robertson was the son of James Shaftoe Robertson (died c. 1787), a theatre manager, and Ann Fowler (died 18 April, 1803). From a young age, he and his youngest brother James (1771–1831) took part in theatrical productions; he appeared at York before his fifth birthday. Thomas and James had a middle brother, George Fowler Robertson (1774–1843). On 8 September 1793, Robertson married actress Frances Mary Ross later known as Fanny Robertson. Their nephew was William Shaftoe Robertson, whose children included the playwright T. W. Robertson and the actress Dame Madge Kendal. Following the death of his father, and his mother passing the management to him, Robertson entered into a theatre management partnership with James Edward Miller. An advertisement in the Stamford Mercury on 31 August 1787 stated: The Stamford Mercury, on 11 March 1796, carried an announcement by a Dr E. Laycock and a Mr. William Bousfield Charles Lowe, Junr, of Boston acknowledging that rumours had circulated alleging that Miller had \\"dishonestly acted towards Mr. Robertson\\". The piece witnessed that Robertson declared to Laycock and Lowe that he \\"had no Accusation whatever to make against Mr. Miller, and that such Reports never came from him.\\"}} Nevertheless, The partnership with Miller ended the following week; Robertson bought Miller out and took a new partner, Robert Henry Franklin (1770–1802). Their announcement in the Stamford Mercury of 18 March 1796 read: 19th century Franklin died at the age of 32 in Peterborough on 26 June 1802, leaving his shares in trust for a son; one of his executors was Robertson. Robertson would take any necessary steps to protect his actors as demonstrated by another report in the Stamford Mercury: \\"We are glad to find that the person who threw a glass at Mrs. Robertson from the gallery of the theatre, December last, is made sensible of his offense (see the advertisement in this page) praise is due to Mr. Robertson for the steps which we understand he immediately took to punish this man for his conduct, and we hope they will be an example to the public, to show Mr. Robertson's determination to prevent repetition of offenses, and to preserve uninterrupted the peace of his theatre\\". Robertson was a Freemason and is described as Brother Robertson in handbills and newspaper adverts, which refer to the arrangements for the local lodges and visiting brethren to meet at a local pub or inn before attending the theatre. For example, a Wisbech lodge were to meet at the Spead Eagle before a performance of The Merchant of Venice in May 1813 at Wisbech theatre.Hhandbill, dated 16 May 1813, in the Wisbech & Fenland Museum collection Lincoln opened its New Theatre on 10 September 1806 with an address spoken by Robertson, followed by performances over the next three days. The theatre venues in the Lincoln circuit varied over time, but at some point included theatres in Lincoln, Boston, Grantham, Peterborough, Newark, Oundle, Spalding, Huntingdon, Wisbech, and other nearby towns. Robertson would bring performers well known from London appearances onto the Lincoln circuit. For example, in 1808 he booked the Young Roscius (Master Betty) to appear at Huntingdon, Peterborough and Wisbech shortly before he retired from the stage for the first time. Robertson took his company to the Whittlesey theatre for Whitsun Week in 1811, following their season in Wisbech. While he was in Lincoln Castle Gaol for debt in 1816 supporters aided him and his wife by putting on amateur productions and benefits, purchasing the theatrical travelling property sold by auction on 1 August, and appointing him their manager. In August 1816 amateur performances took place in Wisbech, Grantham and Lincoln to raise funds to re-establish Robertson's company. The performances at Wisbech included Douglas and the farcical musical piece The Farmer and The Poor Gentleman. His brother James brought his theatre company to perform at Lincoln Race Week and to use any profits to help re-establish the theatrical circuit. Some landlords even reduced the rents of their theatres, according to a handbill promoting Speed the Plough and Chip of the Old Block, to be performed in April 1817 at the Wisbech theatre.Handbill in the collection at Wisbech & Fenland Museum Maria Foote appeared at Robertson's Lincoln theatre in November 1828. On her first night she played Olivia in Bold Stroke for a Husband and Variella in The Weathercock. Robertson opened the New Theatre, Whittlesey, on 24 May 1831 with Speed the Plough and the farce The Happiest Day of My Life. The company did not return there for a second season. He died, aged 66, and was buried on 3 September 1831 in Huntingdon. His widow, as Mrs T. Robertson, took over running the Robertson theatre company.

Catchfools () is a fictional location in the Italian novel The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883). Description It is a city where every animal in town has done something exceedingly foolish and now suffers as a result. The leader of Catchfools is a young unseen emperor. Outside of the city is the so-called Field of Miracles (). Pinocchio encounters The Fox and the Cat after leaving Mangiafuoco's theatre with five gold coins. The Fox claims to know Pinocchio's father Geppetto and proposes to Pinocchio to visit the Land of Barn Owls () and thence to a Field of Miracles, where coins can be grown into a money-producing tree. They convince him that if he plants his coins in the field, they will grow into a tree with gold coins. Pinocchio finally reaches Catchfools with the Fox and the Cat. As he travels through the streets of Catchfools, Pinocchio sees that the streets are filled with hairless dogs yawning from hunger, sheared sheep trembling with cold, chickens with no combs and wattles begging for a grain of wheat, large butterflies unable to use their wings because they sold all their lovely colors, tailless peacocks ashamed to show themselves, and bedraggled pheasants scuttling away hurriedly and grieving for their bright feathers of gold and silver lost to them forever. Out of those paupers and beggars, Pinocchio also sees that there are beautiful coaches containing either foxes, thieving magpies, or nasty birds of prey. Upon reaching the Field of Miracles, Pinocchio buries his coins, uses water from the canal to pour over it, and then leaves for the \\"twenty minutes\\" that it will take for his gold to grow. After Pinocchio leaves, the Fox and the Cat dig up the coins and run away. Once Pinocchio returns, he learns of the Fox and the Cat's treachery from a parrot who mocks Pinocchio for falling for their tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse to report the theft of the coins to a gorilla judge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the judge sentences Pinocchio to four months in prison for the crime of \\"foolishness.\\" Pinocchio is taken away by two Mastiff Gendarmerie that the judge summoned and held their hands over Pinocchio's mouth to save time. Fortunately for Pinocchio who spends some time in prison, all criminals are released early by the jailers when the Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies. Upon being released by stating to the jailer that he is a criminal, Pinocchio leaves Catchfools and heads back to The Fairy with Turquoise Hair's house in the forest. Adaptions * Catchfools appears in the 2002 Pinocchio film. Here, it is called Grabadimwit. Pinocchio was told of the Fox and the Cat's trickery by the Talking Cricket. Pinocchio brings up the Fox and the Cat's crimes to a gorilla judge and his fellow judges while listing the Talking Cricket as a witness.

He was a major prominent leader of the Uva rebellion of 1818 after he joined the rebels whom he was sent to suppress by the British. The rebellion was defeated by the British, and Madugalle Disawe along with several other leaders of the rebellion were found guilty.  Before the Rebellion  In the middle of 1816, the Madugalle Nilame and others conspired to oust the English and enthrone a Sinhala king. But a pro-British Nilame took steps to provide information on the conspiracy to the English. He conspired to overthrow the British government and was imprisoned. He was imprisoned in Jaffna Prison from September 1816 to August 1817. He was released in mid-August 1817. The Madugalle Nilame has gone down in history as the first person to be imprisoned after overthrowing the British government. The English have also taken steps to remove him from the post of superintendent and from the post of Gampaha. The freed Madugalle Nilame again fought to drive the British out of Lanka in 1817 and 1818  In to the Uwa Wellassa Great Rebellion  Madugalle Upa Gabada Nilame, an indomitable hero of the 1818 liberation struggle who sacrificed his life for his motherland ..! Madugalle Nilame was one of the main leaders in the freedom struggle of 1817-1818 with the aim of expelling the British from the country and making Sri Lanka an independent state again. The English have stated that the third main leader of the rebellion was the Madugalle Nilame. The Nilame has been loved and respected by many locals for his heroic deeds on the battlefield. The British imposed martial law to suppress the fighting and relentlessly killed the Sinhalese people. They were displaced by breaking down houses and setting them on fire. The canals and streams were broken and the plantations and fields were destroyed to starve to death. The English, as well as their helpers, slaughtered cattle and ate their meat, depriving the villagers of the benefits of cattle. The English rulers generously gave liquor to the officers, the soldiers and those who helped them. Intoxicated, they raped and killed little girls. Women were raped and killed. Girls and women were unfortunate enough to die under the persecution of foreigners in their homeland. In the midst of the repression, the British resorted to various tactics to capture the leaders who led the fighting. Where they could not do the work, they did not hesitate to get others to take the necessary action to accomplish it. The leaders publicly stated that they would give the captors a very high reward. The Governor-General of England, Robert Brownrigg, published a proclamation on March 19, 1818, which contained the names of a group of rebellious leaders and the amount of gifts to be given to their captors. Some may have been greedy enough to capture the leaders of the battle and take bribes from the British. But no one has had the ability or opportunity to capture the leaders. On the morning of September 22, 1818, a group of 70 English men invaded Teldeniya in the Dumbara Province. At that time the power in Teldeniya was under the Madugalle Nilame. Due to the power of the Madugalle Nilame, the people of Teldeniya did not show allegiance to the British. But after about five days, some of the inhabitants gradually began to show allegiance to the English. That allegiance was so great that a Vidanevara who had served the Madugalle Nilame had agreed to hand over the Madugalle Nilame to the English. On the night of September 27, a group of British troops, with the help of Vidanewara, marched with great difficulty to Madugalle Madugalle village in Madugalle Nilame's palace. The group had entered the Madugalle village on the morning of the 28th. The group entered the Vidanevara's house and hid there to trap the Madugalle Nilame that night. The Teldeniya Commanding Officer Captain Dobin was alarmed as he did not receive any information about the troops who went to Madugalle village. Meanwhile, Domin also received information about a gunshot fired from the Madugalle village. Dobin, who thought his troops might be in trouble, immediately sent troops to the village of Madugalle to help. The Madugalle Nilame was informed of the arrival of the troops. Hay immediately fled. Although the Nilame could not be captured, the English troops were able to free two Lanci men captured by the Nilame's forces in March 1818. On September 29, 1818, a group of soldiers under Lieutenant Colonel Hardy marched towards Dumbara. On October 1, Colonel Hardy attempted to capture the Madugalle Nilame. The Nilame chased after him but could not catch him. The Nilame fled towards the ground. Although the Nilame could not be captured, they were able to seize a stock of military equipment to capture those who provided security for the Nilame. No specific location information was available later. But steps have been taken to increase the search for the whereabouts of the leaders. It was October 28, 1818. Lieutenant William O'Neill assaulted and restrained a man with a stone gun and obtained very special information from him. Based on the information received, at around 3.00 pm, a group of about 30 troops deployed surrounded a palace near Paravahagama. Upon entering the palace, O'Neill was able to take control of the Keppetipola Pilimatalawa district. A group including the Madugalle Nilame who were there fled. A group of nineteen persons including the Nilame had fled. Later a group of villagers came to know about the whereabouts of the Nilame. The villagers put the information to the ears of the English. On the morning of November 2, 1818, with the assistance of the villagers of Nigawella, Pubbiliya and Kongahawela, Udugoda Korale, Matale, the Seventy-third Regiment's Ensign Suitbread, with a contingent of troops, captured the Madugalle Nilame at the Matale Kaikawala outpost. The Nilame was caught near Elahera. The English did not forget to thank the villagers who captured the Nilame. Steps were taken to give them an easier tax system. A case was filed in the Kandy Court Martial on the charge of war. The verdict in the case was announced on November 16, 1818, and he was ordered to be beheaded. He was beheaded on November 26, 1818 at the Bogambara Lake in Kandy. The houses and estates belonging to the Nilame were confiscated without killing him. The Nilame's wife and four sons were sent to Kalutara and his mother and sister to Colombo in retaliation from relatives.

The location is identified with either Derbent, Russia or Talis, Iran. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 120-121 The earthquake is recorded in sources from the Byzantine Empire. The chronicler Theophanes the Confessor (8th century) dates the earthquake in the year 6235 of the Byzantine calendar, in the third regnal year of Constantine V (reigned 741-775). This translates to year 743 or 744 of the Anno Domini system. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 120-121 According to Theophanes' narrative, a sign appeared in the north at the time of the earthquake, and dust fell in various places. This narrative is repeated by George Kedrenos (12th century), who used Theophanes as his source. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 120-121 According to a 1982 seismic catalogue by Ambraseys and Melville, this earthquake occurred to the east of Ray, Iran, in the valley of Tang-e Sar-e Darreh. Its recording in Byzantine sources would testify to this being a \\"large magnitude event\\". However the geographic term \\"Caspian Gates\\" was used for a number of mountain passes in the Caucasus. The passes linked the Mediterranean Sea regions to the Iranian Plateau and Central Asia. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 120-121 The term Caspian Gates was familiar to Greco-Roman authors. By the Byzantine era it mainly referred to the most important pass between the Caucasus and Northern Iran, the pass of Derbent. It was also known as \\"the Gate\\" or \\"the Gate of Gates\\". An Armenian translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes' Alexander Romance instead identifies the Caspian Gates with the territory of Talis. Guidoboni, Traina, 1995, p. 120-121 In the 19th century, Karl Ernst Adolf von Hoff and Robert Mallet theorized that the Caspian Gates should be identified with the pass of Dariel, which was located near the Black Sea.

Biography Wilhelmine Moik was born 26 September 1894 in Vienna as one of a total of nine children of a toolmaker and a seamstress in the Viennese district Ottakring. She worked with her mother and siblings sewing bed linen in the cramped quarters of their home. At the age of 17, she was forced to spend several months in hospital as a result of a lung ailment. One day after her 18th birthday Moik joined the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDAP) and got her first job in the Domestic Workers Association. She had learned of the use and value of trade unions from her father and had attended meetings of the Social Democratic Labour Party and the Free Trade Unions. In 1916 she was employed by the Association of Housemaids and homeworkers and then, when she was working within the trade union commission, she became an employee of Anna Boschek, the first trade unionist in parliament. Moik became engaged in women's issues in the union and society. In 1927 she was elected women secretary of the Confederation of Free Trade Unions. From 1927 to 1934 she worked closely with Käthe Leichter who was murdered in 1942 in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. From 1932 to 1934 Moik was deputy of the SDAP in the Vienna City Council. In February 1934, after the unions were outlawed, Moik became deeply involved in the cause of her party and Socialist Workers' Assistance. She spoke, gave lectures, supplied money, food, and clothing to the unionists. Because of her activities, Moik was arrested repeatedly. She spent time in prison in 1934, 1937, from 1938 to 1941 and 1944. After her release in 1941, she found work as a shorthand typist in a Vienna insurance company. After the war, in November 1945, Moik was elected as a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) in the National Council, to which she belonged from December 1945 to December 1962. ]Moik wrebuilt the unions in Austria and worked for the concerns of women and social issues. She was in part responsible for the General Social Security Act 1955 and in 1957, the Maternity Protection Act. From 1948 to 1963 she was also the chairman of the Vienna SPÖ women. Moik, who never married and had no children, died in Bad Vöslau in 1970.

Kagiyama won gold at the 2019–20 Japan Junior Championships by over 37 points ahead of Shun Sato and Lucas Tsuyoshi Honda. As junior national champion, Kagiyama was named to represent Japan at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics and the 2020 World Junior Championships. He was also invited to compete in the senior division at the 2019–20 Japan Championships, alongside the rest of the top six finishers in the junior division. Competing at the 2019–20 Japan Championships, Kagiyama placed seventh in the short program and second in the free skate, to win the senior national bronze medal. He was not selected to compete at the 2020 World Championships, but was assigned as one of Japan's three entries at the 2020 Four Continents Championships, in addition to his previously-earned berth to the 2020 World Junior Championships. Kagiyama was chosen by the Japanese Olympic Committee as the flag-bearer for the Japanese national team at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics. He won gold at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics ahead of Russians Andrei Mozalev and Daniil Samsonov. Kagiyama was selected by draw to be a member of Team Focus for the team event. He won the men's free skating portion to help Team Focus win the silver medal. At the Four Continents Championships, Kagiyama scored a personal-best 91.61 in his short program, beating his old mark by almost seven points and placing fifth in the segment. He rose to the bronze medal overall in the free skate, his first senior ISU championship medal, calling it \\"a precious time and experience. I was able to get closer to what I wanted to achieve.\\" Finishing the season at the 2020 World Junior Championships, Kagiyama won the short program ahead of Andrei Mozalev. After opening his free skate with a fall on a quad toe loop, he performed the remaining jumps successfully until singling a planned triple Axel as his closing jump, and placed fifth in that segment. He remained narrowly in second place overall, ahead of Petr Gumennik, and won the silver medal. Speaking afterward, he said \\"I felt like my body and my mind were not connected\\" and attributed the errors to that.  2020–2021 season  Kagiyama was assigned to compete at the 2020 NHK Trophy.  Records and achievements  * Set the junior-level men's combined total record (234.87 points) at 2019 JGP France.

Maria Matilda, Marquise de Blaisel (born Maria Matilda Bingham 1783 – 1849) was an American born heiress who married several prominent European aristocrats and statesmen. Early life Maria was born in Binghamton, New York in 1783. She was the second daughter of William Bingham and Ann Willing Bingham. Her elder sister, Ann Louisa Bingham, became the wife of Alexander Baring, in 1798. Baring later became the first Baron Ashburton. Her younger brother, William Bingham, was married to Marie-Charlotte Chartier de Lotbiniere, Seigneuresse de Rigaud, the second daughter and co-heiress of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière. Following her birth, her father was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania from 1786 to 1788. He later served as a U.S. Senator and President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate in 1797. Bingham helped broker the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and was one of the richest men in America, having made his fortune during the American Revolution through trading and ownership of privateers. After her father's death in 1804, Maria and her sister both stayed in England. Her maternal grandfather was Thomas Willing, who served as president of the First Bank of the United States. Personal life Maria married three times. On April 11, 1799, at the age of 15, she became the Comtesse de Tilly upon her elopement and secret marriage to French aristocrat, (1761–1816), in Philadelphia. After the marriage's quick end, Tilly \\"demanded an annual pension as his price to leave the country,\\" and wrote to Maria \\"insisting he would have the rights to her inheritance upon the death of her wealthy parents.\\" He was paid £5,000 and an annual pension of £500, and, in March 1800, \\"the Philadelphia newspapers announced that the Pennsylvania state legislature had passed an act declaring null and voide the marriage of Maria Matilda and Alexandre de Tilly.\\" After their brief marriage, he returned to Europe, where the King of Prussia named him his chamberlain in 1801. According to Tilly, her mother, who died shortly after the episode, was a lover of Louis-Marie, vicomte de Noailles (the brother-in-law of the Marquis de Lafayette), who had introduced Tilly to Maria and was her father's business partner. On 19 April 1802, she married her sister's brother-in-law, Henry Baring (1777–1848) in England. Henry, a son of Harriet (née Herring) Baring and Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, served as a Member of Parliament for Colchester and Bossiney during their marriage. Before their 1824 divorce, Maria and Henry were the parents of five children, three sons and two daughters, including: * Anna Maria Baring (b. 1803), who married William Gordon Coesvelt. * Henry Bingham Baring (1804–1869), a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Callington in Cornwall. He later represented the Marlborough constituency in Wiltshire. He married Lady Augusta Brudenell, a daughter of Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan, in 1827. * James Drummond Baring (1806–1901) * Frances Emily Baring (1813–1886), who married Henry Bridgeman Simpson in 1830. * William Frederick Baring (1822–1903), who married Emily Jenkins, daughter of Sir Richard Jenkins (chairman of the East India Company), in 1845. After their divorce, her husband remarried to married Cecilia Anne Windham, a daughter of Vice-Admiral William Lukin Windham, with whom he had another eight children. On April 17, 1826, at the Chapel of the British Ambassador in Paris, she was married Auguste, Marquis de Blaisel (1790–1870), thereby becoming the Marquise de Blaisel.

Prerequisites  The disaster on Chernobyl Atomic Power Station on April 26, 1986 gave birth to a massive national-democratic movement which had a turning point in 1989. From the very beginning, the Communist Party’s authorities resorted to silencing and falsifying the causes, scope, and consequences of the Chernobyl accident. It was necessary to communicate to the population of Ukraine and the world community the information about real threats, the elimination of which was impossible under conditions of the totalitarian regime. The All-Ukrainian Environmental Campaign provided a certain impetus to the social and political processes in Ukraine, which culminated in the proclamation of state independence.  Event  To make the campaign possible, the Regulations on the All-Ukrainian Environmental Campaign were approved by the Head of Narodniy Rukh Secretariat Mykhailo Horyn, and the Chairman of the “Green World” Environmental Association Yuriy Shcherbak. A copy of the Regulation was sent in advance to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Valentina Shevchenko. Without waiting for a response, on October 28, the participants started the campaign as planned. All-Ukrainian Environmental Campaign took place along the following route: Netishyn (Khmelnitsky Atomic Power Station) – Slavuta – Shepetivka – Novohrad-Volynskyi – Korosten – Ovruch – Narodychi – Poliske – Ivankiv – Vyshgorod – Kyiv. The purpose of the campaign was multifaceted. It was necessary to break the information blockade, distribute materials of patriotic publications with the Program and Charter of the Movement, information about political, environmental, linguistic situation in Ukraine, national symbols and more. It was planned to collect as many signatures as possible under the Appeal to M. Gorbachev, the President of the USSR, demanding to stop the atomic minelaying of Ukraine, and to solve the issue of the construction and operation of nuclear power plants independently through the referendums. Participants of the campaign were members of public and political organizations of patriotic orientation (Narodniy Rukh, Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian Language Society, “Green World” Environmental Association and “Memorial” society). The majority of the participants of the campaign were residents of Brovary and Brovary Region: Valeriy Sereda (chairman of the organizing committee), Ivan Odinets, Natalka Radchenko, Volodymyr Siroklin, Vasyl Stashenko, Anatoly Fedyk, Volodymyr Shvab (commander of the group), Vasyl Shust. From the very beginning, the authorities interfered with the campaign, provoked actions against its participants along the route.  Results  Participants of the All-Ukrainian Environmental Campaign in Moscow. December 16, 1989 During the Campaign, the levels of radioactive contamination were determined, and explanatory work among the population was conducted (some of the participants of the Campaign were scientists – doctors and candidates of physical and mathematical sciences from the Institute of Nuclear Research). More than 500 thousand signatures were collected under the address to the President of the USSR M. Gorbachev. The collection of signatures started all over Ukraine before the beginning of the campaign. For that purpose the Secretariat of Narodniy Rukh had sent out the Letter of Appeal to all its Regional Organizations. Signatures were delivered to the Secretariat of Narodniy Rukh. The signatures were collected by December 16, 1989. The signed appeals were passed by the group of participants of the campaign in Moscow to the USSR People’s Deputies Y. Shcherbak, V. Yavorivsky, M. Kutsenko who delivered them to the President of the USSR M. Gorbachev. On November 25-26, 1989, the participants of the environmental campaign represented Ukraine in the work of the Peoples’ Assembly “Chornobyl Way” in Minsk, where they had to resolve the issues of interaction during the second stage of the Environmental Campaign with the delegates from Belarus and Lithuania, where the Campaign was also to be held. The Lithuanian representatives noted that they had chosen the path to restoring Lithuania’s state independence, so they could not participate in the event. Immediately, at the proposal of the members of the Ecological Board of the Grand Council of Narodniy Rukh of Ukraine Yevgen Korbetsky, Volodymyr Confederatenko, Valeriy Sereda, a meeting of plenipotentiary representatives of the national fronts and movements of Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Ukraine was held and the Protocol about the common actions was signed, which recommended that the peoples’ fronts and movements of these republics immediately direct all efforts to achieve state independence. After the end of the campaign, the local cells of Narodniy Rukh, “Green World” Environmental Association, Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian Language Society were created in the cities along the route of the action.  Information resonance  The campaign was highlighted in the following newspapers: New Life (Environmental Campaign) No. 169 of 21.10.89, Newsletter of Narodniy Rukh Secretariat “Bulletin of the Movement” (“Get into Environmental Campaign”) No. 1 of 10.89, “Working Word \\"(\\" On the route of Netishyn - Kiev \\") № 214-21 of 28.10.89, and (“Green World of Hope”) No. 225 of 15.11.89, “Molod Ukrayiny” (“Entrance… forbidden?”) No. 211 of 2.11.89, “Soviet Flag” (“Time of Joint Efforts”) No. 176—177 of 4.11.89, “Komsomol Star” (“We Want to Live!”) No. 137 of 14.11.89 etc. The campaign was highlighted by the correspondents of radio “Svoboda”, “Voice of America”.

She has written four books: a memoir titled A Rip in Heaven and three novels: The Outside Boy, The Crooked Branch, and American Dirt.  Biography  Cummins was born in Rota, Spain, where her father, Gene, was stationed as a member of the US Navy. Her mother, Kay, was a nurse. Cummins spent her childhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland and attended Towson University, where she majored in English and communications. In 1993 Cummins was a finalist in the Rose of Tralee festival, an international event that is celebrated among Irish communities all over the world; at each festival in Tralee, Ireland, a woman is crowned the Rose. After university she spent two years working as a bartender in Belfast, Northern Ireland, before moving back to the United States in 1997 and beginning work at Penguin in New York City. She worked in the publishing industry for 10 years. Her 2004 memoir, A Rip in Heaven, focuses on the attempted murder of her brother, Tom, and the murder of two of her cousins on the Chain of Rocks Bridge in St. Louis, Missouri, when Cummins was 16. She declined offers for film rights to the book. Her next two novels explore Irish history. The Outside Boy (2010) is about Pavee travellers. The Crooked Branch (2013) is about the Great Famine of Ireland. These books will be published for the first time in Ireland in 2020. Cummins' 2020 novel, American Dirt, tells the story of a mother and bookstore owner in Acapulco, Mexico, who attempts to escape to the United States with her son after their family is killed by a drug cartel. In 2018 the book was sold to Flatiron after a three-day bidding war between nine publishers that resulted in a seven-figure deal. From 2018 until its publication in January 2020, the book received roundly positive reviews. However, approximately one month before the release of the book, a negative review from Myriam Gurba was published in Tropics of Meta. Then, a week before the release of the book, a string of critical reviews was published, starting with a review in the New York Times. In these reviews, Cummins was accused of exploitation and inaccuracy in her portrayals of both Mexico and the migrant experience. They also pointed out that Cummins was of European heritage and had previously identified as \\"White.\\" On the same day as the book's release, Oprah Winfrey announced that American Dirt would be the 83rd book chosen for Oprah's Book Club. On January 30, 2020, Cummins' publisher, Flatiron, cancelled her planned book tour, citing fear for her safety. Cummins has indicated that her next book will be set in Puerto Rico.  Family and heritage  Jeanine Cummins identifies as White, stating in a December 2015 New York Times opinion piece: \\"I still don't want to write about race. What I mean is, I really don't want to write about race... I am white.\\" Additionally, her grandmother was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and in an interview with Shelf Awareness Cummins stated: \\"I'm Latinx.\\" Her husband is from Ireland and was an undocumented immigrant in the US for 10 years.

It was opened by Joseph Bellotti in 1930 in the basement of the building where The Double Header was located. It was known as one of the places most welcoming of gays on the West Coast. History The Casino was a venue occupying the space of the former People's Theater, which had been in operation from 1890 to 1904. The club was run by John and Margaret Delevitti, a heterosexual couple that cared for gays in the city. The club was known as one of the places most welcoming of gays on the West Coast, and became popular with drag queens. At the time, it was not widely allowed for men to dance together, but they were allowed to do so at The Casino, because the establishment paid off local policemen. This fact made the establishment popular, via an underground network of information about nightlife for gays and lesbians, and caused it to be known as something of a speakeasy. Prior to the legalization of dancing of same-sex couples, same-sex contact at The Casino was primarily through conversations and stealthy eye contact via the bar's mirrors. In the mid-1950s, The Casino was converted into a diner. It was named in a 1966 investigative article in The Seattle Times as one of the bars which attracted a gay clientele; the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board had added The Casino to a list of 14 bars \\"under investigation for homosexual activity\\", but for unspecified reasons recommended that it be \\"dropped from observation\\". Legacy Interdisciplinary artist Storme Webber created a 2017 museum exhibition called Casino: A Palimpsest, based on her memories of visiting the establishment with her mother in the 1960s. She experienced The Casino during its history as a diner, but still as an important meeting place for marginalized communities. The exhibit was displayed at the Frye Art Museum.

Also on the Special General Election Ballot were Libertarian Party nominee Bill Slantz and Constitution Party nominee Doug Enyart. Smith was easily elected on June 4, 2013, taking 68 percent of the vote and was sworn-in by House Speaker John Boehner on June 5, 2013 in a ceremony that was attended by most of Missouri's Congressional Delegation, Emerson and Missouri's Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Massachusetts's 5th congressional district On June 25, 2013, 19-term U.S. Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) defeated Republican Gabriel Gomez in the special election to fill the remaining 18-months of the unexpired term of the Class II United States Senate seat caused by Sen. John Kerry's confirmation as Secretary of State. Markey resigned from the House of Representatives on July 15, 2013. The special election was scheduled for December 10, 2013. Its primary elections took place on October 15. The Democrat is state senator Katherine Clark and the Republican is lawyer Frank Addivinola. Clark defeated Addivinola on December 10, 2013, with 66 percent of the vote and was sworn-in by Boehner on December 12, 2013. Alabama's 1st congressional district On May 23, 2013, Republican U.S. Rep. Jo Bonner announced his intention to resign from Congress to become the vice chancellor of government relations and economic development with the University of Alabama System., with his resignation becoming effective at midnight on August 15, 2013. This was later moved up to August 2. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley set the dates for the special election. Primary elections were held on September 24. The Democratic primary was won by Burton LeFlore, a real estate agent, with 70.2% of the vote. On the Republican side, the top two vote-getters in the primary, Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, and Dean Young, a businessman, advanced to a runoff on November 5. Byrne won the runoff, thus becoming his party's nominee. Byrne then went on to win the general election on December 17 by a wide margin. Louisiana's 5th congressional district On August 6, 2013, six-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Rodney Alexander announced plans to not seek a 7th term, citing the partisan gridlock in Congress. On August 7, 2013, Alexander announced that he would not serve the remaining time left in his term and would instead resign effective September 26, 2013, and became the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs under Governor Bobby Jindal. On August 8, 2013, Jindal issued an executive order setting the dates for the special election with the primary being held on October 19, 2013, and the general election on November 16, 2013.

Biography John Crowder was born in Buckinghamshire in 1756. He served his apprenticeship to a printer, and at the expiration of his time, went to London, and obtained a situation in his majesty's printing office, then under the control of William Strahan. About 1780, he obtained an engagement in the printing office of Francis Blyth, printer and part proprietor of the Public Ledger, a daily morning paper, and the London Packet, an evening paper, published three times a week. Both these papers had been for some years supported by the productions of Goldsmith, Kelly, and others. This engagement, in which Crowder took a very active part, continued until 1787, the time of Blyth's death, when Crowder, who the year before had married Blyth's niece, Mary Ann James (died November 1823), succeeded to the management of the whole concern. This he carried on for upwards of thirty years; and, during this period, was frequently employed in printing valuable works for the booksellers. He finally left the business in 1820, when he had amassed a considerable fortune by some successful speculations. Residing, as he had during almost the whole of his life, in the ward of Farringdon Within, he was, in 1800, elected one of their representatives in the common council, afterwards became one of their deputies, (this ward had two) and on the death of Thomas Smith, esq. was elected alderman on 1 May 1823. In 1825 he was elected sheriff by the livery at large. On his retirement from the shrievalty, he continued to perform the duties of alderman. On 9 November 1829 he entered on his mayoralty, and in the same year, served as Master of the Company of Stationers. In mid-September 1830 his health became slowly but seriously affected. On 9 November 1830 he was removed in a very feeble state to his house at Hammersmith, where he lingered till 2 December, when he died, aged seventy-four years. His remains were interred in the parish church of Christchurch, Newgate-street. His brother, James Peshlier Crowder, died at Stockwell Common two days before the Alderman.

Bennett was born in 1947 in Nelson, New Zealand. He graduated from the Ilam School of Fine Arts in 1970 where he trained in photography. Interested in the human body and three-dimensional form, he became a sculptor, often combining natural materials (wood, stone) with stainless steel and bronze. Bennett lives in Christchurch as a full-time artist. Bennett installed Sea/Sky Kaipara at Gibbs Farm in 1994. He is represented with four sculptures in the Brick Bay Sculpture Trail outdoor gallery at Snells Beach north of Auckland. For the World Firefighters Games held in Christchurch in October/November 2002, Bennett sculpted A Tribute to Firefighters from steel girders from the World Trade Centre destroyed in the September 11 attacks donated by the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg. The sculpture is placed on the banks for the Avon River immediately adjacent to the Central Fire Station in the central city in the Firefighters Reserve that was built for the games. A few months later, Reasons for Voyaging was installed in front of the Christchurch Art Gallery in 2003, consisting of seven angled stainless steel poles that are up to tall. Bennett was one of five artists in residency at the 2012 Seoul International Sculpture Festa, with his commissioned worked, Tipping Point, permanently installed by Crown Confectionery in the Art Valley sculpture park in Haitai, South Korea. In 2013, he had residency at Lincoln University. During this time, he produced Oversight, a sculpture installed in front of the School of Landscape Architecture.

She is known for her work on how the cerebellum controls coordinated movement.  Education and Early Career  Carey completed her Bachelor and Master degrees at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. She received her PhD in 2005 from University of California at San Francisco where she studied neural mechanisms of motor learning in Stephen Lisberger's lab. She received the Krevans Distinguished Dissertation Award for her work. Carey completed her postdoctoral work at Harvard Medical School as a Helen Hay Whitney Fellow in Wade Regehr's lab. There, she focused on the cell biology of neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity. Since 2010, she has been an independent group leader of the Neural Circuits and Behavior Laboratory.  Research  Carey's work focuses on the quantitative analysis of movement, using behavior, genetics, and physiology to dissect locomotion. She is interested in understanding how the cerebellum controls coordinated movement. Her research group is focused on creating quantitative methodology to study coordinated movement. She developed an automated movement tracking system, called \\"LocoMouse\\" to capture and analyze paw, nose, and tail movements of normal mice and of mice affected by ataxia defects. Using this system, she discovered that the forward steps of the ataxic Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice are normal, but instead they have difficulty coordinating their movement. The tracking system dissects movement defects quantitatively to more precisely pinpoint phenotypic defects. Her group recently uncovered an unexpected link between movement and learning. While examining a type of learning called \\"eyeblink conditioning\\" in mice, Carey and her team noticed that the time to condition was highly variable between individuals and difficult to track. They noticed though, that by keeping all animals walking at a similar pace on motorized wheels, the variability diminished and the animals learned the task at a similar rate. Surprisingly, if the animals then started moving at a faster pace, they learned the task quicker. Carey also studies how changes in walking are learned through cerebellar circuits. To study this, her group built a special \\"split-belt\\" treadmill for mice. Using this device, mice learn to modulate their walking so that their front paws and back paws land at the same time, even though each side is moving at a different speed. They discovered that inhibiting neural circuits in the cerebellum, but not the cerebral cortex, was a detriment to learning the walking behavior. In 2015, she received an ERC starting grant, and in 2020, she received an ERC consolidator grant for her work.

It was founded in 2015 by Michelle D. Jones, Ph.D. Wayfinding Academy offers a non-traditional, partially self-directed educational model to its students, who are encouraged to “live life on purpose”. Jones is the Founder, President, and Chief Academic Officer. Students graduate from the program with an Associates of Arts degree in Self and Society. As of January 2020, 19 students have completed the two-year program. The college is authorized by the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission.  HISTORY  After 16 years working in the higher education system (including at Concordia University, Providence College, and University of Puget Sound), Michelle Jones decided to create a new kind of college that would focus on helping students connect with “their passions and purpose.” Along with friends and supporters, she launched an Indiegogo campaign that broke the record for the most successful Indiegogo campaign in Oregon history. Jones announced the idea for the college and the campaign at the World Domination Summit in 2015.  Educational program   Core curriculum  Wayfinding Academy’s core curriculum consists of nine core courses “designed to cultivate good humans.” These courses are designed to be experiential and discussion-based.  Labs  The core curriculum is complemented by short workshops called Labs, which are open to the public in addition to Wayfinding students. Labs focus on a specific topic or skillset and have included topics such as Hip Hop, immigration, conflict resolution, gender and sexuality, social media, personal finance, and Pacific Northwest ecology.  Guides  Each student has their own Guide who provides support and helps them make connections throughout the 2-year program. Generally, students remain with the same Guide for the duration of their time at Wayfinding.  Internship and Self-Directed Projects  Students are required to complete two internships or self-directed projects during their time at Wayfinding, in order to gain real-world experience, contribute to the Portland community, and get a clearer understanding of what work they might want to do.  Living Portfolio  Each student creates a portfolio of projects completed during their time at Wayfinding. This portfolio serves as a representation of their interests, capabilities, and growth over the course of the program.  Learn & Explore Trips  During breaks between terms, Wayfinding Academy offers trips for students and supporters to learn about other cultures and have new experiences. Past trips include the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage, Tuscany, Ghana, and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.  Student demographics  The average age of all alumni and current enrollees is 21.4, with 51 percent between 20-25, 28 percent between 18-19, and 15 percent between 26-28. Nine percent identify as first-generation college attendees. Seventeen percent of currently enrolled students and alumni identify as people of color. Sixty percent of non-dependent Wayfinding students fall below the federal poverty line and a majority of all Wayfinding students fall into the category of bottom 50 percent of U.S. household income.  TUITION  Part of Wayfinding Academy’s mission is making college education affordable for all students. Currently, the college charges $11,000 a year for tuition.

Career Acting Murray's acting career began at the age of 10 when he starred opposite John Hannah, Stratford Johns and James Cosmo in the Channel 4 TV series, Brond, directed by Michael Caton-Jones. His character was murdered after being thrown off the Gibson Street Bridge in Glasgow. Murray's Theatre roles include playing Tommy in the 2006 No. 1 UK Tour of Irvine Welsh’s international smash hit Trainspotting performing in such theatres as King's Theatre, Edinburgh, Dundee Repertory Theatre, His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen, Grand Opera House, Belfast, Sherman Theatre Cardiff, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, The Lowry Manchester, Oxford Playhouse, Leicester Haymarket Theatre, Theatre Royal, Bath and the Hackney Empire London.

Murray performed Big Sean, Mikey and Me and Bath Time live at Soho Radio London in 2015. Murray is known for writing dark comedies incorporating strong Scottish themes, with Allie being Murray's first drama. Critical acclaim Alex Eades’ said in his 4 star The List review of Murray's play The Club starring Murray and English actor Mark Farrelly, “The performances are magnetic, sparking a wonderful chemistry in this exhilarating and utterly intoxicating razor sharp dark comedy.” Nick Awde's 4 star review in The Stage of The Club said, “There’s a huge amount of promise in this one-acter and you can see this effortlessly expanded to TV.” The Stage’s Thom Dibdin wrote in his review of Big Sean, Mikey and Me, ‘MUST SEE! Murray illuminates the psyche of Scottish youth culture.’ The Metro’s Damon Smith wrote in his 4 star review of Big Sean, Mikey and Me, “Murray’s bravura performance goes from the sublime to the ridiculous in his impressive one man show.” The Herald's theatre critic Neil Cooper's 4 star review of Bath Time said, ‘It’s a bleak and brutal picture that Murray paints, but this exquisitely constructed little firecracker of a show is possessed with an energy and a common touch that makes it irresistible.’ BBC critic Robert Jackman's 5 star review of Irvine Welsh's play Trainspotting said of Murray's performance, “Welsh’s wit is transferred perfectly to stage as Renton and Tommy’s blend of horror and humour reaches almost schizophrenic level.

In November 1989, Neiva came across a flock of hyacinth macaws in the Pantanal and, knowing that they were in danger of extinction, she began to work on cataloguing and conserving the species with her own means. Illegal capture for the pet bird trade, habitat destruction and feather collection for handicrafts were the main reasons for the drastic reduction in hyacinth macaw numbers. Biography Neiva was born in 1962, in Ponta Porã, in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Initially, Neiva wanted to study medicine and become a pediatrician, but she did not pass the entrance examination. Then she begun taking part in the biology course which took place at night, allowing her to work during the day to help her family. She graduated in biology from the Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul in 1987. In 1990, she entered the master's degree program at Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, studying the reproductive biology of the hyacinth macaw of the Pantanal. Still a recent graduate, in 1989 Neiva first saw the hyacinth macaw in the Pantanal. Upon discovering that they were in danger of extinction she reasoned that the best way to preserve the species would be to study the causes of their disappearance, monitoring the remaining individuals, mapping nests, counting eggs and chicks. At the time, there was little research on hyacinth macaws, and Neiva's research work was the main generator of information on hyacinth macaw populations, their ways of life and reproduction. While studying for her master's, she travelled to the Pantanal from the municipality of Miranda, replicating her studies. With help from the World Wide Fund for Nature, she learned to climb trees to access the nests of the hyacinth macaws. Neiva discovered that hyacinth macaws are \\"environmental engineers\\" of nature: Their nests, which are built in cavities in trees, are also used by other species, and the macaws help spread seeds to more distant locations from the mother plant. Towards the end of the 1980s it was estimated that the population of hyacinth macaws numbered less than 1500 individuals. By 2019, circa 6500 individual hyacinth macaws lived in the Pantanal alone, not counting additional individuals elsewhere in the cerrado biome. Neiva's work also revealed that the main obstacle to the species' reproduction was the lack of nesting cavities for the animals and their young, causing birds to quarrel for the few good spaces available. Thus, Neiva and her co-workers started installing wooden nesting boxes on top of the trees. Farmers allowed the researchers to enter to install nesting boxes and even started planting trees to facilitate the hyacinth macaws' reproduction. In 2005, Neiva began her doctorate at the Universidade Estadual Paulista, where she successfully defended her thesis in 2009 on continuation of her work with the hyacinth macaws. Today, Neiva is one of the most eminent specialists on hyacinth macaws in Latin America. She is a professor at the Universidade para o Desenvolvimento do Estado e da Região do Pantanal and has been president of the Instituto Arara Azul for 30 years. Instituto Arara Azul Hyacinth macaw of the Pantanal The Hyacinth Macaw Institute (Portuguese: Instituto Arara Azul) was created in 2003 in the Pantanal. It is responsible for promoting conservation of hyacinth macaws, biodiversity in the Pantanal through engaging people and raising awareness in the populace about rational use of natural resources. It is a non-profit civilian organization with administrative and financial autonomy thanks to partnerships with private and public entities. Beyond studying hyacinth macaws, the institute also studies the reproductive biology of red-and-green macaws, toucans, hawks, owls, muscovy ducks, and other species that coexist with hyacinth macaws in the Pantanal. In total, the institute surveys an area of more than 400 thousand hectares, monitoring circa 615 nests, spread across 57 farms, and 5000 birds throughout the Pantanal. The institute is globally recognized as a top authority on parrot research, and has educated professionals in Brazil and beyond. In 2019, Neiva was nominated for the Prêmio Faz Diferença (English: Make a Difference Award), a partnership between the Brazilian newspaper O Globo and the Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

It is published since 1983 in Turin (Italy) by the Piedmont Regional Government. History and profile Some old paper issues Piemonte Parchi was the first magazine published by an Italian public administration devoted to nature conservation. Its first issue was published in November 1983 and soon the journal won a widespread praise. The magazine consisted in a quarterly supplement of Notizie, the official newspaper of the Regione Piemonte; in 1985 the magazine redoubled its pages (which from that year on were all printed in colours) and became bimonthly, and then monthly. During the early 1990s, to support its policy on nature conservation, the Regional Department for nature parks (Assessorato regionale ai parchi) printed each month around 50,000 copies of the magazine, which were sent free of charge to schools, local administrations, associations and private citizens, to inform them about the situation of the already existing nature parks in the region and the projects of new establishments. Since 1993, aiming to rationalise expenditure of the regional administration, the magazine started to be provided on the basis of paid subscriptions. Its circulation in 1997 decreased to 35,000 copies per issue. Besides its ordinary issues from 1999 on Piemonte Parchi publishes every year two tematic issues, devoted to specific topics as, for instance, Il ritorno del lupo (The return of wolves), Gli ecomusei (Ecomuseums), La speleologia in Piemonte (Speleology in Piedmont), I parchi in Europa (Nature parks in Europe) and so on. From 2001 Piemonte Parchi is on the Internet, registered as Piemonte Parchi Web, where it is flanked by an online news bulletin with the events taking place in the Piedmontese parks, and by a weekly newsletter. In 2004 Piemonte Parchi launched Piemonte Parchi Web Junior, a web project addressed to schools, which ended in 2011. In the months preceding Turin 2006 Winter Olympics the journal launched an intensive information campaign on the event. With the 221th issue of December 2012, following a time of crisis when Piemonte Parchi risked a complete closure due to Regione Piemonte budgetary cuts, after almost 30 years of activity the magazine sharply reduced its paper format issues per year. From then on the magazine mainly goes on as a free of charge online newspaper. Contents and sections are roughly the same of the historic paper journal, and also the newsletter is still operating. Contents Major aim of Piemonte Parchi is to provide news about the nature reserves features and activities in Piedmont, Italy and abroad. It also deals with environmental and life science issues such as geology, climatology, ornithology, zoology and botanics. Its articles also cover territorial issues as local history and traditional products. Among the contributors of Piemonte Parchi there are prominent personalities of the Italian environmentalism as, for instance, Mario Rigoni Stern, Reinhold Messner, Antonio Cederna, Laura Conti and Piero Angela. Since 1991 Piemonte Parchi maintains a public library named \\"Biblioteca delle aree protette\\" (\\"Conservation areas library\\"), which was confirmed in 2009 by a legge regionaleLegge regionale nr.19 of 29/6/2009 Testo unico sulla tutela delle aree naturali e della biodiversità, on-line version: and offers consultation and loans of works related to Conservation biology.

He began working for Newcastle upon Tyne Council, and in 1908 formed the first branch of the National Union of Clerks (NUC) in North East England. He soon formed a Northern Council in the union, promoting the creation of other branches in the area.The Clerk (1923) In 1910, Lindsley was selected to contest Barkston Ash for the Labour Party.

Due to the outbreak of World War I, no election was held until 1918, and by that time, Lindsley's political views had changed. A strong supporter of British involvement in the war, he resigned from the ILP, and joined the National Democratic and Labour Party (NDP), standing unsuccessfully for it in Houghton-le-Spring. Lindsley continued his trade union activism, serving as president of Newcastle Trades Council in 1914, and as president of the National Union of Clerks in 1915/16. He also spent a year as the union's paid National Propagandist Organiser, during which he focused on building up union membership in Wales. He then began working in Darlington as a publicity agent, making him ineligible to hold office in the NUC.

Por Gral. Oscar E. Guerrero.  Reasons of the Split  As the campaign for the 1973 presidential elections progressed, in which Peronism presented the Cámpora-Solano Lima formula, the Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT, the ERP party) continued to denounce Perón as a \\"tool of the regime bourgeois\\". ERP members who disagreed with this position were separated after the meeting of the Central Committee in December 1972 (the first in which Mario Santucho was present after returning from his exile in Cuba), in which they concluded that It was impossible to continue within the organization. There were also other ERP members who separated from the organization for other reasons.  Fundation of ERP-22  On January 15, 1973, at a campsite in Buenos Aires, the ERP-August 22 held its founding congress. Almost all of its militants from the Buenos Aires Regional and the Military Committee of the ERP Capital. The initial structure of the ERP-22 was a copy of the command line that the splinters had when they were part of the ERP. In addition, the new ERP-22 made no distinction between party and army, leaving its name linked to the latter. On March 8, 1978, the Eduardo Capello Command publishes a statement speaking and encouraging Argentine society to vote in favor of FREJULI, in the elections of March 11, 1973, calling the people \\"to defeat the dictatorship at the polls, through the mass vote to the FREJULI lists \\"and\\" mobilize to verify compliance with these modifications. \\"The sympathy and the workers' and people's support that awakens is the one that brings together the greatest possibilities of defeating the government maneuver at the polls\\". The date of the name refers to the day of 1972 in which the first large-scale joint operation of the ERP, Montoneros and Peronist Armed Forces (FAP) guerrillas takes place in order to free many of their main chiefs imprisoned in the Rawson criminal. On November 11, 1973 the group also organized a tribute to the villero leader of the San Pablo neighborhood and militant Nemesio Aquino, a well-known l\\"ocal revolutionary and militant who the group describes as \\"the worker who knew how to embrace the ideas of revolutionary Marxism and build the organization political- military essential to galvanize the progress of the people in their struggle for power\\".  Important Armed Actions   Kidnapping of Héctor Ricardo García  Héctor Ricardo García, owner of Crónica, was kidnapped for guerrillas The first action of ERP-22 was the kidnapping of the owner of the newspaper Crónica, Héctor Ricardo García. Héctor Ricardo García. It was called \\"Operation Poniatowski\\" because one of the guerrillas had read about a French politician named Jozef Antoni Poniatowski and, in contrast to the common surname García, on 22 he puts that name to the operation.«Operación Poniatowski, secuestro de Héctor Ricardo García, propietario del diario Crónica.» Publicado en Liberación por la Patria Socialista, nº 22, 8 de marzo de 1973. Reproducido en la base de datos del Centro de Documentación de los Movimientos Armados. Operation Poniatowski is planned for March 6, 1973, but due to problems in one of the cars, it is postponed to day 8, when it is actually executed, under the responsibility of Víctor José Fernández Palmeiro, known as \\"el Gallego\\". At 8:20 local time they park a van and descend three guerrillas dressed in work clothes and carrying boxes of whiskey. The van leaves and they avoid the obstacle of the doorman of the building where García lived because he was not there. Previously, four combatants had been distributed in the nearby square with concealed machine guns in case complications occurred. Garcia's maids opened them because they presented the card of the mayor of Buenos Aires, Saturnino Montero Ruiz, as the one who sent the gifts. The guerrillas reduced the staff and came to Garcia, who slept next to a well-known television artist, and reassured him, while another militant arrived to pretend to be the maid in case some unforeseen event happened. The ERP-22 required to release the publication, on the front page of the newspaper, of a statement calling to vote for FreJuLi. Garcia spoke with the director of the newspaper's evening edition to inform him of the statement he should publish. Then, the owner of Chronicle was taken to an ERP-22 dependent house, where he was held twelve hours until the newspaper edition came out, when he was released. At first it was believed that everything had been a maneuver to promote itself and although this theory was suggested, the editor knew that he had gone through a difficult experience and the ERP-August 22 had taken his first blow to affirm its independent existence.  Battle of Maschwitz  logo oficial empleado por el ERP-22 In April 1973, the dictatorship was dying. The president Lanusse orders the Army to go out on raking and control missions, especially in the Gran Buenos Aires. The ERP-22 decides to make fun of these operations by taking the town of Engineer Maschwitz, near the capital of the country.«Operación Maschwitz.» Publicado en Liberación por la Patria Socialista, nº 20, 1 de mayo de 1974. Reproducido en la base de datos del Centro de Documentación de los Movimientos Armados. The \\"Operation Maschwitz\\" runs on Saturday 21 of that April. At 9 in the Carupá station, part of the twelve combatants who will be involved in the operation. There the weapons are distributed and uploaded to the vehicles (a Chevrolet 400, a Peugeot 504 and a Pick-Up F-100). Forty-five minutes later, the \`\` El Gallego Palmeiro's car enters the town, runs through it and then returns with the others. At 10.00 each of the operating groups marches to their positions: the first team, five militants, will take the police station; the second, two members, will take the mail and cancel the telegraph; The third with three will take care of the station and the fourth with two will cut the telephone lines. The operation was practically without incident. The objectives (shots, weapons capture and graffiti) were achieved and after that, the guerrillas withdrew. At the police station there was a prisoner who was released and returned the next day on his own. The government made an operative bolt to capture the guerrillas, but they were able to escape. There were no armed clashes with security forces.  Killing of the Counter admiral Quijada  Hermes Quijada, a high ranking marine shot dead for the guerrilla ERP-22 to avenge the deaths of the Trelew massacre A few days before assuming Cámpora - whose candidacy had won - the ERP-22 decided to launch a new action: the \\"Operation Mercury\\", whose objective was to kill the Counter. Hermes Jaw. This marine had been in charge of talking on television on behalf of the FF. & Nbsp; AA. Justifying the Trelew massacre in 1972 At the beginning of April 1973, Intelligence of the ERP-22 had received information about the address of Quijada's house. The guerrillas proceeded to carry out several checks of the area, in order to study their safety and customs: they found as a problem the significant custody of the nearby house of Minister Arturo Mor Roig, but they were able to determine that the sailor usually left his house among the 8:30 and 9:30 in a white Dodge Polara, who previously removed garage from his driver, and did not take a fixed route. Again the responsibility of the operation fell to Víctor José Fernández Palmeiro aka \`\` El Gallego , who prepared a plan that consisted of following Quijada's car with a motorcycle (whose driver would receive a signal from a car parked on the direction taken by Dodge Polara), the passenger would be the \`\` Gallego , who would jump from it and riddle Quijada with a Falcon submachine gun and then get on again and the driver swiftly take him out of the area . A first attempt was made, which failed because the militant in the parked car made the wrong signal to the motorcycle and it took another path. For this failure the operation was postponed until Monday, April 30. However, the following week, the operation would be effectively executed, on Monday April 30.

The albino, of mixed Arabian and Morgan ancestry, was a splendid showhorse and was used as a stud. Cal began keeping some track of Old King's progeny. In six generations, the Thompson brothers had a pure strain of albino horses without pink eyes. After the death of his wife, Cal Thompson married Ruth Hackenberg in 1934 and they moved from Merriman to Naper in 1936 where they acquired an existing ranch along the Niobrara.\\" With References Category:Ranches in Nebraska Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boyd County, Nebraska Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1936 ","title":"White Horse Ranch (Naper, Nebraska)"},{"id":"62568367","text":"Victor Shoichi Koga (1935 - November 3, 2018) was a Japanese-Russian martial artist and trainer.

There he started his martial career by joining the amateur wrestling club of Nihon University, where he was studying medicine. His wrestling tenure was successful, including distinguished participations in the National Sports Festival of Japan and the All-Japan Wrestling Championship. After graduating, he also trained judo in Riichiro Watanabe's dojo in Yokosuka. In 1965, becoming interested in the Russian martial art of sambo, Koga associated with fellow judoka and wrestler Ichiro Hatta in order to pioneer it in Japan. After forming the Japanese Sambo Federation, Koga moved to Soviet Union to learn personally the style. He traveled to many countries to teach before returning to Japan, creating multiple sambo schools. In 1975, in acknowledgement of his efforts, he was granted the title of Master of Sports in sambo.

A member of the Labour Party, she succeeded Jim Fitzpatrick, who was first elected in 1997. Early life and career Begum was born in Shadwell, Tower Hamlets, London to Bengali Muslim parents originally from the village of Ludorpur in Jagannathpur, Sunamganj, Bangladesh. Her Sylheti father, Manir Uddin Ahmed (who died in 2012), was also a Labour Party politician, the Tower Hamlets Community Housing Board Director (2002–2006) and the 2004 Mayor of Tower Hamlets. Begum completed her education at Queen Mary University of London. In her early twenties, Apsana Begum worked as an administrative officer for Tower Hamlets Council, having been recruited through an agency, when the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, held office. In 2017, Begum became the first British Bangladeshi woman elected as Secretary of Tower Hamlets Labour Party. She has been actively involved in local campaigns to protect public services, stating that \\"tackling inequalities and standing up for marginalised communities has always been key to me\\". She presented a petition to Tower Hamlets Council asking the Mayor to reconsider the 2017 budget \\"on the grounds that it is discriminatory to Women and Black and Minority Ethnic residents\\".  Parliamentary career  Apsana Begum was selected to contest the safe Labour seat of Poplar and Limehouse at the 2019 General Election. She was endorsed by the left-wing group Momentum and nominated from an all-women shortlist, which included Tower Hamlets councillor Amina Ali and Progress activist Heather Peto. Begum was endorsed by the then Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott who said > \\"I am delighted that Apsana – a young working class Bengali woman – has put > herself forward to represent the seat where she was born and has lived all > her life. Apsana has a strong record in fighting against the Tories' > austerity agenda – standing up for young people, women and ethnic minorities > in particular.\\" At the general election in December 2019, Begum was elected as MP for Poplar and Limehouse, beating Conservative Sheun Oke by 28,904 votes. This was more than her predecessor Jim Fitzpatrick's 27,712 vote majority in the 2017 general election, and a small increased majority for Labour, albeit on a reduced vote share. Begum is a member of the left-wing Socialist Campaign Group of MPs. She is the UK's first Muslim woman MP to wear the hijab, taking her seat in what has been called the most diverse Parliament ever. On being elected, Begum spoke to the Eye about the series of racist, Islamophobic and misogynistic attacks that she has had to endure and the many barriers facing BAME women when getting involved in public life. During an interview with Dazed she said > \\"It has been quite horrendous\\" ...and it's been quite personalised in terms > of attacks. Before being elected, you see other MPs go through that but you > don't necessarily appreciate the impact it can have on someone as an > individual. But it does – we're all human beings.\\" In response to allegations that the ex-Mayor Lutfur Rahman was behind her political career, Begum told Eastlondonlines: > \\"It is grossly insulting, as well as being rooted in racism and misogyny, to > assume that I have no agency of my own and that I must be a 'proxy' or > 'stooge' for a man I have not spoken to for six years.\\" Begum delivered maiden speech in Parliament during a debate about International Women's Day paying tribute what she described as the \\"rich history of women's struggles for social justice\\" in East London.  COVID-19 and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people  On 9 April 2020, in an article published by Left Foot Forward, Apsana Begum MP raised concerns about impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low-income families and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people, saying > \\"...evidence also suggests that ethnic minority communities are at a greater > risk. This is unsurprising given the proportion of workers from black and > ethnic minority backgrounds being on the front line of the fight against the > virus.\\" Begum tabled Early Day Motion #427 “COVID-19 and BAME Communities” and spoke about this issue during the 2nd Reading debate of the Finance Bill on 27 April 2020. On 12 May, Begum raised this issue again in Parliament, highlighting new data released by Tower Hamlet's Council: > \\"New local figures today show that Tower Hamlets residents of Asian > background are twice as likely to be showing signs of COVID-19, yet > shockingly this is not news per se, but confirmation of what had already > become increasingly clear.

Begum had left her husband's residence and was allocated a one-bed flat worth £330,000 soon afterwards, allegedly jumping a queue of 18,000 people on the waiting list in her local area. A senior executive at Tower Hamlets has received two official complaints concerning Begum's housing allocation. A Labour Party source has said, \\"It's a disgrace these malicious attacks are being published, and she is being forced to relive these traumatic experiences.\\" A council spokesman has said that it takes allegations of housing fraud very seriously.

It is a mark that indicates the acetylation at the 5th lysine residue of the histone H4 protein. H4K5 is the closest lysine residue to the N-terminal tail of histone H4. It is enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) and along gene bodies. Acetylation of histone H4K5 and H4K12ac is enriched at centromeres. Nomenclature H4K5ac indicates acetylation of lysine 5 on histone H4 protein subunit: {  -  Abbr.  Meaning - H4  H4 family of histones -  K  standard abbreviation for lysine -  5  position of amino acid residue (counting from N-terminus) -  ac acetyl group - } Histone modifications The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is wrapped around special protein molecules known as histones. The complexes formed by the looping of the DNA are known as chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: this consists of the core octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as well as a linker histone and about 180 base pairs of DNA. These core histones are rich in lysine and arginine residues. The carboxyl (C) terminal end of these histones contribute to histone-histone interactions, as well as histone-DNA interactions. The amino (N) terminal charged tails are the site of the post-translational modifications, such as the one seen in H3K36me3. H4 histone H4 modifications are not as well known as H3's and H4 has fewer variations which might explain their important function. H4K5ac H4K5 is acetylated by TIP60 and CBP/p300 proteins. CAP/p300 open transcriptional start site chromatin by acetylating histones. H4K5ac has also been implicated in epigenetic bookmarking which allows gene expression patterns to be faithfully passed to daughter cells through mitosis. Important cell-type specific genes are marked in some way that prevents them from being compacted during mitosis and ensures their rapid transcription. H4K5ac appears to prime activity- dependent genes expressed during learning.  Lysine acetylation and deacetylation  Lysine acetylation Proteins are typically acetylated on lysine residues and this reaction relies on acetyl-coenzyme A as the acetyl group donor. In histone acetylation and deacetylation, histone proteins are acetylated and deacetylated on lysine residues in the N-terminal tail as part of gene regulation. Typically, these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, although HATs and HDACs can modify the acetylation status of non-histone proteins as well. The regulation of transcription factors, effector proteins, molecular chaperones, and cytoskeletal proteins by acetylation and deacetylation is a significant post-translational regulatory mechanism These regulatory mechanisms are analogous to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by the action of kinases and phosphatases. Not only can the acetylation state of a protein modify its activity, but this post-translational modification may also crosstalk with phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and others for dynamic control of cellular signaling.  Epigenetic implications  The post-translational modification of histone tails by either histone modifying complexes or chromatin remodeling complexes are interpreted by the cell and lead to complex, combinatorial transcriptional output. It is thought that a histone code dictates the expression of genes by a complex interaction between the histones in a particular region. The current understanding and interpretation of histones comes from two large scale projects: ENCODE and the Epigenomic roadmap. The purpose of the epigenomic study was to investigate epigenetic changes across the entire genome. This led to chromatin states which define genomic regions by grouping the interactions of different proteins and/or histone modifications together. Chromatin states were investigated in Drosophila cells by looking at the binding location of proteins in the genome. Use of ChIP-sequencing revealed regions in the genome characterised by different banding. Different developmental stages were profiled in Drosophila as well, an emphasis was placed on histone modification relevance. A look in to the data obtained led to the definition of chromatin states based on histone modifications. The human genome was annotated with chromatin states. These annotated states can be used as new ways to annotate a genome independently of the underlying genome sequence. This independence from the DNA sequence enforces the epigenetic nature of histone modifications. Chromatin states are also useful in identifying regulatory elements that have no defined sequence, such as enhancers. This additional level of annotation allows for a deeper understanding of cell specific gene regulation. Methods The histone mark acetylation can be detected in a variety of ways: 1\\\\. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-sequencing) measures the amount of DNA enrichment once bound to a targeted protein and immunoprecipitated. It results in good optimization and is used in vivo to reveal DNA-protein binding occurring in cells. ChIP-Seq can be used to identify and quantify various DNA fragments for different histone modifications along a genomic region. 2\\\\. Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) is used to investigate regions that are bound by well positioned nucleosomes. Use of the micrococcal nuclease enzyme is employed to identify nucleosome positioning. Well positioned nucleosomes are seen to have enrichment of sequences. 3\\\\. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is used to look in to regions that are nucleosome free (open chromatin). It uses hyperactive Tn5 transposon to highlight nucleosome localisation. Clinical significance H4K5ac is implicated in inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease.

In 1498, he was appointed the singing master of and two years later became the chapel master of the Vienna Court Chapel. Besides the singing master, two bass players and six boys were employed. Under Emperor Ferdinand I most of the musicians of the Hofmusikkapelle were Flemish and under Ferdinand II most came from Italy. The court band flourished under the subsequent emperors until about 1740, after which Maria Theresa and Joseph II restricted its use to church music, and Antonio Salieri, who taught Beethoven, was the last Italian court conductor. After World War I and the fall of the monarchy, the court music band was placed under the Ministry of Education. Boys were no longer hired and ladies of the Vienna State Opera sang the upper parts, and the choir was disbanded in 1922. However it was formed again in 1924 as the Vienna Boys' Choir, and this has since become a professional music group.History from the Official web-site of the Choir Wiener Hofburgkapelle A chapel was built in Vienna in around 1287 by Albert I in the late Romanesque style. It was expanded under Albert II between 1423 and 1426, and rebuilt in Gothic style by Frederick III from 1447 to 1449. Later Maria Theresa arranged for it to be rebuilt in late Baroque style. It was in this building that the Hofkapelle performed, a tradition that has been continued. Today's Wiener Hofmusikkapelle consists of the Vienna Boys' Choir, male singers from the choir of the Vienna State Opera, and members of the Vienna Philharmonic. They regularly perform in church services at the Hofburgkapelle.  Bibliography * Wien.

It was Presbyterian, Church of Scotland. Located in Ross-Shire, Scottish Highlands. Originally known as 'An Eaglais Mhor' which means 'Big Church' but often also known locally as: East Kirk. It was built on virgin land of a shingle bank, very close to the edge of the salt water Loch Carron. Location: The building is situated a mile from the village of Lochcarron on the A896, on the North Coast 500 tourist route. The building and graveyard are situated within the Lochcarron Golf Course at the foot of the Glas Bheinn mountain 728m, which is connected to the Sgurr a' Gharaidh mountain 732m. The grey topped An Ruadh-stac 892m, is visible from the graveyard, but not it's taller neighbour red topped Maol Chean-dearg 933m. Also clearly visible from the graveyard to the east is Fuar Tholl 907m, with the Wellington's Nose landmark on its summit. These are part of the Torridon mountain group. Confusables: The building is not to be confused with the other Old Parish Church of 1751 that is several meters down the road towards the village, and is a ruin.. It is also not to be confused with Lochcarron Parish Church, which is the current Parish Church and located in the village. The building: The grade B listed building is sited in the new Lochcarron Burial Ground, an active graveyard (owned and maintained by the council), which contains the remains of Lauchlan Watt at the east end of the building (visible in the picture). There are no graves older than the church, those are sited in the graveyard of the 1751 Old Parish Church. The building has been remodelled inside three times since being built . The original layout was a central high pulpit with galleries either side. Later it was remodelled into two rooms, the galleries were removed and the pulpit remodelled. A large maintenance was undertaken by Alexander_Ross_(architect) which included adding skews. In the final remodelling a gallery was placed at the opposite end to the pulpit. Under the gallery are two vestry rooms, steps up to the gallery and a passageway to the porch. The entrance porch was an addition during the remodelling. This is a newer front door as the original access was through two doors either side of the pulpit, these were blocked up when two doors in the rear wall were added, one of these was blocked up when the new porch entrance was added. In fact, the blocked entrance door in the west rear wall was turned into a window. At some point the raised wooden floors were added, as before that it was a soil floor with boards over. Major alterations summary: 1\\\\. Initial design: one large room, galleries either side, high central pulpit with external doors either side of it. The 700 to 800 person capacity. 2\\\\. Two rooms, galleries removed, pulpit remodelled, doors near pulpit closed up, doors opened in rear wall at extreme ends. 3\\\\. Returned to a large room with a gallery installed, with vestry rooms under, at the opposite end to the pulpit. External door opened under gallery. Rear west door sealed. The building still contains a rare long central communion table (similar to the ones in Ardchattan Kirk near Oban and Howmore#Church in the Outer Hebrides, although the East Kirk table is a continuous table, without a break) and the remodelled pulpit and altar. The wooden floors are intact. It is 26 feet from the floor to the rafters. Though the building looks small from the outside, it is actually very large. In its heyday it was reported to be able to contain 700 to 800 people. In the 1930s it was quoted as, \\"One of the biggest enclosed spaces in the Highlands.\\" The four wooden Gothic Y-tracery windows to the front are three and a half meters tall and still original. The windows above the pulpit are also original. There is a very similar, though smaller, church in Applecross. This now has Y-tracery windows, though smaller windows than the East Kirk, which are uPVC; the original windows were not Y-tracery. While a lot of Highland churches follow a similar oblong box design pattern to the East Kirk, the unusual things about it are: the very large ornate Y-tracery windows and the exceptional size of the building. Other than that, in line with the Presbyterian faith, the interior is now modest. The glass is clear, and not stained glass, in order to 'let in the light of the lord'. The standard design and standard bellcote is featured on all the Thomas Telford 'Parliamentary Kirks', though East Kirk is 6 years too late a build to be among their number it still shares a similar design philosophy. History: The building is private hands since the Church of Scotland sold it in 2005. Previous to 2005 the building had been used for a long time for only funerals and looked after by the community. Its size counted against it, as the church divided several times after its being built, starting with the division between the Church of Scotland and the Free Church. The large kirk was no longer needed as other churches were built in the village. In addition to East Kirk and the old East Kirk, there are four more churches in Lochcarron, three currently active. The East Kirk was always notoriously hard to heat with 30 inch thick stone walls, and most remember it as a very cold building to be in. Hence, over its later life the building was rather neglected. It was owned by the Church of Scotland but looked after and insured by the community council. It was sold because the cost of insurance became a problem. From 2005 to 2018 it was left mostly untouched after that owner removed the pews, organ and plaster walls. All this was burnt. In 2018 it changed hands again and it now in a process of renovation. The current owners intend to restore it to original condition, although the roof has \\"nail sickness\\" and needs attention first.

He began his career with Platinum Stars in his native country South Africa, making his Premier Soccer League debut in March 2011. Visser was touted as one of the most exciting young prospects from South Africa for some time. Visser played for Bloemfontein Celtic, Black Leopards and Polokwane City and picked up a winners medal when Bloemfontein Celtic won the 2012 Telkom Knockout. He was the regular first-team goalkeeper at Santos during the 2016–17 season. Despite this, the club were relegated out of the National First Division. He returned to the top-flight with former club Platinum Stars the next season as the regular first-choice goalkeeper and remained as such when Platinum Stars was sold and renamed to Cape Umoya United. In June 2019, Visser decided to move to England and eventually signed a short-term deal at Exeter City. After the expiration of his deal he left the club to instead sign a short term deal with Crewe Alexandra in March 2020. He signed a deal with Port Vale five months later. Career South Africa Visser began his career with Platinum Stars, where head coach Steve Komphela described him and fellow youngster Allan Thomas as \\"good, up-and-coming young goalkeepers\\". In 2010, Visser featured for Platinum Stars in a friendly against England, as part of their preparations for the 2010 World Cup. Visser made his first-team debut under the stewardship of Owen Da Gama on 5 March 2011, keeping a clean sheet and the earning man of the match award in a 0–0 draw with SuperSport United at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in the Premier Soccer League, with regular custodian Tapuwa Kapini suspended. This would prove to be his only appearance for the \\"Dikwena\\" however as he refused to sign a new three-year deal with the club and instead chose to become a free agent in the summer. He moved on to Bloemfontein Celtic and was an unused substitute in the 2012 Telkom Knockout final, as Celtic beat Mamelodi Sundowns 3–0 at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. He was loaned out to National First Division side Black Leopards for the 2013–14 season. He played 16 games to help Kosta Papić's \\"Lidoda Duvha\\" to record a second-place finish, though they missed out on promotion as they went on to lose to Polokwane City in the play-offs; Visser entered the game as a 31st- minute replacement for Jacob Mokhasi, with the Leopards already two goals down, and his outstanding saves were too late to sway the game. Visser then signed with Polokwane City and started as first choice in head coach Boebie Solomons' plans for the 2014–15 season as Botswana international Modiri Marumo was waiting on a work permit. He only played 11 games for the club after falling out with the club ownership structure, who came out to deny rumours that he had been released midway through the 2015–16 season. Visser joined Santos in August 2016. He played 24 games during the 2016–17 season, though the \\"People's Team\\" would be relegated down to the SAFA Second Division in last place. He rejoined Platinum Stars in August 2017, signing a two-year deal, to compete with Mwenya Chibwe, Steven Hoffman and Mbongeni Mzimela for a place in Peter Butler's starting eleven. Stars finished second-bottom of the South African Premier Division and were relegated; Visser featured a total of 21 times, including playing in all the play-off matches. The Platinum Stars entity was sold and renamed Cape Umoya United, who were aiming for promotion under head coach Roger De Sá. He featured 24 times in the 2018–19 campaign, though the \\"Spirited Ones\\" could only manage a tenth-place finish. England Following the expiration of his Cape Umoya United contract at the end of the 2018–19 National First Division season, Visser moved to England. He went on trial with Charlton Athletic in July 2019, but ultimately the \\"Addicks\\" instead opted to sign Ben Amos. In October, he joined EFL League Two club Exeter City on a short-term deal, who were missing Lewis Ward with a broken arm. Visser made his debut for the club in a 3–1 victory over West Ham United U21 at St James Park in the group stage of the EFL Trophy. In the following round, Visser kept a clean sheet against League One promotion contenders Oxford United, incredibly saving all three of Oxford's penalties in the ensuing penalty shootout – a performance which earned him the tournament's 'Player of the Round' award. Following on from the expiration of Visser's short-term contract and a second injury to Jonny Maxted, Visser was offered the chance to return to the \\"Grecians\\" in February, however he rejected this, and the following month joined EFL League Two rivals Crewe Alexandra and promotion favourites on a short-term deal to the end of the 2019–20 season. He signed for League Two club Port Vale on 27 August 2020 after impressing manager John Askey on trial, who hoped he would challenge established number one Scott Brown for a first-team place. He made his debut against Tranmere Rovers at Vale Park on 8 September, keeping a clean sheet and then saving three penalties in the shoot-out to secure two points for the \\"Valiants\\" in the group stages of the EFL Trophy.

He was classically trained in piano, and spent his high school years dreaming of attending the Peabody Institute, however the conservatory turned down his application after hearing that Lawson aimed to become a studio musician. Lawson started composing songs when he was given his first keyboard, a Korg M1, and played piano in a cover band during high school. Lawson attended the Berklee College of Music where he majored in jazz performance, which was his first experience learning improvisation. While attending college, Lawson successfully worked as a studio musician, to the point where he did not see much of a reason to keep attending the school.

In 1997, Lawson formed the Chad Lawson Trio alongside drummer Al Sergel, and bassist Zack Page, and recorded their debut album as a Christmas present for his mother.

In 2009 after returning to the United States, Lawson released his debut solo album Set on a Hill, a primarily improvised jazz piano album produced by William Ackerman. The album was awarded the album of the year by Whisperings: Solo Piano Radio. After the release of the album, Lawson moved back to Charlotte after experiencing health problems. His sophomore album, The Piano (2011), was awarded the SoloPiano.com classical album of the year. Lawson's 2013 album The Space Between was mostly written in a single day, and songs from the album were widely broadcast through RTVE and Echoes. In 2014, Lawson released the album The Chopin Variations, a double album reinterpreting the works of Chopin (one side solo piano, one side collaborations with violinist Judy Kang and cellist Rubin Kodheli), which was widely successful, reaching number one on the Billboard Top Classical Albums chart. In 2015, Lawson collaborated with veteran electro producer Man Parrish on the album Beautiful. Lawson followed The Chopin Variations with a second classical re-imagining in 2016, this time of Bach's chorale works. From 2016, Lawson began acting as the composer for the podcast Lore, as well as the podcast's Prime Video adaptation. Lawson collaborated with Lore creator Aaron Mahnke again for the soundtracks of his podcast Unobscured, and the theme song for the podcast Cabinet of Curiosities.

He has been the general secretary of the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) since November 28, 2012.  Life  Youth Laurent Berger is the son of a worker of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique and of a child care assistant. During his studies, he was a supervisor in a high school. He joined the French Democratic Confederation of Labour at that time. After he earned a master's degree in history from Nantes University, he became a parmanent staff member of the Young Christian Workers (YCW) in 1991. He was the general secretary of the YCW from 1992 to 1994. He was subsequently unemployed for six months and was intermittently a substitute teacher of history and geography. He was employed by a social insertion association in Saint-Nazaire to help long-term unemployed adults and RMI beneficiaries to find jobs. There, he created a CFDT section and became the staff representative of this association of nine employees. Union action In 1996, Berger became a permanent staff member of the Saint-Nazaire CFDT local union. He worked on employment and youth issues within the trade union. In 2003, he was elected general secretary of the CFDT regional union of Pays de la Loire and joined the CFDT national office. On June 17, 2009, he was elected to the Confederal Executive Commission, the leading body of the CFDT, where he was in charge of small business files. After 2010, he was in charge of employment issues, securing career and integration paths. In this respect, he was the CFDT negotiator to state unemployment insurance and to youth employment. Berger was appointed as the deputy general secretary of CFDT on March 21, 2012. He was the head of a reflection on the functioning of the CFDT, aimed at bringing the union closer to employees. After François Chérèque's resignation, Berger was elected as the general secretary by the CFDT national office on November 28, 2012. He was re-elected with 98.31 percent of votes on March 5th, 2014 during a CFDT congress in Marseille. In 2016, Berger supported the Socialist government's labour law reform bill, in constrast with the FO and CGT unions. In June 2018, Berger was re-elected as the general secretary of the CFDT with more than 90 percent of votes. Under Berger's chairmanship, the CFDT became the largest trade union at union elections in the private sector (2017) but remained the second one at the elections in the Civil Service (2018). On December 11th, 2018, Berger tweeted that the CFDT had become the first trade union in France, overtaking the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Berger has been the chairman of the European Trade Union Confederation since May 2019. Opinion against the National Front In an interview with Francis Brochet for regional press group EBRA in the aftermath of the 2014 European Parliament election favourable towards the National Front, Laurent Berger stated: \\"For me, the National Front is always too high: this party (I am not talking about its voters) is a stain on democracy. We have the choice between an authoritarian society that will be into the 'We just have to' and look for a scapegoat, and a more appeased society of dialogue and listening. It is more complicated, but it will always be my choice.\\" In April 2017, during the 2017 French presidential election, Berger announced he had \\"clearly taken a stance against Marine Le Pen and published arguments for [CFDT's] militants\\", even if he did not give any voting instructions.

Tropper is a Professor of Physics at the University of Southampton. Her work considers solid-state and semiconductor lasers; specifically the development of ytterbium-doped silica fibre lasers and Vertical External- Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers. She was elected a Fellow of The Optical Society in 2006.  Early life and education  Tropper spent her childhood in her father's high-voltage laboratory. She eventually studied physics at the Somerville College, Oxford, where she was taught by Nina Byers. She was encouraged by Byers to stay at Oxford for a doctoral degree, and joined the laboratory of Mike Leask. After earning her PhD Tropper was awarded a Lindemann Fellowship, and joined an engineering consultancy before moving to the Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, California.  Research and career  Tropper joined the University of Southampton in 1983. Inspired by the work of David N. Payne Tropper became increasingly interested in laser physics. She worked alongside David Hanna on the development of ytterbium- doped silica fibres, and together demonstrated their potential in λ = 1µm optical amplifiers. These amplifiers allowed for high power operation as well as the broad spectra bandwidths required to amplify ultrashort optical pulses. In 1988 Tropper and Hanna were the first to show that ytterbium-doped silica fibres could be used as an optical gain medium, and went on to investigate the spectroscopic properties that underpin its performance. Tropper's early work on ytterbium-doped silica fibres went on to influence Gérard Mourou. In 1989 Trotter was a founding member of the University of Southampton Optoelectronics group. In 1997 Tropper worked with Ursula Keller on the first passively mode- locked Vertical External-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VECSEL). Tropper leads the VECSEL group at the University of Southampton and coordinates the annual SPIE conference on VECSELs. She was awarded a Personal Chair in 2000 and made Head of Department in 2002. She has investigated semiconductor lasers that emit femtosecond optical pulses. In 2006 Tropper was elected a Fellow of The Optical Society. Tropper was appointed to the Institute of Physics Council in 2017. She was one of 1,400 academics who signed a letter to The Sunday Times in support of Britain remaining in the European Union.

It was made after the UK lowered the recommended amount of alcohol for men to match women's at about the equivalent of seven pints of beer per week. It follows Javid Abdelmoneim as he explores the effects of alcohol on the body. The purpose of the documentary was to inform people about the realities of alcohol and its effects on the body as well as answer questions about why some people are more sensitive to alcohol, hangover remedies, the benefits of red wine, drinking on an empty stomach, effects of nightcaps on sleep, and other common questions.  Synopsis  According to the documentary, alcohol affects many different aspects. These include numbing pain and losing self-control. Besides drinking water to prevent dehydration, other possible solutions were explored in the documentary. The film stated that though red wine is better for you, there are other foods that can provide the same health benefits, and that lining stomach with food does help with alcohol tolerance. The documentary states that nightcaps help people fall asleep faster and result in deeper sleep the first half of the night, but can lead to more interrupted sleep for the second half of the night. It says that people believe that beer gets people less drunk, hangovers get worse with age, and that women get worse hangovers than men. This film claimed that in actuality none of these things are true. The limits changed from 21 to 14 units of alcohol per week spread out throughout the week for men in the UK—the equivalent of about seven pints of beer. One of the main reasons for the change in the recommended limit is how much cancer is related to alcohol consumption.  Reception  Sam Wollaston writes in The Guardian that the documentary is \\"insubstantial but addictive\\" and adds no new knowledge about alcohol. The BBC covered the documentary.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07czwhz  Crew  The director was David Briggs. The producers were Sam Anthony, David Briggs, and Phillip Smith.

He is of Jewish descent. Prior to his election, Levy had worked as a healthcare assistant on an inpatient mental health rehabilitation ward in St Nicholas Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne. After his election, he was accused of misleading the public after the Nursing Times reported he had made a series of social media posts during the campaign stating he had worked as a mental health nurse. The posts were later amended. Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust confirmed he had worked as a healthcare assistant. The term \\"nurse\\" is not legally protected so Levy's posts had not violated the Nurses Registration Act 1919.

It brings together twenty monasteries and the different villages and houses that depend on them. They house around 2,000 Eastern Orthodox Greek, Bulgarian, Romanian, Russian, Serbian and other monks who lead a life of seclusion, introspection and prayer, in a landscape on the mountain, sometimes called \\"Christian Tibet\\". The twenty monasteries are stavropegic, that is to say exempt: they escape the authority of the local bishop and are placed directly under the sole episcopal responsibility of the Ecumenical Patriarch. On the political and administrative level, it is the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs which manages, on behalf of the Hellenic Republic, questions relating to the peninsula, which is a Greek territory, but where different laws apply, compatible with the Abaton: this difference is constitutionally guaranteed. The icon of the Mother of God called Axion estin which usually sits behind the altar of the Protaton church of Karyès, as hegumene of all the Holy Mountain, is occasionally shown at big Greek cities where it receives honors comparable to those reserved by a head of state. Flag of the Greek Orthodox Church used by the Monastic Republic Since 1990, the Monastic Republic of Mount Athos has experienced a spiritual renewal thanks to a regular influx of young people, often graduates and from the former Soviet bloc, which dramatically increased the number of monks and novices. Initially, eleven monasteries followed the same rule of Saint Sabbas, common to Eastern Orthodox monasticism (cenobitic monasteries); in nine others the monks each formulated and followed their own rules (idiorrythmic monasteries). Between 1970 and 1990, all the monasteries finally adopted a cenobitic community system. The access of \\"any female creature\\" is strictly forbidden, so as not to tempt the monks; however, it is understood that this edict concerns only domestic vertebrate creatures, with two exceptions: cats to control rodents and hens for eggs to make egg tempera, the favored medium for icon painting, as well as for food. The territory of the Monastic Republic is contiguous to the Greek municipality of Stagira-Akanthos, from which it is separated by a fence of about nine kilometers long. The small village of Karyes is the administrative center and the seat of the synod: there, there are lay people in the service of the Republic.  Monastic life  The monasteries of Mount Athos have a history of opposing ecumenism, or movements towards reconciliation between the Orthodox Church of Constantinople and the Roman Catholic Church. The Esphigmenou monastery is particularly outspoken in this respect, having raised black flags to protest against the meeting of Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople and Pope Paul VI in 1972. Esphigmenou was subsequently expelled from the representative bodies of the Athonite Community. The conflict escalated in 2002 with Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople declaring the monks of Esphigmenou an illegal brotherhood and ordering their eviction; the monks refused to be evicted, and the Patriarch ordered a new brotherhood to replace them. After reaching a low point of just 1,145 mainly elderly monks in 1971, the monasteries have been undergoing a steady and sustained renewal. By the year 2000, the monastic population had reached 1,610, with all 20 monasteries and their associated sketes receiving an infusion of mainly young well- educated monks. In 2009, the population stood at nearly 2,000.Robert Draper, \\"Mount Athos\\" , National Geographic magazine, December 2009 Many younger monks possess university education and advanced skills that allow them to work on the cataloging and restoration of the Mountain's vast repository of manuscripts, vestments, icons, liturgical objects and other works of art, most of which remain unknown to the public because of their sheer volume. Projected to take several decades to complete, this restorative and archival work is well under way, funded by UNESCO and the EU, and aided by many academic institutions. The history of the modern revival of monastic life on Mount Athos and its entry into the technological world of the twenty-first century has been chronicled in Graham Speake's book, now in its second edition, Mount Athos. Renewal in Paradise.. In 2018, Mount Athos became an issue within the increasingly tense Greece-Russia relations. The Greek government denied entry to Russian clerics headed for the monastery, and the media reported allegations that the Russian government used the mountain as a base for intelligence operations. Relations were worsened in October after the Russian Orthodox Church banned its adherents from visiting sites controlled by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, which includes Mount Athos.  Administration and organization  According to the constitution of Greece,Article 105 of the Constitution of Greece – The regime of Mount Athos. Mount Athos (the \\"Monastic State of Agion Oros\\") is, \\"following ancient privilege\\", \\"a self-governed part of the Greek State, whose sovereignty thereon shall remain intact\\", and consists of 20 main monasteries which constitute the Sacred Community, and the capital town and administrative centre, Karyes, also home to a as the representative of the Greek state. The governor is an executive appointee. The status of the Holy Mountain and the jurisdiction of the Agiorite institutions were expressly described and ratified upon admission of Greece to the European Union (then the European Community). Diamonētērion from 1978 The Holy Mountain is under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I. Athos is governed by the \\"Sacred Community\\" (Ιερά Κοινότητα – Hiera Koinotēta) which consists of the representatives of the 20 Holy Monasteries, having as executive committee the four-membered \\"Sacred Administration\\" (Ιερά Επιστασία – Hiera Epistasia), with the Protos (Πρώτος) being its head, while the current Protos or more correctly \\"Protepistátēs\\" is the Elder Symeon Dionysiates. Civil authorities are represented by the , appointed by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose main duty is to supervise the function of the institutions and the public order. The current Civil Governor is Athanasios Martinos. In each of the 20 monasteries – which today all follow again the coenobitic system – the administration is in the hands of the Abbot (Ηγούμενος – Hēgoumenos) who is elected by the brotherhood for life. He is the lord and spiritual father of the monastery. The Convention of the brotherhood (Γεροντία) is the legislative body. All the other establishments (sketes, cells, huts, retreats, hermitages) are dependencies of some of the 20 monasteries and are assigned to the monks by a document called homologon (ομόλογον). All persons leading a monastic life thereon acquire Greek citizenship without further formalities, upon admission as novices or monks. Visits to the peninsula are possible for laymen, but they need a special permit known as a (), similar to a visa. Of the 20 monasteries located on the Holy Mountain, the brethren of 17 are predominantly ethnically Greek. Of the other three, brethren are drawn from monks of primarily other origins, who become Greek subjects. These are the Helandariou Monastery (Serbian), the Zografou Monastery (Bulgarian) and the Agiou Panteleimonos monastery (Russian). Among the sketes, most are predominantly ethnic Greek. However, two are Romanian, the coenobitic \\"Skētē Timiou Prodromou\\" (which belongs to the Megistis Lavras Monastery) and the idiorrhythmic \\"Skētē Agiou Dēmētriou tou Lakkou\\", also called \\"Lakkoskētē\\" (which belongs to the Agiou Pavlou monastery). Another one is Russian, \\"Skētē Bogoroditsa\\" (which belongs to the Agiou Panteleimonos monastery).  Modern times  = Politics = Axion Estin icon used at the Mount Athos. It usually sits behind the altar of the Protaton church of Karyès, as hegumene of all the Holy Mountain. Agiou Panteleimonos monastery, traditional home of Russian monks, was the main theater of the Imiaslavie dogmatic controversy during the early 20th century The self-governed region of the Holy Mountain, according to the Decree passed by the Holy Community on 3 October 1913 and according to the international treaties of London (1913), Bucharest (1913), Neuilly (1919), Sèvres (1920) and Lausanne (1923), is considered part of the Greek state. The Decree, \\"made in the presence of the Holy Icon of Axion Estin\\", stated that the Holy Community recognised the Kings of Greece as the lawful sovereigns and \\"successors on the Mountain\\" of the \\"Emperors who built\\" the monasteries and declared its territory as belonging to the then Kingdom of Greece. Political instability in Greece during the mid-20th century that affected Mount Athos included Nazi occupation from the Easter season of 1941 through late 1944, followed immediately by the Greek Civil War in a struggle where Communist efforts failed. The Battle of Greece was reported in Time magazine, \\"The Stukas swooped across the Aegean skies like dark, dreadful birds, but they dropped no bombs on the monks of Mount Athos\\". After the Nazi takeover of Greece, the Epistassia, Athos's four-member executive committee, formally asked Adolf Hitler to place the Autonomous Monastic State under his personal protection, and Hitler agreed. Mount Athos survived World War II nearly untouched, and for the remainder of the war, the monks of Mount Athos referred to Hitler as \\"High Protector of the Holy Mountain\\" (). Later a \\"Special Double Assembly\\" of the Holy Community in Karyes passed the constitutional charter of the Holy Mountain, which was ratified by the Greek Parliament. This regime originates from the \\"self-ruled monastic state\\" as stated on a chrysobull parchment signed and sealed by the Byzantine Emperor Ioannis Tzimisces in 972. This important document is preserved in the House of the Holy Administration in Karyes. The self-rule of the Holy Mountain was later reaffirmed by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1095.  Prohibition on entry for women  Sign at entrance to Mount Athos There is a prohibition on entry for women, called avaton (Άβατον) in Greek, to make living in celibacy easier for men who have chosen to do so.Mount Athos , an IFPA (Independent Film Production Associates Limited) – Cinevideo co-production in association with Channel 4 Television, London. 1985. Monks feel that the presence of women alters the social dynamics of the community and therefore slows their path towards spiritual enlightenment. The ban was officially proclaimed by several emperors, including Constantine Monomachos, in a chrysobull of 1046. In the 14th century, Serbian Emperor Dušan the Mighty brought his wife, Helena of Bulgaria, to Mount Athos to protect her from the plague, but she did not touch the ground during her entire visit, as she was carried in a hand carriage all the time. French writer Maryse Choisy entered Mount Athos in the 1920s disguised as a sailor, and later wrote about her escapade in Un mois chez les hommes (\\"A Month with Men\\"). There was an incident in the 1930s regarding Aliki Diplarakou, the first Greek beauty pageant contestant to win the Miss Europe title, who made headlines when she dressed up as a man and snuck into Mount Athos. Her escapade was discussed in a 13 July 1953 Time magazine article entitled \\"The Climax of Sin\\".The Climax of Sin , Time Magazine, 1953 In 1953, Cora Miller, an American Fulbright Program teacher from Athens, Ohio, landed briefly along with two other women, stirring up a controversy among the local monks. A 2003 resolution of the European Parliament requested the lifting of the ban for violating \\"the universally recognised principle of gender equality\\". On 26 May 2008, five Moldovans illegally entered Greece by way of Turkey, ending up on Athos; four of the migrants were women. The monks forgave them for trespassing and informed them that the area was forbidden to females. Female domestic animals such as cows or sheep are also barred, except for female cats.  Status in the European Union  As part of an EU member state, Mount Athos is part of the European Union and, for the most part, subject to EU law. While outside the EU's Value Added Tax area, Mount Athos is part of the Schengen Area.The Greek not accession treaty does not specifically exclude Mount Athos from the Convention's territorial scope. A declaration attached to Greece's accession treaty to the Schengen Agreement states that Mount Athos's \\"special status\\" should be taken into account in the application of the Schengen rules.Joint Declaration No. 5 attached to the Final Act of the not accession treaty. The monks strongly objected to Greece joining the Schengen Area based on fears that the EU would be able to end the centuries- old prohibition on the admittance of women. The prohibition is unchanged and a special permit is required to enter the peninsula. The monks were also concerned that the agreement could affect their traditional right to offer sanctuary to people from Orthodox countries such as Russia. Such monks do nowadays need a Greek visa and permission to stay, even if that is given generously by the Greek ministry, based on requests from Athos.Greece (Center for International Economic Cooperation)  Languages  Greek is commonly used in all the Greek monasteries, but in some monasteries there are other languages in use: in Agiou Panteleimonos, Russian (67 monks in 2011); in Helandariou Monastery, Serbian (58); in Zographou Monastery and Skiti Bogoroditsa, Bulgarian (32); and in the sketes of Timiou Prodromou and Lakkoskiti, Romanian (64). Today, many of the Greek monks also speak foreign languages. Since there are monks from many nations in Athos, they naturally also speak their own native languages.  Monastic life: monasteries, sketae, and cells  Today the 20 monasteries of Mount Athos are the dominant holy institutions for both spiritual and administrative purposes, consolidated by the Constitutional Chart of the Holy Mountain. Although, since the beginning of Mount Athos' history, monks were living in lodgings of different size and construction quality. All these monastic lodging types exist until today, named as seats (καθίσματα), cells (κελλιά), huts (καλύβες), retreats (ησυχαστήρια), hermitages (ερημιτήρια), caves (σπήλαια), sketai (σκήτες) and all of them are known under the general term \\"dependencies\\" (εξαρτήματα) of the Holy Monasteries. The term \\"cells\\" can be used under a more generalised meaning, comprising all the above but sketae, and following this term we can talk about three different kind of institutions in Mount Athos: monasteries, sketae and cells.  Monasteries  A map of Mount Athos with the monasteries indicated A pilgrim/visitor to a monastery, who is accommodated in the guest-house (αρχονταρίκι) can have a taste of the monastic life in it by following its daily schedule: praying (services in church or in private), common dining, working (according to the duties of each monk) and rest. During religious celebrations usually long vigils are held and the entire daily program is radically reshaped. The gate of the monastery closes by sunset and opens again by sunrise.  Cells  A cell is a house with a small church, where 1–3 monks live under the spiritual and administrative supervision of a monastery. Monastic life in the cells is totally different from that in a monastery. Some of the cells resemble tidy farmhouses, others are poor huts, others have the gentility of Byzantine tradition or of Russian architecture of the past century. Usually, each cell possesses a piece of land for agricultural or other use. Each cell has to organize some activities for income. Besides the traditional occupations (agriculture, fishing, woodcarving, spirit distillation, iconography, tailoring, book binding etc.) new occupations have been taken up, for example taxi driving, couriers, car repairing and computer services. The monk(s) living in a cell, having to take care of all daily chores, make up their own schedules. For the pilgrim/visitor it is worth experiencing this side of monastic life as well, but most of the cells have very limited or no capacity for hospitality.  Sketes  A view of Nea Skiti. Small communities of neighbouring cells were developed since the beginning of monastic life on Mount Athos and some of them were using the word \\"skete\\" (σκήτη) meaning \\"monastic settlement\\" or \\"lavra\\" (λαύρα) meaning \\"monastic congregation\\". The word \\"skete\\" is of Coptic origin and in its original form is a placename of a location in the Egyptian desert.Variant names: Skiathis – Sketis – Skithis – Skitis – Skete – Oros Nitrias (Nitria) – Wadi el-Natrun – sites including Deir el-Surian (Deir el-Syriani), the monastery of Maria Deipara, Kellia, the monastery Deir Abu Maqar, Qaret el- Dahr, Quçur el-Rubaiyat according to the on-line dictionary \\"Trismegistos\\" It is in the Egyptian desert where monasticism made its first steps. The unknown author of the \\"History of the Egyptian Monks\\" (Historia Monachorum in Aegypto), perhaps Flavius Rufinus, visited the area at the end of the fourth century. He tells us: \\"Then we came to Nitria, the best-known of all monasteries of Egypt, about forty miles [60 km] from Alexandria; it takes its name from a nearby town where Nitre is collected... In this place there are about fifty dwellings, or not many less, set near together and under one father. In some of them, there are many living together, in others a few and in some there are brothers who live alone. Though they are divided by their dwellings they remain bound together and inseparable in faith and love\\". This is exactly the main idea of a \\"skete\\", the communal way, just between the eremitic way and the coenobitic way of monasticism, with all 3 coexisting until today. In 1680 the ex-patriarch Dionysios III Vardalis built in the Saint Anne skete of the Holy Mountain a big central church to accommodate all the monks of the area and in 1689 an internal regulatory text was constituted by the monks and ratified first by the Monastery of Megisti Lavra and finally by the patriarch Dionysios V Haritonidis; and later again by patriarch Cyril V, who contributed in its evolution. Since then, more sketes followed on the same way, and gradually the term \\"skete\\" (within the Holy Mountain) came to be used only for the monastic settlements having an internal rule ratified by the Patriarchate. Later on, some cells came to attract many monks, expanded their buildings and started functioning in the coenobitic way of the monasteries. Since the number of the Monasteries in Mount Athos was restricted to 20, a new term was introduced: the coenobitic skete (κοινόβιος σκήτη), while a skete of the traditional form was named idiorhythmic skete (ιδιόρρυθμος σκήτη) in order to underline the difference. The first ones, both in architecture and lifestyle, follow the typical model of a monastery, that of a community living together, sharing and distributing work, and praying together daily. In contrast, the idiorrhythmic community (intermediary between the coenobitic community and the seclusion of a hermit) resembles a hamlet, and the daily life there is much like that of a cell. But there are also some duties for the community. Near the centre of the settlement is the central church called Kyriakon (Κυριακόν, that could be translated \\"for Sunday\\"), where the whole brotherhood meets for the Divine Liturgy service, on Sundays and on greater feasts. Usually there are also an administration house, a refectory for common celebrations, a cemetery, a library, storehouses and a guesthouse.  Culture and life in the Athonite Republic   Art and literary treasures  Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan, Stavronikita monastery. A decorated wall of the Catholicon, Vatopedi monastery. A fresco with Saint Mercurius and Artemius of Antioch. The Athonite monasteries possess huge deposits of invaluable medieval art treasures, including icons, liturgical vestments and objects (crosses, chalices), codices and other Christian texts, imperial chrysobulls, holy relics etc. However the monks consider them for their religious function only, not as \\"treasures\\" and most are in regular use for their original purpose. Until recently no organized study and archiving had been carried out, but an EU-funded effort to catalogue, protect and restore them is underway since the late 1980s. Their sheer number is such, it is estimated that several decades will pass before the work is completed. Among the most ancient and priceless codices at Mount Athos are the Codex Athous Lavrensis and the Codex Athous Dionysiou.  Date and time reckoning  The Julian calendar, which currently has a difference of 13 days from the Gregorian calendar, is still used on Mount Athos. In 1923, as a means to eliminate the divergence existing between the religious and civil dates, after a synod in Constantinople, part of the Eastern Orthodox Churches dropped 13 days and adopted the Revised Julian calendar, which is synchronised with the Gregorian calendar, at least until 2800.However, the Easter date, based on the lunar cycle, is still calculated following the original Julian calendar, making the Eastern Orthodox world celebrate Easter on the same day. Although under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the spiritual head of the monastic state, nearly all the monasteries of Athos refused to follow the revised calendar and finally, for the sake of uniformity, the patriarch asked the single monastery that used the revised calendar to revert to the Julian. Also in use is Byzantine time, in which the day commences at sunset as does the liturgical dayIn accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5). and not at midnight as in the reckoning of civil time, and the difference between the two varies according to the season of the year. Because the time interval from sundown to sundown is not constant, clocks showing the Byzantine time require continual manual readjusting which in current practice is done weekly, on Saturday, if the sky is clear; where the summit of Athos is visible, 12:00 is set when the last rays of sunlight cease to shine on the tip. Some monasteries also have a clock showing civil time since boat schedules run thereon (and on the civil calendar) as well as for pilgrims who may be disoriented by Byzantine time reckoning.

There are two kinds of sketes in Mount Athos. A coenobitic skete follows the style of monasteries. An idiorrhythmic skete follows the style of a small village: it has a common area of worship (a church), with individual hermitages or small houses around it, each one for a small number of occupants. There are twelve official sketes on Mount Athos. {  !Skiti / Σκήτη !Type !Monastery !Alternative names / notes - Agias Annas Αγίας Άννας Idiorrhythmic Megistis Lavras (= Saint Anne) Agiánna - Agias Triados or Kafsokalyvíon Αγίας Τριάδος ή Καυσοκαλυβίων Idiorrhythmic Megistis Lavras (= Holy Trinity) Kafsokalývia (=\\"burned huts\\") - Timiou Prodromou Τιμίου Προδρόμου Coenobitic Megistis Lavras (= Holy Fore-runner, i.e. St John the Baptist) Prodromu, Sfântul Ioan Botezătorul – Romanian - Agiou Andrea Αγίου Ανδρέα Coenobitic Vatopediou (= Saint Andrew) Also known as Saray (Σαράι) - Agiou Dimitriou Αγίου Δημητρίου Idiorrhythmic Vatopediou (= Saint Demetre) Vatopediní - Timiou Prodromou Iviron Τιμίου Προδρόμου Ιβήρων Idiorrhythmic Iviron (= Holy Forerunner, i.e. St John the Baptist) Ivirítiki - Agiou Panteleimonos Αγίου Παντελεήμονος Idiorrhythmic Koutloumousiou (= Saint Panteleimon/Pantaleon) Koutloumousianí - Profiti Ilia Προφήτη Ηλία Coenobitic Pantokratoros (= Prophet Elijah) - Theotokou or Nea Skiti Θεοτόκου ή Νέα Σκήτη Idiorrhythmic Agiou Pavlou (=Of God-Bearer or New Skete) - Agiou Dimitriou tou Lakkou or Lakkoskiti Αγίου Δημητρίου του Λάκκου ή Λακκοσκήτη Idiorrhythmic Agiou Pavlou (= Saint Demetre of the Ravine or Ravine-Skete) Lacu, Sfântul Dumitru – Romanian - Evangelismou tis Theotokou Ευαγγελισμού της Θεοτόκου Idiorrhythmic Xenophontos (= Annunciation of Theotokos) Xenofontiní - Bogoroditsa Βογορόδιτσα Coenobitic Agiou Panteleimonos (= Theotokos, God- Bearer) Богородица – Bulgarian }  Main settlements  * Karyes * Dafni  Friends organization  The Friends of Mount Athos (FoMA) is a society formed in 1990 by people who shared a common interest for the monasteries of Mount Athos, and a registered charity in the U.K. (Registered Charity No. 1047287). Timothy Ware, Metropolitan Kallistos of Diokleia, is the President of the society. Among its members are Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Charles, Prince of Wales, Heir Apparent to the British throne, who is the royal patron of the society. Although founded in the U.K., the society has an extensive international membership, including a large membership in the Americas. The objective of the society, as stated on its official web page, is described as: \\"the advancement of education of the public in the study and knowledge of the history, culture, arts, architecture, natural history, and literature of the Orthodox monasteries of Mount Athos and the promotion of the religious and other charitable work of the Holy Community and monasteries of Mount Athos.\\" To that end, the society works to advance education by studying and providing information on the history, culture, arts, architecture, natural history, and literature of Mount Athos. To achieve this, it produces publications, arranges lectures, and organizes conferences and exhibitions devoted to Athonite themes. The society also supports and promotes the religious and other charitable work of the monasteries and their dependencies as well as other religious communities with links to the Holy Mountain. FoMA acts as a group of concerned friends and supporters, providing assistance where possible, in consultation with the monastic authorities. Appeals may be launched from time to time if funds are needed for specific purposes, but the assistance mainly takes the form of expertise, liaison, or equipment needed by the monks. The society's American membership founded in 2017 a parallel charitable foundation, The Mount Athos Foundation of America. As a service to the monasteries and to pilgrims, the society clears and maintains the ancient footpaths of Mount Athos, many of the stone-paved (Kalderimi) paths dating back to the Byzantine era. It also provides on its website detailed footpath descriptions with GPS tracks, and a regularly updated report on the condition of the paths. FoMA member and cartographer, Peter Howorth of Christchurch, New Zealand, working with the society's footpath team, has recently published a new Pilgrim Map The Friends of Mount Athos, announcement of the Pilgrim Map, with link to the cartographer's website, . which incorporates modern mapping technology with study of early maps of Mount Athos. Among the society's publications are its annual bulletin (Friends of Mount Athos Annual Report) offering articles, book reviews and other features related to Mount Athos. Past issues are available from the society's web site. It also publishes A Pilgrim's Guide to Mount Athos in both printed and continuously updated digital forms, The Friends of Mount Athos, A Pilgrim's Guide to Mount Athos, online version. as well as a yearly directory of members.

It was first described to science by Johan Hjalmar Théel in 1886 reporting on the sea cucumber specimens brought back by the Challenger expedition. Among these was the type specimen for this species, which was collected at Bering Island.  Description  Cucumaria vegae with tentacles retracted. Note the rows of tube feet running the length of the body As one might expect, the tiny black sea cucumber is small, growing to a length of . It is black above and a somewhat lighter gray on its underside. When feeding, the animal extends eight equally long, finely branched, or dendritic, tentacles, and two shorter ones. These shorter tentacles are on the animal's ventral, or bottom side. When disturbed it retracts these delicate structures into its body. There are five double rows of podia, or tube feet that run the length of the body. Those or the dorsal, upper, side of the sea cucumber are less distinct. Like the tentacles, the tube feet retract when the animal is disturbed. Although the animal is highly flexible, it has calcareous plates, ossicles, embedded in its skin. When examined under a microscope, these ossicles appear generally rod-shaped with a number of small round holes.  Distribution  Tiny black sea cucumbers are found in the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan to the Russian Far East, the Commander Islands, the Aleutians, and south along the North American coast to Haida Gwaii in British Columbia. This is a shallow water species living on rocky bottoms in the intertidal zone, often in association with mussel beds.  Life history  This animal uses its tentacles to strain bits of organic matter from the sea. The tentacles have a coating of mucus which causes suspended particles to stick. The sea cucumber periodically retracts its tentacles, consuming the material stuck to them. Its close association with mussel beds, including those of Mytillus californianus, suggests that feces from these bivalves may form an important part of its diet. Tiny black sea cucumbers are gonochoric, which is to say that individuals are either male or female. Females retain their orange egg masses trapping them between their ventral side and the sea bottom. These are fertilized by nearby males that release their sperm into the sea. The skin of the females in contact with the egg mass is highly vascularized, suggesting that the adult provides nutrients to the developing young. Females brood their young during the late winter. Tiny black sea cucumbers are parasitized by the Colombian cucumber sucker snail, Vitreolina columbiana'. These tiny snails attach themselves to C. vegae and suck the fluids out of them. While this species is numerous it is so small that there is no commercial fishery.  Taxonomy  Externally, Cucumaria vegae is all but identical to another species of sea cucumber, Cucumaria pseudocurata. This latter species extends from the southernmost range of the tiny black sea cucumber in British Columbia to Southern California. Detailed examination of the bony plates in the skin, the ossicles, suggests a gradual change over the geographic range of the two species, rather than a sharp difference at the boundary between the two. Similarly, comparisons of mitochondrial DNA show only modest differences between the two species. It may be that C. vegae and C. pseuocurata, are in fact the same species.

During Henry's first year of membership, he aided Robert Jenrick in his campaign to win the 2014 Newark by- election.https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.darrenhenry.org.uk/campaigns/robert- jenrick-newark-election After a few months of membership, he sought nomination to be the official Conservative seat in North West Hampshire. He was shortlisted, but lost to former Deputy Mayor of London, Kit Malthouse. In the 2015 general election he was selected as the Conservative candidate for Wolverhampton North East in Birmingham., whilst also employed as General Manager at Harvest Fine Foods. He came second to Labour's Emma Reynolds, seeing a decline of 4.4% in the Conservative vote share. Henry served as a Parish councillor in Shrewton, Wiltshire before resigning in September 2019. Henry was also a Wiltshire Unitary Councillor from May 2017 until January 2020. As Henry assumed office as Member of Parliament for Broxtowe on 12 December 2019, this meant that Henry briefly had a dual mandate for both Wiltshire and Broxtowe. In early 2019, Henry was shortlisted to be Police and Crime Commissioner for Swindon and Wiltshire. He lost the selection to Jonathon Seed in April 2019. The May 2020 Police and Crime Commissioner election has since been postponed until 2021. In summer 2019, he was shortlisted, along with Tony Devenish and Felicity Buchan, for the ultra- marginal West London seat of Kensington. He failed to be selected. Following this, he was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Broxtowe in September 2019. At a 2019 general election hustings in Broxtowe, Henry called for a ban on payday loans, and for support for food bank users who could not manage their budgets properly. Reaction to this speech was audibly negative. During the election, Mr Henry leveraged an existing relationship with Mr Robert Jenrick to have Mr Jenrick commit to funding Stapleford (a ward within Broxtowe) with £25 million, but only if Mr Henry won the seat and the Conservative party won a majority. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/robert- jenrick-ignored-civil-servants-to-spend-towns-fund-millions-on-tory- marginals-9l50g32t8 In his maiden speech made on 25th June 2020 , which is also in the week marking 72 years since the arrival of the Windrush generation to the UK, Henry spoke negatively of Labour for its representation of immigrants and those of the Windrush Generation.

The son of writer and property developer Rayne Kruger and restaurateur and television presenter Prue Leith, Kruger was educated at Eton College and subsequently studied history at the University of Edinburgh and University of Oxford. After university, he worked at the think tank, Centre for Policy Studies, and then became a policy adviser for the Conservative Party. Kruger became David Cameron's chief speechwriter in 2006. He left this role two years later to work full-time at a youth crime prevention charity that he had co-founded called Only Connect. For his charitable work, Kruger received an MBE in 2017. In August 2019, he became Prime Minister Boris Johnson's political secretary. Early life and career Kruger was born in Westminster to South African parents, writer and property developer Rayne Kruger, and restaurateur and television presenter Prue Leith. He was privately educated at Eton College. Kruger studied history at the University of Edinburgh. While at the university, he was the editor of the magazine Intercourse, which had a controversial issue featuring three naked students and an advertisement for a massage parlour. He obtained a doctorate in history from the University of Oxford in 2000. After university, he became the director of research at the centre-right think tank Centre for Policy Studies in 2001. Kruger worked as a policy adviser in the Conservative Party's Policy Unit from 2003 to 2005. During this time, he was credited with contributing to then Conservative Party Leader Iain Duncan Smith's speech at the 2003 Conservative Party Conference. In 2005, Kruger became the chief leader writer of The Daily Telegraph. Kruger was selected as the Conservative candidate for Sedgefield in the 2005 general election. He was forced to drop out of the contest after The Guardian quoted him stating the party had planned \\"to introduce a period of creative destruction in the public services\\". Kruger left his position at The Daily Telegraph to become the chief speechwriter to then Conservative Party Leader David Cameron in 2006. He wrote Cameron's 2006 address to the think-tank Centre for Social Justice, which was later dubbed the \\"hug-a-hoodie\\" speech, and was noted as a call to re-brand the party with compassionate conservatism at its core. He co-founded the London-based youth crime prevention charity, Only Connect, in 2006 and in 2008 left his position as Cameron's chief speechwriter to work full-time for the charity. In 2015, the charity was acquired by Catch22 but continued to operate independently with its own brand. He also founded the charity West London Zone, which aims to provide support to at-risk youth. Kruger was made an MBE for services to charity in the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours. In the same year, he voiced his support for the legalisation of cannabis. Kruger supported Brexit in the 2016 UK EU membership referendum. He was a senior fellow at the pro-Brexit think- tank Legatum Institute, which he left in 2018 to become an adviser at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. In August 2019, Kruger became the political secretary to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Parliamentary career Kruger was selected as the Conservative candidate for Devizes on 9 November 2019. The constituency's incumbent Conservative MP, Claire Perry O'Neill, had previously announced that she would be standing down at the next election to become the president of the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and spend more time with her family; she was later fired from that role by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 31 January 2020 for unspecified reasons. Kruger was elected as MP for Devizes in the 2019 general election, with a majority of 23,993 (47.1%). He made his maiden speech on 29 January 2020, in which he called for a return to Christian values. In May 2020 he tweeted extensively in support of the apparent breach of lockdown by Dominic Cummings and Mary Wakefield, describing them as \\"old friends\\". Kruger wrote an article for the political website ConservativeHome in July in which he outlined his opposition to reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 which could allow trans people to change their legal gender by self-identification. In August 2020 he was photographed breaching the rules on the mandatory wearing of masks on public transport. He apologised, but also criticised the photographer for not asking him to put on a mask.

During her career, she was known as Lara Obidenna (occasionally spelled Obydennaya), though after ending her performance career, she began using her married name, Illaria Ladré.  Early life and career  Obidenna was born on November 26, 1906 in St. Petersburg in pre-revolutionary Russia. After the revolution, she began her training in the Imperial Theatre School also known as the Maryinsky School, where she was part of Agrippina Vaganova’s first class. In 1923, Obidenna moved to Paris and danced with various troupes. She married Marian Ladré, a fellow ballet dancer in 1926, becoming Illaria Ladré, though she kept her stage name, Lara Obidenna, during her career. She eventually joined the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1927 along with her husband. Obidenna danced with the company until Diaghilev’s death in 1929, at which point, she, her husband, and a few others persuaded René Blum and Colonel Wassily de Basil to start the Ballet Russe. When there became a rift between the two and they went their separate ways, Obidenna stayed with Colonel de Basil and his Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, which went through a few company name changes after they lost the rights to the name including Ballets Russes du Colonel W. de Basil (De Monte Carlo) and the Original Ballet Russe, among others. She danced with them from the establishment of the company in 1932 until 1946, though she did continue performing through 1947. The company's first performance was on January 17, 1932 in Monte Carlo. Obidenna danced mainly corps de ballet roles, but she also occasionally performed as a soloist for character roles. As one of the more experienced dancers, she would teach the symphonic ballets to younger dancers and generally oversaw classes and rehearsals, especially when necessary during tours. The company went to New York on tour in 1934 and was scheduled to return to the United States after the summer of 1936. However, due to good prospects in Australia, de Basil split the troupe in two. The main company went to New York, and the rest merged with the ballet company of Léon Woizikovsky and went to Australia, dancing under the name “The Monte-Carlo Russian Ballet”. Obidenna and her husband were in the main company, which proceeded to have a London season in Covent Garden before finally joining the rest of the company in Australia for their second and third tours as the Covent Garden Russian Ballet and the Original Ballet Russe respectively. During her time with de Basil’s company, Obidenna performed in numerous works, including Carnaval (Valse Noble), Scuola di ballo (Lucrèzia), La boutique fantasque (American’s Wife), La concurrence (Second Couple), Les femmes de bonne humeur (Silvestra), Petrouchka [Petrushka] (Chief Nursemaid), Choreartium, Le Tricorne, Prince Igor (Polovtsian Women), Scheherezade (Sultan's Women), Les Presages (Temptation, Destinies, Variation), Le Coq d'Or, The Blue Danube (Dressmakers), Le Mariage d’Aurore (Polonaise, Scene and Dance of the Duchesses), The malon (Rosario's Mother), and Les Sylphides (Nocturne), . The dancers in the company also performed in a number of operas, and between January 23 and April 8, 1930, while in Monte Carlo, she performed in such operas as: Madame Butterfly, Mefistofole, Walkiere, Rigoletto, Barbiere de Seviglia, Die Agyptische, Hélène, La Bohème, Quo Vadis, Turandot, La Damnation de Faust, Carmen, Boris Goudenov, Eine Nacht in Venedig, Tosca, Satan—Faust, and Don Quichotte.  Tours with de Basil  On the whole, de Basil's company maintained a repertory of over 100 ballets, had 40 world premiers, and appeared in 26 operas. In total, they gave over 4,000 performances in 600 cities in 70 countries around the globe. Illaria traveled with the company a great deal, including performing in the following countries (London is not listed as the company performed in Covent Garden every year during the summer season): 1932 - Principality of Monaco (the company's first performance) 1935 - United States (the company's first performance in the United States was in October at The Metropolitan Opera) 1936-1937 - United States 1937-1938 - United States 1938-1939 - Australia 1939 - New Zealand 1939-1940 - Australia 1940-1941 - United States 1941 - Cuba 1941 - Canada 1942 - Mexico 1943 - Argentina 1945 - Ecuador 1945 - Guatemala 1946 - Mexico 1946 - Brazil 1946 - Cuba  Later life and teaching career  After she stopped performing, Obidenna taught for a little while in New York. Then, in 1948, she and her husband moved to Seattle, where they opened the Ballet Academy and taught for the rest of their lives. Obidenna also went on to stage ballets such as The Nutcracker for various companies. Later, in 1988, a Bellingham dance teacher named Nancy Whyte helped Obidenna compile and self-publish her memoirs of her life in a book titled Illaria Obidenna Ladré: memoirs of a child of Theatre Street: an autobiography. The two had previously collaborated in 1985 to work on the choreography of and produce The Nutcracker in Bellingham (which became a yearly show) as part of Whyte’s desire to study classical repertory with Obidenna. During her time on the stage, Obidenna danced with George Balanchine in New York, and in 1988, she reconstructed his 1932 dance, Cotillon, for The Joffrey Ballet. Illaria Obidenna Ladré died of a stroke on May 24, 1998 at the age of 91.

Biography  He was born in 1660 in Kotor in Montenegro.He left information about his ancestors in the inscription on the icon of the Assumption of the Virgin in Morača. At the end of the seventies of the seventeenth century, he studied under the tutelage of Zograf Radul, with whom he painted the Church of the Holy Trinity (one of the six churches)in the Praskvica Monastery in 1680.Around 1680 he settled in Risan, a decade before the Great Migration. He had a daughter and four sons - Gabriel, Daniel, George, and Raphael -- who followed his footsteps. He was a contemporary of Tripo Kokolja.  Artistic work  Dimitrije painted several churches, including St. George in Sisici in 1699, St. Petka in Mrkovima in 1704, St. Nicholas in Pelinovo in 1718, and he is also credited with frescoes in the now-demolished church of St. Mina in Preradi. He also left behind a considerable number of iconic works such as four icons from 1680 -- Deesis, Our Lady of Christ and the Archangels, St. Nicholas, St. George and St. John the Forerunner of All Serbian Saints -- in the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Risan, two lintels with representations of the Nedremanj Eye and the Hospitality of Abraham in the church of St. Luke in Kotor in 1688, iconostasis in St. George in Sisici in 1690, and during 1716. He painted about 35 icons for the iconostasis in the village of Pelinovo in Grbalj, Montenegro, which was not preserved. In Morača monastery he painted the icons Saint Luke painting the Virgin, now in the Collection of Icons Sekulić in Belgrade, the use of John the Forerunner in the National Museum in Belgrade, both from the end of the seventeenth century and the Assumption of the Virgin with scenes related to the Virgin in 1713. To his hand, with more or less certainty, are the icons from the iconostasis in Mrkovima around 1703, the icon of Avram's Hospitality from Praskvica from 1714, the design act from the National Museum in Belgrade, as well as iconic works in the Savina, Piva, and Krka monasteries and the Church of St. George in Srpska, near Podgorica. Dimitrije accepted most of his iconographic and stylistic choices from his teacher Zograf Radul and from Zograf Jovan. He inherited compositional and color solutions, figure processing and the organization of space, but is distinguished from the works of older masters by a more pronounced schematization of forms, a more refined and less noble color selection, and coarser processing. Some of Dimitrije's works also feature some of the less frequently presented iconographic themes, such as certain scenes in the extensive cycles of Saint Petka in Mrkovima and St. Nicholas in Pelinovo, an extensive cycle of the church calendar on the frescoes in Pelinovo, compositions by the Virgin Mary the Living East and the Virgin Mary's Cover on the icon of the Assumption of the Virgin in the Morača Monastery.

The by-election was triggered by the death of Australian Labor Party MP Thomas Thrower, who had died only three months after being re-elected at the 1917 state election. Labor preselected as their candidate Patrick McGirr, a member of the Parkes Land Board and the brother of Greg McGirr, the state member for Yass. McGirr was selected overwhelmingly from a broad field that included Iron Trades Federation secretary E. M. Davies, Amalgamated Railway and Tramway Association assistant secretary R. Corish, radical Sydney Wharf Laborers' Union president William McCristal and unsuccessful federal or state election candidates T. Lavelle, I. A. Vitnell, Tom Brown and W. J. Boston. The preselection process for the new conservative Nationalist Party was somewhat chaotic, with different meetings of local interests and organisations that had come together to form the new party recommending different candidates to the state executive. The eventual executive decision largely came down to two candidates: Wellington miller Murdoch McLeod and Dubbo businessman H. T. Blackett, but also saw some support for former federal MP Ernest Carr, who had lost his seat at that year's election, with McLeod ultimately endorsed as the candidate. A third candidate, former federal MP Frank Foster, is often recorded as having contested as an independent or \\"Independent Nationalist\\", but campaigned for his own new minor party, the Australian Producers Co- Operative Party. Foster had been a Labor MP until losing his seat in 1913 and had left the party in the 1916 Labor split, but had not joined the Nationalist Party and had instead sought to form his own party taking a middle position between the two parties. McGirr won the by-election, finishing 239 votes ahead of McLeod with Foster a distant third, an increase on the Labor majority from the general election. McGirr was reported to have polled well in the larger centres while McLeod had performed better in the rural booths. The pro-Labor National Advocate newspaper in Bathurst described the result as a \\"magnificent success\\" that showed that the party was recovering from \\"the defection of the renegades\\" in the 1916 party split; they also noted that the result in the usually marginal seat was \\"the greatest for over nine years\\" and suggested the margin would have been larger had it not been for Foster's candidacy. The more conservative Evening News in Sydney downplayed the result, stating \\"the two parties simply maintained their respective positions: no advantage has been gained by either side\\", but drew attention to the Nationalist failure to win the seat despite dedicating tremendous resources, stating \\"the eloquence of nearly every Minister in the New South Wales Government was released upon the electors of Macquarie, but it fell short of success. This needs some explanation.\\" Dates {  - ! Date !

She was the first Conservative to represent the Wrexham constituency since its creation in 1918. In addition, she was the first female MP elected to represent the constituency and became the first female Conservative MP elected to Westminster representing a Welsh constituency.  Early life and career  After leaving her local comprehensive school at 16, Atherton joined the army serving in the Intelligence Corps before becoming a nurse, training at Bangor University, later becoming a social worker. In addition she ran her own business, a micro brewery, based on Wrexham Industrial Estate. Prior to being elected as the Member of Parliament for Wrexham she served on the Gresford Community Council.  Parliamentary career  Sarah Atherton was elected as the Member of Parliament for Wrexham in 2019. Wrexham was the first seat to be removed from 'Labour's Red Wall' in North Wales. Atherton supports travel discounts for certain people who have formerly worked in the UK armed forces and have been injured. In the House of Commons, she sits on the Defence Select Committee. Atherton is a member of the Armed Forces and Beer All-Party Parliamentary Groups. In January 2020, Atherton voted, with the majority, against an Opposition amendment \\"Proportional Representation to Elect MPs in the House of Commons\\". In February 2020, Atherton was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart. In February 2020, Sarah Atherton voted, with the majority, against an Opposition motion on \\"proper funding of public services along with robust action against tax avoidance and evasion\\". In the same month she voted, with the majority, against an Opposition motion \\"a plan to eliminate a substantial majority of transport emissions by 2030\\". In June 2020, it was reported during the coronavirus outbreak that Sarah Atherton limited her engagement on the platform Twitter to only her followers, with Twitter contributors criticising her for a lack of engagement via all means of communication. In the same month, she supported recent discussions about sexual abuse in the armed forces not being prosecuted in courts martial but in civilian courts. Atherton has come into some criticism for promoting the re-opening of a McDonald's outlet in Wrexham on her Twitter account, the criticism citing childhood obesity and small independent businesses that require help. Whilst it is a locally-owned franchise, licence fees are paid to McDonald's UK subsidiary. In July 2020, Atherton voted, with the majority, against a Green Party amendment to the Trade Bill which the proposer said \\"would aim to protect the NHS and publicly funded health and care services in other parts of the UK from any form of control from outside the UK\\". Quoted after the vote, Atherton said \\"I will continue to respect the manifesto upon which I was elected, which clearly stated that “when we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table\\".” In August 2020, Atherton provoked controversy after she suggested in a post that was widely condemned for being 'legally inaccurate' by multiple legal experts, that the army should be deployed to stop migrants crossing the English Channel. Atherton was described as displaying a \\"staggering level of ignorance\\" by the director Stand for All, a human rights advocacy group.

Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed \\"Scarlett\\", and consisting of high-end and low-end models codenamed \\"Anaconda\\" and \\"Lockhart\\" respectively. The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title \\"Project Scarlett\\", while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the low- end model as Xbox Series S. Microsoft is prioritizing hardware performance, including support for higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution) along with frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and use of high-speed solid-state drive to reduce loading times, on the Xbox Series X. The Xbox Series S uses the same CPU and reduced GPU, memory, and internal storage and lacks an optical drive. Microsoft is promoting a gamer-centric approach to their new hardware, including free upgrades which are enhanced versions of Xbox One games via their \\"Smart Delivery\\" initiative, games optimized for the Series X hardware, and backward compatibility with previous generation Xbox games, controllers and accessories. The console will also take advantage of their game subscription service Xbox Game Pass, as well as remote cloud gaming on mobile devices via their cloud game-streaming platform xCloud.  History   Initial unveiling and launch  Industry rumors of new Xbox hardware had started as early as June 2018, with Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirming they were \\"deep into architecturing the next Xbox consoles\\" at that time. The hardware was believed to be a family of devices under the codename \\"Scarlett\\", including a low-cost version, with major emphasis on game streaming and backward compatibility. By March 2019, further industry rumors had led to speculation of two consoles under the Scarlett family under codenames \\"Anaconda\\" and the low-cost \\"Lockhart\\" version. Microsoft confirmed Project Scarlett at its E3 2019 press conference. Microsoft said they wanted a \\"soft\\" transition from Xbox One to Scarlett, with Scarlett supporting backward compatibility with all games and most hardware supported on the Xbox One. During a presentation at The Game Awards 2019, Microsoft officially revealed the design of Scarlett and its branding, \\"Xbox Series X\\", as well as a late-2020 release date. Following the event, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that Xbox Series X constituted an entry in a fourth generation of Xbox hardware, which will be branded simply as \\"Xbox\\" with no subtitle. Microsoft planned to go into detail into the hardware specifications and launch games for the Series X at both the 2020 Game Developers Conference (GDC) and E3 2020, but both events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Microsoft scheduled online presentations over the same planned days in March 2020, while the company will schedule its planned E3 presentation at a later time. Detailed specifications were presented by Microsoft, Digital Foundry and Austin Evans of Overclock Media on March 16, 2020. Starting in May and running until launch, Microsoft planned to have additional digital events around the Xbox Series X and its games as part of an \\"Xbox 20/20\\" series. This included an Xbox Games Showcase on July 23, 2020, featuring games principally from its first-party Xbox Game Studios. On July 16, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had ended production of the Xbox One X and all-digital version of the Xbox One S in preparation for the new products. The existence of the Xbox Series S had been speculated prior to the E3 2019 reveal based on a \\"Project Lockhart\\" that accompanied Scarlett, a second lower-end console. Confirmation of the Xbox Series S naming was affirmed through early Xbox hardware accessories that some had been able to purchase. Microsoft officially announced the Series S console on September 8, 2020, revealing that it would also be released alongside the Series X in November 2020. Microsoft pointed out that the Series S had been discretely placed in the background of previous Xbox announcement videos featuring Phil Spencer during July 2020.  Hardware  When Microsoft's Xbox team started work on the successor to the Xbox One consoles around 2016, they had already envisioned the need to have two console versions similar to their Xbox One X and Xbox One S models to meet the needs of different markets. By developing both units in concert, they would be able to make sure games developed would be able to be played on both systems without exception. As has been tradition with past Xbox projects, the consoles were given code names based on cities. The Xbox Series S was named Project Lockhart, based on the city of Lockhart, Texas, which Alan Greenberg said was known as \\"the little city with the big heart\\". For the high end target, the Xbox Series X, their primary goal was to at least double the graphical performance of the Xbox One X as measured by its floating point operations per second (FLOPS), and increasing CPU performance four-fold compared to Xbox One X while maintaining the same acoustic performance from the Xbox One consoles. As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315 W) and would generate a significant amount of heat. This led to the decision to split the components onto two separate circuit boards; one housing the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board to act as a Southbridge board for slower input/output (I/O) functions. The boards mounted on opposite sides of an aluminum chassis helped to create air channels for cooling. The remaining components - the heat sink, the electric shielding, the power supply, the optical drive, and the cooling fan were then arranged in a Tetris- like fashion, according to principal designer Chris Kujawski, to achieve a compact form factor, resulting in the tower-like structure. To meet the acoustics factor, the system includes numerous sensors for controlling the speed of the fan, and the large open top was necessary to assure good air flow through the system. While certain elements like the optical drive, air flow requirements, and heat sink size fixed certain dimensions in the overall form factor, they were satisfied they were able to end up with a square footprint for the unit.  Xbox Series X  Xbox head Phil Spencer stated that Microsoft was prioritizing high frame rates and faster load times as a priority over higher resolutions, which the Series X achieves via the better- matched capabilities of the CPU and GPU. The Xbox Series X is powered by a custom 7 nm AMD Zen 2 CPU with eight cores running at a nominal 3.8 GHz, or when simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is used, at 3.6 GHz. One CPU core is dedicated to the underlying operating system. The graphics processing unit is also a custom unit based on AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture. It has a total of 56 compute units (CUs) with 3584 cores, with 52 CUs and 3328 cores enabled, and will be running at a fixed 1.825 GHz. This unit is capable of 12.15 teraflops of computational power. The unit ships with 16GB of GDDR6 SDRAM, with 10GB running at 560GB/s primarily to be used with the graphics system and the other 6GB at 336GB/s to be used for the other computing functions. After accounting for the system software, approximately 13.5GB of memory will be available for games and other applications, with the system software only drawing from the slower pool. The Xbox Series X target performance is to render games at 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, with the console being about four times as powerful as the Xbox One X. The Series X can support up to 120 frames per second, and can render up to 8K resolution. The Xbox Series X's console form is designed to be unobtrusive and minimalistic. It has a footprint and is high and weighs ; while configured in this vertical orientation, the unit can also be used on its side. Its forward-facing features present only the main power button and an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive. The top of the unit is a single powerful fan. Spencer stated that the console is as quiet as Xbox One X. The Series X includes an HDMI 2.1 output, the storage expansion slot, three USB 3.1 ports, and an ethernet port. The console does not include an infrared blaster or HDMI pass-through like the Xbox One line, supporting HDMI-CEC instead. An earlier leak had suggested a TOSLINK port for digital audio, but this was eliminated in the final design. Xbox Series S The Xbox Series S is comparable in its hardware to the Xbox Series X, similar to how the Xbox One S relates to the Xbox One X, but has less processing power. While it runs the same CPU with slightly slower clock frequencies, it uses a slower GPU, a custom RDNA2 with 20 CUs at 1.55 GHz for 4 TFLOPS, compared to 12 TFLOPS of the Series X. It ships with 10 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD storage unit with a raw input/output throughput of 2.4GB/s, and does not include any optical disc drive, thus requiring the user to gain all software from digital distribution. It is intended to render games nominally at 1440p, with support for a 4K upscaler, at 60 frames per second, although it can go as high at 120 frames per second at this resolution. Otherwise, the console has the same functions as the Xbox Series X, including ports, expansions, and game support. Microsoft had designed the Series S to easily fit inside of a small bag or backpack for portability and travel usage. The Series S unit is about 60% smaller by volume than the Series X, measuring in its vertical orientation. In this orientation, its large side surface features the major exhaust port for active air cooling, similar to the top surface of the Series X; additional vents are then located on the top of the Series S. The front features one USB connection and a headphone jack. The rear of the console includes the power connector, one HDMI port, two additional USB ports, and an Ethernet port. Like the Series X, the Series S can also be placed horizontally with the exhaust port facing upward to maintain airflow. The Series S will launch in a matte white case along with a matching controller, distinguishing it from the matte black that the Series X will use. Common features = Storage architecture = The Xbox Velocity Architecture logo Both consoles use a new storage solution, the Xbox Velocity Architecture, that includes hardware and software components to improve transfer speeds within the console, reduce the size of digital downloads, and give developers more flexibility. Central to this is the internal storage, a custom NVM Express (NVMe) SSD. On the Series X, this is a 1 TB SSD with a raw input/output throughput of 2.4 GB/s. An on-board compression/decompression block includes both the industry standard Lempel-Ziv decompression algorithm and a proprietary one geared for game textures, and gives a combined throughput as high as 4.8 GB/s. Within the software, a new DirectStorage API within DirectX allows developers to fine-tune priority to input/output aspects with other processing threads. The software provides sampler feedback streaming that aids in loading multiple textures in segments to deal with level of detail rendering rather than having to read these textures as a whole before using them. The Series S will include a 512 GB SSD with similar custom hardware and software specifications. Developers at The Coalition found that without any changes to their code, Gears 5 loaded four times faster on Xbox Series X than Xbox One X due to the higher throughput on memory and storage, and would be able to increase this further once they incorporated the new DirectStorage API routines. The consoles will support external storage through a proprietary SSD expansion card inserted into the back of the console, which will be manufactured exclusively by Seagate Technology on launch and limited to a 1 TB size, though a 2 TB version is planned later. Due to the Xbox Velocity Architecture, games for the new console must be installed and run off the built-in SSD or expansion card, though their content may be transferred to the external USB storage to make space for other games, and back to the internal storage at a later time. Backward compatible games for the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and original Xbox can be run from the USB storage device, which can also be used to transfer content directly from an Xbox One console. All SSD storage on the architecture uses PCI Express 4.0. = Video and audio rendering technologies= Both the Series X and Series S support real-time ray-tracing and support the new features of the HDMI 2.1 standard including variable refresh rate (VRR) and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) that are currently being incorporated into newer televisions. The console will have dedicated audio hardware acceleration. A feature called \\"audio ray tracing\\" will use the graphics ray tracing processors to process spatial audio in the same manner to improve the audio immersion for the player. Another goal for Microsoft is reducing the effects of input latency to improve responsiveness, adding support for HDMI 2.1 Auto Low Latency Mode and Variable Refresh Rate features, and \\"dynamic latency input\\" technology—a new input pathway that allows developers to incorporate potential controller lag into their games. Both consoles support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos technologies.

It will include all the same key buttons as the past controllers: two analog joysticks that can be depressed, a circle pad, four action buttons, two system buttons (\\"View\\" and \\"Menu\\"), the main Xbox home button, two grip triggers (left and right) and two shoulder buttons (left and right). The new controller adds a \\"Share\\" button alongside the \\"View\\" and \\"Menu\\" buttons, which is used to record and share video clips or screenshots of gameplay. The user will be able to take a screenshot with a single press of the Share button, while holding down the Share button will start to record gameplay, and after either, can be shared to social media or their Xbox game feed. Microsoft found that by aiming the size to fit an eight- year-old's hands, they were able to make the design fit a larger section of the population, and thus features more sculpted grips, and reducing and rounding the trigger buttons. The D-pad is a new concave design that senior console designer Ryan Whitaker said was a means to merge the normal D-pad style on the standard Xbox One controller and the version on the Elite variant to accommodate a range of playstyles. Small tactile dot patterns have been added to the buttons to help players orient fingers on the controls. The controller will continue to use two AA batteries, though a rechargeable battery pack will be available as an accessory. Microsoft found from focus group studies that players were split nearly 50/50 on the use of batteries versus recharging and thus gave the controller the option to use either. The controller uses the same wireless protocol introduced by the Xbox One, and is backward compatible with existing Xbox One consoles. Existing Xbox One controllers will also be compatible with Xbox Series X. The new controller also supports the Bluetooth Low Energy standard allowing it to pair with mobile devices and other hardware supporting that standard, and will have internal storage to remember those connections. The new controller uses a standard USB-C charging port for its battery. Spencer said that the Xbox Series X will likely not have immediate virtual reality (VR) support at launch, and that they expect that any VR support will be based on the Windows Mixed Reality components contained within the console's Windows 10 components, but was otherwise not a focus of the console's development prior to release. System software and features Both consoles feature a similar user interface (UI) to the Xbox One, but there has been a 40% reduction in memory use to improve its speed. According to the UI development team, the Home section loads in about half the time as it did on the Xbox One. Other changes include adding rounded UI elements, a more-readable font for text elements, rearrangement of certain aligned features, and improvements to the sharing functions. These changes were brought to the Xbox One system software, the Windows' Xbox application, and the Xbox mobile application around September 2020. Based on system previews, about 200 MB of space was reserved on the internal drive of the Xbox Series X for system files. The console's Quick Resume feature will allow users to suspend and resume more than one game at a time, and also resume suspended games after a reboot of the console. The console will leverage the game subscription service Xbox Game Pass, giving users unlimited access to hundreds of downloadable games for a monthly fee. As with the Xbox One, all first-party (and selected third-party) titles will appear on the platform upon release. As part of the service, users will be able to stream games remotely from their console onto a supported mobile device via their cloud game-streaming platform xCloud. This will be available at no extra cost to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Microsoft plans to migrate the xCloud service from Xbox One S-based blade servers to Xbox Series X-based systems by 2021.  Games  Developers are be able to optimize existing and newly released Xbox One games to take advantage of Xbox Series X technologies, with higher graphics throughput and faster frame rates, ray tracing, and support for the console's storage architecture. These games will be marketed with an \\"Optimized for Series X\\" logo. Microsoft is offering a distribution framework known as \\"Smart Delivery\\" that will automatically download optimized versions of Xbox One games for the console when available; Microsoft has positioned this feature at publishers who plan to release Series X-specific versions of games after releasing on Xbox One, and to users migrating from an existing Xbox One to Series X. Microsoft is not restricting the ability for developers to release games that are exclusive to Xbox Series X. The company is preferring a \\"soft\\" transition more in line with PC gaming, where developers can target optimal play on high-end hardware (such as Series X), but still allow the game to be played with reduced fidelity on lower-end hardware (such as older Xbox One consoles). Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty stated that Microsoft wanted to ensure that those who buy Xbox One consoles prior to the Series X launch would still \\"feel that they made a good investment and that we're committed to them with content\\". Spencer explained that this approach was about putting the player at the center rather than the console, and not \\"forcing\\" users to migrate. According to Spencer, this concept is enabled in part by many of the Xbox Game Studios subsidiaries having familiarity with developing also on personal computers, where there is a wide range of hardware targets to meet. The same approach in personal computer game development was taken to make Xbox Series X games that could scale down to perform well on the Xbox One consoles while still taking advantage of the new hardware. Initially, Spencer suggested that their first- party studios' games would support both Xbox One and Xbox Series X platforms for the \\"next couple of years\\", but journalists observed that some of the first-party games introduced in the Xbox Game Showcase in July 2020 omitted mention of the Xbox One, and their websites later updated to omit mention of the Xbox One. While none of these games were believed to be launch titles, they were expected to be released within the window Spencer had previously suggested. This led to Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing, to clarify that these games were being developed for the Xbox Series X first, leaving the choice of adding Xbox One support to their development studios as they went forward. Microsoft has not placed any similar requirements on a soft transition on third party developers and publishers, allowing them to offer Xbox Series X exclusives or other routes to upgrade from the Xbox One edition of a game, though Video Games Chronicle reported that Microsoft had urged publishers to keep the upgrade path free if they took that option. CD Projekt RED and Ubisoft have committed to using Smart Delivery for their upcoming releases. Electronic Arts affirmed for at least one game, Madden NFL 21, it will offer a free update patch from the Xbox One version to the Xbox Series X version prior to the release of the next Madden NFL game. Backward compatibility Microsoft has stated that Xbox Series X and Series S will support all games playable on Xbox One (excluding those that require the Kinect sensor), including those Xbox 360 and original Xbox console games currently supported through backward compatibility on the Xbox One, thus allowing the console to support four generations of games. To achieve this level of compatibility, Microsoft announced they would no longer be bringing any additional Xbox 360 or original Xbox games into the Xbox One backward compatibility program in June 2019, and instead using their manpower to make sure these older games were playable on the Xbox Series X. Backward compatibility is planned as a launch feature, with Microsoft expected to have put in more than 200,000 manhours in validating thousands of games; Spencer said in December 2019 that he himself had been helping to test backward compatibility games. As Microsoft neared launch, they reopened the means for players to suggest additional games to add to backward compatibility, stating \\"Resurrecting titles from history often presents a complex mix of technical and licensing challenges, but the team is committed to doing everything we can to continue to preserve our collective gaming legacy.\\" Because of the processing features of the Xbox Series X and S, it is possible for advanced graphic processes options not originally programmed into these older games to be worked into the game when played on the console, such as automated High- dynamic-range rendering (HDR) support using machine learning, framerate doubling, 16x anisotropic filtering, and resolution upscale. Work done by the Xbox Advanced Technology Group prior to launch was focused on how far into the backward-compatibility library they could take these improvements including into original Xbox games, adding in features like HDR or improving the framerate of games that may have been programmed to be locked at a specific framerate. Backward compatible games will be supported under the Quick Resume feature as well. Players will be able to use cloud saves to bring Xbox One saved games to the Xbox Series X/S, and Microsoft plans to enable free cloud saving on the Xbox 360 hardware before the new console's launch for the same purpose. Xbox Series S will be able to play Xbox One games with improved performance, texture filtering, and auto HDR support, but does not support Xbox One X-specific enhancements. Microsoft is providing development tools for developers to check the performance of their Xbox One games on the Series X and S consoles, which can suggest optimizations \\"as easy as changing three lines of code\\" to support the improvements in backward compatibility.  Release  In March 2020, Microsoft stated that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, they expect the Xbox Series X to ship by the end of 2020, though they are monitoring supply chains and the safety of their workers. Spencer believes that while the hardware will continue to ship on time, games poised for the release window of Xbox Series X may be delayed due to the pandemic. In August 2020, at the same time that 343 Industries stated it would be delaying the planned launch title Halo Infinite until 2021 due to development issues, Microsoft committed to a November 2020 release window for the Xbox Series X, affirming the console's release was still on track. Microsoft also affirmed that the Xbox Series X and Series S will otherwise have 31 games available at launch, including those from its Xbox Game Studios and from other third-party publishers, in addition to those from its Xbox One backwards compatibility. Both the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles are planned to launch on November 10, 2020. Microsoft confirmed that the Series X will be priced , , and and the Series S will be priced at , , and . Microsoft will continue its Xbox All- Access financing plans (which bundle the hardware, Xbox Live Gold, and Xbox Game Pass as part of a monthly payment plan) for Series X. Current All Access plans with the Xbox One will include routes to upgrade to the Xbox Series X, and Spencer states that there will be similar upgrades from the Xbox Series X in the future. The All-Access option for the Xbox Series X option will be based on a 24-month plan at while the Series S will be based on a plan.

She is the first Conservative to represent the constituency since its creation in 1885. The seat had previously been represented by a Labour Party MP since 1935. Early life Dehenna Sheridan Davison was born on 27 July 1993 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England where she grew up on a council estate. Her father was a stonemason, and her mother was a nursery nurse. Davison was educated at the independent Sheffield High School, on a full scholarship. When she was 13 years old her father was attacked and killed; his assailant being jailed for manslaughter. Three years later she represented the family at a criminal injuries compensation tribunal. She has commented in interviews that the experience fostered her interest in politics. Davison studied British Politics and Legislative Studies at the University of Hull. During her time at the university, she spent a year working as a parliamentary aide for Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Member of Parliament (MP) for North East Somerset. Davison was also an National Union of Students (NUS) delegate and played for the university's lacrosse team. She led a successful campaign to disaffiliate the university's student union from the NUS in 2016. In the same year, Davison was the Conservative candidate for the Kings Park ward in the Hull City Council election, where she finished last. In 2018, she again contested for a Hull City Council seat, where she finished fifth in the Kingswood ward. In her late teens and early twenties, she had a variety of jobs including in a video games retailer, a casino, a betting shop, and a branch of Pizza Hut. Parliamentary career Davison was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Kingston upon Hull North constituency in the 2015 general election. She finished in third behind the Labour Party and UK Independence Party candidates. Davison supported Brexit in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. She next contested the Sedgefield constituency in the 2017 general election where she finished second behind the Labour candidate. She was elected as MP for the Bishop Auckland constituency in the 2019 general election, with a majority of 7,962 (17.8%) on a swing of 9.5% from Labour to the Conservatives. Davison was the first Conservative MP for the constituency since its creation in 1885. The seat had been represented by a Labour MP since 1935. Her campaign focused on promises on Brexit, and reopening Bishop Auckland Hospital's emergency department which had been closed in 2009. Prior to becoming an MP, Davison was a research and development analyst for LUMO, a company which advises businesses on tax credits. She made her maiden speech on 16 January 2020. Davison supports scrapping the planned high-speed railway project HS2, and re-investing the money into local transport schemes. On 14 February, it was reported that she had been photographed with two far-right activists at a party to celebrate Brexit on 31 January in her constituency. Advocacy group Hope not Hate called for the Conservatives to undertake an investigation. In response, Davison distanced herself from the views of the two men, stating, \\"These photos were taken at an event open to the public and I in no way whatsoever condone the views highlighted of the individuals concerned.\\" Davison has been a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee since March 2020. She is also a member of the European Research Group, on the steering committee of the China Research Group,, on the board of the Blue Collar Conservatives, and a member of the parliamentary council of the centre-right think tank The Northern Policy Foundation. In September 2020, Davison was criticised by her own party after she mocked Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard for having an English accent and suggested that this was the reason for Labour's decline in support in Scotland. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said that: “The reason Labour have no credibility or relevance in Scotland, as their own MP Ian Murray has said, has got nothing to do with Richard Leonard’s accent. This criticism is unacceptable. It plays into the kind of divisive politics that the SNP promote.” Conservative MSP Dean Lockhart also distanced himself from Davison's comments and stated that Leonard's accent is \\"irrelevant\\". Personal life Davison married John Fareham, a Conservative councillor on Hull City Council in 2018. He is 35 years older than her. They appeared together on the Channel 4 documentary series Bride and Prejudice, which showed their wedding at the Guildhall, Kingston upon Hull. They separated before the 2019 general election. She lives in the village of High Etherley in her parliamentary constituency. As part of Mental Health Awareness Week 2019, Davison discussed her personal experience of depression and suicidal ideation while working in London as a parliamentary aide after her grandmother had been diagnosed with cancer.

She was elected at the age of 23, and became the Baby of the House as the youngest MP. She is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, a parliamentary group of Labour MPs. Early life Whittome was born on 29 August 1996 in Nottingham, England. Her Punjabi Sikh father emigrated to the UK from Banga, India at the age of 21. He has worked a variety of jobs including as an immigration advisor, factory worker, miner, and a driving instructor. Her mother is an Anglo-Indian Catholic solicitor whose parents emigrated from Calcutta in the 1950s. She was formerly a member of the Labour Party, who left the party in protest at the amendment of Clause IV of the constitution in 1995. Whittome has a brother who works as a bricklayer in Sydney. Her grandparents belonged to the Communist Party of India. She grew up in a single-parent household. Whittome reports that she attended a private school between the ages of 7 and 11. She later attended West Bridgford School, a local comprehensive which was formerly a grammar. Whittome has lived in the Meadows, Top Valley, and West Bridgford. She has commented in interviews that she first got involved in politics in 2013 due to the effects of the under-occupancy penalty and austerity on her local community. Whittome worked as a parliamentary intern in the constituency office of the Member of Parliament (MP) for North West Durham Pat Glass, Shadow Minister of State for Europe, during the 2016 European Union referendum campaign. Glass stood down at the 2017 general election. She studied law at Nottingham University for two years before dropping out for financial reasons. Prior to this, she completed an access course at Nottingham College. While studying there, she contested the 2017 Nottinghamshire County Council election as the Labour candidate for the West Bridgford West ward, where she finished second to the Conservative candidate with 1,393 votes. Whittome later dropped out of university due to financial reasons, and worked as a hate crime project worker at Communities Inc, and as a carer. Prior to her election, she was a national committee member of the pro-Remain organisations Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a Socialist Europe. Parliamentary career Whittome was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Nottingham East on 28 October 2019. She was elected as the MP for the constituency in the December general election with a majority of 17,393 (43.4%). Elected at the age of 23, she was the youngest MP and therefore gained the unofficial title of Baby of the House. The seat had been won by the Labour Party candidate at every election since the 1992 general election, and had previously been represented by Chris Leslie, himself a former Baby of the House. Whittome is of Punjabi descent, and was also the first BAME MP elected in Nottingham. She identifies as a democratic socialist. Shortly after her election, she announced that she would only be keeping the equivalent of \\"an average worker's wage\\", as determined by the Office for National Statistics, of £35,000, and would donate the remainder of her £79,468 salary as an MP to local charities. Whittome initially supported Clive Lewis in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election but after Lewis withdrew his candidacy, nominated Emily Thornberry to ensure she received enough nominations to proceed to the next stage. On 28 February 2020, Whittome announced that she would be voting for Rebecca Long-Bailey for leader and Dawn Butler for deputy. In February 2020, Whittome organised a letter signed by 170 MPs demanding that foreign-born offenders not be deported back to Jamaica. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she worked as a part-time carer at a care home. Whittome appeared on Newsnight in April where she discussed shortages in PPE at her workplace. Shortly after her appearance on the show, she claimed that she had been fired from her job as a carer for \\"spreading misinformation\\". Her employer ExtraCare denied that there were any shortages in PPE at the care home and also stated that Whittome had not been fired but that her services were \\"no longer needed\\" as their own in-house care team could now meet their needs. In September however ExtraCare issued a statement in which they admitted that there had been shortages of PPE at the care home and that Whittome had helped to resolve this through public appeals in March and April. Following Keir Starmer taking over as Leader of the Labour Party in April 2020, Whittome was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care. In September 2020, Whittome was one of eighteen Labour MP’s who defied the Labour whip and voted against the Overseas Operations Bill. She said the bill was “anti-veteran, anti-human rights, and would effectively decriminalise torture”. In response, she was sacked as shadow minister.

This confluence is located at: * north-east of the village center of L'Anse-Saint-Jean; * northwest of the village center of Petit-Saguenay; * west of Tadoussac.  History  The name of the river was mentioned by James McKenzie in the legislature of Lower Canada in 1824. The occupation of the region dates back to the late 1830s. In 1842, a sawmill was built near the mouth of the Petit Saguenay River. William Price (1789-1867) bought it in 1844 and established a model farm there which also became the headquarters of his activities in the area. As a result, river salmon became scarce due to the presence of sawmills and overfishing. The fire of Mr. Price's sawmill in 1870 resulted in the displacement of upstream dwellings on the present site of the village of Petit-Saguenay.  Fishing  Salmon fishing rights in the Petit Saguenay River were first held by William Price. At the end of the 19th century, they passed into the hands of several rich English speakers, before being granted to clubs and associations. In 1950, a group of Americans acquired land bordering the river, upstream of the village, and built fishing lodges. This complex (land and construction), known as the \\"Gentlemen's Club\\", is now managed under the name of \\"Petit-Saguenay River Site\\". Since 1999, the territory has been established in controlled harvesting zone (zec) and the \\"Petit-Saguenay River Association\\" has been managing Atlantic salmon sport fishing since 1966. The organization is recognized for its role in the sustainable development of salmon resources by being the founder of the Atlantic Salmon Protective Charter. Thirteen of the 88.4 kilometers are open to salmon fishing, including one on the Portage River, a tributary of Petit- Saguenay. For the salmon fishery, the river has 24 pits in 1 open access area and 2 restricted access areas.  Toponymy  The name \\"Petit Saguenay River\\" was originally mentioned in 1824 by James McKenzie, at the House of Assembly of Lower Canada who wanted to know more about this sector. McKenzie then refers to the \\"Little River named Petit Saguenay on which we also take salmon.\\" Quoted by Russel Bouchard, in \\"Ghost Villages, Missing or Unknown Places in the Bas-Saguenay\\", Société historique du Saguenay, 1991, page 10. Surveyor William Tremblay, in his report on the canton of Saint-Jean, in 1893, mentions the \\"Petit Saguenay River\\" to identify this watercourse.Published in Regions of Quebec, Lac-Saint-Jean, Chicoutimi and the North Shore of the St. Lawrence, Description of the surveyed townships, explorations of territories and surveys of rivers and lakes, from 1889 to 1908, published by the Ministry of Lands and Forests, Quebec, 1908, page 11. In Quebec toponymy, we often find duplicates in diminutive of the main watercourse (ex.: \\"Saguenay river\\" versus \\"Petit Saguenay river\\"). The toponym \\"Petit Saguenay River\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Bank of Place Names of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

This formation lies in the northwestern sector of San Luis, about 25 km west of Santa Rosa de Conlara. Containing a slice of the Carboniferous-Permian transition, it is one of the key upper Paleozoic successions characterizing that era in westernmost Gondwana, which South America was a part of in the Paleozoic. It consists of Cautana (Upper Carboniferous), Pallero (end-Pennsylvanian to Cisuralian), and Lomas (Permian) units. Based on the paleoflora found in the middle upper Pallero unit, it was suggested to be of earliest Cisuralian age of the early Permian, though there is still ambiguity as insects associated with that layer have been assigned to the late Pennsylvanian of the Carboniferous. It is one of the key windows into the fossil life of the Gzhelian to Asselian, and is known as the formation where the thought-to-be-spider Megarachne, actually a giant eurypterid, was discovered.  Discovery  A map of Pangaea, with Gondwana in the southwest. Glossopteris is preserved in the Bajo de Veliz Formation. The Bajo de Véliz Formation was deﬁned by Flores in 1969, and then studied in greater detail by Hünicken and Pensa, in 1972. Hünicken and Pensa estimated a geological column of 168 meters in thickness. For several years the area was exploited in order to extract slab stone. In the course of this activity, an extraordinary fossil was found due to its conservation status and its size, which was handed over to the Argentine paleontologist Mario Hünicken who in 1980 described it as Megarachne servinei. Research carried out subsequently produced remarkable findings in successive strata, several of which present evidence of insect fossils, bryophytes and paleozoic flora. It is estimated that this formation is 286 million years old. The stratum is part of a protected natural park, . The main geographical feature is a 12 km long depression. The Cautana Creek runs along most of its length. The stratigraphic succession of Bajo de Véliz is exposed by rocky outcrops such as a rock wall revealing the Pallero unit, and there are escarpments because the formation is cut and carved out of older crust.  Composition  fossil flora of Gondwana, many of which have been found in Bajo de Veliz: 1, Glossopteris. 2, Gangamopteris. 3, Ncegyerathiopaia (Cordaites). 4, Vertebraria, the underground stem or rhizome of Glossopteris and Gangamopteris. The Bajo de Véliz Formation is a sedimentary deposit representing the Upper Carboniferous to Permian. It is located in a graben, which means it is a depressed block of the crust bordered by higher parallel faults. As a result, it is surrounded by much older rock which is raised above it on the sides, and forms a basement below. This ancient, separate unit is called the San Luis Formation, which ranges from the Upper Precambrian to the early Carboniferous in age, and includes igneous and metamorphic rocks. Among San Luis's metamorphic materials are phyllites. With the San Luis Formation, Bajo de Véliz forms a complex. The Bajo de Véliz Formation can be described as silica-rich. It contains mostly greenish-grey sandstones and lutaceous sedimentary grains. Geologists starting with Hünicken and Pensa have classified the Bajo de Véliz unit into three component members: from lowest to highest, the Cautana, Pallero, and Lomas members. The Cautana member (102 meters thick) contains clastic rock which grades upward from a coarse bed of polymictic conglomerate at the base, to an intercalated layer of sandstone and greenish-grey siltstone. This is overlaid by a caprock of arkosic or feldspar-rich sandstones and cut banks of greenish siltstone. The Pallero member (53 meters thick) contains clearly-banded and fine-grained material: sandstones, as well as green beds with numerous fossil remains, dropstones, disk-shaped concretions. and varved clayrocks. Pallero's well-preserved fossils include plants, microfossils, and arthropods. At the time, it probably saw climatic variation and faced alternating or overlapping lacustrine (lake) and fluviatile (riverine) conditions, based on sedimentological and paleobotanical evidence. In the case of Megarachne, terrestrial biota were washed into an alluvial environment, buried by mud, and then preserved as carbonized replacements. Permian bryophyte genera are also found, such as Uskatia and Bajdaievia. Carbonated springs are thought to have formed three calcareous banks during times of low decomposition. The Lomas member (13 meters thick) contains sandstone, which is medium to coarse-grained and ranges in color from yellowish to dark greenish, crowning the formation.  Paleobiology  Trigonotarbid Gondwanarachne. A similar Late Carboniferous arachnid, Eophrynus (of Europe) is pictured. The Bajo de Véliz succession preserves a number of fossil organisms directly, as well as ichnofossils of ancient biological activity. Most of its remains originate from the Carboniferous-Permian boundary, and include plants, arthropods, and worms.  Fossil flora  In the Gzhelian stage, the land that became the formation would have been a freshwater environment in a floodplain. The Pallero Member provides well-preserved fossil plants: glossopterid, cordaitales, sphenophytes, pteridosperms, lycophytes, conifers and seeds. These include Gangamopteris, Euryphyllum, Glossopteris, and Samaropsis, The formation also preserves arthropods, including insects and eurypterids such as Megarachne, The FS (fusus-subsaccata) biozone is well defined in the formation by the presence of Pakhapites fusus and abundant species of Vittatina subsaccata, which are fossilized pollen or spores. Similarly, the organic-walled microfossils of Clogranisporites patelliformis and Acantotriletes ﬁliformis are preserved. Bajo de Véliz contains a wide array of fossilized flying insects, such as the Rigattoptera (a pterygote classified in the order Protorthoptera), Megasecoptera, Velisoptera, and others. Trace activity of herbivorous invertebrates also survives. Insects fed on plants forming galls and oviposition traces, and to a lesser extent marginal damage from piercing and sucking mouthparts. There is also a trace fossil Meanderovaleichnus huenickeni. interpreted as the locomotion 'footprint' of a burrowing worm.

Life and career  Wallis was born in Bettws, Bridgend, the son of Daryl Hamilton Wallis, a computer forensics expert. He was a member of Pencoed council, representing the Hendre ward, until 2018, when he was replaced because of non- attendance at meetings. He later stated that he had resigned from the council by letter, but the council had not received the letter. He said that his reason for resigning was that he had relocated to Cowbridge, where he joined the town council. Wallis is one of the owners of a company called Fields Holdings Limited, the parent company of Action Direct (UK) Limited, a former claims management company of which Wallis was a director in 2011 when the Ministry of Justice banned it from taking on any further employment claims work, following an investigation into the company's conduct. \\\\- In July 2010, a Freedom of Information request (2417) was made to Bridgend County Borough Council asking how many complaints or referrals to Trading Standards had been made about a Field House associated company Rapid Data Recovery Ltd, which returned the response that between 1 January 2009 and mid-2010, 37 complaints had been received, a figure which included associated companies. In January 2020, after being elected to Parliament, Wallis threatened to take legal action against BCBC over the matter under the Freedom of Information Act. \\\\- Alex Wickham and Alberto Nardelli, \\"A New Tory MP's Companies Were Subject To Hundreds Of Trading Standards Complaints\\", BuzzFeed News, 9 January 2020.

A unique feature of SEE is that it unifies multiple different branches of electrochemistry. Single-Entity Electrochemistry pushes the bounds of the field as it can measure entities on a scale of 100 microns to angstroms. Single-Entity Electrochemistry is important because it gives the ability to view how a single molecule, or cell, or \\"thing\\" affects the bulk response, and thus the chemistry that might have gone unknown otherwise. The ability to monitor the movement of one electron or ion from one unit to another is valuable, as many vital reactions and mechanisms undergo this process. Electrochemistry is well suited for this measurement due to its incredible sensitivity. Single-Entity Electrochemistry can be used to investigate nanoparticles, wires, vesicles, nanobubbles, nanotubes, cells, and viruses, and other small molecules and ions. Single- entity electrochemistry has been successfully used to determine the size distribution of particles as well as the number of particles present inside a vesicle or other similar structures Early history  Coulter Counter  The Coulter Counter was created by Wallace H. Coulter in 1949. The Coulter counter consists of two electrolyte reservoirs that are connected by a small channel, through which a current of ions flow. Each particle drawn through the channel causes a brief change to the electrical resistance of the liquid. The change in the electrical resistance causes a disturbance in the electric field. The counter detects these changes in electrical resistance; the size of the particles in the field is proportional to magnitude of the disturbance in the electric field.  Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology  Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology was developed by Neher and Sakmann in 1976. This technique allowed measurements of individual proteins through ion channels. A glass pipette was fixed to the cell membrane, and the ion currents though the ion channels were measured. The Patch-Clamp method increased the sensitivity of detection by three orders of magnitude over previous methods, and the time resolution for the measurements was decreased to nearly 10 microseconds. The success of this method was a result of the ability to create a high resistance seal between the glass micropipette and the cell membrane; isolating the system chemically and electrically.  Single-Cell Electrochemistry  While it is useful to study bulk cell entities, there is an underlying need to study an individual or single cell as it will provide a better understanding of how it contributes to the entity as a whole. It was found that the utilization of electrochemical techniques could analyze cells without interrupting cellular activity as well as provide a highly resolute spectrum. This analysis method was first completed by Wightman in 1982. In this method of analysis, a carbon microfiber electrode is placed near the studied cell; this electrode can monitor the call via methods of voltammetry or amperometry. Before the measure can be taken, the cell must be stimulated by an ejection pipette to cause a cellular release. This can be cellular release can be measured via the aforementioned methods. From this method, it was seen that instrumental advances were needed in order to perform quality SEE measurements.  Single- Molecule Redox Cycling  Single-Molecule electrochemistry is an electrochemical technique used to study the faradaic response of redox molecules in electrochemical environments. The ability to study singular molecules gives rise to the potential of developing ultra-sensitive sensors which are necessary in SEE. From the work of Bard and Fan, this technique has had large advances with the use of redox cycling. Redox cycling amplifies a charge transfer by reducing and oxidizing a molecule multiple times as it diffuses between electrodes. Specifically in this technique, an insulated nano-electrode tip is placed near a substrate electrode to form an ultra-small electrochemical chamber. Molecules will become trapped in this chamber where the redox cycling and charge amplification will occur, allowing for detection of single molecules. From this technique, the necessary tool of charge amplification of redox reactions helped improve SEE measurements. It has helped increase detection limits, which need to be high for SEE.  Applications   Single-Cell Electrochemistry  With the advance of nanoscale electrodes, the resolution of SEE has advanced from being able to detect single cells to detecting single molecules within cells.Chen, R.; Hu, K. K.; Yu, Y.; Mirkin, M. V.; Amemiya, S. Focused-Ion-Beam-Milled Carbon Nanoelectrodes for Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy. J. Electrochem. Soc. 2016, 163, H3032−H3037 Nanoscale electrodes are small enough they can be inserted into the synapses between neurons, which can be used to detect neurotransmitter concentrations.Li, Y.

Nanoelectrode for Amperometric Monitoring of Individual Vesicular Exocytosis Inside Single Synapses. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 12456−12460. If the electrode is thin enough, it can be inserted directly into a cell and used to detect concentrations of intracellular molecules, such as metabolites or even DNA.Ying, Y. L.; Hu, Y. X.; Gao, R.; Yu, R. J.; Gu, Z.; Lee, L. P.; Long, Y. T. Asymmetric Nanopore Electrode-Based Amplification for Electron Transfer Imaging in Live Cells. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 5385−5392.  Optoelectrochemical Imaging  Plasmonic nanoparticles can be individually analyzed through optoelectrochemical imaging (in which electrochemical processes are measured by optical means). When electrochemistry is performed on a nanoparticle, the refractive index of its environment will change resulting in a shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance. The spectral difference can be measured through characterization techniques such as darkfield microscopy to monitor electrochemical reactions at the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles. Plasmonics-based electrochemical current microscopy (PECM) measures the contrast that appears from the interference of localized surface plasmon scattered light and reflected light that, like above, is sensitive to changes in the refractive index. This can be used to quantify the electrocatalytic reactions occurring at Pt nanoparticles. Since nanoparticles are inherently heterogenous (which affects catalytic activity), SEE methods can provide more information than traditional methods that measure the average of an ensemble of nanoparticles.

She has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Great Grimsby since the 2019 general election. She was formerly a media studies lecturer at Grimsby Institute, and executive producer of Estuary TV from 2013–2018, where she also lists herself as having been CEO of Estuary TV following the dissolving of the CIC company by the Grimsby Institute and Estuary TV becoming, in effect, a department of the college.  Early life and career  Nici was a college lecturer for 20 years, including in the Media Studies department at what is now the Grimsby Institute, a further-education college. She was head of East Coast Media at the Institute from 2004. She was the Executive Producer of Estuary TV, a Grimsby-based Community Interest Company, from 2013 until the company was dissolved. Following its dissolution, she continued to act as CEO of \\"Estuary TV\\" (now a department of the Institute, who had owned and dissolved the CIC). Nici has listed herself as having been self-employed since September 2018.  Political career   Elections  After failing to be selected in Grimsby and Scunthorpe, Nici stood as the Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of Kingston upon Hull North in 2017, losing to sitting Labour MP Diana Johnson by 14,322 votes. In May 2018, she was elected as a councillor for the Scartho ward of North East Lincolnshire Council. In August 2019, Nici was selected as the Conservative candidate for Great Grimsby for the 2019 snap general election. She won the seat with 54.9% of the vote and a margin of 7,331 votes over Labour, who had held the seat for 74 years; defeating the sitting Labour MP Melanie Onn, who had represented Great Grimsby since Austin Mitchell's retirement in 2015.  Background  Nici was for several years the Executive Producer of Estuary TV, a local television channel incorporated as a ‘Community Interest Company’, a registered entity intended to be run for community benefit. The channel was criticised for receiving £300,000 from the BBC under a scheme to meet quotas of local news content in return for subsidies. Data from 2014 showed that its programmes were seen by fewer than 200 people, some having no viewers at all. The BBC refused to reveal how many of Estuary TV's programmes it actually broadcast. Following Estuary TV CIC's dissolution by owners the Grimsby Institute, Nici continued as executive producer of \\"Estuary TV\\", now a department of the Institute, and on 8 May 2018 confirmed herself in the register of NE Lincolnshire Councillors' interests as being the \\"CEO\\" of Estuary TV. Just under five years after becoming a figurehead for the government's new local television programme, the channel's licence was transferred to local television network That's TV, finally being replaced by That's Humber in October 2018. Despite voting to remain in the European Union in 2016, Nici subsequently became a supporter of leaving the organisation, and her party's approach to the exit process. In December 2019, she drew criticism for claiming that the government's failure to have yet taken the country out of the EU was \\"a failure of people who live in northern towns like Grimsby\\".

Semerand created an atmosphere of pomp and grandeur, expressed in his painting of Citadelle Laferrière and Sans-Souci Palace. Biography Born on 4 September 1953 in Cap-Haïtien, Semerand grew up in Port-au-Prince. He spent a year at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in France, but was largely self-taught. He was very attracted to the \\"Gingerbread\\" house movement that was prevalent in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. However, he created and sold most of his artwork from home. In 1984, Semerand's talent was discovered during Pope John Paul II's visit to Haiti. The following year, he had a major exhibition in Paris. He won a prize in 1992 with a painting titled \\"La découverte d'Haïti par Christophe Colomb\\", which was published in the German magazine Stern. In the early 1990s Semerand presented numerous exhibitions in Haiti and Florida. In 1997, he won a prize in art from the communications company TELECO, Inc. Semerand's artwork would be printed on Haitian stamps. Many of these works are now in exhibition at Expressions Art Gallery.

He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bassetlaw in the 2019 general election. Personal life Clarke-Smith was born in Clifton, Nottingham in 1980. He grew up on a council estate in Nottingham and was the first member of his family to go to university, studying politics at Nottingham Trent University and gaining a PGCE in religious education. He became a teacher and later Head of an International School in Romania. At the time of his election to Parliament, he lived in Edwinstowe with his Romanian wife, who is a doctor at Bassetlaw Hospital. They have a four-year-old son. Political career Clarke-Smith contested the EU elections in 2014 and 2019 in the East Midlands region. In May 2019, Clarke-Smith overturned a Labour majority in Boughton and Walesby to be elected as a Councillor on Newark & Sherwood District Council. He was selected as the Conservative party candidate for Bassetlaw in the December 2019 elections when the sitting MP John Mann stood down. He overturned a Labour majority with the biggest swing in the election, from a 4,852 Labour majority to a 14,013 Conservative majority. This is the first time Bassetlaw has been represented by a party other than Labour since Malcolm MacDonald won the seat in 1929. As one of the Conservative MPs who overturned Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' in the North and Midlands in the 2019 election, Clarke-Smith has varyingly been described by the press as part of \\"the Blue Collar Caucus\\" and a \\"Red Wall Tory MP\\". Clarke-Smith said after his election as an MP that he has three main priorities: * \\"Getting Brexit done\\" * Improving Bassetlaw Hospital * Attracting more money for Retford and Worksop town centres. In March 2020 Clarke-Smith was appointed to the International Development Committee. Political opinions Clarke-Smith campaigned to leave the EU in the 2016 EU referendum and was a member of the Bassetlaw Vote Leave campaign, which secured a 67.8% leave vote. In May 2019 he commented that leaving the EU offered the chance to create more opportunities for young people globally, saying \\"We’re not leaving Europe, we’re leaving the EU. It’s not just about Europe, we want to get out and be more in the world. Britain has a very important place in the world.” During the 2019 general election Clarke-Smith said that food banks in the UK were being used both as a \\"top up\\" and as a \\"political weapon\\", saying it was \\"simply not true\\" that Britain is \\"some kind of country in crisis and in absolute poverty\\". When he was challenged over his comments he said it was not true that \\"people can't afford to buy food on a regular basis\\". Following the election he was named by The Guardian as one of the seven \\"most controversial\\" new Conservative MPs. In December 2019, Clarke-Smith was reported to be one of the new members of the European Research Group.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury South since the 2019 general election. Background Christian Wakeford was born in Burnley, Lancashire, on 9 November 1984. Wakeford was elected as the MP for Bury South in 2019, winning the seat by 402 votes from long-term Labour MP, Ivan Lewis, who had held the seat since Labour's landslide victory in 1997. Lewis was standing as an Independent candidate at that election, but polled in fifth place with 1,366 votes. Prior to his successful election, Wakeford served as a Conservative Councillor for seven years, representing the Borough of Pendle Hill on the Lancashire County Council and serving as Lancashire Area Chairman for the Conservatives Party. Wakeford has a background in the communications and the insurance sector, working as an insurance broker and in telecoms. Wakeford served as a Governor of Colne Park High School for eight years. Political career Wakeford was elected as the Co-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Jews in July 2020. The APPG’s purpose is to promote understanding of the aspirations and challenges of the UK’s Jewish community, with topics including religious freedom, faith-based education, welfare and social justice, and to celebrate the culture, contribution and achievements of the UK’s Jewish community. Residential areas within Bury South, namely Prestwich and Whitefield, are home to one of the largest Jewish communities outside of London. Wakeford was elected to the Education Select Committee on 14 March 2020. He has since been involved in inquiries such as the impact of Covid-19 on education and children’s services, adult skills & lifelong learns, and left behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. Wakeford is a founding member of the International Parliamentary Network for Education (IPNEd), its priorities are to achieve higher total and better quality financing for education, ensure policy makers prioritize helping the furthest behind first and secure a focus on the quality of education and improved learning.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I4K-GrZBBQ&feature;=youtu.be Wakeford was also Chair of the Lancashire County Council Education Scrutiny Committee before stepping down in May 2020. Covid-19 and expenses controversy Wakeford came under fire in June 2020, when it was revealed he had failed to resign as county councillor for Pendle Hill ward of Lancashire County Council after his election to Parliament, a role which brings an annual allowance of £10,675. Wakeford's office claimed that the failure to stand down was due to the cancellation of local elections, caused by the Covid pandemic, though a fellow Councillor dismissed this excuse, citing a comparable case in Chorley Council, where an incumbent stepped down and no by-election was held, with other colleagues standing in. Prior to the Covid-19 Lockdown, but after his election to Westminster, Wakeford also served as Chair of the authority's education scrutiny committee, a position which attracts an additional allowance of £7,620. In June 2020, Wakeford's office confirmed he would be resigning from this role, some six months after his becoming an M.P.

He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Rother Valley since the 2019 general election. He is the first Conservative to ever be elected for the seat. Background Stafford grew up in Ealing Broadway, was privately educated at St Benedict's School, Ealing, and was part of the Ealing Youth Orchestra and Ealing Youth Choir. His mother was a magistrate and his father worked for a US technology company. His maternal grandmother was a Polish East German refugee, while his maternal grandfather was a Polish Ukrainian refugee who volunteered to serve in the British Army when the Soviet Union joined the Allies, having previously spent time imprisoned in a Siberian Gulag camp. Stafford studied History at St. Benet's, Oxford where he served as President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (in Michaelmas Term of 2007), as President of The Newman Society (in Hilary Term of 2006), and on the executive of the Oxford University Student Union. Before becoming an MP, Stafford worked for Shell, the World Wildlife Fund and Conservative MPs Andrew Rosindell and Owen Paterson. Political career Stafford's political career began when he was elected to Ealing Council in West London, where he has represented the ward of Ealing Broadway since 2014. In November 2019, he was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Rother Valley, a constituency to which he is tied by family in Dinnington. He was elected in the 2019 general election, becoming the first non-Labour MP to represent Rother Valley in the 101-year history of the constituency. Stafford is a member of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee. In August 2020, Stafford was criticised after it was revealed that he claimed expenses of 9p for a journey of less than a mile, one of seven mileage claims of less than £1 within the first four months of being elected. He also claimed £97 for a rail ticket for his wife from their home in London to his constituency. Political views Stafford campaigned to leave the European Union during the 2016 referendum. Stafford has previously named Margaret Thatcher as his political idol, who he believes \\"was a strong leader who saved the country from where it was headed. Right to buy gave everyone a stake in the country.\\" However, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stafford argued for the importance of a \\"green recovery\\" which would avoid mistakes made during the premiership of Thatcher: \\"In the 1980s under Thatcher, the closure of the coal mines, there was a cliff edge, a cut-off, that created lots of social problems and economic problems. We need to manage the transition better. We can’t leave anyone behind.\\" Stafford described himself as belonging to the political tribe of David Cameron and was a supporter of Cameron's Big Society policy \\"as things like Free Schools give power to local bodies. People know best how to run their own lives.\\" Personal life Stafford lives with his wife Natalie and their daughter Persephone Elizabeth Lilly Stafford, who was born on 23 April 2020.

Raised in North Lanarkshire, Bonnar served as an SNP councillor in the Thorniewood ward of North Lanarkshire from 2015 to 2020. He defeated the incumbent Labour MP Hugh Gaffney at the 2019 general election. He later resigned from his councillor role, stating he wanted to allow for a by-election to be called.  Early life  Bonnar grew up in Viewpark, North Lanarkshire, and was educated at St Gabriel’s Primary Viewpark and Cardinal Newman High School, Bellshill. He was employed as a security guard by British Home Stores, John Lewis & Partners and Debenhams Ireland.  Political career  Following the independence referendum, Bonnar decided to run for councillor in his local ward of Thorniewood. The previous SNP councillor, Duncan McShannon, had become very ill and had to vacate the seat after several months of sickness. On 9 July 2015, Bonnar won the by-election and was duly elected to serve as councillor for Thorniewood ward for North Lanarkshire Council. On 4 May 2017, Bonnar was again elected. During his time as a councillor, Bonnar was a witness for former SNP councillor Julie McAnulty in a successful defamation case in 2018, after she had been falsely accused by a party activist of making racist comments in a car trip with Bonnar. McAnulty was awarded £40,000 in damages. Bonnar stood for election for the Scottish National Party to become MP for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill at the 2019 general election. He became the third different MP in just over four years to represent the constituency, taking the seat from incumbent Labour MP, Hugh Gaffney. Bonnar received 22,680 votes, with a majority of 5,624, and Gaffney received 17,056 votes. The seat was one of six in Scotland gained from Labour by the SNP during the election. When swearing in to the House of Commons, he crossed his fingers to protest having to affirm allegiance to the monarchy. In February 2020, Bonnar made the decision to step down from his councillor role at North Lanarkshire council to allow a by-election to be called in Thorniewood in May 2020. In April 2020, a video emerged on a Rangers supporters Facebook group of Bonnar arguing with one of his neighbours. Bonnar had hung a Celtic F.C towel across one of his windows on the day that Celtic were declared SPFL title winners during the COVID-19 pandemic and was confronted by a neighbour. In the video, the neighbour asked Bonnar, \\"What's that about in your window...the Celtic flag?...is there any need?...you're supposed to be a councillor.\\" Bonnar responded angrily to the comment, saying: \\"What about it? I’m not a councillor. I’m a f***ing MP. Aye, it’s needed. What’s it got to do with you? It’s my house.\\" The neighbour then called Bonnar a \\"mug\\", to which Bonnar reacted \\"I'll take you down the park anytime you fucking want\\". Scotland was under lockdown due to the pandemic, with Bonnar stopping a few metres away from his neighbour, which seemed to stop any further escalation. Bonnar later argued he was decorating during the working week and it was to cover the window for a short period of time and he was \\"drawn into\\" the confrontation. The SNP offered an official apology on Bonnar's behalf: In May 2020, Police Scotland made further inquiries into the incident between Bonnar and his neighbour. On 14 May, they were both charged in connection with a street disturbance. A statement from Police Scotland stated it would be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.  Personal life  Bonnar lives in Viewpark, North Lanarkshire with his daughter.

It was narrated by Taylor Mali and is based on his poem “The Impotence of Proofreading”, with sound design by Normand Roger and Pierre Yves Drapeau, music by Pierre Yves Drapeau with Denis Chartrand and Normand Roger, text animation by Brian Kinkley, character design and animation by Don Flores and storyboards by Dan Schaeffer. Synopsis Missed AchesMissed Aches at the Internet Movie Database demonstrates how the shortcomings of spellcheck can result in unexpected double entendres. It combines animated characters with moving text and was written and narrated by poet Taylor Mali, who led teams to four championships in the National Poetry Slam (United States). The Black Maria Film Festival said: “This uproarious animation by one of the nation’s iconic animation artists colorfully serves up a cascade of malapropisms.” Process At the 2006 Wordstock Festival, Portland's big literary celebration, Priestley joined a sidebar workshop where two dozen people were waiting to hear Taylor Mali speak. Mali entered and performed the poem “ of Proofreading”. Priestley says: “The 70 something lady in a knit suit sitting next to me laughed so hard she fell off her chair. I immediately fell in love with this poem and desperately tried to connect with Mali after the reading but he was occupied by vending supervisors who would not allow him to sell his books. That same day, I found Mali’s email address online and sent him a message, following up with many more messages, drawings, videos and gifts. I must have worn him down, because over a year later I got a reply and our collaboration began. Taylor Mali was delightful to work with. He recorded a new version of the poem in his apartment, sent it to me and I used it to design the storyboard and timing for Missed Aches. I wanted to avoid illustrating the narration and created scenes that had some dissonance with the text but still related to it visually in several ways.” Priestley met filmmaker and compositor Brian Kinkleyhttps://kinkley.com/ after seeing his graduation film, The Dilemmahttps://kinkley.com/The-Dilemma-1 at the Art Institute of Portland. She immediately saw the possibilities of adding animated text to the backgrounds of Missed Aches and hired Kinkley to do the animation. They went on to collaborate on five more films: Eye Liner (2010),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2102317/?ref_=nm_flmg_anm_8 Split Ends (2013),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2799136/?ref_=nm_flmg_anm_3 Bottle Neck (2015),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4685410/?ref_=nm_flmg_anm_2 North of Blue (2018, feature),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7238370/?ref_=nm_flmg_anm_1 and Jung & Restless (2020). Soundtrack Priestley had always wanted to work with famed Canadian composer/sound designer Normand Roger, who spent 40 years creating soundtracks for the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal, Canada. She contacted his wife, filmmaker and National Film Board of Canada Executive Producer Marcy Page who was a friend and that paved the way for Priestley to collaborate with Normand Roger.

The New York Times best-selling book was published in 2016 by Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group and utilizes a series of exercises throughout its eleven chapters in order to provide others with a sense of structure in their lives. These creative and thought provoking exercises allow the reader to reflect on their life and determine what they should do with their future. They can then generate a road map and plan how to accomplish their goals.  About the authors  Bill Burnett is the current executive director of the Design Program at Stanford. He has a BS and MS in product design and has designed numerous products throughout his career. He obtained a design award for designing the first ever slate computer and also helps advise startups. He is also currently on the Board of VOZ. Dave Evans currently works alongside Burnett at the Design Program at Stanford. At a young age he worked at Apple where he helped design and market their first mouse. He then joined Electronic Arts as the first VP of Talent. In addition to co-writing Designing Your Life, he currently works with startups and non profit organizations.  Summary of chapters   Start Where You Are  The book asks the reader to reflect on four areas of life: health, work, play, and love, and to gauge each of them on a scale of 1-10. This self analysis is done in order for the reader to get a sense of what aspects of their life need the most (or least) attention. The book also promotes the idea of writing about each of these aspects in a journal.  Building a Compass  In this chapter, the book assumes the reader now has a good starting point and is ready to build a \\"compass\\" that will help guide them through life. The compass is made up of a workview and a lifeview. The workview revolves on what the reader's perceptions of work are and how important it is to them. The lifeview involves the philosophical questions of what gives life meaning. After assessing the workview and lifeview, the reader is on their way to creating their compass.  Wayfinding  This chapter includes the first real journaling exercise where the reader is asked to write down their day-to-day activities. They are then told to gauge them on engagement and energy. This is done in the hopes that the reader gains a sense of what activities are important to them and which ones seem unnecessary.  Getting Unstuck  This chapter places an emphasis on aiding those who feel stuck in life, whether it be an undesirable job or schoolwork. In order for the reader to find interest in life, the book proclaims that conducting a mind map for day- to-day activities along with the exercise from the chapter before it can help readers find activities that they may find more interesting.  Design Your Lives  Here the book encourages using the data that has been accumulated so far to conduct a plan for the future. This plan can be long or short term. The book once again proclaims the power of journaling and offers sample charts on how the reader should plan their future.  Prototyping  Now the book tells its readers to prototype their future plans. This means gathering information through experiences or conversations with others. This can help the reader realize what needs to be done in order for their future goals to become achieved.  How Not to Get a Job  Here the book shifts its focus from designing future plans to getting a good job. It provides some subtle tips and tricks that can make the reader more hire-able and appear more professional. It proclaims that when finding a job, one should focus on the needs of the employer instead of their own needs.  Designing Your Dream Job  The book acknowledges that not everyone may get their dream job, but that it is important to make good decisions that can lead something close to that dream job. Journaling once again advised in order for the reader to self reflect and realize what their dream job may be.  Choosing Happiness  The book explains to the reader that happiness does not necessarily mean having everything one could desire. It places an emphasis on getting rid of things that are not necessary. It also helps explain that one should not dwell on past mistakes or bad decision making and that they should instead focus on ways to improve their decision making abilities.  Failure Immunity  Failure is explained as something that is inevitable and that the reader must develop a form of \\"failure immunity\\" in order to embrace their mistakes and learn from them. It also recommends logging the reader's failures in their journal so that they can better remember them and think of a way to solve them.  Building a Team  This chapter emphasizes the importance of others. Friends and family are necessary when the reader is in times of need. The book tells the importance of teamwork in order to overcome the toughest of obstacles that may lie in one's way. Building a strong team is vital to success and happiness in life.  Conclusion - A Well-Designed Life  The book closes by explaining that the methods learned throughout the chapters will always be useful. It explains that even after retirement, it is still necessary for one to design their life in order to achieve maximum happiness and satisfaction. It then makes a comparison of life to a design project that constantly needs to be created.

He is the SNP member and spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee. Background Born in Belfast, Neale Hanvey was educated at Glenrothes High School before starting a twenty-five year career in the National Health Service. In 2005 he was appointed as divisional nurse director for rare cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital. He has been a contributing author to medical textbooks. Political career After returning to Scotland in 2012, Hanvey was elected as a Scottish National Party councillor in the 2012 Scottish local elections for the Dunfermline Central ward in Fife. During his time as a councillor, Hanvey was the SNP spokesperson for health and social care, SNP group convener, and latterly SNP group leader in 2017, but lost his seat at the 2017 local elections. In October 2019, he was selected as the SNP candidate for the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency at the 2019 general election.  Suspension and re-admission to the SNP  In November 2019, he was suspended from the party following allegations that he had made antisemitic social media posts two years earlier, in which he compared Israeli treatment of the Palestinians to the treatment of Jews during the Second World War and shared a newspaper article that included an image of George Soros that drew on an antisemitic trope. As a result, the SNP withdrew support for his campaign, but he remained as the party candidate on the ballot paper because the 14 November 2019 deadline for nominations had already passed. Hanvey accepted the suspension and apologised for the offending posts, stating that he was \\"genuinely and deeply sorry\\" and that \\"Although I do not in anyway consider myself anti-Semitic [sic], on reflection the language I used was, and this is clearly unacceptable.\\" Hanvey was elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath at the 2019 general election, gaining the seat from the Labour Party's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird by a majority of 1,243 votes. He sat as an independent MP upon his election. During his suspension from the SNP, Hanvey was advised by the Antisemitism Policy Trust (APT) and attended several APT activities in Parliament. He also met with the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities to apologise in person and thank them for their \\"generosity of spirit and willingness to help\\" during this time. In March 2020, the SNP's conduct committee agreed that Hanvey should be readmitted to the party in May 2020.. The SNP released a statement on 2 June to confirm that Hanvey’s six- month suspension from the party had ended on 27 May and that he would now join the SNP Westminster Group to sit as an SNP MP. On 2 July 2020 it was announced that Hanvey had been appointed as the SNP member and spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee.  Views  Hanvey has signed the SNP Women's Pledge, which originated amongst members of the SNP but is not affiliated with it. The pledge, which has been criticised as transphobic by some SNP members, opposes the Scottish National Party's proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act in Scotland which would allow transgender people to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate on the basis of a statutory declaration, rather than the existing Gender Recognition Panel system. Hanvey has said that he is supportive of trans rights, \\"but can’t accept that one group achieves equality by trampling the hard won rights & protections of another group\\", and said he is \\"frustrated that some refuse to see the risks of self ID despite the evidence it will be abused by sexual predators.\\" Challenged on these comments by the LGBT news organisation Pink Saltire, Hanvey said that women were not being heard on the issues of transgender rights.  Personal life  Hanvey is one of 45 openly LGBT MPs. He lives in Fife with his husband and two children.

It covers the topics of human trafficking, exploitation, and the impact that culture can play on individual relationships and the way society reacts to disparities and injustice.  Plot  The novel follows two narratives, one following the orphaned teenage sisters Ahalya and Sita, who formerly lived near the coast of Chennai with their family, and another following a lawyer named Thomas who lives in the United States. The siblings have decided to go live in a convent after a tsunami leaves them homeless and orphaned, however they are tricked by a friend of their dead father. Rather than take them to safety, he takes them to a trafficker who sells them to a brothel in Mumbai. Ahalya agrees to sleep with the clients at the brothel to protect her younger sister from having to suffer the same fate and she even allows the son of the brothel to sleep with her almost every night. Being disheartened and discouraged, there is one woman in the brothel who tells the sister that his is their karma and they need to accept it, not fight it. Meanwhile in the United States Thomas's life is at a low point in both his career and life. He and his wife Priya have divorced after the death of his firstborn to SIDs put a strain on his relationship with his ex-wife. He is walking in a park one day when he witnesses a kidnapping, he does his best to chance the kidnappers, but is unable to catch up and they get away. This, along with the state of his life, motivates him to take some time off of work and go to Mumbai to help out in an anti-exploitation organization, CASE. Back in India, the sisters are separated when Sita is purchased in order to transport drugs from India to France. She is forced to be a drug mule and swallow drugs wrapped in condoms and board a plane to Paris. Once there the drugs are retrieved and Sita is put to work without pay in a restaurant, the owners of the establishment treat her abysmally. During this Ahalya is rescued by Thomas and CASE after the organization discovers and raids the brothel, freeing the workers. Ahalya is sent to live in the convent and Thomas vows to find Sita. During his work he discovers that his ex-wife is in India, living with her family. He also manages to extract a confession from the brothel owner as to Sita's whereabouts and travels to Paris, only for Sita to be moved once again. This time she has been sent to a mansion and placed in forced domestic servitude to a family who mistreats her. She makes an unsuccessful attempt to flee, only for her to be recaptured and once again be trafficked. Thomas manages to track Sita to the wealthy family but only barely misses meeting her, as he catches a glimpse of her in a vehicle as it sped off. Performing further investigation, Thomas learns that Sita is being sent the United States and informs the FBI. Now in the United States, Sita has a difficult time adapting to American culture and to the demands forced upon her by her traffickers. She is forced to pose for porn but is able to avoid being raped by her captors. Her images are discovered on the dark web and the FBI manages to match Sita’s face to a picture. This time Thomas is able to successfully rescue Sita and reunite the two sisters. Thomas is also able to reconcile with Priya and the two remarry. By the book's end Thomas is continuing to work with CASE and is also expecting a child with Priya.  Development  Addison based the fictional institution of CASE on the human rights organization International Justice Mission (JIM). With the organization's help Addison was able to go undercover into brothels and other places of exploitation in India, where he saw injustice first hand. This inspired him to write the book, as he wanted to draw attention to the issues of modern-day slavery and human trafficking. In the afterword Addison states that raising awareness can help abolish modern slavery, as could financially supporting an abolitionist cause or using their skills to help combat human trafficking.  Publication  A Walk Across the Sun was first published in hardback on January 3, 2012 through SilverOak, alongside an ebook edition and audiobook narrated by Soneela Nankani. A mass-market paperback version was released in 2015.  Reception  Publishers Weekly and the New York Journal of Books reviewed the novel, the latter of which stated that \\"Providing a treasure chest of prose, culture, nuance, insight, despair, and hope, A Walk Across the Sun is the kind of literature that should be celebrated and honored.\\" The Christian Science Monitor also reviewed the work, criticizing the sub-plot of Thomas and Priya's marriage while praising Addison for his research on the slave trade and sexual trafficking. The Harvard Crimson was critical of the work, noting that while it was an \\"effective exploration of exploitation\\" the characters were all stock and the \\"coincidental events seem overly artificial and undermine the realism of experience.\\"  References  Category:2012 novels Category:Works about human trafficking Category:Works about sex trafficking ","title":"A Walk Across the Sun"},{"id":"62571658","text":"Ernest Ray Lane (March 16, 1931 – July 8, 2012) was an American blues pianist.

It is an antisense oligonucleotide drug of phorsphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry.  History  Golodirsen was developed by collaborative research led by Prof. Steve Wilton and Prof. Sue Fletcher in the Perron Institute and licensed to Sarepta Therapeutics by the University of Western Australia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved golodirsen in December 2019, under the accelerated approval pathway. The application for golodirsen was granted fast track designation, priority review designation, orphan drug designation, and a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. Mechanism of action Golodirsen has been provisionally approved for approximately 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. It works by inducing exon skipping in the dystrophin gene and thereby increasing the amount of dystrophin protein available to muscle fibers. Pharmacological features and side effects In the pivotal clinical trial of golodirsen, dystrophin levels increased, on average, from 0.10% of normal at baseline to 1.02% of normal after 48 weeks of treatment with the drug or longer. The change was a surrogate endpoint and the trial did not establish clinical benefit of the drug, including changes to the subject's motor function. The pharmacological assessment of golodirsen did not include special population groups, e.g., pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and patients with concurrent disease states. As DMD predominantly affects male children and young adults, and golodirsen is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients, but primarily not for adult women, the elderly, and patients with comorbidity, it was not evaluated on them. Following single or multiple intravenous infusions, the majority of drug elimination occurres within 24 hours of intravenous administration. The elimination half-life of golodirsen, in parity with eteplirsen was 3 to 6 hours. The most common side effects include headache, fever, fall, cough, vomiting, abdominal pain, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis) and nausea. In animal studies, no significant changes were seen in the male reproductive system of monkeys and mice following weekly subcutaneous administration. According to the reports obtained from the clinical trials, pain at the site of intravenous administration, back pain, oropharyngeal pain, sprain in ligaments, diarrhea, dizziness, contusion, flu, ear infection, rhinitis, skin abrasion, tachycardia, and constipation occurred at an elevated frequency in the treatment group, as compared to their placebo counterparts. Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, fever, itching, hives, skin irritation (dermatitis) and skin peeling (exfoliation), have occurred in people who were treated with golodirsen. Renal toxicity was observed in animals who received golodirsen. Although renal toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with golodirsen, potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Renal function should be monitored in those taking golodirsen. Clinical benefits As a first-generation drug, golodirsen is far away from being curative; clinical trial outcomes have demonstrated the drug to have a marginal effect on ameliorating DMD pathology. As of December 2019, golodirsen is approved for therapeutic use in the United States, as well as in the countries that automatically recognize the decisions of the US Food and Drug Administration, under the condition that its benefit will be demonstrated in a confirmatory clinical trial.  Medical uses  Golodirsen is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in pediatric patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.  Patient-focused perspectives Golodirsen is one of the very few FDA-approved exon-skipping therapy for DMD, although the clinical benefits of the drug are yet to established. While the development of golodirsen needed huge financing, it is only applicable to a small subset of DMD patients. Sarepta Therapeutics has announced that golodirsen will cost in parity with eteplirsen, another drug of a similar kind, which may be as high as 300K USD a year. Whether the patients should spend so much on a drug with questioned efficacy raises concerns. Also, the accelerated approval of golodirsen has paved the way for the patients to have early access to the drug, at the same time, it shrouded with controversy over a number of issues. A double-blind placebo-controlled confirmatory trial (NCT02500381) is ongoing to resolve the issues.

Earlier in his career, Hunt was also involved in East Anglian politics: between 2011 and 2017, he was a councillor on East Cambridgeshire District Council. Following the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough devolution deal, Hunt also worked as the Chief of Staff to the elected Mayor of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority.  Early life  Hunt was born and raised in Ely, Cambridgeshire. His father is a long-serving councillor on Cambridgeshire County Council and East Cambridgeshire District Council. Hunt attended school at King's Ely and Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge. He went on to study at the University of Manchester and Oxford University. Political career  Local and regional government  In 2011, Hunt was elected as a district councillor for Ely South in East Cambridgeshire. He served on East Cambridgeshire District Council until 2017. After working for Oliver Dowden MP and the Countryside Alliance, Hunt worked as chief of staff to the Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority. In July 2020, a government minister Simon Clarke criticised the appointment, saying that the legal advice behind it \\"contained significant omissions\\".https://www.elystandard.co.uk/news/metro-mayor-james-palmer- dismissive-of-criticism-by-government-minister-1-6752612 Some of the Combined Authority's priorities included construction of a metro system for Cambridge, upgrading the A47 in Cambridgeshire to dual carriageway, delivering Peterborough's first university with degree-awarding powers and building more affordable homes. None of these goals was achieved.  2019 general election  Hunt was selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Ipswich by the local ImConservative Association in September 2018.At the time, Hunt held a politically restricted post as Chief of Staff for Mayor James Palmer, making it unlawful for him to engage in any political activity. Despite this legal prohibition, Hunt continued to canvass for the Conservative Party in Ipswich until he was elected as an MP in December 2019. During the run up to the 2019 general election, Hunt said he would prioritise more investment in public services in Suffolk. This was to include more funding for Suffolk Constabulary to tackle county lines gangs and knife crime. He stated that Ipswich had not had a fair deal regarding police funding, and also called for tougher sentencing for those found guilty of serious crime. Hunt's also wants infrastructure upgrades. He has expressed his support for an Ipswich northern bypass, a solution to closures of Orwell Bridge due to high winds, in addition to better and more reliable rail services. Hunt was elected as the Member of Parliament for Ipswich on 12 December 2019, defeating the incumbent Labour MP Sandy Martin. He received 24,952 votes, a 50.3% vote share. Hunt identified Brexit and the unpopularity of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as issues behind the Conservatives' victory in Ipswich. He said being elected to represent Ipswich was the greatest honour of his life.  Member of Parliament for Ipswich  After his election to Parliament in 2019, Hunt said his priorities for Ipswich included anti-social behaviour (against), ensuring good hospital and GP services in the constituency (in favour), and seeking greater investment in roads and the rail network (in favour, if Suffolk). In his maiden speech, Hunt said that he had been diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia. He supports support of children with special educational needs. In January 2020 Hunt wrote in an article for the local East Anglian Daily Times newspaper on crime and anti-social behaviour in Ipswich that \\"It is impossible to start thinking about remedies to these issues without also being ready to confront the possibility that a disproportionate number of crimes are committed by individuals from certain communities. This is something we should be open and honest about. Brushing it under the carpet will not get us closer to solving the issue.\\" Hunt received largely positive messages from Ipswich residents in response to his article and his stand against minorities, although he was criticised in certain quarters. The Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality called his comments \\"at best disappointing and at worst an ill-judged piece of dogwhistling.\\" Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, Tim Passmore, referred to them as \\"very unhelpful\\".  Personal life  Hunt has lived in Ipswich since 2018. He is a Newcastle United fan, but he has naturally expressed an affinity for Ipswich Town, where he says he attends matches.

Business career  After leaving the army, Anderson worked in close protection for high-profile clients in the UK, Africa, and the Middle East, including Qatari Prime Minister Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani. He also ran security for US federal government officials in Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Anubis Associates  In 2005, Anderson co-founded Anubis Associates in Herefordshire. The company offered courses in close protection training, \\"operational protection\\" for corporate VIPs, and \\"discreet personal protection\\" and consultancy services for petrochemical groups, financial institutions and stadiums. Anubis Associates collapsed in 2012, owing £271,000 in unpaid tax. Administrators noted that Anderson, a director and major shareholder, had received £54,000 in illegal dividends \\"based on forecasted profits for a future period\\" that never materialised. Ordered to repay the money in full, Anderson only offered £2,000, arguing that he might otherwise go personally bankrupt.  eTravelSafety  Following the collapse of his previous company, Anderson founded another start-up based on personal security, eTravelSafety, of which he was \\"currently operating as CEO\\" at the time of the 2019 United Kingdom general election, according to his LinkedIn page. In December 2019 Private Eye reported that despite Anderson's professed enthusiasm for Brexit, his company had received £500,000 from the Midlands Engine Investment Fund, a government fund which receives its financial backing from the European Union, with £79 million coming from the European Development Fund and £123 million from the European Investment Bank. The article also noted that whatever the next government decides should happen to EU-funded programmes such as the Midlands Engine Investment Fund, eTravelSafety was now guaranteed its share of EU money. According to Anderson's entry in The Register of Members' Financial Interests, on 27 February 2020, his shareholding in eTravelSafety was not more than 15% and, on 18 May 2020, his shareholdings were no longer valued at more than £70,000.  Political career   Herefordshire Council  Anderson joined the Conservative Party in 2016. He was elected to Herefordshire Council in a by-election in October 2017, although he failed to attend almost half of his first 13 scheduled council meetings. He did not stand for re-election in May 2019.  House of Commons  Anderson was selected as the Conservative Party prospective parliamentary candidate for Wolverhampton South West in December 2018, and contested the 2019 UK general election as its candidate. He won the seat by 1,661 votes. Following the election he was named by The Guardian as one of the seven \\"most controversial\\" new Conservative MPs, due to his receipt of an illegal dividend as a director of a now defunct company. In January 2020, The Independent reported that Anderson's English Wikipedia page had been edited by an account named \\"Stuart Anderson MP\\" to remove potentially embarrassing material about the unlawful payments and the EU grant, as well as to make a minor correction about the directorship of one of his companies. Anderson is a member of the Defence Select Committee. During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Anderson criticised his government's imposition of tier 2 local lockdown measures on Wolverhampton, saying, \\"As a city we are unified in the view that we don't want these new measures, as we believe they are unfair and won’t make a difference\\". The new measures came into force as economic support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was being withdrawn by central government, and the government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) was reported to have \\"low confidence\\" that the local lockdown measures would prevent the spread of the virus (although they did recommend that the government impose a short \\"circuit-breaker\\" national lockdown).  Political positions  During the 2019 general election campaign, Anderson repeatedly pledged his support for Boris Johnson's Brexit withdrawal agreement and said he would support a no-deal Brexit if Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill were not passed. Anderson has never rebelled against the party whip, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. To date, the only exception was a free vote on a bill seeking to ban demonstrations outside abortion clinics, in which 56 Conservative MPs voted for the bill and 43 against, Anderson among them.  Personal life  Anderson is married and has five children. He is a member of the controversial evangelical Freedom Church,, and his former business eTravelSafety shares the same registered business address as Freedom Church Hereford.

Established in 2013, the team plays under the auspices of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA). It has been coached by Jason Nelms since its establishment. The Lady Movin' Mavs have won two National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT) national championships, in 2016 and 2018. Two of its players, Abby Dunkin and Rose Hollermann, have played for the United States Paralympic wheelchair basketball team. Two additional players of international note who have played for the Lady Movin' Mavs are Australian Annabelle Lindsay and Canadian Élodie Tessier.  History  The Lady Movin' Mavs were established in 2013. Jason Nelms was named its head coach. He previously played as a member of UTA's men's wheelchair basketball team, the Movin' Mavs, from 2000 to 2005 and also competed in three Paralympic Games. During its inaugural 2013–14 season, the team had no substitute players, instead playing all five of its players for the full 40 minutes of each game. The Lady Movin' Mavs played their first games against the University of Alabama and University of Illinois during a tournament in late October 2013. They also played in the National Wheelchair Basketball Association Tournament (NWBAT) in their first season, but were disqualified because one of their players fell sick before the tournament and the team could not field a five-player lineup. In April 2014, the team signed Rose Hollermann and Josie Aslakson in its first recruiting class. The Lady Movin' Mavs were initially a sports club at UTA and transitioned to full intercollegiate team status once sufficient funds had been raised. It plays under the auspices of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA), which organizes intercollegiate wheelchair basketball tournaments across the United States. During the 2014–15 season, the team's roster grew from five to nine players, which allowed the team greater flexibility with strategy and opportunities to rest players. That season, the team played in the National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT), where it lost to the University of Illinois in its first game and then lost to the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater in the third-place game. During the 2015–16 season, just the third season in the team's existence, it won its first national championship by beating the University of Alabama and then the University of Illinois in the NIWBT. The Lady Movin' Mavs finished with a 19–5 record on the season. That summer, it also had its first two players make the United States Paralympic wheelchair basketball team roster for the 2016 Summer Paralympics: Abby Dunkin and Rose Hollermann. The Lady Movin' Mavs finished the 2016–17 season with a 57–48 loss to the University of Alabama in the championship game of the NIWBT after they beat the University of Illinois 68–19 in their first- round game. Annabelle Lindsay with the Lady Movin' Mavs in 2019 During the 2017–18 season, the Lady Movin' Mavs recorded a perfect 20–0 season record. The team defeated the University of Alabama 65–55 in the NIWBT championship game to win its second national title. It was led by the play of veterans Dunkin, Hollermann, and Morgan Wood as well as Australian freshman Annabelle Lindsay. The Lady Movin' Mavs finished the 2018–19 season with an 82–76 overtime loss to the University of Alabama in the championship game of the NIWBT. In 2019, the team added Canadian freshman Élodie Tessier to its roster.

In blue, the current border between Oïl languages in the North, and Occitan and Franco-Provençal in the South. The von Wartburg line (or Nantes-Épinal line) is the name commonly given to a language border highlighted by Walther von Wartburg in his 1939 study, Die Entstehung der romanischen Völker (The origins of the Romance peoples). This line enables a distinction between the northern and southern varieties of Gallo-Romance languages in the 9th century. It was identified for the first time by Jakob Jud.Charles Parain, Le développement des forces productives en Gaule du Nord, Recherches Internationales à la Lumière du Marxisme, Issues 35 to 38, \\"Nouvelle Critique\\" Editions, 1963, .

For other linguists, the Vulgar Latin spoken in northern Gaul was already different before the Franks' arrival.According to R. Anthony Lodge: \\"the contact of Latin with the various indigenous (substrate) languages of Gaul, coupled with differential rates of romanisation, almost certainly meant that even before the Germanic invasions the Latin spoke in Gaul was not uniform.\\" French: From Dialect to Standard, R. Anthony Lodge, Psychology Press, 1993According to Jean-René Trochet, the von Wartburg line is the northern limit of ancient northern varieties of Occitan in the West and Franco-Provençal in the East. Aux origines de la France rurale, CNRS éditions, 1993, . With time, this line moved south until becoming the current border of Oïl languages, and Occitan and Franco-Provençal.  Geographical distribution  The von Wartburg starts from the mouth of the Loire, follows the river until the Sologne, before following the Loire again around Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire. From there, it continues north of the Morvan, leaving to the south a significant part of Burgundy and all of Franche-Comté before reaching the south of the Vosges.

According to the New York Times, items that sell well in such auctions are experiential items that cannot typically be bought in the store, including meetings with celebrities, Hawthorne, Fran (2011) For Charity, Bidding Access to the Starts—Even a Hug, New York Times, October 18, 2011, https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/business/charity-auctions-turn-to-what- cannot-be-bought.html an autographed guitar, and naming rights for characters in a forthcoming novel. Jacobs, Deborah (2008), Donations with Dividends, like Cruises and Puppies, https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/giving/11EVENTS.html In one notable example, Musician Eric Clapton sold 100 of his guitars in a charity auction in 1999 and raised $5 million for his substance abuse treatment facility. Engers, M., & McManus, B. (2007). Charity auctions. International Economic Review, 48(3), 953-994. In a charity auction the winning payment benefits a cause that is presumably valued by the bidder as well as competing bidders. Thus, the bidder receives a benefit from his own payment – both the item won and the value the donation supports the organization – and other bidders do as well, as their charity is supported. Therefore, bidders have two objectives that could be in conflict with one another: to win items that they value but also to support a charitable cause in part by driving up the price. This makes the charity auction a public good, and that means that bidders may be incentivized to lose. This introduces a free-rider problem. If the free-rider problem dominates, then bids and consequently auction revenues would be depressed. Haruvy, E., & Popkowski Leszczyc, P. (2015). The Loser’s Bliss in Auctions with Price Externality. Games, 6(3), 191-213. On the other hand, bids could rise because they are subsidized by charitable sentiment Engers, M., & McManus, B. (2007). Charity auctions.

Journal of Political Economy, 113(4), 897–918. has investigated the properties of different formats of charity auctions under the assumption that bidders care about the charity's revenue. The general result is that private benefits from charitable giving can translate into a “charity premium,” an increase I auction revenue resulting from charitable donations. In particular, altruism could play a role, and this altruism could very much depend on the proportion of the proceeds that is donated to charity.Haruvy, E., & Leszczyc, P. T. P. (2009).

Early life Farmar was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Thomas and Anne Farmar, a prominent family in New Jersey. He came from a very large family consisting of nine boys and three girls. As a young boy he was sent to England to become educated and returned to the American colonies around 1739. Upon returning he quickly began to rally support for Great Britain. Enlistment of men On April 16, 1740 New Jersey governor Lewis Morris issued a public proclamation in the local newspaper: Farmar and his father answered the call and began recruiting a company of men. On August 2, 1740 he submitted paperwork indicating that his company was full. However a subsequent inquiry found that his company was not complete and erroneously listed twelve men from another company. He was denied commission until he could prove that he recruited an entire company of men. A British officer was appointed to resolve the situation and ordered him to march his company to New Brunswick for inspection. He passed the inspection on August 8, 1740 and received his certified commission. West Indies After successfully recruiting his men he marched them south and waited for deployment. They arrived and boarded waiting vessels on September 30, 1740 but were delayed as more supplies were brought on board. On October 14, 1740 they set sail for Jamaica and arrived sometime in mid-November. Farmar received his captain's commission on January 10, 1741 as he fought alongside the British regulars across the West Indies until the war ended in 1748. Seven years war On May 28, 1761 Farmar received a letter from Charles Townshend: He was promoted to serve with the 34th Regiment of Foot under Lord Frederick Cavendish, the younger son of William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. Capture of Havana On March 5, 1762 the 34th Regiment of Foot sailed from England across the Atlantic and arrived at Havana a few months later on June 6. They immediately began fortifying the beachhead and erecting artillery batteries with defensive entrenchments. Early in the morning on July 22, 1762 the Spaniards launched a surprise attack against the position held by Farmar. He was fully prepared for the attack and immediately countered by sending 150 redcoats to defend the post. The surprise attack lasted a little over an hour and failed, costing the Spaniards 500-600 lives compared to the British loss of around 120 men. An engineer from the 34th Regiment named Archibald Robertson described the aftermath: The British had successfully defended the position and the artillery batteries were completely intact. A week later the batteries opened fire with an unending bombardment. The city surrendered on August 16, 1762. A few months later the Treaty of Paris was signed and Farmar was sent to Mobile, Alabama. Fort Charlotte Farmar arrived at Fort Condé on October 20, 1763 and immediately accepted the surrender of the fort. The fort was renamed Fort Charlotte in honor of Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. He declared that all of the inhabitants of West Florida were subjects of England and demanded that they take an oath of allegiance to the British Crown. Farmar served as an interim governor of Mobile for about a year and was succeeded by George Johnstone. Court martial Johnstone and Farmar did not get along. The disagreements escalated quickly and Farmar was accused of embezzlement and misuse of government funds. After a long trial that was held in Pensacola he was acquitted and sailed back to England. Upon returning he found that he had lost his commission and would not be serving as governor of the British West Florida colony. Mobile Farmar returned to Mobile to retire and join the planter class. He was elected to the General Assembly five times and served as a justice of the peace for three terms. Robert died on August 22, 1778 and was buried in Mobile, Alabama. A few years later the plantation was lost during the Battle of Fort Charlotte. His wife Mary Anderson Farmar sold most of the family assets and returned to Yorkshire, England.

Situated south of Houston, British Columbia, it rises 700 meters (2,300 ft) above the forested foothills of the rolling terrain of the Nechako Plateau, upon which it is the third highest peak. The peak is a striking feature on the surrounding landscape, and is theorized to have been a refugia during the last glacial period.BC Parks: Nadina Mountain Provincial Park A diverse community of lichen species grows on the summit plateau, but few vascular plants grow due to nutritionally poor soils from the granitic substrate. Vegetation below treeline consists mostly of subalpine fir. The mountain was established as a park in 2008 due in large part to its wildlife habitat status, especially for mountain goats. The park size is 2,789 hectares. The nearest higher peak is Mount Ney, to the southwest, and precipitation runoff from Nadina drains into tributaries of the Fraser River. Based on the Köppen climate classification, Nadina Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. History Located within Wetʼsuwetʼen First Nations traditional territory, Naydeena Mountain is a place where Wet’suwet’en people would go to hunt caribou, marmot, and mountain goat. This feature was labelled as \\"Na-di- na Mtn\\" on George Mercer Dawson's 1879 Geological Survey of Canada map where it first appeared. In the Babine-Witsuwitʼen language, Na-di-na means \\"standing up alone\\", a reference to its prominent, free-standing isolation. The mountain's name was officially adopted October 6, 1936, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The nearby Nadina River takes its name from the mountain.

It is found in the South-Central region, in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and with a single specimen tentatively identified from Missouri. Its natural habitat is in sandy prairies, saline and sodic barrens, and rock outcrops. Opuntia nemoralis has long been considered a synonym of Opuntia humifusa. However recent genetic analysis, in combination with distinct morphological features, suggested that recognition at the species level of many entities previously included under O. humifusa was warranted. In 2017 Opuntia nemoralis was resurrected as a species. Opuntia nemoralis is closely related to Opuntia cespitosa. O. nemoralis can be distinguished by its smaller size, narrower cladodes that more easily disarticulate, barbed spines, and tepals that are yellow (rarely faintly pink) to the base.

It will serve as the country's national stadium and will host Luxembourg's national football and rugby teams. It is to be listed as a Category 4 stadium by UEFA allowing it to host international matches. The stadium's original October 2019 target date for completion has been delayed due to slow construction progress, with its inaugural match now expected in 2021. Upon opening, it will replace the outdated Josy Barthel stadium, due for demolition. Design and construction The stadium's design was drawn up by local architectural firm Beng Architectes Associés in conjunction with the Hamburg based Gerkan, Marg and Partners, and selected from a total of 25 submissions by Luxembourg's Minister of Sport and the Mayor of Luxembourg City in September 2014. The final design and construction plans were approved by a unanimous vote of Luxembourg City councillors on 5 December 2016. Initial ground works on the stadium began in March 2017, with construction work commencing on 21 August 2017, and an official ground breaking ceremony in the presence of Mayor Lydie Polfer held on 18 September 2017. Works were due to be completed by October 2019, with an estimated cost, at the beginning of construction, of 61.1 million euros, with 40 million euros to be covered by the Ministry of Sport, and the rest by the Luxembourg City municipality. However, due to construction delays blamed on bad weather, the stadium's completion was put back until 2020. Construction costs were revised up to approximately 80 million euros, with the Luxembourg City administration paying for the overrun. In December 2019, Luxembourg City authorities said that work on the parking infrastructure for the stadium would only be able to commence in September 2020, and the stadium's inaugural match has been further delayed. Specifications Due to its location alongside the A6 motorway, the stadium is situated along an east-west axis, in place of the more traditional north-south axis used for stadia. The stadium is designed to hold a capacity of 9,386 spectators with fully covered seating for sporting events, and can hold up to 15,000 spectators for concerts. The main grandstand is situated along the south side of the field. To cope with its dual purpose as a football and rugby venue, as well as hosting occasional concerts, the stadium will be equipped with a hybrid grass playing surface. Public transit Upon the completion of Luxembourg City's new tramline at the end of 2021, the stadium will be served by the future Cloche d'Or tram terminus.

Upon his election, Gullis worked as a school teacher and head of year at Fairfax School in Sutton Coldfield and served as the school's trade union representative. On 30 April 2020, Gullis was criticised after he complained of the media's 'sick obsession' with the number of deaths during the coronavirus pandemic and called comparisons with the number of deaths in other countries 'lazy' in a now deleted tweet. He later apologised for his 'poor choice of words'. In June 2020, Gullis introduced a Ten Minute Rule bill which would introduce custodial sentences of up to 14 years for those who desecrate war memorials.

Since 2011, he has been heading the Supply Chain Management department at the University of Kassel.  Biography  Seuring studied among others business administration in Stuttgart and chemistry in Bayreuth and Bristol. He holds a Master of Science degree in chemistry from the University of Bristol, as well as a Master of Science degree in Business in the Environment from the University of Kent at Canterbury. He received his doctorate and habilitation from the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg. In 2004, he was a visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School.  Work  Seuring is considered to be an influential scientist, especially in the field of sustainability in supply chain management. An article written by Seuring and Martin Müller with over 70,000 hits is the most frequently accessed article written by Germans at ScienceDirect in the Physical Science category since 2005. Two further articles by Seuring are listed among the 100 most frequently accessed articles in the Social Sciences and Economics category. Seuring's name was also mentioned in the Handelsblatt Betriebswirte-Ranking 2012 and 2014, which lists the 250 most influential German-speaking business administration professors in terms of publication success (life's work). In 2016, Seuring was named in the list of the 27 most influential scientists in logistics and supply chain management drawn up by French scientists. The criterion for the inclusion was that the research work was considered to be globally trend-setting. Seuring is particularly honored for his research work at the interface of sustainability and supply chain management. The work was characterised by the fact that it did not take up individual aspects of the topic of sustainability, but rather developed an approach that places both environmental problems and social challenges equally in the focus of the management of global value chains. Seuring is the only German scientist on the list and one of only seven Europeans. In 2018 and 2019, he was named in the list of the Highly Cited Researchers by Clarivate Analytics, which lists 6,216 scientists worldwide whose scientific work is regarded as particularly influential. This was determined on the basis of publications listed in the Web of Science, which belong to the top 1% cited contributions in the respective research field.  Publications (selection)  * S.

It was released on December 13, 2019, as the second single from his second studio album Græ through Jagjaguwar. The song was written by Sumney with American singer-songwriter Tom Gallo. Sumney also solely produced the track. Composition The song was described by Elizabeth Aubrey of NME as a \\"gentle acoustic ballad\\". Lyrically, Marcus J. Moore of Entertainment Weekly stated the song \\"delves into the frustrations that arise in situationships\\" as Sumney \\"volleys between joy and sadness, satisfaction and restlessness\\". Grady Penna of Beats Per Minute observed that Sumney explored the dynamic of polyamory and unrequited affection through lines: \\"I want to be cotton candy / In the mouth of many a lover / Saccharine and slick technicolor / I'll dissolve\\". Sumney also \\"croons about giving himself an octopus hug, the downside of competing interests, and the desire to dance in time with another lover\\", as described by Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound. Tom Breihan of Stereogum interpreted the lyrics was about \\"a confused, ambiguous sexual relationship\\". Critical reception Upon its release, Pitchfork named it as the \\"Best New Track\\". Contributor Colin Lodewick connected the track to Sumney's 2017 single, \\"Doomed\\" in which Sumney questioned \\"whether it is okay not to feel love at all\\". While reviewing \\"Polly\\", Lodewick stated that the track \\"finds him finally full of love, but forced to contend with the truth that he's not loved equally in return\\". David Crone of AllMusic commended Sumney to sound \\"transcendent\\". \\"Polly\\" also was described as a \\"stunning intimate space\\" and was compared to the work of Bon Iver. While reviewing the associated album, Pitchfork's contributor Jayson Greene described the music as \\"devastating\\" and \\"resonant\\". \\"...exists only by the grace of his calloused hands fingerpicking a simple pattern and his voice, which does more to generate cosmos than all the prodigious talents on græ combined\\", Greene added. A.D. Amorosi of Variety called the song \\"folky\\", \\"open\\" and \\"humble\\". Amorosi further added: \\"[The song is] allowing Sumney to hold his notes [...] as if holding his breath while submersed in icy water\\". Music video The accompanying music video of \\"Polly\\" was released the same day as the track. It features Sumney cries as he stares into the camera, acting out and reacting to the lyrics. Jayson Greene of Pitchfork called the video as Sumney's \\"most exalted work\\". Live performances Sumney performed the song as a part of NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts session, released on August 10, 2020.

It is the third-largest lake in Aomori Prefecture, after Lake Towada and Lake Ogawara, with a shoreline of and a maximum depth of 3 meters. Etymology Per the Goshogawara city tourist bureau, the lagoon is called Lake Jusan because different rivers flow into it. However, other sources state that the name comes from the Ainu language word \\"To Sam\\", meaning the \\"shoreline of a lake\\". Hydrology The primary inflow to Lake Jūsan is the Iwaki River. Several small rivers also flow into the lagoon. The only outflow of the lagoon is to the Sea of Japan at the northwest corner of the lake, opposite to the mouth of the Iwaki River. Geology Lake Jūsan was formed after the end of a glacial period about 7,000 years ago. The retreating glaciers left behind sandy deposits that divided the estuary from the Sea of Japan. After five hundred years a lake had formed. However, the lake would be filled in by sediments deposited by the Iwaki River, causing the it to become more shallow and brackish. History A partially-rebuilt Fukushima Castle stands on the northern shore of the estuary. The primary source of the lagoon, the Iwaki River, supported numerous villages as early as the Jōmon period (14,000 - 300 BCE) as evidenced by numerous shell mounds. The river was revered as the \\"mother of the Tsugaru Plain\\" throughout its early history. The Iwaki River region, located in the vast northern Mutsu Province, did not come under the control of the central government until the late Heian period (794 - 1185) The Northern Fujiwara clan, based in Hiraizumi in present-day Iwate Prefecture, controlled the trade with the Asian continent and Hokkaido via the Port of Tosa, located on the western shore of the lake. Despite the loss of control of much of Japan later in the Heian period, the court maintained some level of military presence in Mutsu. This control ended when the Northern Fujiwara were conquered by Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147 - 1199) and clans of the Kantō region, and the Iwaki River region came under the direct control of the Kamakura shogunate. By the mid-Kamakura period the Andō clan ruled the area, and Fukushima Castle was built on the north shore of the lake. The Andō controlled trade with the Ainu via Tosaminato. Some records indicate that Port Tosa was destroyed in an enormous tsunami in 1340; however, historical records for this period are scarce and lack veracity. What is more certain is that the Andō were defeated by the Nanbu clan in 1442, and the port fell rapidly into disuse after that date. During the Edo period, the port was rebuilt as the point where rice harvested in the Hirosaki Domain was exported to the Osaka, but it never regained its former prosperity and fell into disrepair again after the proliferation of railroads during the Meiji period. The ruins of Port Tosa are preserved today as a National Historic Site. The folk song and dance pays tribute to the lagoon and the port. Economically, Lake Jūsan is noted today for its production of shijimi clams.

Macau independence is the proposition that supports independence of Macau from the People's Republic of China. Despite receiving little attention within Macau, the issue was raised in the Legislative Council following the Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy. In 2017, several Chinese media outlets warned against discussion of Macau independence, fearing that speculation would lead to further action.  Background  Fragments of pottery found in Coloane. An early map of Macau produced in 1639. The Portuguese colony of Macau was established in 1557, initially in exchange for 500 taels (approx. 20 kg) of silver per year. In 1845, Queen Maria declared that Macau was to become a free port, in response the nearby Hong Kong being established as such and threatening the economic activity of Macau. At this time, the government of Macau also became more hostile to the Qing offices established in the area and began a campaign of removing them and expanding the territory of the colony. By 1889, the territory of Macau had been expanded to roughly its current size. In 1887, the Chinese government was forced to sign the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking which, among other concessions, recognised a permanent settlement of Macau by the Portuguese in exchange for Portugal agreeing to not cede the territory to another power without China's consent. On 3 December 1966, the 12-3 incident broke out which consisted largely of anti-colonial protests by the residents of Macau. The incident erupted after corrupt colonial officials blocked the already approved construction of a private school for Chinese students on Taipa island as they had not received a bribe. Police suppression of the ensuing protests led many in Macau to turn against the colonial government, supported by the communist government in China. The subsequent turmoil, involving blockades by the Chinese military, forced the Portuguese to make a number of concessions to the protesters, including expanding the role of China in the governing of Macau, the payment of reparations to the Chinese community, as well as ceding effective control of the colony to the Communist Party of China through local proxies. In 1975, the Portuguese offered to return Macau to China. However, as the Cultural Revolution was still wreaking havoc on the mainland, the CCP refused to take back the colony. On 13 April 1987, the governments of Portugal and China signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau to lay out the terms of the handover of Macau to the PRC. The date for the handover was set at 20 December 1999.1553、1849澳門歷史上兩個值得重視的年份——從《基本法·序言》16字概括談起 , 1994年1月“澳門歷史文化國際學術研討会”論文  Ideology  Much discussion has been had, particularly by former University of Macao scholar Chou Kwok Ping, comparing the histories of Macau and Hong Kong. Chou notes that while the events of the 1960s in Hong Kong (particularly the Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots) led those in Hong Kong to distrust the communist government in China, the fact that China supported the movements against the Portuguese government in Macau and was successful has led Macanese to look more favorably on China, and their relationship with it. This has also meant that there is a far less strong sense of local identity in Macau compared with Hong Kong. The effective loss of control by the colonial government in Macau also led to political stagnation in the colony following the 12-3 incident, while the effectiveness of the Hong Kong government in quelling the riots allowed it to continue to develop. Macau also has a less developed sense of civil society compared to Hong Kong. Unlike its neighbour, Macau generally lacks effective civil organisations, rights groups, or a truly free press. Likewise, Macanese universities often follow political trends and there is far less protection of academic freedom. Citizens of Macau, when polled by the University of Hong Kong's Public Opinion Programme, identified significantly more strongly as \\"Chinese\\" than did their counterparts in Hong Kong.  Current situation  The Swedish magazine The Perspective speculated that the relative lack of independence sentiment in Macau stems from the SAR's reliance on gaming and tourism revenue from the Mainland. Macau is currently one of the richest regions in the world, and its wealth is derived almost entirely from gambling, which is illegal in the PRC.  Events   2016 legislative controversy  In 2016, following an interpretation of the Hong Kong Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the People's Republic of China, the Macau SAR government issued a requirement of all legislators to swear allegiance to the Macao Basic Law. The law also allows for the barring of potential candidates on the basis of their stated positions on issues which the government deems not in keeping with this principle. In an editorial in Jornal Informação (Son Pou), the policies of the Macau SAR government were lambasted for using unrest in neighbouring Hong Kong as an excuse for its own poor policies, suggesting that the government is ineffective owing to the lack of an engaged populace which will ultimately lead to growing resentment among the populace. The article also suggested that while public sentiment towards Macau Independence is largely non-existent, it is likely to grow the more the SAR government raises the issue, particularly as this is often done to cover apparent failures over livelihood issues.  2017 press storm  2017 Legislative Council election posters. An editorial in the Global Times, a subsidiary of the People's Daily, warned that 'radical elements' were attempting to bring Hong Kong-style unrest to Macau and were promoting independence for the SAR. The article focused on a candidate in the 2017 Legislative Council elections, Sulu Sou Ka Hou, who was running as a pro-democracy candidate. Following his election, Sou stated in a radio interview that 'independence' was used as a smear by more conservative members of society. He also noted that terms such as 'patriotism' were often misused by those in power to refer to loyalty to the ruling authority for personal gain, rather than any genuine feeling towards the country.

The woolly monkey hepatitis B virus (WMHBV) is a viral species of the Orthohepadnavirus genus of the Hepadnaviridae family. Its natural host is the woolly monkey (Lagothrix), an inhabitant of South America categorized as a New World primate. WMHBV, like other hepatitis viruses, infects the hepatocytes, or liver cells, of its host organism. It can cause hepatitis, liver necrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). Because nearly all species of Lagothrix are threatened or endangered, researching and developing a vaccine and/or treatment for WMHBV is important for the protection of the whole woolly monkey genus. WMHBV is also of great interest to researchers because of its potential to teach us more about the human hepatitis B virus (HBV). WMHBV is a distant phylogenetic sister species to human HBV, although the evolutionary history of hepatitis B viruses is not well understood. Additionally, WMHBV was the first hepadnavirus other than human HBV that was known to infect non-human primates. The discovery of WMHBV opened up the possibility of developing a primate model for HBV, since prior, most hepatitis B research was done with duck or woodchuck models. Since the discovery of WMHBV, another primate- infecting hepadnavirus has been discovered: capuchin monkey hepatitis B virus (CMHBV). Both CMHBV and WMHBV have potential to play an important role in the development of human hepatitis B treatments.  Isolation  Woolly monkey hepatitis B virus was isolated in 1998 from serum samples of a brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagotricha) that was suffering from fulminant hepatitis at the Louisville Zoo. Discovery of this pathogen was extremely concerning because the Louisville Zoo was home to a very successful woolly monkey breeding program. They immediately tested all sixteen members of their woolly monkey colony and found that nine were chronically infected with the virus, and another four showed signs of previously having the virus, which was identifiable via presence serum antibodies to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Thus, thirteen out of the sixteen woolly monkeys appeared to have been exposed to the virus. Analysis of archived woolly monkey sera at the Louisville Zoo suggested that the WMHBV was present in the colony for at least nine years before its discovery. Eighteen other woolly monkeys from four zoos across the country were tested for WMHBV, and the results came back negative.  Morphology   Genome  A member of the Hepadnaviridae family, WMHBV has a partially double-stranded, partially single-stranded circular DNA genome. Its genome is 3,179 nucleotides in length, and encodes 5 proteins: the capsid (core) protein, the large envelope protein (L glycoprotein), the external core antigen, protein P (polymerase), and protein x (multifunctional protein). The polymerase open reading frame (ORF) is the largest ORF in the genome, and has significant overlap with each of the other genes, perhaps constraining its evolutionary properties. Although WMHBV is considerably divergent from the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), they share the same genetic organization. The core gene of WMHBV was the most similar to human HBV with 85.8-86.9% similarity at the amino acid level, while the WHMBV X gene was most divergent from human HBV with only 64.3-65.6% similarity at the amino acid level.  Structure  Woolly monkey hepatitis B virus is similar in structure to other Orthohepadnaviridae. Mature virions are enveloped, and consist of an icosahedral capsid. The majority of virions consist of 240 capsid proteins and display T=4 symmetry, however, a small amount of virions consist of 180 capsid proteins and display T=3 symmetry. The envelope surrounding the capsid is derived from the host membrane. L glycoproteins line the surface of the envelope and play a role in viral attachment to cell receptors. The virions are small, approximately 42 nm in diameter.  Replication cycle   Entry into cell  It has been found that sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a sodium/bile acid symporter found in the cellular membrane of hepatocytes, acts as a cellular receptor for WMHBV, as well as many other hepadnaviruses. Following attachment to the NTCP, WMHBV enters into the cell cytoplasm via endocytosis, and the large envelope protein ensures fusion between the endosomal membrane and the viral membrane.  Replication and transcription  Replication and transcription of the WMHBV has not been extensively studied, but is believed to occur very similarly to all other HBV including human HBV. Once inside the cell, nuclear localization signals on the capsid protein allow the capsid to bind to importin α-importin β complexes. The genome is released from the capsid at the nuclear pore complex, and enters into the nucleus. Inside, the viral polymerase protein is released and ligates the DNA so that it becomes covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA. The cccDNA then binds nucleosomes and acts as the host DNA. The cccDNA is then transcribed to RNA via host cell RNA polymerase. Many RNAs are shipped to the cytoplasm where the proteins are assembled, including a large number of empty capsids. Reverse transcription by the viral polymerase protein re-creates the relaxed, partially double-stranded circular DNA genome.  Assembly and release  The relaxed, partially double-stranded circular DNA genome is able to diffuse into an empty capsid through large pores in the capsid. The capsid is then enveloped and exported from the cell through a process that is not yet well understood.  Health effects  Chronic infections of WMHBV can go long periods of time before symptoms arise, especially when the woolly monkey is infected at birth. Chronic infections usually progress to liver issues which are often deadly. Woolly monkey autopsy reports from 1974 to 1998 noted hepatitis (liver inflammation), and liver necrosis (sudden liver failure) as two pathologies likely to be linked to WMHBV. Other probable complications of chronic WMHBV infection include cirrhosis (scarring damage of the liver), and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), among other liver diseases. Chronic infections not only lead to health issues, but also allow for viral transmission. Chronically infected woolly monkeys have the virus actively replicating in their body, causing the virus to be transmissible in the monkey's bodily fluids.  Transmission  Woolly monkey hepatitis B virus, like other hepatitis B viruses, is transmitted through bodily fluids, and from a mother to her fetus. The vertical transmission of WMHBV from mother to fetus is often the most detrimental, because similar to human HBV, age of infection is highly correlated to the risk of developing a chronic infection. Woolly monkeys infected with WMHBV at birth have around a 90% chance of developing a chronic infection, while those infected in adulthood have only a 5-10% chance of developing a chronic infection.  Research advances   Developing a HBV animal model  Since woolly monkeys are endangered, they cannot be used as an HBV animal model for research. Therefore, they are seeking out other primates that may be able to be infected by WMHBV. The woolly monkey's close relative, the black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) is susceptible to infection by WMHBV, but does not display levels of viral replication as high as woolly monkeys. Researchers were able to create an infectious clone of WMHBV, coined WMHBV-2, that infects and replicates in black-handed spider monkeys to the same degree that WMHBV replicates in woolly monkeys. This infectious clone will allow for greater research of hepatitis B virus treatments on a primate model.

Education  Patrick Mehlen, a former student at the École normale supérieure de Lyon, defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Claude-Bernard University in 1995. From 1997 to 1998 he spent two sabbatical years at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research, program on \\"Aging and Cell Death\\" - Pr. D.E. Bredesen. Back in France, he became head of the \\"Apoptosis and Differentiation\\" group in the laboratory - CNRS UMR5534, CGMC until 2004. Then he became director of the \\"Apoptosis, Cancer and Development\\" research unit - CNRS FRE2870 then UMR5238 at the Léon Bérard Centre until 2011. He joined the Lyon Cancer Research Centre, where he became the director in 2019. He is also Director of Translational Research and Innovation at the Léon Bérard Centre since 2013, Director of the DEVweCAN Laboratory of Excellence since 2011 and Director of the Rabelais Institute for Interdisciplinary Cancer Research (Convergence Institute) since 2018.  Research  Patrick Mehlen was one of the discoverers of the addictive receptor paradigm: from an original mechanism of cell death to clinical trials; explained below and which constitutes the presentation of his scientific work. A few years ago, an original concept of cell biology was proposed: while classical dogma assumed that transmembrane receptors are inactive unless bound by their specific ligand, it was proposed that some receptors could be active not only in the presence of their ligand, but also in their absence. In the latter case, the downstream signalling of these unbound receptors leads to programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. These receptors have therefore been called \\"dependent receptors\\" because their presence on the cell surface makes the cell's survival dependent on the presence in the cell environment of its respective ligand.Mehlen P. et al., « The DCC gene product induces apoptosis by a mechanism requiring receptor proteolysis », Nature, 1998 To date, Mehlen and his collaborators have identified or participated in the identification of the most well known dependent receptors. Beyond the fundamental interest of studying a receptor capable of transducing two antagonistic signals - a \\"positive\\" one in the presence of ligands leading to cell differentiation, proliferation or migration and a \\"negative\\" one in the absence of ligands leading to cell suicide, they proposed that this dual function could lead these receptors to play a key role both during embryonic development and in regulating tumorigenesis. In the context of their involvement in embryonic development, they hypothesized that the pro-apoptotic activity of these dependence receptors is crucial for the development of the nervous system as a mechanism \\"allowing\\" neural guidance, migration or localization in ligand situations. Thus, they found that the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) Patched receptor is a dependency receptor and that its ability to induce apoptosis in the absence of Shh is essential for adequate neural tube development.Thibert et al., « Inhibition of neuroepithelial patched-induced apoptosis by sonic hedgehog », Science, 2003Mille et al., « The Patched dependence receptor triggers apoptosis through a DRAL-caspase-9 complex. », Nat Cell. Biol, 2009 They also showed that the receptors of netrin-1 DCC and UNC5H regulate the death/survival of specific neurons during the development of the nervous system.Furne et al., « Netrin-1 is a survival factor during commissural neuron navigation », PNAS, 2008Tang et al., « Netrin-1 Mediates Neuronal Survival Through PIKE-L Interaction With the Dependence Receptor UNC5B », Nat. Cell. Biol, 2008 This involvement is not limited to the developing nervous system, as they have shown the importance of UNC5H-induced apoptosis in the formation of blood vessels - angiogenesis.Castets et al., « Inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis by netrin-1 during angiogenesis », Dev Cell, 2009Guenebeaud et al., « The dependence receptor UNC5H2 triggers apoptosis via PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of DAP kinase », Mol Cell, 2010 In the context of cancer, they hypothesized that these receptors are tumor suppressors that would limit cancer progressionMazelin et al., « Netrin-1 controls colorectal tumorigenesis by regulating apoptosis », Nature, 2004 by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells outside the territories of ligand accessibility/availability.Mehlen et Puisieux, « Metastasis: a question of life or death. », Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2006Mehlen al., « Novel roles for Slits and netrins: axon guidance cues as anti-cancer targets? », Nat Rev. Cancer, 2011 They were particularly interested in receptors that bind to the netrin-1 ligand -i.e., DCC and UNC5H-. They have shown that DCC and UNC5H are all dependency receptors in cancer cells: whereas in the presence of their netrin-1 ligand, they transduce classical \\"positive\\" signals, in the absence of netrin-1, they actively trigger apoptosis.Mehlen et al., « The DCC gene product induces apoptosis by a mechanism requiring receptor proteolysis », Nature, 1998Corset et al., « Netrin-1 induced growth cone attraction and cAMP production is mediated via interaction with the Adenosine A2b receptor », Nature, 2000Forcet et al., « DCC-dependent MAPK activation is required for netrin-1 mediated axon outgrowth », Nature, 2002Llambi et al., « Netrin-1 acts as a survival factor via its receptors UNC5H and DCC », EMBO J, 2001Llambi et al., « The dependence receptor UNC5H2 mediates apoptosis through DAP kinase », EMBO J, 2005Guenbeaud et al., « The dependence receptor UNC5H2 triggers apoptosis via PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of DAP kinase », Mol Cell, 2009Dominici et al., « Floor- plate-derived netrin-1 is dispensable for commissural axon guidance », Nature, 2017 Interestingly, DCC and UNC5H are considered tumor suppressors because their expression is lost in many cancersMehlen et Gibert, « Dependence receptors and cancer: addiction to trophic ligands », Cancer Res, 2015Thiebault et al., « The netrin-1 receptors UNC5H are putative tumor suppressors controlling cell death commitment », PNAS, 2003 suggesting that the presence of these receptors is a constraint to tumor progression. This has in fact been formally proven by showing that in mice, the invalidation of UNC5H3, the overexpression of netrin-1 in the digestive tract or the specific inactivation of pro-apoptotic DCC activity similarly caused cancer progression.Bernet et al., « Inactivation of the UNC5C Netrin-1 receptor is associated with tumor progression in colorectal malignancies », Gastroentérologie, 2007Castets et al., « DCC constrains tumor progression via its dependence receptor activity », Nature, 2012 Thus, aggressive cancers that develop are cancers for which tumor cells block the pathways of dependent receptorsFitamant et al., « Netrin-1 expression confers a selective advantage for tumor cell survival in metastatic breast cancer », PNAS, 2008Delloye et al., « Interference with Netrin-1 and Tumor Cell Death in Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer », JNCI, 2009aDelloye et al., « Netrin-1 acts as a survival factor for aggressive neuroblastoma », JEM, 2009bBroutier et al., « Targeting netrin-1/DCC interaction in Diffuse Large-B and Mantle Cell Lymphoma », EMBO MM, 2016 and a mechanism for this inactivation of this cell death pathway is that tumor cells acquire an autocrine secretion of netrin-1. These researchers then showed that an agent blocking the interaction between netrin-1 and its receptors allowed in vitro to lead to the death of tumor cells and in animals to control tumor progression. With this in mind, they have generated a drug candidate - anti-netrin-1/NP137 antibody - which is currently being tested in patients with very advanced cancers with very encouraging signs of clinical activity.

Life Christa Mulack was born and grew up in Hamburg. She studied Theology, Psychology, Sociology and Teaching sciences. While working as a teacher at a Gymnasium (secondary school) she received her doctorate in 1982 from the University of Dortmund (as it was known at that time). Her dissertation, entitled \\"Die Weiblichkeit Gottes\\" (loosely, \\"God's Womanhood\\"), was published as a book in 1983, and established Mulack's reputation as a feminist theologian. The topic is one on which she has worked as a freelance author and teacher at several universities and theological academies since 1984. Works Her next significant publications were \\"Maria – die geheime Göttin im Christentum\\" (\\"Maria - Christianity's secret goddess\\") in 1985 and \\"Jesus – der Gesalbte der Frauen\\" (loosely, \\"Jesus - Anointed by women\\") in 1987. She based her selection of theoretical methodical analytical devices on the gender typologies identified by Carl Jung and on the Kabbalah.Meret Fehlmann: Die Rede vom Matriarchat. Zur Gebrauchsgeschichte eines Arguments. Zürich 2011, , pp. 243-245 In her work Mulack tries to liberate biblical texts from the powerful patriarchal gloss of the last two thousand years. She retains the Christian symbols, but wants to reform Christianity in a feminist way and reinstate a matriarchy that traces its origins back to earlier traditions. Under Mulack's model Jesus becomes the prototype of spiritually integrated men and matriarchal societies, positioned at the interface between patriarchy and matriarchy:Helga Laugsch: Der Matriarchat-Diskurs (in) der Zweiten Deutschen Frauenbewegung, München 2011, , pp. 182–186. With this restitution of the image of the mother and her beloved son, which over the ages flows through all religions, Jesus reconnects with the matriarchal world in which revelation was fashioned\\". Christa Mulack: Die Weiblichkeit Gottes. 1983, S. 91 Applying this prism, Mulack sees Jesus as the one anointed by women, with Mary Magdalene as the goddess figure and Jesus as her \\"beloved son\\". Under this reading, there are clear parallels between the \\"anointing stories\\" in the New Testament at the rituals around the \\"Great Mother\\" and related hero figures, as identified by Heide Göttner-Abendroth as the core element of matriarchal religions. Mulack's 1993 book \\"… und wieder fühle ich mich schuldig\\" (\\"… and I'm feeling guilty again\\") moves away from themes relating directly to \\"God's Womanhood\\", and deals with feelings of guilt which, the author asserts, are typically found in women. She imputes social causes to the problem.Christa Mulack: … und wieder fühle ich mich schuldig. Ursache und Lösung eines weiblichen Problems, Kreuz-Verlag, Erstaufl. 1993, . Her 2006 book \\"Klara Hitler – Muttersein im Patriarchat\\" (loosely \\"Klara Hitler - Being a mother in the patriarchate\\"), describes the patriarchal family as the \\"stirrup holder of the Third Reich\\" , and Klara Hitler as the archetypical patriarchal mother.

Initially the ministers were largely identical to those at the end of the first Johnson ministry, but changed significantly in February 2020. History The Conservative minority first Johnson ministry, which came to power following the resignation of Prime Minister Theresa May in July 2019, could not implement its legislative programme due to a political impasse over Brexit. While the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 requires a two-thirds majority vote in parliament to trigger an election, Johnson bypassed this requirement by passing the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019. In the resulting election, held on 12 December 2019, Johnson's Conservatives won a majority of eighty seats, the largest for a government led by a Conservative prime minister since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Initially the ministers were largely identical to those at the end of the first Johnson ministry, excepting the Secretary of State for Wales, in which position Simon Hart replaced Alun Cairns. Nicky Morgan, who stood down at the general election, and Zac Goldsmith, who lost his seat, were made life peers to allow them to remain in the government. Johnson reshuffled his cabinet on 13 February 2020: Sajid Javid, Julian Smith, Esther McVey, Geoffrey Cox, Andrea Leadsom, Theresa Villiers and Chris Skidmore all left the government. Andrew Sabisky worked as a political adviser in Johnson's office for a short time in February. Sabisky, a speaker at the secretly held London Conference on Intelligence at UCL in 2015, believed that there were significant differences in average intelligence between different races, and supported enforced contraception. This caused concern among politicians of all parties in the UK Parliament only a few days after Sabisky's appointment. He resigned from his advisory role on 17 February 2020. On 17 March 2020, Johnson announced in a daily news conference that the government \\"must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy\\". This is in regards to the current coronavirus pandemic, which will effectively change how his ministry operates for the foreseeable future.

According to the 2011 census, the population of Mankidia was 2,222. They are classified as a Scheduled Tribe by the Indian government. Origins The Mankidia are an ethnic offshoot of the Birhor Tribe. They specialize in catching monkeys (called Mankada in Odia), hence their name was derived from the name that neighboring tribes called them. People believe that their origin is from Chota Nagpur Plateau. They might have migrated to different parts of Odisha and finally settled in the hilly areas.  Culture  The Mankidia are a semi-nomadic hunter/gatherer community. Traditionally skilled in rope making, catching, and hunting of monkeys, they are often employed by local people to drive away invasive monkeys in rural areas. They move around forests in small bands and stay at different temporary makeshift settlements called tanda/tandia. The tandia comprises a temporary dome-shaped leaf hut known as Kumbhas. They speak a form of Mundari language, and some can also speak Odia. Each Tandia is headed by a religious head man called Dehury. The Dehury has an assistant called Naya. The Mankidia people's religious beliefs are polytheistic. They believe in many malevolent and benevolent spirits and gods. Their supreme deities are Logobir and Budhimai. They also worship their ancestors for good health and success in hunting and harvesting forest produce. Besides hunting they also engage in making baskets and ropes out of Siali fiber, Sabai grass and Jute, as well as making disposable plates made out of leaves called Khali.

Career before Parliament Mullan worked in national health policy as a lobbyist and as a junior doctor in A&E.; In his role as policy director of the Patients Association, Mullan was a vocal critic of NHS care standards, claiming that the organisation \\"must stop hiding behind complex bureaucracy\\" when mistakes were made regarding NHS patients. He has written about education issues for ConservativeHome and BrexitCentral. He also founded ValueYou, a volunteer recognition scheme in Ealing.Class of 2019: Meet the new MPs, Politics Home. Accessed: 26 April 2020. In March 2020, Mullan volunteered in a local hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Political career Mullan unsuccessfully contested elections for two seats in the Midlands: Birmingham Hodge Hill in 2015, and Wolverhampton South East in 2017. He was selected as the Conservative candidate for the Crewe and Nantwich seat in September 2018, and benefited from pro-Brexit sentiment in the run-up to the December 2019 election. He won what had previously been a marginal seat, defeating the incumbent Labour Party MP Laura Smith, by 8,508 votes. In June 2020, Mullan vowed to work with Bentley workers and unions after 1,000 job losses were announced at the company's Crewe factory. Bentley chief executive Adrian Hallmark, warned that a no-deal Brexit could “compound the coronavirus disaster” and pleaded with MPs who support an \\"uncontrolled\\" exit from the EU that this policy would lead to further job losses, urging politicians: \\"please don’t push us off a second cliff.” On 24 June 2020, Mullan voted against the weekly testing of NHS and social care staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite promising to “speak up for, and work for, staff” at the NHS during the election victory speech he gave six months earlier. In July 2020, Mullan voted against New Clause 17, which intended to protect the NHS and publicly funded health and care services in other parts of the UK from any form of control from outside the UK in a future post-Brexit trade deal. In August 2020, Mullan vowed to fight any attempt to expand a controversial Muller development in Nantwich that had been given the go ahead by the Government. Yet days later, a Freedom of Information Request revealed that Mullan had made no representations to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government between his election in December 2019 and July 2020 when the decision was announced to permit phase one of Muller’s controversial ‘Nantwich South’ development. The decision by Secretary of State Robert Jenrick to allow the first phase of the 1,000 home scheme brought an end to an eight year campaign by Cheshire East, former MPs Laura Smith and Edward Timpson, and residents fighting against the development. Personal life Mullan is gay.

Early life Thelma Cecily Smith was born in Kings Cross in 1900 and she later moved with her family to Yarramalong. Clune attended school at St Mary's and studied shorthand and typing.  Career  Clune studied sculpture under Lyndon Dadswell at East Sydney Technical College. She produced sculptural works in stone and metal. Clune began painting in the 1940s, working in oils, and later produced collages on paper. She held her first solo exhibition, \\"Collages and Sculptures\\", in 1979 at the Hogarth Galleries in Paddington. Clune appeared in her husband Frank Clune's newspaper columns as the character \\"Brown Eyes\\". In the 1940s, Thelma and Frank Clune opened an art gallery in Kings Cross. It housed works by many of Australia's best known painters, including Russell Drysdale, John Passmore and John Olsen. In the 1950s and 1960s, with their younger son Terry Clune, they ran the Terry Clune Art Gallery on Macleay Street in Potts Point. This gallery supported many of Sydney's young expressionist and experimental painters, including John Olsen, Stan Rapotec, Robert Klippel, Robert Hughes, Carl Plate, Margo Lewers, Elwyn Lynn, John Rigby, Desiderius Orban and Robert Dickerson. The Clunes also provided accommodation to artists in a building adjacent to the gallery, and in their home. The Macleay Street building later became the home of artist Martin Sharp and became known as the Sydney landmark the \\"Yellow House\\". Thelma and Frank Clune were patrons and friends of many significant Australian artists, including William Dobell. Dobell's 1946 portrait of Thelma Clune is held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Susan Rothwell's bronze sculpture of Thelma Clune was a finalist in the 1984 Archibald Prize. Interviews of Clune by Hazel de Berg and Geoffrey Dutton are part of the National Library of Australia collection.

The Members of Parliament (MPs), who were elected in the 2019 general election, are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office in the House of Commons. Criteria The seniority criteria used in this article are derived from how the Father of the House is selected. They are not laid down in Standing Orders but arise from the customary practice of the House of Commons. The modern custom is that the Father of the House is the MP who has the longest continuous service. If two or more members were first elected in the same General Election (or at by-elections held on the same day), then priority is given to the one who was sworn in first. The order of swearing in is recorded in Hansard, the official record of proceedings. When a member has had broken service, that does not affect his or her seniority (for the purpose of qualifying as the Father of the House) which is based on the latest period of continuous service. The Sinn Féin members, who abstain from taking their seats at Westminster, have never been sworn in. They are ranked (in this list) after all other members who have taken their seats. Between themselves, they are ranked by the first date of the election, for the current period of continuous service. If they are equal on that criterion, then they are ranked in alphabetical order by surname. Summary of Members elected by party List This article assigns a numerical rank to each of the 650 members elected in the 2019 general election. Other members, who were not the first person declared elected to a seat but who joined the House during the Parliament, are not assigned a number.

In the past, the area used to be a forest of indigenous bushes, but deforestation during the War in Afghanistan (since 1978) led to desertification and erosion of agricultural fields. In 2000, a drought hit the region which resulted in multiplications of diseases due to malnutrition and lack of water. In 2003, the Japanese-Afghan physician Tetsu Nakamura started building irrigation canals in the region. He drew inspiration from the irrigation canals that had been built in his native Fukuoka, southwest Japan, more than 200 years ago without the aid of modern equipment. Nakamura built or restored nine canals, irrigating 16,000 hectares and supporting the livelihood of 600,000 people. It turned the area into lush forests and productive wheat farmlands.

This vaccine did not develop agglutinating antibodies. This property made it possible to distinguish infected animals (carriers of agglutinating antibodies) from vaccinated animals (not carriers of this type of antibody) and thus to facilitate disease prophylaxis. This type of vaccine also confirmed the essentially cellular nature of brucella immunity and the passive role of antibodies. * A new diagnostic methodCh.Pilet, J.M.Person, J.Frottier, R.Bastin, F.Barrat, « Test de transformation lymphoblastique et diagnostic des brucelloses chroniques », Bull.Acad.Natle.Med., 167,(8) 1983, p. 845-848J.M.

Bastin, Ch.Pilet, « Exploration of the cellular mediated immunity by the blastogenesis test during chronic brucellosis in human », Comp.Immun.Microbiol.Infect.Dis., 10, 1987, p. 1-8 The diagnosis of chronic human brucellosis is made difficult by the serological silence that is most often observed in this phase of the disease. Given the essentially cellular nature of brucella immunity, Charles Pilet and his team proposed replacing the traditional serodiagnosis with a cellular test. This new diagnostic possibility led the microbiology laboratory at the École d'Alfort to receive numerous requests for examinations from Parisian hospitals at the time. * An improved vaccine control methodCh.Pilet, Y.Legarrec, « Contrôle sur petits animaux de laboratoire du pouvoir immunogène des vaccins antibrucelliques inactivés.

Guelfi, « Non specific stimulation by inactivated or ultrasonicated Brucella abortus », Cancer Res., 47, 1974, p. 294-301 The dogma of the time that the newborn animal or human being was tolerant to a foreign substance was in fact only partially accurate. Work on immune tolerance had previously been conducted with soluble antigens. Using a particulate antigen extracted from Brucella, Charles Pilet and his team showed that in this case, the newborn mouse could respond very early to antigenic solicitation. This lack of immune tolerance is probably due to the non-specific activity of Brucella's particulate extracts on the maturation of the immune system, which becomes able to respond to specific antigenic stimulation much earlier by a classical immune response.

Sci., 317, 1994, p. 257-263  This observation relating to immune tolerance, as well as a clinical observation, led to a new direction in Charles Pilet's work. It had been noted that the injection of Mycobacterium chelonae (tubercular bacillus isolated from turtles) into animals significantly increased their resistance to infections. The isolation of the active ingredient of this bacterium, entrusted to Tsehay Neway, made it possible to isolate a polar glycopeptidolipid (GPLP). This substance has shown significant activity on immune cells. This immunostimulant acting on bone marrow stem cells was also a true hematopoietic growth factor and was able to correct immunosuppression in mice caused by cancer chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the synthesis of this product of biological origin has proved too expensive to allow human trials to be conducted.  Some works  * Ch. Pilet, J.L. Bourdon, N. Marchal.

Life Ritter was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland on 31 May 1867, the son of Guillaume (also known as Wilhelm) Ritter (1835–1912), a French architect and hydraulic engineer from Soultz responsible for enabling a supply of fresh water to La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1887, and Josephine Ducrést, a Swiss woman from Berne. Ritter went to the Jesuit school in Dole, followed by the Collège latin in Neuchâtel from 1881, then in 1885 he enrolled in the Academy of Neuchâtel. Ritter was born in Neuchâtel, shown here in 1831. As a young man Ritter was a devotee of Richard Wagner, and he made contact with French Decadent circles in Paris in his early twenties. After he graduated from the Academy he travelled extensively in Europe, first in the west – Paris, Vienna, Munich – then in the east (Czechoslovakia, Poland, Montenegro, Romania and Slovakia), gathering material for his novels. The near East provided Ritter with a taste of the exoticism, comparable to the Istanbul described by Pierre Loti, that was a particular fascination to figures within the Decadent movement in Paris, particularly the aesthete Robert de Montesquiou and Sâr Péladan. Ritter went to Prague in 1888 to learn German, then studied the history of art and music at the University of Vienna for a term, taking a course in harmony from Anton Bruckner. In 1889, his friend the French architect Léon Bachelin invited him to Bucharest, the first of a ten-year-long series of repeated trips that Ritter undertook to the east and the Balkans. The next year Ritter went to Transylvania with Nicolae Grigorescu, the painter. Tours in Albania on horseback with his friend Marcel Montandon in 1893 and a traverse of the Carpathians in 1898 by foot followed. In 1903, during a walking trip across Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, he met Janko Cádra, who became his companion and secretary until his death in 1927, and he lived with him variously in Prague (for a year between 1904 and 1905), Munich, Monruz (in Neuchâtel), Slovakia and Romania. In Munich Ritter served as tutor to Prince and Princess Rupprecht for four years, the prince becoming the last heir apparent to the Bavarian throne in 1913. After the First World War, Ritter spent much time in the newly created Czechoslovakia, but, as a homosexual aesthete and Catholic conservative he felt disillusioned with this progressive and modern democratic country that had thrown off the shackles of empire. Following Cádra's death in 1927, Ritter started a relationship with another young Slovak, Josef Červ. In 1930–1 Ritter was appointed as a lecturer in French at the University of Brno. Ritter died on 19 March 1955 in Melide. Writings Ritter has been called a \\"graphomaniac\\", and his writings are not easily categorised; many of his unpublished works are simply called \\"Notes\\". His first works were inspired and comparable to the avant-garde works of the French Symbolists, but over the course of his life his art criticism became increasingly reactionary, dismissing innovations such as Expressionism and Cubism. Music criticism Ritter was the correspondent for the Parisian literary review Mercure de France in Prague from 1904 to 1905, writing on musical matters, and 1907 he wrote the first French-language book on Bedřich Smetana. Mahler in 1907 Ritter is well known today for his writings on and support for Gustav Mahler. Ritter was initially an opponent of Mahler, like many of Mahler's critics in Vienna, on racial and antisemitic grounds. Of a performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 4 in Munich on 1901 he wrote, \\"Jewish wit has invaded the Symphony, corroding it,\\" and that the work was so \\"moist and persuasive, tantalizing and seductive\\" that it provoked \\"lewd glances in the concert halls, the salacious dribble at the corners of the mouths of some of the old men, and above all the ugly, whoring laughs of certain respectable women!\\". Ritter converted to the Mahler cause after seeing the composer conduct his own Symphony No. 3 in Prague on 2 February 1904 and in time he became one of the composer's staunchest advocates, writing glowing reviews of the premieres of Mahler's Symphony No. 7 (in Prague, 1908) and Symphony No. 8 (in Munich, 1910). Ritter viewed Mahler's music as symbolic of modern Vienna, in the same way as the architecture of Adolf Wagner and the painting of Gustav Klimt and Koloman Moser. As a keen Slavophile, Ritter also did much in the promotion of the music of Leoš Janáček. Ritter had first had dealings with Janáček in 1912, agreeing to be a judge in a Club of the Friends of Art competition, but they did not meet until 1923. They started corresponding in 1924, and in total 18 letters survive, including the last letter that Janáček wrote. Ritter attended the rehearsal and premiere of Janáček's Glagolitic Mass in Brno in November–December 1927, and told the composer that it was best thing that he had ever written. Janácek replied to a letter from Ritter about the premiere with the words: \\"The way you write about my work makes me red- faced.\\" The title of Janácek's incomplete Concerto for Solo Violin and Orchestra, Putovani dusicky (The pilgrimage of a little soul), bears a possible relation to Ritter's play L'ame et la chair (Soul and Body), the libretto of which Ritter offered to Janácek in 1924. Ritter planned to write a book on Janáček, possibly the reason for the frequent meetings that the two had in July 1928, but none was ever written. Theory of culture The debate about Swiss identity in Switzerland at the turn of the 19th–20th century concerned what constituted Swiss identity: geographical location or race – French, German or Italian. Ritter considered Swiss who spoke French had a Latin identity. Ritter's theory of culture had a profound influence on the thinking of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, who was a friend of Ritter in Munich, where they both lived, Ritter being something of a \\"mentor\\" to Le Corbusier from 1910 to 1916, assuming the fatherly role that had previously been filled by the Swiss painter Charles l'Eplattenier. Ritter's notion that identity was a product of rootedness in a particular location (provoking his ancillary dislike of rootless Americans, city-dwelling Germans and Jews), together with his lifelong affection for Slavs, made a deep impression on Le Corbusier, and was a decisive influence on his journey through the Balkans during his trip to the east in 1911, during which he studied Balkan vernacular architecture.

Jacobs (1815 or 1817Since John was two years younger than his sister Harriet, the calculation of his birthdate depends on hers. Her biographer Yellin gives 1813 as the year of Harriet's birth, without detailing day, month or season; Jean Fagan Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York, 2004, p. 3\\\\. Her tombstone, however, gives February 11, 1815 as the date of her birth (John's tombstone has no dates). Mary Maillard, who would in 2017 become the editor of the letters of Harriet's daughter, argues in favor of 1815 as the year of Harriet's birth in an article published in 2013. The dates and ages in this article are given according to Yellin. – December 19, 1873) was an African-American author and abolitionist. After escaping from slavery he published his autobiography entitled A True Tale of Slavery in the four consecutive editions of the London weekly The Leisure Hour in February 1861. He also features prominently in the classic Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, authored by his sister Harriet Jacobs.  Life   Early life in slavery  John Jacobs was born in Edenton, North Carolina, in 1815. His mother was Delilah Horniblow, a slave of the Horniblow family who owned a local tavern.John Horniblow had died in 1799. His widow, Elizabeth Horniblow, continued running the tavern and at first also kept John's grandmother, Molly Horniblow, and her children as her slaves. She gave Molly's daughter Delilah to her own invalid and unmarried daughter Margaret, who in consequence became the first owner of Delilah's children Harriet and John; Jean Fagan Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York, 2004, p. 6. The father of John and his sister Harriet (born 1813) was Elijah Knox.Jean Fagan Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York, 2004, p. 92. Elijah Knox, although enslaved, was in some ways privileged because he was an expert carpenter. He died in 1826.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), p. 18. John's mother died when he was four years old. He was allowed to continue living with his father, until at the age of nine he was hired out to Dr. James Norcom, the deceased tavern keeper's son-in-law. His sister Harriet, whom her former owner had willed to Norcom's three-year-old daughter, was also living with Norcom. Slave Auction After the death of Horniblow's widow, her slaves were sold at New Year's Day auction 1828, among them John, his grandmother Molly and Molly's son Mark. Being sold at public auction was a traumatic experience for 12-year-old John. Corresponding to page 209 in H. Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000. He was bought by Dr. Norcom and continued living in the same house as his sister.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), p. 363 (note to p. 254). While enslaved by Norcom, John Jacobs learned basic health care and succeeded in teaching himself to read (only very few slaves were literate), but even when he escaped from slavery as a young adult he was not able to write. Corresponding to pages 220 and 221 in H. Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000. Soon Norcom started to harass John's sister Harriet sexually. Hoping to escape his constant harassment, she started a relationship with Samuel Sawyer, a white lawyer, who would later be elected to the House of Representatives. In June 1835, Harriet's situation as Norcom's slave had become unbearable and she decided to escape. Furious, Norcom sold John Jacobs together with Harriet's two children to a slave trader, hoping he would transport them outside the state, thus separating them for ever from their mother and sister. But the trader had been secretly in league with Sawyer, the children's father, to whom he sold all three of them.  Escape and abolitionism  In 1838, John accompanied his new owner Sawyer as his personal servant on his honeymoon trip through the North and got his freedom by simply leaving Sawyer in New York, where slavery had been abolished. Both he himself and his sister make a point of mentioning in their respective memoirs, that John fulfilled his servant's duties to the last, leaving everything in good order and not stealing any money from his master. After unsuccessfully trying to work for his living by day and to attend school at night, in August 1839Based on the information given by Jacobs in his \\"True Tale\\", Yellin has been able to establish the exact dates of the journey: \\"The whaler Frances Henrietta weighed anchor at New Bedford on August 4, 1839, and returned on February 16, 1843\\". H.Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000, note 36 to p. 221 on p. 317, cf. p. 246. he went on a whaling voyage, taking with him all the books he wanted to study. William Lloyd Garrison 1845 daguerreotype of Walker's branded hand by photographers Southworth & Hawes. The image is reversed; it was his right hand that was branded. After returning after three and a half years, John S. Jacobs, as he called himself after his escape to freedom,Yellin interpretes the \\"S.\\" as a compliment to his last owner, Sam Sawyer; cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York, 2004, p. 75. John S. Jacobs himself writes about his relationship to Sawyer, \\"The lawyer [Sawyer] I have quite a friendly feeling for, and would be pleased to meet him as a countryman and a brother, but not as a master.\\" became more and more involved with the abolitionists led by William Lloyd Garrison. In November 1847, he went on a four-and-a-half-month lecturing tour together with captain Jonathan Walker. Walker, a white man, showed his hand as proof of the slaveholders' barbaric brutality. The hand had been branded with the letters SS (meaning \\"slave stealer\\") after he had tried to assist a group of fugitives.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 93–94. After that, Jacobs undertook other lecture tours for the abolitionist cause on his own. Early in 1849, he went on a 16-day tour together with Frederick Douglass,Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), p. 98. H. Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000, pp. xviii, xix. who had made his escape from slavery in 1838 only weeks before Jacobs had made his.Yellin gives the date of Jacobs's escape as \\"Late autumn\\". H. Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000, p. 246. For a short period in 1849, Jacobs, with the help of his sister Harriet, took over the management of the \\"Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room\\" in Rochester, New York, which was situated in the same building as Douglass's newspaper The North Star.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 102, 103. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law which made it easier for slaveholders to force fugitives back into slavery. John S. Jacobs was one of the speakers on rallies protesting against that law.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 107, 108. At the end of that year, he went to California to try his luck as a gold miner. Later he went on to Australia together with Harriet's son Joseph, again searching for gold. It is not clear, whether his decision to go to California and on to Australia was caused by the Fugitive Slave Law. His sister explicitly states that the law did not apply to John S., because he didn't come to the free states as fugitive, but was brought there by his master. On the other hand, Garrison wrote many years later on occasion of John Jacobs's funeral, that he stayed on in the North until the Fugitive Slave Law was passed and then left the county \\"knowing that there was no longer any safety for him on our soil.\\"Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), p. 226. He did not have much success either in California or in Australia, and so went on to England, going to sea from there. When his sister went to Great Britain in 1858 and again in 1867/68, the siblings failed to meet, because on both occasions John was at sea – in 1858, he was in the Middle East, ten years later in India. Still, John S. and Harriet Jacobs always kept in touch by mail.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 137, 138, 212.  Autobiography  Frederick Douglass (Picture taken between 1847 and 52) The idea to write down their experiences as slaves cannot have been new to the Jacobs siblings. As early as 1845 Frederick Douglass had written A Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. John S. himself was the one to urge his sister to write down her story. Abolitionist and feminist Amy Post whom Harriet Jacobs had come to know through John, finally was the person to convince Harriet, who in 1853 started working on her Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 118, 119. published in January 1861. John Jacobs' own narrative is much shorter. It was published in the four February editions of the London weekly The Leisure Hour in 1861, entitled A True Tale of Slavery.Reprinted in: Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Boston: For the Author, 1861. Enlarged Edition. Edited and with an Introduction by Jean Fagan Yellin. Now with \\"A True Tale of Slavery\\" by John S. Jacobs. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987–2000, pp. 207–228. The first three parts narrate his life up to his escaping and going on the whaling voyage, the fourth part relates cruelties against other slaves he had witnessed. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling. Still, John mentions neither Norcom's sexual harassment nor Sawyer's relationship with his sister. Harriet's children first appear in the moment they are put into jail together with their uncle in preparation for their sale to the trader. Since he doesn't mention the parental relationship between his last owner and his sister's children, the reasons for Sawyer's interest in buying children and uncle remain unclear in John Jacobs' tale. This is also true for the reasons of the good treatment John Jacobs received while being Sawyer's slave, who didn't treat his numerous other slaves well. Corresponding to pages 215 and 216 in H. Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Ed. J. F. Yellin, Cambridge, 2000. These things only become clear to the readers of Harriet's book.Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 148, 149. Harriet Jacobs changes all the names in her book, given names as well as family names. However, John Jacobs (called \\"William\\" in his sister's book) uses the correct given names, but only uses the (correct) first letter of the family names. So Dr. Norcom is \\"Dr. Flint\\" in Harriet's book, but \\"Dr. N-\\" in John's. The only exceptions in John's tale are Sawyer, whose name he abbreviates at first, but later gives in full, and his own name, which he gives as the signature under the letter written by a friend, in which he tells Sawyer that he has left: \\"No longer yours, John S. Jacobs\\".  Family and death  Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1875 In the mid-1860s, aged about 50, John S. Jacobs married Englishwoman Elleanor Ashland, who had two children from a previous relationship. The only child they had together, Joseph Ramsey Jacobs, was born about 1866.When Harriet Jacobs visited her brother's family in 1867/68, Joseph was described as a \\"toddler\\", Jean Fagan Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York, 2004, p. 212. In 1873, he returned to the U.S. together with his wife and the three children to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, close to his sister and her daughter Louisa Matilda. He died the same year, on December 19, 1873. Having been invited by Louisa Matilda, William Lloyd Garrison participated in the funeral. Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs later were interred at his side on Mount Auburn Cemetery. His widow stayed in the United States until her death in 1903, but it seems that there was no further contact between Harriet Jacobs' family and hers. Harriet's biographer Jean Fagan Yellin supposes that Elleanor Jacobs severed the ties so that her children would not fall victims to American racism. Seemingly Joseph Ramsey Jacobs was able to \\"pass for white\\".Yellin: Harriet Jacobs: A Life (2004), pp. 226f.  References   Further reading  * Harriet A.

Having been elected prime minister on 28 August 2014 with the support of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Davutoğlu later opposed the latter's moves to transform Turkey's form of government from a parliamentary to a presidential system. His conflict with Erdoğan culminated in Davutoğlu's resignation from the premiership, effective from 22 May 2016. Following his resignation, Davutoğlu frequently criticized the AKP government, which led the party to launch disciplinary actions against him. In response, he resigned from the AKP on 13 September 2019. He later expressed interest in forming a new party in opposition to President Erdoğan's administration, and ultimately launched the Future Party on 12 December 2019. The new party immediately published a list of 154 founding members which included numerous former AKP officials and affiliates. Policies Davutoğlu has stated that the new party would push for a new constitution, a return to a parliamentary system, and education in minority languages.

At the time of his death, Wiersum was the lawyer of state witness Nabil Bakkali in the Marengo case against the Mocro Maffia led by Ridouan Taghi. The murder caused a great shock in the world of lawyers; it was called \\"an attack on the rule of law\\". Background Derk Wiersum started as lawyer of Nabil Bakkali in the Marengo process against the Mocro Maffia led by Ridouan Taghi in 2017. In the Margengo process, 16 suspects are standing trial for multiple murders and attempted murders between 2015 and 2017. Ridouan Taghi and his henchman Saïd Razzouki are being prosecuted for giving the orders for these murders and for leading a criminal organization. Nabil Bakkali was arrested on 14 January 2017 for prohibited possession of weapons and on 5 September 2017 for his involvement in the murder of Hakim Changachi, who was killed on 12 January 2017. Bakkali is also suspected of involvement in other murders. Changachi was a good friend of Bakkali and not the target of the murder. Because of this, Bakkali felt guilty and told the family of Changachi about his involvement. Taghi found out about this and put Bakkali on a death list. Bakkali felt unsafe and decided to become a state witness in exchange for halving his prison sentence. A week after the announcement of Bakkali being state witness, on 29 March 2018, Reduan Bakkali was killed by Shurandy S.. Reduan Bakkali was the brother of Nabil Bakkali.

The shooter, a hoodie-wearing man dressed in black, fled the scene and escaped in a white Opel Combo. A second person was waiting in the getaway car. According to a witness, who was 15 meters from the murder, Wiersum and the shooter had an argument near Wiersum's car. The witness heard Wiersum say words like \\"piss off\\" and \\"goddamnit.\\" The shooter walked away from the car with Wiersum behind him. Then Wiersum was shot to death.

After ten years he started a law firm together with Bart Stapert. In 2017 he started working at Blaauw Advocaten. Wiersum started his own law firm in March 2019. He also worked as a deputy judge at the Breda court. In recent years before his death, Wiersum has focused primarily on serious and organized crime. Besides his work as lawyer and judge, he was treasurer for Stichting Rechtshulp Terdoodveroordeelden and he worked as a lawyer for the Dutch & Detained foundation, which provides independent legal advice to Dutch nationals who are detained abroad. Derk Wiersum was married with Arjette Wiersum, they had two children together. Suspects The police arrested a first male suspect on 1 October 2019 in line for checking in at Schiphol. No details were given about the suspect. It's believed that this man was the driver of the getaway car, which was found in Almere. In the night of 20 November 2019, the 26-year-old Anouar Taghi from Maarssen was arrested on a highway. He is a cousin of Ridouan Taghi, the police suspect him to be the organizer of the murder. Anouar Taghi was a member of the Utrecht 'Audi- bende'. In 2016 he was sentenced to four years in prison for a plofkraak in Meppen. Anouar Taghi was already under investigation by the police. The criminal investigation department assumes that he led a group of co-suspects who were dealing with stolen cars, used for ram-raiding and plofkraken. Those cars were parked in a warehouse in Utrecht, cleaned and \\"whipped\\" (checked for eavesdropping equipment or monitoring beacons). At the end op April 2020, Anouar Taghi was arrested for his involvement in an attempted murder and for participation in a criminal organization. On 30 October 2019, a 28-year-old man was attacked by three men wearing balaclavas with a sledgehammer in Utrecht. The victim was badly injured, but survived the attack. Taghi was arrested for this attempted murder together with two other men from Utrecht. In addition, the police suspect Taghi of leading a criminal organization of which the two other men arrested are also members. This gang is suspected of facilitating liquidations by stealing cars and reselling them. Sources within the criminal circuit state that the victim of the sledgehammer attack also belonged to the organization, but no longer wanted to cooperate. According to these sources, the suspects wanted to send a signal with the attack. The Volkswagen Transporter, used in the scouting before the murder of Derk Wiersum, was also stolen by someone from this criminal organization. On 6 January 2020, the OM announced that the man arrested in October is the 36-year-old Giërmo Brown from Almere, he is of Surinamese descent. The OM says he is co-perpetrator of the murder. It's unknown if this means that he is the shooter. Brown is also suspected of observing the victim in the stolen vehicles from 30 August 2019, alone or with others, and the handling of these vehicles from 11 June 2019. When the getaway car, white Opel Combo, was shown on television by the police, Brown bought a plane ticket to Suriname. He never got on the plane as he was arrested on the airport. In 2012, Brown committed two violent robberies together with someone else. He was sentenced to 7 years in prison for these robberies. Brown was also convicted of owning 50 grams of hashish in the prison in Vught in 2015. In 2016, Brown abused an employee of the same prison. Brown has a girlfriend and is a father. A 31-year-old man from Rotterdam was arrested on 27 January 2020. The suspect was later named as Moreno B.. He is suspected of co-perpetrating the murder. More information about this suspect is unknown yet. Investigation After the murder, the police issued a description of the suspect. They were looking for a man between 20 and 25 years old, with a slender stature, about 1.75 metres tall, and he was dressed in dark clothes. Because the man wore a hoodie, no skin color is known about him. The shooter escaped in a white Opel Combo with false licence plate. A second person was waiting in the getaway car. It's believed that this person was the man arrested on 1 October 2019. The getaway car was stolen in June 2019 in Rotterdam. The police found out that this car was near the house of the victim a day before the murder. The Opel Combo was found in Almere at the house of Brown, it's unknown when the car was found. The investigation made clear that more vehicles were probably involved in the case. Two days before the murder a grey Volkswagen Transporter, used for disabled transportation, was driving in the neighborhood were the victim lived for about two hours. This van was stolen on 5 September 2019 in Brunssum, and was found on 23 September 2019 in a parking garage in Amsterdam-Zuidoost with a flat tire. On 24 September 2019, a burt out Renault Mégane was found in Voorburg. Investigation made clear that this car was stolen in June 2019 in Nieuwegein. The car was spotted multiple times near the house of Wiersum in the end of August 2019. On 19 November 2019, the police detained two persons for fencing a stolen vehicle used to monitor the victim before the murder. They were released after questioning. The next day, the police arrested Anouar Taghi, a cousin of Ridouan Taghi. In one of the vehicles used in the murder, the police found information that could be linked to Anouar Taghi. He is suspected to be the organizer of the murder. Ridouan Taghi was arrest by the Dubai Police Force on 16 December 2019 in an apartment in Dubai. He was deported to the Netherlands on 18 December 2019. There is no evidence yet that Taghi ordered the murder. He is currently detained in Nieuw Vosseveld. 23-year-old Jerlonny P., also known as rapper Kerron, from Brunssum was arrested for stealing the Volkswagen Transporter and deliver to Anouar Taghi. As a specialist in car theft, he came into contact with the Mocro Maffia. He incorporates his criminal activities into his rap lyrics. Trial The first session on 15 January 2020 is in the extra secure Bunker location in Amsterdam. This is a preparatory session, which, among other things, looks at the provisional detention of Giërmo Brown. During this session, the prosecutor said they have the following evidence against Brown for his involvement in the murder. There is evidence that he has driven around more often before the murder in the getaway car. There are camera images, there is paid with Brown's debit card when refueling and the data from his phone matches the movements of the car on twelve dates. Blood from Wiersum was also found in the getaway car. They were probably transferred to the car by the shooter. Brown's DNA was found on the gear lever of another car that was used for observations. The police have also intercepted messages and tapped telephone conversations. This included cleaning (of possibly the getaway car), a \\"cleaning ritual\\" that can be performed to \\"ward off\\" the minds of deceased people. Messages have also been found that point to the acquisition of weapons and a car. Brown also wanted to know, according to reports, the license plate of the car of Wiersum, because he does not just want to drive laps. Some of these messages were deleted. There is a large amount of phone conversations and messages in the hands of the OM. It also appears that Brown is making telephone contact with a phone number that has again contacted Wiersum by telephone. At the time of the murder, this telephone was close to the crime scene and disappeared completely after the murder. After the murder, Brown suddenly had a lot of money to spend. He paid off debts, gave money to his children and paid an amount of more than €15,000 in cash for a car. According to the OM, all this facts, and the fact that he was trying to flee to Suriname, is enough evidence to hold Brown in prison for three more months. According to the OM, investigations are currently ongoing into more suspects in the murder case. \\"They are expected to be arrested,\\" it sounded today. They also take into account that the murder of lawyer Derk Wiersum should have taken place the day before the actual murder, but that the perpetrators were surprised by the fact that Wiersum took the bike that day instead of taking the car to work. On 27 January 2020, the police arrested a 31-year-old man, later named as Moreno B., from Rotterdam. He is suspected of co-perpetrating the murder and was arrested in Amsterdam. The first session against Anouar Taghi is on 4 March 2020. The judiciary is convinced that the group around Anouar Taghi delivered cars to the perpetrators of the murder, such as the Renault Mégane and the Volkswagen Transporter that appear to have been used for pre-observations. In Taghi's home the police found equipment for tracking cars and jammers, for disrupting means of communication: things that are frequently used in the harsh criminal environment, including during liquidations. The Renault Mégane, who drove at least 26 times through the street where Wiersum lived in August, was signaled during a police operation in Taghi's warehouse in Utrecht in the same month. The judiciary says Anouar Taghi ordered a few days after the murder to set the Renault Mégane on fire, the car was found burned out in Voorburg. His phone was also seen at the same location as the Renault Mégane in the weeks prior to the murder. He also had pictures on his phone of the cars used in the murder. Because of the other investigation against Taghi, the police had placed eavesdropping equipment in his house. A few days after a broadcast of Opsporing Verzocht about the murder he had a telephone conversation with an unknown Surinamese man. In this conversation he said: 'I am wanted for the murder of Wiersum and therefore I get out of the air for a while. My DNA is found'. The Surinamese man asked him for money, but Taghi did not want to give it and became angry. The court decided to detain Anouar Taghi for at least another three months. The first session against Moreno B. was on 1 April 2020. B. himself was not physically present because of the coronavirus. He is suspected of co-perpetrating the murder and the handling of two stolen cars. According to the OM, B. had been involved in observations and preliminary investigations around the home of Wiersum in the weeks before the murder. His DNA has been found on the passenger seat of the Opel Combo and the Volkswagen Transporter. B.'s telecom data can also be linked to the travel movements of the cars. On 11 and 16 September 2019, B.'s phone tried to contact Wiersum. He may have wanted to find out if the lawyer was at home. On September 18, just before the murder, B.'s phone made contact with a cell tower near the crime scene. B. says he was with his mother and youngest brother on the day of the murder, his mother confirms this, but the OM doesn't believe this alibi. On 16 and 17 September, Wiersum left by bicycle instead of by car, after which the Volkswagen Transporter and the Opel Combo drove out of the street. The criminal investigation department assumes that the perpetrators were surprised by Wiersum leaving home by bicycle, and therefore postponed the murder. The court thinks that there is enough evidence extend Moreno B.'s temporary custody with 90 days. Giermo Brown's detention was also extended. On 29 July 2020, Anouar Taghi confessed that he hired warehouses under a false name to park stolen cars together with Oussama B. and Jesse S. from Utrecht. But Taghi denies that he deliberately supplied the Renault Mégane and Volkswagen Transporter for the murder. On 21 September 2020, all three suspects were present at the session for the first time. The OM still thinks that Moreno B. is the shooter, but B.'s lawyer says that his client does not resemble the descriptions of witnesses. The witnesses said the shooter was a young, slightly tinted slim man. But Moreno B. is not a teenager, black and muscular. CCTV footage of the murder showed that the shooter has a strange walk. This can be explained by the medical abnormality at the feet of B. All the suspects stay in prison until the next session on 8 December 2020. Aftermath The prosecutor said they will keep using state witnesses, even after the murder. They have to continue using state witnesses otherwise they will get no further in criminal cases. But the prosecutor wants more options in the use of such suspects-turned-informants. Since Wiersum's murder, a total of 20 to 30 people closely related to the Taghi case have received extra security. This includes judges and prosecutors. The level of protection varies depending on the person and the significance of their role in the case. The extra security is the installing of security cameras and the increased police presence in the neighbourhood. The people who are the closed linked to the case receive personal security provided by the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Service (DKDB). This service also offers protection for members of the Dutch Royal Family. The lawyer who succeeded Derk Wiersum as a lawyer for Nabil Bakkali, who wants to stay anonymous for his own safety, already withdraws in early December 2019. He was not satisfied with the state of affairs regarding safety measures. On 3 January 2020, it was announced that Nabil Bakkali has two new lawyers. Both lawyers stay anonymous. Ridouan Taghi's lawyer, Inez Weski, objects to keeping the new lawyers anonymous. She wants to be able to check whether Bakkali explains from his own knowledge, or has possibly consulted with his lawyers or others. On 12 March 2020 it was announced that the two new lawyers have withdrawn. Why they quit is not clear. On 29 June 2020 Peter Schouten became the new lawyer of the state witness. On short term Bakkali will get a second lawyer. Peter R. de Vries becomes the confidential counselor and the spokesman of Bakkali and his family. On 10 July 2020, Onno de Jong was announced as the second lawyer of Bakkali. De Jong specializes in assisting state witnesses. One year after the murder, Minister of Justice and Security Ferdinand Grapperhaus came with the proposal to punish threats against lawyers, public prosecutors and judges with a maximum of four years in prison. Grapperhaus said about the lawyers, public prosecutors and judges: 'They play an indispensable role in our rule of law. These functions are crucial to independent justice.

A follower of the Oxford Movement, she eventually converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism after she was widowed. Life Kerr was born in the family seat of Ingestre Hall in Staffordshire. She was one of twelve children. Her parents were Frances Thomasine and Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot. She was the sixth child and her mother died shortly after the birth of the twelfth child. Her father took an interest in her education and ensured she was well read and that she had an understanding of their religion. Kerr married on 12 July 1831 and went to live in Scotland with her husband John Kerr, 7th Marquess of Lothian. Her favourite home was near Jedburgh at Monteviot House, but the family seat was Newbattle Abbey. She moved to Monteviot in 1840 in order to attend her nearest Scottish Episcopal church which was in Kelso. Her husband died at another estate in Norfolk in 1841 after they had seven children. She took an increasing interest in the religious Oxford Movement who argued that Anglicanism needed to reintroduce aspects of Roman Catholicism into their high church practices. The followers were known as Tractarianists and her spiritual advisor John Henry Newman was a leading thinker in the group. She founded St John's church in Jedburgh Kerr funded the creation of an Anglican church St John's in Jedburgh near to Monteviot. The church was consecrated on 15 August 1843. The church was opened with invited speakers, a full choir and services that took several days. Two years later Newman became a Roman Catholic and in 1851 Kerr under Henry Edward Manning's instruction also converted to Catholicism. Her children were now in jeopardy as discrimination under British law against Catholics was legally required. She was only one of the guardians of her children and the others were going to interfere as they were concerned that she may convert them. Kerr did in fact smuggle her children to Edinburgh where they were received in to the Roman Catholic faith. Her eldest son was away at Oxford University and he remained an Anglican. St. David's Roman Catholic Church in Dalkeith Kerr built a new, and now listed, St. David's Roman Catholic church in Dalkeith. She befriended Charlotte Montagu Douglas Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch who would in time also convert, in 1860. She and Charlotte paid for charitable work in Edinburgh, and Kerr's daughter, (also) Cecil, became a nun. Kerr died on one of her frequent trips to Rome in 1877, but she was buried within her church in Dalkeith at the foot of the altar. The altar was commissioned that year by her son Walter.

Background The group is led by Aslbek Musin, the son of the former Speaker of the Majlis, Aslan Musin, both of whom are Quranists. In 2009, there was a public debate on the religious status of Quranists in Kazakhstan, who are represented by the representatives of Izgi Amal within the country. During the public debate chaired by the Tolerance Society and the National Security Committee, other religious minorities were also scrutinized with probes into their religious status, such as the Krishna Consciousness Society and Salafism. With regard to the Quranists, concern was particularly raised as the leading base for Islamic scholarship based at Azhar University had recently issued a fatwa declaring the Quranist denomination as being illegal within the country, and furthermore imprisoned the leading Quranist personality within the country called Ahmed Mansour. Nonetheless, spokesmen of Izgi Amal have argued that it isn't a strictly religious organization and rather engages in activities associated with societal and economic upliftment within Kazakhstan.https://zonakz.net/2009/05/12/%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%BE-%D1%96%D0%B7%D0%B3%D1%96-%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB/ The main concentration of Quranists in Kazakhstan is in the western parts of the Mangystau Region.Бейсенов, Б.

Izgi Amal strands There are two main strands in the Izgi Amal movement, the Quran aloners and the Quran-centric Izgi Amalists. Quran-aloners There are two main strands among the Izgi Amalist Quranists. One strand is the one that uses terms such as \\"Quran alone\\"; this subset of Quranists exclude all religious texts which are not the Quran and uses it as the sole source of religiosity. Some Izgi Amalists use the self-identifiers of Quranites, Quran aloners or Quraniyoon to describe themselves, while retorts such as munkirū al-ḥadīṯ (منكروا الحديث) (i.e. \\"negators of Hadith\\" / \\"hadith rejectors\\"), have in turn been levelled at them. Quran-centric The other set of Quranists in Izgi Amal take a less sweeping stance and avoids usage of the term \\"Quran alone\\", instead using terms such as Quranist or may even avoid using self-identifiers altogether. The set of IZgi Amal Quranists who avoid usage of the word \\"Quran alone\\", specify their doctrine as one which is Quran focused rather than exterior texts. For Izgi Amalists who utilize the application of additional sources besides the Quran, their standpoint is that unlike hadithists, they do not consider such texts as canonical to the faith. From the perspective of some Quran centric Izgi Amalists, the usage of tafsir is permitted, however, reliance on hadith texts as a primary source runs the risk of insinuating that the Quran needs supplemental text, or even suggestive of additional religious texts or the peril of abrogating the Quran. As such, Izgi Amal Quranists view the term hadith in its modern usage as a canonical collection as a misnomer, as from their perspective, the original archaic sense referred to the Quran itself. As such, Izgi Amal Quranists use the classical, obsolete or archaic sense of the word hadith.Daribaiuly, S. \\"Ақын-жыраулар поэзиясындағы шариғат негіздері.\\" Евразийский журнал филологии: Наука и Образование 166.2 (2018): 42-47.

History Gall was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk, where he served his apprenticeship as a printer, worked for a time in London, then with his young wife emigrated to South Australia aboard William Stevenson, arriving in Adelaide in May 1850. He found employment in the printing business, and in July 1855 was admitted to the partnership of Hussey & Shawyer, trading as Hussey, Shawyer and Gall on King William Street, \\"near Green's Exchange\\". Shawyer left in 1856 to open his own printery on Gawler Place, and Hussey and Gall continued to March 1857, when Gall took over the running of the business, at that time located at 47 King William Street, adjacent Green's Auction Mart, \\"at the end of a long passage\\". In August 1859 they moved to larger premises at 89 King William Street, opposite White's Rooms. They were still at the same address when Gall founded The Comet (February 1867 – December 1881), a monthly magazine which he used, inter alia to promote his arguments for protection of native industries. In 1871 the business was saved from destruction when the \\"Nimble Ninepence\\" store next door was destroyed by fire. Reginald Sheridan (died 8 November 1882), the manager, commenced removal of records and valuable paper after the first explosion, but in the event action by the fire brigade prevented the fire from spreading. In January 1873 Gall sold the business to Sheridan, who continued to run it as \\"Gall & Sheridan\\", until July 1875, when he sold it to George, Edmund and George Scrymgour, jun., the first two having been members of Gall's staff. They continued trading as Gall & Sheridan until November, when it became Scrymgour & Sons, and was still operating under that name at 115 King William Street in 1962. Other interests *Gall was a prolific letter-writer to the Adelaide press, ever ready to push his views on a variety of subjects. He believed without protection, Australian industry and enterprise would never develop, and under the slogan \\"What shall we do with our boys?\\", and its reply \\"Encourage local industries, so as to give them profitable employment\\" strongly argued his case. *He was a supporter of the Botanic Garden, and strenuously fought attempts by Sir Edwin Smith to annex six or eight of its acres for the Zoological Gardens. *He protested against excision of further Park Land for the benefit of the \\"Old Race Course\\" (Victoria Park). *He was vocal in his condemnation of mistreatment of racehorses and an active supporter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . *He was regular church-goer, an adherent of The Christian Church, in Grote Street, with which his erstwhile partner Herbert Hussey was closely associated. *He was a founding member of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and a member of its committee. *While on holidays in Europe, following his relinquishing of the business to Sheridan, he wrote regular reports for the South Australian press, and later, as \\"Delta\\", was a regular contributor to the South-Eastern Star, a Mount Gambier weekly published by James Fletcher Jones & Co. from 2 October 1877 to 13 October 1930, when it was taken over by its competitor The Border Watch. *One of his particular interests was the North Adelaide School for the Blind. *He edited a Guide to Adelaide, published by Scrymgour & Sons, for the use of visitors to the Jubilee Exhibition. *Though never a political candidate he was, as a frequent auditor in the Strangers' Gallery, well informed on political debate in both houses of parliament. *He was an active member of the Field Naturalists Society, and a frequent participant in their rambles. *He was recognised as an amateur artist.

His research focuses on discourse analysis. It associates a pragmatic outlook on discourse with linguistic «enunciation» theories and some aspects of Michel Foucault's line of thought.  Biography  Maingueneau studied linguistics and philosophy at the \\"École Normale Supérieure de Saint-Cloud\\" (1970-1974) and at the University of Paris 10 (now Paris Nanterre University). He obtained in 1974 a first PhD (\\"doctorat de 3° cycle\\") in linguistics: Building a discursive semantics; he was awarded a second one (\\"doctorat d’État\\") in 1979: Semantics of controversy. From discourse to interdiscourse. He became lecturer at the University of Amiens (1974), then professor (1988). In 2000 he moved to the University of Paris XII; from 2012 to 2019 he was professor of French linguistics and discourse analysis at the Sorbonne. He was a member of the Institut Universitaire de France (2006-2011)....http://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/Dominique- Maingueneau . His books have been translated into thirteen languages.  Research  He has published on French linguistics, and above all on discourse analysis. In the latter area he has written a wide range of handbooks: Initiation aux méthodes de l’analyse du discours (1976), Nouvelles tendances en analyse du discours (1987), l’Analyse du discours (1991), Les termes clés de l’analyse du discours (1996), Analyser les textes de communication (1998), Discours et analyse du discours (2014). He was also the co-editor, with P. Charaudeau, of the Dictionnaire d’analyse du discours (2002). With J. Angermuller and R. Wodak he edited The Reader in Discourse Studies: Main currents in Theory and Analysis (2014). In his view, discourse analysis is only one of the disciplines belonging to discourse studies. Each of these disciplines (rhetoric, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis, etc.) is based on a specific interest. The interest of discourse analysis is to consider that discourse articulates text and social places. This means that its object is not textual organisation nor communicative situation, but what binds them through a certain genre. Like most French speaking discourse analysts, he draws on enunciative pragmatics. His research has tackled a great diversity of corpora, apart from ordinary conversation: advertising, handbooks, literature, newspapers, politics, philosophy, religion, the Internet… He justifies the diversity of his corpora by claiming that discourse analysts must study any manifestation of discourse, instead of focusing only on conversation, media and other social areas such as politics, education, business, justice, the health system\\"The heterogeneity of discourse: expanding the field of discourse analysis\\", Palgrave Communications, 3, 2017: http://www.palgrave- journals.com/articles/palcomms201758.  Main topics  • Interdiscourse: building on his research on religious controversiesSémantique de la polémique (1983) and Genèses du discours (1984)., he has developed a theory of \\"intermisunderstanding\\". He assumes that in a given field the relevant unit of analysis is not each discourse in isolation but the ruled interaction between discourses through which the enunciative identities are defined and preserved. According to M.-A Paveau and G.-E. Sarfati, \\"Maingueneau shows how a discourse is born, how it develops into a consistent whole and a homogeneous space that lasts beyond the individual and temporal variations\\" M.-A. Paveau & G.-E. Sarfati (2003), Les grandes théories de la linguistique, Paris, A. Colin, p.199. • Genres: like many other discourse analysts, he gives a central role to genres of discourseJ. Cavalcanti, \\"A presença do conceito Gêneros de Discurso nas reflexões de D. Maingueneau\\", Lingugem em (Dis)curso, vol. 1, 2, 429-448: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260770059_The_incidence_of_discourse_genre_concept_in_D_Maingueneau's_work, which are analysed into various components: partners, place, time, etc. A genre is considered as a \\"scene of enunciation\\", which is broken down into a) an \\"enclosing scene\\" (religious, political, administrative, medical, etc.), b) a \\"generic scene\\" which assigns roles to actors, prescribes the right place and the right moment, the medium, the text superstructure, etc. ; c) a “scenography”: the same generic scene, for instance preaching in a church, may stage different scenographies: prophetic, friendly, meditative…\\"An academic genre\\" (2002), Discourse studies, 4, 3, 319-342. The word scène 'is chosen in order to stress the idea that the act of enunciation, parole, is a mise en scène, a sort of theatrical production that takes place in the form of a self- constituting process occurring within a defined discursive space. By adopting the theatrical metaphor of scène d’énonciation, Maingueneau endeavors to enter discourse “from the inside.” J. Pier (2019), 'Narrative theory and Discourse Analysis\\", http://narratologie.ehess.fr/narrative-theory-and-discourse- analysis/. • Ethos: he contributed to introducing the question of ethos into the field of discourse analysis. He has developed the concept of “embodiment” (in French « incorporation »): the addressee constructs a certain image of the speaker, by giving him/her psychological (“character”) and somatic (“corporality”) properties, based on shared stereotypes\\"Ethos, scénographie, incorporation\\", in Images de soi dans le discours, La construction de l’ethos (1999), R. Amossy (ed.), Lausanne, Delachaux et Niestlé, 75-101; \\"Retour critique sur l’ethos\\", Langage et Société (2014), 149, 31-48. About Maingueneau'sconcept of ethos: I. G. Ribeiro Gonçalves, \\"A maçã, o corpo, a tentação: encontros de Bakhtin e Maingueneau no interdiscurso\\" (2016), Revista ALED, v.2, n.2: http://www.revistaaledbr.ufscar.br/index.php/revistaaledbr/article/view/150; A. Chauvin-Vileno, \\"Ethos et texte littéraire. Vers une problématique de la voix\\", Semen, 14, 2002, (http://journals.openedition.org/semen/2509. • Self- constituting discourses: in the universe of discourse a specific area can be delimited: that of “self-constituting discourses” (science, philosophy, Art, law, philosophy religion). They have a particular relationship with the foundations of society. To found other discourses without being founded by them, they must set themselves up as intimately bound with a legitimising Source and show that they are in accordance with it, owing to the operations by which they structure their texts\\"Analysing self-constituting discourses\\", Discourse studies (1999), vol.1, 2, 175-200.. Maingueneau has mainly studied literatureLe discours littéraire. Paratopie et scène d'énonciation (2004); \\"Literature and discourse analysis\\", Acta Linguistica Hafniensia (2010), Vol. 42, 1, 147-158. and philosophyLa philosophie comme institution discursive (2015), in this perspective. Tightly connected with self-constituting discourses, the concept of paratopy has been widely used in literary theoryC. Edwards, \\"The paratopic imagination.

Maingueneau assumes that these sentences do not imply the same kind of enunciation as usual utterances: while in “texualizing enunciation” speakers produce texts belonging to genres, for aphorising enunciations the very notions of text and speaker are irrelevantLes phrases sans texte (2012). • Gender: he published two books about the figure of the fatal womanCarmen (1984), Féminin fatal (1999)., and various articles about the relationship between woman and sayings and about the \\"Précieuses\\" of the French 17th century \\"Stéréotyper le féminin : entre le doxique et l’esthétique\\" (2004), Degrés, n° 117, b 1-25 ; \\"Faire parler des femmes ridicules.

Her creative work included performing, directing and writing; making masks, puppets and costumes; film-making, illustration and publishing. She was a co-founder with Alan Brunton of the iconic Red Mole Theatre Company in 1974 and with Madeline McNamara of Magdalena Aotearoa in 1997.  Biography  Rodwell was born in Dunedin in 1950 and spent her later childhood in Rotorua, attending Rotorua Intermediate School and Rotorua Girls’ High School. She graduated with an MA in English from the University of Auckland in 1970. Other education included a diploma in Russian language, and teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). While at university in Auckland Rodwell was Director of the University Arts Centre and Cultural Affairs Officer for the Students’ Association, she chaired the University Theatre Company, and she was also part of the Student Capping Week Revue in 1970 called Was 1969 Really Necessary? From 1988, she lived in Island Bay, Wellington, with Alan Brunton and their daughter Ruby. She was actively involved with community organisations and projects including Peace Movement Aotearoa, the Southern Environmental Association and the Island Bay Residents Association. Rodwell and Brunton rehearsed in Island Bay at the Island Bay Surf Club and also the historic building of Erskine College. In 1992 the Save Erskine College Trust (SECT) was established to save the building from demolition, with Brunton an original trustee. Following the sudden death of her husband and artistic partner Alan Brunton in 2002, Rodwell struggled with depression and ultimately chose to take her own life on 15 October 2006. A few months earlier she had collaborated on a radio documentary to help raise awareness about depression.  Career  Rodwell and Brunton founded Red Mole Theatre Company in 1974, which quickly established itself at the forefront of New Zealand's avant- garde. Rodwell was a key member of the troupe, participating as a performer, co-author, maker of masks and costumes, and film-maker. From 1978 to 1988 the company traveled extensively in Mexico, the USA, and Europe, for much of that time based in New York. After returning to Wellington, Rodwell continued to collaborate with Brunton and Red Mole, as well as leading workshops for and performing with the women's comedy company Hen's Teeth. It was here that she met and began to collaborate with Madeline McNamara. They created the show Crow Station which they toured to the Magdalena Project Festival in Cardiff, Wales, in 1994. This experience inspired Rodwell and McNamara to mount a similar festival in New Zealand. They founded the Magdalena Aotearoa Trust in 1997 and gathered a team of local women to organise the 1999 Magdalena Aotearoa International Festival of Women's Performance in Wellington and Paekakariki, March-April 1999. The Trust continues to organise events and host international artists. Rodwell worked in a theatre company called Roadworks. In 2000 she directed and adapted O Fortuna by G. G. Marquez, starring Angeline Conaghan, Bridget Kelly and Tahi Mapp-Boren.  Selected Works  * Crow Station (performance), 1993. Sally Rodwell, Madeline McNamara. * Shoes (short film), 1997.

It started in 1853 with the discovery of unusually high-quality iron ore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. A group of businessmen in the Detroit area figured this could be a profitable enterprise to manufacture iron and steel so pooled together funds to form a new company. It made the first commercially available steel in America. One of the first uses for this steel was tracks for railroads. It was in business until 1892.  Founding  Eureka Iron & Steel Works historical marker Philip Thurber, a businessman from the Detroit area, took a summer vacation in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 1853. The discovery of iron ore in the Marquette area where he was vacationing piqued his interest. He tested samples and found them to be of unusually high quality, so he decided to develop a new enterprise using this iron ore. With a group of investors, the Eureka Iron Works company was then organized on October 15, 1853. The new company consisted of ten stockholders. Eber Brock Ward, a ship captain, became the president. Thomas W. Lockwood was its treasurer and George S. Thurber was its secretary. The new company had 20,000 shares valued at twenty-five dollars each. The Eureka Iron Works company looked around the Detroit area for a suitable piece of land for a foundry. The company decided on a plot owned by Major John Biddle as a summer estate called \\"Wyandotte.\\" The land was purchased at $20 per acre and became the village of Wyandotte on December 12, 1854. It is today the city of Wyandotte, Michigan. The plot was chosen because its of river frontage could be used to receive iron ore by ship from the Lake Superior region of the Upper Peninsula. The land also had timber that was used in making charcoal and was close to quarries supplying limestone, a product needed to make iron and steel. In 1855, the company built a complex of buildings for the company and workmen. A blast furnace and a bar mill known as the Wyandotte Rolling Mill were also constructed as a nearby spin-off company with the same owners as the Eureka Iron Works. These two foundries were known as the Wyandotte Mills.  Steel rails  Steel rail profile, nineteenth century The Eureka Iron Works company started manufacturing inexpensive steel ingots in 1864. The ingots were made from poured molten steel from Bessemer converters. These converter vessel machines developed steel from molten iron in a heating process that added alloys that improved the strength of the steel. The ingot blocks were about square and long. The ingots were shipped to rolling mills, where they were placed into furnaces and reheated to a white heat. They were then processed through roller machinery that formed steel rails long. These long rails were cut into standard lengths as the final product for constructing railroad tracks. The first Bessemer steel rails ever made in the United States came from the North Chicago Rolling Mill on May 24, 1865. This mill was started by Ward in 1857 to make iron rails. The experimental steel ingots made at the Eureka Iron & Steel Works company at Wyandotte, also controlled by Ward, were shipped to Chicago to be shaped into steel rails since the mill there was already equipped for such production. Six of these first rails made were laid in the track of a railroad running out of Chicago and were still in place ten years later. This was the first time commercial steel was made in America. Steel rails in 1865, at the beginning of manufacturing, sold for $120 a ton. As steel rail production increased at various mills, the average market price settled at $34 per ton.  Demise  The Wyandotte Rolling Mill company was successful in the 1860s, but began to decline after the death of Ward in 1875. It failed in 1877 and the Eureka Iron & Steel Works company took over its operations. The Rolling Mill company was not originally designed for steel production, and instead of changing methods the president of the company decided to move steel production to Chicago. Another reason for the demise of the company was that it consumed 50,000 cords of wood a year for charcoal, an ingredient needed to make iron and steel. When the company ran out of local timber, the cost of shipping charcoal cut into profits. Eventually, there was little need for iron as most merchants preferred steel, which was available from several companies at competitive prices. The Wyandotte Rolling Mills went bankrupt in 1879 and its adjacent land was taken over by the Eureka Iron & Steel Works through a foreclosure process. The Eureka Iron & Steel Works was reorganized in 1883 and became the Eureka Iron and Steel Company. In 1888, a boiler explosion killed three workmen and injured several others, contributing to the company's demise. The company finally went out of business in 1892. The steel manufacturing equipment and factory land were sold at auction.

The upper portion of the Saint John River is integrated into Zec du Lac-Brébeuf, a controlled harvesting zone (ZEC). The Saint-Jean River is served primarily by route 170 (east-west), which passes through the hamlets \\"Le Ruisseau-du-Portage\\" and \\"La Chute-à-Salum\\". Some other secondary forest roads serve the lake area mainly for forestry and recreational tourism purposes. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. The surface of the Saint John River is usually frozen from late November to early April (except in rapids areas), however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-December to late March.  Geography  Three watersheds drain the territory of Zec du Lac-Brebeuf, which are the Saint-Jean rivers and its tributaries, Cami and Catin. The Saint John River rises at the mouth of Brébeuf Lake. This lake has a length of divided into three parts, a maximum width of , an altitude of and an area of . The mouth of the lake is located in a small bay on the east side of the lake, at: * south of Éternity Lake; * south-east of the village center of Saint-Félix-d'Otis; * southeast of a bay of the Saguenay River; * northeast of Lake Ha! Ha!; * southeast of the confluence of the Saint John River and the Saguenay River; * south-east of downtown Saguenay (city); * south-west of downtown Tadoussac. The course of the Saint John River flows over generally to the northeast, according to the following segments: * northeasterly in a marsh zone to the confluence (coming from the south) of the rivière à la Catin; * north-east crossing series of rapids and forming a hook to the north, until bras à Pierre (coming from the south); * north-east to the outlet (coming from the west) of Emmuraillé Lake, near the hamlet \\"La Vallée-d'Amont\\"; * northeasterly to the stream at Denis; * north to Girard Brook (coming from the west); * easterly forming a W at the end of the segment, to the brook of Portage (coming from the south), located in the village of \\"Le Ruisseau-du-Portage\\"; * northerly forming a northwesterly loop to the village of \\"Ruisseau-à-Venant\\", crossing several sets of rapids and forming three loops to the west, then forming a last great loop eastward to the village of L'Anse-Saint-Jean, to its mouth. The mouth of the Saint John River flows to the bottom of Anse Saint-Jean in the village of L'Anse-Saint-Jean on the south shore of the Saguenay River . This mouth is located at: * east of the summit (altitude: ) of the Orange Mountain; * south of the north shore of the Saguenay River (at the level of Portage Cove); * north of the village center of \\"Le Ruisseau-du-Portage\\"; * west of Tadoussac; * east of Saguenay (city). From the mouth of the Saint John River, the current flows through Anse Saint-Jean to northerly, then down the Saguenay River on to the east where flows into the St. Lawrence River at Tadoussac.  Toponymy  The toponym \\"Rivière Saint-Jean\\" appears as early as 1731 in Louis Aubert's Journal de Lachesnaye (transcript of Serge Goudreau). His writing appears in the form of \\"Riviere de l'anse S[ain]t Jean\\" and \\"Riviere S[ain]t Jean\\": \\"I entered the river of the ance S[ain]t Jean [\\"St jean\\" in the manuscript] in the favor of the high pond /.../ When entering the river S[ain]t Jean [\\"St jean\\" in the manuscript], I made /.../\\" [25 August 1731]. The toponym \\"Rivière St-Jean\\" appears in the 1893 report of land surveyor William Tremblay. The toponym \\"Saint-Jean River\\" (Saguenay) was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du QuébecCommission de toponymie du Quebec - Saint Jean River (Saguenay).

His earliest years were spent in Bedgrove, until his family moved to Bicester. He attended the University of Sheffield, where he studied French and Economics.  Career  His professional life began as TV presenter at the BBC and later Channel 5, where he presented that channel's lunchtime news from its launch in 1997 until the end of 2004. In 2005 he founded a communication and lobbying consultancy, which worked with large and small companies around the world, such as the private healthcare company Bupa. In 2010 he joined the lobbying firm Pagefield at its launch, as an associate partner and he was still listed as a specialist partner in their senior advisory team at the time of the 2019 election. During that time Pagefield worked with many different clients, including tobacco giants British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International, as well as multinational arms manufacturer BAE Systems, and the government of Azerbaijan, while its sister company Pagefield Global Counsel provides services to (amongst others) the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

A member of the Labour Party, he was the director of Jeremy Corbyn's 2016 Labour Party leadership campaign. Early life Tarry was born on 28 August 1982 in Westminster, London and grew up in Dagenham, London. The son of The Revd. Canon Gordon Tarry, a Church of England clergyman, he attended Highlands Primary School in Ilford, and St Edward's Church of England School in Romford.  Political career  From 2009 to 2011, Tarry was the Chairman of Young Labour, the youth wing of the Labour Party. Tarry served as a Labour Party Councillor for Chadwell Heath, in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, which he served as from 2010 to 2018. Tarry was criticised for allegedly living in his home in Brighton, which is 70 miles away from his council seat in Barking and Dagenham. Tarry was investigated by police for electoral fraud in relation to this matter. Tarry was cleared by the police investigation, as he was found to own a second home in Barking and Dagenham, and therefore was legally resident in Barking and Dagenham at the time of his election. During this time, Tarry worked with the campaign group, Hope not Hate, where he helped to organise against the British National Party (BNP). Talking about his time organising against the BNP, Tarry talked of how \\"Back home in Dagenham & Rainham, the progressive and unabashedly patriotic messages about restoring dignity and pride ensured that we bit a big enough chunk out of UKIP to match the collapse of many of their voters into an openly hard Brexit Conservative candidates’ hands\\". Tarry speaking in 2016 Tarry worked as the director of Jeremy Corbyn's 2016 Labour Party leadership campaign. Describing his motivation behind serving in this role, he stated that \\"The big lesson I drew from the Iraq War was we not only need to be in power to change things, but we need to be in power in the Labour Party to change things\\". Tarry subsequently worked as the national political officer for the TSSA trade union, and served as the president of the think tank, Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS). In 2017, Tarry stood for selection to be the Labour parliamentary candidate for the Labour seat of Hull West and Hessle. He was the favourite to be selected, on account of his close relationship with Jeremy Corbyn. However, the party selected Emma Hardy, a local teacher and trade union organiser. In 2019, Tarry stood for selection to be the Labour parliamentary candidate for the seat of Ilford South, previously held by Mike Gapes. On 4 October 2019, the evening before members were due to vote, local Redbridge Council leader Jas Athwal was suspended from the party over a serious allegation of sexual harassment. On 22 October 2019, after a postponement of the vote, and with rival candidate Athwal ineligible due to his suspension, Tarry was selected. Parliamentary career Tarry was elected as Ilford South MP in the 2019 general election with a majority of 24,101 votes. After being elected to Parliament, Tarry was appointed to the Transport Select Committee, on which he has been credited as being a \\"passionate advocate for public ownership\\" In this role, he called for the introduction of a death in service payment scheme for London transport workers. He also joined the Socialist Campaign Group of left-wing Labour MPs. During the 2020 Labour leadership election campaign, Tarry said that Keir Starmer would have to show how he would appeal to northern seats that had abandoned Labour, given that he was a \\"north London lawyer\\" and had opposed Brexit. Tarry subsequently supported Rebecca Long- Bailey in the leadership contest.  Comments on antisemitism  During the 2019 general election campaign, Tarry sparked controversy for claiming that \\"people associated with the Labour Party have sought to exploit the issue [of antisemitism] just because they don’t agree with Jeremy Corbyn over an issue of foreign policy\\". The Jewish Labour Movement labelled Tarry's comments \\"beyond disappointing\\". Tarry rebutted allegations that his comments were antisemitic or sought to downplay it, stating that antisemitism \\"is something I care deeply about and would never seek to downplay.\\" In January 2020, Tarry faced criticism for refusing to condemn a motion about the Board of Deputies of British Jews, passed at a branch of the Labour Party in Ilford South. At the meeting, members who spoke against the motion were reportedly called \\"agents of a foreign power\\". The local Labour Councillors released a joint statement, stating that \\"We utterly condemn this motion\\" and stated that they \\"expect swift action to be taken against anyone responsible\\", and the 51 Redbridge Labour Councillors unanimously passed a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to working with the Board of Deputies of British Jews to fight antisemitism and expressing their solidarity to those allegedly subjected to abuse at the meeting. Tarry refused to condemn the motion. Instead he commented \\"there are conflicting accounts of what happened and what was said\\". Tarry later added that \\"the allegations are very serious and should be looked at carefully.\\" and \\"I've asked that any complaints go through the party’s formal channels to ensure that this matter is dealt with thoroughly and impartially.\\" Personal life Tarry is married to paediatrician Dr. Julia Fozard.

The system of bourgeoisie stems from medieval urban law which was common to all the cities of Western Europe (see: Bourgeois of Brussels). The bourgeoisie, or bourgeois commune (i.e. municipality), is a local \\"community\\" that still exists in certain cantons, in which inhabitants originating from that specific commune, called \\"old bourgeois\\", as opposed to the new inhabitants, participate. This current bourgeoisie system, which can be traced back to the law on the communes of 1866, has gradually lost importance. However, these institutions still manage some hospitals and, in some cantons, confer a \\"right to bourgeoisie\\", sometimes prior to Swiss naturalization. This system is linked to the place of origin. There is a \\"Swiss Federation of Bourgeoisies and Corporations\\" whose roles include the defence of \\"maintenance of bourgeois institutions\\". In Switzerland, there was a \\"right to bourgeoisie\\" (a sort of city right), which was a charter of freedoms and rights contracted between the nobility and the bourgeoisie. The prerequisite for belonging to this bourgeoisie was possession of real estate in the heart of the city.http://www.diesbach.com/sghcf/bourgeoisie.html  Cantonal particularities  In the canton of Valais, there are still many active bourgeoisies. Along with the municipal commune that deals with resident citizens, one generally finds the bourgeois commune, whose scope particularly affects the citizens who originate from the municipality with regard to the law on nationality. Thus, one can be Swiss and residing in a municipality, without having the right of bourgeoisie. In contrast, in the canton of Geneva (which replaced the Republic of Geneva), the bourgeoisie of Geneva have had no influence since 1798. The title of bourgeois in Geneva has no value and gives no additional rights since that date.  Honorary bourgeoisie  Honorary bourgeoisie is given to certain people, who strive for the well-being of the country or a municipality. It is not hereditary and has no effect on nationality. Napoleon III was a bourgeois of the municipality of Salenstein.Mémoires & documents publiés par l'Académie chablaisienne The former king of Sweden Gustave IV Adolphe was a bourgeois of the commune of Basel.Nouvelle Biographie Générale by Ferdinand Hoefer  See also  * Bourgeoisie of Geneva * Swiss nobility * Place of origin * Bourgeois of Brussels * Bourgeois of Paris  References  Category:Switzerland Category:History of Switzerland Category:Social class in Europe ","title":"Swiss bourgeoisie"},{"id":"62574535","text":"Juma Al-Rahbi (born 1949) is an Omani sport shooter.

The arena consists of a 9,000-seat multi-purpose arena and an attached conference center. It is home to numerous concerts and events, and was the home of the Huntington Hammer of the Ultimate Indoor Football League for 2011. Marshall University's graduation ceremonies are also held at the arena. It was renamed for sponsorship reason to its current name in 2019. https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/City-of-Huntington-announces-naming-rights- sponsor-for-civic-arena-566092221.html  History  The $10.5 million Huntington Civic Center was completed in 1977 and was the largest in the state of West Virginia when it opened. At the time, the city felt it would not be able to accommodate Marshall University basketball, and the arena was thus built in a location that Marshall objected to, and used a design that was not sports friendly. Marshall thus remained at the older Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse and then constructed its own on-campus arena, the Cam Henderson Center, in 1981. At first the building was very successful; however, the completion of a larger arena in nearby Charleston, and the 25-year delay in construction of what became Pullman Square caused the building to become a money losing effort for the city. The city then decided to turn the building over to private management. From 1993 to 2000, the facility, by then called the Huntington Civic Arena, was home to the Huntington Blizzard of the ECHL. At this time the arena was modified to accommodate hockey and other team sports. In addition, the arena served as the home of the River Cities LocoMotives of the NIFL during their only season in 2001. The facility then served as the home for the American Indoor Football Association's Huntington Heroes. The team moved to the arena after spending their inaugural season in 2006 at the Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse. The naming rights for the arena were purchased by Big Sandy Superstores, a regional chain of furniture and appliance stores, when this deal expired it resumed its generic name for a short time and then the sponsorship rights were acquired by the Mountain Health System, the owners of Cabell Huntington Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center. The facility is currently managed by ASM Global. The Ultimate Indoor Football League chose Huntington, West Virginia as the home of their second team. The team was named the Huntington Hammers.  Renovations  In fall 1997, $3.5 million was allocated in bonds to renovate the aging Civic Center; however, work did not begin until 2000. The 20-year-old facility had not been renovated or maintained since its initial construction. The interior and exterior were repainted in gray and maroon and the leaky roof was repaired. The conference area was expanded and the kitchen facility was upgraded. In late 2011 the building was closed for four months for another renovation, including replacement of all seating. In 2012, the arena purchased the basketball floor from the soon-to-be-demolished Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse. The floor was originally installed in the Cam Henderson Center and was sold to the Fieldhouse when the current Henderson Center floor was installed. At the time the floor was purchased from the Fieldhouse, it still had the markings and logos from Marshall University's Mid-American Conference era.

She worked at Vogue for 36 years altogether, working her way up to the post of fashion director. She was also fashion director for British Elle, working there for seven years. Alongside her two business partners, she created the luxury brand Colville, which launched in 2018. During her career, Chambers has worked with many different photographers including Mario Testino, Patrick Demarchelier and Herb Ritts. She has worked with and photographed models including Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Lily Cole and Naomi Campbell. While working for Vogue and Elle, she was also consulting for fashion houses such as Prada, Jill Sander and Marni, and many high street brands as well as other smaller independent magazines.  Early life  Lucinda Chambers was born in 1959 in Notting Hill, west London. She has a sister from her mother Anne’s previous marriage, who was born ten years prior and a brother, Rourden, who is 18 months older. Chambers father left them which meant that her mother was a single parent and the sole provider. She would buy houses, renovate them and sell them on for a profit. This meant that the family would move every 18 months or so, usually around Knightsbridge and South Kensington. Chambers describes herself as \\"very acquisitive and has been since I was a child\\": on family holidays she would always bring an item back as sentimental value that would remind her of that specific day, admiring the beauty within. This continued as she grew a passion for textiles, when she began collecting eye- catching fabrics when she was 12-13 years old, she would go down to Portobello Market every Friday morning, a tradition she still upholds to this day. She then began to try and design and make her own items such as, accessories for her room, bags, and clothing she first started off making trousers. She would only buy fabrics that would stand out to her, unusual bold fabrics. Her mother is cited to be a big influence on Chambers' creative flair; she taught Lucinda how to sew, embroider and kickstarted her love of interior design. As well as renovating houses, Anne would also offer her sewing services for extra money, for example, every June she would sew all the school uniforms for the local school. With this money she paid the children's school fees. However Lucinda wasn’t always interested in fashion or style, just clothes. She claims that she was more of an ‘underachiever’ at school as she planned on becoming a secretary and getting married after school. However after her father left, there wasn’t enough money for her to enrol in a secretarial course so her mother suggested that they both go to art college. Lucinda went on to study at Hornsey College of Art for a foundation course when she was 18, while her mother went to the London College of Printing at 58 to learn bookbinding. It was at Hornsey College that Chambers realised her interest was with fashion rather than art.  Career  Chambers claimed to hate art college as fashion was seen as being frivolous by staff and students alike, and started making plastic jewellery in another department in her free time. She started off by selling it to friends and local stores. A pair of her earrings were featured in a magazine, which was a breakthrough for her at that time. This was a big factor in her decision to work in the world of magazines. After college, which she finished in 1979, she had a few jobs; including as a sales assistant in Topshop, making theatre costumes for Edinburgh Festival, and working with bin men, as well as continuing to make jewellery. She would make clothes for herself at this time, preferring to use furnishing fabrics. There was a hairdressing studio that she would frequent on Walton Street where she'd let the trainee staff practice on her. Around this time she met photographer Mario Testino when he was just starting out. He was shooting new hair styles for the Ellis Helen studio and Chambers was one of the models. Her multicoloured hair with bleach blonde parts had caused Testino to notice her earlier that day from the top of a double-decker bus. They became close friends with and have been working together since. They first worked together in the early 1980s when Chambers wrote an article about vintage fashion. In March of 1980 she was interviewed by British Vogue for a secretarial job and got it, even though at the time the jobs there were mostly gotten through nepotism. She then worked for the editor, Beatrix Miller, for three years before becoming fashion director Grace Coddington’s assistant. The first shoots she was allowed to do were for Felicity Clark, the beauty editor, who was her boss at the time. Chambers was then commissioned by Beatrix Miller to do a main fashion shoot and was given creative leeway; she could go where she wanted and shoot whoever. Chambers asked photographer Patrick Demarchelier, whom she had worked for as an assistant before, to do the shoot with her. The shoot was a success and both Miller and Coddington loved it. When Elle launched in the UK in September of 1985 by Sally Brampton, Chambers left to become the fashion director there. For her first shoot she went to Morocco with photographer Herb Ritts. She states that \\"Anna Wintour was at British Vogue and she had a very clear vision of what Vogue was going to be like so we scooped up a lot of its old photographers\\". After Wintour left for American Vogue in 1987, Liz Tilberis became the editor at British Vogue and requested Chambers as her fashion editor. For her first editorial for the magazine she again used Patrick Demarchelier. He went with her on a trip to Ladakh (north India) for two weeks to shoot Cindy Crawford, which turned out to be another success. Alexandra Shulman became the new editor in October 1992, and then gave Chambers the position of fashion director in 1997. She held the position for 25 years and overall worked at Vogue for 36 years in total. Chambers worked on the closing ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics, styling nine British supermodels showcasing British designers, such as Burberry, Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. The nine models included Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, as well as seven others. She was offered the opportunity by Kim Gavin, the director of the closing ceremony, who wanted Vogue to help him celebrate British fashion. Photos of the show were taken by Nick Knight and published in the September edition. The process of the event was photographed and documented by Chambers' son, Toby Knott, for Vogue's iPad app. Throughout her career at Vogue she was also a consultant at Prada and Marni and ended up designing for the latter. She also worked alongside Consuelo Castiglioni, the founder of Marni, on its creative direction for over 20 years. She has twice been recognised in the Fashion Awards awarded by the British Fashion Council, receiving the Stylist award in 1999 and 2001.  Controversy  After being sacked from Vogue in May 2017 by Edward Enninful, Chambers gave an interview with Vestoj, which then went viral a month later. In the interview she is very honest about being sacked rather than claiming to have left on her own accord. She also said that she “hadn’t read Vogue in years” and called a Michael Kors t-shirt she had styled on cover model Alexa Chung “stupid” and “crap”. Kors was a big advertiser for the magazine, which was why she had to display his garment. She later stated that the manner in which she said the comments were taken out of context and it was more of a lighthearted conversation where she was trying to be comedic. She has now reconciled with Michael Kors, who invited her to his New York Fashion Week show and put her on front row seats. Anna Wintour was also one of the first people in the fashion industry to reach out to her after the controversy and commissioned Chambers to shoot Pharrell Williams for the December 2017 American Vogue cover.  Career after Vogue  Chambers was approached by former Marni colleagues Molly Molloy and Kristen Forss who wanted to become business partners and create a clothing brand. The name comes from the west London street which artist David Hockney apparently hung out on during the 1970s. This was to be luxury ready-to-wear brand Colville which was launched in May 2018, making its debut in American Vogue. The initial collection was only available via e-tailer matchesfashion.com, which helped the label achieve an exclusive status. The brand offers jumpers, dresses and accessories, as well as more. The three women call their brand a “passion project” and aren’t particularly out to dominate the industry worldwide. Chambers describes the brand as “collaborative, energetic, a bit anarchic, spontaneous and uninhibited”. The brand is also marketed as \\"the antithesis of fast fashion\\". She has an online course on the Business of Fashion website where she teaches ‘Fashion Styling and Image Making’ and also still freelances and consults.  Personal life  She has lived in Shepherds Bush, west London for over 30 years and has three sons from two different relationships. The eldest is Toby Knott, whose father is photographer Kim Knott. The middle son is Theo and the youngest is Gabriel, both of whom are from her marriage with radio producer Simon Crow. As mentioned, Chambers is good friends with Mario Testino, who has been through some controversy himself. He was accused of sexually harassing 13 male models and assistants in March 2018, however Lucinda claims she’s never seen him be inappropriate with anyone and continues to have a working relationship and friendship with him. Patrick Demarchelier has also been accused of sexual misconduct, which he denied. Chambers said “I ran a tight ship on my shoots. I don’t think people would have dared. Only once in my career have I seen a photographer behave toward a model in a way that I considered unacceptable. I stopped the shoot and never worked with him again.”  References  Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:English fashion journalists Category:British fashion designers Category:Journalists from London ","title":"Lucinda Chambers"},{"id":"62574636","text":"Latif Huseynov (; February 1, 1964, Agdam, Azerbaijan SSR) is an Azerbaijan judge, and currently the Judge of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Azerbaijan.

The film tells the story of a young couple who discover a way to fulfil any of their material desires, but then go too far by using it to create a child. It premiered on April 15, 2019 at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. Plot Matt and Kate, a young couple, move to Westminster, Maryland having purchased a secluded manor. While renovating, they discover a large, steel door that leads to an empty room. After experiencing frequent electrical shortages, the couple call an electrician to learn that the wiring in the home is a large, tangled mass that runs along the walls and floorboards of the property. As the electrician drives off, he exclaims his surprise that the property finally sold considering the previous owners were murdered on site. That evening, Matt finds himself unable to sleep and ends up drinking while researching the murder. He learns that the killer's name is John Doe, and that he is still alive, in a psychiatric hospital. He stumbles into the room and drunkenly wishes for another bottle of alcohol, which the room promptly grants him. The next morning, Kate finds Matt in the room surrounded by many expensive paintings. He encourages her to wish for money- and she does, wishing for millions. Over the next several days, the couple quit their jobs and party in the room, which continuously grants their wishes and desires. Kate begins to fall into depression when she realizes that nothing they wish for has any real value, stating that she can just get \\"another, and another, and another\\". To cheer her up, Matt tells her he wants to try for a child, but she becomes angry, reminding him of her two previous miscarriages. She exclaims that she can't put herself through that pain again and storms out of the room. Matt walks past the bedroom moments later to discover that in her sadness, Kate used the room to wish for a son. Panicked, he tells her that what she has done is wrong and that she needs to force the room to take it back. When the couple is unable to bring themselves to wish away the child, Matt leaves the home in search of John Doe. At the hospital, Matt speaks with Doe and doesn't learn much, but is warned that he and his wife should leave the house and forget about the room. Matt drives away only to find that the money he placed in his pocket has turned to ash. He tests his theory at home by placing his Van Gogh painting partially over the threshold. As he suspected, anything that leaves the home experiences rapid aging and decay. Just as he comes to this realization, Kate tells Matt she is taking the baby out for some fresh air. He warns her not to do so but she ignores him, only to panic when the baby quickly ages into a young child. The couple's marriage deteriorates as Kate attempts to parent the child, Shane, while Matt chooses to ignore the child entirely. Kate experiences frustration being inexperienced and unable to properly discipline the child. Shane grows impatient with her as she refuses to let him outside, citing \\"germs and bacteria\\". Days later, Matt finds that Shane has discovered the powers of the room, prompting a tense fight between the couple. They are interrupted by a call from John Doe, who reveals to Matt that he was a child wish granted by the room, and in order for Shane to live, Kate must die. Kate overhears the conversation and flees the home in an attempt to crash her car but cannot bring herself to do so. When she returns, the couple reunite tearfully and have sex in the kitchen, unknowingly being watched by Shane. The next morning, they are awoken by the slamming of the front door and discover that Shane went outside and aged himself into a man, though he still has the mind of a child. He exclaims that Kate lied to him about everything. He threatens the couple with Matt's gun but is distracted by Kate telling him she promised they could be together forever. Matt knocks him to the floor, pushing his wife into the piano during the scuffle. When she awakens, Matt tells her he killed Shane while they fought for the gun. Though she is heartbroken by the news, she accepts the outcome. Later Kate realizes that Matt is Shane in disguise. She pushes him away, but Shane overpowers and attempts to rape her. The real Matt comes to and realizes what happened. Matt tunnels through the walls next to the room and manages to break into the alternate \\"outside\\" that Shane created. He locates their replicated property and breaks into the home just as Shane is assaulting Kate. The two Matts come face-to-face with one another and try to sway Kate to their side. After pushing the fake Matt down the stairs, the couple flees the house makes their way back to the room. They manage to trick Shane into going outside into the real world. Locking the door behind her, Kate watches as Shane ages rapidly and crumbles into ash. Later the couple has abandoned the home and Kate stares at a positive pregnancy test, unsure if the child is Matt's or Shane's.

Born and educated in Wakefield, Ahmad Khan studied at Pushkin Institute and King's College London. He worked for the United Nations as special assistant for political affairs in Mogadishu and as a senior consultant for M&C; Saatchi. A supporter of Brexit, he was elected in the 2019 general election and attributed his victory to voters' support for leaving the European Union in 2016. Early life and career Ahmad Khan was born in Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, where both his parents worked. His father, Dr Saeed Ahmad Khan, was born in the North-West Frontier Province of British India, modern day Pakistan, and worked as a consultant dermatologist. His English mother was a State Registered Nurse and midwife. His grandmother, Joyce Reynolds, also worked at Pinderfields Hospital as a staff sister. His grandfather was a miner. Ahmad Khan attended the local, independent Silcoates School. He studied Russian language at Pushkin Institute in Moscow, and earned a bachelor's degree in war studies at King's College London. He worked for the United Nations as special assistant for political affairs in Mogadishu and as a senior consultant for advertising agency, M&C; Saatchi. Having worked as a counter-terrorism expert prior to becoming an MP, he joked his experience in conflict zones such as Somalia and Afghanistan gives him what would be needed to build bridges between warring parties in the Brexit battle. Political career Member of Parliament Ahmad Khan defeated the incumbent Labour MP, Mary Creagh, to become the first Conservative MP for the constituency in 87 years. He decided to stand after seeing the seeds in Britain of the loss of democracy he had seen abroad. Wakefield voted almost 2-to-1 in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum and was a target seat for the Conservatives. He was selected after the withdrawal of a candidate whose racist and sexist social media posts were uncovered. Labour's Creagh said: \\"Will the next candidate they parachute in be any better? Don’t hold your breath.\\" Ahmad Khan responded by taking part in a skydive over the town and retorted he was \\"a local lad born and bred in Wakefield, of Wakefield stock. I couldn't figuratively parachute in—and I didn't want to disappoint her—so I decided I would literally parachute in.\\" The LGBT+ Conservatives group incorrectly described Ahmad Khan as 'openly gay' and he made news worldwide for becoming the first openly gay Muslim to be elected. They subsequently clarified that Ahmad Khan \\"fully endorses\\" the group's aims \\"but is not an out LGBT MP\\". The confusion arose after a mistaken application to a fund to help LGBT+ Conservative candidates. In his maiden speech in January 2020, Ahmad Khan paid tribute to his predecessor and spoke of his pleasure at being part of \\"a vibrant and dynamic pack of Yorkshire MPs\\". He called for equality of opportunity needs to be made real and more patriotism: \\"I see perhaps more clearly than most the deep and enduring importance of core British values such as compassion, tolerance and fairness, especially at a time when those values are perceived as under threat in many parts of our world.\\" =COVID-19 pandemic response= Ahmad Khan organised a shipment of 110,000 reusable face masks through connections with the charity Solidarités international and the Vietnamese Government. Most of the masks were for the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust's Pontefract, Pinderfields and Dewsbury and District Hospitals and 10,000 were distributed by the trust to local care homes and hospices. He launched 'Wakefield Together' to co-ordinate local efforts to tackle difficulties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Political positions Brexit Ahmad Khan supported Britain's departure from the European Union. In an interview with Channel 4 he attributed his success in the 2019 general election to \\"Islington Remainers\\" who branded Leave voters \\"stupid, uneducated, racist or wrong\\". In September 2020, in a debate about the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, Ahmad Khan declared: \\"I am an ardent supporter of Brexit and look forward eagerly to the opportunity to bolster the United Kingdom’s position by becoming an independent, self-governing nation, possessed of the confidence that flows from our vision and principled values\\". In his speech, he went on to explain his concerns over the Internal Market Bill before backing the legislation. Yorkshire Devolution Movement Ahmad Khan supports the Yorkshire Devolution Movement and called for the devolved West Yorkshire authority to be based in Wakefield. In Rishi Sunak's 2020 Budget, West Yorkshire was allocated £1.8bn with a £317m investment in transport and the election of a Mayor of West Yorkshire, a position which in addition to budgetary control will assume the powers of the West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner. Personal life Ahmad Khan is a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and describes himself as a \\"proud Yorkshireman\\". He has two brothers, Karim Ahmad Khan QC (a barrister specialising in international human rights law) is an assistant secretary-general of the United Nations, appointed by the UN Security Council to lead an investigation into alleged crimes committed by Da'esh/ISIL in Iraq.Michelle Nichols (23 August 2018), U.N. team, approved a year ago, starts work on Islamic State crimes in Iraq Reuters.

NantKwest Inc., 589 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2019 term. In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was not entitled to be reimbursed for attorney's fees from patent applicants who file appeals against USPTO decisions. The case reinforced the application of the American rule, a default principle in United States law which states that, in a lawsuit, each party is responsible for paying its own attorney's fees unless there is a legal or contractual requirement that says otherwise. This case attracted attention from many intellectual property and law associations, many of whom (including the American Bar Association) filed friend-of-the-court briefs arguing against the government's request for attorney's fees from the plaintiff.  Case history  In December 2001, a doctor named Hans Klingemann filed a patent application for a new method of treating cancer using natural killer cells. The patent application concerned a method that used a specific cell line of natural killer cells called NK-92. He then assigned the patent rights to NantKwest, Inc. , California-based immunotherapy firm that is a subsidiary of NantWorks. In 2010, the USPTO issued a final denial of the patent, claiming that Klingemann's method was \\"obvious\\" and not worthy of being patented. The patent examiners noted that medical researchers had, since the 1980s and 1990s, known that natural killer cells could combat cancer cells and that Klingemann's patent application was insufficiently novel to receive a patent. NantKwest appealed the decision internally to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (then known as the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences), which is the internal USPTO administrative board that reviews decisions by USPTO's patent examiners. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences upheld the denial in 2013. NantKwest decided to file its appeal in the District Court under section 145 of the Patent Act, which allows dissatisfied patent applicants to file their appeal in the Eastern District of Virginia, rather than the Federal Circuit (which normally hears appeals of decisions by government agencies). As a district court, the Eastern District of Virginia has original jurisdiction, which allows the litigants to introduce new evidence not considered by the Board of Patent Appeals. This is in contrast to the Federal Circuit, which as an appellate court can only consider evidence that was in the record reviewed by the Board of Patent Appeals.  In lower courts   Trial in the Eastern District of Virginia  The Eastern District of Virginia heard the case in 2016. Prior to discovery, USPTO filed a motion for summary judgment (essentially arguing that the court had enough agreed-upon facts on the record to rule on the case immediately without conducting further proceedings). NantKwest responded to the motion, arguing that it had additional evidence and that there were enough factual disputes left to warrant a full trial. The District Court granted USPTO's motion for summary judgment, ruling in favor of the agency that NantKwest's patent claims were invalid due to obviousness.  First appeal to the Federal Circuit  NantKwest appealed the District Court's decision again, this time to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision in a ruling issued in May 2017.  Motion in the Eastern District of Virginia  Following the Federal Circuit's affirmation, USPTO then filed a motion for reimbursement in District Court of \\"the expenses of the proceedings\\", as permitted by section 145 of the Patent Act. Among those expenses were $78,592.50 of attorneys' fees, which were a pro rata allocation of the three USPTO employees (two attorneys and one paralegal) who worked on the case. The USPTO's position was that the language of section 145, which stated that the applicant had to pay \\"All the expenses of the proceedings\\", entitled it to collect attorneys' fees. The District Court denied USPTO's motion, citing the American Rule. Under the District Court's interpretation of section 145, \\"all the expenses of the proceedings\\" simply referred to the expenses incurred in preparing for the case, such as printing documents, travel costs, and reasonable fees paid to expert witnesses. Without more explicit language in the law, the District Court found that USPTO could not collect attorney fees.  Second appeal to the Federal Circuit  USPTO appealed the District Court's ruling to the Federal Circuit. The case was heard in 2017 by a three- judge panel of the Federal Circuit, which included Chief Judge Sharon Prost as well as Judges Timothy B. Dyk and Kara Farnandez Stoll. In a 2-1 decision issued in June 2017, the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of USPTO. Applying a precedent the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the panel ruled that \\"expenses of the proceeding\\" include a pro rata share of the salaries of USPTO employees who worked on the case. In her dissent, Judge Stoll argued that section 145 lacked the specificity needed to indicate that Congress had the intent to depart from the American Rule and allow for attorney fees to be awarded. She argued that, at the time Congress enacted section 145, the ordinary meaning word \\"expenses\\" did not usually include attorney fees. She also noted that, in other laws, Congress explicitly uses the term 'attorney fees' and often distinguishes between \\"expenses\\" and \\"attorney fees\\".  En banc rehearing by the Federal Circuit  On its own accord, the full Federal Circuit chose to rehear the case en banc—with all active judges on the panel participating (with the exception of Judge Raymond T. Chen, who recused himself since he was once an attorney for USPTO). In a 7-4 opinion released in July 2018, the Federal Circuit reversed the three- judge panel's decision. The court adopted a similar position to Judge Stoll's dissent, ruling that the language of section 145 was not enough to overcome the default American Rule or require that the plaintiffs pay USPTO's attorney fees in addition to the other expenses of the trial.  Appeal to the Supreme Court  USPTO appealed again, this time to the United States Supreme Court. In March 2019, the Supreme Court granted USPTO's writ of certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. Morgan Chu, an intellectual property attorney, represented NantKwest before the Supreme Court. The USPTO was represented by the Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart. The case was argued on October 7, 2019.  Supreme Court opinion  On December 11, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of NantKwest. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor's opinion stated that the reference in section 145 to \\"expenses\\" did not include USPTO's in-house attorney fees. The opinion noted that this was the first time in the history of section 145 that USPTO had requested reimbursement for attorney fees. It also noted that Congress had explicitly included a reference to attorney fees in five other sections of the Patent Act, which meant that their decision not to include an explicit reference to it in section 145 was meant to intentionally exclude them from the definition of \\"expenses\\" eligible for reimbursement.

Effusibacillus was first proposed in 2014 after a strain of bacteria was isolated from the sediment of a freshwater lake. While genetically similar to other members of the family Alicyclobacillaceae, the strain was found to be distinct enough to require its own genus, and was named E. lacus. It was also found that two other previously described organisms in the genus Alicyclobacillus, A. consociatus and A. pohliae belonged in this new genus. The name is derived from Latin effusus (disorderly) and bacillus (small rod), which refers to the various lengths of the cells microscopically. Members of this genus have been isolated from a lake in Japan, a lake in Antarctica, and from the blood of a woman (in a non-infectious capacity). E. lacus and E. pohliae are both thermophiles, with optimum growth temperatures above 50 °C, while the optimum growth temperature for E. consociatus is 30 °C.

Biography Per Kristian Norvik was born in Vadsø, Norway on February 10, 1938. He is the older brother of businessman Harald Norvik and a cousin of politician Erling Norvik. Norvik began his medical studies in 1957, but dropped out in 1959 to become a journalist at Morgenbladet. From 1965 to 1970 he worked at Aftenposten. Since 1970 he worked as editor at Arbeidsgiveren (1970-1972), and as a political journalist at NRK (1972-1978). Norvik joined Verdens Gang in 1978, where he worked as associate editor (1978-1986), and political editor (1986-1993). In November 1993 Norvik left Verdens Gang together with its editor Einar Hanseid, becoming political editor at Aftenposten (1993-2000). He functioned as the acting editor-in-chief at Aftenposten in the absence of Hanseid. As an editor Norvik became well known for his taciturnity and avoidance of the public spotlight, which inspired Norwegian public figures to entrust him with confidential information. He was for many years one of the most prominent political journalists in Norway. Norvik announced his intention to leave Aftenposten in April 2000, in what was considered a surprise move among politicians and fellow journalists. He has subsequently worked as a political commentator at TV 2, TV 2 Nettavisen and Kanal 24.

With Shibi Qaghan  She was inherited by his step-son Shibi Qaghan in 609, in a levirate marriage. She had much influence on khagan, to the point of changing his orders. In the fall of 615, when Emperor Yang of Sui was visiting Yanmen Commandery on the northern frontier, the khagan launched a surprise attack on the area, overrunning most of its Chinese settlements. Warned by the khagan's wife Princess Yicheng — a member of the imperial family who had been well treated by Empress Xiao during an earlier visit — the emperor, empress, and their entourage escaped to the commandery seat at present-day Daixian. The Turks besieged them there on September 11. Resources in seat was small. Emperor was reported to cry out of fear seeing Yuwen suggested Emperor Yang select a few thousand elite cavalry soldiers to attempt a break out, but Su Wei and Fan Zigai (樊子蓋) persuaded Emperor Yang not to attempt this. Emperor Yang put Xiao Yu and Pei Ju in charge of planning the military counteroffensive, but was only able to get the siege lifted after he followed the advice of the empress's brother Xiao Yu and sent messengers to Princess Yicheng, who was directing military affairs at the Turkic capital in her husband's absence. She falsely informed Shibi Khagan that the Turks were under attack from the north, and so the khagan lifted the siege.  With Chuluo Qaghan  She was inherited by Chuluo Qaghan in 619, another step-son.

It is a sequel to the book No Orchids for Miss Blandish by the same author. Summary The book follows events 20 years after those in No Orchids for Miss Blandish, with Ms Blandish's daughter Carol Blandish as the main protagonist, apparently alone and helpless, but with homicidal and aggressive tendencies, who as fate would have it, sets off into the world with unscrupulous people behind her for selfish reasons, and Carol tackling them for survival. With time, from being the 'hunted', Carol soon becomes the 'hunter'. Plot 20 years after the events in No Orchids for Miss Blandish, Miss Blandish's daughter and John Blandish's teenage grand daughter Carol Blandish is lodged in a lunatic asylum. John Blandish refuses to have anything to do with her as she is an illegitimate grand daughter born to his now deceased daughter and Slim Grisson when she was held captive by the latter 20 years ago. Carol is sent to the asylum when she begins to display homicidal tendencies like Slim Grisson and a tendency to attack people's eyes. Nevertheless, John Blandish, before his demise, puts his entire fortune in her name and in the care of a trust that wishes to keep the fortune and ensure that she is confined in the asylum as an 'insane person', lest Carol decides to claim her due inheritance one day. Unfortunately Carol escapes from the Asylum one night, and this sets off many people on her trail - Sheriff Kamp and the psychiatrist who want her back lest she be kidnapped for Blandish's fortune, by the trust lest she become de-certified as a psychiatric patient after 14 days out-of-asylum by law and then come to claim her money, a journalist Phil Magrath who wants to make it big for his paper by grabbing the news first, and soon by ruthless murderers who also want her to claim money. Carol is found by a speeding truck driver in the storm, which she takes over and topples over a valley, killing the driver and going unconscious. She is then found by estranged brothers Steve and Roy, who take her to Steve's cabin. Roy is hiding from Max and Frank Sullivan-the Sullivan Brothers, two dreaded hitmen whose existence is unknown, out to kill him on contract for betraying Roy's boss. Steve nurses Carol to health, who becomes amnesic and falls in love with him. The Sullivan brothers find and attack Steve's cabin and kill Roy. Steve and Carol escape but Steve gets shot. She seeks help, with the Sullivan's behind them. Both are found by Phil Magrath and given shelter. Steve recuperates. The Sullivans hunt for him and Carol as they are now witnesses to Roy's murder. Eventually they locate them lodged in Phil Magrath's mistress home. They attack and kill Steve and break away before the cops arrive, but not before Carol manages to blind Frank Sullivan. Carol is now in custody of Phil who looks after her. But Carol is aggrieved over Steve's death, and vows revenge against the Sullivan brothers. Months later the Sullivans are in another city. Frank Sullivan is blind and having a nervous breakdown, and Max Sullivan is getting tired of him. He continues to work, leaving Frank in a house to take care of himself with a maid. Frank is one day visited by a lady, who befriends him and convinces him to relieve his maid. This lady happens to be Carol Blandish in a new 'Avatar', who has been hunting the Sullivans and has found Frank, who cannot recognise her. She pretends to look after him, takes him and drops him midway in the city traffic, getting him killed by speeding vehicles. Max learns of Frank's death but is remorseless. He eventually learns that Carol Blandish is behind him and Frank for revenge.

Born in Gloucester, Telling became a plasterer. He joined the National Association of Operative Plasterers (NAOP), and began working full-time for the union in Newport, Wales. During World War I, he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was awarded the Military Medal. In 1920, Telling was appointed as Assistant General Secretary of the NAOP, working under T. H. Otley. Otley died suddenly in 1922, and Telling was appointed as acting general secretary of the union, winning an election to the permanent post in September. Telling immediately began reforming the union, ensuring that regional representatives could take seats on the executive, and appointing accountants to audit the union’s accounts, rather than electing members to fill the role. Later, he appointed full-time organisers for every region. Despite many disputes and the depression, membership of the union generally increased under Telling's leadership. In 1936, Telling visited the Soviet Union, but reported back that British building methods were superior. On 29 March 1941, he suffered a serious accident while travelling in a motorcycle sidecar, and took several months' sick leave. While he was off, the union's office was destroyed by bombing during the Blitz. Union membership and finances struggled during the war, but rebounded afterwards, reaching more 19,967 in 1947. Membership then began declining, and in March 1949, Telling reached 65, the set age for retirement from union offices. The process to elect a replacement left him in office for a further year, but an operation near the end of 1949 led him to take several weeks off work. He finally stood down in March 1950. Telling was highly regarded by the union, and was awarded a testimonial cheque for £250. In retirement, he received a pension from the union, but this increased in line with inflation, rather than wage increases in the industry. Telling objected to this and took the union to court, winning the case. Telling was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1950 New Year Honours.

Background MV Camilla Desgagnés docked for refueling. In October 2006, D purchased engine parts for its ship MV Camilla Desgagnés from W. The contract included a limited warranty and limited W's liability to €50,000. The choice of law clause stated that the contract would be governed pursuant to the laws in force at the office of W, which was Montreal. In that regard, a reconditioned crankshaft was mounted onto a new bedplate at W's factory in Zwolle in November 2006 and delivered to the ship at Halifax in February 2007.QCCS, par. 3-4 The crankshaft sustained a catastrophic failure in October 2009, while the vessel was on route on the Saint Lawrence River near Les Escoumins.QCCS, Par. 5 D claimed that the incident arose from a latent defect that arose during the original assembly, which W denied.QCCS, par. 10-11 W also stated that the warranty period specified in the contract had already expired, which was allowed under Canadian maritime law, while D submitted that such limitation clauses are not enforceable in Quebec civil law insofar as they concern latent defects.QCCS, par. 12-15 The courts below At the Superior Court of Quebec, Paquette SCJ stated that the test was, \\"Is the activity at stake so integrally connected to maritime matters such that it is practically necessary for Parliament to have jurisdiction over same, in order to properly exercise its legislative power over navigation and shipping?\\"QCCS, par. 24 She held that it was not, the Civil Code of Quebec therefore applied,QCCS, par. 26-32 and ruled that the contract's limitation clauses were void under and .QCCS, par. 99-104 D was awarded around $5.66 million in damages.QCCS, par. 105 By 2-1, the appeal was allowed at the Quebec Court of Appeal. In the majority ruling, Mainville JA stated that the lower court had erred in law by not noting that Canadian maritime law explicitly included matters concerning the supply of ships as well as their construction and repair.QCCA, par. 89, citing the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7, s. 22(m)-(n) As Canadian maritime law has been held to include the UK Sale of Goods Act 1893QCCA, par. 117-118, noting (under which limitation clauses are allowed in sale contracts),QCCA, par. 139-143 W's warranty expiry was held to be valid.QCCA, par. 144 At the Supreme Court of Canada Appeal was allowed with costs throughout, setting aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring that of the Superior Court.SCC, par. 107 The Justices split 6-3 as to the reasoning behind the ruling, and both sides were at variance with the reasons given by the lower courts. The majority ruling =Scope of Canadian maritime law= The majority began its analysis by first considering the scope of Canadian maritime law, observing that it is: The Court's prior decisions in the field \\"make clear that Canadian maritime law is a comprehensive body of law, uniform throughout Canada, that purports to deal with all claims in respect of maritime and admiralty matters, subject only to the scope of the federal power over navigation and shipping under s. 91(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867\\".SCC, par. 9 It is also a distinct body of law: Besides being \\"a comprehensive body of law\\", it has also been described as \\"a seamless web\\",SCC, par. 15, citing and, \\"where Canadian maritime law does not provide a specific rule governing the situation at hand, courts must extract and adopt relevant principles of law from both the common law and civil law, where appropriate, so as to provide for a coherent resolution to the dispute.\\"SCC, par. 15, citing QNS, p. 725 In 1997, responding to a submission that there was an absence of law concerning a maritime matter, McLachlin J (as she then was) declared: In essence, Canadian maritime law is limited only by the constitutional division of powers. In Ordon Estate, the Court stated that: =Application to the matter at issue= The Court observed that the Court of Appeal's analysis was incomplete, having stopped without considering whether there could be provincial jurisdiction as well in the matter.SCC, par. 81 The majority's division of powers analysis proceeded as follows: {  - !Stage !!Process !! Disposition - valign=\\"top\\" Characterizing the matter at issueSCC, par. 30, citing The court considers the law's purpose and its effect with a view to identifying the true subject matter — the pith and substance — of the law in question. \\"[T]he matter at issue can be characterized, with appropriate precision, as the sale of marine engine parts intended for use on a commercial vessel.\\"SCC, par. 36 - valign=\\"top\\" Classifying the matter according to the different heads of legislative power # The court determines whether the subject matter of the challenged legislation falls within the head of power being relied on to support the legislation's validity. # Where it does, the legislation will be upheld on the basis that it is intra vires, and therefore valid. Application of the \\"integral application\\" test in matters concerning Canadian maritime law, to ensure that federal law does not encroach on matters coming within provincial legislative powersSCC, par. 49 (see ITO at p. 774; Ordon Estate at par. 73) It encompasses a number of non-exhaustive factors, which may receive different weight depending on the facts of a given case, including: # the spatial relationship between the non-maritime and maritime elements of the matter at issue; # the functional relationship between those elements, which involves consideration of, inter alia, whether the activity or good implicates seaworthiness, or, more generally, transportation by water; # the temporal relationship between those elements; # the context surrounding the relationship of the parties to the dispute; # the practical importance or necessity of legal uniformity; # the fact that the matter implicates standards, principles and practices that are specific to the maritime context or informed by maritime considerations; # the historical connection with English maritime law; and # relevant precedents.SCC, par. 56 \\"[T]he sale of marine engine parts intended for use on a commercial vessel is integrally connected to navigation and shipping so as to come within federal legislative authority.\\"SCC, par. 80 - valign=\\"top\\" Is there a provincial law that is valid, applicable and operative? Assess whether the double aspect doctrine may apply  # Regulating the sale of goods constitutes an exercise of the provincial power over property and civil rights # As outlined above, the federal power over navigation and shipping can also apply to the sale of marine engine parts. # Both the Quebec legislature and Parliament have a \\"compelling interest\\" in enacting legal rules over different aspects of the same activity or matter. # The two sets of contract rules and principles are thus valid. # Therefore, the CCQ can govern this sale of marine engine parts unless an issue of applicability or operability arises.SCC, par. 85 - valign=\\"top\\" Does the interjurisdictional immunity doctrine apply? Two conditions must be met for the doctrine to apply: # the impugned provision must trench on the core of an exclusive head of power under the Constitution Act, 1867 # the effect of this overlap must impair the exercise of the core of the head of power The doctrine must be limited to situations already covered by precedents. In this case: # the contractual issues raised by D's claim do not engage the core of the federal competence over navigation and shipping; and # the core of navigation and shipping neither can nor should be defined in a manner so as to necessarily encompass contractual issues related to the sale of marine engine parts for use on a commercial vessel.SCC, par. 92, 94 - valign=\\"top\\" Does federal paramountcy come into play? Assess when valid provincial and federal legislation are incompatible. If such a conflict exists, the federal law prevails and the provincial law is declared inoperative to the extent of the conflict. The Sale of Goods Act 1893 is not per se an Act of the Parliament of Canada, as it functions as part of the non- statutory portion of Canadian maritime law. \\" In our view, it would run contrary to the purpose of the federal paramountcy doctrine to declare that the non-statutory rules of Canadian maritime law can prevail over valid provincial legislation.\\"SCC, par. 103 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Conclusion - valign=\\"top\\" colspan=\\"3\\"In the present case, \\"is therefore operative and governs the dispute ... as it prevails over Canadian non-statutory maritime law following the principle of the primacy of a legislative enactment.\\"SCC, par. 106 } The concurrent ruling The minority held that jurisdiction was ultimately based on an analysis of its pith and substance, and stated that both courts below had erred in their application of the test.SCC, par. 130 In the present case, it is the \\"pith and substance\\" test, and not the \\"integral application\\" test, that \\"must be used to determine whether a matter comes within navigation and shipping or property and civil rights.\\"SCC, par. 131 It also expressed the idea that it may now be time to lay the \\"integral application\\" test to rest.SCC, par. 142-146 It noted that the Sale of Goods Act 1893 in the English courts was applied by the King's Bench Division, as opposed to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and was thus never part of the admiralty law considered by the latter Division. It therefore did not arise in the present context, and so the property and civil rights power within provincial jurisdiction applied.SCC, par. 186 It further clarified that its ruling did not express an opinion as to whether Parliament could pass legislation with respect to contracts of trade at sea, or whether the \\"double aspect\\" doctrine could possibly apply.SCC, par. 190 Impact One commentator noted that this decision \\"has potentially far- reaching implications for contracts and disputes involving the transportation of goods across borders and the construction of projects under federal jurisdiction.\\" Another thought that \\"maritime lawyers and constitutional experts are going to be parsing this decision for years\\". Desgagnés departs from prior jurisprudence of the SCC in the field that held that maritime law must be uniform throughout Canada, and by implication allows for provincial legislation to apply to contracts in industries otherwise governed by federal law. The Court's observation that the paramountcy doctrine did not apply where the Parliament of Canada has not legislated on a particular aspect is seen as an invitation for such action to take place. By holding that Canadian maritime law is a body of law separate from either common or civil law, and that the dispute could have been avoided by a more precisely worded choice of law clause, parties to future maritime contracts will need to carefully consider consequences of their drafting. However, the Civil Code of Quebec could conceivably prohibit relying on such a clause, as a matter of public order.

Early life and education Born with multiple physical disabilities — short forearms, no hands, a deformed left knee, and a short right leg stump — Safiya was adopted at the age of three by Sabah al Bahlani, a single mother. Sabah al Bahlani had been trained in the United States as a Community Health Educator and was working at the time for the Ministry of Health in Oman in a program to educate parents about children with disabilities. Sabah took Safiya to the United States with her when she went to continue her studies. In the United States, Safiya al Bahlani was given intense speech therapy. She had speech difficulties as a child and when tested was found to be totally deaf in one ear, as well as tongue-tied. Al Bahlani also had surgery to make it easier for her to wear a prosthetic. In school, Safiya excelled in the arts. She had been drawing since she was a child, but it was when she turned fourteen that she realized that she want to become a professional artist. After graduating from the American International School of Muscat, she continued to study graphic design. When she moved to Jordan in 2007, she chose to change her interest of study to animation, but she continued to paint and held her first solo art exhibit in Jordan with 38 pieces that she had collected in February 2010. Career Al Bahlani returned to Oman and was looking for a job when she met an Omani fashion designer. Together they created an exhibit of 40 paintings and 20 dresses based around a theme of His Majesty's Annual speeches. She felt that doing oil and acrylic paintings of the designs was not creative enough; she embellished the paintings with embroidery and traditional Omani tassels. This exhibit was held in March, 2011. Her second solo exhibit, 'The Growing Journey', was held in December of 2012, at the Bank Muscat and included over 70 paintings. In 2016 she had a solo exhibition, entitled 'Flashback' at the Centre Franco-Omanais. Al Bahlani opened her own gallery, which launched with artwork created in collaboration with a jewellery designer, Hannah Al Lawati. In 2018 Al Bahlani was selected to create visual designs and branding for Al Mouj Muscat’s environmentally-responsible transportation buggies.  Speaker  Al Bahlani has spoken a number of times on the subject of being a creative artist and a person with disabilities. Her first TEDx talk, \\"The chosen: Sabah al Bahlani and Safiya al Bahlani\\" was at TEDx Muscat in November of 2013. In this talk, she and her mother spoke about the circumstances that brought them together and how they feel that everyone has a unique purpose. Her next TEDx talk, \\"Challenge is Your Weapon\\" was at TEDx Institute Le Rosey in January, 2014.

His main title was that of a great one of the leaders of craftsmen, that in later periods is the main designation of the High Priest of Ptah. Ptahshepses is mainly known from a false door that is today in the British Museum (Inv. no. EA 862), but coming from his tomb. A smaller fragment of the door is kept in the Oriental Institute Museum (Inv. no. 11084) in ChicagoPeter F. Dormanː The Biographical Inscription of Ptahshepses from Saqqaraː A Newly indentified fragment, inː Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 88 (2002), 95-110 He is also known from statues and had a mastaba at Saqqara (mastaba C 1).Auguste Mariette, Gaston Maspero: Les mastabas de l'Ancien Empire: Fragment du dernier ouvrage de A. Mariette, publié d'après le manuscrit de l'auteur. F. Vieweg, Paris 1889, 110-114 His false door bears a long biographical inscription and reports main events in his life. Ptahshepses was born under king Menkaure and educated at the palace. Under Userkaf, he married the eldest king's daughter Khamaat. He lived at least till the reign of Niuserre as he was priest at his sun temple, named Shesepibre. The name of the latter king is not preserved in the biography. On the lintel of the false door appears the underworld god Osiris in the offering formula. Osiris is otherwise not well attested in the Fifth Dynasty and there is a scholarly debate going on, about the first mentioning of Osiris in Ancient Egyptian sources. Depending on the life time of Ptahshepses, his inscriptions might be the earliest evidence for this deity.

Mark Twain mentions \\"Sam Brown\\" among 11 names of notorious killers in Nevada during the 1860s. For a brief time, Sam Brown is alleged to have been the most notorious desperado in Virginia City. In the American West of that time, outlaws often used aliases and their exploits were often exaggerated by themselves and by tellers of tall tales. Newspaper accounts might have subordinated the truth to telling a good story, selling newspapers, and maintaining a good image for influential people, such as saloon keepers and lawyers. According to Mark Twain, According to Myron Angel's history, in defending his claim in Fiddletown, California in 1854, Sam Brown was convicted of killing three Chileans and wounding a fourth and served two years in San Quentin State Prison. The accounts of Brown's death suggest that in celebrating his 30th birthday he became drunk and started a fight with Henry Van Sickles, who chased him on horseback and then shot him dead.

Steve Anderson and Lev H. Prichard, Sr. The partnership was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 30, 1922. History Lev H. Prichard, Sr., previously had organized the Caddo Petroleum Company in 1918 along with his partners, A.P. Crockett, J.B. Allen, and Walter \\"W.R.\\" Ramsey. By August 1920, J. Steve Anderson joined the company as Vice President, and Lev Prichard was promoted from Vice President to being President. Paul Anderson served as Comptroller. The Anderson and Prichard families owned 63% of the Caddo stock by this time. Due to various setbacks, the Caddo company was eventually shut down and liquidated shortly after June 21, 1921. However, separately from the Caddo company, on October 6, 1920, Anderson-Prichard & Co. (\\"AP&C;\\") had been incorporated in Delaware, with an authorized capital of 100,000 shares of no par value stock. Although incorporated in Delaware, AP&C; maintained its principal offices at the Colcord Building in Oklahoma City. AP&C; assumed control of the Cyril Refining Company of Cyril, Oklahoma, but due to poor capitalization and debt that had been taken on to obtain services and equipment, AP&C; was liquidated in January 1922. In June 1922, Anderson and Prichard formed the \\"APCO Refining Company\\" (Apco), the Cyril refinery asset. The refinery was operated in the name of the Apco Refining Company until February 26, 1923, when all of the company's stock was sold to the latest business entity of the partners, the Anderson-Prichard Oil Corporation, which had also been separately organized and incorporated in Oklahoma in June 1922, with an authorized capital of 1,000 shares of $100 par value stock. The Anderson-Prichard company used the \\"APCO\\" brand name on a very limited basis, off and on, over the years due to uncertainty regarding having clear trademark rights. Another company had used the mark in the same or related industry designation, so Anderson-Prichard avoided any widespread use, opting instead to use their \\"Anderson-Prichard\\" name in combination with other brand names, such as with \\"Challenge Gasoline\\" and \\"Defiance Oil\\". The Kan-O-Tex gasoline brand name and reporting mark were acquired by the Anderson-Prichard Oil Corporation in October 1953 and were likely continued in use for a while before being replaced by Anderson-Prichard's main brand usage. After companies that had previously used APCO variants had trademarks canceled for non-use, Anderson-Prichard filed a trademark application in 1941. But, in 1943, Anderson-Prichard was informed that the American Oil Company had objected to the application because they felt it was too similar to their \\"AMOCO\\" brand name. However, by February 1954, Anderson-Prichard company negotiated an agreement with the American Oil Company that allowed them to use the APCO branding under geographic limitations, and design limitations that would keep the respective companies' logos visually distinct. Anderson-Prichard Oil Corporation would proceed increasingly to brand its products and gas stations with the APCO logo thereafter. Lev Prichard bought out J. Steve Anderson's stock in the company in 1947. Lev H. Prichard died from cancer in 1949. By 1955, the company was listed on the Fortune 500 based upon $54.7 million in revenues, assets of $55.4 million. In 1960 the bulk of the company's assets sold for $123.3 million to four investor groups, including Occidental, Seagram, and Brookston Oil. One part which included Anderson-Prichard marketing and distribution units was incorporated in Delaware as a completely new company, named \\"APCO Oil Corporation\\". Cultural references The Ramsey Tower in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, completed in 1931, was for a period of time widely referred-to as \\"APCO Tower\\", while the Anderson-Prichard Oil Corporation was headquartered there. The building is now known as the \\"City Place Tower\\". The W.S. Kelly Gas Station & General Store was an Anderson- Prichard gas station located in Cogar, Oklahoma, and appeared in a scene in the film, Rain Man, starring Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. The \\"APCO Petroleum Products\\" road sign can be seen in the film in a scene where the two protagonists stop to use the phone booth.

In its general idea, it is a compromise between government control and privatization. A UWF is an investment fund that is set up to manage the assets of a city, often with the objective of maximizing return on the assets as a means of generating revenue for the city government. As a result, this will enable cities to increase their investments (for example for infrastructure projects) without increasing taxes.  General information  Its operation is similar to a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) but on a smaller scale. A UWF has an asset manager concerned with managing a portfolio of operational assets. The funds are publicly owned by the city but administered by an independent management structure that is free from political influence and concentrates on maximization of value, which is useful for when assets are not ‘routine’ real estate such as docklands or old sport stadiums. The fair market value of assets can be difficult to determine since they may have no active market whose prices can provide effective guidance for the valuation of the property. In addition to the professional management of assets, such funds protect cities from short-sighted politically inspired measures, such as selling properties to resolve liquidity problems. For Detter and Fölster the core idea of the Urban Wealth Fund can be summarized by 5 key points, which are simple in design but may be difficult to execute: * Value: Local governments are still the largest holder of wealth within city borders (for example real estate, transportation systems, utilities and state owned enterprises) * Transparency: Due to poor accounting techniques, many cities are unable to present a comprehensive list of all their assets. As a result, cities can neither manage effectively nor optimize their assets * Return Opportunity: Even a small increase of the return on public assets would contribute significantly to the city's budget and thus decrease the need to raise taxes while also allowing for increased investments into, for example, infrastructure * Politicians vs. public management: The clear distinction between politicians and asset management can have a salutary effect on democracy as it removes politicians from their position as asset gatekeepers and turns them into citizen advocates on behalf of public asset productivity and quality * Mechanisms: Professional asset management is linked to stronger economic performance Some economists and politicians advocate for the establishment of UWFs as a means of making more efficient use of city-owned assets, such as land, in order to generate revenue without necessarily resorting to tax increases or running up debts. The positive examples of Copenhagen and Hamburg suggest that the concept can be successful despite the numerous differences between the UWF structure. However, McNickle notes that there is a dearth of scholarly literature casting any sort of critical eye on UWFs.  Examples  Examples for the creation of UWF can be found all over the world and include HafenCity GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, City & Port Development Corporation in Copenhagen, Denmark, MTR Corporation Limited in Hong Kong, Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, Philadelphia, United States and Temasek Holdings, Singapore. The individual characteristics and responsibilities of these UWFs differ significantly.  Copenhagen City and Port Development Corporation  The Copenhagen City and Port Development Corporation, fully owned by the City of Copenhagen and the state of Denmark, was created in 2007 when multiple development areas around Copenhagen (most importantly the port and Ørestad) were consolidated under one entity. CPH City and Port Development was established with the explicit purpose of using the revenues of redevelopment to finance the construction of infrastructure (especially the CPH metro line). It accomplishes this task through the use of smart valuation techniques and low-cost financing using the assets as collateral. For example, the re-evaluation of one of the biggest assets, the land of North Harbor, increased its value by €450 million. In total, the redevelopment of North Harbor led to investments of €15 billion. Katz and Noring analysed the political, institutional and financial features of the Copenhagen model: = Political Features = * Compromise and Collaboration: Denmark, due to its small size and population, has a collaborative tradition with a very flat power hierarchy. There is a great understanding that if you want to develop something, you must collaborate. * Decentralized Governance: The Danish System of decentralised government allows municipalities to operate independently from the national government. Denmark is the most decentralized OECD country with 60% of government spending is accounted for by local government. Motto: Whoever gets to decide on an investment, needs to finance the investment. * Board Composition: board members are elected by the national government (2), the city of Copenhagen (4) and its employees (2) = Institutional Features = * Bundling assets by merging public companies: CPH City & Port Development was created through consolidation of pre-existing public corporations. With fragmentation, local governments lose sight of their assets and are forced to make decisions in a piecemeal fashion. * Maximising benefits of public ownership and private management: It combines the efficiency of market discipline with the benefits of public direction and legitimacy. This model allows both sectors to focus on their core competencies. As a result, operations run faster and more efficient and allow the city to set ambitious targets. * Insulation from political interference: Its structure ensures that the fund can run independently from political interference. It is governed by national law and operates under the mandate to optimize commercial gains in order to generate profit for the city of Copenhagen. * Organizational structure and joint ventures: Flat organisational structure allows fast decision-making. Departments can work independently and only report to a CEO. When joint ventures are created, the power of operations is delegated even further away from the board of directors. = Financial features = * Access to cheap financing: Thanks to high credit ratings of its owners, CPH has easy access to cheap financing, “The access to cheap loans and the ability to keep operating despite massive debts is the single most important feature of CPH City & Port Development,” Koch said. “Without that, we would have shared the destiny of other property developers during the recent recession, as we are just as vulnerable to market dynamics as other property developers.” * Long-term thinking: By acting like a private company, they have to think long-term. This prevents the public agency fallacy from selling out assets whenever the public agency lacks liquidity. * Collaboration with Pension funds: Large Danish pension funds are important partners of CPH and share the company's long-term vision and investment horizon.  HafenCity Hamburg GmbH  Since 2004, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH is the operational corporation in charge of managing all assets and overseeing the urban redevelopment of HafenCity. The UWF is called 'Special Fund for City and Port', which consists of land owned by the City of Hamburg located in the HafenCity area (97% of all properties in HafenCity area). The redevelopment of HafenCity relies entirely on HafenCity Hamburg GmbH, which either sells properties or solicits loans from commercial banks using the assets of HafenCity as collateral. The capital is then mainly used for infrastructure and basic amenities, notably roads, bridges, squares, parks, quays, and promenades. In addition to its financial tasks, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH clears and prepares sites, acquires real estate developers and is responsible for public relations and communications. Similar to the CPH, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH benefits from the high credit rating of the city of Hamburg. As a result, it is one of the few European megaprojects which does not receive EU funds and almost no federal budgetary support. When completed, the HafenCity development areas will become home for approx. 23,000 people and create approx. 71,000 jobs. In comparison to CPH, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH has less responsibilities and tasks. While CPH is responsible for the construction of the whole metro system in Copenhagen, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH only finances the urban regeneration within the HafenCity area. Further, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH requires annual budgetary approval by the city of Hamburg and is not allowed to engage in joint ventures with private developers and investors. Nonetheless, both projects share one crucial characteristic: the bundling of public assets and the management of such assets through one organisation that is granted significant freedom of operation in the market economy. This ensures that the long-term plans are not endangered by political shifts in local government and that the corporation has the needed agility to operate in market economies.  MTR Corporation Limited  MTR Corporation Limited (originally, Mass Transit Railway Corporation) was established in 1975 and tasked with managing and operating the rail transit system, the adjacent land and most of the adjacent real estate. In 2000, MTR was partially privatised. While the railway system itself is profitable, most MTR's profits derive from property development and other commercial activities, such as leasing of retail space or personal telecommunication services. As a result, MTR pays a substantial dividend to the city, which has been used to pay off existing debt and to develop other assets. Similar to CPH in Copenhagen, the UWF is used to ensure high quality public transport, while also increasing the living standard in Hong Kong.  Critics  As the concept of UWF is relatively new, McNickle notes that there is a dearth of scholarly literature casting any sort of critical eye on UWFs. He argues that the UWF structure is too complicated and local governments are better off selling assets and outsourcing services, keeping the government as small as possible.

The company was established after the original Telltale Games filed for assignment in October 2018 and were forced to shut down and sell off assets. LCG Entertainment had been able to acquire the rights to much of the original Telltale intellectual property (IP), including branding, games, and game licenses, and announced in August 2019 they would be bringing the old Telltale Games titles back. History Founding The original Telltale Games had become an established studio in producing episodic adventure games. While its earlier titles were modest successes, the studio had become successful with its release of the licensed property The Walking Dead in 2012. The Walking Dead helped Telltale establish major licenses from other franchises, among which included Batman and the Fables comic. While the studio continued to build on its successes, the period leading up to 2016 created a lot of internal strife within Telltale, focusing on quantity of titles released over quality, and led to underperforming sales of hastily-produced titles. A major shift in leadership occurred in 2017 to try to refocus the company on improving the quality, with The Walking Dead: The Final Season (the fourth in the series) aimed to demonstrate this new approach while the company worked on improving their financial situation. However, after a few major deals fell through in September 2018, Telltale announced its immediate closure, cancelling all current projects, and by October 2018, had filed for assignment. Several of the licensed properties were taken back by the IP owners; notably The Walking Dead games were acquired by Skybound Entertainment, and the company brought in much of the former Telltale staff to complete The Final Season within 2019. LCG Entertainment was incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law on December 27, 2018, with Jamie Ottilie and Brian Waddle acting as chief executive officer and chief revenue officer, respectively. In February 2019, the company started to negotiate with Sherwood Partners, the company managing the liquidation of Telltale's properties, to acquire much of remaining Telltale licenses and games. Negotiations took over six months, complicated by the number of companies involved in the IP rights. LCG gained a number of investments to help secure the purchase, including Athlon Games and video game industry figures Chris Kingsley, Lyle Hall, and Tobias Sjögren. The acquisition was completed by August 2019. Athlon Games also became a shareholder in the company as part of the deal. On August 28, 2019 LCG publicly announced the acquisition of much of the Telltale Games assets, and that it would be doing business as Telltale Games in the future. Among the company's plans were to republish the back catalog of Telltale Games they had acquired, working with Athlon Games as a publishing partner. The company had also sought to bring back former Telltale employees to support these efforts. Subsequently, the company took over the current publishing support of those games it has acquired the license to for digital platforms such as Steam. Some concern was raised on this announcement in the gaming industry, with some believing that the new company should pay all the debts incurred to the former Telltale Games staff or offer positions to all former employees, while others had called for a boycott on any games released by this company. Ottilie stressed that he had no ties with any of the former Telltale management, nor was in a financial position to meet some of these demands, stating \\"we cannot right the wrongs of the former company\\". The company's goal was to start small with a staff of about 30 to 35 people by the end of 2020, using freelancing and outsource contracting until the company established itself, and then expand out. Ottilie asked critics to give them a chance, \\"Give us some time to ramp up and then judge us by the work we do, not by a past over which we had no part or control.\\" To avoid the issues that plagued the former Telltale, Ottilie said that they will be making sure their business practices are sustainable, not growing too fast to be able to manage costs better. The new company wants to avoid a crunch time environment, \\"taking a measured and methodical approach to growth in order to ensure we can provide a stable, non-crunch work environment. We are building this into our culture from the outset.\\" Ottilie also said that while they plan to stay with the episodic release format established by the original Telltale, that in terms of development, they will see such series as a full game from the development side: \\"If we do release the game in episodes, all of them will be ready before the first one hits the store.\\" Publishing While licenses for games and planned games like The Walking Dead and Stranger Things have since reverted to their original owners, the new Telltale retains licenses for The Wolf Among Us and Batman, as well as the intellectual property for Puzzle Agent. The new Telltale announced its first two new releases in December 2019. The first was a rerelease of Batman: The Telltale Series and Batman: The Enemy Within with a new \\"Shadows Edition\\", first released in December 2019. This included both games and added a new noir-like graphics filter, among other quality-of-life improvements. The added filter was also made available as paid downloadable content for those that already owned the game. The second announcement was made at The Game Awards 2019 for The Wolf Among Us 2, a sequel to The Wolf Among Us. While the old Telltale had planned and started work on a sequel to the game, all work had been cancelled when the company closed down. For the revived sequel, the new Telltale brought on AdHoc Studio, a studio formed by former members from Telltale, who will focus on the game's narrative and cinematics, while Telltale will handle the gameplay and transition to the Unreal Engine.

Early life Cromwell was born in Brooklyn, New York on April 24, 1871. He was the eldest son of Esther Whitmore (née Husted) Cromwell (1846–1909) and Frederic Cromwell (1843–1914), a trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance Company. His younger brother was Ellis Bowman Cromwell, who died aged 17 in 1892, and his younger twin sisters, Dorothea Katharine Cromwell and Gladys Louise Husted Cromwell. Another sister, Mary Cromwell lived at 46 Rue Spontini in Paris. During World War I, twins Dorothea and Gladys volunteered with the Red Cross and, reportedly due to the strain of the hospital work, the 22 year-olds committed suicide in January 1919 by jumping from the deck of La Lorraine as the steamer was in the Garonne river and they were on their way home to New York. Three months later they were buried in France with military honors and the French Government awarded them the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Reconnaissance française.\\" His paternal grandparents were Mary Jane (née Kendall) Husted and Seymour Legrand Husted, one of the wealthiest men in Brooklyn who served as president of the Brooklyn City Railroad and of the Dime Saving Bank. Cromwell received his education at Harvard College and the University of Berlin. Career After college, Cromwell worked for railroad, banking and industrial corporations in clerical capacities. In 1896, he began his career on the Stock Exchange as a partner in the firm of Strong, Sturgis & Co., remaining with them until January 1, 1925. During Spanish-American War, Cromwell fought with Troop A (Squadron A). In recognition of his work with French orphans after World War I, he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor by the French Government. In April 1921, he was selected to succeed William H. Remick as president the New York Stock Exchange. Cromwell, a member of the Exchange since 1896, had previously been on the Board of Governors of the Exchange since May 1914. He served three terms as president and was succeeded by Edward H. H. Simmons in May 1924. While president of the Exchange, he was focused on ways to end stock swindles, and was noted \\"for his campaign against bucket shops.\\" Through his efforts, he caused the Better Business Bureau of New York to be formed. In 1925, Cromwell advanced the idea that Wall Street was \\"making 'vital efforts to realize in fact many of the aims so much talked about during the war, and the economic and social ideals urged by the liberals.'\\" Later career After his retirement from the presidency of the Exchange, he focused on his own business as a partner in the firm of Strong, Sturgis & Co., with offices as 11 Wall Street. On January 1, 1925, he became a member of the odd lot brokerage firm of Carlisle, Mellick & Co., with offices at 41 Exchange Place. Personal life On November 29, 1899, Cromwell was married to Agnes Mabel Whitney (1874–1959), a suffragist who later became a poet and author. A descendant of prominent merchant Stephen Whitney, Agnes was a daughter of Stephen Suydam Whitney and Josephine (née Thomson) Whitney. She was a niece of Mary Stuart Whitney Kernochan (wife of J. Frederic Kernochan) and among her siblings was sister, Mary Stuart Whitney (wife of Robert Livingston Stevens; son of Edwin Augustus Stevens and Martha Bayard Stevens) and brothers, New Jersey Senator Arthur Whitney and Stephen Suydam Whitney Jr. (husband of Louise Mott Bell; niece of Isaac Bell Jr. and great-granddaughter of Dr. Valentine Mott). Together, they were the parents of four sons: * Frederic Cromwell (1900–1973), who married Caroline Cooper Prentice (1901–1957) in 1923. They divorced in 1925 and he remarried Cornelia Livingston (1903–1975), a daughter of Goodhue Livingston, in 1927. In 1947, they too divorced, and in 1948 he married Iris Barnett Lyon. * Seymour Legrand Cromwell Jr. (1902–1965), who married Leta Clews (1912–1991), a grandniece of Henry Clews, in 1936. They divorced and he remarried to Olivia (née Morgan) Knight (1916–1972), the widow of Harry Hall Knight, in 1951. * Whitney Cromwell (1904–1930), who died of pneumonia while on vacation in Tunisia at the age of 25. A graduate of Harvard, he was studying at the École des Beaux- Arts in Paris before his death. * John Cromwell (1914–1979), an actor and playwright who made his Broadway debut in 1935 in the play The Old Maid. In New York City, they resided at 169 East 74th Street (previously at 8 East 53rd Street), and had a country estate in Mendham, New Jersey that was gifted to Cromwell in 1892 by his father. The 112-acre estate featured a forty-seven room Georgian-style mansion in Somerset Hills, New Jersey. In 1927, his widow sold their New Jersey estate to the Sisters of Christian Charity (as a retreat and guest house) for $50,000, and later moved to 993 Park Avenue. Cromwell died at the Morristown Hospital on September 16, 1925, at the age of 54, after he was thrown from a horse while riding near Bernardsville. The Exchange closed so members could attend his services at St. Bartholomew's Church, followed by burial at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. His wife inherited his whole estate. After his death, his widow \\"maintained her civic commitments, supporting women's issues as well as national and local unemployment relief efforts\\" before her death on May 15, 1959. She was the first woman to serve on the New Jersey State Board of Education and the first on the New Jersey State Hospital Board. Descendants Through his eldest son, he was a grandfather of champion oarsman Seymour Legrand Cromwell II (1934–1977), a Princeton graduate and naval architect who helped the United States win a silver medal in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.

A prominent figure in news journalism and major reporting, she was an anti-fascist and feminist activist who was part of the French group associated with the World Committee Against War and Fascism. Viollis worked for various newspapers, including La Fronde, L'Écho de Paris, Excelsior, Le Petit Parisien, The Times, Daily Mail, Vendredi, Ce soir, and L'Humanité. She received several awards, including the Legion of Honour. Early life and education Andrée Françoise Claudius Jacquet de la Verryere was born in Mées, December 9, 1870, to a cultivated bourgeois family. After obtaining her baccalaureate, she studied at the Sorbonne and graduated from the University of Oxford. Career After graduation, she turned to journalism and made her debut in the feminist newspaper La Fronde, directed by Marguerite Durand. She married Gustave Téry, professor of philosophy, with whom she had two children, including Simone Téry. In 1903, when Simone was four, Andree divorced Gustave. In 1905, she married Henri d'Ardenne de Tizac, curator of the Musée Cernuschi and author of novels under the pseudonym of Jean Viollis. They had two other children. With her second husband, she became involved in literary journalism as a critic, columnist, serialist, and storyteller; they also co-authored novels. Viollis affiliated with L'Écho de Paris and Excelsior, writing in favor of women's emancipation and the rights of the mother. From 1914, she worked at the newspaper Le Petit Parisien, staying twenty years, where she turned to major reporting and covered diverse areas, including sporting events, major trials, political interviews, and war correspondence. During World War I, for the period of 1914 to 1916, she served as a nurse at the front, as well as at Bar-le-Duc and Sainte-Menehould. Seule en Russie (1929) In 1919 and until 1922, she served as editorial assistant to The Times and the Daily Mail.

During the Popular Front, she joined forces with anti-fascist intellectuals. With the support of André Chamson and Jean Guéhenno, she became the director of the weekly political-literary Vendredi, where she defended the cause of the Spanish Republic and of the victims of French colonization. Viollis was part of the French group associated with the World Committee Against War and Fascism. In 1936, in Paris, she chaired the first congress of the Union des jeunes filles de France. In 1938, she joined the editorial staff of the communist daily Ce soir, edited by Louis Aragon and Jean-Richard Bloch. After Vendredi ended publication in November 1938, she joined La Lumière, along with Louis Martin-Chauffier and André Wurmser. Close to communist intellectual circles, she joined the Resistance in the southern zone during World War II, and put her journalist experience to work for this commitment, spending the war years in Lyon and Dieulefit. Later life and death In 1945, Andrée Viollis worked again with Ce soir. She also collaborated with some publications of the communist movement. She took up major reports, which leads her to travel to South Africa. In the same year, she was sent by L'Humanité to the United States to cover the French section of the Office of War Information.

The structure constitutes an architural complex of the 18th century and predominantly Neoclassic style punctuated by baroque expressions and motifs. The construction of the building is intimately related to a few historical contingencies that have witnessed the Palace's extensive erection process. History Atlas of the topographic map of Lisbon, Filipe Folque 1856-1858 The Grilo Palace is set upon a pre-existent palatian structure located at the Grilo Farm that previously belonged to D. António de Mascarenhas. The exact date of construction concerning the pre-existing palatian structure is unknown. This farm was constituted by a very large land property that ascended the uphill pronounced slope, known today as Dukes of Lafões Sidewalk. Following Lisbon's massive earthquake on 1 November 1755, it is attributed to D. Pedro Henrique de Bragança having refused to light up his residence on the occasion of the marriage between the Infant D. Pedro III and the king's eldest daughter and future queen, D. Maria I, princess of Brazil. This episode has made the Palace famous. The Duke D. Pedro Henrique de Bragança was one of the only two pretenders to the princess's hand, and consequently also to the Portuguese throne as consort king. It's important to understand that this particular occurrence happened a few years after found himself in a dispute with his uncle, king D. John V of Portugal, that originated due to D. Pedro Henrique de Bragança’s romantic relationship with Luísa Clara de Portugal. The 1st Duke of Lafões directed the construction of Grilo Palace after Lisbon's massive earthquake on 1 November 1755. D. Pedro Henrique was first given the opportunity however due to his premature death in 1761, it was delegated to the Duke's younger brother: D. João Carlos de Bragança, Duke de Lafões. Architecture Plan of the project of Eugénio dos Santos - Palacio do Grilo Murals painting of Academia room by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado The construction structures that integrate the current architectonic complex of Grilo Palace are constituted by the sum of the interventions made throughout the years. The architecture is attributed to Eugénio dos Santos. The interior is synonymous of decorative programs around cultural diversity and erudition, there are sets of murals painting by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado and canvases from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they integrate theme lounges in the palace, such as the hall of the academy, the hall of Venus or the Chinese room. The structure was arranged in L shape, having its major compound oriented in the north–south direction, being thus vertical to Tejo River whilst the structure's minor compound was in turn facing towards the river, as well as the public avenue. In the interior part of the L structure, a patio used to exist, contained by other more modest constructions. The patio was located at the upper level of the street and could be accessed through a ramp that went under the shorter compound of the L shaped structure. The main part of the palace, the larger body of the L shaped compound is, to this day, sensible to the already existing complex formed by the western wing. The main section standing on the avenue was doubled forming a facade of 11 apertures divided in 2 levels: ground level and noble floor. Similarly, the patio at the superior level with fairly approximate dimensions was also kept in the reconstruction project, with only minor corrections being necessary in order to maintain symmetry. At the ground level, springing from the facade a great lounge was suggested, from which a simplified staircase would come to lead the way to a grand open ballroom, towering that same patio. On the east side another main section symmetrically disposed to the already existent one was proposed. Taking advantage of the slope in a masterly way, this new building provided access directly into the patio through a ramp today known as Duke of Lafões Sidewalk. To the north of the central patio, stood another new main section. In the back, the gardens displayed in cascate through the hill. At the same level and connected to this lounge, was displayed another partition of extensive spaciousness, presumably destined to become a library considering the delimited markings on the plant. In opposition to the tradition of other Lisbon palaces, the Palacio do Grilo project is composed of a scholarly complexity, characteristic of whom was used to maneuver architecture as a theoretical exercise of styling and to whom great palatian constructions would extend throughout Europe. Current status In 2011, it attained the status of Public Interest Monument (PIM). Buildings The access to the interior is done by the staircase of 18 stone stretches coated in glazed tiles of the late 18th century in blue and white representing mythological and gallant style (Diana and Actaeon); in the upper level section, 3 doors, with cocking-cloths in carmine velvet with coat of arms, topped with 19th century tiled panels in blue and white, trimmed with heraldic coats of arms of the Lafões, Cadaval, and Marialva Houses; * Dining Hall: primitive terracotta tiled floor; 17th century tiled skirting board; smooth walls and ceiling (after restoration); portraits of family personalities and 1 depicting Isabel de Farnese; * Lounge: restored in the mid-20th century, with fluted pilasters belonging to the Doric order embedded in the walls; the wall openings (vãos) lined in silk; a great vessel of Italian marble, on a niche at the top; D.

It is about east of Ottawa, straddling the boundary of Clarence-Rockland and The Nation municipality. The forest, part of the of forest in Ontario, is named after Ferdinand Larose, and is owned and managed by the county. Recreational activities in the multi-purpose forest include hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, hunting and trapping, animal watching, horseback, ATV and snowmobile riding. The forest is also used for small scale logging operations. The forest is the second largest man-made forest in southern Ontario and in 2011 was called an \\"unappreciated world leader as an example of environmental sustainability.\\" History All of Eastern Ontario was originally forested with large stands of maple, white cedar, white pine and tamarack, as well as red pine wherever the soil was sandy. Other than trapping for the fur trade, little to no human development occurred and the area remained untouched until the end of the 18th century. But as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, England needed new lumber sources for its navy and shipbuilding in 1805. This led to a rapid growth of the logging industry in the Ottawa River basin. By the mid 19th century, logging reached its peak and the best stands of old-growth pines were already cut. To keep the lumber mills in Lemieux, Fournier, Lalonde, Proulx, Riceville, and St. Isidore going, smaller trees were also harvested. Additionally, the remaining vegetation was burned to clear the land for agriculture. This left most of the county as a blow-sand desert. This complete disruption of the ecosystem caused serious problems. Rivers that previously flowed year-round became intermittent or dried up, fires would burn out of control, the sandy soil eroded, and certain animal and plant species completely disappeared while other species proliferated to the point of becoming pests. The area was then known as the Bourget Desert. To address the problems, a replanting project was initiated in the 1920s, spearheaded by Ferdinand Larose who was the agricultural representative for the Counties of Prescott and Russell. In 1928, Larose persuaded the Russell County Council to purchase from private landowners for reforestation in the Bourget Desert, and that same year, the first were planted in red pine, with Leo Lapalm of Bourget as planting foreman. While the county owned the land, management was the responsibility of Ontario Department of Lands and Forests (now Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry). Additional land was purchased at a rate of about per year between 1945 and 1956. Tree planting continued throughout the following decades, increasing to about 1 million trees planted annually in the 1940s and 1950s. Initially mostly red pine, white pine, and white spruce were planted, while later on poplar, birch, and other deciduous trees were added. By the 1970s, most of the land had been reforested and planting was reduced to about 200,000 trees per year. By 2016, more than 18 million trees had been planted and the first seedlings planted in 1928 had grown to about in height. In 2000, the management responsibility of the forest reverted to the County. In 1989, Larose Forest won the first “Ontario’s Forest of the Year” award, and in 2007, it was awarded FSC Certification. Climate Based on the nearest climate station in Russell, the mean annual temperature in Larose Forest is for the period 1981-2010, up from for the period 1971-2000. January is the coldest month of the year (with a daily average temperature of ) and July is the warmest month (daily average temperature of ). Annual rainfall is and snowfall is , for a total precipitation of . Snow cover at the end of January and February was respectively. Due to this climate, Larose Forest is in plant hardiness zone 5a. Ecology Larose Forest is a forested island in the mostly agricultural landscape of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands. It can be divided into three main ecozones: softwood plantings, red maple stands, and wetlands. These areas contain a large variety of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, fish, vascular plants and mushrooms. The most common animals include deer, beavers, moose, turtles, butterflies and birds of prey. Soils are mostly acidic fine sands of the well drained Uplands, imperfectly drained Rubicon, and poorly drained Saint-Samuel series, all of which have a classic podzol appearance in undisturbed areas. Flora Larose Forest, October 2019 As of April 2015, 673 different vascular plant species have been identified in Larose Forest, including 77 regionally significant species, 8 provincially vulnerable or endangered species, as well as 1 critically endangered species in Ontario (large purple-fringed orchid/Platanthera grandiflora). The following are the predominant tree species in Larose Forest: *Broadleaf (about 30% of forest stands): ** ash-leaved maple ** grey birch ** poplar ** silver maple *Coniferous (about 57% of forest stands): ** larch ** red pine ** white pine ** white spruce Fauna The number of mammal species found in Larose Forest is 29, including big game animals moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and American black bear (Ursus americana). Other species include coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), American mink (Mustela vison), raccoon (Procyon lotor), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis). The number of moose dropped considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. Whereas in 1994 the density of moose in Larose Forest was 7.0 moose per 10 km2, it had reduced to 2.2 per 10 km2 by 2007. In optimal conditions, Larose Forest should be able to sustain more than four times as many moose. As of September 2016, 144 bird species have been observed in Larose Forest, including 93 confirmed species that breed there. As of May 2015, 19 reptile and amphibian species have been observed, including: * blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale) * eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) * eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) * gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) * American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) * green frog (Lithobates clamitans) * northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) * wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) * common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) – designated a Species of Special Concern * Midland painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) – designated a Species of Special Concern * Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) – designated Endangered * eastern garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis) * red-bellied snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) Fungi As of September 2007, 506 fungus species have been found in Larose Forest. As of September 2016, 70 species of lichen have been identified, of which 2 are regionally or provincially rare or significant. Additionally, 11 liverwort and 55 moss species are known to be present, of which 6 species are vulnerable in Ontario.

The ideology of the corporation was inspired by the prevalence of U.S modernisation theories in the 1950s that believed in developing these rural areas in the hopes of obtaining political support in the war.  Formation  The Development and Resources Corporation was founded in 1955 in New York City by David E. Lilienthal and Gordon R. Clapp with support from investment banking firm Lazard Freres. It was proposed as a body of U.S \\"government development experience\\" alongside \\"private business and financial talents\\" that would focus not only on modernising material surroundings of under developed countries, but also changing the public outlook of these communities. This ideology built upon Lilienthal's role as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority where he developed hydroelectric power hubs in urban American areas. The corporation aimed to implement its projects directly and on a regional level. Throughout the 1960s, the Development and Resources Corporation obtained a worldwide reach, establishing projects in Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Haiti, Peru, Italy, Nigeria, Malaysia, Australia and other nations across the globe.  Projects   Columbia  In 1954, the Development and Resources Corporation begun its first project, along the Cauca River Valley in Colombia. Lilienthal worked in an advisory role to the Cauca Valley Corporation, instigating plans for improved flood control and hydroelectricity that centred on the creation of a hydroelectric project in Calima with the aim to modernise the region. However, in 1957, Colombia's military dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla withdrew his support of the Development and Resources Corporation, ending the development plan. In 1964, when the Cauca Valley Corporation was reinstated, it operated without the influence of Lilienthal's corporation.  Khuzestan  In March 1956, the Development an Resources Corporation begun their plans for the development of Khuzestan, following the failure of the Iranian Shah to modernise the region. Lilienthal's proposal - 'The Unified Development of the National Resources of the Khuzestan Region' - aimed to create a modernised system built on fourteen dams across the Dez River, including the Pahlavi Dam. The tallest of these dams would reach 620 feet above ground level and combined, the system would create an output of 6.5 kilowatts of hydroelectric power. The plan cost $160 million. The Development and Resources Corporation also assessed, alongside subcontractors, the feasibility of Iran's second Seven Year Plan in the oil rich region. In November 1960, the establishment of the Khuzestan Water and Power Authority (KWPA) presented a challenge for the Development and Resources Corporation. KWPA aimed to liquidate Lilienthal's corporation and gutted its plans for a rural health program and new fertiliser plants. This, alongside the declining state of the Iranian economy and the Shah's cutting of appropriations to focus on military spending, led to the slow decline of the Development and Resource Corporation's influence in Khuzestan until 1979.  Vietnam  In 1966, President Johnson enlisted Lilienthal to help establish a post war development system in Vietnam. Working within the Joint Development Group that consisted of both Americans and Vietnamese, the Development and Resources Corporation focused its efforts along the Mekong River Delta, introducing flood control measures, pest control and agricultural improvement strategies. However, the 1968 Tet Offensive and President Johnson's decision to not run for reelection, led to the withdrawal of Vietnamese cooperation and a decline of support for the Development and Resources Corporation. In April 1970, at the end of their initial three year contract, the Development and Resources Corporation left Vietnam.  United States of America  The Development and Resources Corporation also had a continued influence at home, in the U.S, during the Cold War. Lilienthal's involvement with President Kennedy's 'Peace Corps' program included the training of volunteers in agricultural skills at a centre in the Californian Imperial Valley. The Development and Resources Corporation also worked alongside President Johnson's idea of the 'Great Society', establishing engineering programs in the New Jersey Meadowlands and Ramparts River in Alaska with the direct aim to reduce poverty and provide work.  Dissolution  In 1969, the Development and Resources Corporation suffered its first loss in fifteen years, following their decline of influence in Iran. Throughout the 1970s, this decline continued as the corporation struggled financially with existing projects lost profits and there was a struggle in obtaining new contracts. This was seen in Brazil where Lilienthal's aim for a long term project in the Sao Francisco River Valley failed. Despite a slight resurgence of fortunes in Iran with a multi year national water plan established, the Khuzestan project ended in 1979 due to high competition with the Khuzestan Water and Power Agency and increasing political agitations in the region. Later that year, Lilienthal decided to dissolve the Development and Resource Corporation.

History In 1909, a strike occurred among scalemakers at Messrs Hodgson and Stead, in Manchester. Following the strike, many employees decided to found a union, the Amalgamated Society of Scale Beam and Weighing Machine Makers. Initially very small, the union expanded steadily, opening branches in Liverpool and Sheffield in 1910, and expanding into Wales in 1911, Scotland in 1912, and Ireland in 1918. That year, membership reached 600, and in 1920 it peaked at 1,000. Wage reductions in the industry and poor organisation led to financial difficulties, which culminated in 1923 with the London branch splitting away. The London branch claimed to represent the continuation of the union, and it was moderately successful, reaching 150 members by 1927. The remainder of the union struggled to survive, making its general and financial secretary post part-time, and renaming itself as the Society of Scale Beam and Weighing Machinists. It registered as a trade union in 1924 and affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), but declined to only 150 members. The TUC was concerned about the conflict between the two unions, and brokered a merger, which took place at the start of 1928, although the union still had a membership of only 282. A ballot saw the union's headquarters move to London, and membership began increasing rapidly. In 1939, it was able to make the general and financial secretary position full-time again, and by 1949 it had a membership of 2,500. In 1935, the union affiliated with the Scottish Trades Union Congress, with the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1945, and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1948. In 1938, it began describing itself as an industrial union, representing all workers connected with the scalemaking trade, and the first woman joined the union in 1941. The union repeatedly considered merging into the Amalgamated Engineering Union, but feared that its members interests would be neglected by the much larger union. In 1993, the union merged into Manufacturing, Science and Finance.John B.

The governor holds office at the Biliran Provincial Capitol located at Brgy. Calumpang, Naval, Biliran. Like all local government heads in the Philippines, the governor is elected via popular vote, and may not be elected for a fourth consecutive term (although the former governor may return to office after an interval of one term). In case of death, resignation or incapacity, the vice governor becomes the governor. The current governor is Rogelio J. Espina who was elected during the last May 13, 2019 local elections. He previously served as governor for 3 consecutive terms from 2001 to 2010.  History  On April 15, 1959, President Carlos P. Garcia appointed Caibiran Mayor Uldarico R. Reyes as its first lieutenant governor of Biliran which was made as a sub-province of Leyte after the enactment of Republic Act No. 2141. Reyes assumed the position on October 25, 1959. Thereafter, the position was generally elected. Subsequently, the title of lieutenant governor was changed into a governor on June 21, 1969 pursuant to Republic Act No. 5977 thereby giving the office holder the executive powers of a provincial governor.

After World War II in France, she became secretary of the French Committee for Exchange with the New Germany and was instrumental in building political and cultural Franco-German relations.  Life  Lily Emilie Rosenthal, daughter of Alfred Rosenthal, was born into a Jewish middle- class household in Frankfurt. Until she was 18, she was allowed to leave the house on Mendelssohn Street in Frankfurt's Westend only in the company of a governess. Like many young women at the time, she supported the German soldiers during World War I from her homeland through active relief measures, and for this she received the German Cross of Merit for War Aid. The conflict was hard on her family; her fiancé Max Koch from Kronberg im Taunus died in 1918 and her father Alfred died in 1919. On 16 March 1921 she married the Jewish university professor and pediatrician Paul Grosser in Frankfurt. (Paul had earned a post doctoral degree, called habilitation, in 1919 as the first pediatrician at Frankfurt University.) During World War I, Paul had served his country as a medical officer at the front. From 1921 to 1929, Paul served as chief physician of the Municipal Children's Home with children's clinic in Frankfurt's Jewish-influenced district of Westend. The Grosser's daughter Margaret was born 13 April 1922 and son Alfred followed on 1 February 1925. In April 1933, as part of Nazi repressive measures against Jews, Paul Grosser was removed as department chair and, that summer, was dismissed although he was recognized as the \\"extremely successful medical director\\" of the Clementine Children's Hospital. The family then traveled to neighboring France to explore residency there and ultimately decided to move. On December 16, 1933, the family emigrated from Frankfurt am Main to Saint-Germain-en-Laye northwest of Paris by rail via Switzerland. However Paul Grosser died of a heart attack on February 7, 1934 at the age of 54. With his death, Lily had to abandon Paul's plans to build a children’s sanatorium on the outskirts of the French capital. Instead, Lily established a children's home on the property Paul had purchased but without the planned medical facilities. On 1 October 1937 Lily Grosser and her children were given French citizenship through a decree by the Minister of Justice (and later President), Vincent Auriol; as a result, they were spared possible internment in a French camp. The Grosser family about 1929/1930 in Frankfurt, Germany. Beginning in 1940, the family endured a series of escapes and separations. * On 10 June 1940, after the German troops invaded Paris, Lily Grosser's children Margarethe and Alfred fled alone to the unoccupied part of France. Her son Alfred recalled that the two siblings bicycled their way to freedom. Lily remained with her mother who died after a long illness on 29 July 1940 at the age of 81. * In September 1940, Lily Grosser followed her children to Saint-Raphaël in southwestern France, but in 1941 daughter Margarethe died from a blood infection that resulted from an injury during the bicycle escape. * In 1943, when German soldiers arrived to replace the occupying Italian Axis forces, Lily Grosser and son Alfred fled again but became separated from each other. * In the autumn of 1944, Lily and her son Alfred met again in Marseilles, France. There she became deputy head of a military hospital run by the French Red Cross. After the end of World War II, from 1948 to 1967, despite and because of these experiences, Lily Grosser and her son joined the Comité français d'échanges avec l 'Allemagne nouvelle (French Committee for Exchange with the New Germany) and worked to establish a lively exchange and reconciliation between the French and Germans, ultimately hoping to strengthen democratic structures in Germany. She was remembered as \\"the soul of the committee.\\" In 1962 she received the Cross of Merit on the Ribbon of the Order of Merit from Germany for her tireless dedication toward improved relations between the two countries. Lily Grosser died 20 September 1968 in Paris after a serious illness.  Honors  * As a young woman, on August 24, 1918, Lily Emilie Rosenthal received the German Cross of Merit for War Aid, which was awarded to all men and women who had excelled in domestic service during World War I. * On 23 January 1962, Lily Grosser was awarded the Cross of Merit on the Ribbon of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for special achievements in the political, economic, cultural, spiritual or voluntary fields after the end of World War II.

He showed good early form, winning once as a juvenile and taking the Spring Stakes and Fukushima Kinen in the following year. As a four-year-old he added a win over a strong field in the Nakayama Kinen but the rest of his form was unremarkable. He reached his peak as a five-year-old in 2019 when he won the Nakayama Kimpai and a second Nakayama Kinen before capturing the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse. In December he returned to Hong Kong and recorded a second major victory as he won the Hong Kong Cup. Background Win Bright is a grey horse bred in Japan by Cosmo View Farm. During his racing career he was trained by Yoshihiro Hatakeyama and raced in the black, white and red colours of Win Co Ltd. He had a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs but these markings became less visible as his coat lightened. Win Bright was ridden in most of his races by Masami Matsuoka. He was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Stay Gold a horse whose wins included the Dubai Sheema Classic and Hong Kong Vase in 2001. He went on to sire many major winners including Orfevre, Gold Ship, Nakayama Festa, Rainbow Line and Fenomeno. Win Bright's dam Summer Eternity, from whom he inherited his colour, won three minor races in four seasons on the track between 2007 and 2010 Her grand-dam Miss Guelain was a half-sister to the dam of the Yushun Himba winner Cosmo Dream. Racing career 2016: two-year-old season Win Bright began his racing career by finishing sixth in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 26 June and then ran fifth in a maiden race over the same distance at Fukushima Racecourse four weeks later. At Tokyo on 12 November the colt recorded his first success when he won a maiden from Meiner Raptis and eleven others. On his final run of the year he finished second to Outliers in a minor race over 1600 metres at Nakayama Racecourse in December. 2017: three-year-old season Win Bright's regular jockey Masami Matsuoka On his three-year-old debut Win Bright won the Wakatake Sho over 1800 metres at Nakayama on 21 January. He was then stepped up in class for the Spring Stakes (a major trial race for the Grade 2 Satsuki Sho) over the same course and distance on 19 March and started the 8.1/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Satono Ares (winner of the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes), Outliers, Tricolore Bleu and Monde Can Know. After being settled towards the rear by Matsuoka he was switched to the outside in the straight and produced a sustained run to take the lead in last 100 metres and win by half a length from Outliers. In the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at the same track he started slowly, and never looked likely to win despite making late progress on the outside, coming home eighth of the eighteen runners behind Al Ain. Win Bright was then stepped up in distance to contest the 2400 Tokyo Yushun on 28 May, in which he started a 133/1 outsider and finished towards the rear behind Rey de Oro after fading in the closing stages. After a break of over four months Win Bright was matched against older horses in the Grade 2 Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo and finished tenth of the twelve runners behind Real Steel. On his final run of the year the colt started the 4.4/1 second favourite for the Group 3 Fukushima Kinen on 12 November. After racing in third place for most of the way, Win Bright went to the front early in the straight and held on to win by a neck from the six-year-old Suzuka Devious in a tight finish. 2018: four-year-old season Win Bright's third campaign began at Nakayama on 6 January 2018 when he was beaten a neck into second place by the favoured Seda Brillantes in the Grade 3 Nakayama Kimpai. At the same track on 25 February he contested the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen and started at 4.3/1 in a ten-runner field which also included the Grade 1 winners Persian Knight (Mile Championship), Aerolithe (NHK Mile Cup) and Vivlos. After racing in mid- division, Win Bright made a forward move approaching the final turn, overtook the front-running Maltese Apogee in the straight, and held off the late challenge of Aerolithe to win by a neck. Win Bright was then moved up to Grade 1 class for the Osaka Hai at Hanshin Racecourse on 1 April but never looked likely to win and finished unplaced behind Suave Richard. He returned to the track in autumn but failed to reproduce his best form in two races, finishing tenth to Logi Cry in the Fuji Stakes at Tokyo in October, and ninth to Stelvio in the Mile Championship at Kyoto Racecourse in November. 2019: five-year- old season Sha Tin Racecourse, where Win Bright recorded his two biggest victories in 2019 As in the previous year, Win Bright began his season in the Nakayama Kimpai and went one better than in 2018 as came with a strong late run on the outside to take the lead inside the last 100 metres and won by half a length from Stay Foolish at odds of 7.4/1. In the following month he started at odds of 6/1 as he attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the Nakayama Kinen, facing ten rivals including Deirdre, Lucky Lilac, Epoca d'Oro, Stelvio and Suave Richard. After racing in fourth place for most of the way Win Bright stayed on strongly in the straight and won by a neck and a head from Lucky Lilac and Stelvio. For his next start Win Bright joined Lys Gracieux and Deirdre in a three-horse Japanese challenge for the Grade 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup over 2000 metres at Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong and started a 47/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. The home contingent included Exultant (Hong Kong Vase), Glorious Forever (2018 Hong Kong Cup), Pakistan Star (winner of the race in 2018) and Time Warp (2017 Hong Kong Cup). After starting slowly Win Bright settled in mid-division on the inside as Time Warp set the pace from Glorious Forever, before making a forward move on the final turn. He briefly struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but overtook Pakistan Star 100 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from Exultant and Lys Gracieux. Matsuoka, who was recording his first Grade 1 win in ten years, commented \\"We didn't get off to a good start but we still managed to travel in the position we wanted to and everything worked out in the end. It turned out to be a fabulous day.\\" When Win Bright returned to the track in autumn he ran disappointingly in the Sankei Sho All Comers at Nakayama in September and then finished unplaced when starting a 148/1 outsider for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho at Tokyo a month later. On 8 December the horse returned to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and started the 4.4/1 third choice in the betting behind the locally trained duo Furore (Hong Kong Derby) and Rise High (Sha Tin Trophy). The other five runners Magic Wand from Ireland (Mackinnon Stakes), Edisa from France, Glorious Forever, Time Warp and Dark Dream. Win Bright settled behind the leaders took the lead 150 metres from the finish and held off the late challenge of Magic Wand to win by a nose. After the race Matsuoka said \\"It was very, very good because his last two starts were not first-three performances but the horse's condition has been going up since he got here so were very happy. We had a very good day here in April so it was very memorable to come here. Sha Tin suits the horse very well because he likes the right-handed course in Japan, so it is very suitable\\". In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Win Bright was voted Best Older Male Horse, beating Indy Champ by 136 votes to 118.

He played one of two sadistic mountain men in John Boorman's 1972 film Deliverance (with Bill McKinney), and several of his lines became infamous in pop culture. Early life Coward was born in 1938 in Haywood County, North Carolina, the ninth child of Fred and Moody Parker Coward. His mother died at a young age, so he left school and began working a variety of itinerant labor jobs to help support the family, including at an orchard and operating heavy machinery. After getting married in the early 1960s and briefly living in Raleigh, he moved back to the mountains with his wife when she became homesick. Career After returning home, a friend offered Coward a job as an outlaw gunfighter at an Old West ghost town amusement park in Maggie Valley. While performing at the park with an assortment of acting school students working over their summer break, locals, and professional actors, an accident with a prop pistol resulted in two of his front teeth being knocked out. Known actors, including Dan Blocker who starred on Bonanza, performed at the park, and one summer, based on his appearances on Gunsmoke, Burt Reynolds appeared there. During this time, Reynolds and Coward became friends. In 1970, when Deliverance began filming in Rabun County, Georgia, Blocker mentioned to producers that Coward would be an ideal person for a role in the film; they were unable to locate him, so wrote his name on a potential cast board as \\"Cowboy Coward\\". Reynolds saw this and called Coward to recruit him for the role, telling the producers \\"...he can’t write or anything, but I’m telling ya, if we can get him, we got something special. Let me bring him in. His name’s Cowboy, and he’ll just talk to you, and you see if you like him.\\" Coward was subsequently cast as \\"Toothless Man\\", one of the two sadistic mountain men encountered in the woods by Reynolds and the film's other protagonists. Like the others in the film, Coward performed his own stunts, including being lowered off a cliff into a river. Upon the film's release he became infamous for his often repeated line \\"He’s got a real pretty mouth, ain’t he?\\" After appearing in the film, Coward worked at the BASF factory in Asheville for 27 years. He also appeared in one other film, Ghost Town: The Movie (2007), and on television's Hillbilly Blood in 2013. Legacy Coward's performance and physical appearance in Deliverance has provided inspiration for other media, most notably the main character from Primus video My Name Is Mud, which also sampled lines from the film.

Leadbeater was a research fellow at the Institute of Zoology and then a lecturer at Royal Holloway, University of London where in 2019 she was appointed Professor of Ecology and Evolution.  Research  Her research looks at insect cognition and how this is affected by the animals' environment. She has looked at how bumblebees can learn where to find nectar, by watching other bees within an arena choose a particular flower colour that bears nectar, and then choosing the same colour flower when they enter the arena. Leadbeater's team have studied the honey bee waggle dance, looking at the specific genes in the bee brain that are switched on following the dance, to see how changes in the environment affects the bee foraging and communication to others. Her work has also looked at the effect of insecticide toxicity on bees and she supported the 2013 EU moratorium and later ban on neconicotinoid insecticides. Her work has shown that chemical insecticides can affect bee learning and memory, such as remembering which flowers near a colony have nectar or have been emptied. She has advised caution on new insecticide products such as Sulfoxaflor and her team found that the compound affected bumblebee colony reproduction, with colonies exposed to the compound not producing new queens and subsequent work showed that exposed colonies laid fewer eggs with fewer bumblebee larvae hatching.

The album went through a lengthy production process as a result of health complications frontman Steve Austin faced, and was released five years after the band's 2014 album Animal Mother, marking the longest gap between albums for the band. Jef Whitehead of black metal band Leviathan painted the cover artwork for the album. The album was promoted with three digital-only singles: \\"No Good to Anyone\\", \\"You're All Gonna Die\\", and \\"Burn in Hell\\", the third of which had a music video produced for it. Background Production for the album begun in 2016, and shortly thereafter the band signed to The End Records for its release as well as the reissue of the band's back catalogue. Many of the album's lyrics were inspired by health problems Austin faced before and during production of the album: both he and his pet dog Callie contracted Lyme disease, and as a result Callie had to be euthanized. The track \\"Callie\\" was written to commemorate her. Before that, Austin had been involved in an accident in late 2014 during the band's tour in promotion of Animal Mother, in which the band's van collided with another vehicle, resulting in Austin breaking his ribs. The track \\"Orland\\" was performed by Austin's son, Will Austin, who also played piano on \\"Rockets and Dreams\\". Reception Writing for Kerrang!, Angela Davey wrote positively about the album stating that it's \\"a disconcerting listening experience\\" and \\"one hell of a trip\\", ultimately awarding the album four out of five stars.

Carrots are the only known crop to be infected in the field. Infection by the virus leads to deformed roots and discolored or mottled leaves. The virus is spread through insect vectors, and is currently only found in Australia.  Symptoms  The carrot, a root vegetable, is the main host of Carrot virus Y  Foliage  The symptoms of CarVY in carrot foliage may include chlorotic mottle (irregular small yellow patches), marginal leaflet necrosis or reddening, generalised chlorosis of leaves, and plant stunting. Necrosis occurs when a living organism's cells or tissues die or degenerate. Plant necrosis causes leaves, stems and other parts of the plant to darken and wilt. This is a result of the virus using the plant as a host, as the plant's energy is diverted to the virus rather than to the plant's growth. Over time, this energy depletion leads to necrosis in the infected area where the virus is replicating itself. In plant chlorosis, tissues that are normally green become pale, yellow, or bleached. This results from chlorophyll failing to develop due to the infection of the virus. Additionally, the infected plant can portray a ‘feathery’ appearance due to an increase in the subdivisions of the carrot leaflets. Leaf symptoms and plant stunting symptoms differ greatly between different carrot varieties. Some plants will develop obvious symptoms that can be easily seen from a distance. However, others can express symptoms that are so mild that they are difficult to see even upon close inspection of affected plants. In actively growing carrot crops, foliage symptoms of CarVY are easily confused with the symptoms of nutritional deficiencies. Additionally, growers routinely stop adding fertilizers at the end of each growing season to reduce post-harvest carrot disorders. This results in leaf yellowing symptoms, which can be confused with the symptoms that resemble those caused by CarVY.  Roots  The roots of carrot plants also become severely deformed as a result of CarVY infection. When carrot plants become infected with CarVY at an early stage in the growth cycle, they portray stubby roots with severe distortion and knobliness (the ‘Michelin carrot’ syndrome). Carrots that are infected later in the life cycle are thinner and longer than carrots infected earlier. Furthermore, in plants infected early, the tops of the roots tend to emerge from the soil and become exposed to the sun. This results in the ‘shoulders’ of the carrots turning a green color. Early infected plants also have severe distortion of the internal vascular cambium. Instead of its normal circular shape, carrots exhibit a star-like vascular cambium consisting of multiple contortions. Entire fields have been abandoned due to crop infection. The severe root defomalities associated with early virus infection make the carrots unmarketable. Carrots infected later in the growth cycle do not display such dramatic deformations, but are still considered less-desirable and are sold and a significantly lower price.  Structure  CarVY belongs to the Potyviridae family of viruses. Potyviruses are non-enveloped viruses that are symmetrically helical. These filamentous viruses are typically 720-850 nm long and 12-15 nm in diameter. Their flexuous virions can be easily identified in infected carrot leaf samples using electron microscopy.  Genome  The non-segmented, linear genome of CarVY is 1,754 kb. CarVY is typically 11 nm wide and 770 nm long.  Vectors   Aphids  Myzus persicae, the green peach aphid, is an effective transmitter of Carrot virus Y CarVY is transmitted between plants by aphids, including those that do not normally colonize carrots. Aphids are soft-bodied insects that feed on plant sap. Their sucking mouthparts allow for viruses to be transmitted between plants. With their ability to reproduce asexually, they are able to multiply and colonize very quickly. This allows them to spread a virus very quickly. Myzus persicae (M. personae), a small green aphid most commonly known as the green peach aphid, is the most efficient transmitter of the virus. By feeding on the sap of the carrot plant, aphids injest the virus of the host, which they can later transmit to other uninfected plants that they will feed on. Other colonizing species, such as Aphis spiraecola (green citrus aphid) and D. apiifolia (hawthorn parsley aphid), can also be successful virus vectors. Non-colonizing species such as Lipahis erysimi (turnip aphid) and Acyrthosiphon kondoi (bluegreen aphid), may also serve as efficient transmitters.  Seeds  It is unknown if infected seeds can transmit the virus to other seeds. If CarVY is confirmed to be transmissible in future research, it is expected that it will only be at low levels, as Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), a potyvirus, is only transmissible at very low levels. LMV is a potyvirus that affects vegetable crops. If seed transmission is confirmed, seed stock will need to be routinely tested before sowing.  Transmission  If an aphid is able to successfully take up a virion, and the virion remains stable, the virus can be transmitted to a new host. In relation to the aphid, potyviruses are noncirculative viruses. Noncirculative viruses are associated with the mouthparts and foregut, giving them a more superficial and transient relationship with the vector. CarVY does not appear to harm its aphid vector. Virus transmission consists of at least three steps:  Acquisition  The first step in viral transmission is acquisition, which consists of the uptake of the virus from an infected source. Aphids are well designed for their roles as vectors. Their mouthparts consist of a needle-like stylet that is capable of piercing plant cells walls in order to feed on the plant’s sugary sap. Aphids can facilitate the uptake and delivery of virions into plant cells without causing too much irreversible damage to the host.  Stabilization  The purpose of the second step of transmission is the stable retention of acquired virions in the vector at specific sites. A virus destined for inoculation is retained at sites within the stylet and food canal, or in the foregut. Potyvirus virions cannot be transmitted alone. Rather, they associate with a second viral-encoded accessory protein, termed “helper component” (HC). The virion and the HC associate with the cuticular lining of the aphid food canal. The “bridge hypothesis” helps explain how the HC functions as a bridge that attaches virions to the food canal of the aphid vector. The HC is a multifunctional protein, and mutations in the domains that make up the HC protein can affect transmission.  Inoculation  The final step in transmission is inoculation. Inoculation consists of the release of bound or retained virions and their delivery to a site of infection. The needle-like stylet delivers virions to the new host plant. Salivation may be important in enhancing the release of bound virions and their delivery into plant cells.  Replication cycle  The replication cycle of CarVY have not been explicitly studied, but it can be assumed that the virus follows the (+)ss-RNA infectious cycle of the potyvirus. As other (+)RNA plant viruses do, potyviruses utilize the protein synthesis machinery of the host in the production of viral proteins. They also make use of the endomembrane and cellular secretion systems in the formation of viral replication complexes (VRCs), and use the cell connecting plasmodesmata (PD) to spread their viral genome to other cells in the host. A potyvirus penetrates into a cell of the host, thereby infecting it. The virus is uncoated, a process in which the helical viral proteins are removed. This exposes the viral genomic RNA to the cytoplasm. The RNA is then translated to produce a polyprotein, which is then processed by viral proteases into RNA dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins. These are both used to replicate the viral genome, which takes place in cytoplasmic viral factories. Using the (+)ssRNA genome originally used to infect the host, a dsRNA genome is synthesized. This new genome is then transcribed and replicated, producing viral mRNAs and new (+)ssRNA genomes. Virions are then assembled in the cytoplasm, and the virus is ready to be transferred to new cells. It is assumed that the viral movement protein P3N-PIPO mediates cell-to-cell transfer of the virions. This allows the virus to further infect the host.  Incidence  A field of carrot crops. CarVY has currently only been detected in Australia. It has been found in carrot crops in the states of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The incidence of CarVY is high on farms that have continuous carrot production. The incidence is found to be lower when farms rotate carrot crops with non-host crops or fallow. In a 2000-2002 study, CarVY was found to be infecting carrot crops in all six Australian states. The virus infected 30 out of 36 tested carrot cultivars. The incidence was greater in states (New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia) where carrot production was continuous. Additionally, the virus is able to successfully infect and multiply when carrots are grown for seed production (in which the carrots are grown continuously for approximately two years). In states where carrot growing is restricted to the summer or winter months, the incidence of CarVY was greatly reduced. Incidence is much lower when crops are only grown for six months out of the year. The study illustrates that virus carryover can be greatly diminished when there is a break in carrot production.  Control  When it comes to the control of CarVY, the key measures include avoiding spread from nearby infected carrot crops, minimizing spread from volunteer carrots, and introducing non-host rotational crops. One of the easiest control methods is done by planting crops that are not in close proximity to each other. This avoids spread from potentially infected carrot crops. Additionally, the spread from volunteer carrot crops can be eliminated by spraying volunteer crops with herbicide, or deep ploughing before re-sowing the land with carrots. This removes potential virus infection sources and prevents them from spreading to new plantings. Another control method consists of manipulating the planting date of carrot crops in order to avoid exposure to peak aphid populations. When plants are at their most vulnerable growth stage, the symptoms of the virus become more severe as the crops develop. Avoiding peak aphid populations reduces the chance of infection at early growth stages, as plants infected later produce less damaged carrots.  Associated viruses  CarVY is most closely related to Celery mosaic virus.

It is native to the Northern Territory where it is common in the Top End. Description A. latescens is a tree growing from 4 to 9 m high. Its bark is brown and fissured. The smooth branchlets are ribbed, and its stipules fall. The pulvinus is 3-5 mm long and smooth. The smooth phyllodes are curved, and are 80-260 mm long by 4-18 mm wide. They have two primary veins (sometimes 1 or 3) and the secondary may be oblique, veined like a feather or forming a network. The base of the phyllode narrows gradually but the apex is acute. There are three glands along the dorsal margin and at the pulvinus. The axilliary inflorescences are racemes or panicles, with 4-11 heads per raceme. The white/cream heads are globular, and 4-6 mm wide on smooth peduncles which are 5-16 mm long. The greyish pods (50-210 mm long by 11-20 mm wide) are straight, and raised over the seeds with a slightly thickened margin. The dark brown to black seeds (9-10 mm long by 5-7 mm wide) are oblique in the pod. It flowers from April to July and fruits from August to January. Distribution It is found in the following bioregions of the Northern Territory: Arnhem Coast, Arnhem Plateau, Central Arnhem, Daly Basin, Darwin Coastal, Gulf Fall and Uplands, Pine Creek, Sturt Plateau, Tiwi Cobourg, and Victoria Bonaparte. Habitat It grows in eucalypt woodland. Taxonomy It was first described by George Bentham in 1842, from a specimen collected by Allan Cunningham on May-Day Island in van Diemen's Gulf, in 1818 on the first voyage of the Mermaid (Isolectotype BM000796904).

Burgie Castle is a 17th-century Z-plan tower house, about east of Forres, Moray, Scotland, south east of Burgie House.Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland. Goblinshead. p.95 History The land was transferred from Kinloss Abbey to the Dunbars in 1566, and they constructed the castle. Although in 1645 Dunbar of Burgie was in arms against James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, in 1650 he bankrupted himself in paying for supplies for the army of Charles II. Thomas Dunbar of Grange purchased the property from him. In 1702 the castle was extended, but in 1802 most of it was demolished to furnish material for Burgie House, which was in due course rebuilt as a plain two storey mansion in 1902. Structure Only the north west tower, of six storeys, remains from the original castle and a little of the main block. The tower is topped by a parapet. A corbelled-out stair tower, with a caphouse, stands in the re-entrant angle with the main block. There are iron yett bars in some windows, while the main entrance has its iron yet still. The walls are pierced by shot-holes and embrasures. The basement, and the fifth and sixth stories, are vaulted. In the remains of the main block is a fireplace surmounted by the Dunbar arms and the date 1602. Internally there are extensive areas of plasterwork, along with timberwork such as floors, cornices, doors and a shuttered window. A pleasance wall surrounds the structure. There is a well in what was once the courtyard. Preservation is being considered by the Burgie Castle Preservation Trust.

The series consists of 52 episodes. Jane Wallbank is the series producer, and Simon Harper is the executive producer. The series features an episode dedicated to Holocaust Memorial Day, a topical last-minute insert about the COVID-19 pandemic and a COVID-19-themed episode. Production for the drama was suspended between March and July 2020 due to the pandemic, which led to two transmission hiatuses during the series. Fifteen regular cast members reprised their roles from the previous series and three actors depart during the series. Guy Self (John Michie) returns for a short stint and Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) appears in a single episode, having been previously killed-off. The series also features the introduction of the show's first regular transgender character, Louis McGerry (Tyler Luke Cunningham), and a guest appearance for actor and television personality John Barrowman as Drew Nicholson-Heath. Episodes  Production  The series commenced on 7 January 2020 on BBC One and normally airs on Tuesday nights, although episode 9 was originally broadcast on a Wednesday evening. Episode 11 was postponed by a week due to an extended news bulletin on the COVID-19 outbreak. Simon Harper continues his role as the executive producer of the show, and Jane Wallbank serves as the series producer for the series. The series consists of 52 episodes. A winter trailer for the show's upcoming storylines was released on 4 December 2019. This series includes an episode dedicated to Holocaust Memorial Day featuring the characters of Sacha and Essie. Producers were asked by the BBC to create an episode for the occasion and they scripted it in August. The episode was broadcast as the fourth episode in the series. Holby City producers created two topical inserts for episodes 10 and 11 in March 2020, referencing the COVID-19 outbreak. A show spokesperson confirmed that the scenes were specially filmed a week prior to broadcast rather than the typical filming schedule months in advance. The drama's upcoming storylines were previewed in a trailer released on 6 March 2020. Stories include cancer diagnoses for Essie and Fletch. Harper praised the \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"wonderful\\" performances of Wragg and Walkinshaw, and explained that the story would follow the pair \\"[having] this huge, bonding thing in common but such a different experience of it.\\" Wragg also commented on the plot, \\"Throughout their journeys, Essie and Fletch discover their worst fears, their lost opportunities and what futures they need to make plans for.\\" It was announced on 18 March 2020 that production had been suspended on Holby City and other BBC Studios continuing dramas in light of new government guidelines following the COVID-19 pandemic. A BBC Studios statement confirmed that there would be no impact on the immediate broadcast of episodes, but the \\"long-term ramifications are still unclear\\". Despite this, it was announced on 9 April 2020 that the drama would be going on an extended hiatus on 14 April, following the broadcast of episode 14. Following its broadcast, it was confirmed that the show would return in July 2020. However, on 19 May 2020, it was announced that Holby City would return to broadcast on 2 June 2020. To aid hospitals during the outbreak, Holby City donated their on-set ventilators, which are fully operational, to the NHS Nightingale Hospital. On the donation, Harper commented, \\"We are only too happy to help out and do what we can for the courageous and selfless real life medics.\\" They also donated personal protective equipment and other hospital equipment to the NHS. Production resumed on Holby City in July 2020 with strict protocols enforced to maintain the safety of the cast and crew. Additionally, the social distancing measures enforced by the British government were adhered to. Filming for the series recommenced on 27 July and episodes were temporarily reduced to 40 minutes in length. Producers made the pandemic a recurring theme throughout the rest of the series, beginning with a special episode focusing on how the hospital staff, led by Max, deal with the pandemic. Kate Oates, the head of continuing drama at BBC Studios, expressed her delight at welcoming back the \\"exceptional cast and crew\\". She added, \\"We have some gripping stories to tell as we explore how the lives of our characters have been irrevocably changed since the start of the pandemic - and how our heroes battle against the odds, come what may.\\" A second extended hiatus for Holby City was announced in August 2020 due to the show running out of episodes filmed before the suspension of production. The show breaks on 11 August, following the broadcast of episode 25, and will return later in the year.  Cast  The series began with 15 roles receiving star billing. Jo Martin portrays Max McGerry, a consultant in neurosurgery and the acting chief executive officer of Holby City Hospital, the show's setting. Hugh Quarshie stars as Ric Griffin, the hospital's medical director and a consultant general surgeon on the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). Alex Walkinshaw stars as Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher, the director of nursing services. Catherine Russell plays Serena Campbell, the clinical lead of the AAU and a consultant general surgeon. Marcus Griffiths acts as Xavier \\"Zav\\" Duval, a general surgical registrar on the unit, and Nic Jackman features as Cameron Dunn, a general surgical CT1 doctor. Jaye Jacobs appears as Donna Jackson, the unit's senior staff nurse. Bob Barrett continues his role as Sacha Levy, a consultant general surgeon and the clinical lead of the general surgery ward, Keller. David Ames portrays Dominic Copeland, Keller ward's general surgical registrar. Kaye Wragg plays staff nurse Essie Di Lucca on the ward. Dawn Steele features as Ange Godard, a consultant general surgeon and the clinical lead of the Young Adult Unit (YAU), who later becomes the clinical lead of the AAU.

Rosie Marcel features in the series as Jac Naylor, a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon, and later, the co-clinical lead of the ward. Amy Lennox stars as Chloe Godard, a cardiothoracic registrar. Belinda Owusu portrays Nicky McKendrick, a cardiothoracic CT1 doctor. Additionally, the semi-regular cast contains Jules Robertson, Darcey Burke, Julia Deakin and Charlie Condou who star as porter Jason Haynes, Jac's daughter Emma Naylor-Maconie, Dominic's adoptive mother Carole Copeland, and locum consultant general surgeon Ben Sherwood, respectively. Russell's departure from the drama after seven years was confirmed on 30 October 2019, and Serena's exit airs at the beginning of the series. Harper expressed his sadness at the departure, but wished the actress the best for the future and thanked her for her \\"unique, drily witty and passionate\\" performance as Serena. The character departs in episode 3. Condou's guest stint as Ben ends in episode 11 at the conclusion of his coming out story. Condou explained that Ben leaves after deciding to \\"spend a bit of time trying to figure out who he is.\\" Writers opted to kill-off Zav in episode 14 as part of a story creating Cameron as a villainous character. Griffiths was pleased with his \\"memorable\\" exit story and thought it formed a \\"wicked, really awesome arc\\" to his character. Wragg's departure was confirmed in July 2020, and the character is killed-off in episode 25. In the narrative, Essie dies on her way to her wedding to Sacha. Guy Henry returns to his role as Henrik Hanssen, a consultant general surgeon, during this series, having taken a break in the previous series. Henry confirmed that he had returned for a longer stint and Hanssen returns in the seventh episode as part of a story involving Carole. The return of actor John Michie in the role of consultant neurosurgeon Guy Self was announced on 6 March 2020. Guy returns following the privatisation of Darwin ward by external company Kestrel, which Guy has shares in. Harper expressed his delight at the character's return, promising that he would \\"sow trouble and strife\\" and create tension with Ric. The character returns in episode 13. On 9 July 2020, it was announced that Joe McFadden had reprised his role as Raf di Lucca for a single episode. The character was killed-off in a nineteenth series episode and appears as a vision to Essie during her terminal cancer story. McFadden explained that Raf returns to guide Essie in a \\"touching\\" episode. A show spokesperon told the Daily Mirror that the appearance would be \\"emotional\\" and \\"incredibly moving\\". Tyler Luke Cunningham joined the cast as Louis McGerry, the son of Max, in episode 12. Louis, like Cunningham, is transgender and his introduction coincided with Trans Day of Visibility. Initially appearing in a recurring role, Cunningham joined the show's regular cast in episode 15 as Louis begins employment at the hospital as a staff nurse. The series features several recurring characters, and numerous guest stars. Wallbank confirmed in an August 2019 interview that two cast members from Holby City sister show Casualty: Jason Durr (David Hide) and Shaheen Jafargholi (Marty Kirkby) would appear during this series for guest appearances. Marty appears in a story with his cousin, Kian, and David appears in a story about nursing. Jafargholi's appearance features in episode two. Durr filmed his appearances in December 2019, and he appears in episodes 12 and 13. Nicky features prominently in the series as part of a \\"big, gritty, topical\\" story exploring her personal struggles. As part of the story, actress Cathy Murphy was cast to portray Nicky's mother, Tracey McKendrick, in a recurring capacity from episode 3. She continues to appear in the series until episode 21 when Nicky disowns her. Tracey's blackmailer, Steve Connor (John Wark), was also introduced for the beginning of the story, appearing in two episodes. Towards the end of Murphy's guest stint, Lynn Hunter was cast to portray Tracey's friend, Brenda Connolly. She appears in three episodes culminating in her character's death. Susan Engel reprised her guest role as Sacha's great aunt, Maria Edelman, in episode 4, having last appeared in series 19. She appears in the Holocaust Memorial Day episode. Following this, David Horovitch reprised his role as Rabbi Stein, the rabbi at Sacha's synagogue, having also previously appeared in a series 19 episode. Horovitch appeared again in the twenty-fifth episode for Sacha and Essie's wedding. As part of a story about Kian, Phoenix Bates (Joshua Glenister), the son of Kian's dead girlfriend, Bea Kaminski (Rosalind Halstead), was introduced. He appears in episodes 17 and 22. Episode 18 features the appearance of Fletch's daughter, Evie Fletcher, who is now portrayed by Phoebe French. Macey Chipping previously played the character across four series.

PIMs contain a continuous network of interconnected intermolecular voids less than 2 nm in width. Classified as a porous organic polymer, PIMs generate porosity from their rigid and contorted macromolecular chains that do not efficiently pack in the solid state. PIMs are composed of a fused ring sequences interrupted by Spiro-centers or other sites of contortion along the backbone. Due to their fused ring structure PIMs cannot rotate freely along the polymer backbone, ensuring the macromolecular components conformation cannot rearrange and ensuring the highly contorted shape is fixed during synthesis. Synthesis PIMs require that the non-network macromolecular structure is rigid and non-linear. In order to maintain permanent microporosity the rotation along the polymer chain must be prohibited through the use of fused ring structure or strongly hindered by steric inhibition to avoid conformation changes that would allow the polymer to pack efficiently. This results in the use of a conformationally locked monomer and a polymerization reaction that provides a linkage about which rotation is prohibited. Three main types of polymerization reactions have been successfully used to prepare PIMs of sufficient mass to form self-standing films. These involve a polymerization reaction based on a double aromatic nucleophilic substitution mechanism to form the dibenzodioxin linkage, a polymerization using Troger's base formation, and amide linkages formation between monomeric units. It is also possible to modify the structure of PIMs by post-synthesis reactions. However, this can result in a reduction in intrinsic microporosity due to the additional interchain cohesive interactions. Applications Due to the presence of intrinsic microporosity these polymers have high-free volume, high internal surface area, and have a high affinity for gases. A novel property of PIMs is that they do not possess a network structure and are often freely soluble in organic solvents. This allows PIMs to be precipitated or cast from solution to give microporous powders or self-standing films that are useful for a variety of applications. For example the first commercial application of PIMs was in a sensor developed by 3M. Additionally, due to PIMs affinity for small gases and ability to form self-standing films they are actively being investigated as a membrane material and adsorbent for industrial separation processes such as gas separation and carbon dioxide capture. PIM membranes are also heavily investigated due to their contribution in the revision of the 2008 upper bounds of performance by Robeson, an important parameter in membrane gas separation stating that the permeability must be sacrificed for selectivity. Specifically active areas of PIM membrane research include, enhancing permeability, decreasing aging, and tailoring selectivity. PIMs are also used to create mixed matrix membranes with a variety of material such as inorganic materials, metal-organic frameworks, and carbons.

The series was created by Abby McEnany and Tim Mason, written and executive produced by McEnany, Mason, and Lilly Wachowski, and directed by Mason. Work in Progress stars McEnany in a semi- autobiographical role alongside Karin Anglin, Celeste Pechous, Julia Sweeney (as a fictionalized version of herself), and Theo Germaine. The entire series was written, filmed, and post-produced in Chicago. The first season of Work in Progress, consisting of eight episodes, premiered on Showtime on December 8, 2019, and has received positive critical reception. On January 13, 2020, Showtime renewed the series for a 10-episode second season, to be filmed in Chicago later in the year.  Synopsis  A self-identified \\"fat, queer dyke\\" enters into a transformative relationship during a time of crisis.  Cast  Main * Abby McEnany as Abby, a 45-year old self-identifying \\"fat, queer dyke\\" who lives with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. * Karin Anglin as Alison, Abby's sister. * Celeste Pechous as Campbell, Abby's friend. * Julia Sweeney as a fictionalized version of herself. A recurring plot point is the discomfort Julia's Saturday Night Live character Pat has caused to Abby, for which Julia attempts to make amends. * Theo Germaine as Chris, a 22-year-old barista who enters a relationship with Abby. Chris is a trans man. Germain appears in all episodes of the show but is credited as a special guest star.

Production  According to Germaine, Lilly Wachowski was frequently on the set as an advisor and helped direct the sex scene of the third episode among others. Michael Ognisanti served as the series cinematographer. Because the series is inspired by McEnany's life, the challenge for Ognisanti was to capture the authenticity of the story in the look of the show. For this reason, filming took place in real locations, mostly night interiors, and for lighting they used practical light sources augmented with small LEDs, to avoid making it look artificial. Because of the improvisational style of acting, Ognisanti used two Arri Alexa Mini cameras, for a higher chance to capture unscripted moments that could not be recreated after the fact. The cameras were fitted with Zeiss Super Speed lenses. Ognisanti storyboarded the whole series based on input by Mason in Cinema 4D before they went to shoot on location. Episodes  Reception  Critical reception of Work in Progress has been mostly positive. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator website, reported a 100% critical approval rating with an average rating of 8.03/10 based on 23 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"As radically hilarious as it is relatably uncomfortable, Work in Progress is a stunning debut from co-creator and star Abby McEnany.\\" On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the season is assigned a score of 78 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

The amendment would have outlawed discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and affectional orientation. Coalition spokesman Scott Stebelman said that about fifty people were working together in the new Coalition. Fierce opposition to the proposed amendment was led by UNL psychologist Paul Cameron. Coalition members refused to debate Cameron, saying \\"the coalition's feeling was we would debate any reasonable psychologist, but did not believe Paul Cameron fell into that class.\\" At election time, the amendment was defeated by a 4-to-1 margin. The Coalition refocused on community advocacy instead of elections. The organization that Cameron founded to oppose the amendment would become the Family Research Institute, a nationally influential producer of pseudoscience against homosexuality. The Nebraska Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights argued against Cameron's publications conflating homosexuality with child abuse. Their arguments contributed to Cameron's eventual expulsion from the American Psychological Association. In 1983 the Coalition sponsored an event, the Great Plains Conference of Gay Men and Lesbians. Attendees from the plains states discussed recent failures to pass civil rights measures in the region. The AIDS epidemic The Coalition distributed brochures on safe sex practices in the mid 1980s. The brochures sought to dispel the then-common myth that AIDS is spread by casual contact. The Coalition partnered with the Nebraska AIDS Project in 1986 to mail a survey to medical providers throughout Nebraska asking if providers would accept gay and lesbian patients or patients at risk for HIV. The responses were used to create a referral list of safe providers. The 1990s In 1993 the Nebraska legislature considered a bill, LB 395, to ban employment discrimination against gays and lesbians. California-based Christian fundamentalist leader Lou Sheldon was brought to Lincoln by the Nebraska chapter of the Traditional Values Coalition to speak against LB 395. Sheldon claimed the bill was part of a nationwide anti-family \\"homosexual agenda\\". The Nebraska Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights coordinated a protest to counter Sheldon's statements. About fifty demonstrators appeared in front a local restaurant, the Green Gateau, chosen because of the belief that it had recently fired an employee for being gay. In the 1990s the Coalition sponsored poetry readings and dances that served as an alternative to socializing in gay bars. The 2000s marriage fight The Coalition opposed a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage in Nebraska. After the amendment passed in 2000, the Coalition protested the victory party of the Nebraska Family Council, the organization that had spearheaded the amendment. The Coalition staged a protest for marriage equality in 2002, forming a human chain of supporters around the Nebraska State Capitol. It was the first time since World War II that a human chain was formed around the building. The organization also had social events in 2002 but faded from existence shortly afterward. Same-sex marriage remained unlawful in Nebraska until the 2015 Waters v. Ricketts and Obergefell v. Hodges court rulings.

She has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Surrey since the 2019 general election. Prior to her political career, Coutinho worked for investment bank Merrill Lynch, accounting firm KPMG, and as a special adviser in HM Treasury. Early life Coutinho was born in 1985 in London, England. Her parents emigrated from India in the late 1970s and are of Goan Christian descent. Her father Winston is a retired anaesthetist, and her mother Maria is a GP. Coutinho was privately educated at James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich. She studied mathematics and philosophy at Exeter College, Oxford. After graduating, she worked in the emerging markets equity team as an associate at the investment bank Merrill Lynch for nearly four years. In 2012, Coutinho left the company, and co-founded a literary-themed supper club, The Novel Diner. Two years later, she appeared on the cooking game show The Taste. Coutinho then worked for two years at Iain Duncan Smith's centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice. She then became a programme director for the industry group Housing and Finance Institute. After this, she worked for accounting firm KPMG as their education lead. Coutinho left the company to become a special adviser at HM Treasury. Initially she worked for Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury Julian Smith, and then became an aide to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak. Coutinho has commented that she left KPMG to join the government as a special adviser so that she could help deliver Brexit \\"from the inside\\", which she had supported in the 2016 EU membership referendum. Parliamentary career Coutinho was selected as the Conservative candidate for East Surrey on 11 November 2019. It is a safe Conservative constituency having elected a member of the party since 1918. She was elected as MP in the 2019 general election with a majority of 24,040 (40.3%).

She was appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary at HM Treasury, and joined the advisory board of the centre-right think tank Onward in February 2020. She supported Dominic Cummings for taking a road trip to Durham amid a 2020 controversy. A number of days later, an apparent protest took place as the windows of the East Surrey Conservative Association offices were daubed in black paint.

Prior to the OWL's inception, he played for GC Busan, winning OGN's APEX Season 4 was named the APEX Finals most valuable player. In the Overwatch League, Park signed with the London Spitfire of the OWL in its inaugural season. He won the league's first Grand Finals with the Spitfire, after they defeated the Philadelphia Fusion, and was named the Grand Finals most valuable player.  Early years  Park was born on November 19, 1999 in Jinju, South Korea.  Professional career   GC Busan  Park began his Overwatch career with Korean team GC Busan in April 2017. The team competed in OGN's APEX Season 4, a premier Overwatch tournament series in South Korea. After defeating Cloud 9 KongDoo in the semifinals, they were set to take on RunAway in the best-of-seven finals. Park amassed 134 kills, 44 more than any other player, to only 55 deaths in the series, and led his team to a close 4–3 victory to win the championship. He was named the APEX Finals most valuable player for his performance throughout the series. He picked up another major championship after GC Busan defeated RunAway in the 2017 APAC Premier finals in China.  London Spitfire  Park, along with the entire GC Busan roster, signed with Cloud9's Overwatch League team London Spitfire in November 2017. Within the first two weeks of the 2018 season, Park was fined for giving the finger to his face camera during a league match; although he claimed that it was in response to a joke that was made off-camera by his team backstage, he publicly apologized for the gesture. The team found early success, reaching the Stage 1 Finals. In as 3–2 win over the New York Excelsior in the finals, Park participated in 38.2 percent of his team's kills, better than any other player in the Stage 1 Playoffs. At the end of the 2018 regular season, Park was the highest-rated DPS player across all heroes. The Spitfire defeated the Los Angeles Gladiators and Los Angeles Valiant in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, of the 2018 season playoffs; Park averaged 8,790 damage per 10 minutes in those two matches, second to Philadelphia Fusion's Josh \\"Eqo\\" Corona for all players in the playoffs. The Spitfire played the Fusion in the 2018 Grand Finals. In 3–1 and 3–0 victories over the Fusion, Park performed exceptionally well, most notably securing five final blows playing Tracer in the final 93 seconds on Volskaya Industries to secure a 1–0 lead in the best-of-three series. With numerous highlight-level plays throughout the series, Park was named the Grand Finals Most Valuable Player. As a member of the inaugural season champions, the Spitfire retired Park's number 13 jersey on January 15, 2020.  Seoul Dynasty  On October 22, 2019, the Spitfire agreed to transfer Park, along with teammates Hong \\"Gesture\\" Jae-hee and Choi \\"Bdosin\\" Seung-tae, to the Seoul Dynasty.

Design The single seat, standard class () span) Ilindenka was, like most of its contemporaries, an all-wood sailplane. It had a cantilever, twin spar, shoulder wing with plywood skin around its leading edge ahead of the forward spar. The wing was trapezoidal in plan, with taper on both edges, and set with 2.5° of dihedral. Ailerons occupied about half the trailing edges and Schemp-Hirth type spoilers were mounted at 40% chord. Each wing was braced by a thin strut between rear spar and lower fuselage. The Ilindenka had an oval section, ply-skinned forward fuselage, becoming more rectangular aft. Its cockpit was at the wing leading edge, under a single piece canopy with a fairing behind it which fell away into the upper rear fuselage. Its tall fin was rounded in profile, with a horn balanced rudder of similar area. Its tailplane was mounted well forward on the fin just above the fuselage and carried elevators of similar area to it. It landed on a skid under the forward fuselage. Variants ;Ilindenka 1: ;Ilindenka 1T: ;Ilindenka 2: Operational history The Iindenka first flew in 1953 and was certified to fly loops, rolls and spins. Production numbers are not known but the Airforce Museum in Belgrade holds two examples, though neither was on display in 2009.

She was dropped off at a bus station in Surfers Paradise, Queensland to go to the airport for a planned, long-term vacation in England. She has not been seen in 23 years. Since her 1997 disappearance, police maintained that Marion's disappearance was voluntary, although their attempts to locate her were unsuccessful. But in 2019, after extensive international media coverage and new legal proceedings lodged by the family, her case was taken over by the Unsolved Homicide Squad in Sydney and authorities are now handling it as an active homicide investigation. Marion's case has been featured in a 38-episode podcast, The Lady Vanishes, a Seven News production and one of Apple's Best Listens of 2019. Her case also garnered significant speculation on internet message boards and forums, with theories ranging from identity theft to mental illness to witness protection and murder. Guests on the show include Scotland Yard criminal behavior analyst and founder of Paladin, Laura Richards; retired Victoria (Australia) homicide detective senior sergeant Ron Iddles who has a 99% conviction rate and is the subject of the bestselling book, The Good Cop, by Justine Ford; and Ita Buttrose, an Australian businesswoman and chairperson of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, who knew Marion before she vanished.  Background  Marion Barter was born to Jack and Colleen Wilson in 1945. She had three sisters. In 1967, she married professional football player Johnny Warren but they divorced two years later. She had her first child, Sally Leydon (nee Brown) in 1973, and in 1974, her second child, Owen Brown. Marion and her children's father, Stuart Brown, married in 1977 and divorced in 1979. In 1985, Marion married Ray Barter and divorced five years later. In 1994, Marion purchased a home for $180,000 at 15 Merinda Court in Ashmore and began work as a teacher at The Southport School where she would eventually be awarded the Queensland Teaching Excellence Award in 1996 by Ita Buttrose. But on April 25, 1997, Marion sold her Merinda Court home in a quick sale for $165,000. On May 15, 1997, Marion changed her name via Deed poll to Florabella Natalia Marion Remakel and obtained a passport under her new identity. But she continued to use her regular name at work and in correspondence with family and friends, and never mentioned her name change to anyone. One month later, on June 20, 1997, Marion resigned from The Southport School citing her desire to travel and find a new job teaching in England in her resignation letter. The letter also made a request to renew her teacher's certification for the next school year. On June 22, 1997, she left Australia for a year-long vacation in England with plans to travel throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. While on vacation, Marion sent family, friends, and former students postcards, letters, and gifts from locations around England postmarked: Tunbridge Wells in Kent, Sussex, and London. She called her twenty-four-year-old daughter, Sally Leydon, in late July and early August. They spoke for the last time on the evening of August 1, 1997. Marion mentioned that she was extending her stay in Tunbridge Wells and decided to reschedule her upcoming reservation to ride the Orient Express. This was the last time Marion was ever heard from.  Early investigations  Marion's children became concerned in October 1997, after months of not hearing from her, when she failed to call her son to wish him a happy birthday. Sally called the Commonwealth Bank telebanking line on October 21st, where Marion did her banking, to check for activity on the account, discovering it had been drained of more than $80,000 in daily increments of $5,000 between August and September from branches in Byron Bay, Burleigh Heads, and Ashmore Queensland. She also discovered through a friend at customs that on the morning of August 2, 1997, less than a day after speaking to Sally from Tunbridge Wells in England, her passport returned to Australia via Brisbane. Sally immediately travelled to Byron Bay and filed a police report with this information. Despite never physically sighting Marion, police told Sally that Marion was alive and did not want to be contacted. They marked the report as \\"an occurrence\\" as opposed to an investigation of a missing person. Unhappy with these findings, Marion’s father, Jack Wilson, decided to ask the Salvation Army Missing Persons Bureau for help in locating his daughter, convinced that her decision to leave was out of character for Marion. In March 1999, Jack received a suspicious letter from The Salvation Army claiming that a Missing Person’s police officer spoke to a security officer at Colonial State Bank who said that Marion 'spoke of starting a new life,' and in 1990, (not 1997), withdrew the balance of her account in Ashmore. The inconsistencies and errors in the letter made Sally concerned that the inquiries were not taken seriously. Many years later, the SA apologized and admitted that they never physically sighted Marion nor can they confirm if she truly made the statements in the letter. Marion did not contact her family when Sally got married in 1998 at The Southport School Chapel. Nor did she in 2001, when her first granddaughter was born; in 2003, when her son, Owen, died by suicide; or in 2003, when her father died after a long illness. In 2007, Sally contacted the Australian Federal Police missing persons unit asking for information on the ten-year anniversary of Marion's disappearance. The AFP looked into the case and planned to use the case as the face of their annual \\"Missing Person's Week\\" campaign, hoping the public exposure might help bring in new information. But the New South Wales Police Force barred the use of Marion's story in the campaign, citing the need to protect the investigation despite the fact that Sally was told that there was no on-going investigation. Beginning in 2009, the new cold case detective in Byron Bay uncovered five significant findings: # The name change to Florabella Natalia Marion Remakel in May 1997. # Marion's August 2, 1997 return-flight customs card which claimed she was married, living in Luxembourg as a housewife, and staying in Australia for only three days. # On August 13, 1997, her medicare card was used in Grafton under the name Marion Barter. # Her passport never left the country and her medicare card was never used again. # Police have not seen or spoken to her since 1997 and cannot locate her. In 2010, the lead detective looked into a 2002 Crime Stoppers tip in which a man claimed a missing woman named Marion had been murdered and buried in bushland near the University of New England (Australia) in Armidale. The detective investigated the tip alone, bringing a cadaver dog to his aid, for two days. The search was unsuccessful. In 2011, the Byron Bay missing persons unit removed Marion from the NSW state missing persons register. In 2013, Sally was contacted by a stranger named Clark Hunter via a private Facebook message that stated: \\"Natalia is alive but you (sic) never see her again. It was not her intention to disappear. She was forced.\\" Sally took a screenshot of the message, but the tip was never investigated by police.  Media and subsequent investigations  Seven News released a podcast called The Lady Vanishes in April 2019, which focuses solely on Marion Barter's disappearance. It is hosted by award-winning Freedom of information editor Alison Sandy and investigative reporter Bryan Seymour. As of December, the series has been downloaded over 6 million times. Prior to releasing the podcast, Sally Leydon took NSW police to court for access to her mother's police file to find out why Marion was removed from the State's missing person's register despite never locating her and why police assumed she was intentionally missing. In May 2019, the NSW Missing Persons' Unit disbanded and a new unit was formed. Australian Federal Police Homicide Review unit reopened the case and decided to put Marion Barter on the National Missing Persons register for the first time in 23 years. As of August 2020, the NSW State Coroner announced its decision to hold an inquest into the disappearance and suspected death of Marion Barter. The proceedings, scheduled for 2021, will allow the court to compel witnesses to testify, to disclose all police records concerning her disappearance, and to gather information from other police agencies and organizations in Australia and other countries she may have visited or lived in.

It was Rabbi Deutsch who pushed Winsbacher to choose a Rabbincal career. Roger Winsbacher spent the rest of the war in Switzerland where he continued his studies under Rabbi Haim Gittler. After the war, Winsbacher studied at the Séminaire israélite de France in Paris. Following military service in French Algeria, he became Rabbi of Saint-Louis (Haut-Rhin), and later of Obernai (Bas-Rhin). He was close to Rabbi Sneiders of Basel and looked up to Chief Rabbi Avraham David Horowitz or Strasbourg, becoming one of his most devoted followers. When Rabbi Horowitz made Aliyah to Israel, Winsbacher took his place at Adath Israel, the Polish rite synagogue in Strasbourg. Rabbi Winsbacher taught at the Yeshiva Ketana de Strasbourg where he influenced generations of students. He was known for his pedagogical skills and the clarity of his teaching. He was married to Danielle Weil, a local teacher in Strasbourg and a sister of Liliane Ackermann. The Winsbachers had three sons. When Winsbacher retired as rabbi of Adath Israel, he was succeeded by Michaël Szmerla, the dayan of Strasbourg. Winsbacher died in Strasbourg on February 13, 2012 and was buried the next day in the cimetière \\"Etz Haïm\\" de Cronenbourg,. The funeral was conducted by Chief Rabbi Samuel Yaffe- Schlessinger and in a rare occasion, the coffin was transported to Adath Israel, where Rabbi Szmerla delivered the eulogy and Chief Rabbi of Strasbourg René Gutman recited the Tehillim.

The course of the Cami river crosses the zec du Lac-au-Sable. The Cami river valley is served along its entire length by the Lac-Desprez road, for forestry and recreational tourism activities. Some secondary forest roads serve this valley. Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.

Bitan's Wines) is a family-owned Israeli supermarket chain. Along with its own brand, it owns the Mega chain. As of 2019, Yeinot Bitan runs nearly 200 stores in Israel. History Yeinot Bitan traces its roots to 1982, when Nahum Bitan purchased a small alcohol store in Ashkelon, Israel. In 1995, Bitan purchased a disused movie theater and converted it into a supermarket. The business proceeded to acquire small supermarket chains Hyper Rama () for million, and Yad Yitzhak () for million, in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and after the purchases counted 11 branches throughout Israel. In 2012 Yeinot Bitan purchased yet another chain, Kim'at Hinam Stores (), with 35 branches, more than the brand Yeinot Bitan itself, and a similar revenue. The acquisition, valued at million, was made possible by a million loan from the selling party, and Yeinot Bitan invested an additional million to renovate Kim'at Hinam's branches. Mega acquisition On June 30, 2015, it acquired Mega (), one of the largest and oldest supermarket chains in Israel, active in city centers, for million. The chain had had about 120 branches, bringing Yeinot Bitan's total to over 180, and making it the second-largest in Israel by number of branches. This purchase included Mega's Haredi-oriented chain, Zol BeShefa (), later renamed Shuk Mehadrin (). In order to fund the acquisition, Yeinot Bitan sold real estate worth over million and took on debt likely amounting to hundreds of millions from Bank HaPo'alim, Bank Mizrahi- Tefahot and Harel Group, among others. The joint chain was ordered by the Israel Antitrust Authority to sell multiple branches as a condition for approving the merger, but the chain failed to do so on time, and received a million fine. In 2017, the Yeinot Bitan brand (not including Mega) spun off its 23 city-center branches into a new branch, Yeinot Bitan in the City. The year 2017 proved difficult for the chain and its owners, having disagreements with suppliers, a branch closure due to sanitary problems, and liquidity issues, among others. That year, the chain's owner Nahum Bitan was investigated by the Israel Police for bribery vis-à-vis the mayor of Kfar Sava. He had previously been investigated for the same charge with the mayor of Ashkelon, but the charges had been dropped. In August 2019, Yeinot Bitan settled a class action lawsuit regarding the 2017 sanitary issues, which would see it provide discounts to all customers for a time. 2019 cash crunch In September 2019, to deal with cash flow issues, Yeinot Bitan sold 7 branches, most of them in Tel Aviv, to Fresh Market. In October of the same year, five more branches were sold to Victory for million. In January 2020, two further branches, including its branch at Jerusalem's Malha Mall, were sold to Victory. Also in January, Yeinot Bitan announced a million investment, not yet completed, from Klirmark Capital, a Tel Aviv-based private equity fund. In February, Nahum Bitan stepped down as CEO in favor of Michael Luboschitz, and the company committed to appointing a board of directors. These steps are believed to be linked to the investment. Business and management As of 2019, Yeinot Bitan was the third-largest supermarket chain in Israel by revenue and second biggest by number of branches, with 185 branches, billion in revenue, and 8,200 employees. Its headquarters are in Rishon LeZion, Israel. It operates stores under multiple brands: Yeinot Bitan, Yeinot Bitan in the City, Mehadrin Market (geared at the Haredi public) and Mega BaIr. Yeinot Bitan is run primarily by the Bitan family. Nahum Bitan heads the company, with his wife Nurit being co-owner. Nahum's brother Efi manages operations, his daughter Elinor is the legal adviser, and his son-in- law manages the import of household items. Yossi Bitan, Nahum's son, is deputy CEO.

It was founded by Cecil Chetwynd Kerr, Marchioness of Lothian. It is a category A listed building. History Lady Cecil Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot married John Kerr, 7th Marquess of Lothian on 12 July 1831 and went to live in Scotland with her husband. Her favourite home was Monteviot House, but the family seat was Newbattle Abbey. She moved to Monteviot in 1840 in order to attend her nearest Episcopal church which was in Kelso. Her husband died in 1841. She took an increasing interest in the religious Oxford Movement who argued that Anglicanism needed to reintroduce aspects of Roman Catholicism into their high church practices. The followers were known as Tractarians and her spiritual advisor John Henry Newman was a leading thinker in the group. She founded St John's church in Jedburgh Kerr funded the creation of this Episcopal church in Jedburgh because it was near to Monteviot. The church cost £4,000 and it could seat 200 people. It was designed by architect John Hayward with an interior attributed to William Butterfield and a lychgate that was his work. The foundation stone was laid in July 1843Kelso Mail, 17 July 1843. Cited in Tristram Clarke MA PhD, \\"A display of Tractarian energy: St John's Episcopal Church, Jedburgh\\", 1997, Scottish Church History Society Vol XXVII . It was consecrated just a year later on 15 August 1844Ed. W H Teale, \\"Six sermons preached at the consecration of the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Jedburgh, in the Diocese of Glasgow\\" (Edinburgh, 1845) . The sermons on that day were continued on the next day and on the 18 August with contributions by John Keble, Dr. W.F. Hook, William Dodsworth and Robert Wilberforce. The consecration, involving a procession of four bishops, forty clergy and a robed choir from Edinburgh, gathered a good deal of critical attention. The new incumbent, Reverend William Spranger White, was encouraged to hold daily services, weekly communions and to make sure that the church was never locked. Two years later Newman became a Roman Catholic and in 1851 the church's founder Cecil Kerr converted to Catholicism. After she converted, Lady Cecil of Lothian went on to build a church, St David's, for the Catholic population in Dalkeith. She never entered the church again but it did enjoy the support of her nephew Bertram Arthur Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury and her son, Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian who was Secretary of State for Scotland. The church's founder died on a religious visit to Rome in 1877 and her body was buried in her Dalkeith church at the foot of the alter. From 1962 to 1967 John Habgood was Rector of St John's Church, Jedburgh. He would go on to be a bishop and a lord. The church is a category A listed building.

He served as First Lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, and died in detention in the Soviet Union.  Biography  Fumitaka Konoe was born in Kyoto as the eldest son of Fumimaro Konoe and his wife Chiyoko, (from a branch of the Mōri clan). The Konoe were members of the kazoku nobility and the lain was part of the Fujiwara northern house, the leading go-sekke (five houses) lineage. After graduating from Gakushūin junior high school, Fumitaka Konoe was sent to the United States to study as a diplomat. He graduated from Lawrenceville School and studied at Princeton University. He actively participated as an amateur golfer during his stay in America and worked as the manager of a golf club. He returned to Japan in 1938 to become his father's executive secretary. The following year, in 1939, he became a lecturer at Toa Doubunin University (The Tung Wen College) in Shanghai concurrently becoming became a student director (salary: ¥ 117.60 per month, overseas allowance: ¥ 54.40 per month). With the diplomatic situation in China between the Koumintang government and the Imperial Japanese Army becoming increasing strained, Konoe felt the need for direct negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek to avoid open warfare. He cultivated an association with the daughter of an important government official who guided him to Chongqing; this private diplomacy was discovered by the Kempeitai, and he was then recalled to Japan because this was seen by the cabinet as a problem. The woman he had made an acquaintance with was a Chinese spy - there is also a theory that he was ordered to return home for fear that he would leak confidential information to Zheng Pingru. After his return to Japan, Konoe created a youth political organization called the Shonen Doshi- kai (青年同志会) to continue to insist on direct negotiations to prevent war in China. His actions were regarded as a problem by military authorities, in February 1940 he was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army. Due to his family connections, he was fast track promoted to First Lieutenant and was assigned to a Manchukuo-based artillery regiment. In the midst of the Pacific War, he was married in Harbin in 1944 to Empress Teimei's niece, Masako Otani. On August 19, 1945, four days after the official end of the war, he was arrested by a Soviet GRU Smersh unit and taken as a prisoner to the Soviet Union. He was moved through 15 different detention camps in Siberia over the next ten years. During his detention, he refused to use his rank as an officer as a shield against labor, and abuse. In 1955, during Japanese-Soviet diplomatic normalization negotiations, Prime Minister Ichirō Hatoyama made a formal request for his release, and presented a petition signed by hundreds of thousands of people from Japan; however, the Soviet Union refused. In 1956 it was reported that he had died at Ivanovo camp (Ministry of Home Affairs No. 48 Rageri) Ivanovo Oblast, Lezhnevsky district, Cherntsy village. The cause of death is thought to be cerebral hemorrhage due to arteriosclerosis and acute nephritis, but there is also a theory he was assassinated by the Soviet Union.In Ivanovo camp, 9 days before Konoe's death, at the Khabarovsk trial he was found guilty, Tomio Karasawa's (fellow inmate) death was by hanging. - Kato Tetsuro, (lecture summary) 63rd new mikikai lecture, (war memory zoruge incident, 731 unit, Siberian camp) 2015 October 15.

She has previously served as Professor of Paediatrics and Child Health at the Aga Khan University.  Early life and education  Zaidi was born in Pakistan. Her mother is a paediatrician and her father was an anesthesiologist. Her father was appointed the national physician of the Pakistan men's national field hockey team, and Zaidi would often accompany him on their tours. Whilst visiting a cousin in the United Kingdom Zaidi became interested in the microbiology and applied to work in a clinical commercial laboratory. Zaidi eventually studied medicine at Aga Khan University and earned her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1988. During her degree she enjoyed her courses in community health and spent time working in the Pakistan’s urban squatter settlements (katchi abadis). She has spoken about Claire Panosian Dunavan, a Visiting Professor from University of California, Los Angeles, being one of her inspirations. Zaidi was one of the first cohorts of medical students to graduate Aga Khan and was the inaugural winner of the Best Medical Graduate Award. After graduating she worked on a United States Agency for International Development program in remote northern Pakistani territories (now Gilgit-Baltistan), which inspired her to dedicate her career to global public health. Her project involved establishing a community surveillance program for diarrhoeal disease and to identify what infrastructure the Aga Khan Health Services needs to implement to improve healthcare. She completed her residency training in paediatrics at Duke University and also undertook medical microbiology at Duke University. She took specialist training in paediatric infectious diseases at Boston Children's Hospital. Zaidi earned a Masters in Tropical Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 1999.  Research and career  In 2002, after completing her specialist training, Zaidi returned to Pakistan. She was one of the youngest faculty members to be promoted to full Professor when she became Chair of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at Aga Khan University. In 2011 she was awarded an endowed position; the Ruby and Karim Bahudar Ali Jessani Professor and Chair. At Aga Khan University Zaidi established a state-of-the- art laboratory that investigates paediatric infectious diseases. Zaidi is the only woman from the developing world to contribute a chapter to Nelson Textbook of Paediatrics. Zaidi was the first recipient of the Caplow's Children's Prize for her work supporting poverty-stricken communities in Karachi in 2013. She used the prize to reduce neonatal deaths in Rehri Goth. Her efforts focussed on eliminating malnutrition, improving access to healthcare and vaccinations and training for community health professionals. She developed programs that supported mother and child health before, during and after children were born. Zaidi estimated that the program would reduce child mortality by 65%, saving the lives of 200 children over two years. In 2014 Zaidi was shortlisted for physician of the year by Medscape. She is Director of the Vaccine Development, Surveillance, and Enteric and Diarrhoea Diseases programs and co-Director of the Maternal, Newborn & Child Health Discovery & Tools programs at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In this capacity Zaidi supports the development of new vaccinations to protect communities around the world. Zaidi uses social media to share her work in public health using the Twitter handle @AnitaEDD. She has written for The Conversation, the Skoll Foundation, Project Syndicate and HuffPost.

During the club's heyday in the 1950s through the 1960s, acts such as Ike & Tina Turner, Chuck Berry, and Bob Kuban and the In-Men performed at the Club Imperial. Jimmy Forrest, known for his 1952 hit \\"Night Train,\\" played piano at the club for years. In the following decades, the building went through different ownership and was almost demolished in 2018, but preservationists fought to save the site of the historic music venue.  History  The two-story building which is the site of the Club Imperial and the Imperial Hall was built in 1928. It was a dance hall, bowling alley, and restaurant complex in an all-white neighborhood. In 1952, George Edick from Chicago purchased the hall, and then booked swing bands such as Stan Kenton's orchestra. Soon, Rhythm & Blues was taking over the city as the word got across the river of the exciting bands in East St. Louis. In 1954, bandleader Ike Turner relocated his Kings of Rhythm from Clarksdale to East St. Louis where he built his own nightclub, Manhattan Club. Edick got word of the buzz about Turner and booked his band to revitalize the Club Imperial. Turner's King's of Rhythm became the hottest attraction in the St. Louis music scene, attracting black and white audiences. Gabriel, a DJ and musician who started his career on St. Louis radio in 1953 remembered: \\"Ike Turner just took over this area. He created a ripple effect with his energy and ambition, he sent word back to Mississippi and was followed here by Albert King and Little Milton, he was a premier blues pianist who later became a great guitarist.\\" After Ike & Tina Turner attained success with their single \\"A Fool In Love\\" and moved to California, they continued to occasionally perform at the Club Imperial. They recorded their first live album, Ike & Tina Turner Revue Live, at the club in 1964. Greg Edick, son of the owner George Edick, grew up in the club and later took over ownership. He recalled that Jimi Hendrix was a guitarist in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, but he was fired for his long solo that \\"brought the dancers to a halt.\\" Hendrix met Jazz musician Miles Davis at the club, and Davis remarked that Hendrix's guitar sounded like a \\"machine gun.\\" The Turners were performing at the club in July 1966 when the Rolling Stones paid a visit and invited them to be the opening act on their 1966 British tour. Robert Vroman bought the building in August 2017 in an auction. By the following year, no one offered to buy it for renovation and that it's too dilapidated to save, he said. A beauty products company wanted to buy the building, demolish it and build a new structure. In January 2018, The St. Louis Preservation Board unanimously denied a demolition permit for the former Club Imperial.

He initially gained recognition for a series of realistic painted portraits of riders on the New York City Subway system. In 2019, he was a finalist in the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition for his portrait of sculptor, John Ahearn. Early life and education Devon Rodriguez was born in 1996 in the South Bronx. At age 8, he began doing graffiti with his friends but, after being arrested at age 13, he turned his attention to portraits. In 2010, he applied for the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, but wasn't accepted. He then attended Samuel Gompers High School in the Bronx for two years before being accepted to attend the High School of Art and Design in 2012. He graduated from that school in 2014. He later attended the Fashion Institute of Technology. Career While Rodriguez was still in high school, sculptor John Ahearn attended a school portrait exhibit and took notice of Rodriguez's realist oil paintings of subway passengers.

A charismatic performer who did not record until her thirties, her work encompassed blues, jazz, protest songs, experimental music and spoken word recordings. Life and career Colette Magny performing in 1975 She was born in Paris, and from 1948 worked as a secretary and translator for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Fluent in English, she became a fan of American blues and jazz singers such as Bessie Smith and Ella Fitzgerald, and was taught guitar by jazz musician Claude Luter. She also started writing songs. Her mother took up acting in the 1950s, and Colette began singing her own songs and blues standards in Paris clubs. Pierre Perrone, Obituary - Colette Magny, The Independent, 25 June 1997. Retrieved 12 December 2019 She made her first recordings in 1958, on an album by trumpeter and bandleader Gilles Thibaut, Des classiques du jazz. After appearing at the Contrescarpe cabaret in 1962, she was discovered by the singer Mireille Hartuch, who featured her on her TV show Le Petit Conservatoire de la Chanson. She received rave reviews, and gave up her full- time job for a musical career. She signed with CBS Records, and her first single, the self-penned \\"Melocoton\\" (\\"Peach\\"), which featured Mickey Baker on guitar as did many of her later recordings, became a hit in France in 1963. Her first album, self-titled but sometimes known as Les Tuileries, also featured her musical treatments of poems by Victor Hugo, Rimbaud, Rilke and Louis Aragon, as well as blues classics including \\"Saint James Infirmary\\" and Bessie Smith's \\"Any Woman's Blues\\". Jason Birchmeier, Biography, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 12 December 2019 Her second album, the experimental \\"Avec\\" poème (1966), released on the record label established by Marcel Mouloudji, contained both spoken and sung texts over electroacoustic music and musique concrète by the Surrealist-influenced composer André Almuró. Magny became increasingly supportive of political activism. Her song \\"Le mal du vivre\\" was banned by ORTF, the state broadcasting network, and marked her out as France's first protest singer. Her recordings were issued by Le Chant du Monde. Her next album, also self-titled, featured her songs \\"Vietnam 67\\" and \\"Viva Cuba\\", together with one celebrating a strike of port workers, as well as further settings of poems and metaphysical texts. During the events and riots of May 68, she actively supported students and workers at sit-ins and through benefit concerts. She wrote the song \\"Les militants\\" for the protesters, and later also issued a spoken word album, Magny 68/69. She produced three albums in the early 1970s - Feu et rythme (1970), which won the Grand Prix du Disque from the Académie Charles Cros; Répression (1972), which concerned censorship and was supportive of the Black Panther movement; and Transit (1975), which she recorded with free jazz performers including saxophonist Maurice Merle. Her 1977 album Visage-Village was recorded with the rock group Dharma and accordionist Lino Leonardi. According to writer Benoît Houzé, \\"throughout her experiments, Magny always kept an artistic generosity which clearly binds most of her songs, as 'avant-gardist' as they can be, to the tradition of French chanson populaire.\\" Her 1979 album Je Veux Chaanter was recorded with, and included songs written by, children with mental disabilities in the Institut médico-pédagogique at Fontenoy-le-Château, and was performed partly with home- made instruments. In 1980, she released two single-sided spoken word albums, one of poems by Antonin Artaud and the other of text by the Swiss artist Sylvie Duval. Magny moved to live near Aveyron in south-west France, and her recordings became more mellow in tone, her 1983 album Chansons pour Titine even including Cole Porter's \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\". Her final album, Kevork (1989), included a song in praise of the turkey, a bird which, once released from domestication, can revert to its wild state. Magny suffered from health problems including obesity and, in later years, a spinal disease that confined her to a bed or wheelchair. She died in 1997, aged 70.

But really it came to finding great characters with great > story, and who are credible in the fashion space. And that was a big driver > in terms of the casting.

Episodes The contestants are shown in a modern warehouse space that serves as both the workroom, and on show days, a runway space complete with area for hair and makeup stations. A fully-stocked fabrics and notions “closet” is adapted for each challenge, and producers will get any item that is needed outside of the supplies provided. Alexa Chung and Tan France serve as both hosts and judges; with two or three more judges for each challenge. Each episode has them introducing the theme, and revealing the guest judge. The designers then each occupy a large work table, and pull fabrics and supplies. The bulk of the pre-runway show overviews their designing and construction process, typically over two work days. The runway contest itself has a catwalk, and fully digitized floors and walls so each show has a different feel yet comes off as a professional presentation. During the show the judges comments are overheard; following the catwalk show the judges visit each entry, inspect the work, and ask questions of the designer. Following the judges deliberations the winner, and bottom two entries are revealed. After more discussion one or more designers are eliminated. Season one episodes were posted for streaming .

Together with Charles Gemora, Ray Corrigan, Steve Calvert, and George Barrows, he was known as one of Hollywood's \\"Gorilla Men\\" – performers who wore a gorilla suit to portray apes on stage and screen. Among the films he appeared in were The Ape Man (1943) with Bela Lugosi, Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (1941) with W.C. Fields, and the adventure serials Jungle Girl (1941) and Perils of Nyoka (1942). Early life Sources indicate that Emil Imra Van Horn was born October 3, 1907 in Ridgway, Pennsylvania, one of the six children of Joseph Van Horn and Elizabeth Lind, immigrants from Austria-Hungary. Joseph Van Horn was an industrial machinist who altered his family's surname from Horansky to Van Horn after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. By the 1930s, Emil Van Horn owned a number of concession stands with his younger brother, Arvine. Performing career Van Horn was a diminutive man who had trained as a circus tumbler and acrobat. He stated in interviews that after meeting noted Hollywood gorilla impersonator Charles Gemora, he decided to construct his own gorilla costume, and studied the behavior of gorillas donated to San Diego Zoo by Martin and Osa Johnson. From 1933, he appeared in stage productions such as A Night of Terror and Murder at Midnight as \\"King Kivu\\", \\"Engagi\\", or \\"Ingagi\\" (the latter being the name of a 1930 gorilla movie which had featured Charles Gemora). He also performed at the 1939 New York World's Fair. His most prominent film role was probably The Ape Man (1943), supporting Bela Lugosi. Variety's review remarked that \\"Emil Van Horn makes a very sympathetic gorilla.\\" His other significant big-screen ape roles were the Republic serials Jungle Girl (1941) and Perils of Nyoka (1942). He also featured in Never Give a Sucker an Even Break and Keep 'Em Flying (both 1941) as a gorilla who surprises and Lou Costello, respectively. With the exception of The Ape Man, Van Horn was rarely credited on screen, leading to some uncertainty over the precise number of films in which he appeared. Van Horn also performed in burlesque stage shows with a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" theme, and focused on this work after film offers waned; his final confirmed screen gorilla role was 1948's Are You With It? In 1950, he made a public appearance (in costume) at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo as part of birthday celebrations for the zoo's gorilla, Bushman. After a legal copyright dispute in 1951 over his use of the name \\"Ingagi\\", he adopted another stage name, \\"Tomba\\", including a tour of Canada later that year. Personal life Few details are known about Van Horn's private life compared to his fellow \\"Gorilla Men\\", and he rarely permitted the media to photograph him out of costume. It is documented that in 1937, he married fortune-teller \\"Gypsy\\" Vilma Horvath in New York City, and in 1944 the couple opened a nightclub on upper Broadway called The Golden Fiddle. Their marriage appears to have ended by March 1950, when it was announced that Van Horn and his Chicago burlesque stage partner, Carol Borgia (variously Karol Borja), were engaged to be married. However, the following month Borgia brought a charge of disorderly conduct against Van Horn. Although the charge was dismissed, Van Horn was ordered by the court to sign a $1,000 peace bond. Newspaper coverage of the incident – which arose from a curious argument regarding the use of a live snake in their stage routine – referred to Van Horn and Borgia as \\"adagio dancers\\". In 1951, Billboard mentioned that Emil Van Horn was married to a Marsha Wayne; this marriage ended in divorce in Florida in 1956. It is unclear from available sources whether Carol Borgia was Marsha Wayne's stage name, or another woman entirely. In 1952, Van Horn was elected as a trustee of the newly-formed Chicago Entertainers Union, a short-lived union of local striptease artistes., Final years and death Van Horn suffered a setback after he was deprived of his gorilla suit, either through theft, or – according to some sources – when the suit was confiscated by a Florida landlady because Van Horn owed her unpaid rent. The loss of his costume threw Van Horn out of regular employment, and his final years were spent in poverty in New Orleans. He made occasional appearances as an unbilled extra in films such as A Hole in the Head (1959) and Hotel (1967). He died of cirrhosis, aged 59, in New Orleans' Charity Hospital in 1967.Certificate of Death: Van Horn, Emil. City File No. 670001315. City of New Orleans. State of Louisiana. Issued: February 20, 1967. Although some authors have stated that he died on New Year's Day, vital records give his date of death as February 15, 1967.

It is in the municipality of Rivière-Éternité, Quebec, Canada. The Brébeuf Lake is integrated into the zec du Lac-au-Sable, a controlled exploitation zone. The southwest part of Brébeuf Lake is served by a forest road from the village of Saint-Félix-d'Otis where it connects to route 170. Few other secondary forest roads serve the lake sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.(Saint John River) Open Street Map - Accessed January 9, 2019 Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second. The surface of Brébeuf Lake is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to the end of March.  Geography  The main watersheds near Brébeuf Lake are: * north side: Bailoquet Lake, Éternity Lake, Otis Lake, Lac à la Croix, Saguenay River; * east side: Périgny Lake, Saint- Jean river, Petit Saguenay River, Saguenay River; * south side: rivière à la Catin, Cami River, Lac des Canots, Pierre River, Vipère lake, Cinto lake, rivière à Mars North-West; * west side: Pierre River, Bras de Ross, Ha!

This lake includes a peninsula attached to the south shore forming a strait of a hundred meters along the north shore of the lake; this peninsula forms on the east side of \\"Anse à Taschereau\\". Brébeuf Lake is mainly fed by the Pierre River, Bras de Ross, the Papinachois stream and the outlet of Rond Lake. The main bays around the lake are: \\"Anse à Bacalem\\", \\"Anse à la Balle\\" and \\"Anse à Taschereau\\". The Mont du Lac Bruno (altitude: ) is located at on the southwest shore.

Toponymy  Born in Condé-sur-Vire, in France, the Jesuit father Jean de Brébeuf (1593-1649) came to New France, in 1625. He was a missionary at the Innu, near Quebec City, then in Huronia where he founded a mission. He was there with Father Gabriel Lalemant when, on March 16, the Iroquois carried out a deadly attack on the Wendat (Huron) establishments. Fathers Brébeuf and Lalemant are then brought back to mission St. Ignace Mission (region of Midland (Ontario)) where they die after being tortured. Pope Pius XI canonized him on June 20, 1930, along with six other Jesuits who were victims of the same fate, between 1642 and 1649. The toponym \\"Lac Brébeuf\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

He owned a hardware store in Lakin, Kansas and was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1912 as a Republican and in 1914 as a Democrat. He switched parties due to his opposition to Prohibition. During his first term in the Kansas of Representatives in 1913, Representatives Zutavern introduced bills to punish those who buy or possess liquor in the State of Kansas, to prohibit the teaching of religion in Kansas public schools and to provide salaries for undersheriffs in counties with a population of between 18,000 - 25,000 people. On February 10, 1913, Representative Zutavern motioned to adjourn the House of Representatives so House members could attend a reception honoring Gov. George H. Hodges and First Lady Ora Hodges.

The Kansas Medical Society also gave a satisfactory rating to his Progressive Party opponent, W.H. Maybach. On January 20, 1915, Representative Zutavern sponsored House Resolution 20, which required the sergeant-at-arms of the Kansas House of Representatives to provide disinfected drinking cups to each member of the House of Representatives.

He was a prolific writer on art history and art theory.  Life  Youth  Born in Pistoia, he first studied at the town's Collegio Forteguerri before moving on to the University of Pisa, where he studied jurisprudence under professor Giuseppe Paribeni, also from Pistoia. He proved more suited to studying classic Italian literature, principally Dante, and fine arts. After graduating he went to Rome, where he studied paintings, sculptures, prints and monuments and talked with artists. Florence Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany summoned him to Florence to head the Gallerie fiorentine. He took office in the 1770s and added captions with the artist, title and date to each work in the Uffizi. He was an extraordinary functionary of the grand-ducal court, acting as director of the Uffizi, secretary to the Accademia di Belle Arti and display consultant to the Medici's palazzi and villas. He also befriended Antonio Canova, Raffaello Sanzio Morghen, Francesco Bartolozzi, Vittorio Alfieri, Domenico Monti, Giovanni Fantoni, Ugo Foscolo and Giovanni Battista Zannoni. During the French occupation of Florence in 1799 he became a major figure in saving the museum's artworks from seizure by the occupiers, ensuring the Uffizi lost no major works other than the Medici Venus. Between June and October 1800, fearing French troops would return to Florence, he decided to move the Uffizi artworks to safety. On 14 October 1800, after the defeat of the \\"Royal Grand Ducal Regency\\", Puccini set off from Livorno for Palermo with 75 crates containing the best statues and paintings from the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti collection. In 1803, after the end of the second French occupation and Charles Louis Bourbon's arrival in Tuscany to be the first ruler of the new Kingdom of Etruria, the artworks were returned to Florence and Puccini resumed his role as director.  Last years  He also began to write essays, his first being ”Esame critico dell'opera sulla pittura di Daniele Wèbb” (\\"Critical examination of the painting of Daniele Wèbb\\"). He also wrote on literature, his best work in that area being his translation of Catullus. He died in Florence - Giovanni Battista Zannoni wrote a funerary elegy, a solemn funeral for him was arranged by the Accademia pistoiese (to which Puccini had presented his “Sullo Stato delle belle arti in Toscana”) and Tommaso's nephew Niccolò Puccini had a memorial erected to him in the gardens of Villa Puccini di Scornio with an inscription by Pietro Contrucci.

Forrestal Building, the Smithsonian Institution Building (\\"The Castle\\") and the National Mall in the background (1990). A urban park memorializing Benjamin Banneker is located in southwest Washington, D.C., one half mile (800 m) south of the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Castle\\" on the National Mall. The park features a prominent overlook at the south end of L'Enfant Promenade and Tenth Street SW.Coordinates of Benjamin Banneker Park, Washington, D.C.: A traffic circle, named Banneker Circle SW, surrounds the overlook. A grassy slope descends steeply from the traffic circle to the Southwest Freeway (Interstate 395), Ninth Street SW and Maine Avenue SW. The National Park Service (NPS) operates the park as part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks administrative unit. The NPS erected a historical marker near the park's entrance in 1997.(1) (2) The park is now at stop number 8 on Washington's Southwest Heritage Trail.(1) (2) In 1967, landscape architect Daniel Urban Kiley completed the design of the \\"Tenth Street Overlook\\". After the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency completed construction of the Overlook in 1969, the Agency transferred the Overlook to the NPS in 1970. The elliptical wide overlook provides elevated views of the nearby Southwest Waterfront, Washington Channel, East Potomac Park, Potomac River and more distant areas. The centerpiece of the overlook's modernist plaza is a large conical fountain that projects water more than 30 feet in the air and catches it in a circular basin made from honed green granite. The rings of the fountain and basin in the center of the site are reiterated in the benches, double rows of London plane trees, and low concrete walls that establish the plaza's edge. The ground plane is paved with granite squares, a continuation of L'Enfant Promenade's materials. The ground plane is concave, and with the trees and fountain helps define the spatial volume of the plaza. In 1970, the District of Columbia City Council passed a resolution that petitioned the NPS to rename the Overlook as Banneker Park, arguing that the council had already renamed the adjacent highway circle as Banneker Circle, S.W. The NPS thereupon hosted a dedication ceremony in 1971 that renamed the Overlook as \\"Benjamin Banneker Park\\".Bedini, 1999, p. 318. \\"In the two centuries since Banneker's death, his achievements have been forgotten or misrepresented ..... In November 1971, on the anniversary of Banneker's birthday, the secretary of the interior authorized the 10th Street Overlook outside L'Enfant Plaza in Washington to be renamed and dedicated by the mayor as Benjamin Banneker Park. Once again, the reasons presented by the speakers on the occasion and widely reported by the press had been all based on erroneous information: Banneker was hailed for his contribution after L'Enfant was dismissed and Banneker \\"saved the plan by reconstructing it from memory”.\\" Following completion of a restoration project, the park was ceremoniously rededicated in 1997 to again commemorate Banneker.(1) (2) However, a 2016 NPS publication later noted that the NPS had renamed the Overlook to commemorate Banneker even though the area has no specific connection to Banneker himself. In 1998, the 105th United States Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Washington Interdependence Council of the District of Columbia to establish at the council's expense a memorial on federal land in the District that would commemorate Banneker's accomplishments.Public Law 101-355 (November 6, 1998) states in Title V, Section 512 (112 Stat. 3266): \\"SEC. 512.

In 2006, the Council held a charrette to select the artist that would design the memorial.Comcast News Makers video: Construction of the memorial was expected to begin after the United States Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved the memorial's design and location in accordance with the legislation that authorized the establishment of the memorial and with the United States Code (40 U.S.C. § 8905). However, the proposed memorial had by 1999 become a $17 million project that would contain a visitors' center near the \\"Castle\\" at the north end of the Promenade, a clock atop a tall pedestal at the midpoint of the Promenade, a statue of Banneker in the park's circle at the south end of the Promenade and a skyway over Interstate 395 that would connect the park to the waterfront. . After considering the proposal, the National Capital Memorial Commission rejected the placement of the statue in the park and decided to consult with the District of Columbia government about placing a Banneker memorial at the midpoint of the Promenade. The legislative authority relative to locating the Memorial on federal land lapsed in 2005. This did not preclude the location of the memorial on lands such as the road right-of-way in the Promenade that are under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia's government. During the 2000s, various organizations proposed to develop at the site of Benjamin Banneker Park a number of large facilities including a baseball stadium (later constructed elsewhere in D.C. as Nationals Park), the National Museum of African American History and Culture, a National Children's Museum and a National Museum of the American Latino. In 2004, the D.C. Preservation League listed the Park as one of the most endangered places in the District because of such proposals to redevelop the park's area. The League stated that the park, \\"Designed by renowned landscape architect Daniel Urban Kiley ... is culturally significant as the first public space in Washington named for an African American and is usually included in Black History tours\\". In 2006, the District government and the Federal Highway Administration issued an environmental assessment for \\"improvements\\" to the promenade and park that described a number of projects that could redevelop the area containing the park. In 2011, a proposal surfaced that would erect a structure housing a \\"National Museum of the American People\\" at or near the site of the park.(1) (2) In 2012, the United States Army Corps of Engineers determined that Benjamin Banneker Park was not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.(1) (2) However, the District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office (DC SHPO) did not concur with this determination. The DC SHPO stated that additional research and coordination with the NPS would be needed before it could make a final determination of eligibility. In 2014, the DC SHPO concurred with the superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks that the park was eligible for inclusion in the National Register as an integral component of the 10th Street Promenade/Banneker Overlook composition, but not as an independent entity. In January 2013, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) accepted \\"The SW Ecodistrict Plan\\" (see: Southwest Ecodistrict). The Plan recommended the redesign of Benjamin Banneker Park and adjacent areas to accommodate one or more new memorials, museums and/or landscaping.(1) (2) in 2013, the NPS issued a \\"Cultural Landscapes Inventory\\" report for the park. The report described the features, significance and history of the park and its surrounding area, as well the planning processes that had influenced the park's construction and development. In September 2014, the NCPC accepted an addendum to the SW Ecodistrict Plan. The addendum stated: \\"A modern, terraced landscape at Banneker Park is envisioned to enhance the park and to provide a gateway to the National Mall.\\" In April 2017, the NCPC approved plans for a staircase and ramp that would connect the park with Washington's Southwest Waterfront and that would add lighting and trees to the area. The NCPC and the NPS intended the project to be an interim improvement that could be in place for ten years while the area awaits redevelopment.(1) (2) (3) Construction began on the project in September 2017 and was completed during the spring of 2018.(1) (2) =Benjamin Banneker Park, Arlington County, Virginia= Benjamin Banneker: SW-9 Intermediate Boundary Stone of the District of Columbia (2012) An park in Arlington County, Virginia, memorializes Banneker and the survey of the boundaries of the District of Columbia, in which he participated.

The CEO came back from maternity leave in 2013 and employed a qualified accountant, Fiona Hardie, as Chief Financial Officer. They established a new professional accounting system whereby all the schools used one central finance office- and the only delegated power was petty cash, and that had a top limit of £50. Though salaries was outsourced, financial planning was done by the finance officer. In one school, with falling rolls the salaries used up 103% of the budget. The finances were sorted by creating two mixed classes; years 3-4 and 5-6. Two teachers were redeployed to other schools in the academy. Carr received an OBE that December. More schools joined WISE, none were refused because of demographics or location, but only when the member schools didn't have the financial capability to absorb them. In a YouTube video made for Department for Education (DfE) in 2017, Carr and Hardie explained the approach they used in the next four years. As more schools joined the group, more staff were taken on centrally to handle the complex education bureaucracy.

On the 11th, the Spaniards resisted the French in house-to-house fighting and were able to destroy the cannons in the castle. The four British vessels evacuated the Spanish forces and many of the town's inhabitants. The next day the British landed at Bermeo the troops and civilians they had taken on.

He transferred to in August 1816 at Jamaica, exchanging with Commander George Bennet Allen, of Rifleman. Royalist returned to England and was paid off in Autumn. By 1817 she was at Chatham, presumably in ordinary as there is no record of subsequent commissioning or commanders. =Disposal= The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Royalist brig, of 382 tons\\", lying at Chatham, for sale on 3 February 1819. She sold on that day to W.S.Harper for £1,130. =Post-script= Parliament voted a special grant to the officers and crews that served under Admiral Lord Viscount Keith on the north coast of Spain and the coast of France in the years 1812, 1813, and 1814.

She was lost on her fourth voyage.British Southern Whale Fishery Database – Voyages: Royalist. Royalist first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1820 with Smith, owner, and trade London-Southern Fishery.LR (1820), Supple.pages \\"R\\", Seq.№R39. She first appeared in the Register of Shipping (RS) in 1821 with J.Cook, master, Smith, owner, and trade London- Southern Fishery.RS (1820), Seq.№493. Lloyd's Register gave her origins as \\"King's Yard\\", i.e., a Royal Navy Dockyard, but gave no date. The Register of Shipping gave her origins as Chatham in 1812. There is no naval vessel of the burthens the registers gave that were launched at Chatham in 1812 or so and sold in 1819 or so. By 1833, Lloyd's Register showed her as having been built in a King's Yard in 1808. It also showed her as having been lengthened and almost rebuilt in 1819,LR (1833), Seq.№558. something that explains the increase in her burthen between her naval service and her service as a whaler.  1st whaling voyage (1820–1823)  Captain J. Cook sailed from London on 2 May 1820. He returned on 13 May 1823 with 480 casks of whale oil.  2nd whaling voyage (1823–1826)  Captain J. Cook sailed from London on 28 August 1823. He returned on 26 May 1826 with 600 casks of whale oil, worth £14,040.  3rd whaling voyage (1823–1826)  Captain Lyme Harris (and his wife), sailed from London on 26 September 1826, bound for Timor. He returned on 24 March 1829, with 500 casks of whaler oil. A court case determined that an ordinary seaman's share of the cargo was worth £100 5s 8d.  4th whaling voyage (1829–1832)  Captain Thomas Stephen Harris sailed on 24 June 1829, bound for the seas off Japan. At various time she was reported at Guam, Manila, and the Moluccas. Royalist had undergone small repairs in 1826 and 1829. Fate Royalist struck a reef on one of the Philippine Islands circa July September 1832. She was taken in to Ternate, Moluccas.

In other definitions, poets who stopped writing and publishing during the Cultural Revolution and returned after that can also be generally considered as \\"returned.\\" However, the term only refers to those who were expelled before the Cultural Revolution, according to the mainstream opinions from Chinese literary scholars. The Returned Poets and their works signified a strong desire, not only to repair the damage caused by the politicization of poetry, but also revive and reconstruct the contemporary Chinese poetic paradigm. The Gang of Four was overthrown in 1976 and The Cultural Revolution ended after the shift of power in the Communist Party of China (CPC). Deng Xiaoping came into power in 1978 and a series of political rehabilitation (平反冤假错案) also started at the same year. As a result, poets, alone with other types of rightist and the Educated Youth (知识青年), returned and regain their right to write and publish their poems. The Returned Poets were so named because most of the their poems published after the Cultural Revolution were coincidentally relevant to the concept of return returned, either literally or metaphorically. For instance, the first album published by Ai Qing (艾青) after his return, was literally named as The Song of Return (归来的歌). Liu Shahe (流沙河) wrote a poem called Return (归来). Liang Nan (梁南) had one of his poem titled The Time of Return (归来的时刻).  List of Returned Poets  The Returned Poets can be divided into three subgroups. The first subgroup is the Poetry School of July (七月诗派), who were arrested because of the Counter- Revolution Case of Hu Feng (胡风反革命集团案) in 1955. Poets in this subgroup are: Hu Feng (胡风), Liu Banjiu (刘半九), Niu Han (牛汉), Zeng Zhuo (曾卓), Ji Fang (冀汸), Peng Yanjiao (彭燕郊), Lu Li (鲁藜), Luo Luo (罗洛), etc. The second subgroup includes those who were categorized as rightist during the Anti-Rightist Campaign (反右运动) in 1957. They are: Ai Qing (艾青), Gong Liu (公刘), Liu Shahe (流沙河), Liang Nan (梁南), Lin Xi (林希), Zhao Kai (赵恺), Chang Yao (昌耀), Bai Hua (白桦), Shao Yanxiang (邵燕祥), Zhou Liangpei (周良沛), Hu Zhao (胡昭), etc. The last subgroup includes those who were influenced by the western modernism and kept a distance from the proletarian literature. They are: Mu Dan (穆旦), Du Yunxie (杜运夔), Yuan kejia (袁可嘉), Zheng Min (郑敏), Xin Di (辛迪), Chen Jingrong (陈敬容), Tang Qi (唐祈), Tang Shi (唐湜), Hang Yuehe (杭约赫), etc. In addition, Cai Qijiao (蔡其矫), who were politically criticized during the 1950s and the 1960s, is also considered as a returned poet.  Historical Background   Art Characteristics and Works  The first poetic characteristic of the Returned Poets is that their poems were autobiographical, especially at the beginning of this new era, roughly from 1978 to the early 1980s. With the expectation of a new era, they considered their return as both in real social life and cultural world. The narrator, created by Liu Shahe (流沙河) in his Return (归来), represented a very common poetic subject in this period. The long and suffering journey of this return referred to more than 20-year unjustified treatment. This mixing of joy, sentimentality, and proud became the emotional core of their poems.The second characteristic is that their poems were both individual and historical reflection. Returned Poets identified themselves as the witness of history, thus they thought they should be socially and culturally responsible. On one hand, they reflected their individual experience and the historical trauma; on the other hand, they were also critical on a broader level and try to find the historical and social reason for a national tragedy. Returned Poets were always in a tension with the Chinese history, like what Gong Liu (公刘) showed in his poem Reflection (沉思):The theme of \\"reflection on history\\" became a motley face among the Returned Poets. It can be: joyful or sad, love or hate, sticking to the belief or feeling lost to the future, the illusion of poetic hero or the sentimentality of suffering and losing. It is from this demand of new emotional expression that the Returned Poets went into different directions and developed their poetic skills in the new era.  Ai Qing  Ai Qing's reputation was already built in the late 1930s. His emotional articulation on the suffering of Chinese nation was very influential at that time. He wrote more than two hundred poems and published several albums after his return in 1978. Some of them focused on real political issue; some had a grandiose theme concerning the historical experience of Chinese or even human beings; and some were just casual writing. Fish Fossil (鱼化石) was regarded as an autobiography for that period.His poems in the new era showed a continuation of his poetic characteristics: the sympathy for suffering people and the faith in people's revitalization. Ai Qing's poetic characteristics shows the aestheticization of political and ideological struggle, which was generally viewed as the struggle between light and dark during the 1980s. These poems wrote after his returned were limited by his old thoughts and skills, thus didn't provide much new nutrition to contemporary Chinese poetry in the new era.  Chang Yao (昌耀)  Chang Yao was born 1936 and started writing at the early 1950s. He was divided as a rightist and was forced to Laogai (reform through labor) for more than 20 years before his return. Like all other returned poets, he also faced the conflict between the old poetic style and the new aesthetic demand. He didn't just focus on a right-or-wrong judgement on history, but turned to a more transcendental subject: the salvation of life through love. It was very obvious in his poem Ferry of Mercy (慈航).Another noticeable phenomenon in Chang Yao's poem is his pursuit of social justice. In some of his poems, he consciously expressed his critical attitude toward the commodification and inequality in the era of economic reform, and it accidentally echoed with the New Left (新左派) thought in China (although Chang Yao himself didn't know this school of thought at that time), which appeared in the late 1990s and criticize the global capitalism. \\"Ironically, Chang Yao was unjustifiably labeled as a rightist when the left is the dominant ideology; yet he called him a leftist after he returned, in a time when nobody talked about the left any longer.\\"  Criticism  The Returned Poets, along with the younger generation of poets who started writing later than them, such as the so-called Misty Poets, played the major roles for Chinese poetry in the 1980s. They tried to adapt themselves to the new era and the new poetic aesthetics and explored new poetic skills. In general, their contribution to the development of Chinese poetry was \\"positive, although limited.  Notes  References  External links  * 中国诗歌库 An online Chinese poetry website.

Gladsheim is the highest point in the Valhalla Ranges. It is situated in the southern part of Valhalla Provincial Park, northeast of Gimli Peak, and west of Slocan and Slocan Lake. The name \\"Valhalla Mountains\\" first appeared in George Mercer Dawson's Geological Survey of Canada map published in 1890. Dawson applied names derived from Scandinavian mythology to several of the mountain ranges and peaks in Southern Kootenay. Gladsheim is the magnificent meeting hall containing thirteen council seats where, according to Norse mythology, Odin presided over all the realms. In keeping with the Valhalla theme, this peak's name was submitted in 1900 by R. W. Brock to the Geological Survey of Canada for consideration, and it was officially adopted March 31, 1924, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Based on the Köppen climate classification, Gladsheim Peak has a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Gwillim Creek and Mulvey Creek, both tributaries of the Slocan River. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Cooper, to the northeast.

It has smooth, shiny bark, glossy green lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and fifteen, white flowers and hemispherical or conical fruit. It differs from other subspecies of E. pauciflora in having angular flower buds. Description Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. debeuzevillei is a mallee or tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The branchlets are usually glaucous. The bark is smooth, grey, white, cream-coloured or light brown and often has insect scribbles. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish green or glaucous, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped to lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between nine and fifteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are club-shaped to oblong, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in December and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or below it. Subspecies debeuzevillei differs from others in the species in having mature buds that are strongly angular. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus debeuzevillei was first formally described in 1920 by Joseph Maiden in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, from material collected by Wilfred Alexander de Beuzeville. In 1973, Lawrie Johnson and Donald Blaxell reduced the species to a subspecies of E. pauciflora as E. pauciflora subsp. debeuzevillei. The epithet (debeuzevillei) presumably honours the collector of the type.  Distribution and habitat This subspecies occurs on the highest peaks south from Mount Franklin in the Australian Capital Territory to near Yarrangobilly in New South Wales and Mount Buffalo in Victoria.

He most recently competed part-time in the ARCA Menards Series, driving the No. 55 Toyota Camry for Venturini Motorsports and the No. 22 Ford Fusion for Chad Bryant Racing. He has raced in the series for over a decade and also made two NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series starts in 2010 for Germain Racing. In his eight full-time seasons in ARCA, he has finished in the top-10 in points every year, including in the top-5 in five of those eight years. He finished second in the ARCA point standings in 2016, his most recent full-time season in ARCA. Racing career Early career Hessert became the youngest driver to compete in the Rolex 24 when he drove in the event in 2003 at age 16 alongside his father Tom Jr. Both of them shared the No. 68 for The Racer's Group. ARCA career Hessert's No. 52 Ken Schrader Racing ARCA car at the second Pocono race in 2011. Hessert's No. 77 Cunningham Motorsports ARCA car at Road America in 2013. Despite after coming off the heels of a second-place points finish, Hessert decided to only run part-time in 2017 in order to spend more time with his family, but left the door open to returning full-time in the future. He ended up running five races that season, sharing the Venturini No. 25 with Spencer Davis, Raphaël Lessard, Natalie Decker, Tanner Thorson and Christopher Bell. He returned to Venturini for the season-opener at Daytona in 2018, this time in the No. 55 as Decker was driving the No. 25 full-time that year. Hessert's next start and only other of 2018 did not come until the race at IRP, where he drove the No. 22 for Chad Bryant Racing at that race as a replacement for Chase Briscoe, who could not compete after the race was rescheduled a month later than it was supposed to be run due to rain, and the new race date conflicted with his Xfinity schedule. CBR is the successor team to Cunningham Motorsports, who Hessert drove the No. 77 for full-time previously.

The current Mayor is Mario Conte, a member of the right-wing populist party Lega Nord, who took office on 13 June 2018. Overview According to the Italian Constitution, the Mayor of Treviso is member of the City Council. The Mayor is elected by the population of Treviso, who also elects the members of the City Council, controlling the Mayor's policy guidelines and is able to enforce his resignation by a motion of no confidence. The Mayor is entitled to appoint and release the members of his government. Since 1994 the Mayor is elected directly by Treviso's electorate: in all mayoral elections in Italy in cities with a population higher than 15,000 the voters express a direct choice for the mayor or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives at least 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. The election of the City Council is based on a direct choice for the candidate with a preference vote: the candidate with the majority of the preferences is elected. The number of the seats for each party is determined proportionally. Italian Republic (since 1946) City Council election (1946-1994) From 1946 to 1994, the Mayor of Treviso was elected by the City's Council.

It was serialized in Futabasha's Monthly Action magazine from March 2018 to May 2020 and collected into three volumes. Our Colors is Tagame's second manga for general audiences, following his 2014 series My Brother's Husband. Synopsis Sora Itoda, a closeted second-year high school student, is alienated by the homophobia of his peers and the pressures of needing to pass as straight. One day, Sora meets an older man who runs a cafe, and learns that the man is also gay. The series follows the intergenerational friendship that forms between Sora and the man, and the mentorship the man provides Sora on the problems he is facing. Production Series creator Gengoroh Tagame, a manga artist famously known for creating hardcore BDSM gay manga, began creating all-ages material in 2014 with his manga series My Brother's Husband. Tagame has stated that the experience of creating My Brother's Husband made him \\"realize how much fun [all-ages manga] is to draw,\\" saying that balancing the creation of erotic works with the simultaneous creation of all-ages works was \\"very healthy for me, mentally.\\" Our Colors is Tagame's second all-ages work following My Brother's Husband. Tagame stated that the series was inspired by his desire to create a story about gay characters that was not centrally focused on romance or sex; further, he wished to create a story that focused on a gay protagonist, in contrast to the straight protagonist of My Brother's Husband. Release Our Colors was announced in February 2018 by publisher Futabasha in the manga magazine Monthly Action, and began serialization in Monthly Action on March 24, 2018. Its final chapter was published in the July issue of Monthly Action on May 25, 2020. The series has been collected into three volumes published by Futabasha.

Life  He was born in Perticara, Italy on 12 October 1845, but began his musical studies with his uncle Pio Galli in Rimini until 1862 when he enrolled in the Milan Conservatory to be a pupil of Alberto Mazzucato. He would there compose the aria Cesare al Rubicone to be performed in the Teatro Vittorio Emanuel II in Rimini in 1864 and 1865 and after serving in the Italian Army under Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Battle of Bezzecca, graduated with the canata Espiazione. He then moved to Amelia, Umbria where he became bandmaster in the city chapel and director of the town band between 1871 and 1873, as well as director of the Finale Emilia school from 1871 to 1873. In 1869, he began his career as a journalist as well, being art director of Stabilimento Musicale Sonzogno and editor of Edoardo Sonzogno's Euterpe though Sonzongno never credited him. In 1873 he moved to Milan once again to be Chairman of Counterpoint and Musical Aesthetics at the Conservatory of which he studied in, as well as music critic of the newspapers Il Secolo and editors of Il Teatro Illustrata and La Musica Popolare, all of which owned by Sonzogno. In this, he mainly translated French opera librettos and publishing singing and piano sheet music of multiple opera scores. After gaining substantial fame from his composing and journalism, in 1894 he purchased a holiday home in Rimini but in 1906 or 1907 quit journalism, and in 1914 retired completely and moved to Rimini, where he died on December 8, 1919. The Teatro Vittorio Emanuel II, was renamed Teatro Amintore Galli in his name but was bombed in World War Two. The La Sagra Musicale Malatestiana music festival annually honours the theatre, as Rimini had not had a full theatre since.

History 2018 Graf standing next to his No. 77 car at Madison in 2018. The team was formed on January 9, 2018 by ARCA crew chief Chad Bryant, who purchased the assets of the team he had been working for in the series, Cunningham Motorsports, which was being sold by its retiring owner Briggs Cunningham, who was age 85 at the time. His co-owner, 68-year old Kerry Scherer, also decided to step away from team ownership and did not continue with the team after it was sold to Bryant. The team was nearly the same as it was in 2017 before the change in ownership, as Bryant retained all personnel who remained with the team. However, since Cunningham's 2017 drivers Shane Lee and Dalton Sargeant both moved up to the NASCAR Xfinity and Truck Series, respectively, in 2018, Bryant needed new drivers for the team's No. 22 and No. 77 cars. Bo LeMastus signed with the team to run at Daytona in the No. 77, and rookie Joe Graf Jr. joined CBR for what was initially set to be a part-time schedule starting at the second race of the season at Nashville. However, the team later decided to keep him on for the rest of the season. Due to lack of sponsorship and focusing on the transition in ownership, the team did not field the No. 22 at Daytona and they let Fast Track Racing use their owner points to field an additional entry at that race for Ed Pompa. Tyler Dippel drove the No. 22 at Nashville and Josh Berry at Salem. Due to a lack of sponsorship, the team withdrew from Talladega and only ran part-time for the remainder of the season. Dippel made another start in the car at Charlotte and Tom Hessert, who formerly drove the No. 77 full-time for their predecessor Cunningham team, ran at IRP as a replacement for Chase Briscoe, who was scheduled to be in the No. 22 for that race, but could not compete after the race was rescheduled a month later than it was supposed to be run due to rain, and the new race date conflicted with his Xfinity schedule. Graf and Chad Finchum had driven for the team at ARCA's Daytona test in January. Finchum did not end up running any races with the team, and was in the car then to get approval to run at the track in his full-time Xfinity Series ride with MBM Motorsports. Graf would go on to finish eighth in points in his first full- season in ARCA (minus one race), picking up one win at Berlin Raceway on August 25, 2018. He almost scored his first win at Talladega earlier that year, but lost to the No. 41 MDM Motorsports Toyota driven by Zane Smith in a photo finish at the line. 2019 Corey Heim was one of three drivers of the No. 22 for the team in 2019. In their second season as a team, Graf returned to the CBR No. 77 car full-time. The team was able to run the No. 22 car full-time again. That car would have a rotation of drivers during the season, with Connor Hall starting the season at Daytona with sponsorship from Marlow Yachts. Following that, CARS Super Late Model Tour driver Corey Heim began his slate of races in the No. 22. The team signed him in October 2018 to run the short track races. Crew chief Paul Andrews switched teams from Graf's No. 77 to the No. 22 for 2019, with Graf now having team owner Bryant as his crew chief. In the remaining races where Heim was not eligible to run, Ty Majeski, a Ford development driver who had previously competed for Roush Fenway Racing's NASCAR Xfinity Series team, which closed down after 2018, drove the team's No. 22 in six races. He returned to ARCA for the first time in two years, and doing so this time in an effort to rebuild his career after losing his ride. In dominant fashion, Majeski finished in the top-5 in every single one of his starts, which included three wins, which came at Charlotte, Pocono, and Chicago. In his other three races, he finished once in second (at Michigan, third (at Kansas), and fourth (at Nashville). His very strong performances led him to secure a full-time ride in 2020 in the Truck Series driving the No. 45 Chevrolet for Niece Motorsports, meaning he will leave Ford and CBR. (Before he signed this deal, he ran one race for them in 2019 at Phoenix.) In addition, Chad Bryant Racing made their debut in the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West (which was soon to be renamed the ARCA Menards Series West), fielding two cars in the series' season-finale at Phoenix in preparation for when ARCA would visit the track for the first time in 2020. Majeski was entered in the No. 2 and Heim in the No. 22. It was both drivers' debuts in the West Series.

In 1966, Wynette signed a recording contract with Epic Records. The following year, her debut studio album entitled Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad was issued, peaking at number 7 on the Billboard Country Albums chart. The same year, she collaborated with David Houston on the studio album My Elusive Dreams, which reached number 11 on the same chart. The following year, her fourth studio album D-I-V-O-R-C-E peaked at number 1 on the Country Albums list, spending two weeks at the top spot. Wynette's fifth studio record Stand by Your Man (1969) reached number 2 on the country albums chart and peaked at number 43 on the Billboard 200 albums list. Wynette's first compilation released entitled Tammy's Greatest Hits (1969) would spend 61 weeks on the Billboard 200 before peaking at number 37. Into the 1970s, Wynette released several studio albums per year. Reaching the top ten on the Top Country Albums chart during this time included Tammy's Touch (1970), The Ways to Love a Man (1970) and My Man (1972). After several more studio releases, her 1976 albums, 'Til I Can Make It on My Own and You and Me, reached the top five of the Country Albums chart. Wynette issued four more studio albums before the end of decade, including One of a Kind (1977) and Just Tammy (1979). By the 1980s, Wynette's commercial success began to decline. Her highest-charting studio releases peaked within top forty positions on the Country Albums chart: Only Lonely Sometimes (1980), Soft Touch (1982) and Sometimes When We Touch (1985). Her 1987 studio album Higher Ground was critically acclaimed and featured collaborations with various music artists. In 1993, Wynette collaborated with Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette on the studio release Honky Tonk Angels. The album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America for exceeding 500,000 units. Her final studio album was 1994's Without Walls, which featured collaborations with Sting and Elton John.

This directive aims to improve the trade between members of the EU for accessible products and services, by removing country specific rules. Businesses benefits from having a common set of rules within the EU, which should facilitate easier cross- border trade. It should also allow a greater market for companies providing accessible products and services. Persons with disabilities and elderly people will benefit from having more accessible products and services in the market. An increased market size should produce more competitive prices. There should be fewer barriers within the EU & more job opportunities as well. This act was built to complement the EU's Web Accessibility Directive which became law in 2016. It also is reflecting the obligations of the UN's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It includes a wide range of systems including personal devices such as computers, smartphones, e-books, and TVs, as well as public services like television broadcast, ATMs, ticketing machines, public transport services, banking services and e-commerce sites. The laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive have to be adopted and published by the Member States by 28 June 2022. Three years later, in 2025, the requirements of the European accessibility act must already have been implemented. The requirements and obligations of this Directive do not apply to microenterprises providing services within the scope of this Directive – whereby ‘microenterprise’ means an enterprise which employs fewer than 10 persons and which has an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 2 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 2 million.

Background A UFC Middleweight Championship bout between the current champion Israel Adesanya and former interim title challenger (as well as 2000 Olympic silver medalist and former world champion in freestyle wrestling) Yoel Romero headlined the event. A UFC Women's Strawweight Championship bout between the current champion Zhang Weili and former champion Joanna Jędrzejczyk took place as the co-main event. A middleweight bout between former champion Robert Whittaker (also The Ultimate Fighter: The Smashes welterweight winner) and Jared Cannonier was expected to take place at this event. However, it was announced on January 15 that Whittaker pulled out of the bout. Subsequently, promotion officials announced that Cannonier would be on standby in the event that one of the main event participants were to pull out of that contest. In turn, Cannonier indicated in mid-February that he had suffered a torn pectoral injury while training and would be sidelined for several months. A bantamweight bout between Sean O'Malley and The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America bantamweight winner José Alberto Quiñónez was originally scheduled to take place at UFC 229. However, it was scrapped after O'Malley failed a United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) drug test. The bout was then expected to take place at UFC 247, but it was eventually moved to this event for unknown reasons. While not officially announced by the organization, a featherweight bout between Calvin Kattar and Jeremy Stephens was expected to take place at the event. However, Stephens was removed from the card in mid-January with an injury. The pairing was left intact and rescheduled for UFC 249. A featherweight bout between Douglas Silva de Andrade and Movsar Evloev was scheduled to take place at the event. However, de Andrade withdrew from the bout due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Jamall Emmers. Subsequently, Evloev pulled out of the fight in late February citing injuries sustained in a road accident. He was replaced by Giga Chikadze. A middleweight bout between Derek Brunson and Edmen Shahbazyan was scheduled to take place at the event. However, it was announced on February 20 that the bout had moved to UFC Fight Night: Overeem vs. Harris. At the weigh- ins, Emily Whitmire weighed in at 117.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds over the strawweight non-title fight limit of 116 pounds. She was fined 20% of her purse and her bout with Polyana Viana was expected to proceed as scheduled at a catchweight. However, Whitmire was hospitalized the day of the event and the fight was cancelled.

Small and enveloped, MODV contains positive single-stranded RNA. Taxonomically, MODV is part of the Flavivirus genus and Flaviviridae family . The Flavivirus genus includes nearly 80 viruses, both vector-borne and no known vector (NKV) species. Known flavivirus vector-borne viruses include Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus. In 1958, MODV was first isolated from the mammary gland tissue of a white-footed deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) captured in Modoc County, California. Since the first isolation, the MODV has also been isolated from deer mice in Oregon, Colorado, and Montana. There are other anti-genetically and genetically related viruses which also have no known vector such as Jutiapa virus, the Cowbone Ridge virus, the Sal Vieja virus, and the San Perlita virus. Little information is known about these viruses as well.  Structure  The MODV virus has a particle size of about 45 nm which is comparable with other flaviviruses particles that are about 40-60 nm in diameter. A mature flavivirus has a spherical shape and contains multiple copies of three structural proteins (C, M, and E), a host-derived membrane bilayer, and a single copy of a positive- sense RNA genome of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. The first structure of a flavivirus, the Dengue virus, was determined by using cryo-electron microscopy and an electron density map fitted with the known structure of glycoprotein E (Fig.1). Figure 1. Dengue virus three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction  Genome  Flaviviruses have positive (+) ssRNA genomes about 11kb in size. The MODV genome is 10,600 nucleotides in length with a single open reading frame extending from nucleotides 110 to 10,234, encoding 3374 amino acids. The ORF has the gene order C-prM-E- NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 which is consistent with mosquito- and tick- borne flaviviruses (Fig.2). Figure 2. Flavivirus genome organization  Replication cycle  Similar to most positive (+) ssRNA viruses, flaviviruses generate organelle-like structures in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host organism for replication. Since the ER is involved in de novo biogenesis of some cell organelles, viruses take advantage of the replication location to take over some of the organelle functions for its own replication cycle. Viral genome replication in the ER occurs in structures called virus replication organelles. The organelles include two distinct subdomains, vesicle packets (VP) and convoluted membranes (CMs). The site of viral genome replication is found within the vesicle packets which are clusters of small vesicle compartments. The function of CMs is relatively unknown, but they are described as electron-dense amorphous structures near the VPs. The large single polypeptide encoded by the genome is processed in the ER membrane by host or viral proteases. The large polypeptide is divided into three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and E) and a group of non-structural proteins (NS1-NS5). The viral genomic RNA forms a nucleocapsid complex with the capsid protein which aids in genome packaging into mature virus particles. The prM and E proteins are considered significant components of the virus particle and can even form spherical virus particles. The exact functions of NS proteins are relatively unknown, however, they are assumed to play a role in the formation of virus particle replication organelles. The NS1 protein has a large ectodomain which is believed to function in the deformation of the ER membrane from the luminal side. NS2B protein, a transmembrane protein, directly interacts with NS3 which is a soluble protein anchored to the membrane. With its protease activity and RNA helicase activity, the NS3 protein is involved in viral polyprotein processing and viral RNA replication. NS5 plays a role in the replication of the viral genomic RNA and the formation of the 5’-cap structure for protein translation with its RNA dependent and RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and methyltransferase activity. The 5′-end possesses a type I cap (m7GpppAmp) that is not seen in viruses of the other genera. Proteins N2SA, NS4A, and NS4B are membrane-integrated proteins but have no clear function.  Life cycle  Schematic model of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses  Entry into cell  To enter the cell, MODV virus is assumed to invade the cell via steps similar to the Flavivirus family. Through endocytosis, the virus enters the host cell and then releases its positive (+) ssRNA genome into the cytoplasm through membrane fusion.  Replication and transcription  The MDOV genome codes for a single ORF, which is processed by both cellular and viral proteases to form three structural proteins and at least seven non-structural proteins. On either side of the ORF, untranslated regions (UTRs) are present and fold into complex stem-loop structures required for replication. The 5’ UTR consists of 109 nucleotides and the 3’ UTR consists of 366 nucleotides. Comparing MODV to 20 other flaviviruses, several regions with high sequence similarity appeared. The regions corresponded to functionally important domains and conserved sites for proteolytic cleavage by viral and cellular proteases. MDOV transcription proceeds according to the positive (+) RNA strand model.  Assembly and release  The rough endoplasmic reticulum is believed to be the site of viral assembly. Following genome replication, the newly synthesized RNA interacts with the capsid and buds into the ER lumen along with immature prM and E proteins which undergo maturation in the Golgi and endosomes. For instance, the prM protein is cleaved by furin or a furin- like cellular protease to generate mature virions. The virion moves through the cytoplasm until it is released from the cell via exocytosis.  Transmission and tropism  Since no vector has been identified for MODV, the exact mode transmission is not known. However, the studied field strain of MODV showed persistent infection of the virus in deer mouse lungs that may be transmitted horizontally through close, prolonged contact of infected and susceptible individuals. Direct contact (i.e., salivary secretions) or indirect contact (i.e., fomites, aerosols and urine) may enable viral spread. Rodent nests during the winter provide conditions suitable for the horizontal transmission of viruses. In addition, transmission presumably occurs horizontally since attempts to infect ticks and mosquitoes as cultured cell lines or in vivo have been unsuccessful. Other studies suggest cannibalism does not play a role in viral transmission, but the possibility of sexual transmission has yet to be explored. The molecular determinants of transmission are unknown, but comparison of the conserved sequence differences between the two groups suggests vector-borne conserved pentanucleotide sequence (CPS) nor variable region (VR) of the conserved sequences are required for vector-borne transmission. A transient viremia in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) produced a measurable production of antibody titers and showed persistence in the lungs. While deer mice are accepted as the main host organism, the presence of antibodies in chipmunks (Tamias minimus) and red squirrels (Tamias-ciurus hudsonicus) suggests the virus has multiple hosts. Virus transmission in chipmunks and red squirrels was more successful than in deer mice, which may be due to a difference in viral shedding under experimental conditions and field conditions. Field conditions may cause more stress due to cold temperatures and food shortages.  Associated diseases  Modoc virus antigen in spinal cord and brain A rodent-associated virus, MODV has the potential to cause disease in humans similar to other flaviviruses. It was determined that MODV was the responsible virus for a case of aseptic meningitis when the virus was first discovered in California. Typically, flaviviruses cause encephalitis in host organisms. MODV causes flavivirus-like encephalitis in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice and in hamsters with histopathological features reminiscent of flavivirus encephalitis in man.. Studies suggest envelope (E) proteins encoded for by the genome may play a dominant role as a determinant of flavivirus neurovirulence. A single amino acid substitution was shown to cause major effects on neurovirulence. The mechanisms and determinants involved in Flavivirus neuroinvasiveness remains unknown. However, evidence suggests neuroinvasiveness depends entirely on envelope proteins E and prM (pre-membrane) In a study investigating the effects of MODV on hamsters, severe encephalitis, bilateral hindlimb paralysis, and complete paralysis with an intact corneal reflex were observed.. MODV-induced encephalitis in hamsters was characterized by movement of monocytes and lymphocytes into the cortex and bulbus olfactorius, causing massive destruction of the tissue structure. In all surviving hamsters, IgM and HI antibodies to MODV were present in the blood after subcutaneous infection. Of all infected hamsters, no substantial microscopic lesions were observed in the liver, spleen, lung, and heart. However, rare focal portal inflammation of the liver and mild reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the spleen were noted. Considerable pathological changes were observed in the brain and spinal cord during early infection. During early infection, the lesions in the spinal cord were more severe than those observed in the brain. In immunocompetent mice, MODV causes 100% morbidity and mortality when the virus was inoculated directly into the brain. Alternatively, when inoculated via the intranasal route, 50% morbidity and mortality was observed Infectious MODV was also isolated from kidney tissue for at least eight months after infection, specifically the epithelium of the renal tubules.. Despite the presence of antibodies, infected hamsters continued to shed viruses in the urine for up to four months. Due to viral shedding in the urine, there is the potential use of urinalysis to monitor the effectiveness of therapy on viral replication by monitoring the viral RNA in the urine using quantitative RT-PCR assays References Category:Flaviviruses ","title":"Modoc virus"},{"id":"62579272","text":"The Keystone Community Church, on McGinley St. in Keystone, Nebraska, was built in 1908.

During his career he practiced both nationally and internationally, had a distinguished career in public service, and received numerous honors and awards. Early life and education Rockrise was born in New York City to Iwahiko Tsumanuma (also known as Thomas S. Rockrise, one of the first American-educated Japanese architects in the United States) and Agnes Margaret (Asbury) Rockrise, of Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in New York City and later at Saranac Lake, New York, where his father was under treatment for tuberculosis. In high school he was an Eagle Scout and built and operated his own ham radio. Rockrise received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from his father's alma mater, Syracuse University in 1938. At that time, the program at Syracuse taught the Beaux Arts method of classical design. While attending Syracuse, Rockrise received several scholarships. Of note was a Flight Training Scholarship from the U.S. Army Air Corps his senior year, leading him to receive his pilot's license upon graduation. After working a few years in architecture and construction, Rockrise was awarded concurrently a Graduate Fellowship at Columbia University and an Advanced Flight Scholarship from the U.S. Army Air Corps for advanced flight training. With war on the world's horizon, Rockrise made what he considered to be a difficult decision. He chose to decline the Advanced Flight Scholarship, instead to attend Columbia University, where he received his M.S. in Architecture in 1941. Career Upon graduating from Columbia University, Rockrise accepted a job in the Canal Zone of Panama, where he was residing when the U.S. entered World War II, December 7, 1941. Rockrise remained in Panama for the duration of the war, working as an architect for the Canal Zone, U.S. Navy, the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the Caribbean Defense Command at various times. He also established a private architectural practice in Panama City. Rockrise was never able to fulfill his desire to fly for the U.S. Navy, as he was repeatedly denied a commission because of his Japanese ancestry. Returning to New York City after the war, Rockrise went to work for Edward D. Stone, FAIA (’58), who at this time was one of the leading American architects exploring modernism. Rockrise worked on various projects including the El Panama Hotel (Panama City, Panama), coordinating the firm’s work with Thomas D. Church, FASLA, in San Francisco, then the country’s leading modern landscape architect. As Rockrise stated, “I was chosen to go to San Francisco—and I think this was really the turning point—to coordinate the architectural drawings with Tommy’s landscape drawings. Perhaps this was because they had to be done in the metric system, and perhaps because the notes had to be in Spanish, and I spoke Spanish.” Subsequently, Rockrise worked for the architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm, Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM), where he was assigned by SOM architect and design partner Gordon Bunshaft, FAIA, to be a staff designer for the United Nations Headquarters Building. As one of the ‘Backroom Boys,’ Rockrise worked under Sven Markelius and Le Corbusier, two of the group of world-renowned architects who designed the United Nations complex. Carpenter Residence, Medford, Oregon In 1947, Rockrise was invited to become an associate in the landscape architecture office of Thomas D. Church in California. Church is the recognized pioneer in the modernist mid-century landscape style of the day. Among other projects, Rockrise worked with then associate, Lawrence Halprin, FASLA (’69), on the award winning design for the landscaping of the Donnell residence in Sonoma County, California. Rockrise was responsible for the design of the bath house and lanai. The 1948 garden is “famous for its unusual abstracted forms” and is considered a “Modernist icon.” The U.S. Consulate Office Building, Fukuoka, Japan In these early years, 1949–1953, Rockrise also taught at the School of Architecture at the University of California at Berkeley, and was the faculty advisor for the student chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA). He was also a member of Telesis.Telesis, \\"The Next Million People (regional planning for),\\" Telesis, September 1950, SPUR Archives. ROMA partners James Amis, Robert Mountjoy, George Rockrise, and Robert Odermatt In 1950, Rockrise established his own practice in San Francisco. Among the first draftsmen he hired were John Matthew Myers and Robert C. Mountjoy in 1955, who became associates in 1958. Mountjoy's wife, Jan, a former ‘star’E-mail from Jan and Robert Mountjoy to Christina Rockrise, July 29, 2019. architecture student of Rockrise's at Berkeley, came on as secretary/draftsman.Jan Mountjoy's architectural education was interrupted in 1954 when she followed her husband, then a lieutenant in the Navy, to Adak Island, Alaska, where he was stationed as Naval Utilities Officer. She left the office in 1958 to start a family but returned in the 1970s to work for the firm in various capacities through the years until both she and her husband retired in 1982. E-mail from Jan and Robert Mountjoy to Christina Rockrise, July 29, 2019. Rockrise's early practice was focused on the design of award- winning residential projects, including: *Perlman Residence (Squaw Valley, CA 1956), Merit Award, Progressive Architecture Magazine *Carpenter Residence (Medford, OR, 1955), National Award of Merit, A.I.A. *Matzinger Residence (Belvedere, CA 1961).Rockrise and Watson, A.I.A. brochure, approximately 1960.

His work always showed a Japanese sensitivity to materials and the environment -- a real sensitivity on how to use wood, how to use stone, and how to integrate buildings into the natural site,\\" said Jim Chappell, Assoc. AIA, past president of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR). Chappell was president of SPUR from 1994-2009. In 1954, he was invited to Venezuela for several months to assist renowned Venezuelan architect Tomás José Sanabria in the establishment of that country's first school of architecture at the Universidad Nacional. Rockrise also served as a visiting professor and curriculum consultant at the school. In 1957, Rockrise was commissioned to design the American Consulate in Fukuoka, Japan, in collaboration with the noted architects Hervey Parke Clark, FAIA, and John Beuttler. The job took him to Japan for the first time in the later part of that year and, for the first time, he was able to visit the birthplace of his father (Yamagata City) and meet many of his Japanese relatives, among them, his last living aunt. Rockrise entered into partnership with William J. Watson in 1960, forming the firm, Rockrise and Watson A.I.A. Rockrise and Watson dissolved in 1968. In 1962, Rockrise collaborated with Lawrence Livingston, Jr. and Lawrence Halprin to produce the study, “What to do About Market Street.” It remains the seminal study for the rehabilitation of lower Market Street in San Francisco,San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, \\"What To Do About Market Street,\\" San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR), December 11, 1962. resulting in the complete rebuilding of the street during the period 1966-1980. In 1968, Rockrise formed George T. Rockrise and Associates, with Robert A. Odermatt, FAIA (‘86), Robert C. Mountjoy and James J. Amis, FAIA (‘97), all of whom were associates, becoming principals. The firm later became Rockrise, Odermatt, Mountjoy and Amis (ROMA), and is known today as ROMA Design Group, though none of the original named partners are any longer associated with the firm. “Perhaps more than any single achievement, George should be commended for advancing an interdisciplinary approach to design…. [His] active involvement in architecture, landscape architecture and planning became reflected in the development of ROMA, which evolved into one of the earliest truly interdisciplinary offices, advocating a team approach to design.\\"Letter October 15, 1985, from ROMA Design Group partners Robert A. Odermatt and Boris Dramov to \\"Friends and Colleagues\\" on the occasion of Rockrise's retirement from the firm. According to Mountjoy, “I think the interdisciplinary approach to design was always a part of our practice. Even with residential work there was always collaboration with consultants for structural, mechanical, electrical, landscaping input. Later, in urban design and planning, there were close ties to environmental, transportation, economic and social disciplines.”E-mail to Christina Rockrise, August 12, 2019. Odermatt commented, “George Rockrise was a strong believer in a collaborative approach to urban planning and architecture design. Under his leadership, members of collateral design professions such as landscape architecture, structural and mechanical/electrical engineering were engaged as team members early on in the design process. This collaborative approach ensured that the various design disciplines had the opportunity to contribute their knowledge and expertise at the earliest stages of the development of the project’s design concept.”E-mail to Christina Rockrise, August 4, 2019. Rockrise retired from ROMA in 1986. He established a solo practice based in Glen Ellen, CA, completing the Wellington Residence & Winery (Glen Ellen, CA), the Paradise Ridge Winery (Santa Rosa, CA), the Sternik Residence (St. Helena, CA), and the Rockrise/Brown residence (Camano Island, WA). Personal life In 1948 Rockrise married Margaret (Maggie) Lund Paulson, originally from Oregon and a Stanford graduate, who was the fashion editor of a San Francisco newspaper. In the early 1950s they had two children, Christina Margaret and Peter Lund. Maggie passed away prematurely in 1957. In 1959 Rockrise married Sally Scott Griffin, with whom he had a daughter, Celia Asbury. The marriage ended in divorce in 1964. In 1988, Rockrise married Anneliese Warner, originally from Garmisch, Germany, who worked for the American Consulate in Munich, Germany. They met while Rockrise was on assignment for the US State Department there in Munich. They purchased a home in Glen Ellen, California, moving there after an extensive remodel.

Service with the American Institute of Architects (AIA) included Northern California Chapter Vice-President (1960) and President (1961), Director of the California Council (1961), National Vice President (1969-1972), Chair of the Task Force on Social Responsibility, Trustee for the Urban Design and Development Corporation, and several design juries. As a licensed landscape architect, Rockrise was also a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) and received the Distinguished Service Citation for Contributions to the Environment in 1967. He was also licensed as a professional planner, and as a charter member of the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP) served as chair of the Urban Design Committee. Rockrise was known for his distinguished public service and as a teacher and lecturer in Architecture, Urban Design and related social issues affecting the design professions. In addition to his early teaching at the University of California, Rockrise guest lectured, taught or spoke widely at, among others, the Universidad Nacional, Escuela de Arquitectura y Urbanismo (Caracas, Venezuela), University of Pennsylvania, Stevens Institute of Technology (Hoboken, NJ), Ministerio de Obras Publicas (Madrid, Spain), Agency for International Development (AID), Colegio de Ingenieros de Honduras (Teguicigalapa, Honduras), University of Oregon, Tuskegee Institute, Ecole Americain (Fontainbleau, France), British Universities of Bristol, Sheffield and Aberystwth, XVI Congreso Panamericano de Architectos (Caracas, Venezuela), Universidad Central (Mexico). He was a visiting lecturer (1962-1963) in planning and urban design at Stanford University. While serving as National Vice President for the AIA (1969–1972), Rockrise chaired a task force that secured a $1 million Ford Foundation grant for scholarships for African American students to attend architectural schools and innovated the concept of ‘urban design workshops,’ that would later come to be called Community Design Centers (CDC), where students gained practical professional experience. An outgrowth of this work was his appointment as chair of the Technical Assistance Team of the Southwest Council of La Raza to work with the Ford Foundation in securing grants for housing assistance for Chicano barrios (communities) in the southwest. In 1966, Rockrise was appointed by Robert Weaver, Secretary of the newly formed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to be the first Special Advisor for Design during President Johnson's Great Society initiative. Rockrise also served on the Reynolds Community Architecture Jury (1969), a distinguished group that visited, evaluated and recognized the best new towns worldwide, including Brasilia (Brazil) and Chandigarh (India). Rockrise served as a consultant to the U.S. State Department to evaluate and masterplan for diplomatic missions particularly regarding antiterrorism. Rockrise evaluated United States diplomatic facilities in Germany, Brazil, Venezuela and Dhahran (Saudi Arabia) . Other public service included terms on the San Francisco Art Commission (1953–1956, 1986–1987), the San Francisco Planning Commission (1961–1962), and the Executive Committee, Board of Directors, and Advisory Council of SPUR (San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association).E-mail to Christina Rockrise, December 16, 2019. Rockrise received a Senior Fulbright Fellowship in 1978 and 1979 and was attached to the University of Rome, Italy. During his career he also received two NEA (National Endowment for the Arts) grants. In 1995, he received his last award from San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) which honored him “for his dedication to enhancing the quality of life and economic vitality” in San Francisco.”  References  Further reading * Randl, Chad.

It is a mark that indicates the acetylation at the 8th lysine residue of the histone H4 protein. This mark has been implicated in the prevalence of malaria. Nomenclature H4K8ac indicates acetylation of lysine 8 on histone H4 protein subunit: {  -  Abbr.  Meaning - H4  H4 family of histones -  K  standard abbreviation for lysine -  8  position of amino acid residue (counting from N-terminus) -  ac acetyl group - } Histone modifications The genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells is wrapped around special protein molecules known as histones. The complexes formed by the looping of the DNA are known as chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: this consists of the core octamer of histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) as well as a linker histone and about 180 base pairs of DNA. These core histones are rich in lysine and arginine residues. The carboxyl (C) terminal end of these histones contribute to histone-histone interactions, as well as histone-DNA interactions. The amino (N) terminal charged tails are the site of the post-translational modifications, such as the one seen in H3K36me3. H4 histone H4 modifications are not as well known as H3's and H4 have fewer variations which might explain their important function. H4K8ac  H4K8ac is part of 17 modifications of a group of active promoters. H4K8ac is found more often in active promoters and transcribed regions than other marks. H4K8ac is modified by a different group of enzymes than other H4 lysines.  Lysine acetylation and deacetylation  Lysine acetylation Proteins are typically acetylated on lysine residues and this reaction relies on acetyl- coenzyme A as the acetyl group donor. In histone acetylation and deacetylation, histone proteins are acetylated and deacetylated on lysine residues in the N-terminal tail as part of gene regulation. Typically, these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, although HATs and HDACs can modify the acetylation status of non-histone proteins as well. The regulation of transcription factors, effector proteins, molecular chaperones, and cytoskeletal proteins by acetylation and deacetylation is a significant post- translational regulatory mechanism These regulatory mechanisms are analogous to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by the action of kinases and phosphatases. Not only can the acetylation state of a protein modify its activity, but this post-translational modification may also crosstalk with phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and others for dynamic control of cellular signaling.  Epigenetic implications  The post- translational modification of histone tails by either histone modifying complexes or chromatin remodeling complexes are interpreted by the cell and lead to complex, combinatorial transcriptional output. It is thought that a histone code dictates the expression of genes by a complex interaction between the histones in a particular region. The current understanding and interpretation of histones comes from two large scale projects: ENCODE and the Epigenomic roadmap. The purpose of the epigenomic study was to investigate epigenetic changes across the entire genome. This led to chromatin states which define genomic regions by grouping the interactions of different proteins and/or histone modifications together. Chromatin states were investigated in Drosophila cells by looking at the binding location of proteins in the genome. Use of ChIP-sequencing revealed regions in the genome characterised by different banding. Different developmental stages were profiled in Drosophila as well, an emphasis was placed on histone modification relevance. A look in to the data obtained led to the definition of chromatin states based on histone modifications. The human genome was annotated with chromatin states. These annotated states can be used as new ways to annotate a genome independently of the underlying genome sequence. This independence from the DNA sequence enforces the epigenetic nature of histone modifications. Chromatin states are also useful in identifying regulatory elements that have no defined sequence, such as enhancers. This additional level of annotation allows for a deeper understanding of cell specific gene regulation. Methods The histone mark acetylation can be detected in a variety of ways: 1\\\\. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-sequencing) measures the amount of DNA enrichment once bound to a targeted protein and immunoprecipitated. It results in good optimization and is used in vivo to reveal DNA-protein binding occurring in cells. ChIP-Seq can be used to identify and quantify various DNA fragments for different histone modifications along a genomic region. 2\\\\. Micrococcal Nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) is used to investigate regions that are bound by well positioned nucleosomes. Use of the micrococcal nuclease enzyme is employed to identify nucleosome positioning. Well positioned nucleosomes are seen to have enrichment of sequences. 3\\\\. Assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is used to look in to regions that are nucleosome free (open chromatin). It uses hyperactive Tn5 transposon to highlight nucleosome localisation. Clinical significance This mark has been implicated in the prevalence of malaria.

Following her education at the Academy of Design and Arts KSADA in Kharkiv, Nesheva moved to Kyiv, where she experienced a rampant growth as a painter. In the subsequent years since her premiere in 2010, Nesheva hosted 6 solo exhibitions and created over 50 paintings. Her paintings are displayed to this day in private galleries of Ukraine, in the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami as well as in private collections. In 2014, despite of being one of the most prominent Ukrainian painters of her time, Nesheva started a career of a tattoo artist. In 2017, she opened her tattoo studio \\"Nesheva Art Room\\" in Kyiv. Nesheva is consistently cited as one of the best and sought-after minimalist tattoo artist of Ukraine, known for her long branches tattoos and floral style. Nesheva's clientele includes some of the most famous Ukrainian artists, such as Nadya Dorofeeva, Evgeny Filatov, Nata Zhizhchenko and Irina Gorovaya. Within the last years, Nesheva has broadened her artistic reach, expanding her work in the areas of fashion and graphic design.  Early life  Ulyana Nesheva was born on 26 November 1983, in Kerch. She was the second child in the family. Her elder sister, Kseniya Mikhaylova is a professional translator. She is of Ossetian, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. Her mother, Tatiana Kumaritova, who is an antiquarian, was born in Novosibirsk, Russia, and her father, Akhsarbek Kumaritov, who is a sailor on tanker, was born in the village of Kohat, South Ossetia. Her parents got married in April 1981 and stayed in Kerch. Her grandmother, Angelina Volozhnina, instilled a love for art in her young granddaughter by taking her to art museums in Dresden, where Nesheva got inspired by Raphael masterpiece the Sistine Madonna. In 1990, she enrolled in the Roman Serdiuk's School of Fine arts. Nesheva showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. Her teachers, including artist Victor Zaporozhec, noticed her artistic abilities, and mother encouraged her talent and any creative endeavors. In May 1998, at the age of fifteen, Nesheva graduated as an external student from Zhelyabov High school in Kerch. In 1999, Nesheva started taking private classes from Ukrainian academic artist Tatyana Dydnik. In 2000, Nesheva moved to Kharkov, where she enrolled to Academy of Design and Arts KSADA. At age 16, Nesheva set off for the first time on her own; as she stated: \\"First thing I did was buying a canvas and a couple of oil paints tubes, and that was the moment when I've found my direction as an artist. Since then, I only work with oil painting, as acrylic paint same as gouache, doesn't have an inner strength in it for me.\\" At the same time, she became interested in film photography and graphic arts; she continued mastering her skills as an artist by extensively producing many illustrations, lithographs and conceptual photography series.  Career   Painting  Nesheva began her artist career in the early 20s, exploring a variety of painting techniques and creating graphic arts primarily for local publications. Eventually, she developed a style that combined absolute isolation, \\"conservation\\" of meanings, crazy play of color pallette, photographic accuracy, which still does not cross the line of photorealism and the ability to let the viewer in. Her breakthrough as an artist, Nesheva did in June 2010, when she won the first place in Kyiv Art Week; the same year she displayed her work at Berlin Art Week. In the subsequent years since her debut, Nesheva has taken an increasingly experimental approach in her stylistic shifts. Within the six years period, from 2010 to 2016, Nesheva had six personal exhibitions and created over 50 paintings. Her approach to artwork is consistently rich, nuanced and thought- provoking. To this day, Nesheva's artwork can be found at Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami and mostly in the private collections. In March 2015, Nesheva created illustrations for the book of poetry \\"Island Being\\" by Artash Adriasov. Despite of being a versatile artist, Nesheva recalls painting as her favorite form of art: \\"The painting is like a mirror. You will never see in the reflection of what you do not have inside. Tattoos die with people, but paintings will live forever.\\"  Tattoo art  In 2014, despite her success as a painter, Nesheva decided to try herself in the other shape of art, as she stated: \\"Once I felt the need for a new way of self-realization, and I decided to dive into Tattoo art. As a result, intriguing acquaintance grew into love of life. For me, tattooing is primarily art, and when art is transformed into an integral part of the personality, it causes delight.\\" She got her first tattoo of a cat on the shoulder at 16, in the unknown studio in Kerch. However, Nesheva's interest in Tattoo art raised to the new level, when her friend, Andrei Bezpamyatny, who is a realism tattoo artist, showed her how to use the machine. It took her two days to learn and she mastered her skills by making her first tattoo on herself, of two-headed girl in a dress, which represents a close connection with her sister. Many celebrities have tattoos done by Nesheva: Nadya Dorofeeva, Evgeny Filatov, Nata Zhizhchenko. She is known for her own unique minimalist style with the finest lines and a laconic plot, as she said: \\"I started working in minimalism intuitively, just smoothly moved from graphics to what is close to me. Minimalism is the purity of lines, laconicism, restraint and elegance. The peculiarity of such tattoos is that they become a harmonious addition to the graceful lines of the body with its skin color, all these moles and bones.\\" For a long time, a sprig of lavender became a brand mark of her tattoo style. As Nesheva stated: \\"My popularity came with a tattoo of the long branch for one of my clients. At that time, such sketches were not considered by anyone as a tattoo at all. But that was the moment, which precisely defined my style. Now you can find a lot of similar tattoos and every time I see them, I feel proud to be the first.\\" Being renowned as one of the pioneers in floral and minimalist style, Nesheva is considered to be one of the best tattoo artists of Ukraine. On 4 February 2017, Nesheva opened her own tattoo studio \\"Nesheva Art Room\\" in Kyiv. In November 2019, she became a member of the National Tattoo Association of Ukraine and a judge in the first online tattoo festival in Ukraine.  Fashion  Nesheva built a repertoire in the fashion business as well. In 2012, Nesheva made clear her interest to work in the clothing design industry, as she stated: \\"It was always difficult for me to find simple clothes that would not distract from my face. Therefore, I've decided to create my own brand: things so simple that they could be called clothing sketches, but I was solo involved in design and visual part.\\" She launched the clothing line \\"NESHEVA Sketch Clothing\\" with her friend, Valeriya, however, the partnership ended six months later, but Nesheva's involvement in the fashion world was not over. In 2015, Nesheva collaborated with Ukrainian label TTSWTRS, as the baseline for each new collection of brand was works of acclaimed tattoo artists from all over the world. She created sensual minimalist drawings to combine with the clothes organically, as brand preserves clothing as a second skin and tattoos as the only true way to decorate it, which demonstrates self- expression and freedom in the collections. In 2017, Nike had released a white collection which consisted of brand's main hits – from the dream of all Nike Air Max 90 mods to those designed specifically for Nike Cortez athletes, where Nesheva was a model to represent Air Force 1. In 2018, Nesheva was invited to take a part in the collaboration project of Puma and Buro 24/7. On 14 July 2019, Nesheva collaborated with the Ukrainian jewelry brand Côte & Jeunot and launched the capsule collection of accent pendants and earrings. Her illustrations were transformed into gold and silver pieces with a commitment to exceptional craftsmanship.  Artistry  Nesheva's transition from being an unknown painter to becoming a prosperous artist took place in a short space of time. In 2008, she moved to Kyiv and started working on her first big art piece. In June 2010, Nesheva participated in Kyiv Art Week, an international art week of contemporary art fair, where she was noticed by various critics and curators. Her breakthrough as an artist, Nesheva made in 2010, when her painting \\"Blue Blood\\" took the first place and traveled to Berlin Art Week. In particular Leonora Yanko, a Ukrainian gallerist, was impressed by her work and invited Nesheva to have her first solo exhibition, that opened in May 2011 at Hudgraf Art Gallery, Kyiv. In 2011, Nesheva presented her work in Petersburg Art Week, Russia. In June 2011, she made a Studio space in her Kyiv apartment, where she commenced a series of paintings for her upcoming personal exhibition. The first retrospective to be held of her work was the \\"NoConcept\\" exhibition at Mystetskyi Prostir 365 Gallery, Kyiv, in 2011. On 7 December 11, two paintings \\"Chichkan's Skull\\" and \\"Eyes\\" from \\"NoConcept\\" collection were sold on the auction for the private collections of Vasily Bondarchuk and Alena Vinnitskaya where Vladimir Dantes was the auctionist. Traditionally, the interpretation of Nesheva's works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, as stated by Art Ukraine, \\"In Contemporary art, which is so closely relying on text and ideas, the lack of concept is perceived as concept. That is why the title of Nesheva's project, \\"NoConcept\\", may seem as just another non-conformist game, \\"rebellious art\\". But at this show, unlike with most Contemporary art, you won't find anything that speaks of protest, or urges one to do something. Most of the works, presented at the show, are portraits. That is – representations of people's faces, something that in art- history is usually (and sometimes mistakenly) named \\"portrait\\". But these are not portraits of real people and not even collective images. Done in photorealist way but still not completely following the conventions of the technique, her characters do not lack realness. These ‘molds’ of reality seem very much like hand of prehistorical men in caves – they exist no matter who and why there were made.\\" alt= In 2012, Nesheva took part in Festival of Contemporary arts \\"Art Olimp\\", Kyiv, and in the \\"First Odessa International Festival of the Arts\\", Odessa. On 14 March 2012, Nesheva's painting \\"Blue Dog\\" was presented as a lot at the charity fundraising event \\"Share the warmth of the soul with a four-legged friend\\" to raise money for the charitable foundation \\"Sirius\\", the animal shelter. On 22 November 2012, Nesheva had her second exhibition \\"DRAMA\\" at Mystetskyi Prostir 365 Gallery, Kyiv. Nesheva said about her work: \\"Souls lost in love, in prostration. Weightlessness. Passion. Grace. With / without faces, without masks, without borders ... “DRAMA” is a series of paintings depicting semi-naked female bodies. But this is by no means blatant vulgarity and not even eroticism – it's just a woman. Alive woman, packed in silence. Each of these bodies cary an emotion that seeks attention and comfort, which is not able to break free. These paintings are silent, but silent loudly.\\" In December 2012, Nesheva's paintings \\"Woman\\" and \\"No Thoughts\\" were published in the \\"City\\" magazine. In 2013, Nesheva participated in Modern Art Festival, Kyiv. In 2013, Nesheva had \\"Retrospective\\" exhibition at Mainstream Girls Gallery, Kyiv. This exhibition lionized the artist, brought into full public view the scope of her old and unseen artistry, and became a turning point, which marked the beginning of a new period of the author's work. On 29 November 2013, Nesheva was one of the painters presented in the \\"Hype\\" exhibition at Kosoy Kaponir Fortress, Kyiv.alt=In April 2014, Greter Art Centre, Kyiv, organized the exhibition \\"Phoenix. Rebirth\\". Nesheva was one of the four artists presented: Maria Krivopishina, Petra Rubar, a world-renowned sculptor Dmitry Yves, whose works are in the private collection of Patricia Cass and Monica Bellucci. This exhibition is relevant for socio-cultural development and society in general, as it brings up the subject of contrast of the external and internal state of the soul, entering a new level of perception. While \\"Phoenix. Rebirth\\" exhibition bears the theme of rebirth, restoration, artists' work illustrates the ambiguous idea of death for the sake of life. The essence of the exhibition is to show the transition from the past to the present and such an ephemeral future. In June 2014, Greter Art Centre hosted another extensive exhibit \\"Illusion...Reality?\\" Nesheva was among two other represented artists: Liliya Isyk and Petra Rybar. Nesheva designates her series of paintings as a \\"dramatic story, which is full of subtle emotion and photographic accuracy of the image.\\" As stated by Darina Fialko for \\"Ukurier\\" magazine: \\"Among the exhibited work of Nesheva, one can fall in love with black and white paintings, which, as stated in the press release, are \\"silent out loud\\". Every brush stroke gives you chills, as if canvases speak to the viewer differently: loudly and in whispers, strictly and sensually.\\" In 2016, Ukrainian art dealer, Anna Turayeva, offered Nesheva to exhibit series of her works at the \\"Art Basel\\", the premier art show of the Americas offering a premier platform for renowned artists. Five of Nesheva's paintings: \\"Pigeon Lady\\", \\"A Girl in A Musk\\", \\"Black Flame\\", \\"Birch\\", \\"Skull\\" and \\"Eyes\\" are displayed in Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, to this day. In December 2016, Nesheva presented her paintings at the art exhibition within the Fashion Air Days at the Contemporary Art Center M17, Kyiv.

Career   Activism  MacArthur active in social causes, including bringing concerts to prisons and to settlement houses. She was president of the Women's Auxiliary of the University Settlement Society of New York. During World War I, MacArthur was founder and president of Le Cercle Rochambeau, a women's war relief organization, and president of the National Association for Mothers of Defenders of Democracy. She had an apartment on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and may have been involved in the Allied secret service during the war. She wrote \\"Short Talk on Suffrage\\" (1915), noting that \\"We suffer from inertia and from the dread of big changes which seem in the nature of upheavals.

She was not a professional pianist, but played socially, on the radio, and at benefit concerts with other musicians.  The Apocalypse  As a librettist, MacArthur was known as co-writer (with Henri Pierre Roché) of The Apocalypse (1921), a dramatic oratorio. The Apocalypse was based on Biblical themes (with sections titled \\"Belshazzar's Feast\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Babylon\\", and \\"The Millennium\\"), but also had clear references to the more recent trauma of World War I. The National Federation of Music Clubs held a contest, and awarded $5000 to the MacArthur/Roché libretto and the music by Paolo Gallico. The Apocalypse was first performed at the Federation's biennial meeting in Davenport, Iowa, in 1921; the following year, was performed by the Oratorio Society of New York, at Carnegie Hall.

Brake was the first Canadian journalist to face both criminal and civil charges. He won the civil case, while the criminal charges are still pending. Legal experts and press freedom groups such as Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, the Canadian Association of Journalists feared that if the charges were upheld it would give precedence to property rights over media rights as defined in case law and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The case also drew international attention from the Fahmy Foundation, Reporters without Borders, and was cited as a concern by the Press Freedom Index. The 29-page unanimous decision by the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, established an important legal precedent across Canada protecting the legal rights of media against useof injunctions. Brake was the recipient of the 20th annual Press Freedom Award, awarded annually by the Canadian Committee for World Press Freedom, the 2018 PEN Canada/Ken Filkow Prize for freedom of expression, and co-recipient, with Indigenous journalist Karyn Pugliese, of the 2019 Elias Boudinot Free Press Award, issued by the Native American Journalists Association.  Early life and education  Brake was born in Newfoundland and raised in Ottawa; he does not identify as being indigenous, but says he has some Miꞌkmaq ancestry. Brake graduated from Algonquin College in Ottawa in 2001.  Career  From 2012 to 2017, Brake was a journalist at The Independent based in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2017, he joined APTN News as a reporter, and works in their Ottawa bureau.  Muskrat Falls  Muskrat Falls is a natural 15 metre waterfall located on the lower Churchill River about 25 kilometers west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador with great hydropower potential. From 1970 to the present plans were put in place to develop hydro-electricity. This includes development known as the Lower Churchill Project, which has raised concerns of scientists and local Inuit about methyl-mercury poisoning of the water, wildlife and food sources. Local Indigenous groups say they ere not properly consulted before the project began, and hosted a series of demonstrations against the project, including hunger strikes in 2013. The Nunatsiavut Government, which represents the Inuit of Labrador, was unsuccessful in using the courts to try and halt the project. = Civil charges = In October 2016, Brake was covering the Muskrat Falls story for The Independent. Indigenous demonstrators, who call themselves land and water protectors, broke a lock on October 22 and entered the property of Nalcor Energy. Brake followed the protesters filming and documenting what happened to them over the course of several days. He was the sole reporter inside the facility. When Nalcor filed and was granted an injunction to get the demonstrators off the property, they listed Brake on the injunction without mentioning that he was a journalist and not part of the protest. Brake was charged criminally with mischief and disobeying a court order and with civil contempt proceedings in Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court, because he'd been present on the property. The injunction was issued on October 16, 2016 and an ex parte contempt appearance order issued on October 24, 2016.https://records.court.nl.ca/public/supremecourt/decisiondownload/?decision- id=5521&mode;=stream At least one local rally was held in support of Brake demanding the charges be dropped. Brake fought the civil charges but lost. On March 15, 2017, Justice George Murphy of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador wrote in his decision: “Mr. Brake’s status as a journalist was not a material fact and there was no obligation on Nalcor to bring that fact to the attention of the Court on their application for the Injunction Order or the Contempt Appearance Order.” = The Court of Appeal= The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, the province's highest court December 12, 2017.APTN intervened in the case and Pugliese, then the executive director of news, testified personally, arguing media to be present at conflicts involving Indigenous Peoples, with reference to the calls to action of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which had submitted its final report in December 2015. In his decision issued March 28, 2019 Justice Derek Green stated: “The evidence from APTN, which I accept, is that Aboriginal communities have been historically under-represented in the Canadian media.” The decision referenced both the Charter rights to free expression for journalists and stated the need for reconciliation “places a heightened importance on ensuring that independently-reported information about (A)boriginal issues, including (A)boriginal protests, is available to the extent possible.” Nalcour did not appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. The case established an important legal precedent for press freedom. It prevents the arbitrary use of injunctions against journalists and recognizes the important role journalists have in covering protests and Indigenous issues in Canada. = Criminal charges = As of September 2019, lawyers for the crown filed criminal charges of mischief and unlawfully disobeying an order of the court against Brake even though the charges were based on the same set of facts which Justice Green had dismissed in the civil case. In the September court appearance Brake filed a charter challenge to ask for a stay of proceedings, and Brake's lawyer Geoff Budden said he would be arguing the charges are an \\"abuse of process.\\" In November 2019 the Crown decided to drop the charge against Brake of unlawfully disobeying an order of the court, but decided to pursue a charge of mischief over $5,000. Ultimately they dropped those charges in March 2020 as they were unlikely to win.

Generals wear golden stars instead of a gorget patches, while army recruits wear silver stars until they are assigned to a unit after basic training. Originally made from colored cloth, respectively embroidered cloth for Granatieri, Carabinieri and general staff members, gorget patches have been made since 1973 from enamelled metal. :: All patches below are worn on the left side as seen by the reader.

Line infantry regiments were always raised in pairs, forming together a brigade and from 1936 a division. Originally the gorget patches of units from other arms and corps assigned to the division were overlaid on the gorget patch of the two regiments of a brigade or division. However, as after World War II infantry regiments with different gorget patches made up the army's divisions this practice was abandoned. Today the only exception is the Mechanized Brigade \\"Sassari\\", which still fields its two original regiments. Infantry personnel not assigned to a regiment wear a scarlet patch with two points. The 66th Infantry Regiment \\"Trieste\\" modified its gorget patch once it became an airmobile unit.

Today the minimum height to join the speciality is 190 cm and members of the regiment wear a bearskin cap. Granatieri wear a double- sized, rectangular scarlet gorget patch with a stylized silver Austrian knot. The gorget patches of units from other arms and corps assigned to the Mechanized Brigade \\"Granatieri di Sardegna\\" are overlaid on the Grantieri's patch. * Bersaglieri: originally skirmishers, scouts and sharpshooters of the Royal Sardinian Army. Members were chosen for their shooting skills and stamina. During the Cold War they were employed as mechanized infantry. Bersaglieri wear a red fez with their service uniform and wide-brimmed black hat with a bushel of wood grouse feathers to their ordinary and ceremonial uniforms. Bersaglieri wear a crimson gorget patch with two points. * Alpini: originally mountain infantry recruited locally in the Alpine valleys. Alpini wear a brown felt cap with their service uniform and the Cappello Alpino with to their ordinary and ceremonial uniforms. Alpini wear a green gorget patch with two points. Unlike the Granatieri and Bersaglieri the Alpini have branched out and artillery, engineer, signals, transport and material, medical, etc. units have acquired the Alpini's headgear and traditions, which led to gorget patches that combine the Alpini's gorget patch with other arms and corps' gorget patches. * Paracadutisti: the first paratrooper units were raised shortly before World War II and were an all-volunteer formation. Today the paratroopers retain above average requirements for recruits. Paracadutisti wear a red beret and azure rectangular gorget patches with a golden wing with seven feathers, a white parachute, and a silver Gladius with scarlet crossguard. Like the Alpini the Paracadutisti have branched out and units from other arms and corps assigned to the Paratroopers Brigade \\"Folgore\\" and the Army Special Forces Command wear now a combination of their gorget patch and the Paracadutisti's patch. * Lagunari: are the armies youngest speciality and were raised to defend the Venetian lagoon (). Originally they were recruited from Venice and the communities surrounding the Venetian lagoon. They wear a green beret and scarlet rectangular gorget patches with a tapered top, below which the winged golden Lion of Saint Mark with a white aureola, holding a sword in his right paw and resting his left paw on a closed bible. Behind the lion are two crossed rifles and an anchor and above him a golden crown. Until 1 June 1999 the Carristi (Tankers) were a speciality of the infantry, which on that date was transferred to the cavalry.

In case one of the regiments listed below is reformed, then the corresponding gorget patch will be issued to regiment's personnel. Italian infantry regiments were always raised in pairs, which formed together one brigade. The regiments were initially only numbered and identified as \\"[regiment's number] Regiment of the Brigade \\"[brigade's name]\\"\\". Only during World War I did the brigade's name pass to the regiments. Before World War II the army formed binary divisions with sister regiments, which in some cases received the name of the division they were assigned to. If such a renaming occurred during World War II the division's name follows the regiment's name in brackets: i.e. the 65th and 66th Regiment \\"Valtellina\\" entered the 101st Motorized Division \\"Trieste\\" and were renamed \\"Trieste\\". Therefore, in the list below these two regiments are listed as: \\"65th and [66th] Regiment \\"Valtellina\\" (\\"Trieste\\")\\". The regiments 1 to 18 were formed before 1848 as units of the Royal Sardinian Army. The regiments 19 to 94 were formed between the First Italian War of Independence and 1884. The regiments 95 to 282, with the exception of the 182nd, were raised during World War I. The 182nd Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" is the only Italian infantry regiment raised after World War II and the only regiment of the army to not have received gorget patches. The regiment's 233 to 282 were raised in 1917 and received gorget patches divided horizontally twice. The 291st and 292nd Infantry Regiment \\"Zara\\" were raised during World War II. The regiments of the 300 series were raised during World War II to augment some of the binary divisions. Regiments which are currently active are in square brackets.

On the same date the tankers speciality was transferred from the infantry to the cavalry. Line cavalry personnel wear regiment-affiliated colored gorget patches with three points. Personnel of the cavalry that is not assigned to a regiment wear an orange gorget patch with three points. Tankers, whose speciality was founded as part of the infantry, continue to wear a two-pointed gorget patch, which has traditionally been the patch for infantry specialties. The tankers' gorget patch is red with two points in a light blue field.

Army Commissariat Corps  The Army Commissariat Corps () was formed on 1 January 1998 by the merger of the Army Commissariat Corps and the Army Administration Corps. Before the merger Commissariat Corps personnel wore violet gorget patches with one point, while Administration Corps personnel wore black gorget patches with one point and a sky blue edge. The personnel of the Commissariat Corps tasked with the role of food supplies wore sky blue gorget patches with one point. These three gorget patches were combined with the gorget patches of specialities of other arms and corps, resulting in dozens of variations. After the merger personnel wore black gorget patches with one point and a double-colored edge in violet and sky blue. This gorget patch was also combined with other gorget patches resulting in dozens of new variations. In 2003 the Commissariat Corps introduced a rectangular blue gorget patch with a golden laurel wreath, which is not combined with any other patch.

Biography  He received his primary education in Piarist schools; showing an early talent for music and drawing. From 1817 to 1822, he studied in the Fine Arts Department at the University of Warsaw, where his instructors included Paweł Maliński and Antoni Brodowski. During that time he was awarded a scholarship and two exhibition medals. From 1823 to 1828, he studied sculpture with Bertel Thorvaldsen in Rome; returning to Warsaw through Switzerland, France and Germany. His first orders for sculptures came from the Grand Theatre and the poet/statesman, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, who was an acquaintance of Thorvaldsen. In 1833, he entered a competition for the post of \\"Professor of Sculpture\\" at the Jagiellonian University. He won the competition, but never assumed his post, due to cutbacks related to the recent November Uprising, which nearly resulted in the University's closure. From 1834 to 1840, he taught modeling and drawing at the . His major statues include \\"Dying Psyche\\" at the Grand Theatre, and figures of Stanisław Kostka Potocki and his wife Aleksandra Lubomirska, on the at Wilanów Palace. Notable among his numerous busts are those of Klementyna Hoffmanowa and Samuel Linde. He also did portrait medallions. The philosopher and historian, Władysław Tatarkiewicz, was his grandson.

Thatcher (March 25, 1936 – December 7, 2019) was an American computer scientist, and the inventor of the first screen reader, a type of assistive technology that enables the use of a computer by people with visual impairments. Thatcher was also important to the development of the accessibility consulting industry. Among many other awards, Thatcher was awarded the first ACM SIG Access Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computing and Accessibility for his contributions to digital accessibility in 2008.  Career  Thatcher earned one of the first PhDs in Computer Science in 1963 from the University of Michigan. His thesis advisor, Dr. Jesse Wright, was blind, and together they joined the Mathematical Sciences Department of IBM Research, to work on practical computing and the development of an audio- based computer access system for the IBM Personal Computer. The result of this work was the one of the first screen readers for DOS, originally called PC- SAID, or Personal Computer Synthetic Audio Interface Driver. This was renamed and released in 1984 as IBM Screen Reader, which became the proprietary eponym for that general class of assistive technology. Thatcher went on to lead the development of IBM Screen Reader/2, the first screen reader for a graphical user interface. In 1996, Thatcher joined the IBM Accessibility Center in Austin, Texas, where he helped establish the internal IBM Accessibility Guidelines for software development. These guidelines helped inform the later development of the W3C standard WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). Thatcher retired from IBM in 2000, to become an independent accessibility consultant. He retired from accessibility consulting in 2016.

The station was last owned by The Charter Company. WMJX's broadcast license was revoked by the Federal Communications Commission due to the use of fake news stories to promote a 1975 contest and an error in which advertisers were billed for commercials that did not air. History WGBS- FM and WJHR WGBS-FM began broadcasting in August 1948. The station was owned by the Fort Industry Company—later and better known as Storer Broadcasting—and served as the companion and simulcast partner to 710 AM WGBS. WGBS-FM broadcast with an effective radiated power of 1,400 watts. Deviations from its AM simulcast were few: in 1953, WGBS allowed the University of Miami to broadcast its special events over the FM transmitter. As a result, WGBS-FM broke away to air baseball games and concerts by the university symphony orchestra. By 1957, WGBS-FM's operating hours had been limited to six hours a day, six days a week. Despite the limited hours, the late 1950s and 1960s led to improvements for WGBS-FM. Two power increases, to 18 kW (authorized in 1959) and 100 kW (in 1964), expanded the station's coverage area. WGBS-FM proved more useful during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when night airtime on WGBS and two other high-power Miami AM stations was used for Voice of America broadcasts to Cuba; the station continued local service on FM during the three weeks that airtime was requisitioned. The March 1968 fire that wiped out WAJA- TV's studios also affected the WGBS-FM transmitter, housed alongside its former sister station. In May 1969, WGBS-FM became WJHR, honoring Storer co- founder J. Harold Ryan. Most of the station's music programming, which varied in format over the years, was automated as WJHR. Sale to Bartell In 1970, Storer announced its intention to sell all but one of the company's FM stations. In the first such sale, Bartell Broadcasting acquired WJHR and WDEE- FM in Detroit in a $1,225,000 deal made public in April. The sale closed early in 1971, and WJHR gave way to Top 40-formatted WMYQ. WMYQ was the first major FM Top 40 outlet in South Florida, an aggressive, promotionally minded outlet that gave away some $50,000 a year in its contests. The station hired Roby Yonge away from competitor WLQY (soon to become WHYI-FM) in 1973 to do mornings and fired him the next year amidst a major staff shakeup. Generally, the station was considered a revolving door of talent and management; other notable people to work for WMYQ included Lee Abrams, Jerry Clifton, Kris Erik Stevens, and Jack McCoy. The staff shakeup came at a critical time for WMYQ. The Charter Company of Jacksonville had agreed to acquire six Bartell stations for $8.675 million that June; additionally, WHYI \\"Y-100\\" had gone on air in August 1973 and rocketed over the next 18 months to number two in the market, driving three other stations out of Top 40 in the process. In early 1975, with ratings not improving, the station shook up its news staff. Changes and contesting problems On December 18, 1974, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) censured Bartell for its conduct in running the \\"Magnum One\\" contest, saying that WMYQ had overstated the prize as being a \\"massive treasure\\" when it was only worth $10,000. Citing a crowded marketplace with a glut of \\"Q\\" call signs causing listener confusion, WMYQ became WMJX on October 1, 1975. However, a battle was just beginning. The next year, the FCC designated WMJX's license renewal for hearing over falsified news and misleading advertising. The centerpiece of the allegations was an April 1975 vacation contest by morning personality Greg Austin, who created reports from the Devil's Triangle that were integrated into the station's newscasts. Another area of concern was inconsistent billing practices, which general manager Carl Como pinned on the transition to a computerized billing system, during which time the station did not broadcast commercials on Sundays but some new invoices went out billing advertisers for them. Even as the station's license challenge remained pending, WMJX made ratings improvements. By the start of 1977, it had closed the gap with WHYI to less than a rating point and climbed to a tie for fourth place in the overall market. However, the challenge forced Bartell, now fully owned by Downe Communications, to scrap a sale of its WADO New York when the FCC conditioned action on the license transfer on the WMJX hearing. Administrative law judge Thomas B. Fitzpatrick issued his initial decision in January 1978 and ruled that Bartell Broadcasting of Florida should not have WMJX's license renewed; in addition to the issues raised in the hearing, he noted the 1974 censure over the Magnum One contest. At the same time, its ratings fell again, with WHYI retaking a commanding lead. Bartell attempted to take advantage of the FCC's then-new distress sale policy and sell WMJX to Wave Communications, a Black-owned firm, for $1 million, though the FCC denied the request in July 1979 because the initial decision was adverse to Bartell. Charter had, in its attempts to appease the FCC, removed local management and some personnel at its corporate office; it had also increased WMJX's charitable involvement. However, the station struggled to overcome such revelations as the discovery by new management that the station had attempted to improve its ratings by giving away stereo equipment to a family that had four Arbitron diaries; the station dismissed the employee responsible. WMJX and WHYI were responsible for forcing the Bee Gees to bring forward the release date of their new album Spirits Having Flown; WHYI began playing an alleged pirate copy of the album on the air, followed by WMJX. In the ensuing saga, WMJX DJ Russ Oasis was fired after he called WHYI to see if they were still broadcasting it, then played the telephone call on the station, violating FCC rules. Final years In February 1979, WMJX pivoted to all-disco. The format didn't last, and by 1980 WMJX was back to top 40 and rumored for a flip to country. After fighting for years in an attempt to keep the license, Charter indicated to Broadcasting magazine at the start of 1981 that it would abandon its efforts and shut the station down soon. However, station management indicated it had plans to continue the appeal, saying that Charter should not be held responsible for Bartell's indiscretions; the FCC countered by noting the two were now under common ownership. In early February, the station announced it would close at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, February 15. At that time, Bob Allen, the general manager of the station, issued a final statement, and Stuart Elliot signed the station off after playing \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" by The Beatles. Fight for a successor Even before WMJX had left the air, applications came to the Federal Communications Commission for the frequency it would vacate, with the initial field yielding more than 60 interested parties. In 1982, the FCC designated seven applications for hearing: South Florida Broadcasting Company, Radiocentro Broadcasting Company, First Black Broadcasters of Miami, Constance J. Wodlinger, Onyx Broadcasting of Miami, Rana Broadcasting Company, and Southwest Radio Enterprises. The new station would receive as its final assignment 96.5 MHz, instead of 96.3, as WMJX would have been relocated there anyway in a 1980 reallocation of various FM station frequencies in Florida. In the case of Radiocentro and Southwest Radio, proposals to use WMJX's former antenna, diplexed with WAIA on the tower of WPBT, came into doubt when WAIA indicated it no longer had the capacity to diplex another station on its antenna and would not diplex a new station—a blow to Radiocentro. Other applicants proposed using a site on the candelabra tower built by Guy Gannett Communications. The initial decision, issued on May 16, 1984, gave the nod to South Florida Broadcasting, owned by former state representative Elaine Bloom, which proposed an ethnic radio station. The FCC dismissed the Rana bid because Liberty City, as a neighborhood of Miami, was not sufficient to be a community of license; Onyx, which was 30 percent owned and managed by WPLG-TV anchor Dwight Lauderdale, could not prove its financial qualifications adequately; and First Black had attempted to block other applicants from using the candelabra. However, on appeal, the FCC Review Board remanded the case to the administrative law judge in December 1984, over the antenna site issues of various applicants. With the case droning on, Wodlinger emerged from the crowd: in 1985, she moved to buy out all of the competing applicants and win the frequency. On June 15, 1985, they launched a new station using the 96X moniker and the WCJX call letters. (Within months of WMJX folding, a radio station in Boston picked up the call letters.) The $2.95 million investment Wodlinger made paid off when Beasley Broadcast Group acquired the new station in September for $10.6 million, entering the Miami market.

His father was the well-known Classical painter, Antoni Brodowski, and he was the older brother of Józef Brodowski, a prominent painter of battle scenes. His first painting lessons came from his father. After that, he studied in the workshops of Aleksander Kokular and Antoni Blank. In 1841, he went to Rome. Two years later, after mounting an exhibition in Warsaw, he moved to Paris, where he perfected his techniques with the battle painter, Horace Vernet. His works also show the influence of Aleksander Orłowski. He died, aged only twenty-six, of unspecified causes; although his death came shortly after the beginning of the French Revolution of 1848.

A younger son of an English tenant farmer in Worcestershire, Insole made judicious use of significant financial assistance from his wider family to move to Cardiff, Wales, in 1828, to enter into partnership there as a brick, timber and coal merchant (1829–1830), and to become an independent coal producer and shipper in 1832. He pioneered the introduction and early success of South Wales steam coal in the London and international markets and his coal contracts underpinned Lucy Thomas's reputation as \\"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\\". Insole is claimed to have been the first to supply the London market (1830), the international market (Malta, 1831), and the Royal Navy (1831) with South Wales steam coal. Insole was for many years the largest shipper of steam coal at Cardiff.  Early life  George Insole was baptised in Worcester on 5 December 1790, the fifth of six children of William Insole and Phoebe Insole (née Stinton). During Insole's childhood his father was a tenant farmer in Wichenford, near Worcester. In 1819 he married Mary Finch in Worcester and by 1820 was working there as a carpenter and cabinet maker. They had six children, two sons and four daughters. The two older children were baptised at St Helen's Church, Worcester, but from 1823 to 1827 Insole was associated with the Angel Street Independent (Congregational) Meeting House in Worcester.  Coal merchant  Insole moved to Cardiff in 1828, and by late 1829 was in partnership with Richard Biddle as Insole & Biddle, brick, timber and coal merchants. The move and partnership were supported by family loans and inheritances. Biddle was one of the first agents in Cardiff for Robert Thomas's Waun Wyllt \\"smokeless\\" steam coal, sent by barge down the Glamorganshire Canal from Merthyr Tydfil, and had established a customer base in Cardiff prior to partnering with Insole. In 1830 Insole & Biddle had premises at the Wharf on the Glamorganshire Canal at Cardiff. The Insole & Biddle day book for 1830 records a shipment of 414 tons of Waun Wyllt steam coal to London. This consignment was later claimed to have been the largest cargo of coal ever shipped at the Glamorganshire Canal. The shipment did not make a profit but the quality of the coal eventually made it very popular for both household and Royal Navy use. Insole also developed markets for coal along the Severn Estuary and in Ireland. The first coal left The Insole & Biddle partnership was bankrupted in early 1831. Insole was able to recover his financial position within a few months, and was also left a substantial inheritance that year. From his offices in Cardiff at the mouth of the Glamorganshire Canal, he continued as agent for Waun Wyllt coal, and contracts were written to supply London-based coal merchants. These contracts helped establish the reputation of Welsh coal in the London markets, and were the basis on which Lucy Thomas (widow of Robert) became known as \\"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\\". Although Thomas has been credited with these ventures, much of the success was due to Insole. Retrieved 4 January 2020. While their assertions were not universally accepted, the Insoles claimed to have been the first to supply the London market (in 1830), the international market (Malta, in 1831), and the Royal Navy (in 1831) with South Wales steam coal.  Coal producer  Entrance to the West Docks, Cardiff, in 1840, where Insole had his commercial offices; also see this view of the docks in 1849 In 1832 Insole leased the Maesmawr pit (Llantwit Fardre) to become a coal producer and shipper in his own right. He was one of the first to open offices at the Cardiff Docks when the Bute West Dock was opened in 1839. When his son James Harvey Insole came of age in 1842, Insole took him into partnership as George Insole & Son. In 1844, as the Maesmawr seam was becoming depleted, they leased and revived collieries at Cymmer and in 1848 opened 36 coking ovens to supply the Taff Vale Railway Company, of which Insole was a principal promoter. Up to 1847 the Insoles mainly supplied the coastal markets of the Bristol Channel (Bristol, Gloucester), the Cornish ports (St. Ives, Penzance, Fowey), and the Irish markets (Limerick, Dublin, Youghal, Waterford, Cork) with steam coal. Insole continued to develop his international trade and afterwards supplied markets in France, the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and South America and became the largest shipper of steam coal at Cardiff. In Cardiff, Insole was associated with St John's Church in 1830 (where his daughter was baptised) and afterwards with the independent meetings at the Bethany Baptist Chapel (where his infant son was buried in 1837) and the New Trinity Congregational Chapel (making significant contributions to its rebuilding in 1846). Insole was involved in the introduction of British Schools in Cardiff and served as a town councillor for the South Ward of Cardiff.  Death and legacy  Insole died on 1 January 1851, aged 60, at his residence in Crockherbtown, Cardiff. The cause of death was \\"Disease of Heart many years. Paralysis 1 week\\".Death Certificate. General Register Office for England and Wales, 1851 March Quarter, Cardiff, vol. 26, p. 287. He was buried at St Margaret's Church, Roath on 7 January 1851. The high regard in which he was held is indicated in the two prize-winning elegies on Insole presented at the 1851 Cymmer Eisteddfod. Insole can be credited with much of the early success of South Wales steam coal in the London and international markets. The firm established by Insole continued in business until 1940. Selected histories The following accounts present Insole as a pioneering entrepreneur of South Wales steam coal, although each is unreliable in various details, especially regarding his origins and early years as a merchant in Cardiff. They also overlook Biddle's earlier, independent sourcing of Waun Wyllt steam coal and its introduction by him to the Cardiff market prior to the Insole & Biddle partnership. * Wilkins, Charles (1888).

Following six years in solitary confinement, he died while detained at the main penitentiary in Ludwigsburg, during the first part of 1940. The death was reported as a suicide. Life Eugen Wiedmaier was born into a working class family in Zuffenhausen, then just outside Stuttgart to the north. He attended school locally and then undertook commercial training. He worked for a succession of businesses as a sales representative till 1932. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1918, switching almost immediately to the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD). As the USDP itself broke apart, in 1919 he joined the newly launched Communist Party (KPD), remaining a member at least till the party was outlawed in 1933. Wiedmaier was a co- founder of the Free Young Socialists in Württemberg and from 1920 served as secretary of the Württemberg Young Communists (KJD). It was also in 1920 that he became a member of the Communist Party's Württemberg regional leadership team (Berzirksleitung). Wiedmaier relocated to Berlin in 1921, although there are indications that he retained close links with his home region. In 1922 he joined the KJD's Berlin-based national leadership team, appointed \\"Secretary for Anti-militarist Work\\" (\\"Sekretär für antimilitaristische Arbeit\\"). In 1923, following the French military occupation of the Ruhr the KJD leadership sent him to the region as a party instructor. After serving for several months as secretary to the KJD regional leadership team (Berzirksleitung), he was appointed to take responsibility for KJD party instructor activities across the Saar, Palatinate and Württemberg regions. 1923 was also the year in which Eugen Wiedmaier married Maria Siegloch (1896–1977), the daughter of a railway worker and, like Wiedmaier, a communist activist originally from Zuffenhausen. She came to the partnership with a son from her first marriage, but there is no mention of any children born from the marriage of Eugen and Maria Wiedmaier. In 1924 the Party Central Committee summoned Wiedmaier back to Berlin where he served between 1924 and 1929 as a member of the regional leadership team (Berzirksleitung) for Berlin-Brandenburg and as a \\"Policy Leader\\" (\\"Polleiter\\") for the Berlin-Tempelhof sub-region. In June 1929 he was a delegate at the twelfth party conference. The Central Committee now sent him to Danzig where during 1929/31 he served as party secretary for the Berzirksleitung. During 1931/32 he filled the same role in Silesia. Returning to the region of his birth, starting in 1932 he served as Organisation Secretary (\\"Organisationssekretär\\") for the Party Berzirksleitung in Württemberg. In January 1933 a National Socialist government took power. During the first part of the year Democraic Germany was transformed progressively but rapidly into a one-party dictatorship. Although the Commuist Party was now banned, Wiedmaier moved in February 1933 to the Magdeburg region, accepting a Central Committee appointment as a party instructor with responsibilities extending across central-southern Germany, notably Thuringia and Saxony. By the start of 1934 he was active as a party instructor in Baden. It was here that he was arrested, together with other party activists and officials, at a clandestine meeting in Karlsruhe on 26 January 1934. It turned out that a party courier from Berlin whom they had been expecting to join them was a police spy. In December 1934 he faced the usual charge, under circumstances of this kind, of preparing to commit high treason (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). and was sentenced by the Regional High Court in Karlsruhe to a thirty month jail term. Several other prominent local communists were convicted and sentenced at the same time. Communist networks after 1933 were by definition highly secretive, making their detailed operational arrangements hard to determine for the authorities and, indeed, for subsequent researchers. In 1936 major trial took place at Kalrsruhe following the identification of a surviving network. Although he had by this time been incarcerated for more that two years, Wiedmaier was among those tried, convicted and sentenced. In practical terms, this could be seen as a retrial: it involved an increase of the jail sentence he was already serving to a total length of twelve and a half years. Eugen Wiedmaier died at the main penitentiary in Ludwigsburg, during the first part of 1940. Sources differ over whether the death was a suicide or a murder.

Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus niphophila was first formally described in 1929 by Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in Maiden's book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus, from material collected near \\"Pretty Point\\" on Mount Kosciuszko. In 1973, Lawrie Johnson and Donald Blaxell reduced the species to a subspecies of E. pauciflora as E. pauciflora subsp. niphophila. The epithet (niphophila) is derived from ancient Greek meaning \\"snow-loving\\", referring to the alpine habitat of this eucalypt.  Distribution and habitat This subspecies occurs on the highest peaks suitable for tree growth in the Snowy Mountains, including in the Kosciuszko National Park, extending to Bimberi Peak in the Australian Capital Territory and the highest peaks in Victoria, including Mount Hotham, Mount Bogong, Mount Torbreck and Mount Wellington.

It is surrounded by the Serbian municipality of Priboj, in Zlatibor District, making it an exclave of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and an enclave within Serbia, 1130 meters from the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sastavci is the neighboring village in Serbia. Demographics With an area of , Međurečje has 173 inhabitants as of 2013 census. In 1999, the village had 75 households with a population of 270. Vital infrastructure in the enclave of Međurečje is tied to the Serbian municipality of Priboj. A majority of the population works in Priboj. However, the land of Međurečje is registered in the municipality of Rudo (Bosnia and Herzegovina), where the population of the village pays its land tax. History Historic facts about the formation of the enclave within the territory of Serbia are not known, but it is believed to be tied to the period after the 1878 Congress of Berlin, when the Austro- Hungarian and Ottoman Empires were sharing the border and Austria-Hungary was allowed to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is endemic to Sumatra where it has been recorded from the middle Batang Hari River and from the middle Musi River drainage. An undescribed similar taxon has been seen in central Kalimantan and this is possibly a third species in the genus Luciocephalus. On Sumatra Luciocephalus aura and l. pulcher are both found in the same areas but they appear to be syntopic with L. aura preferring the faster flowing habitats. It is an ambush predator and paternal mouthbrooder. It has a line of bright green spots along its flanks which distinguish it from L. pulcher.

History The barracks were built in 1938. Covering 13.7ha, they were named after the German-held village of Guillemont, which was retaken by British Empire Forces, in September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. The West Nova Scotia Regiment arrived at the barracks on 1 January 1940, and the Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, part of the Canadian 5th Brigade, were stationed at the barracks in late 1940. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspected the troops on 26 March 1941. The 3rd Training Regiment of the Royal Engineers were based there from 1954 until the early 1960s. It then became the home of the 1st Battalion the Parachute Regiment between 1963 and 1965. The site was purchased by Sun Microsystems in 1997 for £36 million. After Sun Microsystems moved to Reading, the property developer, Landid, bought the site in January 2011. In December 2013, a planning application to demolish the part built structures and to build 150 homes on the site was refused.
