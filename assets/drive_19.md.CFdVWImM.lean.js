From 1748 to 1749, he lived in Paris and Valenciennes, where he was a copyist for a merchant. After returning to Brugge, he was commissioned to paint a large landscape in the Town Hall at Kortrijk, modeled after the work of the Dutch master, Philips Wouwerman. Later, he created some large murals and bas- reliefs, many featuring horses and battlefields. He would eventually produce more than 1200 works, but he always earned his living primarily as an architect and builder. Around 1750 he became an architectural instructor at the Brugge Academie and, from 1775 until his death, he served as its Director; succeeding Jan Garemijn, with whom he occasionally lived.

He was born in Providence, RI, in 1980 and received his BA from Regis University, Denver, in 2002. ==Biography== Christian Rex van Minnen was born in 1980 in Providence, Rhode Island and grew up in Colorado. His father is a psychotherapist in Basalt, Colorado and was born in South Africa but did not have much direct contact. His uncles were fishermen and had a fish market in Charlestown, Rhode Island called Rathbones. He always doodled in high school and was introduced to painting before going to university. He is not formally trained in art but in 2002 he graduated with a BA from Regis University. He chose painting as a prime profession in 2005‚Äì2006. Early in his career he worked on a smaller scale of 18x24 inches. These were more personal pieces. Later, he moved into a larger scale and he had to change his technique and remove some of the complexity and try not to not to fill every square inch on the canvas. In 2006 he was a landscaper and completed a Masters in non-profit management while also working at a gallery. It was at time that he became frustrated and worked to use the internet to get around the traditional art scene. He has lived in Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Carbondale, Colorado from 2007 to 2014. In 2011, he did a residency at Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Snowmass, Colorado. He lived and worked in Coyoacan Mexico City for 3 months in 2011. While there, he worked with Mexican artist Rodrigo Cifuentes. From 2014 until 2017, he lived in Brooklyn. He now lives in Santa Clara. His first solo show in Europe was at the Gallery Paulson in Copenhagen in May 2014. In November 2018, Aaron Johnson and Van Minnen had their first exhibit together in Hong Kong. Johnson and van Minnen have been long time friends. Van Minnen works almost exclusively in painting but he has also made some ceramic sculptures. Van Minnen is married to Ashley Muse and they have a son, Desmond. ==Influences== Van Minnen's favorite artist is Otto Marseus van Schrieck, a Dutch master painter, best known for his paintings of forest flora and fauna. 500px Van Minnen has studied the following artists: Nicole Duennebier, Ryan Riss, Judy Pfaff, Jenny Morgan, Barnaby Furnas, Skinner, Erik Parker, Judy Fox, Kenny Scharf, Ryan Schneider, Amir Fallah, Martin Wittfooth, Gregory Jacobsen, Sinisa Kukec, Liz Craft, Wayne White, Ryan Travis Christian, Seamus Conley, Fulvio di Piazza, Mark Dean Veca, Tomoe Gokita, Robin Williams, Barnaby Whitfield, Julie Heffernan, Nicola Verlato, David Altmejd, Robert Hardgrave, Kim Keever, Aaron Johnson, Brendan Danielsson, Wangechi Mutu, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Aertsen. Hendrik Goltzius and the line work from Grotius can be seen in some of the tattooed skins. Influential authors have been John Steinbeck, Cormac McCarthy and the Mark Frost book, The Secret History of Twin Peaks An influence on van Minnen for the tattoos and use of the \\"swelling line\\", where the burin is manipulated to make lines thicker or thinner to create a tonal effect from a distance Rembrandt and the old masters have also been a major influence. Much of his color mixing and painting go back to this for technique. His colorful gummy bears go back to the Venetian school of mixing grays and colors along with complementary debt coloring. The gummy bears he paints are painted in reverse in that he paints the brightest colors first on a white oil background and then adds color on top. These gummy bears balance the heavy dark background. He enjoyed working in New York because of the environment and the competitiveness and pressure. New York to him represents ideas but he had a chance to go back to Colorado each summer for mountain biking, fishing and camping with his son. He has since gone to live in California to continue his surfing which comes through in his most recent paintings in painting tattoos of surfers on portraits. While painting he puts on audio books and podcasts in the background. What he plays depends on the state of mind of what he wants to paint. His listening tastes are very eclectic from country, to classical opera to rap. He has a playlist that shuffles Anya and Ministry. His preference in podcasts is for comedy. Van Minnen is a hard worker who doesn't wait for inspiration to paint but just shows up every day. He has a routine and works a regular work week. Film directors such as David Lynch (especially his 1990s series Twin Peaks). Werner Herzog and David Cronenberg have influenced van Minnen. But the greatest cinematic influence was the film series Alien especially Alien 2. Van Minnen saw this when he was young and the character Ellen Ripley to him represents his mother trying to save the kids from the parasites of anger, addiction and the environment. Van Minnen likes the early two movies more than the ones that came after it. One of the influences is a book he read when he was young was a nature field guide with drawings of parasites. ===Painting style=== He is interested in drawing the viewer into an attraction-repulsion feeding on the same part of the colors while the gummy bears draw the viewer in and the organs and tattoos push the viewer away. The production process involves a monochromatic underpainting while leaving the white of the canvas exposed for certain figures. While his Dutch Masters golden age paintings might try to glorify that period it is clear to him that the richness of materials in those paintings and the painting themselves represent colonial exploitation. He starts with underpaintings and then over paints with a semi transparent color, as was developed by Titian. He uses a dynamic color mixing which allows them to paint in layers and allows the light to mix with the color instead of mixing on the palette. Self-taught, he studied intensively a book called Methods and Materials of the Great Schools and Masters by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake. The underpaintings are monotypes he works on at home and then continues the over painting at his studio. This allows a quick production of monotypes where he can get a couple done per week and allows him to balance the months of painting and layers that have to go on top. In this way he can get ideas out quickly and not worry about capturing every single idea and painting at first. Van Minnen does not describe his work as macabre which would have to do with death and injury but rather about life and the absurd. His work has also been called Super-Realism because his figures and gummy bears leap off the canvas. Another series of decapitated heads on top of jelly bears project power and language. All of the figures' heads have been executed but it is not clear how or why. Van Minnen has also been compared to a modern Arcimboldo or a cross between a Natural history museum and H.R. Giger In 2014 Van Minnen added more color to his work. In 2017, while wandering Madrid Van Minnen picked up a watercolor kit and has been making a number of pieces when traveling and outside of the studio. In 2017 he started working on a series with real-world issues and social political images. He does not want to go back to previous styles and continues to innovate. ===Elements in the portraits=== The characters or people in van Minnen's portraits are not specific people but objects on which his elements are placed on top in an automatic manner. None of the elements are metaphors or symbols. His paintings are not puzzles to be decoded and broken down and analyzed. His elements repeat through his work starting from the earlier still life. *Circles with spirals and bead-like structures are used like repetitive words that lose their meaning with the repetition. *Tattoos on figures sometimes are not easy to read and they do not have a private meaning to Van Minnen. *Lack of eyes or mouths on the figures might make it easier for the viewer to look longer at the piece. *Tie-dyed colors in a portrait. ==Galleries of his art== *Gallery Poulsen, Copenhagen, Denmark *Ross + Kramer, New York City *Richard Heller Gallery, Los Angeles == Permanent collections == *Denver Art Museum *Djurhuus Collection *Colecci≈çn Solo *Richard B.

It has been in continuous use as a place of worship within the Church of Scotland, and is designated as a Category A listed building. ==History== The building was constructed between 1795 and 1798 for the 4th Duke of Gordon as the centrepiece for his planned village of Fochabers, to replace the existing parish church, now known as Bellie Old Church, which fell into disrepair after the congregation moved to Bellie Kirk. Little now remains of the old church itself, but the churchyard remained in use for some time and houses the 1826 Gordon Tomb. Bellie Kirk was designed by John Baxter, an Edinburgh architect who had studied in Rome, and its exterior has remained largely unaltered since it was completed in 1798, although some repairs and alterations were carried out in 1835 under the direction of Archibald Simpson, who also designed the nearby Gordon Chapel. This work saw the reversal of the internal layout, and the application of Greek detailing. The church's use as an active place of worship within the Church of Scotland has continued uninterrupted since it was built. Renovation work was carried out under George Bennet Mirchell and Son in 1954, in which the original orientation of the interior was restored. It was designated as a category A listed building in 1971. It underwent another substantial major renovation in 2010, with the removal of the fixed pews in favour of movable seating, and another reorientation of the nave, and the removal of the organ. ==Description== The church faces north towards Fochabers' High Street across The Square, presenting a tetrastyle portico frontage (the first of its kind in Scotland), with pedimented Roman Doric columns, all made of finely worked ashlar sandstone. The spire, the design of which was influenced by the work of James Gibbs, has a square clock stage, featuring a clock dated 1798, and an octagonal belfry, surmounted with a copper weathervane. Three doors lead from the portico into the entrance lobby, which has mirrored staircases leading to the galleries, which run along the east and west sides, and may have been installed during Simpson's 1835 alterations; the galleries are supported by Greek Doric columns. A trilogy of stained glass windows by Shona McInnes was installed in 1998, showing images of growth and harvest, the tree of life, and the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. ==Current Usage== The church is an active place of worship, with weekly Sunday services at 10 am. The incumbent minister is Rev Se√≤ras Orr. == References == == External links == * Parish Website Category:Churches in Moray Category:18th-century Protestant churches Category:Neoclassical architecture in Scotland Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray Category:Church of Scotland churches in Scotland Category:Listed churches in Scotland ","title":"Bellie Kirk"},{"id":"60290013","text":"Noah Balta (); (born 23 October 1999) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Richmond Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was drafted by Richmond with the 25th pick in the 2017 AFL national draft and made his debut for the club in round 1 of the 2019 season. In 2019 he was a VFL premiership player while playing reserves grade football for Richmond. ==Early life and junior football== Balta grew up in St Albans, a suburb 15 kilometres north-west of Melbourne. He was a passionate junior soccer player at St Albans Dinamo and the Melbourne Knights before he picked up Australian rules football at under 10 level with the Essendon Doutta Stars Football Club in the junior ranks of the Essendon District Football League. In 2014, Balta began training with the Calder Cannons junior development squad and in 2015 he played alongside fellow future AFL player Cam Rayner in an EDFL under 16s premiership with the Doutta Stars. In 2016 he played sporadically with the Calder Cannons in the TAC Cup and made a local football debut at age 16 with the Doutta Stars' senior EDFL team in July. At the end of that year, Balta participated in an under 17s All-Star match, played on the MCG as a curtain-raiser to that year's AFL grand final. In the summer of 2016/17, Balta participated in the AFL Academy program. As part of the program, he and 35 other highly rated draft prospects completed interstate and international training camps and spent two weeks training with an AFL club, with Balta spending his time at . He returned to TAC Cup football with Calder in 2017, playing primarily as a key forward. In June and July of that year Balta stepped away from state junior football to represent Vic Metro at the 2017 AFL Under 18 Championships where he was part of the tournament-winning side. Despite previously playing as a forward, Balta played exclusively as a defender at the tournament. Upon his return from the national championships Balta immediately recorded a best on ground performance for Calder that included 31 disposals, 10 inside 50s and four score assists while playing a multi-positional role that included stints in the ruck. It was at that time that AFL Media draft expert Callum Twomey upgraded him five spots to the 19th best prospect in the forthcoming draft. He finished the season by kicking multiple goals in four of his final eight matches despite being trialed in defence and the midfield during the closing stages of the season. Over the TAC Cup season he held averages of 15 disposals and 4.3 marks per match. Balta attended school and played football for St. Bernard College in Essendon, where he was part of the Herald Sun Shield-winning team in 2017. ===AFL recruitment=== Despite a minor knee injury that kept him from participating in some tests at the national draft combine in October 2017, Balta still managed top-ten results in both the standing and running vertical jump tests. He also ran the two kilometre time trial in six minutes and 50 seconds and recorded a 8.38 on the agility test. Following those results, ESPN draft expert Christopher Doerre labelled Balta the fifth best prospect available at the 2017 AFL draft. At the same time, Fox Footy had him ranked 17th. Pre-draft he was noted for his positional versatility, contested marking ability and long- kicking. In the days immediately prior to the draft, Draft Central projected him as a 15-35 draft selection while AFL Media left him out of their projected top 30. ===Junior statistics=== TAC Cup - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016 Calder Cannons  12  7  16  ‚Äî  64  20  84  24  21  2.3  ‚Äî  9.1  2.9  12.0  3.4  3.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017 Calder Cannons  12  13  12  ‚Äî  150  45  195  56  50  0.9  ‚Äî  11.5  3.5  15.0  4.3  3.8 - - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 20 ! 28 ! ‚Äî ! 214 ! 65 ! 279 ! 80 ! 56 ! 1.4 ! ‚Äî ! 10.7 ! 3.3 ! 14.0 ! 4.0 ! 2.8 } Under 18 National Championships - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017 Vic Metro  28  3  0  ‚Äî  23  4  27  9  4  0.0  ‚Äî  7.7  1.3  9.0  3.0  1.3 - - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 3 ! 0 ! ‚Äî ! 23 ! 4 ! 27 ! 9 ! 4 ! 0.0 ! ‚Äî ! 7.7 ! 1.3 ! 9.0 ! 3.0 ! 1.3 } ==AFL career== ===2018 season=== Balta with Richmond's VFL team in March 2018 Balta was drafted by with the club's third pick and the 25th selection overall in the 2017 AFL national draft. He spent the early stages of his first pre-season training as a forward, but did so on a highly limited program due to general soreness. Balta made his first appearance for Richmond when he represented the club in a series of AFLX exhibition matches in Sydney in February 2018. He began playing with the club's reserves side in VFL matches in March and kicked a goal while playing as a forward in his first match. Within three weeks he had switched role to begin playing as a defender and in April, Balta turned in what Richmond reserves coach Craig McRae labelled \\"an outstanding performance\\" in that role, contributing 23 disposals, six marks and eight rebound 50s in a win over Port Melbourne. Over the next two months of play, Balta switched regularly between roles as a forward, ruck and defender, including within individual matches. In June he was trialed for stints in the ruck, while competing predominately as a forward. Balta suffered a corked hamstring in early August and missed one VFL match as a result. After finishing as minor premiers, Richmond's reserves side lined up a home qualifying final against Williamstown in which Balta featured as a midfielder and as a forward. After a loss in that match, Richmond's reserves side suffered a knock-out loss the following week which saw the team and Balta's season come to a close. Despite showing promising signs at stages during the year, Balta finished 2018 having failed to earn an AFL debut and instead played 18 games and kicked 13 goals with the club's reserves side in the VFL. ===2019 season=== Balta during the Dreamtime at the 'G match in May 2019 Balta spent his second pre-season training as a forward and ruck and showed progress by kicking two goals in an intra-club practice in late February 2019. It was enough to earn him a berth in the club's first official pre-season match, where he contributed a \\"massive\\" second quarter performance in which he kicked two goals, took five intercept marks and recorded seven disposals on his way to a total of 18 disposals, nine inside 50s, six marks and two goals for the day. He followed that up with one more goal in the club's final pre-season match before earning a senior AFL debut in the season- opening match against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Playing as a forward and a relief ruckman, Balta managed one goal in the match, doing so with his first kick in league football. In that same match, All-Australian defender Alex Rance suffered a season-ending knee injury, leaving Balta considered as an option to replace him in the Richmond backline despite debuting as a forward. Balta was passed over for the role in round 2, but was selected to play in it in round 3 after playing as a defender in the VFL the previous week. The positional switch was not to become permanent however, with Balta regularly moved between forward, defence and the ruck across the early months of the season. Balta had a then-career best 13 disposals in round 8, forced into the role of lead ruck when Toby Nankervis went down injured midway through that win over . He bested that mark with 14 disposals against in round 9 in which he was named among Richmond's best players by The Age. For the third consecutive week, he set a new personal disposals record with 18 in round 10's Dreamtime at the 'G win over in which he also set new highs for clearances (seven) and contested possessions (16). Balta remained in the senior side through the mid-season bye including in round 13, when he shared lead ruck duties with Mabior Chol in his side's loss to . To that point he led all Rising Star eligible players for total hit outs that season despite limited game time as a ruck, while also placing fourth for inside-50s, contested possessions and contested marks among the same cohort. Following the injury return of many of the club's senior leaders post-bye, Balta was dropped back to VFL level where he played the fullback role as the team's deepest defender. He suffered a minor quad injury early in his second match back, missing most of that game as well as one further match before returning to VFL football in mid-July. Balta improved his defensive form in the weeks that followed, before being best afield in the VFL in mid-August while playing a ruck and forward role that included 18 disposals, 21 hit outs and two goals. That earned him a recall to AFL level for the final match of the home and away season, but it would prove just a one-week stint after he managed only five disposals and 10 hit outs. Balta suffered another corked thigh during that match, seeing him miss the club's first VFL final, before returning with 12 disposals in a VFL preliminary final win over Port Melbourne. Playing as a defender the following week with 11 disposals and seven marks, Balta was named by AFL Media among Richmond's best players in the VFL side that defeated to win the club's first reserves grade premiership since 1997. He also took part in AFL grand final festivities the following week, participating in and making the final of the league's Grand Final sprint. Balta finished 2019 having debuted and played 13 matches at AFL level, while also winning a VFL premiership after nine matches with the club's reserves side. ===2020 season=== In the 2019/20 off-season, Balta switched guernsey numbers, adopting the number 21 previously worn departing forward Jacob Townsend. He assumed the role left by the off-season retirement of fellow key-defender Alex Rance in the first match of the pre-season series, but was relegated to reserves level in favour of a small backline for the remainder of the series. Balta played just one VFL practice match however, after the balance of the pre-season was cancelled due to safety concerns as a result of the rapid progression of the coronavirus pandemic into Australia. Though the AFL season would start on schedule later that month, just one round of matches was played of the reduced 17-round season before the imposition of state border restrictions saw the season suspended for an indefinite hiatus. Balta took part in unofficial scratch matches against opposition reserves players when the season resumed 11 weeks later, owing to the cancellation of the VFL competition. After three such matches and following a knee injury to AFL-level key defender David Astbury, Balta was called up to senior level for round 5's match against . As with all matches that year, it was held with playing time reduced by one fifth, owing to the need to play multiple games on short breaks under a revised fixture later in the year. Despite the shortened game, Balta produced a performance that included 20 disposals, a game-high 10 intercepts and team- high 409 metres-gained and earned himself six Coaches Association award votes as the equal second best player of the match. He kept and forwards Ben Brown and Jeremy Cameron goalless during matchups over the month that followed, including after a virus outbreak in Melbourne forced the club to relocate to the Gold Coast. In late-July, coach Damien Hardwick publicly assured Balta his position, saying the club would look to play Balta and Astbury side-by-side when the latter were to make his return. Balta was equal-second-best on ground in round 9, earning four coaches votes for equal-game-high tallies in rebound-50s (five) and intercepts (nine) in a performance that had Hardwick publicly comparing him to former teammate and multi-time All-Australian Alex Rance. His next starring performance came in round 14, where he earned an equal-best on ground nine-coaches votes for a performance including 11 marks, nine intercepts and a match-sealing goal from outside 50. Following another three coaches votes against in round 15, Balta held eventual Coleman medalist Tom Hawkins to just one goal in a round 17 win over , after which he was named by AFL Media as one of the competition's most improved players in 2020. He held his spot when Astbury finally returned from injury in the season-closing round 18 win over and was rewarded for his breakout season with selection the AFL Players Association's 22Under22 team which recognises the best young players in the league. Balta contributed three marks in a qualifying final loss to the when the club's finals series campaign began in October. ==Playing style== Balta plays as a tall defender. He is notable for his psychical attributes, possessing great athletic abilities including great running power and a high leap. He played his junior years and early AFL matches as a swingman, rotating between roles as a key defender, key forward and ruck. During his breakout 2020 season, Balta drew persistent comparisons to former teammate and multi-time All-Australian fullback Alex Rance, including when All-Australian selector Glen Jakovich called Balta better than Rance at the same age. ==AFL statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of finals week 2, 2020 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2018   38  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2019   38  13  6  4  87  34  121  30  29  0.5  0.3  6.7  2.6  9.3  2.3  2.2 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2020   21  15  1  0  113  48  161  60  13  0.1  0.0  7.5  3.2  10.7  4.0  0.9 - - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 28 ! 7 ! 4 ! 200 ! 82 ! 282 ! 90 ! 42 ! 0.3 ! 0.1 ! 7.1 ! 2.9 ! 10.1 ! 3.2 ! 1.5 } Notes ==Honours and achievements== ;VFL * VFL premiership player: 2019 ;Junior * Under 18 national champion: 2017 ==Personal life== Balta's parents were both born in Australia but each is of Croatian heritage, with ties to the Split and Vukovar regions.

She is the founder of Faithless Hijabi, an international non-profit organisation that seeks to support the rights of Muslim-raised women, especially those who are in the process of leaving or have left Islam. ==Biography== Kay was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in 1992, and raised as a Khoja Twelver Shia Muslim. The languages of English, Gujarati, Swahili, and Kutchi were spoken at home, but not Arabic. Her mother was Kenyan and her father was Tanzanian. Her parents were conservative Muslims and she had four sisters and one brother. She began wearing the hijab from the age of eight, because she \\"wanted to be more pure, I wanted God to love me more.\\" In hindsight, she said \\"that's not a choice. That is coercion.\\" Aged fourteen, Kay began to question her religion, wanting to know why she couldn't be friends with non-Muslims, listen to music, loosen her hijab or not want to get married at eighteen (like some of her friends). After finishing high school at age fifteen, she moved to Malaysia to attend Sunway University and then Monash University's Malaysian campus in Bandar Sunway at age sixteen. She stopped wearing the hijab at age eighteen before she moved to Australia. After about 3¬Ω years in Malaysia, when she was nineteen, Kay moved to Australia in 2012 in order to continue her studies at the Australian campus of Monash University in Melbourne. There, she finished her bachelor's degree in information technology and her master's degree in business information systems at the age of twenty-one. Kay got a job as an engineer for an IT company in Melbourne, and then worked as a technical support engineer at Google in Sydney until 2018, the same year in which she also became an Australian citizen. She relocated to London in 2019. == Apostasy and activism== Although she began to not wear a hijab in 2011 when she was eighteen, Kay still identified as a Muslim, and said she \\"even went on pilgrimage (ziyarat)\\" to visit Shia Islamic holy sites in Iran (including Qom and Mashhad) in 2011 and Iraq in 2013. Kay renounced Islam at the age of twenty-four, because she saw the religion as incompatible with her own values: \\"I rejected a lot of Islamic values such as the punishment of gay people, inequality between genders and forced hijab.\\" Raised in a close-knit community, she says her decision to stop wearing the hijab and her eventual apostasy led to a lot of negative and hateful reactions from within her family and the wider social environment in Tanzania. After establishing boundaries, Kay and her family were able to repair a relationship, and she no longer felt threatened by community backlash. Kay was one of the guest panelists at the \\"Celebrating Dissent\\" event at De Balie in Amsterdam, where the film La√Øcit√©, Inch'Allah! (which translated into English means \\"Secularism, God willing!\\") was shown. == Faithless Hijabi == Kay founded Faithless Hijabi (FH) in 2018 in Sydney. Faithless Hijabi is a storytelling platform that enables ex-Muslim and questioning Muslim women to share their stories of apostasy, doubt and freedom. While being a platform that creates safe spaces for women to express their dissent, Faithless Hijabi strives to take an active role in advocating for women's rights. FH is active on numerous social media in order to enable people to reach out for help. At present, the organisation primarily publishes stories and blogs in English, but has recently launched their Arabic social media pages. FH's mission is \\"Educate through stories,\\" and \\"to empower an underrepresented group of women.\\" Faithless Hijabi was involved with the case of Rahaf Mohammed, the 18-year-old Saudi Arabian woman who managed to escape from her family in January 2019, but was held by Thai authorities at Bangkok Airport, after which she was able to raise international pressure via social media to allow her continue to Canada. Many of the women Faithless Hijabi help are abused, harassed, or worse, if they defy forced veiling. FH helps them find local support and mentors them to maintain boundaries and achieve financial independence. In 2020, Faithless Hijabi started sponsoring free mental health sessions for women in need. == Notes == == References == ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:21st-century atheists Category:Atheism activists Category:Australian atheists Category:Tanzanian atheists Category:Australian former Muslims Category:Australian human rights activists Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists Category:Living people Category:People from Dar es Salaam Category:Tanzanian emigrants to Australia Category:Opposition to Islam in Australia ","title":"Zara Kay"},{"id":"60290035","text":"Lisaa 3D is a 2019 Indian Tamil stereoscopic horror film written and directed by Raju Viswanath on his directorial debut.

Upon his return to Ceylon he entered politics, successfully contested a seat on the Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia Urban Council. ==Political career== In 1936 Samarakkody was elected a member of the 2nd State Council of Ceylon, for the seat of Narammala, defeating his nearest opponent by over 10,000 votes. He was one of the original members of Sinhala Maha Sabha before joining the Ceylon National Congress a few years later, where he served as the Congress' president. Samarakkody served on the Executive Committee of Local Administration, during which he acted as Minister for a short period.

It survived until 1908, after which it was the home of artist Eric Gill. It is now holiday accommodation. It was also known as Llanthony Tertia - following on from the nearby original medieval Llanthony Priory, and its Gloucestershire offshoot Llanthony Secunda - or New Llanthony Abbey. The surviving buildings are now referred to as Capel-y-ffin Monastery. ==History== === Father Ignatius === Father Ignatius of Llanthony In 1869, Joseph Leycester Lyne, self-styled \\"Father Ignatius\\", purchased of land at Capel-y-ffin in order to build an Anglican monastery near the ruins of Llanthony Priory. The cloister was begun in 1870, and the church in 1872. In 1873, J L Pearson succeeded Charles Buckeridge as architect. In 1880, Lyne's religious convictions were confirmed by visions of the Virgin Mary seen in the monastery and nearby fields by monks and local farm boys. Building stopped in 1882. The eccentric version of monastic life practiced at the abbey was observed and recorded in the diaries of Francis Kilvert. === After Lyne's death === Lyne died in Camberley on 16 October 1908, and was buried in the church at Llanthony Abbey. In his will he stated: Shortly after Lyne's death, the community - then consisting of Father Asaph, Mother Tudfil, four monks, two nuns and two sisters, elected Rev Richard Courtier-Forster, then a curate at St Giles' Church, Cambridge, to succeed Ignatius as Abbot. Receiving no objection from the Bishop of St David's, he accepted. However, shortly afterwards, Asaph Harris went to Canada to be ordained by wandering bishop Ren√© Vilatte, who had earlier ordained Lyne. When Harris returned to England, Courtier-Forster resigned, and all real hope of regularising the Llanthony Benedictines as an Anglican foundation ended.Calder-Marshall, A, 2000, The Enthusiast: An Enquiry into the Life Beliefs and Character of the Rev. Joseph Leycester Lyne Alias Fr. Ignatius, OSB Abbot of Elm Hill, Norwich and Llanthony Wales, Llanerch Press, Wales, facsimile ed. In 1911, the abbey passed into the hands of the Anglican Benedictine community of Caldey Island. The Caldey Benedictines, including Asaph Harris, collectively submitted to Rome in 1913.Anson, P.F, 1940, The Benedictines of Caldey, published by Prinknash Abbey. Harris lived until 1960 as part of the Caldey, and later Prinknash Abbey, communities.The Catholic Directory, 1961. Fr Ignatius's abbey church, which was never completed, fell into disrepair before the Gill family arrivedGill, E. 1941, Autobiography, London, Cape. and the roof was removed during the 1930s. === Eric Gill === Eric Gill (self portrait) From August 1924 to October 1928, the artist Eric Gill and his followers, associated with The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, lived in some in the former monastery.MacCarthy, F. 2003, Eric Gill, A Biography, London, Faber and Faber It was here that Gill designed the typefaces Perpetua and Gill Sans. With him was the poet and artist David Jones, who painted the local scenery.J. Miles, Eric Gill & David Jones at Capel-y-ffin, 1992 === Later use === For two years or so around 1969, the monastery was the home of the controversial Carmelite friar and writer Father Brocard Sewell, who withdrew there after he had written to The Times questioning Catholic teaching on birth control and criticising the papal encyclical Humanae Vitae; though in the end no sanction was imposed on him.Sewell, B, 1987, Frances Horovitz, a Symposium, Aylesford, Aylesford Press ‚Äì includes an account of Fr Sewell's time at Capel-y-ffin. In 1967 responsibility for upkeep of the church was transferred to a new ecumenical body, the Father Ignatius Memorial Trust, of which Sewell was a founder member. Extensive restoration work was subsequently carried out on both the surviving abbey walls and Ignatius's grave within. As the structure was fundamentally unsound, this work has been only partially successful, and as of April 2018 public access is denied. The trust also cares for a statue of the Virgin Mary commemorating her alleged apparitions at the monastery in 1880, as well as a memorial calvary opposite the site of the related ‚Äòholy bush‚Äô. A considerable collection of archives and artefacts has been assembled under the auspices of the Trust, most of which is housed at the Abergavenny Museum. The tabernacle which formerly stood on the high altar of the abbey church and various pictures are cared for by the present owners of the monastery but are not normally on view. The monastery is now holiday accommodation. The church and monastery are both grade II Cadw listed buildings. == Further reading == * New Llanthony Abbey - Hugh Allen, 2016, == References == == External links == * Capel-Y-Ffin Monastery holiday accommodation * Father Ignatius Memorial Trust * Capel-y-ffin Monastery on Coflein Category:Monasteries in Wales Category:Anglican monasteries ","title":"Llanthony Abbey"},{"id":"60290086","text":"Danny S.

Taha Malik is the music director while Danial Hyatt, son of Rohail Hyatt, provides the background score.\\"'Laal Kabootar' to hit theaters across Pakistan Friday\\" (21 March 2019), Geo News. Retrieved 24 March 2019.\\"Star- studded twin premieres for ‚ÄòLaal Kabootar‚Äô held\\" (22 March 2019), Daily Times. Retrieved 24 March 2019. The film features Ahmed Ali Akbar, Mansha Pasha, Rashid Farooqui, Raza Gillani, Syed Mohammad Ahmed, and Ali Kazmi. The film was released on 22 March 2019. Laal Kabootar's TV Premier was on 31 August 2019 on Geo Entertainment. It was Pakistan's official entry for 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. == Plot == Laal Kabootar starts off slowly but picks up pace brilliantly. When Alia‚Äôs (Mansha Pasha) husband, Noman Malik (Ali Kazmi), is murdered in a brutal target killing in Karachi, she seeks answers and revenge. Up against a lazy justice system, as well as a social structure that isn‚Äôt kind to single women, she pushes ahead in fury. Finally, she comes across Adeel (Ahmed Ali), a cab driver with his own set of troubles. Adeel‚Äôs dreams of going to Dubai aren‚Äôt materializing, even though he indulges in petty crimes. After a chance encounter with Alia, he offers to find out vital information for her, in return for a hefty sum of money. The story isn‚Äôt unlike that of many other crime films, and neatly brings together the lives of police officers, businessmen, petty thieves and murderers. However, the star of the film is Inspector Ibrahim (Rashid Farooqui), who easily switches between a loving family man and a corrupt police officer. When he tortures an informant, you curse him, but when he lets his daughter do his makeup, you absolutely fall in love with him. A police officer looks over a gate, shouting ‚ÄòOye Hello‚Äô at some criminals, and allowing them to run away. An inspector tries to wake up his wife, by pulling up her eyelids, and you laugh along as they both chuckle. Just when you think the film lacks emotional depth, you are offered the raw sadness of parents mourning their dead child, or the anxiety of a young man calming down his senile father. Meanwhile, deep in the winding lanes of a dense Karachi neighbourhood, Adeel (Ahmed Ali Akbar) tends to his aging father, drives a little red cab to make ends meet, commits petty theft and dreams of saving enough money to escape to the promised land: Dubai. Aliya and Adeel's individual scheming and planning throws them together unexpectedly. Adeel offers to help Aliya find her husband's murderer. In exchange, she'll give him enough money to flee to the UAE. Sounds simple enough... but neither of them realise they're in over their heads. What follows is threats and torment and fear, gunfights and death, difficult choices and the potential unmasking of a corrupt empire. == Cast == *Ahmed Ali Akbar as Adeel Alam *Ali Kazmi as Noman Malik *Mansha Pasha as Aaliyah Malik *Syed Mohammad Ahmed *Rashid Farooqui as Inspector Ibrahim *Mojiz Hasan *Saleem Meraj *Syed Arsalan *Hammad Sidiq *Ishtiaq Omar *Kaleem Ghour *Faiza Gillani == Production == === Filming === Laal Kabootar was filmed in Karachi.

The sensors may be used to study, monitor, or control the nerves and muscles and to remotely monitor neural activity. In practice, a medical treatment could introduce thousands of neural dust devices into human brains. The term is derived from \\"smart dust\\", as the sensors used as neural dust may also be defined by this concept. ==Background == The design for neural dust was first proposed in a 2011 paper from the University of California, Berkeley Wireless Research Center, that described both the challenges and outstanding benefits of creating a long lasting wireless brain computer interface (BCI). While the history of BCI begins with the invention of the electroencephalogram by Hans Berger in 1924, the term did not appear in scientific literature until the 1970s. The hallmark research of the field came from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), following a research grant from the National Science Foundation. While neural dust does fall under the category of BCI, it also could be used in the field of neuroprosthetics (also known as neural prosthetics). While the terms can sometimes be used interchangeably, the main difference is that while BCI generally interface neural activity directly to a computer, neuroprosthetics tend to connect activity in the central nervous system to a device meant to replace the function of a missing or impaired body part. ==Function== === Components === The principle components of the neural dust system include the sensor nodes (neural dust), which aim to be in the 10-100 ¬µm3 scale, and a sub-cranial interrogator, which would sit below the dura mater and would provide both power and a communication link to the neural dust. The neural dust motes consist of a pair of recording electrodes, a custom transistor, and a piezoelectric sensor. The piezoelectric crystal is capable of recording brain activity from the extracellular space, and converting it into an electrical signal. === Data and Power Transfer === While many forms of BCI exist, neural dust is in a class of its own due to its size, wireless capability, and use of ultrasound technology. While many comparable devices use electromagnetic waves (such as radio frequencies) to interact with wireless neural sensors, use of ultrasound offers the advantages of higher spatial resolution as well as decreased attenuation in the tissue. This results in higher penetration depths (and therefore easier communication with the sub-cranial communicator), as well as reduced unwanted energy being distributed into the body's tissues due to scattering or absorption. This excess energy would take the form of heat, which would cause damage to the surrounding tissue. Use of ultrasound also permits greater scaling of sensor nodes, allowing for sizes less than 100 ¬µm, which provides great possibility in the realm of implantable electronics. ==== Backscatter Communication ==== Due to the extremely small size of the neural dust motes, it would be impractical and nearly impossible to create a functional transmitter in the sensor itself. Thus backscatter communication, adopted from radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies, is employed. In RFID passive, battery-less tags are capable of absorbing and reflecting radio frequency (RF) energy when in close proximity to a RF interrogator, which is a device that transmits RF energy. As they reflect the RF energy back to the interrogator, they are capable of modulating the frequency, and in doing so, encoding information. Neural dust employs this method by having the sub-dural communicator send out an ultrasound pulse that is then reflected by the neural dust sensors. The piezoelectric crystal detects the neuronal signal from its location in the extracellular space, and the ultrasound energy reflected back to the interrogator would be modulated in a way that would communicate the recorded activity. In one proposed model of the neural dust sensor, the transistor model allowed for a method of separating between local field potentials and action potential \\"spikes\\", which would allow for a greatly diversified wealth of data acquirable from the recordings. ==Clinical and health applications== === Neural prosthetics === Some examples of neural prostheses include cochlear implants that can aid in restoring hearing, artificial silicon retina microchips that have shown to be effective in treating retinal degeneration from retinitis pigmentosa, and even motor prostheses that could offer the capability for movement in those affected with quadriplegia or disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The use of neural dust in conjunction with motor prostheses could allow for a much finer control of movement === Electrostimulation === While methods of electrical stimulation of nerves and brain tissue have already been employed for some time, the size and wireless nature of neural dust allows for advancement in clinical applications of the technique. Importantly, because traditional methods of neurostimulation and certain forms of nerve stimulation such as spinal cord stimulation use implanted electrodes that remain connected to wires, the risk of infection and scarring is high. While these risks are not a factor in the use of neural dust, the challenge of applying sufficient electrical current to the sensor node, is still present. ====Sleep Apnea==== Electrostimulation devices have already shown some efficacy in treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Researchers that used a surgically implanted electrostimulation device on patients with severe OSA found significant improvement over a 12-month period of treatment with the device.Strollo, P.

A paramount goal of the American Epilepsy Society is the continued development of automated brain electrical stimulation (also known as contingent, or closed loop stimulation), which provides seizure-halting electrical stimulation based on brain patterns that indicate a seizure is about to happen. This provides a much better treatment of the disorder than stimulation that is based on an estimate of when the seizure might occur. While vagal nerve stimulation is often a target area for treatment of epileptic seizures, there has been research into the efficacy of stimulation in the hippocampus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus.

Set in 1585 and 1586 during the French Wars of Religion, it is the third and final work in his Valois trilogy, concluding the events of La Reine Margot and La Dame de Monsoreau. It opens thirteen years after the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre and ten years into the reign of Henry III of France as he tries to calm the religious and political intrigues dividing the kingdom. Dumas fictionalises the action, including Henry of Navarre's capture of Cahors (which actually occurred in 1580) and the attack on Antwerp (redated by Dumas from 1583 to 1585 or 1586) and including William the Silent (who had actually been assassinated in 1584) and the Duke of Anjou (who historically died of TB in 1584 but who Dumas shows being encouraged to covet the crown of the Low Countries by William and fulfilling a prediction by C√¥me Ruggieri in La Reine Margot). He also makes count Henri du Bouchage's retreat from the world to become a Capuchin friar a result of the coldness of Diane de M√©ridor, whereas historically he did so from grief for his wife's death. ==Sources== *Gustave Baguenault de Puchesse, ¬´ Les Quarante-cinq ¬ª, in Revue du seizi√®me si√®cle, t.

Shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages, the film features Havish, Rahman, Nandita Swetha and Regina Cassandra in lead roles. ==Summary== While investigating an enigmatic man named Karthik, a police officer is bewildered by the conflicting statements about his identity. Three young women seem to share a mysterious connection with him and claim Karthik as their husband who has gone missing a few days/months before. An old man from an asylum claims that he knew Karthik as Krishnamurthy, who had died thirty years ago. The next day the old man was found killed. After the old man's death, another woman called Priya appears and claims Karthik as her husband, who has been missing since the previous day. The police officers are in shock with her claim because they had arrested Karthik two days before as the suspect of the old man's murder. During the investigation, Karthik fails to recognize the other three women who claimed him as their husband. In the next scene the woman is brought to the imprisoned Karthik. When she sees Karthik, they both smile at each other and suddenly the woman pulls a gun and shoots him. The police officer stops her act and asks her intention for doing thus. She reveals her love story and marriage with Karthik. After her marriage, due to some misunderstanding Karthik leaves her, after a few months she reads news about Karthik and the affairs he had with other three women (who claimed Karthik as their husband in the first half of the story). She was shocked with the news and assumed that Karthik is a playboy who had spoiled four women's lives (including hers) so, she decides that he is not fit to live. Karthik escapes from the hospital and with the help of a journalist he goes in search of those girls to know their intention to cause such trouble in his life. There he finds all the allegations given towards him are false as they have staged a drama against Karthik on the request of Saraswati, an old lady. Sarswati, the woman behind the scene is the main culprit who saves those girls from getting raped which was staged by herself as she wanted the help of those girls to trouble Karthik for revenge. This lady is shown to be Karthik's father's ex-wife who kills her father and stages a drama to marry Krishnamoorthy (father of Karthik). On their nuptial night, Krishnamurthy realizes that Saraswati has psychotic behavior and the murderer of her father and Krishnamoorthy's fianc√©e Bhanu's family. He escapes and jumps into a river. Saraswati is sent to an asylum and released after a few years. She sees Krishnamoorthy living a happy life with Bhanu and two children. She kills them on the same day except the son who turned out to be Karthik. At present, she still hallucinates Karthik for Krishnamoorthi and wants to kill him as a revenge for rejecting her. She kidnaps Priya the wife of Karthik and threatens him at gunpoint telling him to kill himself.In an attempt to save Karthik,ACP Vijay Prakash gets injured. The police shoot her in her leg and she finally shoots herself without letting them know the hideout of Priya. Finally Karthik and the police find Priya at the basement and she apologises for misunderstanding Karthik and they reunite. ==Cast== * Havish as Karthik/Krishnamurthy * Rahman as Vijay Prakash * Regina Cassandra as Saraswathi * Nandita Swetha as Ramya * Anisha Ambrose as Jenny * Tridha Choudhury as Priya * Pujita Ponnada as Bhanu * Aditi Arya as Abhinaya * Vidyullekha Raman as Karthik's coworker * Kishore Rajkumar as Karthik's coworker (Tamil version) * Satya as a journalist ==Production== The film started production as a Telugu film, but the film became bilingual after producer M.

In Cincinnati after the Civil War, he was for many years Secretary of the Board of Hebrew Union College. He was a charter member of B'nai B'rith, the first national Jewish organization in the United States. According to his son Moses, he was a good writer and a well-read man, \\"a man of cultivation\\", who possessed the complete works of Maimonides. He was the father of Moses Jacob Ezekiel (1844‚Äì1917), who became America's most famous sculptor. Jacob's grandfather, Eleazar Joseph Israel, was a sofer (Jewish scribe); a Torah he copied is owned by synagogue Mikveh Israel, in Philadelphia. His Ashkenazic parents, Ezekiel Jacob Ezekiel and Hannah Rebecca Israel, came from Amsterdam, Holland (a Sephardic center), to Philadelphia; Jacob was born there two years later. Joseph had an elder sister, Martha, born in Holland, and a younger sister Adeline. His mother died when he was six, and he continued growing under the care of his uncle, Michael E. Cohen, who had a family board him. At age thirteen he started a seven-year apprenticeship as a bookbinder. The apprenticeship completed, he set up a book-binding business in Baltimore (1833‚Äì34), where he founded the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Baltimore. In 1834 he moved to Richmond, following his father, who had already moved there. ==In Richmond== In Richmond, on June 10, 1835, he married Catherine Myers Castro (February 28, 1819 ‚Äì July 11, 1891), a Sephardic Jew born in Amsterdam, Holland, who came to the United States only four years previously, at the age of twelve. He entered the dry-goods business at 41 Main Street with first one, then another brother-in-law; then he was in the business alone. According to his son Moses, \\"My father was so very good-hearted that he ruined himself by signing bonds for some of his relatives who afterwards failed in business. That reduced my parents to absolute poverty for a long time.\\" As a result of his financial situation, his son Moses grew up living with Jacob's parents, Moses' grandparents. The dry-goods store sold, among other things, suits and women's dresses for slaves about to be sold. Jacob and his wife also owned a few slaves; Census records show that in 1850 Jacob owned a female of 55 and four males (69, 19, 12, 11), but none in 1860. He also was a cotton merchant. Shortly after his arrival he was elected Secretary of Richmond's first synagogue, Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalome, \\"The Congregation of the House of Peace\\", which was Sephardic. Later becoming Treasurer as well, he held that office until his departure from Richmond thirty years later. He was one of the organizers of annual balls \\"in aid of a Hebrew school fund\\", the first one of which was in 1847. He was a trustee of the \\"Hebrew and English Institute of the City of Richmond\\", incorporated in 1848 but closed three years later \\"for want of proper patronage\\". He was also a trustee of the \\"Hebrew Beneficial Society\\" of Richmond, chartered in 1851. In short, Jacob was \\"spokesman of the Jews of Richmond\\"; \\"he was prominently identified in all matters of Jewish interest\\" in Richmond. It is from his article \\"The Jews of Richmond\\" that we learn of their early history, since, as he tells us, records were lost in the Richmond fire of 1864. It was through his newspaper articles and other activities that a local ordinance prohibiting the breaking of Sabbath on Sunday was repealed; in 1849 \\"he had the state law so emended as to absolve those citizens who observed the Jewish Sabbath from any penalty for violating the Christian Sabbath\\". \\"In 1849 Ezekiel secured the enactment of a law by which religious organizations were invested with the rights of incorporated institutions.\\" Jacob received national publicity for two other incidents: he objected when President Tyler referred to the citizens of the United States as a \\"Christian people\\"; Tyler apologized. Also, he spoke out \\"effectively\\" against a treaty with Switzerland, preventing its ratification, and against accepting a block of Swiss granite for the Washington Monument, because of Swiss anti-Semitism. Jacob's \\"business houses having been burnt\\", he found it advisable to leave Richmond. His last known advertisement for his business appeared in the January 27, 1867, issue of the Richmond Dispatch. In December 1867 he was a delegate representing Richmond in the Conservative Convention of Virginia, \\"the Convention of the white people of Virginia, who are the people of Virginia\\", whose stated \\"object\\" was \\"to organize a white man's party\\". On April 8, 1868, the family moved as a group to Cincinnati, where his daughter Hannah Workum, wife of wealthy businessman Levi J. Workum, in the wholesale liquor business, had been living for some years. (According to obituaries, Workum was \\"a model citizen\\" and \\"a liberal donor\\" to the Hebrew Union College; \\"his private benefactions were large\\".) ==In Cincinnati== Cincinnati at the time of Jacob's move there (1868) was the intellectual capital of American Judaism. Seat of the oldest Jewish congregation west of the Appalachian Mountains, in number of Jews it was second only to New York City. The first Jewish Hospital was there. The second Jewish newspaper in the history of the United States, The Israelite, had been published there since 1854. (The Asmonean, 1849‚Äì1858, was the first.) A Jewish printer, to become Bloch Publishing, was there as well. Efforts to create an association of all synagogues were centered there, and in 1873 the Union of American Hebrew Congregations came into existence. Finally, efforts were underway to create a Jewish university, including a rabbinical school; Hebrew Union College opened in 1875. The Manischevitz Company, which automated the manufacture of matzos and made them square, came slightly later, in 1888, and in 1889 the Central Conference of American Rabbis. From the beginning, the College solicited book donations, and it soon owned the largest collection of Jewish books in the world, today (2019) surpassed only by the National Library of Israel. There is a fourteen-page printed catalog of the books Ezekiel donated to the college in 1892. At the center of this activity was America's most famous and controversial rabbi of the day, Isaac Meyer Wise, who was founder and editor of The Israelite and rabbi of the B'nai Yeshurun congregation from 1854 until his death in 1900. Ezekiel had written to Wise in 1855, expressing an interest in Wise's new and unsuccessful Zion Collegiate Institute project, \\"a university on the German model with a Jewish theological faculty\\". After moving to Cincinnati, Ezekiel became Secretary of the Board and Treasurer of Hebrew Union College, the new institution, fulfilling the functions of registrar, from its inception almost until his death. In Cincinnati, Ezekiel again worked in the dry-goods business, according to the 1870 Census. He became a member of the Kahal Kadosh Bene (or Benai) Israel, whose rabbi was Max Lilienthal, \\"Corresponding Editor\\" of The Israelite. At the time of his golden wedding anniversary in 1885, his residence was described as \\"palatial\\". He had thirteen living children, thirty-nine grandchildren, and one great- grandchild. In an editorial after his death, Wise said: > He was one of the very few men I have ever known whose presence in itself > was a beneficence. He had merely to live; that in itself brought sunshine > into the world of his associates. Even a transient meeting with him made men > feel there is good in mankind. I never met him without being the better for > it, and his kindly greeting and genial smile were always to me like a > benison [blessing] from one I loved. A more gracious presence, and a more > lovable nature have seldom been combined. His goodness made itself > intuitively felt; and he had not even to speak, for his purity of heart and > sincerity of mind seemed fairly to beam from his eyes. There may have been > better men than Jacob Ezekiel, I presume he had his share of human > frailties; but, I have never yet met another who could so impress the > hallowing influence which true goodness inspires. His life was beautiful, > and all who knew him are the better for that knowledge. Such a man does not > die, as the world is forever brighter and better because of the life he > lived in it. ==Writings== * * ==Archival material== The American Jewish Archives, in Cincinnati, contains \\"Correspondence and scrapbooks covering the activities of Jacob Ezekiel and family.

In October, an offer from Division One club Falkirk for Mulhall's services was rejected \\"as neither the club nor the player wished any change.\\" There was also interest from other league clubs including Morton, and the Sunday Post called him \\"the most-wanted man in Third League football\\" and reported that comparisons had been made with Bobby Walker, the quick-footed former Hearts and Scotland forward. Within weeks, Mulhall decided he did wish a change after all and was back in England on trial with Brighton and Hove Albion of the Third Division South. Brighton signed Mulhall for a fee of ¬£225, of which a portion went to the player. He made his debut on 6 December 1924 in a goalless draw with Reading, appeared once more in another goalless draw, and was placed in the reserves. After five goals in his first two outings, he faded; reported to be suffering \\"acute homesickness\\", he returned to Scotland. He joined Falkirk ahead of the 1925‚Äì26 season, and \\"played his way into the first eleven\\", but was not retained. According to the Falkirk Herald, some would find his departure a matter for regret, as \\"he played many fine games for Falkirk last season, but his lack of inches was a handicap and sometimes he was inclined to spoil good work by clinging too long to the ball.\\" Mulhall returned to Dykehead for the 1926‚Äì27 season in the Scottish Football Alliance, the Third Division having folded, and then spent time with Fauldhouse United of the Scottish Intermediate League. In August 1928, Mulhall went to the United States where he signed for Bethlehem Steel, who were then playing in the American Soccer League (ASL). He played just once before his club left the ASL and became a founder member of the breakaway Eastern Professional Soccer League (ESL) in a dispute over jurisdiction, dubbed the Soccer War. After two appearances in the new league, Mulhall was loaned to another ESL team, Newark Skeeters, for which he played six matches and scored once before being recalled. A dislocated arm kept him out for some weeks, and he finished the season with five goals from eleven ESL matches. ==References== Category:1902 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Shotts Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Dykehead F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Fauldhouse United F.C. players Category:Bethlehem Steel F.C.

Exposed to folk culture as a child, he studied history and culture in Ahmedabad. He has written and edited more than 90 works on folk culture, folk literature, and folk arts. He established the Gujarat Lok Kala Foundation for the promotion of folk arts. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2019. ==Early life== Jadav was born on 10 January 1940 in Akru village near Dhandhuka (now in Ahmedabad district, Gujarat) to a Rajput farmer family. His parents were Danubhai Halubhai Jadav and Pamba. He was the second of six children. He was raised by his stepmother, Gangaba. He was exposed to folk literature and folk arts as a child due to his living in a rural area. He received his primary school education in his village and in Sheth Hasanali High School in Dholka. He received his secondary school education from Gujarat Vidyapith in 1956‚Äì57. In 1961, he completed his bachelor of arts degree in Gujarati language and History at St. Xavier's College, Ahmedabad. Jadav had found the remains of a Late Harappan site on a mound near the Khalavi lake near his native village of Akru. This whetted his interest in archaeology and history, and he completed his master of arts in Ancient Indian Culture at the Bholabhai Jeshingbhai Institute of Learning and Research, Ahmedabad, in 1963. His interests in folk literature, folk culture, and folk arts developed further during these years. ==Career== After completing his master's degree, he became a teacher of Gujarati at Panchsheel High School in Saraspur, Ahmedabad. He left and joined St. Xavier's College as a part-time lecturer. In 1964, he joined the Sahkar weekly published by the Gujarat State Co-operative Union as a publication officer. He was later promoted to the post of chief executive officer in 1994 and served there until his retirement in 1998. He also edited and published the Gramswaraj monthly and edited the Jinmangal monthly. Jadav popularised folk arts and patronised folk artists by promoting them on various mass media sites, including television and radio. In 1978, he established the Gujarat Lok Kala Foundation for the promotion of the folk arts and to give folk artists from Gujarat and Rajasthan wider exposure and employment. The Foundation provided a platform for folk artists at the national and international levels. == Works == As of 2019, Jadav has written and edited 94 works on folk literature, folk culture, and folk arts. Since 1958, his articles on folk literature and folk arts have been published in various magazines and dailies, including Buddhiprakash, Nutan Gujarat, Rang Tarang, Akhand Anand, Sandesh, and Gujarat Samachar.

His collections of children's stories include Bhatigal Lokkathao (1973) and Manoranjak Kathamala (1977). His reference works on folk literature and arts include Aapna Kasabio (1972), Lokjivanna Moti (1975), Gujaratni Loksanskriti (1976), Loksanskritina Pashuo (1979), and Prachin Bharatna Shastrashastro (1981). For Gujarati Loksahityamala (Gujarati Folk Literature Series), he edited folk songs from the Bhal region. He has edited several works of folk literature, including Saje Dharati Shangar (1972), Loksahityani Nagkathao (1973), and Gujaratni Lokkathao (1984). ==Recognition== Jadav was awarded the Meghani Suvarna Chandrak in 1978 by the Loksanskriti Sodh Sansthan for his work Lokjivanna Moti.

Alongside with her prominent predecessors -Umm al- Darda and Fatima bint 'Abd al- Malik ibn Marwan, wife of the pious caliph 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, she is represents what Mohammad Akram Nadwi terms as hadith scholarship from al-Sham (Greater Syria).Nadwi, M. A. (2007). al- Muhaddithat: the Women Scholars in Islam. Interface Publications:London, p.266 ==The honorable title 'sitt'== It must be noted that Arabic word sitt does not signify the personal name. It means a respectful greeting as lady usually attributed to the female rules or to women with some exceptional talents in the sciences. For example, queen of the Fatimid dynasty of Egypt in 980 bore the title Sitt al-Mulk. Sitt al-Qudat ( literally, chief of qadis, or judge) was a female expert in hadith and fiqh, and lived in Damascus in 14th century. Also, Sitt al-'Arab an Sitt al-'Ajam other eminent experts in hadiths lived in the same century. Mernissi, F. (1993) The Forgotten Queens of Islam. Polity Press:UK, pp. 19-20. Apropos, in another sourceIbn Hajar, al-Durar al-kaminah, ii.129 she is called with a longer name Sitt al-Wuzara' bint 'Umar ibn al- Munajja that means she is a daughter of 'Umar who is son of al-Munajja. == Scholarship == === Transmitions of the hadiths from Sahih Al-Bukhari === An exceptional devotion, steadfastness and stamina in the teaching has been exercised by Sitt al-Wuzara. She was widely known in Damascus for teaching Sahih Al-Bukhari, the authentic collection of the hadiths (included over 7000 hadiths unanimously accepted by Muslim scholars of his time).Alkhateeb, F. (2014). Lost Islamic History. Reclaiming Muslim Civilization from the Past. Hurst & Company: London, p.67 Evidence of her high role in narrating hadiths is shown in the main title on the ornamented title page of Sahih al-Bukhari (dated 8th century), which stated that narration of al-Firabri, the isnad (the chain of the transmitters of the hadiths) of Sitt al-Wuzara'. In other words, the narrator heard the chain of the transmitters along with the hadiths from Sitt al-Wuzara'.Ibn Azuz, Juhud al-mar'ah al-Dimashqiyyah fi riwayat hadith sharif, 275. MS, Maktabah al-Wazir Kubrili, no.362 Nadwi in Al-Muhaddithat: the Women Scholars in Islam underlined an interesting coincidence regarding Sitt al-Wuzara' that she was the last women in the world who had narrated the hadiths from Sahih Al-Bukhari from Al-Zadibi and died in 716 and Aishah bint Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Hadi al-Maqdisiyyah, who died one hundred years later, had even above this quality that even among men no one reached this level Nadwi, M.

Al-Muhaddithat: the Women Scholars in IslamInterface Publications: London, p.105 ==Long-lasting legacy== Throughout her life Sitt al-Wuzara' had a plenty of students, among whom the ordinary and noble men were found. She lived more than ninety years. And as it was reported by Ibn Kathir, she was teaching until the last breath, the last day of her long life.

His undergraduate education began in 1938 when he enrolled to study natural sciences at Charles University. His studies were interrupted the following year when universities were shuttered under the German occupation. Working under the supervision of at Bulovka Hospital, and in a rudimentary laboratory in the basement of his parental home, he discovered a polarographic method of measuring fast chemical reactions. He was awarded a doctorate for this research when Charles University reopened in 1945. In 1943, he joined a research group at the Fragner pharmaceutical company near Prague that was working to develop a penicillin variant. Despite working in secrecy and isolation under onerous wartime restrictions, the group managed to first separate and then test an antimicrobial drug. Wiesner's role included ensuring an adequate supply of the antibiotic by extracting and purifying the substance from the test subject's urine following treatment. From 1946 until 1948 he conducted postgraduate research in organic chemistry under Vladimir Prelog at ETH, Z√ºrich, funded by a Rockefeller fellowship. Wiesner immigrated to Canada in 1948 to take up a position at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton. Apart from a two-year spell with the pharmaceutical company Ayerst in Montreal, he remained at UNB for the remainder of his career. He died of lymphoma in 1986. ==Scientific achievements== Wiesner made remarkable contributions to the structural and synthetic chemistry of complex polysubstituted polycyclic natural products. In the 1950s, prior to the development of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, he determined the structure of several diterpene alkaloids including veatchine, atisine, annotinine, delphinine, aconitine, and songorine. After returning to New Brunswick from Ayerst in 1964, he began a successful program to synthesize these compounds, culminating in the total synthesis of chasmanine and napelline. Towards the end of the 1970s Wiesner turned his attention to digitalis derivatives, with the goal of finding cardiac glycosides with safer therapeutic ratios. In the last decade of his career he succeeded in demonstrating the separation of the inotropic and toxic properties of this group of compounds, elucidated the underlying chemical mechanism, and finally achieved the total synthesis of digitoxin and other cardioactive steroids. ==Honors and awards== Wiesner received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1952, the Chemical Institute of Canada's Palladium Medal in 1963, the Royal Society of Chemistry's Centenary Prize in 1976, the American Chemical Society's Ernest Guenther Award in 1983, and the Izaak Walton Killam Memorial Prize in 1986. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1957, to the Royal Society in 1969, and admitted to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1978. He was awarded the Order of Canada on June 25, 1975. He also received the Marin Drinov Medal of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Officers of the Order of Canada Category:1919 births Category:1986 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian scientists Category:Canadian chemists Category:Organic chemists Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian people of Czech descent Category:University of New Brunswick faculty Category:Charles University alumni Category:Czech chemists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences Category:People from Prague ","title":"Karel Wiesner"},{"id":"60290785","text":"Anterior longitudinal approach. An arrow parallel to the long axis of the transducer is drawn on the skin adjacent to the end of transducer where the needle will be introduced. Ultrasound-guided hip joint injection is a joint injection in the hip, assisted by medical ultrasound. Hip and groin pain often presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The differential diagnosis is extensive, comprising intra-articular and extra-articular pathology and referred pain from lumbar spine, knee and elsewhere in the pelvis. Various ultrasound-guided techniques have been described in the hip and groin region for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Ultrasound has many advantages over other imaging modalities, including portability, lack of ionizing radiation and real-time visualization of soft tissues and neurovascular structures. Many studies have demonstrated the safety, accuracy and efficacy of ultrasound- guided techniqueshttps://www.edm-us.com/2018/06/28/ultrasound-guidance- techniques/, although there is lack of standardization regarding the injectates used and long-term benefit remains uncertain.Initially largely copied from: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0) ==Introduction== The hip and groin are sites of multiple injuries and inflammatory conditions, including intra-articular and extra-articular pathology, giving rise to an extensive differential diagnosis for hip and groin pain. Pain originating from different anatomical areas such as lumbar spine, knee and pelvis can also be referred to the hip and groin. Often, patients with hip conditions have concomitant knee or spine conditions, which may present difficult therapeutic and diagnostic dilemmas. Given the complexity of hip and groin anatomy and clinical conditions, imaging-guided injections are useful both for the diagnostic workup and treatment. The main advantages of ultrasound-guided injection are its safety, portability and lack of ionising radiation. Injectates can include corticosteroid, local anaesthetic, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), viscosupplement and dextrose prolotherapy. The total volume injected is usually 6‚Äì7ml. ==General principles for ultrasound-guided injection== Usual standards for musculoskeletal interventional procedures apply include review of previous imaging, informed consent and appropriate local anesthetic. The use of a high-frequency (> 10 MHz) linear array transducer is recommended, but lower-frequency curvilinear probes may be occasionally required to visualize deep structures in larger patients. A preliminary diagnostic sonographic examination, including color Doppler of the area to be punctured is necessary to define the relationship of adjacent neurovascular structures.Initially largely copied from: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0) Injections should be performed with adherence to aseptic technique although this varies between institutions and radiologists attributable to resources, training, perceived risk and experience. In a survey of 250 health professionals in the United Kingdom, 43.5% believed infection rates were < 1/1000 following intra- articular injections, 33.0% perceived rates were < 1/100, and 2.6% perceived the risk as negligible. Sterile preparation of the entire injection field, including adjacent skin where the gel and probe are applied, is recommended. Areas of superficial infection such as cellulitis or abscess should be avoided to prevent deeper spread. Before sterile preparation, the procedure often begins with a preliminary sonography in order to determine a safe route of access. At this point, an evaluate may also be performed over the joint area for any joint effusion, or any thickening or hyperemia of the joint capsule. A line parallel to the long axis of the transducer can be drawn on the skin adjacent to the end of transducer in order to mark where the needle will be introduced. Once the patient‚Äôs skin is sterilized and initial needle entry is made adjacent to the mark, the probe can be returned quickly to the same location and orientation by aligning to the skin mark. The needle is directed toward the intended target by a freehand technique. The needle size, length and type should be selected based on the site, depth and patient‚Äôs body habitus. 22‚Äì24G needles are sufficed for most injections. The risk of clinically significant bleeding is minimal, so coagulation tests are not needed before the procedure. It can for example be performed during chronic warfarin therapy with therapeutic coagulation levels. ==Anatomy== The hip joint is a ball-and-socket synovial joint, formed by an articulation between the femur and acetabulum. Intra-articular etiology of hip pain includes osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthropathy, acetabular labral tears and femoro- acetabular impingement. Injection of short and long acting anesthetic agents can be useful in confirming hip pathology and differentiating asymptomatic intra-articular pathology from extra-articular conditions that may be the source of symptoms. Complete relief of hip pain following intra-articular injection of local anaesthetic is associated with good surgical outcome following joint replacement. ==Injection approach== Anterior longitudinal approach. The needle is introduced from an inferior and anterior approach, lateral to the femoral neurovascular bundle (arrow). A, acetabulum; H, femoral head; N, femoral neck; double arrow ‚Äì anterior joint recess. Two common anterior approaches are typically used both with the patient lying supine: *The anterior longitudinal approach: the probe is aligned along the long axis of the femoral neck. The needle is introduced from an anteroinferior approach and is passed into the anterior joint recess at the femoral head-neck junction. Anterolateral approach, here shown as a transverse image. The needle will rest on the femoral head (arrow). A, acetabulum; H, femoral head; N, femoral neck; LAT, lateral; MED, medial. *The anterolateral approach, with the ultrasound probe oriented axially and the femoral head and acetabular rim in view. This often shortens the distance from needle skin entry to joint compared to the longitudinal approach making it a useful approach in larger patients. The introduced needle remains lateral to the femoral neurovascular bundle, and the needle is advanced until its tip rests on the femoral head. ==Comparison to other methods== Initial treatment options include activity modification, analgesia and physical therapy. When symptoms persist despite these measures, hip injections can be considered. Intra-articular hip injections can be technically challenging due to depth, variable body habitus, and the proximity to the femoral neurovascular bundle. Image guidance is therefore advocated to ensure safe and accurate needle placement. Fluoroscopic-guidance was the mainstay imaging-guidance hip injection, but ultrasound-guidance is becoming increasingly prevalent due to its accuracy with visualization of soft tissue and neurovascular structures, less associated cost and no ionizing radiation exposure or risk of contrast agent reactions. A position statement by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine reviewed the literature and found several level one studies of ultrasound guided hip injections with a mean accuracy of 99%. In addition, a recent meta-analysis revealed that ultrasound-guided hip joint injections were significantly more accurate than landmark-guided intra-articular hip injections (accuracies were 100%, 95%CI 98‚Äì100%; 72%, 95%CI 56‚Äì85%, respectively). To date, many trials examining efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for osteoarthritis, either under fluoroscopy or ultrasound-guidance, have revealed short-term improvement of hip pain, though no reliable predictors of response to intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been identified. While it has been shown that no significant difference in terms of effectiveness between fluoroscopy and ultrasound-guided corticosteroid hip injection, it has been reported that ultrasound-guided injections were less painful and preferred by patients. ==Injectates in osteoarthritis== For pain relief in osteoarthritis, the injectate may be for example: *Local anesthetic :*25mg bupivacaine (such as 5ml of Marcaine 0.5%) *Glucocorticoid, for example: :*40mg triamcinolone (such as 1ml of 40 mg/ml) ==Efficacy in osteoarthritis== In osteoarthritis, joint injection of glucocorticoids leads to short term pain relief, with onset after 2 to 7 days, Review Date 11/27/2016 that may last between a few weeks and a few months. A local anesthetic reduces pain from 15 to 20 minutes after the injection, and lasts about 4 to 6 hours. Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. ==References== Category:Hip ","title":"Ultrasound-guided hip joint injection"},{"id":"60290787","text":"Kim Nung-o (, born in the late 1960s) is a North Korean politician.

She attended Queen's College at Cambridge University where she studied History. She subsequently completed a Master of Arts at London's School of Oriental and African Studies in Postcolonial Studies. Her thesis focused on how Muslims, particularly Pakistanis like herself, are targets of the British surveillance state. == Work == Manzoor-Khan has contributed to and written for several news outlets, including The Independent, 5PillarsUK.com, New Internationalist, Amaliah.com, Al-Jazeera and Sister-hood. She has appeared on radio stations including BBC Radio 4, BBC Asian Network, the Muslim Vibe and Wandsworth Radio's She Speaks with Katy Davis. She has her own blog, thebrownhijabi, which she regularly updates with articles, blogposts, media appearances and podcasts. She has also appeared in features for Middle East Eye, The Guardian and HuffPost. She mostly focuses on Islamophobia, decolonisation, religion, politics, gender and race in her writing and performances. == Poetry slam == In 2017, Manzoor-Khan performed at The Last Word Festival in London's Roundhouse Poetry Slam, winning the competition with her poem \\"This is not a Humanising Poem\\". Her performance of the poem, which spoke about how the world values Muslims based on how 'good' or 'bad' they are considered to be, went viral after being posted on the Roundhouse's Facebook page. Her performance has since been viewed more than 2 million times online. == 2018 and later == Following her performance at The Last Word Festival, Manzoor-Khan received more publicity and opportunities to showcase her work. Describing the period since her performance, she has said, \\"That sort of publicity was something I couldn't have imagined and it's given me opportunities to genuinely pursue this as an art form.\\" She returned to The Last Word Festival in 2018 with her performance entitled \\"LOL, Inshaallah\\". The performance is based on Manzoor-Khan's experiences and insights into the complexities and challenges British Muslim women often face. In April 2018, Manzoor-Khan joined a group of female playwrights to create a series of plays to be distributed free of charge to the public. The plays centered around the theme of female empowerment and movements. In August 2018, she appeared in a video for The Guardian, titled \\"One person can matter\\", in which she provided viewers with five ways they could fight for their cause and stay motivated in the process. The feature was part of a takeover of the Weekend issue by guest editors from Gal-dem. In December 2018, she was a panellist for a discussion on how heritage and gender can impact writers' work, held by British Asian Women Writers in the North. In January 2019. Manzoor-Khan published the book A FLY Girl's Guide to University with co-authors Lola Olufemi, Odelia Younge and Waithera Sebatindira. The book focused on their experiences being women of colour at the University of Cambridge; the title refers to FLY, the university's network for women and non-binary people of colour. In February 2019, Manzoor-Khan appeared in a video for Middle East Eye titled \\"Citizenship can be weaponised\\" in which she addresses the potential repercussions of the government decision to revoke Shamima Begum's British citizenship. In September 2019, Manzoor-Khan published her first poetry collection, Postcolonial Banter, with Verve Poetry Press. == TEDx Talks == In 2017, Manzoor-Khan was a speaker at the TEDxYouth@Brum event in Birmingham where she performed a poem titled \\"Funeral of the Authentic Muslim Woman\\", in which she rejects the idea \\"that there is only one way to be a Muslim woman,\\" highlighting the complexities and contradictions that exist within everyone, including Muslim women. In 2018, she gave a speech at TEDxCoventGardenWomen in London titled \\"I'm Bored of Talking about Muslim Women\\". In her speech, she asked the audience, \\"Why are we so fascinated with Muslim women at all?\\" She continued by saying, \\"The usual conversations about Muslim women focus on what we wear, our bodies and our behaviour, seeing us mainly as victims of sexism,\\" and explaining that such narratives are rarely helpful for Muslim women.

The union brought together small miners' unions based in Bradley, Coseley, Oldbury, Tipton and West Bromwich, the oldest of which had been founded in either 1860 or 1863. It was established in 1869 as the West Bromwich, Oldbury, Tipton, Coseley and Bradley Amalgamated Association of Miners, linked with the new, national, Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM), but was usually known by the shorter title of the \\"West Bromwich Miners' Association\\". During this period, George Henry Rowlinson served twice as president of the union. The union's membership peaked at 3,105 in 1875, but it only just survived the collapse of the national AAM, membership falling to only 515 in 1881. An 1884 strike involving miners in many of the unions based in the West Midlands brought the union close to collapse. However, Samuel Henry Whitehouse became the union's agent, and in 1886 it became a founder constituent of the Midland Counties Miners' Federation, with Whitehouse becoming the federation's first secretary. The union saw a resurgence in membership, but Whitehouse left in 1888 and was replaced by Henry Rust, who withdrew the union from the federation, and also kept it outside the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). Initially this strategy proved successful, membership reaching 2,218 again by 1892, but by 1898 it was struggling. The union was renamed as the South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire Amalgamated Association of Miners, and Thomas Mansell took over as secretary. In 1899, he brought the union back into the Midland Federation, and through it, also into membership of the MFGB. Membership peaked during World War I, hitting 4,210 in 1915, but then fell rapidly, declining to 1,031 in 1920. ==General Secretaries== :1870s: Henry Barnes :1880s: Samuel Henry Whitehouse :1888: Henry Rust :1898: Thomas Mansell :1910s: H.

The company owns Swedish commercial broadcaster TV4 AB, Finnish commercial broadcaster MTV Oy, and pan-Nordic premium television channel operator C More Entertainment. The company was formed as Bonnier Broadcasting AB in 2016 to serve as a holding company of broadcasting businesses then-owned by Bonnier ‚Äì the function previously held by TV4 AB (which subsequently dropped the \\"TV4-gruppen\\" trade name). Bonnier had acquired those broadcasting companies through a series of acquisition in 2000s. On 20 July 2018, Telia Company announced the acquisition proposal of Bonnier Broadcasting. The deal was completed on 2 December 2019, following an approval from the European Commission. ==Background== In 2005, it was announced that Bonnier Group and Proventus would acquire MTV Oy from Alma Media. In November 2006, it was announced that Bonnier and Proventus would buy the share in the TV4-Gruppen that was then held by Schibsted. The deal was approved in December 2006, making TV4 almost entirely owned by Nordic Broadcasting Oy, a company owned jointly by Bonnier and Proventus. Proventus sold its shares in Nordic Broadcasting to Bonnier in March 2007, making it a fully owned subsidiary of Bonnier. On 16 June 2008, TV4-Gruppen announced it had acquired C More Entertainment from ProSiebenSat.1 Media for ‚Ç¨320 million. ==Sale to Telia Company== On 20 July 2018, Telia Company announced the acquisition proposal of the Bonnier Broadcasting Group for 9.2 billion SEK (roughly $1 billion). The acquisition was expected to end in the second half of 2019, following regulatory approval. There were concerns that the merger would diminish media diversity in Sweden: although Telia, previously a state telecommunication monopoly, was privatised in 1992, the Swedish Government still owns the 37.3% of the share, thus the major network would come under the indirect control of the Swedish government, which already provides public service television broadcasting through SVT. Mikael Damberg, Swedish Minister for Enterprise and Innovation at that time, was quoted by the TT News Agency as saying that both the media diversity and strong economic foundation for the deal would be considered, but the government would not sell its stake in Telia Company even after the deal was secured. A Moderate Party spokesperson issued a statement, saying that the government's long-term agenda should be selling its stake in the telecommunications company. On 15 March 2019, Telia Company formally notified the European Commission of the acquisition, triggering phase 1 investigation. On 10 May, the European Commission launched the in-depth, phase 2 investigation over the deal, as there were another concerns regarding network neutrality and eliminating competitions (for example, removing Bonnier Broadcasting's television channels and its programming libraries from rival multichannel TV platforms and streaming services, offering Bonnier Broadcasting's free-to-air channels through bundled deals for Telia's customers, denying customers of rival ISPs and MNOs from accessing to Bonnier Broadcasting's streaming services, removing advertisements of Telia's competitors from Bonnier Broadcasting's advertising inventories), especially in Sweden and Finland, where Telia Company operates IPTV services. Prior to the formal launch of the phase 2 investigation, Reuters reported that Telia Company offered concessions to the Commission in April that year, but these were deemed not sufficient to relieve the concerns. Telia Company appeared to have offered another concessions to the European Commission over the deal on 12 August 2019, but the details were not provided at that time. In early September that year, news reports detailing Telia Company's concessions were surfaced. On 20 October 2019, Telia Company proposed that Marie Ehrling be succeeded by Lars-Johan Jarnheimer, the former CEO of Tele2 until 2008 and then-chair of Egmont Media, as the company's board chair, ahead of the deal's completion. The proposal was approved on 26 November that year, following the extraordinary general meeting. Meanwhile, on 24 October, Telia Company appointed Allison Kirkby, the former CEO of Tele2 from 2015 until 2018 and then went on to become the president and CEO of TDC, as the company's new president and CEO. Kirkby is expected take the role during the second quarter of 2020. On 12 November 2019, the European Commission approved Telia Company's bid to take over Bonnier Broadcasting from Bonnier Group. Per approval, Telia Company agreed that it would offer Bonnier Broadcasting's television channels to rival TV providers in Sweden and Finland on fair, reasonable and non- discriminatory terms (FRAND), license standalone OTT rights to one competing provider in each of Sweden and Finland, open advertising inventories to Telia's competitors in Sweden and Finland on FRAND terms, and provide a package of Liiga (men's top-tier professional ice hockey league in Finland, which Telia Finland has broadcasting rights beginning with the 2018‚Äì19 season) TV channels to rival TV providers in Finland on FRAND terms. In a separate statement, Marie Ehrling, who was still Telia Company's chair of the board at the time, was quoted as saying \\"As a media owner, Telia Company will ensure that continued editorial independence is upheld vis-√†-vis the owners, Board and management\\". The acquisition was completed on 2 December that year, after which the company was renamed TV4 Media AB. ==Assets== ;TV4 AB * TV4 * Sjuan * TV12 * TV4 Film * TV4 Fakta * TV4 Guld ;MTV Oy * MTV3 * Sub * Ava * MTV Sport 1 * MTV Sport 2 * C More Max * C More Juniori ;C More Entertainment * C More First * C More Hits * C More Series * SF-kanalen * C More Sport * C More Fotboll * C More Golf * C More Hockey ==References== ==External links== * \\"Telia and TV4, MTV and C More ‚Äì together we will create magic\\": a minisite by Telia Company on its acquisition of Bonnier Broadcasting * TV4 (Sweden) * MTV Oy corporate information at mtvuutiset.fi Category:Broadcasting companies ","title":"TV4 Media"},{"id":"60291117","text":"FIPI may stand for: * Five Item Personality Inventory: see Big Five personality traits#Measurements * Federation of Image Professionals International: see Personal stylist * Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry * Forest Investigation and Planning Institute of Vietnam ","title":"FIPI"},{"id":"60291124","text":"Rudkin is a surname.

The federation was established in December 1919 by local unions of colliery officials, with the most important being the Northern Colliery Officials' Mutual Association, founded in 1914, and the Lancashire and Cheshire Colliery Officials' Association. It soon had six smaller affiliates, including Consett, the Forest of Dean Colliery Examiners', Overmen, and Shot Firers' Association, the Midland Mining Officials' Association, the Somerset Colliery Officials' Association, and Yorkshire. The federation received recognition from colliery owners in 1920, and quickly negotiated a national agreement on pay and conditions for colliery officials and clerks. By 1936, the membership of the federation was described as \\"surveyors, under-managers, overmen, master wastemen, electricians and engineers, surface foremen, screening plant foremen, and clerks\\". About three-quarters of its members were based in Durham and Northumberland, with the third-largest district being Lancashire, which housed its office, in Bolton. By the 1940s, the federation was known as the National Federation of Colliery Officials and Staffs, reflecting its broader membership, and in 1945 it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), with a membership of 8,183, of whom 120 were women. When the mining industry was nationalised, in 1947, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) sought to unite all workers in the industry. Members of the federation voted heavily in favour of joining the NUM, and did so on 1 January 1947, becoming the Colliery Officials and Staffs Area (COSA). Two smaller, independent unions of colliery officials voted against joining the NUM. The TUC brokered a deal whereby national level clerical staff would transfer to the Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union, and divisional level clerical staff to the Transport and General Workers' Union, and this satisfied the smaller unions so that they dissolved, dividing their members between the new NUM section and the two other unions. As employment in the mining industry declined, COSA became an increasingly important section of the NUM; by 1979, it had 18,980 members out of a total NUM membership of around 250,000. The section survives, and as of 2017, had 24 members. ==General Secretaries== :1919: Thomas Halstead :c.1940: James Shearer :1951: Sidney Ford :1960: Cliff Shephard :1970s: Les Storey :1979: Trevor Bell :1989: Ken Hollingsworth ==References== Category:Trade unions established in 1919 Category:Mining trade unions Category:National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain) Category:1919 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Mining in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom ","title":"National Federation of Colliery Officials"},{"id":"60291451","text":"Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.

Huntington's works include the novel Carfrae's Comedy, the play Barton's Folly, and the bestselling book Madame Solario. Memorial stone of Gladys Huntington, Amberley, West Sussex, England ==Biography== Huntington was born Gladys Theodora Parrish in Philadelphia to a Quaker family on December 13, 1887. Her parents were Alfred Parrish and Katharine Broadwood Jennings. From a young age, she lived in New York, Paris, London, Biarritz, Rome, and \\"a villa on Lake Como.\\" She married Boston native Constant Huntington on October 17, 1916. The two moved to London where Constant opened Putnam's London office. The two resided in Hyde Park Gardens and then at Amberley House in Sussex, where they remained until her death. In 1959, three years after the publication of Madame Solario, Huntington committed suicide. ==Writing== Huntington published two novels, a play, and two short stories in The New Yorker. She is best known for Madame Solario. The novel was anonymously published in 1956 (likely due to what was considered scandalous content), and her identity as the author would not be revealed for three decades. The story takes place in Cadenabbia on Lake Como in 1906. The novel has been translated into seven languages. However, it went out of print for a period of time. Persephone Books released a new edition in 2016 with a foreword by Alison Adburgham. It was adapted into a French film by Ren√© F√©ret in 2012. In a segment on neglected books, Mary Renault in The American Scholar praised the book and called it \\"one of the finest novels of our century.\\" In a letter, Paul Bowles called it \\"beautifully imagined and written\\", adding, \\"What a shame that the author never wrote anything else! And didn‚Äôt even dare sign her name to it for fear of scandalizing her British in-laws. (She was American, of course!)\\" When Penguin published the novel in paperback in 1978, The New York Times wrote, \\"When first published 1956, this anonymous novel was acclaimed for its elegant style and disturbing urgency.

Coronation Park was built to honour the coronation of King George VI in 1937. Trees are planted to honour the Canadian men and women who participated in World War I and earlier wars. Built during the Great Depression, the construction used many workers on relief. It is constructed on landfill on the shore of Lake Ontario. The park also has the Victory-Peace World War II monument located at water's edge. To the east is HMCS York, the naval barracks. To the north is Fort York and the Fort York Armoury. To the west is Exhibition Place, once the site of New Fort York. ==Construction== In 1934, Toronto was suffering through the Great Depression, with 23% of the population on relief. The Toronto Harbour Commission regularly dredged the bottom of Toronto Harbour to keep it at navigation depth. In exchange for the City of Toronto government paying for navigation improvements, the Commission deposited of sand along the lakeshore at the foot of Strachan Avenue to east, between the existing seawall and shoreline. The City would take possession of the new land for park purposes. The ($ in dollars) project was approved by the City of Toronto Board of Control in December 1934. Construction began in the spring of 1935. One of the objectives of the project was to provide work to unemployed workers on welfare. Seventy-five per cent of the workers were registered with the Department of Public Welfare. The park's construction was hard labour. While steam shovels did the dredging, the soil was moved wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow. One worker collapsed and three horses died. The park was completed in time for the planting of trees on May 12, 1937, Coronation Day, a public holiday in Toronto. One year later on August 1, as part of a large reunion of veterans, each tree had a granite stone and plaque installed next to it. Each plaque described the regiment the tree represented. The plaque for the Royal Oak, planted by Justice John A. Hope, was unveiled by Sir William Mulock (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario). Veterans also donated park benches to the park in 1938. Another tree planting occurred with the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. A tree was planted for every public and separate school in Toronto. 123 maples were planted along Remembrance Drive, each tree planted while the Royal car passed by. Another 20 trees were planted on the occasion of the 2010 G20 Toronto summit. ==Design== Many of the trees still have the memorial markers The park has trees planted for each regiment of the Canadian Expeditionary Forces in World War I, and one for the King (called the \\"King's Oak\\"). The idea for a commemorative planting of trees was developed by F. E. Robson of Men of the Trees and Thomas Hobbs and Andrew Gillespie of the Toronto Ex-Serviceman's Coronation Committee. The idea was approved by Toronto Board of Control and the Coronation Park Advisory Committee supervised details of the plantings. Hobbs died in service in 1940 and a small cairn in his memory was placed in the park. The design consisted of grouping trees around a central Royal Oak, symbolizing the King. An inner ring of oak trees, known as the \\"Empire Circle\\", represents the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and the Crown Colonies. To the north, the Imperial Service triangle of trees represented the Royal Navy, Air Force and Army. On either side of the ring are separate groves of maple trees representing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Canadian divisions, Siberian troops, and Corp Troops to the east and west. The Corps Troops trees included trees commemorating Canadian nursing sisters and veterans of the Second Boer War, the 1885 rebellion, and the Fenian Raids of 1866. A total of 144 trees were donated by the Toronto Chapter of Men of the Trees. ==Victory-Peace Monument== Part of the Victory-Peace Monument At water's edge, a permanent war memorial was built in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. It is situated in a small clearing south of the trees. Known as the \\"Victory-Peace Monument\\" it was erected by the World War II 50th Anniversary Memorial Tribute Committee. The memorial is in a circle of concrete on the ground. In the center of the circle is a brass disk in diameter with the words \\"1939 1945 PEACE\\" inscribed and the word peace etched into the disk in other languages. The circle is bounded by a rim of concrete steps. Six of the steps have black granite blocks about by . Each block is etched with words or artwork relevant to the war. There are two sets of bronze walls, arranged like ship prows. Between the walls are maple leaves. One is engraved \\"Sacrifice\\". The walls surrounding it has artwork depicting information about Canada's involvement in World War II. The monument was designed by artist John McEwan. It was dedicated by Canadian Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc on November 14, 1995. Just to the east is a tall flagpole with a \\"victory garden\\" planted around it. ==Park== View of Toronto Coronation Park Pavilion from West The park has three ball diamonds which are used during non-winter months for informal softball and baseball leagues. During the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), the diamonds are used for the CNE Lions Club Pee-Wee Tournament for youth players. During the winter, an outdoor ice rick is built at the park. It is also used informally for ice hockey. The park also has a dog off-leash area and a clubhouse. Between two of the diamonds is Coronation Park Pavilion, built in 1995, which has washrooms, lockers and showers for the users of the diamonds. Remembrance Drive extends through the park, along the northern boundary of the tree groves. The Martin Goodman Trail extends through the park, along the water's edge. ==History== The memorial park was twice threatened to be removed. During the planning stages of the Gardiner Expressway, it was proposed to move Old Fort York to Coronation Park. This was opposed by a coalition of veteran's groups and historical societies. A second occurred in 1971 when it was proposed to expand Exhibition Place, turning the park into a new location for the midway amusements and rides. Veterans' and labour organizations successfully stopped the proposal. The memorial was rededicated on November 10, 2018 on the 100th-year anniversary of the end of World War I. It was rededicated by Ontario Lieutenant-Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Toronto Mayor John Tory and members of the Canadian Armed Forces. The memorial is being restored during 2018 and 2019 using funds from a Government of Canada program to refurbish cenotaphs and memorials country-wide, the City of Toronto and private sources. The first phase restored the area of the Royal Oak and the Empire Circle. Phase two during 2019 will restore the maple grove.

Harris is an American actor and playwright, known for his plays ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù and Slave Play. He was the winner of the 2018 Paula Vogel Playwriting Award, given by the Vineyard Theatre in New York City. A profile in the New York Times said that Harris's \\"ability to render subconscious trauma into provocative theatrical expression, as potentially unsettling as entertaining, has earned him a lot of attention in a very short time.\\" Out called him \\"The queer black savior the theater world needs.\\" ==Early life== Harris grew up in a military family, moving often before settling in Martinsville, Virginia. He has since lived in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. He attended the Carlisle School in Martinsville, Virginia. Harris studied toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts in acting from The Theatre School at DePaul University in 2009 but was cut from the program after a year. He graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from the Yale School of Drama in 2019. == Career == He took a role in the play Jon at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company. He worked as an actor in Chicago, then moved to Los Angeles to further his career. There he began a collaboration with musician Isabella Summers that resulted in the play Xander Xyst, Dragon 1; the play was produced at ANT Fest 2017 in New York. He had a residency at the MacDowell Colony, where he wrote the play ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù, in which a young black artist (Franklin) becomes involved with an older European art collector (Andre). ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù served as Harris's writing sample when he applied to the Yale School of Drama, where he began studies in the fall of 2016. While still at Yale, Harris wrote Slave Play. It was produced at Yale in October 2017, and won the Lorraine Hansberry Playwriting Award and the Rosa Parks Playwriting Award at the 2018 American College Theater Festival. It was then produced off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop under the direction of Robert O'Hara in 2018, Harris's first professional production as playwright. The play addresses sexuality and racial trauma in America. It begins with interracial sexual violence on a slave plantation in the American South and continues in present-day America at a sex therapy retreat for interracial couples. The couples include black participants who are no longer able to receive pleasure from their white partners. The white partners have a blind- spot about the role that race plays in their relationships. Critic Jesse Green summarized the play's message, saying \\"that one race lives with history each day while another pretends not to.\\" Though critically acclaimed, the play drew ire from those who found the play's content disrespectful of African- American's history. In 2018, Harris was awarded the Paula Vogel Playwriting Award, which includes a residency at the off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre. In 2019, The New Group and the Vineyard Theatre co-produced a revised version of Harris's earlier play, ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù, starring Alan Cumming. Reviewer Christian Lewis called the play \\"a bold, experimental, political, and important work of theater that will not soon be forgotten.\\" New York Times reviewer Ben Brantley noted some excellent performances, but found the dialogue \\"endless and circular and repetitive\\" and the play too \\"cerebral.\\" In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, sparking the start of the modern LGBT rights movement, Queerty named him one of the Pride50 ‚Äútrailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people.‚Äù In November 2019, an experimental work entitled Black Exhibition, credited under the pseudonym @GaryXXXFisher, debuted at the Brooklyn theater Bushwick Starr. Using Ntozake Shange's term choreopoem to describe its structure, Harris combines language and movement in a work that centers on five characters: San Francisco writer Gary Fisher, Kathy Acker, Yukio Mishima, Samuel R. Delany, and Missouri college athlete Michael L. Johnson. Harris is a co-author on the screenplay for the forthcoming film Zola, directed by Janicza Bravo. The film follows a road trip that results in sex-trafficking, and is based on a real-life Twitter thread. He also still acts. In early 2020, Harris signed a deal with HBO, and is developing a pilot as well as becoming a co-producer for season 2 of Euphoria, after consulting on the first season. == Personal life == Harris is Black and gay.

It is in three movements: #Anrufung Apolls (Invocation of Apollo) #Dithyrambe (Dithyramb) #Beschw√∂rungstanz (Incantation Dance) A typical performance lasts approximately 25 minutes. The first movement is broadly divided into three sections. The first is quiet, featuring the flutes, bass clarinet, bassoons and horns, developing into fanfares from the brass. This leads into the second section, a quick and accelerating Passacaglia. After a climax, the quiet mood of the beginning returns. The second movement features the horn themes from the first which frame an Andantino section featuring the harp, which in turn frames a broad hymn-like central section. The final movement has been described as \\"wild, almost orgiastic [and] dance based\\".Thomas Schulz (2011), liner notes for Wergo recording Rhythms of 3/4 and 3/8 prevail and the mood is only interrupted briefly by a calm and canonic episode immediately before the \\"furious\\" ending. Henze himself said that the symphony is an attempt to \\"separate the term \\"symphony\\" from the idea of Classical or Romantic forms.\\" and has a \\"thoroughly Pagan atmosphere\\". ==Reception== The first performance at Donaueschingen was met with dismay by some of Henze's colleagues. According to Henze \\"Some people were not best pleased that the work failed to follow the modernist eclectics of the Darmstadt School.\\" ==Ballet== In 1951 choreographer Peter van Dijk choreographed the Anrufung Apolls movement for an evening of ballet conducted by Henze on 28 October 1951 as part of the German-French Culture Days festival in Wiesbaden. ==Recordings== * American Symphony Orchestra records - American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Botstein * Deutsche Grammophon/Brilliant Classics - Berlin Philharmonic conducted by the composer * Wergo - Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Marek Janowski ==References== 3 Category:1950 compositions ","title":"Symphony No. 3 (Henze)"},{"id":"60292479","text":"The Rivergate Parkway, also historically known as the Two Mile Parkway, is a major east‚Äìwest, four-lane thoroughfare in northern Davidson County in Middle Tennessee.

The film stars Devin France, Yashua Mack, Gage Naquin, Gavin Naquin, Ahmad Cage, Krzysztof Meyn, and Romyri Ross. It is intended to be a re-imagining of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Wendy had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2020 and was released on February 28, 2020 by Searchlight Pictures. == Plot == Angela Darling works as a waitress at Darling's Diner near a railroad in the rural South, with her young children ‚Äì twins James and Douglas, and youngest daughter Wendy ‚Äì hanging around there. Youngster Thomas Marshall, having his birthday one day, is jokingly told by his grandmother that he and Angela's children that they'll be working at the diner when they grow up. Insisting that he'll be a pirate, Thomas goes outside at the thought of having to get older and work. A train passes by, and a small figure runs on the roof and gets Thomas to climb onto the train as Wendy watches. Years later, Wendy is nine years old and has a thirst for adventure, coming up with her own bedtime stories to read to herself, despite assisting her mother with the diner along with her brothers. One night, Angela tells them about her life, indicating that she gave up on her dreams to raise a family, making Wendy wonder whether she will have to give up her own dreams as a grown-up. After school, Wendy contemplates boarding the train, but fails to do so when she chases it. That night, Wendy notices a boy at her window, who jumps onto the train and inspires her to follow. Waking her brothers, the kids climb out of their window and hop onto the train. They are met by the boy, rambunctious Peter, who tells them they are going on an adventure. Travelling through the night, the kids ride the train far away from home until Peter pushes them out into a river. There they encounter another kid, Cudjoe Head, in a rowboat, which takes them all to a volcanic tropical island where they find other children, including Thomas, who is still as young as he was when he ran away. The Darlings discover that children have a connection with the island's spirit from the volcano, called Mother by Peter, who tells Wendy that as long as they believe in Mother she will provide for them. Mother's influence prevents the children from aging, so long as they believe in her, explaining how Thomas remained a child. Peter takes Wendy and her brothers across the island, playing with the other boys and having many adventures; as well as discovering Mother's physical form as a large glowing fish and that singing to her revitalises her. Despite the island's paradise, Wendy starts to worry for her mother and the fact that she will notice her children are gone. While the kids are sleeping, an elderly man wanders close by. When Wendy greets him, he runs off into a barren side of the island, where the other children shun him. They explain his name is Buzzo, a former member of their group who lost faith in Mother when he lost his best friend, and so aged into an old man. Whilst exploring, the children find a capsized boat called the Ma√±ana, which the Darlings swim into. Douglas hits and cuts his head, disappearing from sight. Wendy and James get Peter and the other children to help look for him, but after searching the island they find it a lost cause. Without his twin brother, James becomes more withdrawn and dour. Wendy discovers that James' right hand has become aged, and although he and Wendy try to hide it, Peter soon notices it. Fearing it'll mean he will age rapidly like Buzzo, he asks Peter to cut it off, who does so with his knife. Shocked and disgusted, Wendy takes James to the outskirts, where she finds Buzzo. He takes them to the other side of the island, where a group of \\"Olds\\", children who lost faith in Mother, live a sullen and depressed life. Wendy's attempts to cheer them up fail when James, bitter at having to grow up without Douglas, rallies the group to find, kill and eat Mother in order to regain their youth, using the children as bait. Wendy runs back to warn them, but is too late when the Olds show up and kidnap the children, and repurpose the Ma√±ana as a fishing boat. Evading the Olds, Wendy and Peter witness an older James fashioning a hook for his missing hand. Whilst hiding from the Ma√±ana, the pair discover that Douglas is alive. They swim to the Ma√±ana, where they find the now elderly James, who shows resentment towards Douglas for not aging as he did. The ship approaches the Mother fish, which James throws a harpoon at and severely wounds it. After Peter and Wendy rescue them, the children go underwater to help Mother, but she dies and James finds a piece of Mother losing its glow. With Peter and the children mournful and the Olds disheartened, Wendy gets them to all start singing. As their singing grows louder, Peter becomes more inspired, and the volcano erupts once more. Wendy and Douglas decide it is time for them to go home. Knowing that he cannot go home, James stays to play with Peter as his new ‚Äúenemy‚Äù Captain Hook, thereby allowing him to live out the rest of his days with the spirit of a child. In Wendy‚Äôs closing narration, she, Douglas and the other children have returned home to their own families. They have many adventures together as they grow older, eventually growing apart. Many years later, Wendy is now a mother with her own daughter, telling the story of Peter and the island. At night, while Wendy sleeps, her daughter hops on the train with Peter. Wendy sees and runs after them, but she cannot catch up to them. Wendy then decides not to pursue, as she feels her daughter is in good hands and is ready for an adventure of her own. ==Cast== * Devin France as Wendy Darling ** Tommie Milazzo as Baby Wendy ** Allison Campbell as Adult Wendy * Yashua Mack as Peter Pan * Gage Naquin as Douglas Darling * Gavin Naquin as James Darling * Kevin Pugh as Captain James Hook * Ahmad Cage as Sweet Heavy * Krzysztof Meyn as Thomas * Romyri Ross as Cudjoe Head * Lowell Landes as Buzzo * Shay Walker as Angela Darling ==Production== In August 2015, it was announced Benh Zeitlin would write and direct the film.

It is based on Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code laws in India. The film stars Akshaye Khanna, Richa Chadha, Meera Chopra and Rahul Bhat. Principal photography of the film began in January 2019. The film was theatrically released in India on 13 September 2019, and received mixed reviews, holding a 64% Critics Rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film opened to low numbers on opening day and was declared \\"Average\\" at box office. == Plot == Notable film director Rohan Khurana (Rahul Bhat) is arrested and convicted by a sessions court after assistant costume designer Anjali Dangle (Meera Chopra) accuses him of rape. In the High Court, senior and talented criminal barrister Tarun Saluja (Akshaye Khanna) works hard to punch holes in the accuser‚Äôs claims, while Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chadda), a utopian and fervent lawyer fighting her first big case, who was once Saluja's trainee, serve as the prosecutor and defence barrister of the claimed victim. Insisting that it is a case of an affair gone sour, Tarun Saluja points out that the law does not regard consensual physical relations as rape. Hiral Gandhi refuses to call it anything but rape, demanding justice to be served. Tarun Saluja states that Law is a fact, Justice is abstract. The case disputes the legal provisions of the penal code 375 that defines conditions under which a sexual offense can be defined as rape. There was a scene in which Tarun Saluja explain Hiral Gandhi that how justice is left out while Defence, Prosecution and even Judge try to show themselves as best. As we can see before giving final verdict one of judge goes to balcony and see people protesting against accused and later on the charges are upheld against accused. This showed that judge didn't want to tarnish their image by giving correct decision in favour of accused. The end line was perfect by Tarun Saluja \\" We're in the business of law, not of Justice\\". == Cast == * Akshaye Khanna as Tarun Saluja, defence barrister of the accused * Richa Chadda as lawyer and public prosecutor Hiral Gandhi *Meera Chopra as victim Anjali Dangle * Rahul Bhat as Director Rohan Khurana * Shriswara as Kainaz, Rohan's wife * Sandhya Mridul as Shilpa, Tarun's wife * Kishor Kadam as Justice Madgaonkar * Kruttika Desai as Justice Indrani * Annuup Choudhari as Pramod Dangle, Anjali's brother * Tanuka Laghate as Meera Singh * Kshama Ninave as mrs.

Sreeparna Sengupta of The Times of India gave the film four stars out of five, praising screenplay, dialogues and performance of Akshaye Khanna, Richa Chadha, Rahul Bhat and Kishor Kadam, noted that the film made for a 'gripping watch with a crisp runtime and top-notch performances'. Concluding she wrote, \\"Overall, Section 375 is an audacious effort. It is a relevant film that tackles a complex issue and one that will engage, inform and open up debates.\\" Trade analyst and critic Taran Adarsh gave the film four stars out of five, tagged it as \\"Powerful\\" and praised the performance of Akshaye Khanna, Richa Chadha, writing and direction. He opined, \\"A relevant film that raises pertinent points... Recommended!\\" Udita Jhunjhunwala of Firstpost gave three and half stars out of five and opined that it was the cinematography and editing that kept the film moving at desirable pace and in mood. Praising Manish Gupta‚Äôs writing, she concluded that the film neither took a shrill, moralistic stand, nor caved to 'Bollywood-ised courtroom hysteria', rather it stuck to a highly charged narrative that deftly examined both sides of the case and deferred to the rule of law. Devesh Sharma reviewing for Filmfare rates the film with three stars out of five. He wrote that the film was a 'well-crafted', 'well- acted' film with pithy and witty dialogues. He praised performance of Khanna and Chadha, but criticising the climax, concluded, ‚ÄúThis criminal twist at the very end undoes all the good done by the film and leaves you with a bitter taste in the mouth. The director is trying to be too clever here but this cleverness eats away into the nobility of the film.\\" Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News gave three and half stars out of five, concurring in praising lead cast she wrote, \\"Both Khanna and Chadha are in top form as warring legal counsels\\". She also praised the editing of the film and noted that film was off-beat, but concurring with Sharma she felt that the second half was made 'frustratingly convenient'. Concluding she opined, \\"While you may not be thrilled at where the film is headed, the right thing to do is to give the searing Section 375 a fair trial.\\" Writing for CNN-News18, Rajeev Masand termed the film as an 'unmistakably compelling courtroom drama' and rated it with three and half stars out of five.

The capsize was caused by overcrowding on-board the vessel, and by high water levels on the Tigris. Many of the passengers were celebrating the Kurdish New Year. == Sinking == The sinking occurred on 21 March 2019 when a ferry carrying passengers sank in the Tigris river near Mosul. The vessel was carrying passengers to Umm al-Rabeein, an island upriver from the city, and was crowded with people celebrating Newroz. The ferry‚Äîwhich had a capacity of 50 passengers‚Äîwas loaded with nearly 200 people. On the voyage upriver, the ship began to founder, eventually capsizing and sinking. Over a hundred passengers drowned, while 55 were rescued by emergency services and the Iraqi military. As of 22 March, over 50 passengers remain missing. Following the disaster, Mosulans began to protest against the owners of the ferry and against the local government, with much of the blame for the disaster being directed at Governor Nawfal al-Akoub. The sinking also prompted the Iraqi government to investigate allegations of corruption within the city's government. During a funeral ceremony near the site of the sinking, an angry crowd of protesters confronted Governor al-Akoub, with some protesters eventually throwing insults and bricks at the governor. The governor's vehicle later ran over several people during his escape from the crowd, further inflaming tensions and leading to more calls to replace al-Akoub. A week later Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi requested that the Iraqi parliament remove al-Akoub as governor, which the body did on 24 March. == References == Category:2019 in Iraq Category:March 2019 events in Iraq Category:Maritime incidents in 2019 Category:Maritime incidents in Iraq ","title":"2019 Mosul ferry sinking"},{"id":"60292936","text":"Bug Riders is a video game developed by n-Space and published by GT Interactive for the PlayStation in 1997, followed by a port to Windows in 1998 and a re-release on PlayStation Network in 2011. ==Gameplay== Bug Riders is a game which involves a bug-riding race to determine who will replace the dying emperor of the planet Entymion. To accelerate, the player strikes their bug with a crop. Careful rhythm is demanded, as using the crop too frequently will cause the bug to cry out in pain and slow down. ==Reception== Bug Riders received generally negative reviews, primarily because of the system for controlling the bugs. In particular, critics overwhelmingly detested the cropping system used to accelerate, finding it overly difficult to master. Shawn Smith argued in Electronic Gaming Monthly, \\"Let's just stick with a standard 'press the button and hold it' acceleration that practically EVERY other racing game has. It's what we're used to as gamers. When something like this comes along, we don't know what to do.\\" Most critics also found that the bugs having minds of their own, allowing them to fly without input from the player and sometimes resist the player's inputs, proved to be frustrating. The level designs had a more mixed response, with some praising their for their visual design and variety, while others found they did not make it obvious where the player needed to go. While there was also scattered praise for elements such as the music, critics felt the control issues overrode all the game's positive elements. GamePro, for example, opined that \\"While there are some cool weapons to pick up as well as a good variety of bug steeds, because of bad control, praising these aspects is like toweling off the Titanic.\\" Next Generation commented, \\"The premise has some promise, offering all sorts of new gameplay ideas like riding living creatures and flying through the air. However, these same ideas, at least the execution of them, are what bring the game down.\\" ==Reviews== *Official PlayStation Magazine #3 (1997 December) *Game.EXE - Jan, 1998 *PC Games - Mar, 1998 ==References== Category:1997 video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ","title":"Bug Riders"},{"id":"60292940","text":"Wanda Hamidah (born 21 September 1977) is an Indonesian politician, actress and activist.

Following the success of \\"Old Town Road\\", Nas X released his debut EP, titled 7, which spawned two further singles‚Å†, with \\"Panini\\" peaking at number 5 on the Hot 100 and \\"Rodeo\\" peaking at number 22. Nas X was the most-nominated male artist at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, where he ultimately won awards for Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. \\"Old Town Road\\" earned him two MTV Video Music Awards including Song of the Year; the American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip Hop Song; and Nas X is the first and only openly LGBTQ artist to win a Country Music Association award. Time named him as one of the 25 most influential people on the Internet in 2019. In addition, he was featured on Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2020. ==Early life and education== Montero Lamar Hill was born in Lithia Springs, Georgia, a small city outside of Atlanta, on April 9, 1999.Chow, Andrew R. (April 5, 2019). \\"Lil Nas X Talks 'Old Town Road' and the Billboard Controversy.\\" Time. Retrieved April 6, 2019. His parents divorced when he was six, and he settled in the Bankhead Courts housing project with his mother and grandmother. Three years later, he moved in with his father, a gospel singer, north of the city in Austell, Georgia. Although initially reluctant to leave, he later regarded it as an important decision: \\"There's so much shit going on in Atlanta‚Äîif I would have stayed there, I would have fallen in with the wrong crowd.\\" He started \\"using the Internet heavily right around the time when memes started to become their own form of entertainment\\"; about when he was thirteen. He spent much of his teenage years alone, and turned to the Internet, \\"particularly Twitter, creating memes that showed his disarming wit and pop-culture savvy.\\" His teenage years also saw him struggling with his coming out to himself as being gay; he prayed that it was just a phase, but around sixteen or seventeen he came to accept it. He began playing trumpet in the fourth grade and was first chair by his junior high years, but quit out of fear of looking uncool. He attended Lithia Springs High School and graduated in 2017. He attended the University of West Georgia for one year before dropping out to pursue a musical career. During this time, he stayed with his sister and supported himself with jobs at Zaxby's restaurants and the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park. In September 2019 he revisited his high school to perform a surprise concert. == Career == ===2015‚Äì2017: Internet personality=== Hill said he began to isolate himself from \\"outside-of-class activities\\" during his teenage years. He spent large amounts of time online in hopes of building a following as an internet personality to promote his work, but was unsure what to focus on creatively. In a Rolling Stone interview he stated, \\"I was doing Facebook comedy videos, then I moved over to Instagram, and then I hopped on Twitter ... where I really was a master. That was the first place where I could go viral.\\" Nas X has: 2.3 million followers on Twitter; four million followers on Instagram; \\"5.2 million subscribers on YouTube, and over 44 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\\" He posted short-format comedy videos on Facebook and Vine. During this period, he reportedly created and ran Nicki Minaj fan accounts on Twitter, including one called \\"@NasMaraj\\", according to a New York Magazine investigation. In 2017, this account gained attention for its flash fiction-style interactive \\"scenario threads\\" popularized on Twitter using dashboard app TweetDeck. The investigation linked @NasMaraj to the practice of \\"Tweetdecking\\", or using multiple accounts in collaboration to artificially make certain tweets go viral. The @NasMaraj account was suspended by Twitter due to \\"violating spam policies\\". After the suspension of @NasMaraj, New York Magazine's investigation concluded that he subsequently opened a new account with handle \\"@NasMarai\\", and that his current Twitter account at the time was a repurposed version of that \\"@NasMarai\\" account with a changed handle. After media reports linked Nas X to the Minaj fan accounts, he called the reports a \\"misunderstanding\\", effectively denying having run the accounts. However, in May 2020, Lil Nas X admitted, in a tweet, to being a fan of Minaj. He explained why he initially denied it, stating that if people knew he was a fan of hers, they would think he was gay: \\"People will assume if you had an entire fan page dedicated to nicki u are gay. and the rap/music industry ain't exactly built or accepting of gay men yet\\". On June 17, 2020, Minaj responded to Nas, tweeting \\"It was a bit of a sting when you denied being a barb, but I understand. Congratulations on building up your confidence to speak your truth\\". Lil Nas apologized to Minaj, saying he \\"felt so bad, hoping u wouldn't see my denial\\". In late 2019, Lil Nas X landed on music as a path to success, and started writing and recording songs in his closet. He adopted the name Lil Nas X, which is a tribute to the rapper Nas. In late October 2018, he ran across the music that would be \\"Old Town Road\\". === 2018‚Äì2019: \\"Old Town Road\\"s success and 7 EP === On December 3, 2018, Nas X released the country rap song \\"Old Town Road\\". He bought the beat for the song anonymously on an online store from Dutch producer YoungKio for $30; it samples Nine Inch Nails' track \\"34 Ghosts IV\\" from their sixth studio album Ghosts I‚ÄìIV (2008). He recorded at a \\"humble\\" Atlanta studio, CinCoYo, on their \\"$20 Tuesdays\\" taking less than an hour. Nas X began creating memes to promote \\"Old Town Road\\" before it was picked up by short-form video social media TikTok users. TikTok encourages its 500 million global users to \\"endless imitation,\\" with videos generating copies usually using the same music; the \\"app‚Äôs frantic churn of content ...acts as a potent incubator for viral music hits.\\" Nas X estimated he made about a hundred memes to promote it; the song went viral in early 2019 due to the #Yeehaw Challenge meme on TikTok. Millions of users posted videos of themselves dressed as a wrangler or cowgirl, with most #yeehaw videos using the song for their soundtrack; as of July 2019, they have been seen more than 67 million times. Another core audience tied to social media is children who are hidden in the statistics of adult listeners. Quartz.com says the song certainly owes part of its success to the demographic, and notes they are attracted to the song being repetitive, easy to sing along to, and using lyrics about riding horses and tractors, which kids can relate to. It debuted at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, later climbing to number one. The track also debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart at number 19 and Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs at number 36. After an \\"intense bidding war\\", Nas X signed with Columbia Records in March 2019. Billboard controversially removed the song from the Hot Country songs chart in March 2019 telling Rolling Stone: In Robert Christgau's opinion, \\"Taking 'Old Town Road' off the country chart strikes me as racist pure and simple, because country radio remains racist regardless of the Darius Ruckers and Kane Browns it makes room for.\\" Another Billboard spokesperson told Genius, \\"Billboards decision to take the song off of the country chart had absolutely nothing to do with the race of the artist.\\" Despite being removed from the main Country Songs chart, the song charted on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, debuting at 53, and peaking at 50. In response, Sony Music Nashville CEO Randy Goodman told Billboard that his team started testing the song in some country radio markets, adding \\"it would be negligent not to look at it\\". In May 2019, the issues of racism in country music culture came up again when Wrangler announced its Lil Nas X collection, and some consumers threatened a boycott. Media outlets also noted that the song brings attention to the historic cultural erasure of African- Americans from both country music and the American frontier era. Country music star Billy Ray Cyrus supported \\"Old Town Road\\", and became the featured vocalist in an April 2019 remix, the first of several. That same month, Nas X broke Drake's record for the most U.S. streams in one week with 143 million streams for the week ending April 11, surpassing Drake's \\"In My Feelings\\", which had 116.2 million streams in a week in July 2018; as of August 2019 it has streamed over a billion plays on Spotify alone. NBC News's Michael Arceneaux noted, In May 2019, the video was released and as of August 2019, has over 370 million views. Nas X released his debut EP, 7, on June 21, 2019. The EP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. On June 23, 2019, Nas X performed with Cyrus at the 2019 BET Awards. On June 30, Nas X made his international debut at the largest greenfield festival in the world, the U.K.‚Äôs annual Glastonbury Festival, when he and Billy Ray Cyrus made a surprise appearance and joined Miley Cyrus for the song, before performing his new single \\"Panini\\" solo in a set seen nationally on BBC. On the same day, Nas X became one of the most visible Black queer male singers when he came out as gay. This was especially significant for an artist in the country and hip hop genres, both of which emphasize machismo and \\"historically snubbed queer artists\\". Black queer male artists in hip hop having mainstream acceptance arguably started in 2012 with Frank Ocean‚Äôs coming out just before Channel Orange was released. For end of June 2019 sales, Rolling Stone premiered the Rolling Stone Top 100 in early July with three Nas X songs: \\"Rodeo\\" with Cardi B at number nine; \\"Panini\\" at four; and \\"Old Town Road\\" as the first-ever number-one song on the chart. ===2020: Debut album=== On July 7, 2020, Lil Nas X revealed that his upcoming debut album is \\"almost finished\\". He also stated that he is working on a mixtape, and invited producers to submit their beats for his new music. On July 10, he teased the release of a new song titled \\"Call Me by Your Name\\", posting a snippet of it online. On July 29, Barbadian singer Rihanna praised the snippet during a video call with Nas X. In September 2020, Lil Nas X revealed the titles of some of the songs from the upcoming album, including \\"Call Me By Your Name\\", \\"One of Me\\", \\"Titanic\\", and \\"Don't Want It\\". ==Public recognition== In July 2019, Time named him one of the 25 most influential people on the Internet for his \\"global impact on social media\\", and \\"overall ability to drive news\\". In late July 2019, the MTV Video Music Award (VMA) nominations were announced, with Nas X receiving eight. He performed \\"Panini,\\" an \\"ode to the cartoon rabbit of the same name from Cartoon Network's Chowder,\\" with a troupe of \\"Tron-inflected dancers\\" at the 2019 MTV VMAs, where he also won two awards: Song of the Year, for which he is the first LGBTQ person to do so; and the video's Calmatic for Best Direction. He was nominated for five fan-chosen 2019 Teen Choice Awards, winning Choice R&B;/Hip-Hop Song for the Cyrus remix of \\"Old Town Road\\". \\"Old Town Road\\" is also the YouTube top song of the summer in the U.S. and over fifty other countries and territories; it is also their second top global song of the summer. Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus‚Äô remix also won the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards collaboration category, CMA Music Event of the Year; Nas X is the first out gay man to ever be nominated for a CMA award, and the only openly LGBTQ person to win. Vox noted the Event Award is not a part of the CMA televised celebration, and they snubbed Nas X from bigger appropriate categories. The \\"Old Town Road\\" remix with Cyrus has been nominated for a People's Choice Award for Song of 2019, Nas X was also nominated for \\"Male Artist of 2019\\" at the 45th People's Choice Awards. In October, at the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards Nas X, with Cyrus, won for Best Collab/Duo or Group, and Single of the Year. Also in October 2019, Nas X's label Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, won the Music & Sound Recordings Award from SAG-AFTRA for \\"Old Town Road (Remix)\\" featuring Cyrus; the awards are presented \\"for work that exemplifies equal access\\" of LGBTQ and \\"other misrepresented or underrepresented groups.\\" In November 2019, Nas X won the American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip Hop Song, he was nominated for four others including three for \\"Old Town Road\\" featuring Billy Ray Cyrus. In November 2019, Nas X was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Best New Artist, and eventually won Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Lil Nas X's success caused him to become the first person of color and the first openly gay performer to be listed by Forbes in its annual Highest-Paid Country Acts List. Ken Burns, who produced the PBS documentary Country Music, noted, \\"Panini\\" was released as Nas X's second single through Columbia Records in June 2019. It is named after the fictional cabbit of the same name in the animated television series Chowder, and does not refer to the sandwich of the same name. In mid-September 2019 \\"Panini\\" had its first remix released with rapper DaBaby. In early July 2019, \\"Old Town Road\\" achieved its 13th week at the top spot on the Billboard 100, becoming the first hip hop song to do so. It is also the first song to sell ten million copies while in the top spot. On its fifteenth week at the top, Nas X became the first openly gay artist to have a song last as long, beating out Elton John‚Äôs 1997 double A-side‚Äîwhere both sides of the record are promoted as hits, \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\"/\\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\\". At nineteen weeks at number one, Nas X holds the record for the most weeks since the chart was first introduced in 1958. , the song has also charted nineteen weeks atop the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart; beating a three-way tie record. At nineteen weeks at the top of the Hot Rap Songs chart the song has also beaten a three-way tie. By November 2019, the song was Diamond Certified, moving a combined sales and streaming ten million units. ==Public image== Prince for the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards' red carpet Nas X has been noted for his public fashions; in July 2019, Vogue noted Nas X as a \\"master\\" at giving the cowboy aesthetic a glam look in his appearances and on Instagram. His stylist, Hodo Musa, says he aims for items that are \\"electric, playful, colorful, and futuristic.\\" For his on-stage look at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards he wore a cowboy motif cherry-red Nudie suit. Wrangler, which is mentioned in the \\"Old Town Road\\" lyrics, has consistently sold out of Nas X co-branded fashions.'Old Town Road' boosts Wrangler jeans For the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards Nas X wore several outfits including a head-to-toe couture fuschia Versace suit with a pink harness which took 700 hours to construct. In July 2020, Lil Nas X modelled in a trailer video for a new skin-care line by Rihanna's Fenty Beauty. ==Personal life== In early June 2019, Nas X came out to his sister and father, and he felt the universe was signalling him to do so despite his uncertainty whether his fans would stick by him or not. On June 30, 2019, the last day of Pride Month, Nas X came out publicly as gay, tweeting: \\"some of y'all already know, some of y'all don't care, some of y'all not gone no more. but before this month ends i want y'all to listen closely to c7osure. üåàü§©‚ú®\\" The tweet confirmed earlier suspicions when he first indicated this in his track \\"c7osure\\". Rolling Stone noted the song \\"touches on themes such as coming clean, growing up and embracing one's self\\". The next day he tweeted again, this time highlighting the rainbow-colored building on the cover art of his EP 7, with the caption reading \\"deadass thought i made it obvious\\". He was unambiguous in an interview several days later on BBC Breakfast, where he stated that he was gay and understands that his sexuality is not readily accepted in the country or rap music communities. The response to the news was mostly positive, but also garnered a large amount of homophobic backlash on social media, to which Nas X also reacted. The backlash also came from the hip hop community, drawing attention to homophobia in hip hop culture. In January 2020, rapper Pastor Troy made some homophobic comments on the outfit Nas X wore during the Grammy Awards, to which Nas X nonchalantly responded: \\"Damn I look good in that pic on god.\\".Lil Nas X Responds To Pastor Troy's Homophobic Rant In A Very Lil Nas X Way vibe.com, 30 January 2020Lil Nas X Shut Down This Rapper's Homophobic Comments in the Best Way pride.com, Taylor Henderson, 29 January 2020Lil Nas X looked too good at the Grammys to worry about Pastor Troy‚Äôs homophobic comments metro.co.uk, Emma Kelly, 31 January 2020Lil Nas X responds to homophobic rant from rapper Pastor TroyLil Nas X Responds to Pastor Troy's Homophobic Post ==Bibliography== Children *C is for Country ==Discography== ===Mixtapes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of mixtapes, with selected details !

The album was released on May 17, 2019 and serves as the band's debut release through Relapse Records. Weeping Choir was produced by Kurt Ballou of Converge, who previously produced Full of Hell's 2017 studio album Trumpeting Ecstasy. == Writing and recording == Since their last album, several of the members of Full of Hell have moved to different cities. Because of this, Weeping Choir became the first Full of Hell album to be written without all members of the band in a practice space. This time, guitarist and primary songwriter Spencer Hazard wrote full songs in his bedroom on his own and the band would get together to practice the new material about once or twice a month because of their new \\"adult\\" responsibilities. Hazard says this new approach to writing material resulted in some of their most complex and challenging songs ever created. He said: \\"This record definitely had parts where I wrote the riff and it sounded really cool, but once we got all together we were like, 'This is in some weird time signature I don't even know how to count it,' kind of thing. Even when we got in the studio, Kurt [Ballou] was like, 'I don‚Äôt know what time signature that is.'\\" Weeping Choir marks the second Full of Hell album to be recorded and produced by Kurt Ballou, guitarist of the hardcore band Converge, who worked with Full of Hell on their prior album, Trumpeting Ecstasy. Full of Hell reported that Ballou pushed the band harder this time than before, but ultimately best captured the sound of their live performances out of all their albums to date. Hazard elaborated: \\"[On] Trumpeting he kind of let us do our own thing. But this time he was definitely like, 'No, do it again. You can do better.' I feel like he was able to get better takes out of us this time.\\" == Composition, sound and theme == For Weeping Choir, the members of Full of Hell drew inspiration from their entire discography. This included drawing elements of hardcore music from Roots of Earth Are Consuming My Home (2011), experimental grindcore elements from Rudiments of Mutilation (2013) and the death metal influences on Trumpeting Ecstasy (2017). The band also attributes their new ability to work in a studio and build a song around an electronic beat (giving \\"Angels Gather Here\\" as one example) to their experimental collaborative albums with The Body. Spencer Hazard says it was a conscious decision to recall different music styles from all their previous albums. Hazard elaborated: \\"With [Weeping Choir], I kinda wanted to reel it back and take aspects from every record we've ever done and try to combine it together. That's why there's longer songs, and more like hardcore parts, but still plenty of death metal riffs and straight-up grind and powerviolence stuff.\\" On Trumpeting Ecstasy, Full of Hell dialed back their noise and electronic influences because that album was book-ended by their collaborations with The Body and Merzbow. Vocalist Dylan Walker says they re-incorporated noise and electronics into Weeping Choir knowing they were absent on their previous album, and because they \\"wanted to make a well-rounded record again\\". The album features several guest collaborations, including performances from members of Insect Warfare, Charles Bronson and Lingua Ignota. Walker says all the guests invited to appear on Weeping Choir are friends and artists they respect, and they were initially worried the album featured too many guests. Kristin Hayter, who performs under the name Lingua Ignota, appears on the album's longest track \\"Armory Of Obsidian Glass\\". Hayter said it \\"was a great pleasure to work on\\" the song, and that she, \\"wanted my vocals to provide a counterpoint to all the savagery, to pick up on and accentuate harmonic things happening in the music in an unexpected way. I think the effect overall is chilling, wild, and I'm excited for people to hear it.\\" Weeping Choir is also considered a companion or \\"sister\\" album to Trumpeting Ecstasy. The two are linked both with inverted album artwork‚ÄîTrumpeting Ecstasy features a faceless figure with white fire rising to the right, Weeping Choir features a faceless figure with a black void of smoke rising to the left‚Äîand thematically related lyrics. While the lyrics were intentionally vague and open to interpretation, inspired by bands such as Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Walker said the two albums are connected to events in his personal life. Walker said of the connection: \\"I guess all I can say is that Trumpeting was like a bubble being popped in my personal life, and kind of like a very moment-in-time record just based on what was going on in the Western world. Weeping Choir is kind of all that's left in the wake of that; it's definitely meant to be a more sombre record.\\" == Marketing and promotion == Full of Hell began promoting Weeping Choir with an online stream and music video directed by Cody Stauder for the opening track \\"Burning Myrrh\\" in March 2019. The following month in April 2019, the band released an online stream and Frank Huang-created video for \\"Silmaril\\"‚Äîa reference to the Silmaril jewels from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. The final album track used to promote Weeping Choir prior to release was an online stream of \\"Armory of Obsidian Glass\\" in May 2019.

It was premiered at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Berlin on 9 October 1963 by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the composer. ==Background== The fourth symphony was originally the finale to act two of Henze's opera K√∂nig Hirsch (King Stag). The opera was due to be given its first performance on 23 September 1956 in Berlin. Rehearsals went badly. The conductor Hermann Scherchen insisted on substantial cuts to the score and, as a result, only half of the music was heard at the first performance. Henze rescued one of the cuts - the music from the finale to the second act - and derived his fourth symphony from it. In its original operatic context the music was to accompany a scene in which the king, magically transformed into a white stag, has fled into the forest and spends a year there contemplating his future before realising that he must return to the human world.Thomas Schulz (2011), liner notes for Wergo recording Henze wrote the symphony whilst he was teaching at the Darmstadt Summer School for New Music.

It comprised a series of boards of magistrates established in the early 16th century, and existed until the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797. Between 1907 and 2014, the body was revived by the Italian state, with responsibilities extending over the entire Veneto and the Province of Mantua. ==Foundation and history in the Republic of Venice == Situated in the Venetian Lagoon, water was vital to the city and state of Venice: the lagoon and its waterways were vital commercial arteries, but also provided the best defence for the city of Venice and guaranteed its independence. In the Middle Ages, the lagoon was administered by the Curia publicorum, commonly known as the Poviego, established in 1282 by merging previous boards charged with the maintenance of the city's canals. The Poviego shared this role with the Provveditori di Com√∫n, and in the 15th century with the highest organs of the Venetian government, the Council of Ten and the Venetian Senate. While until the 15th century the city's constant growth meant that the Lagoon was administered from the perspective of an environment of urban expansion and administration, the slowing of that growth gave way to a view that the lagoon had to be preserved. As a result, in 1501 the three-member board of the Savi alle Acque (\\"Wise Men for the Waters\\") was created by the Ten, charged with maintaining the waterways and the lagoon; as the Venetian patrician Girolamo Priuli noted, with some exaggeration, their chief task was to \\"keep the lagoon from becoming mainland\\". The Savi were an executive council, followed in 1505 by the much larger Collegio delle Acque (\\"College of the Waters\\"), which took over decision-making on hydraulical matters from the Ten and the Senate. Along with the Savi, the Collegio also comprised the Doge of Venice himself, and a number of other members, usually around fifty, usually veteran and high-ranking members of the Venetian government. In 1521, another three-member board, the Esecutori alle Acque (\\"Executors on the Waters\\") was created. Finally, in 1678, the position of Inquisitore was established. Like most magistracies of the Venetian Republic, these councils were filled by election for fixed terms exclusively from among the Venetian patriciate. To provide expert assistance, the magistracy employed a number of professional personnel, including secretarial staff and hydraulic technicians. Known as the periti or proti (sing. proto), these were drawn from the burghers (cittadini ordinari) and held their position for life. From 1542, the post of a Matematico pubblico (\\"Public Mathematician\\") was also instituted to provide expert advice. In addition, in a semi-ritualized practice, the Collegio delle Acque employed the advice of eight experienced fishermen nominated from the fishing guilds of the Lagoon's main settlements. The duties of the magistracy were to keep the Lagoon from silting up, maintain the entries to the Lagoon open for navigation, maintain the sandbars (lidi) intact, and regulate the rivers flowing into the Lagoon. In addition, the magistracy also had a fiscal aspect, as it was responsible for the collection of a five percent inheritance tax, through which it financed its work. The importance of the Lagoon for Venice also meant that the Magistrato alle Acque enjoyed a higher authority and priority than other competing agencies, most notably the Provveditori sopra Beni Inculti, founded in 1556 to promote the cultivation of lands in Venice's mainland possessions in the Veneto: on issues related to the management of the rivers feeding the Lagoon, the Magistrato alle Acque invariably had the final say, leading to aborted requests for irrigation, or canalization of the Sile, Brenta, and Piave rivers in ways that ensured the uninterrupted supply of the Lagoon, but exposed their surroundings to frequent flooding. == The Magistrato alle Acque in modern Italy == The original Magistrato alle Acque disappeared with the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, but in 1907, the magistracy was re-established by the Italian state as a public institution. The Magistrato alle Acque was led by a chairman named by the President of the Italian Republic in agreement with the council of ministers. Its seat was in the Palazzo dei Dieci Savi Venice, and it managed the entirety of Triveneto basin. Its powers are primarily exercised over the Veneto region as well as the Province of Mantua. However, for external projects that may affect its area of interest, the Magistrato alle Acque may extend its authority until the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige as well as the region Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The governance of this institution remain based around the surveillance of the lagoon area but may now concern the operations of desalination, improvement, and port regulation. It was abolished in 2014 in the wake of a corruption scandal in the MOSE Project. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Government of the Republic of Venice Category:Venetian Lagoon Category:16th-century establishments in the Republic of Venice Category:1907 establishments in Italy Category:2014 disestablishments in Italy Category:Water management authorities ","title":"Magistrato alle Acque"},{"id":"60293082","text":"Should a Wife Forgive? is a 1915 American silent drama film directed by Henry King and starring Lillian Lorraine, Mabel Van Buren and Lew Cody.Guide to the Silent Years of American Cinema p.84 ==Cast== * Lillian Lorraine as La Belle Rose * Mabel Van Buren as Mary Holmes * Henry King as Jack Holmes * Lew Cody as Alfred Bedford * William Lampe as Dr. Charles Hoffman * Mollie McConnell as Mrs. Forrester * Fred Whitman as Reggy Stratford * Daniel Gilfether as Henry Wilson * Marie Osborne as Robert Holmes, baby ==References== ==Bibliography== * Donald W.

The government does not keep records of religiously motivated violence, and reporting from individual religious organization is sparse.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Serbia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The laws of Serbia establish the freedom of religion, forbid the establishment of a state religion, and outlaw religious discrimination. While registration with the government, is not necessary for religious groups to practice, the government confers certain privileges to registered groups. The government maintains a two-tiered system of registered groups, split between \\"traditional\\" groups and \\"nontraditional\\" groups. Minority groups and independent observers have complained that this system consists of religious discrimination.

The media and individual members of parliament have been criticized for using disparaging language when referring to non-traditional groups Antisemitic literature is commonly available in bookstores, and is prevalent online. Although religious freedom was largely respected by the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Serbia's constitutions through its various incarnations as either an independent state or as part of Yugoslavia have nominally upheld religious freedom, it was also the site of significant religiously and ethnically- motivated war crimes during World War IITomasevich, Jozo (2001).

The remaining 6 percent includes Jews, Buddhists, members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, agnostics, atheists, other religious groups, and individuals without a declared religious affiliation. The vast majority of the population identifying as Orthodox Christian are members of the Serbian Orthodox Church, a category not specifically listed in the census. Adherents of the Macedonian, Montenegrin, and Romanian Orthodox Churches may be included in the numbers of ‚ÄúOrthodox Christians‚Äù or in the ‚Äúother Christian‚Äù category that is part of the remaining 6 percent, depending on how they self-identify. Catholics are predominantly ethnic Hungarians and Croats residing in Vojvodina Province. Muslims include Bosniaks (Slavic Muslims) in the southwest Sandzak region, ethnic Albanians in the south, and Romani people located throughout the country. ==History== ===Independence from the Ottoman Empire=== Prior to two uprisings in the early 19th century which culminated in the establishment of a mostly autonomous Serbian state which remained a vassal to the Ottoman Empire in 1815, Serbia had been occupied by the Ottoman Empire for 300 years (barring brief occupations by Austria). Under Ottoman rule, Serbian Christians were forced to pay religious taxes and were treated as second-class citizens. Following partial independence in 1815, the Serbian Orthodox Church was reestablished. Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, the head of state, supported policies that promoted secularism in order to curb the Church's power over his authority. Following the Herzegovina uprising of 1875, Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, seeking its full independence in what would become known as the Serbian-Turkish Wars. During the conflict, Serbian forces expelled between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, from Serbia.Stefanoviƒá, Djordje (2005). \\"Seeing the Albanians through Serbian eyes: The Inventors of the Tradition of Intolerance and their Critics, 1804‚Äì1939.\\" European History Quarterly. 35.

The largest religious denomination was Eastern Orthodoxy (approximately 50% of the population), followed by Catholicism (approximately 40%), with the greater part of the remainder professing Islam.Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past, George W. White, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, , p. 236. Muslims faced prejudice from the other religious groups, but were granted some concessions from the government, such as the establishment of enclaves which were governed by Islamic Law. A small Jewish population was also present in the kingdom, and were generally treated well by the rest of the population and the government. A constitution was passed in 1921, which led to an increase of tensions between ethno-religious blocs.Spencer Tucker. Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC- CLIO, 2005. Pp. 1189. Prime Minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá used the police to suppress opposition groups and ethnic minorities,Balkan Politics , Time, 31 March 1923 particularly the Catholic Croats, who were the primary opposition against his goal of a highly centralized, Serb-dominated state.The Opposition , Time, 6 April 1925 In 1928, a Serb representative in parliament opened fire against the opposition bench, killing Stjepan Radiƒá of the Croatian Peasant Party. King Alexander I used this as a pretext to ban national political parties, abolish the constitution and convert the country to a personal dictatorship, as well as renaming it the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and reorganizing the country's internal administration. Alexander I attempted to reduce ethnoreligious separatism by promoting a unified Yugoslav nationalism, a political strategy which ultimately both alienated the Serbs and failed to mollify the Croats. The 1930s saw the rise of the Ustashe, a Croat fascist organization which advocated the establishment of an independent Croatian state through violent means, and which embarked on a terrorist campaign of bombings, assassinations, and sabotage. In 1931, Alexander I adopted a new constitution, which enshrined the freedom of religion, but also established a unitary state, which was perceived by non-Serbs as a cover for Serbian dominion over the state. Representatives of the various minority groups issued declarations demanding the establishment of a new constitution. The government responded to both the Ustashe insurgency and the political pronouncements with often violent police action, which only further bolstered support for separatist groups. In October 1934, Alexander I was assassinated by a Bulgarian-Macedonian nationalist\\"The suicide-assassin from VMRO was Vlado Cernozemski, who on orders from Mihajlov and his ethno-national VMRO, which was defined as Bulgarian, killed the Yugoslav king Alexander I Karadzordzevic and the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Louis Bareau in Marseille in 1934.\\" New Balkan Politics, Issue 6, 2003, Stefan Troebst, Historical Politics and Historical \\"Masterpieces\\" in Macedonia before and after 1991. who had contacts with the Ustashe.Bennett Kovrig \\"Mediation by Obfuscation: The Resolution of the Marseille Crisis, October 1934 to May 1935\\" pages 191-221, The Historical Journal, Volume 19, Issue 1, January 1976 pg. 196. Following Alexander I's death, Yugoslavia entered a regency led by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. Paul attempted to pursue a policy of democracy and decentralization in the hopes of mollifying Serb and Croat nationalists. In 1941, Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers, a decision which was met with massive opposition by the Serb population, as well as Liberals and communists of all nationalities. A military coup forced Paul to resign and placed 17-year-old Peter II on the throne. This would soon prompt a German invasion.International Military Tribunal, The Trial of German Major War Criminals, Judgement: The Aggression Against Yugoslavia And Greece, p. 32. === World War II === Following German invasion, Yugoslavia was divided between the Axis powers, as well as a newly created Croatian puppet state led by the Ustashe.Hungary profile , Shoah Foundation Institute Visual History Archive; usc.edu; accessed 4 December 2015. The anti-Axis resistance movement was split into two major groups: royalist Chetniks and communist Partisans. As the country descended into what was effectively a civil war, there was an immense amount of ethno- religiously motivated violence. The majority of the Jewish population of Yugoslavia was killed by Axis-aligned forces, with only 17% surviving the war. Ustashe and German troops massacred Orthodox Serb civilians, while Chetnik militias targeted (Catholic) Croats and Muslims. ===Socialist Yugoslavia=== Following the end of World War II, Serbia was reconstituted as part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which established a nominally secular state (although at times it displayed favoritism toward the Serbian Orthodox Church), and did not engage in anti-religious campaigns to the extent of other countries in the Eastern Bloc. In the late 1980s, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá became one of the most powerful politicians in the country. Despite having a previous reputation as a hard-line communist anti-nationalist, Lampe, John R. 2000. Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p347 Milo≈°eviƒá pivoted toward Serbian nationalism, and repressed demands for cultural autonomy from Yugoslavia's other ethnic groups. This in turn further motivated calls for independence from non-Serb ethnic groups, culminating in overwhelmingly successful independence referendums in Croatia and Slovenia in 1991 and 1990 respectively. === Dissolution of Yugoslavia (1991 ‚Äì 2006) === Yugoslavia broke apart in a series of wars over the course of the 1990s. Serbia provided significant material support to the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Serb paramilitary forces, which in turn committed numerous war crimes, many of which were motivated by enmities along ethnic and religious lines, primarily targeting Albanians, Croats, and Bosniaks. Charges included the deliberate targeting of civilians, mass rape and genocide, among others. === Republic of Serbia (2006 ‚Äì present) === In 2006, Serbia adopted a new constitution, replacing a previous constitution passed in 1990. This constitution continues to guarantee the freedom of belief and religion. Kosovo, which had been home to most of Serbia's Muslim population, unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Human rights watchdog organizations have criticized Serbia's reticence in complying with war crime investigations for its actions during the wars of Yugoslav dissolution.Serbia/Kosovo: Events of 2018. Human Rights Watch == Legal framework == The constitution guarantees the freedom of belief and religion as well as the right to change one‚Äôs religion. It states everyone shall have the freedom to worship and practice religion individually or with others, in private or in public, and no one shall be obliged to declare one‚Äôs religion. The constitution states the freedom to express one‚Äôs religion or beliefs may be restricted by law only as necessary to protect the lives and health of the people, the morals of democratic society, freedoms and rights guaranteed by the constitution, or public safety and order or prevent incitement of religious, national, or racial hatred. The constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion, guarantees equality for religious groups, and calls for separation of religion and state. It states churches and religious communities shall be free to organize their internal structure, perform religious rites in public, establish and manage religious schools and social and charity institutions in accordance with the law. The constitution recognizes the right of conscientious objection based on religious beliefs. It states no person shall be obliged to perform military or any other service involving the use of weapons if this is inconsistent with his or her religion or beliefs, but that a conscientious objector may be called upon to fulfill military duty not involving carrying weapons. === Anti-discrimination laws === The constitution prohibits religious discrimination or incitement of religious hatred, calls upon the government to promote religious diversity and tolerance, and states that religious refugees have a right to asylum, the procedures for which shall be established in law. The law bans incitement of discrimination, hatred, or violence against an individual or group on religious grounds and carries penalties ranging from one to 10 years in prison, depending on the type of offense. === Recognized religious groups === ==== \\"Traditional\\" groups ==== The law grants special treatment to seven religious groups defined as ‚Äútraditional‚Äù by the government. These are the Serbian Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, Slovak Evangelical Church, Reformed Christian Church, Evangelical Christian Church, the Islamic community, and the Jewish community. ‚ÄúChurch‚Äù is a term reserved for Christian religious groups, while the term ‚Äúreligious community‚Äù refers to non-Christian groups and to some Christian entities. The Islamic community is divided between the Islamic Community of Serbia (emphasis added), with its seat in Belgrade, and the Islamic Community in Serbia, with its seat in Novi Pazar. Although the law generally prohibits the registration of multiple groups with the same name, both Islamic communities are officially registered with the government. The seven traditional religious groups recognized by law are automatically registered in the Register of Churches and Religious Communities. In addition to these groups, the government grants traditional status, solely in Vojvodina Province, to the Diocese of Dacia Felix of the Romanian Orthodox Church, with its seat in Romania and administrative seat in Vr≈°ac in Vojvodina. The law also grants the seven traditional religious groups the right to receive value-added tax refunds, to have their faith taught in public schools, and to provide chaplain services to military personnel. ==== \\"Nontraditional\\" groups ==== There are 20 ‚Äúnontraditional‚Äù religious groups registered with the government: the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Evangelical Methodist Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Evangelical Church in Serbia, Church of Christ‚Äôs Love, Spiritual Church of Christ, Union of Christian Baptist Churches in Serbia, Nazarene Christian Religious Community (associated with the Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarene)), Church of God in Serbia, Protestant Christian Community in Serbia, Church of Christ Brethren in Serbia, Free Belgrade Church, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, Zion Sacrament Church, Union of Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement, Protestant Evangelical Church Spiritual Center, Evangelical Church of Christ, the Slovak Union of Baptist Churches, Union of Baptist Churches in Serbia, and Charismatic Community of Faith in Serbia. Several of these organizations are umbrella groups that oversee many individual churches, sometimes of slightly differing affiliations. ==== Religious group registration ==== The law does not require religious groups to register, but it treats unregistered religious organizations as informal groups that do not receive any of the legal benefits registered religious groups receive. For example, only registered religious groups may build new places of worship, own property, apply for property restitution, or receive state funding for their activities. Registration is also required for opening bank accounts and hiring staff. The law authorizes the government to provide social and health insurance and fund retirement plans only for religious clerics of registered groups. The law also grants property tax exemptions to all registered groups. Registered religious groups are exempt from paying administrative taxes and filing annual financial reports. To obtain registration a group is required to submit the following: the names, identity numbers, copies of notarized identity documents, and signatures of at least 100 citizen members of the group; the group‚Äôs statutes and a summary of its religious teachings, ceremonies, religious goals, and basic activities; and information on sources of funding. The law prohibits registration if an applicant group‚Äôs name includes part of the name of an existing registered group. The Ministry of Justice maintains the Register of Churches and Religious Communities and responds to registration applications. ==== Criticism ==== Minority religious groups and non-governmental observers continued to state the law was inherently biased in differentiating between so-called traditional and nontraditional religious groups. They also stated the laws governing churches and religious communities were in conflict with constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and equal status among religious groups. For example, in addition to the benefits traditional religious groups received according to law, the government provided those groups with financial support for religious events and publication or printing of religious materials. Minority groups also cited an inequitable distribution of government scholarships, at all educational levels, among religious groups. They stated the Directorate for Cooperation with Churches and Religious Communities, which provided support to religious groups, had the additional mandate of protecting the Serbian national identity and cooperating with Serbian Orthodox Church eparchies abroad. In addition, the Roman Catholic Church, a traditional church, complained about what it said was preferential treatment of the Serbian Orthodox Church. === Restrictions and oversight === According to the constitution, the Constitutional Court may ban a religious community for activities infringing on the right to life or health, the rights of the child, the right to personal and family integrity, public safety, and order, or if it incites religious, national, or racial intolerance. It also states the Constitutional Court may ban an association that incites religious hatred. The Ministry of Justice's Directorate for Cooperation with Churches and Religious Communities manages all expert and administrative matters pertaining to the cooperation of the state with churches and religious communities. These includes assistance to national minorities in protecting the religious traditions integral to their cultural and ethnic identity; cooperation between the state and Serbian Orthodox dioceses abroad; support for religious education; and support for and protection of the legal standing of churches and religious communities. The government‚Äôs Office for Human and Minority Rights, which addresses policy and monitors the status of minorities, also oversees some religious issues. == Government practices == According to the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, public prosecutors rarely prosecuted physical assaults against their members or vandalism against their property as religiously motivated crimes, but rather as simple assault or property violations, which carried lesser penalties under the law than religiously motivated crimes, or else treated incidents as private disputes. Some observers stated they believed prosecutors intentionally filed lesser charges in these cases to minimize the appearance of religious intolerance. The law recognizes restitution claims for religious property confiscated in 1945 or later for registered religious groups only. The law permits individual claims for properties lost by Holocaust victims during WWII, but religious groups may not claim property confiscated prior to 1945. Legally registered endowments may apply for restitution. The law also provides that the Jewish community may receive restitution for heirless property confiscated from Holocaust victims during WWII. Due to the division of the Islamic community between the Islamic Community of Serbia and the Islamic Community in Serbia, Islamic organizations face difficulty in getting property restituted, as it would require the government to recognize one or the other group as the \\"rightful\\" Islamic community of the country. As of 2017, the government reports that roughly 70 percent of the property confiscated by the government of Yugoslavia has been returned. The government does not keep records of religiously motivated violence, and reporting from individual religious organization is sparse. == Education == The constitution states parents and legal guardians shall have the right to ensure the religious education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. The law provides for religious education in public schools, but only for the seven traditional groups. Students in primary and secondary schools must attend classes in one of the seven traditional religions or an alternative civic education class. Parents choose which option is appropriate for their child. The curriculum taught in the religion classes varies regionally, reflecting the number of adherents of a given religion in a specific community. Typically, five interested students is the minimum needed to offer instruction in a particular religion. In areas where individual schools do not meet the minimum number, the Ministry of Education attempts to combine students into regional classes for religious instruction. The Commission for Religious Education appoints religious education instructors from lists of qualified candidates supplied by each religious group. The commission is composed of representatives of each traditional religious group, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and the Directorate for Cooperation with Churches and Religious Communities. Representatives of the Islamic Community of Serbia and the Islamic Community in Serbia participate in the work of the commission. == Societal attitudes == Jehovah's Witnesses have reported incidences of assault and harassment against their members. Translations of antisemitic literature are available from nationalist groups and publishers. Antisemitic literature, such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, is available in many bookshops, and antisemitism is present on social media. Some youth groups and internet forums promote antisemitic speech. Articles critical of nontraditional religious groups regularly appear in online media. Several nontraditional religious leaders reported the media often labeled nontraditional religions as ‚Äúsects,‚Äù which the leaders stated contributed to negative stereotyping. Members of Parliament have also labeled nontraditional groups, particularly Protestant groups, as sects. == References == == Bibliography == * Crampton, Richard (1997).

For example, while LTL allows to state that each event p is eventually followed by an event q, TPTL furthermore allows to give a time limit for q to occur. == Syntax == The future fragment of TPTL is defined similarly to linear temporal logic, in which furthermore, clock variables can be introduced and compared to constants. Formally, given a set X of clocks, MTL is built up from: * a finite set of propositional variables AP, * the logical operators ¬¨ and ‚à®, and * the temporal modal operator U, * a clock comparison x\\\\sim c, with x\\\\in X, c a number and \\\\sim being a comparison operator such as <, ‚â§, =, ‚â• or >. * a freeze quantification operator x.\\\\phi, for \\\\phi a TPTL formula with set of clocks X\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}. Furthermore, for I=(a,b) an interval, x\\\\in I is considered as an abbreviation for x>a\\\\land x; and similarly for every other kind of intervals. The logic TPTL+Past is built as the future fragment of TLS and also contains * the temporal modal operator S. Note that the next operator N is not considered to be a part of MTL syntax. It will instead be defined from other operators. A closed formula is a formula over an empty set of clocks. == Model == Let T\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb R_+ it intuitively represents a set of time. Let \\\\gamma: T\\\\to \\\\mathcal P(AP) a function which associate to each moment t\\\\in T a set of propositions from AP. A model of a TPTL formula is such a function \\\\gamma. Usually, \\\\gamma is either a timed word or a signal. In those cases, T is either a discrete subset or an interval containing 0. == Semantic == Let T and \\\\gamma as above. Let X a set of clocks. Let u:X\\\\to\\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0} a clock valuation over X. We are now going to explain what it means that a TPTL formula \\\\phi holds at time t for a valuation u. This is denoted by \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi. Let \\\\phi and \\\\psi be two formulas over the set of clocks X, \\\\xi a formula over the set of clocks X\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\}, x\\\\in X, l\\\\in\\\\mathtt{AP}, c a number and \\\\sim being a comparison operator such as <, ‚â§, =, ‚â• or >: We first consider formulas whose main operator also belongs to LTL: * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models l holds if l\\\\in\\\\gamma(t), * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models eg\\\\phi holds if either \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi or \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\psi * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi\\\\lor\\\\psi holds if either \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi or \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\psi * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\psi holds if there exists t such that \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\psi and such that for each t< t'< t, \\\\gamma,t', u\\\\models\\\\phi, * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\phi\\\\mathcal S\\\\psi holds if there exists t< t such that \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models\\\\psi and such that for each t, \\\\gamma,t', u\\\\models\\\\phi, * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models y.\\\\xi holds if \\\\gamma,t, u[y\\\\to t]\\\\models\\\\phi holds, * \\\\gamma,t, u\\\\models x\\\\sim c holds if t- u(y)\\\\sim c. == Metric temporal logic == Metric temporal logic is another extension of LTL which allow to measure time. Instead of adding variables, it adds an infinity of operators \\\\mathcal U_I and \\\\mathcal S_I for I an interval of non-negative number. The semantic of the formula \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\psi at some time t is essentially the same than the semantic of the formula \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\psi, with the constraints that the time t at which \\\\psi must hold occurs in the interval t+I. TPTL is as least as expressive as MTL. Indeed, the MTL formula \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\psi is equivalent to the TPTL formula x.\\\\phi\\\\mathcal(x\\\\in I\\\\land\\\\psi) where x is a new variable. It follows that any other operator introduced in the page MTL, such as \\\\Box and \\\\Diamond can also be defined as TPTL formulas. TPTL is strictly more expressive than MTL both over timed words and over signals. Over timed words, no MTL formula is equivalent to \\\\Box(a\\\\implies x.\\\\Diamond(b\\\\land\\\\Diamond(c\\\\land x\\\\le 5))). Over signal, there are no MTL formula equivalent to x.\\\\Diamond(a\\\\land x\\\\le 1\\\\land\\\\Box(x\\\\le 1\\\\implies eg b)), which states that the last atomic proposition before time point 1 is an a. == Comparison with LTL == A standard (untimed) infinite word w=a_0,a_1,\\\\dots, is a function from \\\\mathbb N to A. We can consider such a word using the set of time T=\\\\mathbb N, and the function \\\\gamma(i)=a_i. In this case, for \\\\phi an arbitrary LTL formula, w,i\\\\models\\\\phi if and only if \\\\gamma,i, u\\\\models\\\\phi, where \\\\phi is considered as a TPTL formula with non-strict operator, and u is the only function defined on the empty set. ==References== Category:Temporal logic Category:Model checking ","title":"Timed propositional temporal logic"},{"id":"60293164","text":"Russula firmula is a type of fungus found mostly in Europe, extending into parts of Asia.

In the words of one commentator, she \\"moves in a space between scholarship and journalism\\". Since 1993 she has also appeared regularly on broadcast media. In 2014 the German government wanted to award her the \\"Bundesverdienstkreuz\\". She rejected the state decoration explaining in an open letter to the then President of Germany Joachim Gauck that although the honour came in recognition of her many years of unpaid work on women's issues and policies, along with Franco-German co-operation and international co-operation more generally, her work had frequently placed her in direct opposition to whichever one of a succession of German governments was in power at the time. ==Biography== Florence Herv√© was born at Boulogne-sur-Seine, a western suburb of Paris dominated by the automobile industry. She grew up in a conservative but relatively open-minded family in the suburb of Ville-d'Avray, a short distance to the west of Boulogne. Passing her Abitur (school final exams) in 1961 opened the way to university level education. She studied Germanistics at Bonn, Heidelberg and Paris, from where she received her doctorate.Autoren wider den Zeitgeist: \\"Kein Frieden mit dieser Politik\\", in: junge Welt, 1 April 2016. Along the way she had also, in 1963, received a degree as a translator from the Dolmetsch Institute (specialising in simultaneous translation) at the University of Heidelberg. Herv√© has worked as a freelance journalist since 1969. She has contributed to a range of mainly left-of-center publications, including R√©forme, Deutsche Volkszeitung, Frankfurter Rundschau, K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger and Junge Welt. She also became involved in various feminist organisations and initiatives. In the mid-1970s she was a co-founder with Alma Kettig of the Democratic Women's Initiative (\\"Demokratische Fraueninitiative\\"). She is a co-producer of the feminist quarterly journal Wir Frauen and of the publication's calendar, produced since 1979. Since 1975 she has also engaged in the feminist movement across Europe and internationally as a member of the leadership team in the Women's International Democratic Federation between 1994 and 2002, and between 1996 and 2004 in the feminist \\"Freedom for Leyla Zana\\" initiative. Issues on which her work as an author and editor focuses include confrontation with fascism and colonialism, the history of anti-fascist resistance and the conditions of women in the global south and north.

The illegal dumping released toxic fumes, affecting 6,000 people and hospitalising 2,775. Most of the victims were school students‚Äî110 schools located near the river were subsequently closed. == Background of pollution == The incident started on 7 March 2019 after several students and canteen workers from two schools near the river began to fall ill and complaining of breathing difficulties. Both schools were ordered to shut down and all the victims were sent to Sultan Ismail Hospital while investigations were being carried out by state health authorities over the cause. Twenty-one people were warded at the hospital with some being admitted into the emergency unit and intensive care unit (ICU). Some of the students brought to the hospital were already fainted and with symptoms such as vomiting. Those who were not seriously affected were given outpatient treatment and allowed to return home. During recovery, some of the seriously affected victims shared their experience of suddenly being ill after inhaling unpleasant odour in their school compound. The number of victims hospitalised over the toxic fumes rose to 76 on the following day and on 9 March 2019, five police reports have been made on the issue with police began investigating the case. === Further spread of toxic fumes and water pollution === On 11 March, the second wave of air poisoning took effect with further 106‚Äì207 victims hospitalised before escalating into more than 1,000 victims with eight admitted into the ICU. The spread of the toxic fumes was aided by hot weather combined with strong winds, which made more people sick. The Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department director-general Mohammad Hamdan Wahid explained that the further spread of toxic fumes could have been prevented if the illegally dumped chemicals found earlier were immediately removed. However, the authorities did not dispose the chemicals after concluding it was no longer reactive, allegedly due to the costs involved. Until 19 March, further 76 police reports have been made. On 20 June, about 3 months since the pollution first discovered, a number of students from schools in the Pasir Gudang area began complaining of nausea, dizziness and experienced vomiting which eventually led to the temporary closure of the schools in the area. The authorities later confirmed it as the third wave of air poisoning resulted from the river pollution, which were not fully cleared. In August 2019, residents in Acheh's Well Village near the Daing and Kopok rivers (tributaries to the Kim Kim River) complained that the water in both rivers have turned black and oily with unbearable foul stench which were believed to have spread from the chemical pollution of the Kim Kim River. A resident interviewed on the issue said the rivers were once homes to various crabs, freshwater fish and shrimps with children used to swim in, but everything has been damaged since the pollution turned worse in April. == Investigation, clearance works and arrestment of perpetrators == Through investigations, it was believed that the chemical wastes were dumped from a lorry tanker into the Kim Kim River in wee hours, on the same day before the victims fell ill. Agencies dispatched for the cleaning-up operation of the polluted river collected 2.43 tonnes of chemical waste on the day the incident was reported. The cleaning works, however, worsened the chemical reaction, as the contractor engaged was not experienced in dealing with chemical wastes. A Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) team from the 12th Squadron of the Royal Army Engineers Regiment of Malaysian Armed Forces was later dispatched to assist in the chemical cleaning efforts together with a Hazmat team. The Johor Department of Environment (DOE) arrested an owner of a chemical factory in Kulai on 10 March followed by another arrest involving shredded waste factory owner and one of its workers in Taman Pasir Puteh on the following day after a series of investigations. With the arrests, the DOE completed its investigation papers and were sent to the public prosecutor for further action, with the investigators also have identified the illegally dumped chemical as marine oil that emitted flammable methane and benzene fumes. The oil is categorised as a scheduled waste and needs proper disposal due to its hazardous nature. On 17 March, nine more people were arrested by the police in connection to the case; two arrested in Johor Bahru while seven were arrested outside the Johor Bahru area. Two key suspects, believed to be instrumental in arranging for the transportation of the toxic substances, were arrested on 19 March, bringing the total arrests to 11 with one suspect later released under bail after he is proven to be unrelated to the case. The cleaning operation of the 1.5 kilometre stretch of the affected river was completed in the same day, where a total of 900 tonnes of soil and 1,500 tonnes of polluted water were cleaned. Several other identified toxic gases emitted (following the interaction of the chemicals concerned with water and air) include acrolein, acrylonitrile, ethylbenzene, hydrogen chloride, D-limonene, toluene and xylene, which if inhaled, can cause headache, nausea, fainting and breathing difficulty. Two main suspects (a Singaporean and a Malaysian) were charged at the Sessions Court in Johor on 25 March for illegal disposal of chemicals into the river and their company, P Tech Resources was slapped with 15 charges to which they pleaded not guilty. Both have been charged earlier in the same court for conspiring with a lorry driver to dispose the scheduled wastes into the river. == Government and health authorities response == Johor's Sultan Ibrahim Ismail urged for an immediate action against the perpetrators involved in this pollution that endangered public lives while expressing his appreciation for the medical teams which had been working tirelessly to treat the victims in hospital. The Sultan has pledged a total of RM1 million (around US$250,000) towards helping rescue agencies and authorities to gather the necessary means and equipment to resolve the matter, meanwhile expressing his view that the incident shows the need for a government hospital to be built in Pasir Gudang. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail visited victims of the pollution at the hospital in Johor Bahru on 14 March, and said that the situation was \\"under control\\" where residents are not necessary to be evacuated from the area and also that there is a need to review the country's Environmental Quality Act 1974 in light of the serious pollution. The federal government has approved an allocation of RM8 million for river purification works and has ordered various agencies including the police, military and Hazmat teams to support the situation in the affected area. They explained that there was no request for a state of emergency received from the state government of Johor. Johor's Menteri Besar Osman Sapian were in the opinion that the situation is under control without the need to declare a state of emergency in the area with the state government has approved an emergency allocation of RM6.4 million for cleaning up the affected river. Malaysia's Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin stressed that investigation will be carried out to bring those responsible to justice and explained that the RM6.4 million is mainly used to clear the 1.5 kilometre stretch of the affected river with further cost expected to balloon to over RM10 million. The state government also dismissed claims that its agencies were slow to react over the incident. The State Health Department had also warned the public not to circulate fake news, with an ongoing one saying deaths had been resulted from the pollution. On 1 June, Malaysia's Health Ministry formed a medical team, which consists of officers from the Institute for Medical Research and Johor Health Department, to examine a total of 6,000 victims affected by the pollution . Malaysia's Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister Xavier Jayakumar Arulanandam urged every state governments to take serious measures to overcome river pollution as climate change could cause the country to experience long periods of drought in the future. The ministry also drafted a Water Resources Bill to clamp down on water pollution. Neighbouring authorities in Singapore continue to monitor the situation following the reports of more illegal waste dumping sites found in Pasir Gudang. Various Singapore agencies have been conducting regular checks with a minister explained that they were taking the matter very seriously as what happened in Malaysia can affect Singapore significantly. === Criticism of government response and lawsuits === Johor's Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Idris took the matter to Twitter to express his opinion that the government should have instead declared a state of emergency on the day it first occurred and relocated residents to a temporary place until there was a guarantee that the area was safe. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak called out the state government's slow response on the pollution and the refusal of the current Pakatan Harapan (PH) government to allocate more funds to clear the affected river, and these actions were seen as if they prioritised money, rather than the lives and health of the people. Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) Deputy President Mah Hang Soon said that the incompetent preventive measures escalated the hazard levels in the involved area. In July 2019, a boy was reported to have developed Parkinson's-like disease of myokymia after being exposed to the pollution, although this was denied by Malaysia's Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye who said that the boy was born prematured and had a history of fits since he was four. A group of 160 victims of the pollution then began to filed a suit and taking the Johor Menteri Besar along with the state government to court to seek monetary compensation for the boy and other damages caused by the illegal dumping of toxic chemicals. === Other responses === A chemical company Lotte Chemical Titan Holdings Bhd had denied rumours that they are involved in the pollution of Kim Kim River. In a statement to Bursa Malaysia, Lotte Chemical Titan stated in detail: \\"The company hereby denies rumours and wishes to announce that it has no involvement with the incident\\". Malaysian singer Indah Ruhaila expressed concern over the incident as her parents live in the affected area where she also persuaded her parents to leave their homes, worrying of the reoccurrence of the incident. == See also == * Water pollution == Further reading == * * == References == == External links == * Illegal chemical disposal case at Kim Kim River, Pasir Gudang ‚Äì Press release from the Department of Environment, Malaysia * Pasir Gudang Municipal Council Press Release ‚Äì Recent information on the Kim Kim River pollution from the Government of Johor Category:Environmental issues in Malaysia Category:Health disasters in Malaysia Category:Water pollution in Malaysia Category:2019 in Malaysia Category:March 2019 crimes in Asia Category:Man-made disasters in Malaysia ","title":"2019 Kim Kim River toxic pollution"},{"id":"60293210","text":"Walter Pilling (18 April 1935 - June 1999) was a British wrestler.

Following the referendum of 23 June 2016, in which the electorate of the United Kingdom voted by 17,410,742 to 16,141,241 to leave the European Union, the United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 occurred on 29 March 2017. This set a deadline for leaving the EU of 29 March 2019 which was later extended to 31 October 2019. By 24 March 2019, the petition had received 5 million signatures, and is the most-signed petition to the UK parliament on record; it reached 6 million on 31 March, and closed on 20 August with a total of 6,103,056 signatures. == Background == On Thursday 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which the electorate voted, by 17,410,742 to 16,141,241 to leave the European Union, with a turnout of 72.2%. As a result, on 29 March 2017 the UK Government invoked Article 50 to inform the European Council that they intended to leave the union on 29 March 2019. The European Council subsequently agreed that this deadline could be extended, and UK law changes are planned to do that. Following a ruling in December 2018 by the European Court of Justice that the United Kingdom may legally revoke Article 50, the petition to do so was started on 20 February 2019 by a former college lecturer. At first slow to accrue signatures, it grew in popularity after British Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that she would not be asking the EU for a prolonged extension to Article 50. == Objective == The petition directly asks the government to revoke article 50 and therefore keep the United Kingdom in the European Union. It reads: ‚ÄúThe government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is the will of the people. We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now for remaining in the EU. A people‚Äôs vote may not happen, so vote now.‚Äù == Support == On 21 March 2019 the petition reached one million signatures and had the highest recorded rate of any petition on the UK Parliament petitions website, almost 2,000 per minute, causing the site to crash due to high site traffic. It passed 4.5 million signatures on 23 March ‚Äì the day that an estimated one million people protested in favour of a \\"People's Vote\\" in London ‚Äì becoming the most-signed UK Parliament online petition, surpassing the previous record of 4,150,262 signatures. It is also considered to be the most-signed petition to the UK parliament of any type on record, surpassing a petition from 1990 that protested reductions to the ambulance service, which was signed by 4.5 million people. On 24 March the petition surpassed 5 million signatures. On 31 March it reached 6 million signatures. The BBC cited expert opinions that the petition was unlikely to have been adversely affected by bots, as prior petitions had been. A Channel 4 report stated that it was possible to sign the petition using a false identity, but concluded that such manipulation would be reasonably obvious if it were being done on a large scale. It found no evidence of people boasting about hacking this petition in online forums, unlike another Brexit-related petition from 2016. === Heat map === A heat map published by gov.uk showed that urban areas with overwhelmingly remain constituencies signed the petition the most times, with especially large proportions of the electorate signing in Bristol, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, London, Cambridge, and Brighton. In contrast, predominantly leave areas such as Walsall North, saw just 2.6% of the electorate signing the petition. People from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, areas that largely voted to \\"remain\\" in the 2016 referendum, were slower to sign the petition, with the exception of Edinburgh which has a large student population. === Notable supporters === A number of celebrities and high-profile politicians have publicly stated that they have signed the petition, including; ====Celebrities==== * Annie Lennox, singer * Brian Cox, physicist * David Mitchell, comedian * David Walliams, actor and comedian * Gary Lineker, footballer * Hugh Grant, actor * Jennifer Saunders, comedian ====Politicians==== * Anna Soubry, Former Leader of The Independent Group for Change * Caroline Lucas MP, Green Party * Chuka Umunna, Liberal Democrats * David Lammy MP, Labour * Emma Dent Coad, Labour * Heidi Allen, Liberal Democrats * Nicola Sturgeon MSP, Leader of the Scottish National Party * Baroness Jenny Jones, Green peer ==Outcomes== The Department for Exiting the European Union responded to the petition on 26 March, stating that it would not revoke Article 50: \\"We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with Parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union. The government acknowledges the considerable number of people who have signed this petition. However, close to three-quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected.\\" The petition was debated in Parliament on 1 April 2019 in its secondary chamber, Westminster Hall. == Petition author == The creator of the petition, 77-year- old Margaret Georgiadou, is a retired college lecturer. She said \\"I became like every other Remainer‚Äìvery frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long.\\" After two days she received death threats but she said her petition aimed to show there was a change in public attitude: \\"I want it to prove it (Brexit) is no longer the will of the people. It was three years ago but the government has become infamous for changing their mind ‚Äì so why can't the people?\\". She reported receiving three anonymous death threats by phone, and a torrent of abuse via social media. ==References== ==External links== * The petition, on Parliament's website ‚Äì this remains open for signatures for six months, i.e. until 20 August 2019. * * The Parliamentary debate on the petition, on Parliament's website Category:Brexit Category:Online petitions Category:2019 in British politics Category:March 2019 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU petition"},{"id":"60293296","text":"Muhammad Siraj-Din (born 11 September 1935) is a Pakistani wrestler.

K. K. Nair was born on 29 December 1920 in Thiruvanathapuram, in the south Indian state of Kerala to Kesava Pillai and Janaky Amma. After graduating in physics from the University of Madras in 1939 with first rank, he started his career as a divisional accountant in the civil service of Travancore where he had the opportunity to work under C.

Later, he worked as an accountant with the telephone department before moving to Secunderabad to join the ordnance factory of the Ministry of Defence in 1943 as a civilian gazetted officer, one among the first four civilian gazetted officers in the British Army and served as a planning officer. He worked at the ordnance factory until 1947 when he quit the job to appear for the Indian Administrative Service examination to join the service in 1949 which brought him in contact with V. P.

Nair died on 27 September 1987, at the age of 66, at Ernakulam, succumbing to cancer, survived by his wife and their three sons. == Legacy and honours == Nair oversaw the development of Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore into one of the major industrial units in Kerala; it was during his tenure that a new Ammonium Sulphate plant, FACT Engineering and Design Organisation (FEDO) and FACT Engineering Works (FEW) were set up and the work on the establishment of another production unit in Ambalamedu was started. He developed the FACT community into a self-sufficient one with own schools and hospitals. He was known to have assisted Kathakali artists such as Kalamandalam Hyderali, Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri, Kalamandalam Kesavan and Kalamandalam Neelakantan Nambisan of which Hyderali served as a faculty at the cultural wing of FACT. Nair wrote his autobiography, Aarodum Paribhavamillathe (With Malice Towards None: The Chronicle of an Era), as a weekly article serial in Kalakaumudi, detailing his experiences during and after his administrative career. The book, while narrating his early administrative days, describes the Indian annexation of Hyderabad, code-named Operation Polo as well as the political differences between Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The book was later translated into English by one of his junior colleagues at FACT, Gopakumar M. Nair. The book had another English translation, too, under the title, The Autobiography of a Bureaucrat, and the translation was done by Meena Das Narayan, a writer and the niece of M. K. K. Nair. His life was chronicled as a television series, Smruthi which was broadcast on Safari TV in 2017. The Kerala Management Association has instituted an annual lecture, M. K. K. Nair Memorial lecture in his honour and a community centre in Eloor, the place where he spent the later days of his career, MKK Nair Memorial Community Hall has been named after him. M. K. K. Nair Foundation, an eponymous organization in his name, has instituted an annual award, M. K. K. Nair Award, for recognising excellence in performing arts. == Controversy == In 1974, cases were registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation alleging abuse of power and corruption. The trial court exonerated him in 1983 and the appeal court acquitted him in 1987, shortly before his death. Years later, D. Babu Paul, a former chief secretary of the Government of Kerala, while delivering the M. K. K. Nayar Memorial lecture, revealed that Nair was being harassed at the behest of a former prime minister of India who happened to come to know about the disparaging comments that Nair had recorded in his personal diary. == Bibliography == * == See also == * Political integration of India * Mir Osman Ali Khan * Razakars (Hyderabad) * V.

It was also banned in the Indian state of West Bengal for two years alleging insult of religious beliefs and obscenity. In March 2018 the book was translated into English and published as Split: A Life by Penguin Random House. ==Controversy== Writer claimed that the book tells about her experiences and works as a doctor, how she became the target of fundamentalists. Dwikhandito or Ko was banned by a Dhaka Court and its copies have been confiscated following a defamation suit moved by a senior Bengali poet and novelist, Syed Shamsul Haq, against the writer. Kolkata based intellectuals, at the instance of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee, had urged the state government to ban the controversial book in the interest of communal amity. At the same time five fatwas were issued against her for writing this book. Sunil Gangopadhayay said in Kolkata that Dwikhandito is not literature. It may be good to read if you are interested in scandals about some writers. But it is not literature. Writer Dibyendu Palit opined that they must have imposed the ban after taking note of the appeal made by Muslim intellectuals who had apprehended that the book might foment communal discord. Several poets and writers, both in Dhaka and Kolkata, say that Nasrin has written a fictitious fantasy about sexual encounters in his book. The Left Front Government banned the book on 28 November 2003 fearing that book could incite communal discord. The then Chief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharya decided to ban the book after consulting intellectuals. CPI (M) leader Anil Biswas said that Dwikhandito may create riot and disturb communal harmony in West Bengal. Kolkata Police had seized about 3,000 copies of the book from its local publisher. Government stated that it contains matters on pages 49 and 50 which could promote enmity, ill-will and hatred between different groups on grounds of religion, punishable under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code. It was alleged that Nasrin's statement in this book on Prophet Mohammad hurts the sentiments of the Muslim community. On 18 November 2003, the Calcutta High Court put out an injunction against publication after a poet, Syed Hasmat Jalal, filed an 11 crore INR defamation suit against Nasrin.

She is known for popularizing Hawaiian quilting, and is well known in the Hawaiian quilting community. Mrs. Kalama was also an ordained lay pastor under Kahu Dr. Abraham Akaka of Kawaiaha ªo Church - Westminster Abbey of the Pacific. == Early Life == Meali‚Äôi Kalama was born on January 3, 1909 in Honolulu, Hawaii. During her youth, she often watched her grandmother and mother work on their latest quilting project. It was during her childhood that her interest in quilting began to grow. In her teenage years, she expressed her interest in quilting and, following, she spent a year and a half completing her first quilt with a design based on the ulu or breadfruit tree. Kalama pursued her education through attending the University of Hawaii for two years. == Career == === Education === In 1943, Kalama began teaching in the public schools. At this time, she also taught quilting for the Department of Parks and Recreation. In 1950, Kalama left her job to become the first director of a newly opened playground and recreation center. It was said that \\"she could teach kids how to sew, quilt, [or] anything\\". Until her retirement in 1975, she was the Park Director and also taught at \\"Papak≈çlea Playground\\" (known today as Papak≈çlea Community Center) and at other parks, and was a lay minister under Kahu Abraham Akaka at Kawaiahao Church. === Quilting === Kalama was a quilter throughout her lifetime. She created many of her own designs, which were influenced by the style of traditional Hawaiian quilts. Kalama's quilts were also inspired by nature and said herself that \\"all designs must show that flowing gracefulness of nature\\". Kalama was also known for using a creative color palette in her designs. At one point in her life, Laurance S. Rockefeller, founder of the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, commissioned Kalama to create 30 Hawaiian quilts. These quilts took Kalama and other women over 30,000 hours to stitch and were hung in the hotel's corridors. Kalama also made a quilt for Queen Liliuokalani's bed, whose home eventually became the governor's mansion. === Legacy and Awards === Meali'i Kalama is recognized for popularizing Hawaiian quilting, after what was considered to be a long period of disinterest. Many of her quilts have been collected and exhibited by the Museum of International Folk Art and she also has a quilt being held in the Smithsonian Institution. In 1980, the YMCA recognized Kalama \\"for being responsible for the revival of Hawaiian quilting\\". In 1985, Kalama became the first Hawaiian to receive a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. == References == Category:Quilters Category:University of Hawaii alumni Category:1909 births Category:National Heritage Fellowship winners Category:2004 deaths ","title":"Meali ªi Kalama"},{"id":"60293583","text":"The port of Cartagena () is the port located in Cartagena, Murcia.

Regular masonry begins when it was founded by Costa Rican Catholic priest Francisco Calvo, ex-Chaplain General of the Army of Costa Rica during the Filibuster War of 1856, who introduced regular masonry in Central America in 1865. However, there is evidence of the existence of \\"non-regular\\" Lodges active after the Indepenence and before. Prominent Costa Rican figures of politics, literature, art and science, including several presidents of the Republic, were Freemasons. ==History== According to historian Rafael Obreg√≥n Lor√≠a (who was also Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Costa Rica) several lodges were founded in the country before 1865, and there is evidence of legal proceedings in this regard. A citizen of the surname Bolio (surname that later evolves to Volio) appears judicially indicted for heresy because he was a Mason and who confesses repentance, as well as the name of a Venerable Master in office, a foreigner who traveled throughout Central America, and surnamed Echarri. Calvo is initiated into regular Freemasonry when making a trip to Peru and returns to the country. The first regular Masonic Lodge of which there is record, was the Respectful Lodge Charity of Costa Rica, established on June 28, 1865 to be recognized by the Grand Administrative Council of the Grand Orient that issues the respective letter patent. In 1867 the Fraternal Union Lodge was formed, dependent on the Grand Lodge of Columbus in Cuba (regular power also recognized by the Masonic regular power of South Carolina in the US since 1859, and different from the later GOCA in Cuba in 1862 and nationalist and pro-independence in nature), splitting from Charity Lodge for unknown desaveniences, and of which Bruno Carranza would be his venerable master. On January 9, 1871, the 33rd and last Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Central America was founded with headquarters in San Jose, Costa Rica. From Costa Rica, Freemasonry would be promoted to the rest of Central America, linked to the Liberal Revolutions of the 1870s (Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador), and promoting the creation of regular lodges especially Nicaragua and Guatemala. By 1875 there were lodges in the country Charity No. 1, Hope No. 2, Faith No. 3, Fraternal Union No. 7, Progress No. 9, Wonder No. 12, Sincere Friendship No. 18, Disillution No. 14, Concord and the Future, Regeneration No. 6, Fraternal Union N¬∫9, La Luz N¬∫ 12, La Libertad N¬∫ 15 and Phoenix. All these lodges join on December 7, 1879 forming the Grand Lodge of Costa Rica. Most lodges in this stage use the Old and Accepted Scottish Rite, only two use the York Rite, and therefore, all they are exclusively male lodges. The requirements to be a Mason at this time were; being over 21 years of age, knowing how to read and write (something quite common since Costa Rica had high levels of literacy) and being a person of good manners. Most Freemasons at the beginning of the 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie or the small bourgeoisie. Its number of 1865-1899 amounted to 649. Freemasonry spread ideas of humanism, rationalism and the French Enlightenment that quickly became popular among the intellectuals of the time and the ruling classes. In fact the House of Teaching of Santo Tom√°s, founded by the freemason Jos√© Mar√≠a Castro Madriz and whose two first rectors Manuel Arg√ºello Mora (literate, and nephew and foster child of the hero and Benem√©rito Juan Rafael Mora Porras) and Lorenzo Mont√∫far (liberal exiled from Guatemala) were also Masters Masons, taught the Chair of Rationalism in the Faculty of Philosophy. During the presidency of Castro would carry out an important general education reform that included public education funded by the State from the primary education for both sexes and with academic freedom. This promotion of liberal ideas that included the freedom of expression, of conscience and the free debate of ideas promoted during the government of Castro Madriz began to alarm the Catholic Church, which is why the first Bishop of Costa Rica Monsignor Anselmo Llorente y la Fuente is compelled to issue several condemnations to Freemasonry based on the respective papal encyclicals and reaffirms the need of the Church to guide the consciences of the people to avoid Godlessness. Bernardo Soto Alfaro president of Costa Rica, liberal and mason, proclaimed ¬´Granf Protector of the Masonic Order in Costa Rica¬ª. The differences between lodges also seemed to have an impact on the creation of political factions. Thus, while the Charity Lodge emerged the great majority of Castro Madriz's ministers, after the schism that arose in this Lodge and the emergence of Fraternal Union, the opposition to Castro Madriz consisted largely of members of the latter, many of whom supported his overthrowing. During the de facto government of Jes√∫s Jim√©nez Zamora that toppled Castro Madriz on November 1, 1868, anti-Masonic arguments were used to justify the defenestration, as for example, that was going to destroy the Cathedral and that would ban the catholic religion. Jim√©nez persecuted freemasonry and during its brief mandate its activities would be prohibited. But as a liberal he did not repelled many of Castro's reforms, for example, the educational reform was maintained and even included in the Constitution. Jim√©nez Zamora would be an ephemeral dictator, since he himself would be overthrown about a year after his coming to power and most of the coup leaders who took him from power were Masons. Tom√°s Guardia takes power and calls a Constituent Assembly that drafts the Constitution of 1871. Among its members were Masons Manuel Aragon, Aniceto Esquivel, Luis Diego S√°enz, Cipriano Mu√±oz, Andr√©s S√°enz, Alejandro Alvarado Garc√≠a (members of the Charity Lodge) and Bernardino Alvarado (Pacific Flower Lodge). In general, during the controversial authoritarian government of Guardia there would be countless political struggles between liberal and Masonic factions. Just as in Guatemala there would be different liberal and secular factions, some more militant and anti-clerical (led by the Mason, General Justo Rufino Barrios), and others more civil and democratic (like that of the Mason Lorenzo Mont√∫far exiled in Costa Rica). After the death of Guardia, his close associate Saturnino Lizano (also a Mason) took over for a couple of months. Pr√≥spero Fern√°ndez, a liberal soldier, of the Union Fraternal Lodge, obtains the presidency by electoral route and assumes it on August 10, 1882. With his government seems to end the bitter intra-Masonic struggles and gives a decided boost to the liberal and secular ideas and principles. He will continue his liberal work a young rebel student, and then his son-in-law, Bernardo Soto. The controversy over the liberal project is not long in coming, in front of the popular Germany-born Archbishop Monsignor Bernardo Augusto Thiel. From 1865 to 1870 of 31 deputies, 28 were Masons, 10 judges of the Supreme Court of Justice 9 belonged to Freemasonry, as well as 15 of 16 ministers and 6 presidents of the period were 5. The number of freemasons in public office is decreasing with time, for the parliamentary period from 1864 to 1866 only 4 of 22 deputies would be Freemasons (18%). Between 1864 and 1900 the number of Freemasons in the Parliament would range between 14% (1866-1868 and 1872-1874) to 34% (1884-1886). These percentages seem to disprove the accusations made by Catholic publications of the time such as Eco Cat√≥lico where they affirmed that 90% of the deputies were freemasons. Where they did have much more space was in the Executive Power, from 1865 to 1906 presidents Jos√© Mar√≠a Castro Madriz, Bruno Carranza, Tom√°s Guardia (although he would retire later), Jos√© Antonio Pinto Castro, Salvador Lara Zamora, Pr√≥spero Fern√°ndez Oreamuno, Bernardo Soto Alfaro and Ascensi√≥n Esquivel Ibarra were Freemasons. During their governments their cabinets would be made up of a number of freemasons that would range between 58% (Esquivel administration) to 86% (Guardia's). In any case, the situation would change from 1899 with the consecutive conservative governments of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Zeled√≥n (1890-1894) and his son-in-law Rafael Yglesias (1894-1902), under whose governments there seemed to be no influence of Freemasonry or important ministers belonging to it. During the historical period from 1865 to 1899, a series of republican and secularizing political reforms began in Costa Rica that promoted liberal ideas embraced by the social highclass of the time. Many of these liberal reforms that would shape the country were promoted by followers of Costa Rican Freemasonry. This would cause that for the 20th century Freemasonry would be homologated with liberalism and they would be seen as consubstantial with one another. On this would say the archbishop of San Jos√© Monsignor V√≠ctor Manuel Sanabria Mart√≠nez: However, during the nineteenth century relations between the Church and Masonry were always complex. The Costa Rican freemasons can not be identified as anticlerical, in fact there is evidence that Catholic and Protestant priests were part of it and had good relations with the liberal clergy. However, it came into conflict with the local Catholic hierarchy, led by Bishop Bernardo Augusto Thiel, who was an opponent of the liberal government, for which he was expelled from the country (along with the Jesuits) during the administration of Pr√≥spero Fern√°ndez and his newspaper Eco Cat√≥lico closed. The expulsion of Thiel caused in turn the temporary separation of Calvo from his position as priest, as Calvo was considered co- conspirator with the government and guilty for the introduction of Freemasonry in Costa Rica, although Calvo himself had been retired from masonic activities for that moment for nine years. Roberto Brenes Mes√©n, writer and poet, known Mason and Theosophist. After the death of Fernandez, his son-in-law, Bernardo Soto, nicknamed \\"Great Protector of the Masonic Order\\", came to power. Soto through the intercession of Calvo would allow the return of Thiel to the country who seemed to start making peace with Freemasonry. Naturally, under the government of Soto the freemasons would be part of his cabinet in large numbers. In 1889 arose the conservative Catholic and anti-Masonic Catholic Union Party, which began a fierce anti-Masonic campaign homologoating the organization with Satanism and describing it as an anti-Christian cult. Catholic newspapers of the time also sought to associate Freemasonry with other hostile currents of thought to the Church, thus Eco Catolico associated it with atheism and materialism, while the Catholic leadership linked it with Protestantism and affirmed that both had the same origin and the same goal; the destruction of the Church. As in other nations, the association of Freemasonry with Judaism could not be absent. According to Ricardo Martinez, in the official newspaper of the Catholic Union Party wrote: For the 1889 election, the first in which political parties took part, Freemasons Bernardo Soto and Ascensi√≥n Esquivel form the historical Liberal Progressive Party that faces the conservative Democratic Constitutional Party that postulates Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Zeled√≥n who has support from the Church. The progressive liberals are defeated in that process and the Constitutional Party, whose only function was to prevent the triumph of Esquivel, is dissolved. For the subsequent elections of 1894, Rodriguez had already broken his clerical ties and promoted the candidacy of his son-in-law Rafael Yglesias, who was facing the newly founded Catholic Union that nominated Jos√© Gregorio Trejos Guti√©rrez and faced all kinds of obstacles from the government, including the arrest of your candidate. By this time also the Independent Democratic Party of the freemason Felix Arcadio Montero Monge is founded. Yglesias and Esquivel founded the National Union Party for the 1902 election, which was dubbed by the Catholic Union as the \\"Masonic Party\\" despite the fact that Esquivel had already left Masonry by this time and there is no formal record that Yglesias ever was a Mason. Tom√°s Povedano, Spanish-born Costa Rican painter and Freemason. Costa Rican freemasonry would have an important weight in the founding of the Theosophical Society in Costa Rica in 1904. Several of its founders, such as the writer Roberto Brenes Mes√©n and the famous painter Tom√°s Povedano, were also Masters Masons. The Theosophical Society would play a very important influence in the Costa Rican culture in areas such as education, art and politics casually due to the membership of many of its members in important positions of government and the popularization of Theosophy among the Costa Rican aristocracy. This led her to have some cultural clashes with the Catholic Church, especially on certain topics such as artistic representations or complex controversies, such as when Brenes Mes√©n, director of the Liceo de Heredia, authorized the teaching of evolution and did not allow the teaching of the Catholic religion, two situations that generated angry polemics with the Church. Jos√© Basileo Acu√±a Zeled√≥n founded in 1919 the first Mixed Masonic Lodge (that is, that admits women and men) called Lodge Saint Germain No 621, originally belonging to Le Droit Humain based in Paris, France, 9 however, since 2002 Most mixed lodges adhere to the Eastern Order of International Co-Freemasonry based in Adhyar India. Lebanese and Syrian immigration would have an important role in Costa Rican Freemasonry. Many of these immigrants would join masonic lodges and two would become Grand Masters, the first the Lebanese businessman Bejos Yamuni Abdal√° who held the post of Venerable Master of the Grand Lodge between 1949 and 1950, and his son.10 Yamuni emigrated along with his parents and brothers arriving in the country in 1901 and prospering as merchants. His family was Maronite Christian and Yamuni, who acquired Costa Rican citizenship in 1912 married Costa Ricna-born of Syrian descent Mercedes Tabush in 1914. Yamuni entered the Freemasonry on July 5, 1905 in the Regeneration Lodge of San Jose, then moved to the Freedom Lodge of San Jos√© in 1910, the Hermes Lodge of the same place in 1927 and the Wonder Lodge of Alajuela in 1940 he would build his own Masonic Temple in 1943 under the aegis of Yamuni who was Venerable Master.10 All the previous lodges based on the Scottish Rite. In 1950 Yamuni inres√≥ to the Lodge The Light of Anglo-Saxon Protestants and English-speaking who used the York Rite.10 Both Bejos and his son were part of the Philosophical Chambers, being elected Grand Treasurer, Lieutenant and Grand Master. ==References== ","title":"Freemasonry in Costa Rica"},{"id":"60293612","text":"Karen Casella is a software engineer and advocate for inclusion in the technology industry.

He was first a Tory and later a Whig politician who sat in the Parliament of Ireland from 1692 to 1738, and in the English House of Commons and British House of Commons between 1705 and 1734. ==Early life== Medlycott was baptized on 22 May 1662, the third son of Thomas Medlycott of Abingdon, Berkshire. He was admitted at Middle Temple in 1680 and was called to the bar in 1687. He married by licence dated 1 January 1687, Sarah Goddard, daughter of Mrs Ursula Goddard, widow, of Mugwell (Monkwell) Street, Cripplegate, London. ==Career in Ireland== Medlycott began his career in Ireland as secretary and estate manager to James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. He was called to the Irish bar 1691 and appointed Attorney-general for the County palatine of Tipperary by 1692. In 1692 he was returned as Irish Member of Parliament for Kildare Borough and became Freeman of Drogheda on 1694. He was returned again for Kildare in 1695. In 1697, he was entrusted with a sensitive task of organizing opposition to a bill confirming the King's grant of James II's Irish estates. King William had overridden the former King's settlement of estates, worth about ¬£22,000, on his children and had given them to Elizabeth Villiers, allegedly William III's mistress, which had particularly upset Princess Anne. Medlycott obtained lands in Kilkenny, Tipperary and Waterford from the Duke of Ormonde in 1698 and 1699 and in 1701 purchased more land in Mayo from Ormond's brother, Lord Arran. In 1703 he was returned as Irish MP for Clonmell and in 1713 for Ballynakill. ==Career in Westminster== By 1705 Medlycott's brother James had increased his electoral influence at Milborne Port by acquiring additional burgages. At the 1705 English general election, Medlycott stood for the borough where his return was virtually guaranteed. During the election campaign the post of deputy-steward of Westminster became available and he immediately wrote to Ormond, the high steward, reminding him that he had previously promised him this office. The Duke kept his word and also obtained a commission in the Irish guards for Medlycott's son. Medlycott was returned in a contest as Member of Parliament for Milborne Port on his family's interest. In Parliament he voted with the Whigs and the moderate Tories on 25 October 1705 in favour of the Court candidate for Speaker, but in February 1706 he supported the Tories in a disputed election case. He was an assiduous member particularly with regard to Westminster matters. He was involved in three private bills, but his main concern was a bill for the prevention of fires. At the 1708 British general election he was returned as MP for Milborne Port and also for Westminster where he chose to sit once a petition against his return had been decided in his favour. He continued working hard, particularly with regard to urban matters. Measures he was involved in included tightening the provisions of his Fires Act, establishing a workhouse in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, extending the powers of London's commissioners of sewers, regulating hackney coaches, incorporating peruke-makers into the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, raising the militia and limiting long periods of public mourning because of the disastrous effects on the silk trade. He initiated a private estate bill on behalf of the Irish peer Viscount Gormanston and two other estate bills. In 1710, he followed the Tory line in voting against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. Medlycott was returned in a contest at the 1710 British general election and was listed as a ‚ÄòTory patriot‚Äô who voted for peace during the course of 1711, and as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who assisted in detecting the mismanagements of the former administration. He was also a member of the October Club.. He became a bencher of his Inn in 1712 and in July 1712 was appointed Commissioner of Revenue and Excise for Ireland by Robert Harley Lord Treasurer. He was returned unopposed at the 1713 British general election by which time he was described as a Tory who sometimes voted with the Whig. He spoke in favour of the motion condemning Richard Steele's* published attacks on the ministry on 18 March 1714, but was aligned with the Hanoverian Tories and spoke on the Court side in the debate on the succession and on 22 April in support of the address of thanks for the peace. He became Chairman of the Committee of elections and privileges in 1714. In July he petitioned Lord Oxford for repayment of the expenses he had incurred back in 1697 carrying out the Queen's commands with regard to her father's former Irish estates when she was princess. However, Anne's death a fortnight later pre-empted any chance of reimbursement. He retained his Irish post as Commissioner for Revenue and Excise after joining the Whigs. ==Later career== Medlycott did not stand at the 1715 British general election but was returned as Irish MP for Downpatrick. He remained in Ireland occupied with his official duties and his private affairs. He lost his Irish post in July 1727 but was returned as MP for Milborne Port at the 1727 British general election. He was also returned for the Parliament of Ireland seat at Newtown Limvady in 1727. He was reinstated as Commissioner for revenue and excise for Ireland in February 1728 and held it until October 1733 when his son-in-law was appointed his successor, on the ground that Medlycott was ‚Äòobliged to remain in England as a Member of Parliament‚Äô. In the House he voted with the Government for the excise bill and against the repeal of the Septennial Act. His only recorded speech was made on 21 February 1733 against the clause in a bill relating to the restrictive import of sugar, molasses and rum into Ireland. He was defeated at Milborne Port at the 1734 British general election by his nephew, Thomas Medlycott ==Death and legacy== Medlycott died before September 1738, leaving two sons and a daughter by his wife Sarah. However he left most of his estate in trust for Thomas John Medlycott, apparently an illegitimate son. ==References== Category:1662 births Category:1738 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1708‚Äì1710 Category:British MPs 1710‚Äì1713 Category:British MPs 1713‚Äì1715 Category:British MPs 1727‚Äì1734 ","title":"Thomas Medlycott (1662‚Äì1738)"},{"id":"60293682","text":"Jonathan Mark O'Brien (born 2 November 1961) is an English former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Career== In 1984, O'Brien signed for hometown club Southend United on non-contract terms, after playing for Maldon Town and Tilbury.

The fountain was dedicated in 1964 and a redesign was completed in 2009. ==History== Designed by Philip Johnson Associates, the fountain was dedicated on April 7, 1964. It was originally called the Lincoln Center fountain; its namesake is Charles Revson. The fountain was funded by the Revlon Foundation in 1962. Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the lead architects of the 2006 renovation of Lincoln Center, made several proposals to redesign the fountain, eventually changing the perimeter bench to a floating granite disk; the fountain itself was rebuilt by WET Design from 2007 to 2009. Andrew Dolkart objected to the redesign: \\"It‚Äôs the thing that upsets me most of all about what's happened at Lincoln Center. They thought that they needed to spend a lot of money ripping out Philip Johnson's fountain and putting in something new instead of restoring something that worked well.\\" The rebuilt fountain debuted on September 30, 2009, at a ceremony attended by members of Charles Revson's family. ==Design== Original fountain design; photographed by Suzanne Szasz for Documerica in August 1973. As originally designed, the fountain employed 568 jets and 88 lights with a combined illumination power of 26 kW. It was in diameter and was computer controlled, capable of shooting water in the air. J. S. Hamel of Hamel and Lancer was credited with engineering the fountain. The core of the fountain was an array of 40 jets arranged in a diameter circle around 16 lights capable of throwing water in the air; there were two larger concentric rings with smaller jets outside the core. The total combined flowrate of all the nozzles was . The water level of the fountain was originally elevated from the plaza level in the original design, which used a curb and bench around the perimeter of the retaining pool; during the redesign, the water level was lowered to the level of the plaza and the bench was reduced to a circular rim floating on slim supports. The redesigned fountain contains 353 jets arrayed in three concentric rings and 272 lights with a total illumination power of 27.2 kW. After the redesign, the fountain is capable of shooting water as high as in the air; 24 pumps move up to . ==In popular media== Revson Fountain has been featured in several notable films set in New York City, including: * The Producers (1967) * Sweet Charity (1969) * On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970) * Godspell (1973) * Manhattan (1979) * Ghostbusters (1984) * Moonstruck (1987) * Sweet Home Alabama (2002) In 2017, the water in Revson Fountain was dyed bright yellow during a prank. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1964 establishments in New York (state) Category:Fountains in New York City Category:Lincoln Center ","title":"Revson Fountain"},{"id":"60293748","text":"Valherbasse is a commune in the Dr√¥me department in southeastern France.

Marrero is also an attorney for Leopoldo L√≥pez; L√≥pez is Guaid√≥'s mentor and a political prisoner. * * * N√©stor Reverol, Interior Minister, said Marrero was part of a \\"terrorist cell\\" that was planning to attack government officials. Also available online with a subscription. On 28 March, a judge ruled that Marrero would remain in prison while evidence is gathered; the prosecutor has 45 days to present evidence. He was charged with \\"conspiracy, money laundering, association to commit a crime and concealment of weapons and explosives\\". During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the US had repeatedly warned Nicol√°s Maduro not to go after Guaid√≥; Haaretz reported that the arrest of Guaid√≥'s number-two person was a test of the US. ==Personal life== Roberto Eugenio Marrero Borjas founded the Human Rights Chair at Santa Maria University. He was a councilor for the Baruta Municipality. As of March 2019, he is 49 years old. == Political career == When Carlos Vecchio was prohibited from running in the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections, the Democratic Unity Roundtable (, MUD) solicited the National Electoral Council to accept Marrero as the candidate for Monagas state. Representing the Popular Will () political party, Marrero served as secretary in 2016 for the Venezuelan National Assembly. According to El Tiempo, Marrero has been working for \\"years behind the big names of the Venezuelan party Popular Will (VP), outlawed and fiercely persecuted by the regime of Nicol√°s Maduro.\\" A personal friend of the founder of the Popular Will party, political prisoner Leopoldo L√≥pez, Marrero was a member of the party's leadership. El Tiempo says he \\"is considered, by his party colleagues, as one of its main political operators, one of the channels of information closest to Lopez and appointed by him to be a right-hand man, caretaker and advisor to ... Juan Guaid√≥\\". == Arrest and detention == In the early morning of 21 March 2019, SEBIN officials first broke into the home of Marrero's neighbor, National Assembly deputy Sergio Vergara. Vergara tweeted that there were at least 40 SEBIN officials with long arms in 12 vehicles; The Wall Street Journal reports 15 SEBIN officials. They had Vergara on the floor, asking him where Marrero lived, a question he says he did not answer. Vergara reported that the agent's faces were covered; they held him for several hours although he informed them that he had parliamentary immunity. Vergara said he heard the officials breaking into Marrero's apartment next door. After about three hours between both apartments, the officials took Marrero and Vergara's driver, Luis Alberto P√°ez Salazar. Vergara says that as he was being taken away, Marrero shouted to him that the officials had planted a grenade and two rifles. Marrero was able to send an audio message before he was taken away, saying: Guaid√≥ said on 21 March that Marrero's whereabouts were not known. The Guardian says Marrero was taken to El Helicoide; Joel Garcia, Marrero's attorney, said that although he had not been able to see Marrero, he was certain that Marrero was at El Helicoide. El Tiempo said that, because of his closeness to both Guaid√≥ and L√≥pez, there was concern for Marrero's life; opposition politician Fernando Alb√°n Salazar died after being detained by SEBIN in what his party says was a result of torture, while officials labeled it a suicide. Opposition lawmakers were concerned he would be given psychotropic substances to induce false testimony. By noon on 22 March, there had been no contact with Marrero, and lawmakers who went to El Helicoide were denied access. In the evening of 22 March, attorneys were able to see Marrero and Paez when they were taken to court for a hearing; they both appeared well \\"psychically and physically\\". === Charges === Jorge Rodr√≠guez, Maduro's Communications Minister, alleged on state television that \\"Marrero was the ringleader of a plot to bring hitmen from Central America to Venezuela to carry out assassinations\\". Rodr√≠guez alleged that Leopoldo L√≥pez was the head of the \\"terrorist organization\\" that included Marrero, Vergara and Freddy Guevara, Carlos Vecchio, Freddy Superlano and two other unnamed persons. As evidence, he offered screen shots from Marrero's cell phone, which Rodr√≠guez claims show that Marrero was arranging payment for these hitmen. Maduro alleged that phone conversations about attempts to assassinate him had been recorded; the opposition denies these allegations. Several days later, attorney Juan Planchart M√°rquez, Guaid√≥'s cousin, was arrested and was being held at SEBIN headquarters; Rodr√≠guez claimed Planchart was the \\"financial operator\\" of the network that allegedly plotted to assassinate Maduro. On 28 March, a judge ruled that Marrero would remain in prison while evidence is gathered; the prosecutor has 45 days to present evidence. He was charged with \\"conspiracy, money laundering, association to commit a crime and concealment of weapons and explosives\\". Marrero's brother said Marrero would be held at El Helicoide. P√°ez was released on the condition that he is prohibited from leaving the country and must present regularly before the court. Planchart was also to remain in prison. ===Reactions=== Guaid√≥ called it a \\"vile and vulgar kidnapping\\", adding \\"Either Nicolas Maduro doesn't dare to arrest me, or he's not the one giving orders.\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, Guaid√≥ said he had received calls from security force officials disclaiming any involvement in the arrest; he replied that they need say no more, per the 2019 Venezuelan Amnesty Law; he said the \\"incident was indicative of divides within the Maduro regime\\". Hugo Carvajal, the head of Venezuela's military intelligence for ten years during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency and \\"one of the government's most prominent figures\\", Also available online. said that Maduro had two objectives with the \\"political kidnapping\\": 1) to \\"test the international threats against the dictatorship\\", and 2) to create a distraction to cover the recent revelations from Ronald Dugarte. Dugarte was formerly with Venezuela's military counterintelligence, and told the Organization of American States (OAS) that political prisoners ‚Äì both civilians and members of the armed forces ‚Äì are tortured, and that intelligence work is directed by Cubans in Venezuela. US special envoy for Venezuela Elliot Abrams said there will be consequences for the five individuals involved in Marrero's arrest. US Secretary of State Pompeo tweeted that the US \\"will hold accountable those involved\\". US Senator Marco Rubio said that Maduro's forces were testing the international response, \\"to calculate how & when to arrest Guaido\\". US national security advisor John Bolton stated that \\"Maduro has made another big mistake\\" that \\"will not go unanswered\\". The United States Department of State issued a statement in April 2019 highlighting Marrero's case as an example of the Maduro administration human rights abuses, alleging that \\"SEBIN has a record of using cruel and inhumane treatment to coerce confessions\\". Referencing After the arrest of several people around Guaid√≥, OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro described it as a \\"totalitarian attack\\" and called for \\"more forceful actions\\" from other countries. The Lima Group ‚Äì including Argentina, Brazil and Canada ‚Äì condemned the arrest. Paraguay's Chancellery tweeted that it condemned the illegal detention and demanded an end to human rights violations in Venezuela. Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, said the country would take concrete measures against Maduro's regime if Marrero is not released. Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez, Colombia's President, called the incident a \\"vile aggression\\" and said the international community should \\"condemn the criminal persecution of the dictatorship\\". Costa Rica and Peru also condemned the act. Canada's Chrystia Freeland said Marrero had been \\"illegally detained by the Maduro regime. Intimidation and fear will not stop the return of democracy to #Venezuela. Those responsible must be held accountable.\\" Michelle Bachelet, chief of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), called on Maduro to reveal Marrero's location. Venezuela's bishops condemned the arresst. The European Union called for the immediate and unconditional release of Marrero. France insisted that the repression against opposition members has to stop. Germany expressed repudiation for the arbitrary detention, saying it only intensified the conflict, and asked for guarantees of Marrero's safety. Reuters described the arrest and detention as part of \\"an escalating crackdown by President Nicolas Maduro against his opponents\\". USA Today described it as a kidnapping. The New York Times said the arrest resulted in a \\"significant escalation of the country‚Äôs political crisis\\". Also available online with subscription. Bloomberg said Maduro was pressuring Guaid√≥, and \\"testing the commitment of foreign governments to protecting him\\". Luis Salamanca, a Central University of Venezuela political scientist told The New York Times that Maduro was \\"raising the government's bargaining power in any future negotiations over the transfer of power ... but at the same time they are preparing escape routes if their ability to govern deteriorates further.‚Äù A risk consultant for London's IHS Markit, Diego Moya-Ocampos, said to Bloomberg that \\"the regime is testing the international community and its repeated warnings against laying a hand on Maduro's rival [Guaid√≥] ... if they can‚Äôt touch him, they'll go after those close to him.\\" Nicholas Watson of Teneo Intelligence told The Wall Street Journal that \\"Marrero's arrest looks like a desperate attempt to break Guaid√≥'s momentum .. The weakness in the regime's position is visible in the fact that arresting Guaid√≥ himself would be seen as a step too far.\\" Phil Gunson, analyst at the think tank International Crisis Group, said: ‚ÄúMaduro is essentially calling Trump‚Äôs bluff ... [he has] concluded that the military option is a very remote possibility. If he doesn‚Äôt see a meaningful response, he would be tempted to take the next step and jail Mr. Guaid√≥ himself.‚Äù An April survey of 1,000 voters by Hercon Consultores found that 71% of Venezuelans surveyed disagreed with Marrero's detention. === Banking sanctions === Just hours after Marrero's detention, the United States Department of the Treasury responded on 22 March 2019 by placing sanctions on BANDES, the Venezuelan Economic and Social Development Bank () and four of its subsidiaries, that are based in Venezuela, Uruguay and Bolivia. The sanctioned subsidiaries are Banco Bandes Uruguay, Banco Bicentenario del Pueblos, Banco Universal SA Banco de Venezuela, and Banco Prodem SA, of Bolivia. The sanctions mean that \\"all property and interests in property of these entities, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by this entity, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked\\" and they \\"prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.\\" US National Security Advisor John Bolton tweeted, \\"BANDES bank is to Venezuela's financial sector what PDVSA is to its oil sector. This action will severely affect any attempted currency movements by Maduro and his cronies moving forward.\\" Bolton told Univision the sanctions were a direct response to Marrero's arrest, and that \\"Our aim is to bring this crisis to a conclusion quickly for the benefit of the Venezuelan people to get the Maduro regime to peacefully transiton to the Guaido regime so that we can have free and fair elections.\\" Univision said this action \\"put 'the entire banking sector' on notice\\" that \\"persons operating in Venezuela's financial sector may be subject to sanctions.\\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, \\"The willingness of Maduro's inner-circle to exploit Venezuela‚Äôs institutions knows no bounds. Regime insiders have transformed BANDES and its subsidiaries into vehicles to move funds abroad in an attempt to prop up Maduro. Maduro and his enablers have distorted the original purpose of the bank, which was founded to help the economic and social well-being of the Venezuelan people, as part of a desperate attempt to hold onto power.\\" Mnuchin warned, \\"The regime's continued use of kidnapping, torture, and murder of Venezuelan citizens will not be tolerated by the U.S. or the international coalition that is united behind President Guaido. Roberto Marrero and other political prisoners must be released immediately.\\" == See also == * Detention of Juan Requesens * Detention of Maria Lourdes Afiuni ==Notes== ==ReferencesRoberto Marrero archive at La Patilla * Tal Cual Digital Judges Category:Living people Category:Popular Will politicians Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:2019 in politics Category:March 2019 events in South America Category:Venezuelan prisoners and detainees Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Prisoners and detainees of Venezuela Category:Venezuelan lawyers Category:Venezuelan presidential crisis ","title":"Roberto Marrero"},{"id":"60293841","text":"1920 photo by Nelson Evans Darrell Foss (1892-1962) was a film actor.

After attending Winchester College and the University of Oxford, Stanley-Clarke enlisted with the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in August 1909. In a military career which lasted until 1944, he fought in both the First World War and the Second World War. He was highly decorated, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order, Legion d'Honneur, Croix de Guerre and the Order of Polonia Restituta. He also played first-class cricket for the British Army cricket team. ==Early life and military career== Stanley-Clarke was born at Brighton and educated at Winchester College, before going up to the University of Oxford. He was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant on the unattached list in June 1906, before joining the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in August 1909. He made appearance in minor counties cricket for Dorset in the 1909 Minor Counties Championship. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in June 1910. Stanley-Clarke served during the First World War, in the early stages of which he was promoted to the rank of captain in November 1914. He was wounded in action while in the trenches near Chamigny on the Western Front. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major in March 1916, while in December of the same year he was made an acting lieutenant colonel while commanding a battalion. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours, for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when leading a counter-attack. When he left his battalion in 1918, he was awarded the Legion d'Honneur and the Croix de Guerre by France. ==Inter-war military career== He was seconded in February 1922 to serve as an officer in charge of a contingent of gentlemen cadets at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

He served as Rabbi in Wagstadt (Austrian Silesia) and in Leitmeritz. In 1905 he was appointed Second Rabbi in Copenhagen, and in 1910 he got the position of Chief Rabbi of that community. Unlike his predecessor, Schornstein was easier on the conversion to Judaism of women who wished to marry Jewish men. Schornstein kept the Copenhagen position throughout World War I, till 1919, after which he was forced to quit the job due to disagreements with the community leaders who refused aid to the multiple Jewish immigrants that came to Denmark from Russia in those days. He moved to Dresden, and there, too, was active in attempts to bring the local Jews and the eastern Jews closer together. === Immigration to the Land of Israel === In 1935, Schornstein immigrated to the Land of Israel, and, at the age of 65, opened a pet shop named \\"Gan Hayot\\" (\\"zoo\\" in Hebrew) in Tel Aviv. A year later, in 1936, he was invited to the Levant Fair, where the exhibition of animals in cages he displayed was visited by some 15,000 people. After the fair, he reopened the zoo on HaYarkon Street, and added large birds to the collection. Over the next years, several donations made the zoo a municipal attraction: a pair of lions from Egypt, plus a pair of leopards and a pair of Asian black bears from India. To better accommodate the larger number of animals, Schornstein submitted to the Tel Aviv municipality, with the aid of an \\"animal lovers society\\" and backed by a petition signed by 1139 residents of the city, a request to lease a land plot for building a larger zoo. In June 1938 the municipality acceded to the request, and allocated a two and a half dunam on the Portalis grove site ‚Äì nowadays next to the current location of the municipality building, but in that time, a hill so distant from the city, that he requested to be allowed to advertise the location of the zoo, for free, on municipal billboards and buses. On November 25, 1938, Schornstein handed over ownership of all the animals owned by him to the Zoo Society, in exchange for their transfer to the new location, and provisioning for them. Schornstein himself was promised the position of the zoo director. The zoo was indeed opened as planned; however, following disagreements between Schornstein and the Society, he demanded to nullify the agreement. At the end of 1939, the dispute was passed to arbitration, and the Society ceased paying Schornstein's salary. For a while, Schornstein earned a living by selling pets, but in August 1940 the Tel Aviv municipality forbade him to continue that activity, leaving him with no source of income. On August 27, 1940, Schornstein marched into the zoo offices, and took three Palestine pounds from the desk, right in front of the accountant, claiming that it was on account for his held back wages. The accountant reported this to the Society manager, and a complaint was filed against him at the police. Schornstein was charged with theft on September 25, 1940, and judge Shneor Cheshin ruled that he should have received the money from the Society, but should not have taken the money in the way he did. Schorenstein was convicted and charged with bail of five pounds for half a year to guarantee that he would not repeat the offense. In November 1940 the arbitrators published their decision, in which the majority ruled that Schornstein had breached the agreement, and thus the animals shall remain under ownership of the Society, who would pay Schornstein 300 pounds and his salary as zoo director until November 1940. In June 1941 the legal dispute came to a conclusion with an agreement signed in the Tel Aviv District Court: Schornstein committed not to sell animals or birds from the zoo, and in exchange was provided with a monthly retainer, and he and his family were granted lifetime free entrance to the zoo. In addition, the Society committed to commemorate Schornstein on a plaque at the zoo gate, if he fulfilled his commitment. === Last days === Schornstein moved to Beit HaKerem, Jerusalem and founded the \\"Bird Garden\\". In 1947 he moved to Netanya, where the local municipality gave him a plot of half a dunam for a petting zoo. In 1949 Schornstein fell ill and moved to live with his son at one of the moshavot in the Sharon. He died at the end of October, 1949, at the age of 80. The Tel Aviv Zoo was closed in 1980, its animals were moved to the Ramat Gan Safari, and the Gan Ha'ir shopping mall and residential tower were built on its site. A bronze sculpture of Schornstein, created in 1945 by the artist K√§the Ephraim-Marcus, was placed on the Gan Ha'ir site, as a donation by her children Ephraim and Carmela Marcus. Schornstein's daughter, Meta, married Marcus Melchior, who was later also appointed to Chief Rabbi of Copenhagen, and then also to Chief Rabbi of the whole Jewish community of Denmark, as was his son, Bent Melchior. Bent's son, the great grandson of Schornstein, is Michael Melchior, former Minister of Social and Diaspora Affairs, a former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and a former member of the Knesset for Meimad. == References == Category:1869 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People from Tachov Category:People from Copenhagen Category:People from Tel Aviv Category:Danish rabbis Category:Danish emigrants to Israel Category:Czech rabbis Category:Czech emigrants to Denmark Category:Zoo directors Category:Zoos in Israel ","title":"Mordecai Schornstein"},{"id":"60293967","text":"Mitrephora macclurei is a species of plant in the family Annonaceae.

The visuals of the characters were designed by Minami Seira and their stories were created by Aneko Yusagi. ==Main characters== ; : :The Shield Hero. He was a university student who was summoned from another world after finding a book about the Four Heroes. Originally an open minded person, he becomes cynical and distrustful of others due to being looked down by his fellow heroes, subjected to religious prejudice from citizens, and being robbed and falsely accused of rape by Malty. It is only after Raphtalia defended him and proclaimed her loyalty that Naofumi began to slowly open up to those around him and realizing his mistakes. Viewing his role as a Hero burdensome, having been summoned against his will, Naofumi shows little remorse in using underhanded tactics to ensure the survival of his party despite the criticism of his fellow heroes. Generally reluctant to trust strangers, often asking to be paid upfront or using slave curses to prevent lying, he tries his best to live up to the expectations of those who have placed their faith in him or treat him as an equal. :After defeating Kyo and ending the threat of the Spirit Tortoise (the Cal Mira Wave in the Anime), Naofumi is given control of Raphtalia's hometown. He soon plans to rebuild and make a makeshift army to fight against the Waves and remaining Guardian Beasts, purchasing the original displaced inhabitants and other slaves to repopulate. He often enjoys pretending to be the villain, much to Raphtalia's annoyance and the reluctance of his allies, and working as a merchant/craftsman in his spare time. Believing he'll one day return home, he considers himself a foster parent to Raphtalia and Filo and desires to make sure they can protect themselves in his absence. :Although Naofumi has a slow start because of the public's perception of him and being unable to attack enemies directly, he is still able to keep up with his fellow heroes and even outshine them due to unlocking a wide variety of shields that boost his allies and passive skills. Given his high defenses, he is able to shrug off most attacks and displays immunity to most poisons, being only vulnerable to attacks that use his stats against him such as Hengen Muso. His strongest shield: the cursed Shield of Wrath, allows him to counterattack opponents with black flames that rise with his anger at the cost of temporarily decreasing his stats and threatening to allow his inner darkness to take control. While the Legendary Shield is temporarily disabled in Kizuna's world, he is chosen as the new Vassel Mirror Hero. ; : : The Vassal Katana Hero and Tanuki Demi- human. Originally living in a village on Melromarc's coast, Raphatalia was left orphaned in the wake of the first Wave to strike the world. Shortly after, she and her fellow villagers were captured and sold into slavery by Melromarc's Royal Knights. First purchased by a nobleman, she is physically and emotionally tortured out of racial resentment towards Demi-humans and left a shell of her former self. Near death and suffering from panic attacks, she was sold back and later purchased by Naofumi who, unable to fight himself and spite towards Malty, desired to use her as his sword in the coming Waves. :Under Naofumi's protection, Raphtalia becomes a skilled swordfighter and is able to find closure from her past traumas. Able to see past Naofumi's cynical nature, she falls in love with him and does her best to help him overcome his resentment towards others and losing himself to the Shield of Wrath, even volunteering to have her slave curse re-applied after it is forcibly removed as a sign of devotion. It is later revealed that through her Tanuki herritage, she is an heir to the throne of Q'Ten Lo, her father having eloped to Meloromarc and putting her at odds with her distant relatives. :Technically a 10 year old girl, being a Demi-human, Raphtalia's body is able to age to that of a young woman as her levels increase. Due to this, she often gets annoyed when Naofumi treats her as his daughter or is oblivious to her feelings; the latter believing she is only focused on getting stronger. While traveling in Kizuna's world, she is chosen as the wielder of the Vassal Katana (Sever Star Hammer in the Web Novel). She also specializes in Light/Dark magic and is able to turn herself and allies invisible or generate illusions. : Raphtalia was selected as the Best Girl in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in 2020.https://www.crunchyroll.com/animeawards/en/vote/index.html ; : :A Filolial Queen. Hatching her from an egg purchased from the Slave Trader, Filo is the youngest of Naofumi's allies. She is part of a monster species called Filolials that enjoy pulling carts, and having been raised by a Hero, develops into a Queen. As a Queen, she resembles a large flightless owl and possesses higher attack strength and speed than normal members of her species. In addition, she possesses the unique ability to shapeshift into a young blonde girl with wings, retaining the strength of her true form. :Young and boisterous, she has a short attention span, has a ravenous appetite, and often fights Raphtalia and Gaelion for Naofumi's attention, much to his and others annoyance. Also highly impressionable, she has been shown to pick up on some of Naofumi's habits much to Raphtalia's distress. A capable learner, she is able to use advanced wind magic spells and many of the teachings of Hengen Muso with minimal instruction. Her skills are recognized by her Queen predecessor, Fitoria, and is given some of her power. :In spite of her sometimes overbearing personality, Filo is able to quickly make friends with others and takes other Filolials on as her underlings. True to her Filolial instincts, her favorite hobby is to pull a custom cart Naofumi made for her. While in Kizuna's world, due to Filolial's not existing, she is transformed into a species called a Humming Fairy, losing her strength in favor of being able to fly and cast magic through singing. ==Summoned heroes== ===Legendary Heroes=== ; : :The Spear Hero. Motoyasu was a university student before he was summoned, having been stabbed to death after a misunderstanding by childhood friend and a classmate. While generally a kindhearted person, he is immensely gullible and thick-headed; showing near complete unawareness of the actions of his manipulative party members or the foresight to plan ahead. A heavy womanizer, he is looked down upon by his fellow heroes for his skirt chasing habits, and is extremely trusting of women to his own detriment. He also displays a Lolita Complex towards Filo, as she resembles a video game character in his home-world. :Initially the leader of a party composed entirely of women who act as his cheerleaders and, unaware of her true nature, Motoyasu sympathizes with Malty's claims against Naofumi and invites her to join him; initially leading Naofumi to believe the two were working together. Despite warnings from his fellow Heroes and Melromarc's Queen, he believes Malty‚Äôs claims of Naofumi brainwashing others and clashes with him repeatedly, even after Malty‚Äôs true nature is exposed. Later, he is abandoned by his party and left for dead during the battle with the Spirit Turtle, leaving him critically depressed. Comforted by Filo, he chooses to re-dedicate his efforts to winning her heart and seeks approval from Naofumi to marry her; leading many to question his mental stability and causing Filo distress with his unwanted advances. :Motoyasu is shown to be physically the strongest of the Heroes. He unlocks the cursed Spears of Lust and Envy after Malty‚Äôs betrayal, and as a result of their cursed aftereffects: literally seeing/hearing women as squealing pigs, his mental state deteriorates even further. The only Legendary Hero unaware of the effects of cursed weapons, he creates a party composed of Filolials; having fallen madly in love with the species as a whole. :The title protagonist of The Reprise of the Spear Hero, Motoyasu, upon being killed in battle, unlocks the ability to time travel and returns to the start of the series with his stats and memories of Filo intact. Proclaiming himself: \\"The Love Hunter,\\" he dedicates himself again to trying to win Filo's heart and protecting Naofumi from the events that turned him cynical; generally with mixed results. ; : :The Sword Hero. The youngest of the Heroes, Ren was a high school student before he was summoned after being killed trying to save a childhood friend. A loner by nature, he does his best to keep his image as a cool guy intact; at one point resorting to cheating when in a losing duel against Eclair. Commanding the most loyalty, he prefers to run his party like a guild and only working directly together when a powerful monster appears believing each member is only responsible for themselves. While the most willing of the Heroes to hear out Naofumi's claims and advice, his condescending nature towards those at lower levels than himself still leads to tension between the two. To the amusement of his fellow heroes, he has a fear of water and is unable to swim. :After his entire party is killed by the Spirit Tortoise, he falls into a state of denial and grief. Despite Naofumi's initial attempts to help him, he instead turns to Malty for emotional support and is soon robbed of his belongings. Donning a disguise, he resorts to stealing to get by and becomes the leader of a group of bandits; unlocking the cursed Swords of Greed and Gluttony in the process. :In his cursed state, he is re-challenged by Eclair and is easily defeated. Finally willing to accept responsibility for his past mistakes and unable to gain experience or money as a result of using his cursed weapons, he chooses to stay in Naofumi's village and become Eclair's student. ; : : The Bow Hero. Itsuki was a high school student before he was summoned, having been killed after a large truck took a sudden left turn. Calling himself an ally of Justice, he holds a superiority complex and has an innate need for attention, often bragging about his exploits to others. He chooses to run his party in a vigilante-like fashion, primarily taking on missions that involve corrupt officials and assisting others at the most opportune moments. He runs his party within a strict hierarchy of seniority, treating new party members as servants. Due to his self-indulgent attitude and treatment of his party members, Naofumi comes to dislike him the most of his fellow Heroes. Itsuki's feud with Naofumi comes to a head after he frames Rishia for a crime as a thinly veiled excuse to kick her out of his party; viewing her as weak and for upstaging him during the Wave in Cal Mira. :His remaining party later betrays him during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise by tying him up and leaving him for dead. In a state of denial, he is soon tricked by Malty into fighting on her behalf in tournaments in Zeltoble; believing he was raising money to help her stop Naofumi from abusing his slaves and extorting citizens for money. Unlocking the cursed Bow of Pride, he fights against Rishia and is defeated as Naofumi and Ren expose the truth. Left in debt by Malty and having lost his volition as a result of his cursed weapon, he begs Rishia for forgiveness and chooses to stay in Naofumi's village as he recovers. : Coming from a world where humans have recently developed psychic powers, Itsuki was born with the precision ability called 'Accuracy.' Initially over-confident at a young age, as he grew older and learned that his ability was classified as low-ranking, he turned to games as an escape. While traveling in the parallel world, Itsuki reveals his talent at playing music and leading him to obtain possession of the Vassal Musical Instrument; temporarily replacing his disabled Legendary Bow. ; :The Hunting Hero. One of the four Legendary Heroes of the parallel world, Kizuna was playing virtual reality game when she was summoned. Unlike the other Heroes called upon to fight the Waves, she was summoned prior to their appearance and was tasked with defeating a corrupt Dragon Emperor. A strong-willed woman, she has an easy time making friends and enjoys traveling the world. An avid fisherman, her party members sometimes have to restrain her to help keep her focus on tasks at hand. Despite her looks, she is eighteen years old and takes pride in being an otaku. She lives in a home she built herself alongside Glass; later inspiring Naofumi to found his own village. :After her party defeated the Demon Dragon, she found herself in a hostile country and was cast into a magic labyrinth. By the time she meets Naofumi and Rishia, having been cast themselves into the labyrinth by Kyo, several years had passed. With Naofumi's assistance, they are able to escape and work together to find their displaced party members. Initially unaware of the threat of the Waves, she orders her party to cease their attacks on Naofumi's world. She and her party join Naofumi in defeating Kyo and vow to work together to solve the mystery of the Waves and save their worlds without resorting to killing their opposing Legendary Heroes. :Her Legendary Weapon can turn into a large hunting knife or fishing rod. Not unlike Naofumi, she is restricted in her attacking capabilities in that she can only attack monsters. Kizuna does not appear in the original web novel, although Glass, near the end of the story, mentions a close friend gone missing, probably referring to Kizuna. ===Seven Star and Vassal Heroes=== ; : :The Seven Star Projectile Hero. The daughter of a lesser noble family, she was originally kidnapped by a corrupt nobleman and was saved by Itsuki. Having fallen in love with him and admiring his sense of justice, Rishia joined Itsuki's party. Itsuki, however, seeing her as a burden, tries to drive her away by treating her as more of a servant than a teammate. After inadvertently upstaging him during the Cal Mira Wave, Itsuki resorts to framing her for breaking an important item and kicks her out. Left emotionally frail, Rishia attempts to commit suicide but is rescued by Naofumi and Filo. Sensing a kindred spirit in her and wanting to prove Itsuki wrong, Naofumi takes her into his party, hoping to train her into a capable fighter. :Upon meeting the Hengen Muso Master, she is selected to be her apprentice and undergoes heavy training to be able to utilize chi. Later, when Itsuki is corrupted by his cursed weapon, she challenges him to duel with the intent of teaching him the difference between justice and self- righteousness. For her courage, the Legendary Bow chooses her to wield the Seven Star Projectile (Knives/Boomerangs/Throwing Stars); its true power is only unlocked upon its liberation from Takt later on. After defeating Itsuki, she re-joins his party and works to help him recover from his curse. :A shy young girl with poor stamina, Rishia has lack of confidence in herself but learns to open up after joining Naofumi's party. Despite being at a high level, her stats are notably weak and have poor growths. It is only in times of crisis does her hidden power shine through, allowing her to take on powerful opponents such as Kyo single-handedly. She also displays a remarkable learning ability and is a budding scholar; leading Naofumi to believe that there are hidden stats she specializes in. ; : :The King Consort of Melromarc and the Seven Star Staff Hero. His real name: L√ºge Lansarz Faubrey, Aultcray was formerly an heir to the throne of Faubrey. After his parents are killed by the Hakuko of Siltvelt and losing his right to the throne as a result, he and his blind younger sister changed their names and moved to Melromarc. Shortly after, he joined Melromarc's army and rose through the ranks, becoming the Staff Hero, winning an on-going war with Siltvelt, and marrying Mirellia. His hatred of demi-humans is intensified after his sister is murdered by the Hakuko (not realizing she was in love with Siltvelt's Hakuko Prince), and leading him to follow the Church of the Three Heroes. :Taking charge of the Melromarc while his wife is away on diplomatic business, Aultcray turned a blind eye to Melromarc's knights when they enslaved Raphtalia's village, and at the behest of the Church, has all four of the Legendary Heroes summoned. Initially tolerant of Naofumi being the Shield Hero, he stages a kangaroo court after his daughter Malty accuses Naofumi of rape and puts in place obstacles to make his life more difficult. Having broken several treaties and degrading the status of the Shield Hero, he is later placed under arrest by his wife in an attempt to prevent war from breaking out. He is stripped of his nobility and, in lieu of Naofumi's push for the death penalty, has his named legally changed to: \\"Trash.\\" : Still firm in his beliefs that the Shield Hero will bring nothing but ruin to Melromarc, Aultcray initially remained defiant of Mirellia's attempts to make amends with Naofumi. Falling into a deep depression upon the deaths of both his wife & his niece Atla, Aultcray is convinced to by Naofumi to live up to Mirellia's final request, reassuming his role as protector of Melromarc as the Staff Hero; choosing to remain being called \\"Trash\\" in recognition of his past mistakes. ; :The Seven Star Gauntlet Hero and a White Tiger Demi-human. The late grandson of the former king of Siltvelt, he travels to Zeltoble and sells himself into slavery after the funds left by his deceased parents run out; fighting in coliseums to pay for medicine for his younger sister. He and Atla are later purchased by Naofumi and brought to his village. Grateful to Naofumi for curing his sister's disease, Fohl vows to pull his fair share of work to pay him back by fighting in the Waves. :A member of the Hakuko, a rare and powerful species of Demi- humans, Fohl is both proud, stubborn, and a natural martial artist. Deeply overprotective of his younger sister, he often clashes with Atla's adamant personality and leaving him on the receiving end of her attacks; causing Naofumi to wonder who is stronger between two. Despite being only half demi- human, he obtains the ability transform into a Therianthrope and later, with Naofumi's help, gains the ability to use the even stronger: Beast Transformation. Vowing to continue fighting to honor his late sister's final wishes, Fohl is chosen to wield the Seven Star Gauntlet. ; : :The Vassal Fan Hero. A martial artist chosen to wield the Vassal Fan, she joined Kizuna's party and became her closest ally. Cold and stern, she has a high sense of honor and only opens up to Kizuna; whom she considers her best friend. After Kizuna's disappearance, as an act of desperation, Glass and Kizuna's remaining allies decide to invade Naofumi's world upon learning their world may be spared from the Waves should the opposing world's Legendary Heroes perish. :Glass first appears before the Legendary Heroes during the third Wave and challenges Naofumi to a duel, recognizing him as the only true hero among them. Overwhelmed by her power, Naofumi's party narrowly survives. She appears again before Naofumi during the Cal Mira Wave to aid her allies in killing him, but are forced to retreat after Naofumi discovers her weakness. Ordered by her weapon to kill Kyo after he goes rogue, she forms an alliance with Naofumi to defeat him; eventually reuniting with Kizuna in the process. Initially looking down upon Naofumi, she comes to respect him and is grateful for his help in rescuing Kizuna. As a sign of friendship, Naofumi leaves her with a recipe for Soul-Healing Water, to help her cover her weakness in future battles. :A member of a race known as Spirit People, at any given time her level and stats are tied directly to her Soul Power. As such, Glass is vulnerable to attacks that can drain this stat. Using her fans, she fights using a graceful form of martial arts. At the peak of her power, she is able to hold her own in battle against the Legendary Heroes and defeat boss monsters in a single blow. ; : :The Vassal Scythe Hero. The young king of a country that revers the Hunting Hero, he is chosen to wield the Vassal Scythe and joins Kizuna's Party upon her summoning. A relaxed person, he enjoys traveling and fighting despite his duties as king. He and his companion, Therese, secretly travel to Naofumi's world, hoping to find and defeat the Legendary Heroes to save his own world. :L'Arc unwittingly befriends Naofumi when they travel to the Cal Mira islands to train, offering to team up during their stay. Hearing rumors that the Shield Hero is a criminal, he insists that Naofumi could not be the Legendary Hero, believing him to be a good person and calling him \\"kiddo\\" instead. It is only during the Cal Mira Wave does he come to realize who Naofumi is and challenges him, but is forced to retreat. He later returns and allies with Naofumi in order to defeat Kyo; renouncing his goal of killing the Legendary Heroes upon Kizuna's orders. L'Arc does not appear in the web novel. ; :The Vassal Book Hero. The leader of the Libary Rabbit species, a race of scholars that inhabit the parallel world. Like the filolial species, he has the ability to take the form of a young boy. Introduced to Naofumi by Kizuna, he uses his knowledge in the creation of Shikigami/Familiars to help in the search for their missing friends and later joins in the battle against Kyo. A reserved individual, due to his species not being suited for combat, he generally leaves himself to playing a supportive role in battle. :Initially introduced as the Vassal Boat Hero, giving himself the ability to fly and transport allies, it is subsequently stolen by Vanguards of the Wave. During the battle against Hidemasa, Ethnobalt is chosen to be the new Vassal Book Hero giving him the ability to take offensive action in battle. While in Naofumi's world, due to Libary Rabbits not existing, he takes the form of a Usapil monster. ; :The Sewing Set Hero. The sole survivor of a world that had been destroyed after its Legendary Heroes were killed, she was initially in Naofumi's world in an attempt to kill his world's Legendary Heroes. Left without purpose, she disguises herself and joins the Zeltoble coliseum circuit, quickly rising to become the top fighter. She meets Naofumi's Party in the finals of a tournament and is narrowly defeated. Afterwards, she re-appears in Naofumi's village, hoping to join his party in fighting against the Vanguards of the Waves and offering proceeds from her coliseum matches. :S'yne's primary weapon is a pair of scissors and can bind opponents using threads. She can create stuffed animal familiars, to fight and speak on her behalf, and also special sewing pins that allow her teleport to their location. Quiet and often emotionless, S'yne comes to hold a deep respect for Naofumi; placing her pins on his armor so she can keep track of him at all times. Due to the destruction of her home world, the translation feature of her weapon is broken, leaving her speech partially static. S'yne does not appear in the web novel. ==Antagonists== ; : : The former first Princess of Melromarc and primary antagonist of the series. Using \\"Myne Sophia\\" as her adventurer name, Malty was the first and only person to join Naofumi in the beginning, but shortly after, she stole his money and equipment, and then claimed he raped her. She joins Motoyasu's party, believing his good looks will be able to help her standing within Melromarc's nobility. While in Motoyasu's party she acts as his second-in-command, taking advantage of his gullibility and manipulating him into doing her dirty work or making Naofumi's life more miserable. Despite Motoyasu's kindness, she insults him behind his back and sells her fellow party members into sexual slavery should they get in her way. :After the defeat of the Church of the Three Heroes, whose members she worked with in an attempt to assassinate her sister Melty and frame Naofumi, Malty's true nature is exposed by her mother. Disowned from the royal family, Malty is placed under a special slave curse and is forced to reveal the rest of her crimes. In lieu of Naofumi's push for the death penalty, her name is legally changed to \\"Bitch.\\" She stays in Motoyasu's party so she can repay her debts; Motoyasu still believing her lies. She and her followers, however, abandon Motoyasu during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise. Now a wanted criminal, she goes on the run, manipulating and robbing Ren and Itsuki in the process. :Traveling to Faubery, Malty briefly joins Takt's harem of women and works with him to steal the Legendary Weapons and killing her family in exchange for removing her slave curse. Thereafter she reveals herself as a member of the Vanguard of the Waves, assisting them in stealing the Legendary & Vassal Weapons of Kizuna's world. :Specializing in fire magic, Malty is sadistic, power hungry, and manipulative. She uses her looks and status to control others, often appealing to their egos or taking advantage of their naivety. Believing her unfit to rule, prior to the start of the series, Mirellia placed her second-in-line to the throne after her younger sister. ; : Nicknamed \\"Armor\\" by Naofumi due to never being seen without wearing a heavy suit of armor and general lack of interest in remembering his name, Mald is a former member of Itsuki's party. Having joined Itsuki's party to boost his own sense of superiority, he as a stuck up attitude and looks down upon Naofumi and all demi-humans. Deluded and self righteous, he views anyone who disagrees with him as evil. : Annoyed with Naofumi's success and Itsuki's lack of success, Mald joins his fellow party members in abandoning Itsuki during the battle against the Spirit Tortoise by tying him up and leaving him for dead. Joining Malty and her allies as they escape Melromarc, he assists her in tricking Itsuki into fighting in the Zeltoble's coliseum. : Alongside Malty, Mald reappears before Naofumi and Itsuki as a member of the Vanguard of the Waves. Having stolen the power of the Seven Star Axe, he assists them in stealing Legendary & Vassal Weapons. ; Church of the Three Heroes :The primary religion of Melromarc who view the Shield Hero as a demon. Originally a part of the Church of the Four Heroes, which worshiped the Legendary Heroes equally, the Church broke off due to racial resentment when a former Shield Hero assisted in the founding of Demi- Human nations such as Siltvelt. Helping found Melromarc in opposition, the Church holds sway among Melromarc's citizens and guards the country's Dragon Vein Hourglass; a tool used to Class Up, predict the Waves, and can be used as warp points by Legendary Heroes. :After Queen Mirellia, who doesn't subscribe to their beliefs, left on a diplomatic tour of the world, the Church used sway with King Aultcray to prematurely summon the Legendary Heroes; hoping to manipulate Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki to gain more power while making Naofumi's life more difficult. Yet despite their efforts, Naofumi's heroics and the general incompetence of the remaining Three Heroes causes them to start losing influence among the populace. Taking drastic measures, they attempt to frame Naofumi for assassinating, later kidnapping, Princess Melty. Coming to the conclusion that Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki are fake Heroes and proclaiming himself to be a God, the High Priest (\\"Bicas T. Balmus\\" in the anime) leads his followers in an attempt to eliminate all four of the Legendary Heroes and overthrow the royal family. With assistance from a returning Mirellia, Naofumi kills the High Priest with the Shield of Wrath as his followers are arrested. In the aftermath, Mirellia uses the political opportunity to proclaim the Church as heretical and outlaw them. ; : The former Vassal Book Hero. Chosen by his country to wield the Vassal Book, Kyo became a traveling scientist studying the Waves hoping to wield their power for himself. His research leads him to secretly travel to Naofumi's world and prematurely awaken the Guardian Beast known as the Spirit Tortoise. :Taking control of her body, Kyo uses the Spirit Tortoise's power to absorb energy from deceased souls and leads it in a murderous rampage across several kingdoms. Defeating the parties of Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki, Kyo imprisons them to steal even more power from their Legendary Weapons. With help from Ost, Naofumi's party and Fitoria succeed in destroying the Spirit Tortoise, forcing him to flee back to his parallel world with the remaining energy he had collected. :Using the Spirit Tortoise's collected energy, Kyo binds his Vassal weapon after it attempts to rebel. Continuing his research, he secretly abducts many adventures, including the Vassal Mirror Hero, and conducts live-human experiments. Creating an army of familiars, copies of his world's Guardian Beasts, and homunculus monsters, he attempts to take over his world. Storming his laboratory, Naofumi's party succeeds in defeating him with the Shield of Wrath and Spirit Tortoise Shield. His soul survives and attempts to possess a homuculus copy of his body, but is devoured by a nearby Soul Eater monster. The Vassal Book and Mirror, free of his control, disappear to find new wielders. ; Demon Dragon Emperor : A Dragon Emperor from the parallel world, who prior to the start of the series, attempted to conquer humanity. Defeated by the Hunting Hero Kizuna and her allies, his remains are taken and used to forge new weapons. In preparation against Kyo, Naofumi is gifted with part of his dragon core, unwittingly merging it Dragon Emperor Gaelion's core to power up his shield. Now inside the Legendary Shield, the Demon Dragon chooses to bide his time and secretly assists Naofumi in his battle against Kyo. :He makes his presence fully known after Gaelion is possessed by Dragon Emperor Gaelion by hijacking the connection between them and Naofumi and Filo; who had previously powered themselves up using dragon cores. Absorbing power from his victims, he uses Naofumi as medium and takes his strength from the Shield of Wrath; becoming an embodiment of Naofumi's inner darkness called the Wrath Dragon. He is defeated by Atla and Eclair using Hengen Muso techniques after Naofumi realizes the Dragon is now subject to the same weaknesses as he is. No longer able to maintain his physical form, he retreats to inside of the Legendary Shield and Filo's body, vowing to return should Naofumi allow his rage to take control again. ; : The former Seven Star Whip Hero. A nobleman of Faubrey and having helped his country advance militarily, Takt was labeled as a genius and chosen to wield the Seven Star Whip. Thanks to his status, he created a harem of women followers, many of whom were power-hungry in their own right, and uncovered the method to overcome the regular level cap of the world, as well as brainwash other women into servitude. :Given the ability to steal and use multiple Seven Star & Legendary Weapons by the Vanguards of the Waves, Takt began a power hungry crusade to take over the world. Together with his allies, he secretly assassinated the Seven Star Claw, Axe, Projectile, and Hammer Heroes, and overthrow the entire Faubrey royal family. Later, in an attempt to steal the power of the Legendary Weapons, he secretly interferes with the battle against Guardian Beast Phoenixes. : Upon hearing that Takt single handily defeated the Guardian Beast Kirin, Naofumi and the Legendary Heroes request an audience with the King of Faubrey, whereby Takt reveals himself; stealing the Legendary Shield, fatally wounding Mirellia, and declaring war on Melromarc. : Having been given temporary possession of the Seven Star Staff, Naofumi and his party use their superior training to defeat Takt and strip him of his control over his stolen weapons. Captured by Melromarc's allied army, Takt and his followers are tortured and executed. Initially confident he'll be resurrected by his benefactor and take revenge for the deaths of his followers, he eventually relents. Before he is able to reveal the source of his power, however, his head magically explodes with his soul being destroyed. ==Supporting characters== ===Party members=== ; : :The second princess and heir to Melromarc's throne. Unlike her older sister, she is good-natured and kind. She holds extreme fondness for Filolials and quickly becomes Filo's best friend. Initially, Naofumi assumed she was like her sister, ignoring her attempts to have him repair relations with her father. Only after being nearly assassinated by her sister and same knights who protected her, Naofumi accepts her as an ally, offering his protection. She later leaves Naofumi's party to focus on her responsibilities to her kingdom. :Melty specializes in water magic and is a skilled diplomat, having traveled the world with her mother. Often teasing her young age, Naofumi respects her wisdom and governing ability and hopes to leave Filo in her care should he return home. To her embarrassment, she is egged on by her mother to try and marry him, believing their marriage would bring peace with demi-human nations. After her mother's death, she is crowned as the new Queen. ; : :Raphtalia's childhood friend, a Dog Demi-human. In the web novel she was one of the first batch of slaves from the village that Naofumi bought, while in the light novel she was imprisoned in the dungeon of the noble who'd previously tortured Raphtalia. Initially jealous of Naofumi's relationship with Raphtalia, she comes to view him as an older brother figure giving him the nickname: \\"Bubba Shield.\\" Wanting to help protect her friends, she asks to join Naofumi's party as well as choosing to become his slave as to take advantage of the stat bonuses of the Legendary Shield. She later becomes the unofficial leader of Naofumi's younger slaves, often poking holes in Naofumi's attempts to act tough and helping train to defend themselves. She also assists in Naofumi's merchant business, dressing up to help attract customers of both genders. :Wanting to be like her Father, Keel initially thought she was a boy; having not learned the differences between genders. It is only after her friends point out her misconception does she come to realize her misunderstanding. Initially distraught, Naofumi comforts her, explaining and reaffirming his belief in gender equality; stating she's still welcome in his party. She later gains the ability to use a Therianthrope form, resembling a puppy. ; : A Noblewoman & Knight of Melromarc. The daughter of a nobleman selected by Mirellia to watch over a Demi-human friendly province. Shortly after the first Wave, of which her father fell victim to, she conducted her own investigation into the Royal Knights that had enslaved Raphtalia's village but was charged with treason and imprisoned by the Church of the Three Heroes. Upon Mirellia's return, she is released and tasked with helping train the Legendary Heroes' Parties; though only Naofumi's party take her instruction seriously. : Appointed to look after her late father's territory, she and Naofumi often argue with each other over her greater interest in training instead of governing and Naofumi's morals. Despite this, Naofumi respects her as a swordswoman, being able to outmatch enemies of higher levels such as Raphtalia and Ren using skill alone and assisting in the battle against the Spirit Tortoise & Demon Dragon. : In The Reprise of the Spear Hero, having been rescued from her imprisonment by Motoyasu during his fourth time reset, Eclair joins him in acting as Naofumi's bodyguard. Thus far she is the only woman unaffected by Motoyasu's curse, which Motoyasu attributes to her strong moral character. ; :An Orca Demi- human. Hailing from Q'Ten Lo, Sadeena is a former shrine priestess. Viewed as a child prodigy within her clan, Sadeena was forcibly trained from a young age to act as the royal executioner and leading her to detest her family and Q'Ten Lo's leadership. Loyal to Raphtalia's Father, an heir to the Q'Ten Lo throne, she joined him and Raphtalia's mother in their elopement. Away on a fishing trip during the First Wave, Sadeena was unable to protect her fellow villagers or prevent their enslavement by Melromarc's Royal Knights. She tracks the survivors down to Zeltoble, and enslaves herself as a coliseum fighter to buy back their freedom and leading her to a chance meeting with Naofumi's party. :A motherly figure to her fellow villagers, she deeply regrets her initial failure to protect her home and Raphtalia in particular. Acting as an older sister, she tries her best to protect Raphtalia from her family history, knowing it could spark a war. An avid alcoholic, she often flirts with Naofumi, who unwittingly beat her in a drinking contest; though it is unknown how true her feelings are. An extremely capable veteran fighter, she possesses enough power to hold her own against Naofumi's entire party and willingly break free of her slave curse; a feat that would kill most. Wielding a trident, she uses a mix of water and lightning magic and can increase her stats by using her Therianthrope form. With Naofumi's assistance, she is later able to unlock her Beast Transformation, allowing her to fly through the air as if she was swimming. ; :A White Tiger Demi-human, and sister to Fohl. Blind from birth, she originally suffered from a weak constitution and a multitude of diseases. After being purchased by Naofumi she is given a powerful medicine called Yggdrasil, and boosted by the passive effects of the Legendary Shield, is cured aside from her eyes. Able to sense the kindness in his heart, she falls in love with Naofumi and dedicates herself to winning his heart and helping him fight the Waves. :Adamant and highly assertive, she often tries to micro-manage and speak on Naofumi's behalf, praising those who show him favor and vowing death to his enemies, much to Naofumi's frustration. She sees Raphtalia as her rival and becomes her sparring partner. Able to naturally sense chi to help her see her surroundings, she uses a gentle fist type of martial arts, often imitating the teachings of Hengen Muso. Considered a prodigy, she is able to easily overpower and outmaneuver opponents of greater physical or defensive strength, outshining her brother despite her lack of combat experience and former afflictions. :During the battle against the Guardian Beast Phoenixes, Alta sacrifices herself to protect Naofumi and the Coalition Army. Dying in Naofumi's arms, she confesses her love and kisses him, asking for him to be more aware of the feelings of those around him. To Naofumi's surprise, her body subsequently is absorbed into Legendary Shield unlocking the Blessed Shield of Compassion. : Alta's soul, alongside Ost's, now resides inside the Legendary Shield; later she appears before Naofumi to reveal to him the nature of the Legendary and Vassal Weapons, and warning of the dark entity behind the Waves. ===Melromarc=== ; : :The Queen Regnant of Melromarc. Initially away at the start of the series on a diplomatic tour of the world, Mirellia returns to help the Legendary Heroes defeat the Church of the Three Heroes. Furious at her husband and eldest daughter for their crimes, she disowns them and revokes their nobility as punishment. Outlawing the Church of the Three Heroes, she wishes to make things right with Naofumi and does her best to support him. :Specializing in ice magic, Mirellia is a skilled diplomat and politician and employs several ninja-like bodyguards called \\"Shadows\\" to keep watch on each of the Heroes. Naofumi comes to hold deep respect for her, having successfully convinced him to punish her family in other ways in lieu of the death penalty and noting the lack of international stability in Kizuna's world. Unlike most of Melromarc's citizens, she holds no prejudice towards Demi-humans and tries her best to improve relations by setting up friendly provinces. Despite their mistakes, she still loves her family and even goes as far as offering to take her life in-exchange for Naofumi's help in fighting the Waves; which he turns down. Mirellia later issues orders for Malty's arrest after she abandons Motoyasu during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise. : Joining the Heroes in their investigation of the aftermath of the Guardian Beast Phoenix battle, Mirellia is killed in an ambush arranged by Takt and Malty. Using the last of her strength, she asks her husband to put aside his differences with Naofumi and reclaim his role as the Staff Hero. ; : :The local blacksmith of Castletown, Erhard was originally an adventurer, making a living by traveling around and hunting monsters. One day, Erhard met a blacksmith, and was inspired and fascinated by the weapons he made. Erhard gave up being an adventurer and he, and another student, became apprentices to the blacksmith. Many years later, Erhard settled down in Melomarc, and opened his own blacksmith shop in Castletown. :Erhard first met Naofumi after Malty brought him to his shop, and became fond of the boy's haggling for lower prices. After he heard the rumors of what Naofumi did to the first princess, he became very angry. After encountering Naofumi again, Ehard came to punch him in the face, but seeing the look in Naofun's eyes realized that he was innocent. Erhard gave him a bag that included old clothes and a cape since Naofumi was wearing nothing but undergarments. Being the first person to believe Naofumi, Erhard‚Äôs store became the place where he and his party would go when they needed new weapons or clothing, and the blacksmith often gives him advice from time to time. ===Other characters=== ; : :Queen of the Filolials.

It is found in deep water in the Southern Ocean around the coasts of Antarctica and adjacent islands. A sea snail sometimes parasitizes it. ==Description== Notocrinus virilis is a robust, stalkless crinoid with ten arms (five arms, each subdivided into two) up to long. There are five deep radial pits on the centro-dorsal axis of the disc, forming a \\"radial star\\". There are fewer than fifty cirri at the base of the calyx. The pinnules that extend from either side of the arms are relatively short and are circular in cross section. The gonads are on the lower pinnules and there are brood pouches between these pinnules and the arms. This crinoid is dark red in colour, a colour that is already becoming apparent in the late stage, stalked larvae. ==Distribution and habitat== Endemic to the Southern Ocean waters around Antarctica, N. virilis probably has a circumpolar distribution. It is known from the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Orkney Islands, the Enderby Land, the Ad√©lie Land, the Balleny Islands and the Ross Sea. Its depth range is between . ==Ecology== This species can crawl around using its cirri and can also use them to climb to an elevated position in which to feed. Like all crinoids, it is a filter feeder, spreading its arms and pinnules widely to catch plankton and small particles of detritus from the water flowing past. The sexes are separate, and females brood their young in their brood pouches; the larvae may reach in length before being expelled from the pouch and falling to the sea bed, to which they will anchor themselves. In early deep sea research, organisms were dredged up from the sea bed but during the trawl, any link between one species and another was often lost. More recently, it has been discovered that N. virilis often has a gastropod mollusc, Bathycrinicola tumidula, attached to it, the first time a snail from this family has been associated with a crinoid. Research in 2007 by Schiaparelli showed that B. tumidula is parasitic on N. virilis, and no other Antarctic crinoids have been found to act as hosts to the mollusc. Some of the parasitic snails were found to have inserted their proboscises between ossicles near the base of the crown while others were attached between calcareous plates on the arms. ==References== Category:Articulata (Crinoidea) Category:Animals described in 1917 Category:Taxa named by Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen ","title":"Notocrinus virilis"},{"id":"60294174","text":"Lower Seyhan Irrƒ±gation Project () is one of the major irrigation projects of Turkey, which is located in the Seyhan River basin. ==Location== Seyhan is a -long river in southern Turkey, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

Cast in Brussels in 1891, Gloria Victis is one of two nearly-identical sculptures by Frederick Ruckstull (the other being the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, removed from public display in Baltimore in 2017). ==Description== \\"from the bottom of the pedestal\\", the bronze statue features an allegorical angel with outstretched wings dressed in robes with a laurel wreath on her head. In one hand she supports a dying soldier holding a battered rifle, while in her other hand‚Äîheld high‚Äîshe holds a second laurel wreath. On the pink granite base created from Balfour Quarry stone from nearby Granite Quarry, an inscription says, \\"Deo Vindice,\\" which can be translated \\"With God as our champion\\" or \\"With God as our vindicator.\\" The dying soldier was modeled from an 1861 photograph of Confederate Lt. Henry Howe Cook of Franklin, Tennessee. ==History== Gloria Victis appeared first at an exhibition in Paris, and then at a studio in a New York City, where it was purchased by the UDC as a Confederate monument for Salisbury. Raising the funds took about ten years. $9,000 was raised for the statue itself and $1,500 for the base. Anna Morrison Jackson, widow of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson, attended the dedication in Salisbury along with 162 Confederate veterans on May 10, 1909, Confederate Memorial Day. Frances Fisher Tiernan read her poem Gloria Victis. At that time the statue was dedicated to 2,500 Confederate soldiers from Rowan County. Although no minutes have been found, in 1927 A.H. Boyden said that he signed a resolution in August 1908 when he was mayor designating the site at West Innes and Church Streets. The resolution was recorded after Boyden signed a document stating \\"that said site shall be used perpetually for said monument.\\" In 1990, the DAC raised funds to restore the statue, which had to be taken to Cincinnati. The statue in 2011 In 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Historic Artifact Management and Patriotism Act, preventing any state owned art work or memorial from being moved without permission from the North Carolina Historical Commission. Exceptions included threat to public safety and agreement between a private owner and the government. That same year the Charleston church shooting led to discussion of moving the statue. On August 18, 2018, the monument was covered in white paint, apparently a response to distributing KKK flyers in black neighborhoods. On March 20, 2019 the statue was vandalized again with yellow paint. After the 2019 incident, a public hearing was requested to discuss the possibility of moving the statue. Despite the lack of official confirmation of Boyden's action in 1908, the city was given a legal opinion that it had no authority over the land where the statue is located. City council heard from speakers in June 2019. The city attorney said the 2015 North Carolina law prevents permanently moving monuments and restricts how governments can move monuments for reasons other than safety. Catawba College professor Gary Freeze proposed a marker near the site and new art work in the current statue location. More discussion about moving the statue followed shots being fired near the statue during the 2020 George Floyd protests. One commenter pointed out that it interfered with watching for traffic. Safety had been a concern in 1948, 1959 and 1964 as well. An online petition with over 7,000 signatures as of June 12 said the statue appears to support \\"white supremacy and memorializes a treasonous government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery.\\" Fame Preservation Group, on the other hand, claimed the statue represents those who fought \\"against a federal military force invading their land\\" and that \\"it‚Äôs been made part of Salisbury‚Äôs identity.\\" The group's petition opposing a move had 2,600 signatures as of June 12. Suggested sites were Salisbury Prison and Old Lutheran Cemetery. The city council voted June 16 to move the statue because of a threat to public safety. On June 21, the UDC signed the agreement to have the statue moved to Old Lutheran Cemetery in the 500 block of North Lee Street, where Confederate soldiers have tombstones; this location was discussed with descendants of those who raised money for the statue. The statue was moved July 7, 2020 and will eventually be transferred to the new location, which has to be prepared. ==See also== * List of Confederate monuments and memorials in North Carolina ==References== Category:20th-century sculptures Category:Allegorical sculptures in the United States Category:Bronze sculptures in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Salisbury, North Carolina Category:Granite sculptures in the United States Category:Monuments and memorials in North Carolina Category:Monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests Category:Outdoor sculptures in North Carolina Category:Sculptures of angels Category:Sculptures of men in North Carolina Category:Sculptures of women in North Carolina Category:Vandalized works of art in the United States ","title":"Gloria Victis (Confederate monument)"},{"id":"60294219","text":"Margot Clyne (born February 27, 1995) is an American professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:American female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Margot Clyne"},{"id":"60294225","text":"Danny van Trijp (born 24 December 1996) is a Dutch darts player currently playing in Professional Darts Corporation events.

Gladys, exasperated by her husband's intemperance, leaves him. Harry finds her slumped on the snowy ground and comes to her aid by hosting her in his modest attic. Then he realizes that the woman is about to give birth to a child, and immediately summons an army of midwives and doctors, who, after the birth, congratulate him, believing him to be the father. Harry sees his desire for family magically fulfilled, and busily takes care of the woman and the child. A palmist assures him that the child's father will never come looking for his wife and baby. The father, now repentant, instead, goes to look for them and finds them, looking out, on a stormy night, at the window of the attic. Gladys, however, has grown fond of Harry, and, in the boxing match organized between the two men, she encourages and supports him, because she wants to stay with him, together with the child. But this is only Harry's dream. In reality, husband and wife make peace, and, deeply grateful to Harry, greet him with a handshake (the palm of which Harry then looks dejected) and leave with their son. That same night, when the elements have subsided, Harry leaves the house, and - after seeing the lost rag doll abandoned along the street - goes to the fortune teller's window brandishing a brick.

Though descended from commoners and often described as the son of a barber, his family began its ascent in the 17th century since his grandfather was a hat merchant and his father a licensed surgeon, tax collector and a bourgeois of the city. Abraham surpassed them and experienced a meteoric social ascent in 18th century Paris, cemented by his being made noble in 1720. == His beginnings in Paris == === Decisive encounters === Abraham, the fourth of the Peyrenc children, was born in 1684 and baptized as a Protestant in the church at Aulas, a few miles northwest of Le Vigan. His father was a licensed surgeon. A country surgeon, whose profession dealt with the body, could at times serve as barber.. He was able to purchase the post of secretary to the king and lands at Saint-Cyr. Some of his children left France for England in order to continue to exercise their faith.. Abraham left le Vigan around 1703. According to some, he fled to Geneva.. where he met with members of the B√©gon family, who were also from le Vigan, and like himself had left for religious reasons. The B√©gons were in banking and following them, he took a liking to the business world. According to others, he went to Lyon, where he began his career as assigned and then began to associate with Simon Le Clerc, a clothing merchant. In either case, he followed a path to Paris where he gained wealth and converted to Catholicism. His biographer, the marquis de Lordat, writes: ‚Äúthe strict huguenot that he believed himself to be yielded at first contact with the larger world. It gave way in contact with an environment where one dreams only of material gain, of the accumulation of riches, and ceded to the golden calf.‚Äù Others prefer to have fun and tell a good story:. With this man who came from nothing to become the purveyor general of the king‚Äôs armies, Abraham is at the right school. He served as secretary, then right hand man, and eventually son-in law. He married Anne-Marie-Jos√®phe de Farg√®s who gave him three children, one of whom was Fran√ßois Marie Peyrenc de Moras, who became contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances to Louis XV. Doing so he followed the example of his father-in-law who was in his youth noticed by Lord Lagrange, a contractor in fodder and fortifications, hired by him, and in the end brought into the business. His marriage to the daughter of his employer was the springboard of his success, insomuch as he became a purveyor, one of the fastest methods to enrich oneself. === Farg√®s Company as a springboard into the world of Finance === Under the reign of Louis XIV, wars followed one upon another, and the Secretary of State at war finished each years‚Äô contracts with groups of several contractors called ‚Äúpurveyors‚Äù (‚Äúmunitionnaires‚Äù) which undertook to furnish bread rations at a suitable price, fodder, horses, food and clothes necessary for garrisons or troops in combat for the duration of each campagne.Th√®se intitul√©e : de la dentelle √† la finance: Parcours d'une femme d'affaires au d√©but du XVIIIe si√®cle (Universit√© de Louvain) These contracts could reach values in the millions of Pounds. The munitionnaires would see only a quarter of this sum. The account was calculated with of bills of exchange guaranteed by the War Treasury. The purveyor interested in keeping payments low would sed the price of goods with food vendors, by means of bills of exchange payable at a specified time with the banker with whom they were drawn. If the Farg√®s business was founded in 1710, it had its lucrative beginning well beforehand. Its role was not limited to purchases. It acted as banker by loaning out considerable sums. In 1707 it called its debts with the Comptroller General of Finance, being four million Pounds. The success of Farg√®s was linked to its collaboration with an international network of subcontractors and bankers wielding control over currency exchange and credit. Due to late payments of advances promised by the Secretary of State (Daniel Voysin de la Noiraye), Farg√®s was at prey to problems in the treasury in 1712 and 1715, and he had to suspend payments. He was however considerably enriched by dealing in bills of the War Treasury, just like Abraham. Abraham was apprehensive in 1715, after the death of Louis XIV, because the Regent decided to prosecute bankers guilty of embezzlement. Taxed at more than 2 million Pounds, he preferred to exile himself for several months in England. Having returned to France, he launched a new endeavor with Farg√®s. Since the revival of business was indispensable to the restoration of the Royal Treasury, the Regent gave his agreement to the Scotsman John Law, who founded in Paris, in the rue Quicampoix, a joint stock private bank. The financial system included in 1717 the creation of the French East India Company which rested on the development of Louisiana. Shares were traded for gold but they could also be paid through government notes. Prices rose, shares for 150 were bought for up to 10,000 pounds. The bank which became Royal was given a monopoly on minting coins. === Enrichment through the ‚ÄòSyst√®me de Law‚Äô === Farg√®s underwrote the French East India Company for a million Pounds and was counted among the great men of Mississippi. He sold his shares before the system collapsed in 1720. He gave 27 million in Letters of Exchange during the Op√©ration du visa for which he received 20 Million in new bonds. Having become extremely rich, he purchased two offices of secretary to the King, one for himself and the other for his father, the Royal Notary to the Monts du Lyonnais. With so good a master, Abraham Peyrenc as well made his way. He became one of the most driven bankers of the capital. As early as 1719, his fortune was made and he could retire from business and enter into government. In 1720 he purchased the post of secretary to the King and was given Nobility. He purchased lands. But his landed nobility was not enough, he wanted to have the status of noblesse de robe, for which he had to learn both Latin and the Law. He surrounded himself with masters who taught these to him and made him a lawyer, which was necessary for him to purchase the post on the council of State, which cost a fortune, over 200,000 pounds. Between 1720 and 1722 he was an advisor at the Parlement de Metz then ma√Ætre des requ√™tes. Being brought into the confidences of Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon, the legitimate daughter of Louis XIV, he was named her chief of council in 1723. In Mars of the same year, he became a member of the office of the Prime Minister to the Indes, and in August he was made chief Inspector. The crowning moment was in 1731 when he became Kings Commissioner for the company. A commissioner reports only to the Controller General of Finances, thus he was the true master of the company. His portrait (now at the Mus√©e c√©venol) is the proof of his social climb, and his entrance into the nobility. It expresses the desire to create a new nobility which attempts to follow the aristocratic model. The aesthetics of the portrait are attributed at times to Nicolas de Largilli√®re, at others to Hyacinthe Rigaud, hesitating between an official portrait, pompous and uptight, and a psychological portrait. Abraham Peyrenc, who acquired the marquisat of Moras, was eternalized in a slight three-quarters pose, smiling amicably, his look without insolence, in a curly wig without stiffness, dressed in silk velvet suit, adorned with lace. The human qualities of his personality are placed in the foreground, much more than his occupation or his wealth. The arms he chose reflect his path from le Vigan: from the opening, sewn with gold nuggets, to the brocaded gold band. === Purchase of lands and real estate === As a prudent C√©venol, Peyrenc retired from business, his fortune made, and used his money in the purchase of various lordships. Between 1719 and 1720, he acquired estates (worth 1,089,400 Pounds), and in the decade following invested 1,662,767 pounds into real estate. He seems to have acquired his lands whenever the occasion presented itself. Fa√ßade of the Ch√¢teau de Cherperine, built by the architect P. Alexis Delamair (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek) General plan of the ch√¢teau, gardens et park of the Ch√¢teau de Cherperine (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek). On , he purchased from the duchess of Brancas the lordship of Moras (near La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre in Brie), which was valued at 118,400 pounds and brought him both his noble title and his family name ‚ÄúPeyrenc de Moras.‚Äù On October 3 of the same year, he purchased from the Viscount of Polignac‚Äôs creditors both lands, titles, and dependencies at d‚ÄôOzon, Rioux, Saint-Amant, Roche-Savine, Boutonargues, Saint- Pal, Ch√¢teauneuf-de-Randon which were valued at 546,000 pounds. On January 4, he purchased a large house at Montfermeil four leagues from Paris, and on October 11 of the same year, the Barony of Peyrat, and on February 21 two building sites at place Louis-le-Grand (now Place Vend√¥me). He became lord of the city of Saint-Etienne en Forez, one of the largest manufacturing cities in the kingdom, with the purchase of his second Lordship title (at Saint-Priest- en-Jarez from the Saint-Priest/Durgel/Jarez Family, valued at 400,000 pounds). In 1725 he paid off the gambling debts of L√©onard H√©lie de Pompadour, grand s√©n√©chal of P√©rigord and marquis of Lauri√®re, in exchange for his titles (his third marquisat).Archives nationales, MC/ET/XCV/83 (12 July 1725) In May of 1728, he acquired the title of Count (comt√©) of Clinchamp in Perche, valued at 450,000 pounds, then in June, lands at Champrose, Menillet, Villemigeon near Tournan-en-Brie. Though already impressive, this list is not exhaustive and excludes several fiefs and Parisian homes rented out or purchased for resale. Having acquired through law two building sites on place Louis-le-Grand, M. de Moras asked the architect Jacques Gabriel to purchase a third lot on which to build two beautiful homes. The largest was sold to Jean de Boullonges, chief commissioner of Finance, the other to the marquis of Alleurs to enjoy during his life as well as to his brother le chevalier des Alleurs, for part of the price of the lands at Clinchamp. Plan of the ground floor, main floor, and attic of the Ch√¢teau de Cherperine (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek). In the country, the Moras family had a number of beautiful mansions among which were the house at Montfermeil, four leagues from Paris, and the ch√¢teau de Champrose, nine leagues distance from the city, also in Brie, Cherperine (Ch√®reperrine), Perche, and Origny-le-Roux. The ch√¢teau de Moras seems to have been lived in. The inventory after death describes a chateau whose interior was without lustre, of which the tapestries were old, the flooring and furniture used, and the mirrors and trumeaux coming unglued. There are portraits of the late Louis XIV and other kings or lords. M. de Moras liked paintings inspired by Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphosis, or motifs of flowers, fruits, and hunting, in the mansions in which he lived. The panel above the door at Montfermeil and in the h√¥tel de Varennes are examples of such. The chandeliers were of german cristal, the marble from Italy, the commodes of rosewood. The ch√¢teau de Cherperine served as vacation house in the pleasant months. In 1727 the Moras family lived in Paris in an h√¥tel particulier built by Jacques Gabriel which stands today in the Place Vend√¥me. Judging the habitation unworthy of himself, M. de Moras decided to have built another. He wanted to show off his magnificence in front of the old Nobility and to dazzle them with his Luxury, a revenge of the upstart. He therefore purchased large tracts of land at the end of the rue de Varennes, in a new practically empty neighborhood far from the noise of Paris, near the h√¥tel des Invalides. It was an uneven terrain filled in from old sandpits. The choice of this place for the construction of his Mansion was not insignificant. Besides its proximity to the Palais Bourbon, where the duchess dowager Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon for whom he served as Chief of Council, no other area had as much land available for construction. The building of Les Invalides resulted in the urbanization of this area still outside the city. Additionally, its streets parallel to the Seine offered land of sufficient length to erect habitations between courtyards and gardens. M. Peyrenc de Moras first purchased a parcel of 5 hectares and then exchanged other lands with the marquis de Saissac in order to have an area a bit larger than 1 sq. km. H√¥tel Biron, home of the Mus√©e Rodin Design of the jardin √† la fran√ßaise Elevation of the garden fa√ßade of the H√¥tel de Moras (now the H√¥tel Biron) Once in possession of the lands, he wrote to Jacques V Gabriel, the king‚Äôs inspecter general of buildings, who entrusted the design and construction of the building to Jean Aubert, one of the king‚Äôs architects. This building would later become known as the H√¥tel Biron which houses the Mus√©e Rodin today. Jean Aubert designed the h√¥tel in 1727, with a courtyard in front and garden behind, set off on both sides and erected in a real park, like a ch√¢teau.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/travel/a-paris-house-of-rodin-and- royalty.html It was simultaneously a townhouse and a vacation home. The parcel of such large size allowed him to frame the building in greenery which completely surrounded it, except for a part to the right of the courtyard. The gardens are visible from each room, even the ones on each side. A central corridor, an innovation from the 18th century which was only possible because a lack of central walls, distributed the rooms along both sides, with light coming in part from side windows at each end. Isolated on a platform a few steps up, the building has three levels: a mezzanine broken by windows capped in lowered arcs, a first floor, and a second level separated by a band of moulding. The main building covers a surface of 354 sq. meters, the main courtyard is 32 meters wide by 48 deep. The very large stables held 32 horses. The plans followed by Jean Aubert are in the purist spirit of rococo, in fashion at the time. The ground plans, cross section, and elevations as well as the garden blueprint were featured in Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel's Architecture fran√ßaise (1752). Diana Returning from the Hunt by Fran√ßois Lemoyne Plan of the ground floor of the H√¥tel de Moras (now the H√¥tel Biron)https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100070r In 1729, M. Peyrenc de Moras commissioned from Fran√ßois Lemoyne 18 decorative paintings, inspired by the Metamorphoses, most of which were to go above the doors. The great room was adorned with ‚Äúthe four times of day‚Äù: Aurore and C√©phale to illustrate morning, Venus Showing Eros the Passion of his Arrows for noon, Diana Returning from the Hunt for evening, and Diana and Endymion for night. The theme of the series was Amor vincit omnia (‚Äòlove conquers all‚Äô). == The Legacy left by Abraham Peyrenc de Moras == In 1731, the family of Peyrenc de Moras moved in. But the father of the house did not profit long from the magnificence of his mansion, as he died before the completion of the second level. His widow rented the house to the duchesse du Maine in 1736. At the death of whom, the heirs of Moras sold the building, valued at 500,000 pounds, to the duc du Biron. === A figure for posterity === The banker‚Äôs renown grew in his posterity, so steep had been his social ascension. It left none indifferent to him, earning the scorn of some, and the admiration of others. At the announcement of his death, the songwriter Charles Coll√© said: ‚ÄúWe lost yesterday one of our Croesus, M. de Moras, who ‚Äúleft between 8-900,000 pounds in interest, palaces, chateaux, great lands, and all this acquired in a short time. He wasn‚Äôt even 50.‚Äù Edmond Jean Fran√ßois Barbier wrote similar things about Moras in his newspaper. ==== November 1732 ==== Contradictory commentaries very often fall into gossip. Many remember only the old valet or the barber, others imagine he purchased silence about his origin by the generous loans he gives. The Vicount de Reiset is the most generous, who said of M. de Moras that was is respected and honored by all Paris society, adding that his widow received the most sought after men in town and at court. This was contested by those who imagine that she received needy gentlemen, obliged them in every way, and gave them good food and lodging. Hadn‚Äôt she as much as thrown her daughter into the arms of a provincial gentleman out of money who hastened to marry her once she fled her convent to join him? The death of Mme de Moras, on January 11, 1738, is supposed to have been caused by this scandal. Often illusions were made to her foolish spirit, sassy and stubborn. She is supposed to have lived a libertine and debauched life, especially after the death of her husband. It is clear that if the story of the marquis de Moras still makes it into the publications of the 19th and early 20th century, it is that of his ‚Äúh√¥tel particulier,‚Äù sold first to the duke de Biron, and then converted to the Sacr√©-C≈ìur convent, before becoming the Mus√©e Rodin, each time an occasion for journalists to bring up the story of its first owner, one so romantic it resembles a serial novel. === The Legacy left to his Family === Inventaire apr√®s d√©c√®s du financier Abraham Peyrenc de Moras (Archives nationales). In his lifetime, Abraham Peyrenc de Moras did not neglect his family. Thanks to his protection, his younger brother Louis became lord of Saint-Cyr and, in 1735, his daughter married Fran√ßois-Jean-Baptiste de Barral de Clermont, a councilor in Parlement to the dauphin and subsequently Pr√©sident √† mortier. The other brother who had no political ambition became the abb√© Moras of the congr√©gation de Saint-Antoine, in Metz. At his death, M. de Moras left his wife and his three children a colossal fortune which would be of most use to the oldest, Fran√ßois Marie Peyrenc de Moras, in establishing himself and becoming first steward and then minister. His youngest son, commissioner of petitions for the palais, died relatively young. His daughter Anne-Marie, whose incredible engagement to Louis de Courbon was broken off, ended up remarrying the Count Merle de Beauchamp, ambassador to Portugal. L' inventaire apr√®s d√©c√®s a √©t√© d√©pos√© aupr√®s du notaire de famille parisien, Thomas-Simon PerretArchives nationales, MC/ET/XCV/119 inventaire des biens apr√®s d√©c√®s () He employed various notaries between november 1732 and February 1733. It includes an impressive number of pages. It is true that the fortune of M.de Moras is estimated at 5,849,702 pounds of which 2,337017 is in real estate. Therein leases of innumerable farms in various regions are recorded: Vivarais, Forez, Auvergne, Limousin, Perche, Brie, Bas-Poitou. The leases of the farms due at Christmas 1732 alone, including those of mills, forests, ponds and tuileries, reach a value of 83,706 pounds. M. de Moras received in Paris the rents of 18 tenants at Croix-Rouge, rue Cassette, Place Maubert, rue de Vend√¥me and rue de Saint-Jacques. Many people owed him arrears on the annuities they contracted from him, among these the Duke de NeversM. de Caumartin, M. and Mme de la Rochefoucault (marquis de Bissy). His monthly salary is a drop in the bucket, compared to the previous sums: 4620 pounds. Among his ch√¢teaux and Mansions, only the ch√¢teau de Moras, de Champrose, de Cherperine, la maison de Monfermeil and l'h√¥tel de la rue de Varenne (which was later sold for 450000 pounds) are counted by his heirs on May 7, 1758. Excluded from this inventory are the house on rue des Capucines, acquired in 1729, the ch√¢teau de Livry, and above all the stock in the East India Company (125 shares), which represents a sum of 2,250,000 pounds. ==References== ==See also== * Le Vigan. * Museum of the Cevennes (Mus√©e C√©venol).

She moved to Sorbonne in 1930 and married Andr√© Amar, with whom she shared a love of literature, philosophy, and country. They had a daughter, Sylvie. Mesnil-Amar studied literature while Andr√© worked at a bank. During the occupation of France, she was involved in the Jewish resistance organization Arm√©e Juive (AJ) by providing funding and also working as a liaison agent. K.H. Adler, Jews and Gender in Liberation France (Cambridge University Press, 2003). She also wrote a column in the journal Bulletin du Service Central des D√©port√©s Isra√©lites. After the outbreak of World War II, Andr√© joined the Jewish Combat Organization and was arrested in July 1944. Five weeks later, he returned home, having escaped being deported on the last train to Auschwitz. The rest of his family did not escape, and died in Auschwitz. ==Writing== When Andr√© was held by the Gestapo, Mesnil-Amar began keeping a journal. Her diary, along with several post-war articles were published 1957 under the title Ceux qui ne dormaient pas. The book was translated into English by Francine Yorke for Persephone Books and published under the title Maman, What Are We Called Now? with a preface by Caroline Moorehead. The English title references the ways Mesnil-Amar and her daughter would have to assume fake names with forged papers during the war. Moorehead writes of Mesnil-Amar, \\"Looking back over her life, she felt a mixture of regret and contempt for the way that the Jewish families she had grown up among had believed so passionately in their own assimilation, had been so willing to adopt the customs and ape the behaviour of the Catholic and Protestant French, and had thus failed to see how profound the differences were between them, 'by reason of suffering and blood'. They had felt so good and so safe in this 'golden age', even after the advent of Hitler.\\" The Persephone edition also incorporates photographs by Th√©r√®se Bonney. Anne Garvey, in the Jewish Chronicle, calls it a \\"perfect piece of written heartbreak\\". Mesnil-Amar and her husband devoted their lives after the war to Jewish causes. Andr√© founded the Central Service for Jewish Deportees after the war, and Mesnil-Amar wrote articles for and edited their publication. She also wrote for the Journal of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, Nouveaux Cahiers, and delivered lectures on Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust. The couple were friends with Andr√© Spire and Edmond Fleg. ==Works== *Ceux qui ne dormaient pas (1957) *Nous √©tions les juifs de l'oubli == References == Category:1909 births Category:1987 deaths Category:French writers Category:Jewish writers Category:Jewish activists Category:French Jews Category:French women writers Category:Writers from Paris ","title":"Jacqueline Mesnil-Amar"},{"id":"60294413","text":"Pulsar is a steel launched shuttle roller coaster at Walibi Belgium in Wavre, Belgium. It opened on 4 June 2016 as the first PowerSplash model by German manufacturer Mack Rides. ==Characteristics== A view of Pulsar's turntable station. While one side of the turntable is lined up with the rest of the track, a vehicle can load riders on the other side. Pulsar is in height, reaches a maximum speed of , and has a track length of . The ride has two cars, each of which seats 20 riders in 5 rows of 4 riders each. The ride can accommodate a maximum of 950 riders per hour. The ride uses a turntable that enables one vehicle to be loaded while the other is running the course. ===Ride experience=== Once riders are loaded, the turntable station rotates to align the car with the rest of the track. The car then accelerates backwards over a small hill before travelling through a straight section of track. This straight section of track forms the ride's splashdown pool, which is empty at this point in the ride. The car then travels part of the way up a vertical spike of track before travelling forwards over the hill. The car then launches forward into a second vertical spike and comes back down before entering a third backwards launch. While the car is on the vertical spike at the back end of the ride's layout, the splashdown pool fills with water in approximately six seconds. The car then travels down the spike and enters the splashdown pool, which is now filled with water. This serves to slow the car down before it re-enters the turntable to unload riders. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Pulsar at Coaster-Net Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2016 Category:Roller coasters in Belgium ","title":"Pulsar (roller coaster)"},{"id":"60294451","text":"Di Lauro or DiLauro is an Italian surname, and may refer to: * Marco Di Lauro, Italian gangster of the Di Lauro clan * Cosimo Di Lauro Italian gangster of the Di Lauro clan * Paolo Di Lauro Italian gangster of the Di Lauro clan * Christian DiLauro, American football player * Jack DiLauro, American baseball player ==See also== * Pago del Vallo di Lauro, town in Campania, Italy Category:Italian-language surnames ","title":"Di Lauro"},{"id":"60294458","text":"The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System is a U.S. federal program within the U.S. Geological Survey for monitoring volcano activity and providing early warning to threatened areas. It was authorized by the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act on March 12, 2019. ==Background== Ash plume from Augustine Volcano, Alaska, Jan 12, 2006 There are 169 young volcanoes in the United States, many of which are considered hazardous due to their proximity to populated areas. The USGS considers many of the more dangerous volcanoes to be under-monitored, lacking adequate scientific instruments on the ground to measure activity and potential threats. Many volcanoes lack any instruments, and the seismometers at other sites are inadequate for useful analysis. One of the most active volcanoes in Washington, Glacier Peak, only has a single seismometer. Improved monitoring capabilities can provide more timely warnings for evacuations and emergency response coordination, and mitigate the impacts of the travel disruptions. Early warnings are particularly critical for air traffic control, which needs to be made aware of ash-producing eruptions in time to reroute airplanes. The USGS assesses each volcano against a 24-factor hazard and exposure matrix, and assigns a threat level of \\"very low\\", \\"low\\", \\"moderate\\", \\"high\\", or \\"very high\\". In 2018, 18 volcanoes were rated as \\"very high\\" risk, and 39 volcanoes were rated as \\"high\\" risk. The \\"very high\\" risk volcanoes are in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii, with the most dangerous being Kilauea. Some volcano monitoring has been performed by the Volcano Hazards Program, directed by the USGS, but the program lacks sufficient funding to properly close the monitoring gap. According to Charles Mandeville, the program coordinator for the USGS Volcano Hazards Program, the USGS is \\"somewhere between 30-40 percent of the way to having an ideal monitoring network for those volcanoes‚Äù. As of 2018, only three \\"very high risk\\" volcanoes are categorized as \\"well monitored\\": Kilauea, Mount St. Helens, and Long Valley Caldera. ==Purpose== The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System has two purposes: *To \\"organize, modernize, standardize, and stabilize the monitoring systems of the volcano observatories in the United States, which includes the Alaska Volcano Observatory, California Volcano Observatory, Cascades Volcano Observatory, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory\\". *To \\"unify the monitoring systems of volcano observatories in the United States into a single interoperative system\\". ==Details== The USGS must submit a five-year plan for monitoring all U.S. volcanoes at a level commensurate with the threat posed by each. The plan will include upgrades to existing networks on monitored volcanoes and installing networks on unmonitored volcanoes, as well as standardizing on modern tools across all of the volcano observatories. A national volcano data center will coordinate activities among the observatories. A watch office will be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In addition, the USGS will set up a grants program to support research into techniques for monitoring and analyzing volcanic activity. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System was authorized $55,000,000 for fiscal years 2019 through 2023, however the funds still need to be appropriated. ==References== ==Further reading== *Observing the Volcano World: Volcano Crisis Communication *An assessment of volcanic threat and monitoring capabilities in the United States: framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System *Instrumentation Recommendations for Volcano Monitoring at U.S. Volcanoes Under the National Volcano Early Warning System ==External links== *Monitoring Volcanoes (National Park Service) Category:Volcanology Category:United States Geological Survey Category:Volcano monitoring ","title":"National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System"},{"id":"60294468","text":"David Paulsen may refer to: *David Paulsen (producer), American screenwriter. *David L.

Greene received excellent grades in school, and planned on attending West Point, but after his older brother who was attending the Academy died, his mother forbid it. Greene attended Harvard University. ===Greene Rifle=== Greene, college educated and obsessed with the military and technology, designed and patented many rifles. He invented the Greene Rifle, which was the only bolt action rifle to see combat use during the American Civil War. Greene also designed a similar weapon for the cavalry, the Greene Carbine. These were somewhat ineffective for cavalry use, because the primer would often fall out. In total, 900 of the Greene Rifles saw service by the US Government. ===Service in the American Civil War=== On 23 July 1860, Greene joined the 5th Massachusetts Militia Regiment, being its Lieutenant Colonel when the civil war began. On June 26, 1861, he was transferred to the 17th US Infantry Regiment. He was stationed at Ft. Preble, while the rest of his regiment fought in early battles in the East. In late June, 1863, Greene finally took command of the 17th Infantry. During the Battle of Gettysburg, Greene commanded the unit during heavy fighting in the Wheatfield, where the regiment lost 25 killed and 125 wounded. A monument to the 17th Infantry Regiment, inscribed with Greene's name, was erected on the site. Following the Battle of Chickamauga, on September 20, 1863, Greene was promoted to full colonel and transferred to the 6th US Infantry. On 13 April 1865, Colonel James D. Greene was promoted to Brevet Brigadier General. Greene resigned his commission on 25 June 1867, after nearly 7 years of service. ===Later life=== After resigning his commission in 1867, Greene continued inventing service rifles. Greene became a member of Grand Army of the Republic Post #11 in Charlestown, MA.

He succeeded his father in 1587 and was knighted in 1603. He attached himself to Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton and the latter's nephew, Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk. With the help of those connections he held a number of public commissions and offices, including those of Esquire of the Body (c.1605‚Äìc.1608), Gentleman of the Privy Chamber (by 1615) and Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance from 1608 to 1616. He was elected Member of Parliament for Malmesbury in 1604 and 1614, a seat then under the control of the Earls of Suffolk. He served as High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1601‚Äì02. He purchased one of the earliest baronetcies in 1611 but was unable or unwilling to pay the whole price. He was also found to have embezzled large amounts of money from the Ordnance, and died intestate in 1620 as a debtor in the Fleet Prison. He had married 3 times; firstly after 1588 Anne, the daughter of Sir Valentine Browne of Croft, Lincolnshire, secondly Elizabeth, the daughter of Marmaduke Tyrwhitt, of Scotter, Lincolnshire and thirdly by 1592, Elizabeth, the daughter of William Tuthill of Newton, Norfolk. He left one surviving son and a daughter by his third wife. After his death, an irregularity was discovered in the register of baronets, which meant that the surviving son, Thomas, could not automatically inherit the baronetcy. On 27 October 1624 the baronetcy was therefore recreated for him but became extinct when the unmarried Sir Thomas was killed at the Battle of Naseby in 1645. ==References== Category:1560s births Category:1620 deaths Category:Alumni of Exeter College, Oxford Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:High Sheriffs of Lincolnshire Category:English MPs 1604‚Äì1611 Category:English MPs 1614 ","title":"Sir Roger Dalison, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"60294623","text":"Operation Redfold is a defence contingency plan of the United Kingdom designed to guide military aid to civil authorities in the event of a generalised emergency arising during the post-Brexit period.

She earned a Master of public health at Yale School of Medicine in 1990 where she evaluated the prevalence of medication in early pregnancy and how it related to maternal characteristics. She found that women who use more over-the- counter and prescription drugs are more likely to be white, smoke more than 30 cigarettes a day and smoke marijuana. She joined the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research where she worked as a Senior Researcher in perinatal epidemiology. In 2000, she completed her doctorate in epidemiology at Leiden University. Her work considered IVF pregnancies and their follow-up. == Research and career == Buitendijk was appointed Head of the Perinatal Epidemiology section at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research. She worked on fetal and infant health, and the ability of the European Union to produce indicators to assess perinatal health. She was appointed Professor of Preventive Healthcare for Children at the Leiden University Medical Center in 2011. She was the first person to hold a Chair in Primary Care Obstetrics in the Netherlands. That year she was also made Vice Rector Magnificus and joined the Executive Board at Leiden University. Buitendijk led several strategies to improve the educational experiences of students, encouraging innovative teaching practises. She was responsible for the education, policy and diversity initiatives. Under Buitendijk's leadership, Leiden University became one of the first universities in Europe to comprehensively develop massive open online courses and small private online courses. At Leiden University Buitendijk was made Professor of Women's and Family Health, and started to work on gendered research and innovation. She studied home birth in the Netherlands, finding that home births were as safe as hospital births. She has studied changes in the height and weight of children in the Netherlands and how perinatal factors impact the birth experience. She called for an evaluation and introduction of minimum standards into midwifery in the Netherlands. Buitendijk called for academia to become more empathetic in an effort to embrace diversity. She co-authored the League of European Research Universities' Women, research and universities: excellence without gender bias, a call-to-arms for universities looking to address the underrepresentation of women in academia. In the report, Buitendijk suggests committed leadership from the top, as well as introducing concrete measures that are targeted to specific career stages, transparency, accountability and monitoring, as well as active promotion of a gender dimension in research. Buitendijk called for The Lancet to require analysis of sex and gender when selecting papers for publication. In 2016, Buitendijk joined Imperial College London as a Vice Provost for Education. There, she hosted the first Microsoft Campus Connections Summit to be held outside America. Buitendijk partnered Imperial College with Coursera, creating a series of online courses around artificial intelligence. She launched the College's new teaching and learning strategy.

It was convened under the pressure of the Bolsheviks on the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the First Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. ==Background== During the autumn of 1917, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) launched an activity to win a majority in the Soviets, primarily in Petrograd and Moscow. On September 17, Bolshevik Viktor Nogin was elected Chairman of the Moscow Council Presidium; on September 20, Lev Trotsky was elected Chairman of the Petrograd Council. The Bolsheviks occupy up to 90% of the seats in the Petrograd Soviet and up to 60% in the Moscow Soviet. As early as the end of September 1917, the Bolsheviks set a course for the conquest of the majority in the All-Russian Soviet organs, for which it was necessary to obtain a majority at the corresponding congresses of the soviets. The decision to hold the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in September was made by the First Congress, but the All-Russian Central Executive Committee sabotaged its meeting, not wanting to yield power to the strengthened Bolsheviks. At the end of September, the executive committee of the Bolshevik Petrograd Soviet sent to 69 local Soviets and army soldiers' committees a request their attitude towards the convocation of the Second Congress. This idea was met with hostility by the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. Of the 69 organs requested, only 8 responded positively. The reaction of the Socialist Revolutionary-Menshevik army committees, which recognized the convocation of the Congress \\"untimely\\", was particularly harsh. The Bolshevization of the Soviets took place against the background of an aggravated political and military situation: the Provisional Government, after long delays, finally called elections to the Constituent Assembly for November 12, and its first meeting ‚Äì for November 28. The situation at the front during this period also deteriorated greatly: on October 16, an order was issued for the evacuation of Revel, on October 21, the Germans captured the Moonsund Islands, threatening Petrograd directly. The General Rehearsal of the Second Congress for the Bolsheviks was the First Congress of the Soviets of the Northern Region organized by them in October, the lion's share of whose delegates were representatives of Petrograd and the Baltic Fleet, which were significantly Bolshevik by that time. As Richard Pipes claimed, this Congress was convened with a number of violations by the unrecognized Regional Committee of the Army, Navy and Workers of Finland. Among the delegates were even representatives of the Moscow province, not included in the Northern region. The Bolsheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries sharply prevailed in the Congress. Following its results, the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary Northern Regional Committee was elected, starting from October 16, began work on the convocation of the Second Congress. All this activity of the Bolsheviks was in no way coordinated with the old Soviet bodies, the majority of which remained Socialist Revolutionary- Menshevik (the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the First Congress of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the First Congress of Soviets of Peasant Deputies), army committees, the Central Executive Committee of the Navy. On October 19, the official Soviet newspaper Izvestia noted that Nevertheless, the All- Russian Central Executive Committee agreed to convene a Congress, having achieved only its postponement from October 20 to October 25. Preparation of the Congress was the reason for the differences between Lenin and Trotsky. While Lenin demanded to start an armed uprising, not waiting for the Congress, Trotsky managed to convince the majority of the Central Committee to postpone the uprising until the beginning of its convocation. According to Richard Pipes, this strategy turned out to be \\"more realistic\\": the establishment of Bolshevik power was \\"disguised\\" as the seizure of power by non-partisan Soviets. According to the description of Trotsky himself, ==Chronicle of the Congress== Speech by Vladimir Lenin at the 2nd Congress of Soviets. Artist Vladimir Serov, 1955. Mark, Soviet Union. 50 heroic years. (Denomination: 4 kopecks, 1967) The second congress held two plenary sessions. === Plenary Session of November 7, 1917 === The first session of the congress ran from 10:45 pm on November 7 (OS:October 25) to 6 am on November 8 (OS: October 26) of 1917. The congress was opened by the Menshevik Dan on November 7 at 10:45 pm, at the height of the armed uprising that began in Petrograd; the opening session was attended by many delegates from the socialist parties coming from all over Russia, from a variety of sectors of society. On the eve of the October Revolution there were 1429 Soviets of workers, soldiers and peasants' deputies. At the congress, a total of 402 Soviets of Russia, out of all the 1,429 mentioned, were represented in the Congress:Vladimir Shestakov. The newest history of Russia *195 united Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies *119 Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies with the participation of peasant deputies representating rural farmers *46 Soviets of Workers' Deputies *22 Soviets of Soldiers and Sailors' Deputies representing the Armed Forces (army and navy) *and 1 Council of Cossack deputies, representing the socialist-inclined amongst Cossacks within Russia According to the bureau of all factions, by the opening of the congress 649 delegates were present of which: 390 were Bolsheviks, 160 Social Revolutionaries, 72 Mensheviks, 14 United Internationalists, 6 Mensheviks-Internationalists, and 7 Ukrainian socialists. By the end of the congress, after the departure of the right-wing socialists and with the arrival of the new delegates, there were 625 delegates, of which 390 were Bolsheviks, 179 left-wing Socialist Revolutionaries, 35 United Internationalists and 21 Ukrainian socialists. Thus, the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition won about two thirds of the votes there. According to other sources, 739 deputies arrived at the congress, including 338 Bolsheviks, 211 right and left Socialist Revolutionaries and 69 Mensheviks. ==== The October Revolution and the work of the Congress ==== At the time of the opening of the congress, the Bolsheviks already controlled the whole of Petrograd, but the Winter Palace was not yet taken. At 18:30, an ultimatum was presented to the defenders of the Winter Palace under threat of shelling from the cruiser Aurora and the Peter and Paul Fortress. \\"Aurora\\" made one single shot at 21:00, at 23:00 an unmarked shelling from the Peter and Paul Fortress was carried out. At night, most of the defenders of the palace dispersed, and he was occupied by revolutionary soldiers and sailors who tried to make a mob of law over the overthrown ministers, demanding \\"pin them\\". At 2:10 am, the ministers of the Provisional Government arrested by Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko were taken to the Peter and Paul Fortress. On the way, in the area of Trinity Bridge, the crowd that surrounded the ministers demanded \\"to cut off their heads and throw them into the Neva\\". ==== Agenda of the First Session of the 2nd ARCS ==== The first meeting was divided into two parts: ‚Äì until the election of the presidium of the Congress ‚Äì consists of protest speeches of moderate socialist parties against the uprising of the Bolsheviks; ‚Äì after the election of the Presidium of the Congress from the Bolsheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries and the departure of the representatives of the Mensheviks, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries and the representatives of Bund from the Congress, the leadership of the Congress passes to the Bolsheviks. The opening session of the congress was accompanied by a fierce political struggle in which Trotsky represented the Bolsheviks as the most capable speaker. The peasant councils and all the soldier-level committees of the army refused to participate in the activities of the congress. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries condemned the Bolsheviks as an \\"illegal coup\\". Opponents of the Bolsheviks accused them of numerous frauds in the selection of congress delegates. On November 7, the old composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee also condemned the Bolsheviks, stating that The Central Committee of the Menshevik Party condemned the October uprising, calling it \\"the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks by military conspiracy against the will of democracy and the usurpation of the rights of the people\\". Menshevik Martov ascertains the ambiguity of the situation in which his party finds itself: on the one hand, \\"the power created by armed soldiers' uprising, the power of one party cannot be recognized as a country and democracy\\", on the other \\"if the Bolsheviks are defeated by force of arms, the winner will be the third force that will crush us all\\". As Martov puts it, the Bolsheviks demonstrate \\"the Arakcheev understanding of socialism, and the Pugachev understanding of class struggle\\". Menshevik Liber at an extraordinary congress of Mensheviks on November 30 declares that \\"if we took power, we would have been stormed both on the right and on the left, and the power could be kept only by Bolshevik methods. And since we are not adventurers, we would have to leave power\\". The reaction of the Social Revolutionaries was just as sharp. Thus, the central press organ of the Socialist Revolutionary Party,Newspaper \\"Matter of the People\\" // Great Soviet Encyclopedia: [in 30 volumes] / editor-in-chief Alexander Prokhorov. ‚Äì 3rd edition ‚Äì Moscow: Soviet Encyclopedia, 1969‚Äì1978. the newspaper Matter of the People, condemned the Bolshevik speech, saying that \\"our duty is to expose these traitors to the working class. Our duty is to mobilize all forces and stand up for the cause of the revolution\\". In its last appeal before the Congress, the Council of the Republic called the new government \\"an enemy of the people and revolution\\" and condemned the arrest by the Bolsheviks among the ministers of the Provisional Government as well as the socialist ministers. During the meeting, the delegates heard the roar of artillery; According to eyewitnesses, the Menshevik Martov started, and declared: \\"The civil war has begun, comrades! Our first question should be the peaceful resolution of the crisis... the issue of power is solved by a military conspiracy organized by one of the revolutionary parties...\\". After the election of the presidium which would be filled by Bolshevik and Left Socialist Revolutionary members, a number of moderate socialist parties (Mensheviks, Right Socialist Revolutionaries, delegates of Bund) left the Congress in protest at the Bolsheviks uprising and boycotted it. They went to the City Council of Petrograd and formed the \\"Committee for Salvation of Motherland and Revolution\\" (it operated until November 10). In turn, Trotsky at the first meeting of the Second Congress declared that \\"the uprising of the masses does not need justification; what happened is not a conspiracy, but an uprising. We hardened the revolutionary energy of the Petrograd workers and soldiers, we openly forged the will of the masses for an uprising, not a conspiracy, \\"and called the departure of the Menshevik and Socialist- Revolutionaries from the congress\\" as a criminal attempt to thwart the authorized representative office of the workers and soldiers in the masses with arms in hand protects the Congress and the revolution from the onslaught of counter-revolution\\". From 2:40 to 3:10 on November 8 there was a break in the first session of the congress. ==== Proclamation of the downfall of the Provisional Government ==== At 3:10 am Lev Kamenev announced the fall of the Winter Palace and the arrest of the ministers of the Provisional Government. After this, the congress approved the appeal \\"To the Workers, Soldiers and Peasants of Russia\\" officially declaring the official overthrow of the Provisional Government and the transfer of all powers of state to the Congress at large, stating that from this day onward, \\"all power will now belong to the Soviets of workers, peasants and soldiers' deputies\\" within the territories of the Russian Republic. Ironically, it was Kamenev himself, who had recently opposed the uprising, had to inform the Congress of Soviets about his victory. At a meeting of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), Kamenev remarked that \\"well, if you did something stupid and took power, then you need to make up a ministry\\".Vladlen Loginov. The night of October 25th On November 8 at 6 am the congress adjourned for the day. === Plenary Session of November 8, 1917 === The second session of the congress was held from 21:00 of November 8 (OS:October 26) to 5:15 of November 9 (OS:October 27), 1917. At the second session of the Congress, Lenin, met with stormy applause, after informing the congress of the formation of a new government of the Soviets, read to the congress decrees on Peace and on Land. Further, Lenin proposed that the Congress should dissolve the old composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, choosing instead the new composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and form a provisional workers' and peasant government ‚Äì the Council of People's Commissars. The congress adopted (around 10:30 pm on November 8) the Peace Decree, which contains an appeal to all the warring peoples and their respective national governments to \\"immediately conclude a truce\\", \\"immediately begin negotiations on a just democratic peace\\" without any annexations and indemnities. The Congress adopted the Land Decree (at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of November 8), which contains the following provisions: * about the nationalization of lands, including those owned privately, and \\"its circulation into the national property\\"; * confiscation of landlord estates and their transfer to the disposal of the land committees and county councils of peasant deputies; * transfer of land to the use of the peasants on the principle of equalization (according to the labor or consumer norm); * hired labor is hereby prohibited within Russia. According to Trotsky's memoirs, it was he who coined the term \\"people's commissar\\"; later this authorship was attributed to Antonov-Ovseenko. At a meeting of the Bolshevik Central Committee on the morning of November 8, the first after the seizure of power, Vladimir Lenin, Lev Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Ivar Smilga, Vladimir Milyutin, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Jan Antonovich Berzin gathered. According to Trotsky, it was him who envisioned the term \\"people's commissar\\" and later on developed the name in which the new government will be formed, Lenin agreed, stating that \\"it smells of a revolution\\". The Second Congress of Soviets, acting on Lenin's proposal, enacted Decree no.1 officially creating the Council of People's Commissars, which, due to the refusal of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, included only Bolsheviks. Lenin was announced as its founding chairman. Trotsky became people's commissar for foreign affairs, and Stalin became commissar of minorities affairs. Due to the pressure of the executive committee of the railway union of the Vikzhel, the post of People's Commissar for Railroad Affairs was temporarily in sede vacante until it would be filled in a later time. At the second meeting of the Second Congress of Soviets, the left Socialist Revolutionary Kamkov announced that the left-wing Socialist Revolutionary faction did not intend to leave the congress after the Mensheviks and Right-wing Socialist Revolutionaries did, but noted that \\"the peasantry is not the Bolsheviks, but the peasantry is the infantry of the revolution, without which the revolution must die\\". According to the Decree \\"On the Establishment of the Council of People's Commissars\\" approved by the Congress, the Council of People's Commissars was formed before the Constituent Assembly was convened, and the government accountable to the Congress of Soviets and its permanent body in between its sessions, the All- Russian Central Executive Committee.Decree on the formation of the Council of People's Commissars It would be a provisional government that would rule until the Constituent Assembly can meet. Among the 101 members of the new Central Executive Committee (often referred to as the All-Russian Central Executive Committee) there were 62 Bolsheviks and 29 left-wing Social Revolutionaries, 6 United Social Democrats Internationalists, 3 Ukrainian socialists and 1 Social Revolutionary Maximalist. Lev Kamenev thus became the chairman. On November 9, the Congress issued an appeal to the local Soviets with a call to \\"rally around the new composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee\\", the powers of the commissars of the former (Socialist Revolutionary-Menshevik) composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in the armed forces (Army and Navy) and on the ground were thus dissolved, with full responsibllity falling under the new committee.Decrees of Soviet power. Electronic Library of the Faculty of History of Moscow State University On the morning of November 9, 1917 at 5:15 in the morning, the second meeting ended and the Second All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies' Councils, with its duty completed, officially adjourned sine die, with the ARCEC and CPC now preparing for the start of their work as the new legislature and government of Russia, awaiting the convening of the planned Constituent Assembly, beginning with elections to be held just days later. That same day, all the arrested socialist ministers of the Provisional Government were released on parole. Some of those released soon engaged in anti-Bolshevik activities. Thus, the Minister of Food Sergei Prokopovich was released November 6, but immediately joined the anti-Bolshevik Committee for Salvation of Motherland and Revolution and became one of the main organizers of the protest demonstration of the rebel members of the Petrograd City Council against the new government. ==Composition of the Presidium of the Congress== *14 Bolsheviks ‚Äì Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Alexandra Kollontai, Nikolai Krylenko, Vladimir Lenin (absent at the 1st meeting), Anatoly Lunacharsky, Matvei Muranov, Viktor Nogin, Alexei Rykov, David Riazanov, Ephraim Sklyansky, Pyotr Stuchka, Leon Trotsky; *7 Left Socialist Revolutionaries ‚Äì Moshe Baltekaklis-Gutman, Grigory Zaks, Boris Kamkov, Vladimir Karelin, Irina Kakhovskaya, Sergey Mstislavsky, Maria Spiridonova (in absentia); *1 Ukrainian socialist ‚Äì Pavel KulinichenkoSoviet Historical Encyclopedia ==Estimates== The Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was the second most important event after the armed uprising, the event of the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia. The congress actually solved the tasks facing the Constituent Assembly in the matter of choosing the form of power in the country. The congress formed the new composition of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the first composition of the Council of People's Commissars, issued a number of key decrees (Decree on Peace, Decree on Land, Decree on the Total Power of the Soviets,Decree on the full authority of the Soviets of November 10, 1917 decree abolishing the death penalty at the front, etc.). A well-known expert on the revolution of 1917 in Russia, Alexander Rabinovich notes: The Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik boycott of the Congress effectively unleashed the Bolsheviks, making the first composition of the new government 100% Bolshevik. The contemporary Nikolai Sukhanov in his fundamental work \\"Notes on the Revolution\\" mentioned with regret: Apparently, during the October Revolution and immediately after it, the establishment of a one-party system was not yet part of the plans of the Bolsheviks. By the autumn of 1917, Lenin and Trotsky managed to put together a broad coalition of radicals ‚Äì Bolsheviks, Left Social Revolutionaries, anarchists, inter-district and non-factional Social Democrats, which included Trotsky himself. The Left Social Revolutionaries took an active part in the revolution, actively supporting the Bolsheviks, including at the Congress of Soviets of the Northern Region, at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, at the Peasant Congress; the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee, in addition to the Bolsheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries, also included anarchists. If the first post-October composition of the Council of People's Commissars was Bolshevik (since December 1917 ‚Äì Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary), then the elected Congress of Councils of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (\\"Soviet parliament\\") had a more diverse party composition. Although the Bolsheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries secured a majority in advance, a fraction of the Menshevik-internationalists close to the Bolsheviks, also Ukrainian socialists, were represented in the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, there was one representative of the radical Maximalist Socialist Revolutionaries. Representatives of moderate socialists did not join the All-Russian Central Executive Committee because of their boycott. On November 14, 1917, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee adopted a resolution \\"On the terms of an agreement with other parties\\", in which it explicitly stated that it considers the \\"agreement of the socialist parties desirable\\". The terms of such an agreement were set forth as follows: In Soviet historiography, the Second Congress of Soviets was traditionally considered as a legitimation of the new government (\\"the transfer of power seized by the insurgent people into the hands of the Soviets was formalized and legally secured by the Second All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies'\\"). On the other hand, unlike the Constituent Assembly, the peasant majority of the country was not represented at all at the Congress: the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Peasant Deputies passed a month later and was marked by a tough struggle of the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition with the Right Social Revolutionaries. As Richard Pipes stresses, the total representation of the Bolsheviks and the Left Social Revolutionaries at the Congress of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies was artificially overestimated by about two times. In addition, according to the researcher, without the help of the Left Social Revolutionaries, who positioned themselves as a peasant party, the Bolsheviks would not have been able to seize control of the Peasant Congress. However, the Left Social Revolutionaries, following the moderate socialists, refused to enter the new government. On November 15, 1917, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Workers' Soldiers and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Peasant Congresses merged, after which the Left Social Revolutionaries nevertheless agreed to join the Council of People's Commissars, forming a government coalition with the Bolsheviks.Creation of the Soviet State and Law (from October to the End of the Civil War) ==Accepted Documents== Documents of the Congress (decrees, resolutions, etc.) that were adopted at the Congress with a date and quotations:Congresses of the Soviets of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in resolutions and resolutions. / Editor Academician Andrei Vyshinsky. ‚Äì Moscow: Bulletin of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, 1939. ‚Äì Pages 17‚Äì28 === First Plenary Session === *Workers, soldiers and peasants!

He was responsible for the Magen David being carved on the headstones of Jewish soldiers who died in wartime instead of the traditional Cross. ==Early life== Born in Spitalfields in London in 1868, one of eight children of Dutch-born Betje (Betsey) n√©e Van Der Poorten (1838‚Äì1883) and Abraham Joseph Adler (1828‚Äì1900), a Polish tailor,Rev Michael Adler, DSO, SCF, BA - British Jews in the First World War websiteMichael Adler in the 1881 England Census - Ancestry.com he was not related to the prominent rabbis Nathan Adler or Hermann Adler.

He became honorary chaplain at Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and Senior Master of Hebrew at the Jews' Free School in 1893. At this early stage in his career he wrote Elements of Hebrew Grammar (1st ed. 1897, 2d ed. 1899), and Students' Hebrew Grammar (1899). He contributed various articles to The Jewish Quarterly Review and the Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England. In 1903 he was appointed minister of the Central Synagogue in London W1, a position he held until his retirement in 1934.Jacobs, Jewish Year Book (1900)Michael Adler - Jewish EncyclopediaArthur Barnett, 'The Rev. Michael Adler, D.S.O., S.C.F., B.A. (1868‚Äî1944)' - Transactions (Jewish Historical Society of England) Vol. 15 (1939-1945), pp. 191-194 His book The History of the Central Synagogue, 1855-1905 was published in 1905 by The Jewish Chronicle Office. ==Army Chaplain 1904-1915== Rev Michael Adler in about 1914 Jews were only recognised in the British Army as a distinct religious group from 1889. The Visitation Committee of the United Synagogue were responsible for the religious welfare and spiritual needs of Jews in public bodies and it decided to include serving members of the British Forces in its remit and applied to the War Office for the appointment of a Jewish chaplain. This request was granted in 1892 when Rev Francis Lyon Cohen (1862-1934), minister of the Borough Synagogue, became the first minister to serve as a Jewish chaplain to the British Army, holding the position from 1892 to 1904 when he was succeeded by Michael Adler. Adler became a commissioned chaplain with the rank of Captain in the Territorial Force (London and Eastern Command),'With the Chaplain to the Jewish Troops (the Rev. M. Adler)' - The Jewish Chronicle, 14 August 1914 attending summer camps on Salisbury Plain where he conducted services for Jewish soldiers. At first the duties of the Jewish chaplains were part-time and included an annual Hanukkah military service initiated by Rabbi Cohen. In 1914 Adler officiated at the funeral of Mrs Minnie Solomon at the Jewish Cemetery in Aldershot in Hampshire who had done voluntary work among the Jewish soldiers in that military town.The Foundation of Aldershot Synagogue - Provincial Jewry in Victorian Britain: Papers prepared by Dr. (later Prof.) Aubrey Newman for a conference at University College, London, convened on 6 July 1975 by the Jewish Historical Society of England ==War Service 1915-1918== When World War I began in August 1914 many young Jews volunteered for the Army ahead of conscription and Adler realised that his chaplaincy had to become full-time so he applied to the War Office to serve on the Western Front with the British Expeditionary Force as a Jewish chaplain. The War Office refused as there had not been a serving Jewish chaplain in wartime before. In the first month of the War Adler wrote a Soldiers‚Äô Prayer Book which Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz (who visited France in June 1915) later enlarged. Adler requested the War Office that he be allowed to visit to the Western Front to assess the need of a Jewish chaplain there, which he did in January 1915. After he wrote a report for the War Office he was granted permission to serve on the Western Front, where initially he was the only Jewish chaplain.British Jewish Chaplaincy in the First World War - London Jews in the First World War The Chaplain General, John Taylor Smith (1860-1938), suggested that instead of the usual Christian chaplain‚Äôs badge, the Rev Adler should wear a Magen David to make him easier to identify, and soon after arriving at the Front Adler arranged for Jewish military graves to be similarly marked with a Magen David rather than the traditional Cross. Adler gained the support of Jewish communities in Paris, Havre, Rouen, Versailles and Boulogne. With financial support from Jews in Britain he arranged that the suppliers of matzah for French Jewish soldiers should also supply 1,200 British Jewish soldiers. The matzah did not materialise and three months after Pesach in 1915 he received a letter asking what was to be done with the special food that was awaiting distribution.A Century since WWI: Reverend Michael Adler (1868-1944) - The United Synagogue website As there were so few Jewish chaplains often the burial service of a Jewish soldier was conducted by a Christian chaplain. To assist them in this Adler wrote out the Jewish Burial Service in English and sent out copies to the Christian chaplains. Adler quickly realised that more Jewish chaplains were needed at the Front and he claimed that Jewish soldiers often did not receive the services of a chaplain for months, unlike the Christian soldiers who attended a weekly church parade. He persuaded the War Office to provide additional chaplains, and as the area occupied by the British Army overseas increased so did the number of chaplains, so that by the end of the war there was a chaplain attached to each of the five Army areas and three at the Bases. Adler held services in villages several miles from the trenches and men frequently came to these straight from the firing line. He also held services before large battles including a Yom Kippur service at Noeuz-les-Mines in 1915, one week before the Battle of Loos. He kept a register of casualties and sent details of the deaths of Jewish soldiers to their families. As memorials were erected over the graves of Jewish soldiers Adler took photographs to send to their relatives; he travelled long distances to conduct funeral services and visited wounded soldiers in hospitals.A Chaplain in the Trenches - Jewish Military Museum Collection Adler served for much of World War I as Senior Chaplain to the Forces (SCF) on the Western Front. In July 1918 his health broke and he returned to the UK with the rank of Major, commenting to a colleague that after he left the Front the Allies succeeded. His successor as Senior Jewish Chaplain was the minister of Bayswater Synagogue, the Rev. Arthur Barnett. Adler was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his service during WWI. Adler returned to his position as minister of the Central Synagogue in London where he remained until his retirement in 1934.Obituary for Rev Michael Adler - The Times - 2 October 1944 ==Later years== In 1920 in Birmingham in England he married Bertha Lovie.Michael Adler in the England, Andrews Newspaper Index Cards, 1790-1976 - Ancestry.com Bertha Lovie in the England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 - Ancestry.com Adler undertook the monumental task of recording the names and units of the approximately 50,000 British Jewish soldiers and sailors of the Empire and Dominions who had served, been killed or been decorated during World War I. This was published as the definitive work British Jewry Book of Honour (1922) with each copy being individually numbered; the book is now a collectors‚Äô item. In his later years Adler was very involved with the Jewish Historical Society of England, serving as Editor, and President (1934-1936). An Anglo- Jewish historian, Adler wrote on the Jews of Medieval England including a biography of the prominent medieval Anglo-Jewish financier Aaron of York, while his 'History of the Domus Conversorum'Michael Adler, Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England iv put the study of the Middle Period in Anglo-Jewish history on a new basis. These papers were mostly published in his 1939 volume of essays The Jews of Medieval England.Michael Adler, The Jews of Medieval Britain (Cheshire, Sheratt & Huges, 1939) He was the Chairman of the Jewish Central Lads' Club.

Evans was known for his portraits of film actors such as Darrell Foss, Marie Prevost, Louise Glaum and many others during the silent film era including director Philip Rosen. He is considered one of the creators of pin- up photography. == Biography == Evans was born in Columbus, Ohio in 1889. He was the son of a coal mine operator, who objected to Evans' choice to pursue a career in photography. Initially working in the eastern United States, Evans moved to the west coast in the 1910s to pursue a career as a portrait photographer in Hollywood, eventually establishing a studio at 6039 Hollywood Boulevard in 1915. At the time, Hollywood studio photographers focused mainly on shooting movie still images of sets and scenes ‚Äî actors and actresses were forced to find personal photographers to take portrait shots. This market niche was filled by professional photographers like Evans. Evans also did more traditional still photography for a number of prominent movie studios. Evans introduced several innovations to the photography scene of Old Hollywood; he avoided using fancy props, and rendered effects or backgrounds directly on photo negatives. Evans is also credited by author and film historian David S. Shields with creating the genre of \\"Cheesecake Photography\\", a forerunner to pin-up photography. Some of Evans' full body swimsuit photographs appeared in various media, such as in magazines and on cigarette packaging. During World War I Evans was drafted into government service and stationed in New York City. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant, and was involved with the growing field of aerial photography, for which he attempted to develop a new camera. In his personal life, Evans collected rare books; he was also noted as having been interested in religion and metaphysics. Evans died in October 1922 at the age of 33. === Legacy === Following his death, Evans' studio was converted into an art gallery. In 1929, his studio was damaged by a fire possibly set as part of a wider vendetta against still photographers operating in Hollywood. Evans' early death resulted in him fading from memory more so than his contemporaries, such as Fred Hartsook and Albert Witzel. ==Gallery== File:Roxy McGowan and Mary Thurman in bathing suits, with one taking the other's picture on beach, posed for Mack Sennett Productions (3b43826).jpgRoxy McGowan taking Mary Thurman's photograph File:Muff in hand.

Lilian Baylis, who then managed the Old Vic, established the organisation to build relations between audiences and performers at the Old Vic. The Old Vic Association ran several events during the year; the annual Twelfth Night Party, on or around 6 January, was particularly popular as was Shakespeare‚Äôs birthday on or around 23 April. The latter usually featured a host of Old Vic performers reciting famous speeches and scenes from Shakespeare. However, the Old Vic Association also began building an archive of material associated with the drama, dance and opera performed at the Old Vic. The Association published the Old Vic Magazine, first published in October 1919, Baylis persuaded directors, performers, designers, and backstage crew to write short articles on the roles they were playing, singing or dancing; plays they were directing or designing; and reminiscences about previous experiences in the theatre. In 1931, when Baylis re-opened the Sadler‚Äôs Wells theatre, the Old Vic Association became the Vic-Wells Association and the magazine was renamed The Vic-Wells Magazine. Under this name the magazine continued publication until the start of the Second World War. Leading performers continued to write for the magazine; for example,Robert Helpmann reminisced about touring Australia as a fifteen year old, dancing on the same stage as Anna Pavlova;Old Vic and Sadler's Wells Magazine April 1934 Ethel Smyth asked 'Is Opera a Wash-Out in England?'.Old Vic and Sadler's Wells Magazine February 1934 Peggy Ashcroft discussed 'My First Repertory Season'.Old Vic and Sadler's Wells Magazine September 1932 The VWA published two full length histories by Edwin Fagg - one of Sadler's Wells theatre and one of the Old Vic.Old Sadler's Wells by Edwin Fagg published by Vic-Wells Association, 1935; The Old \\"Old Vic\\". A Glimpse Of The Old Theatre From Its Origin As The Royal Coburg First Managed By William Barrymore To Its Revival Under Lilian Baylis by Edwin Fagg, published by the Vic-Wells Association, London, 1936 The VWA arranged many special interest lectures and in 1983 Ninette de Valois reminisced about how nervous she was when invited by the VWA to give her 'first public address in the rehearsal room at the Old Vic'.VWA Newsletter July 1983 ==Post WWII== After the Second World War the Old Vic and Sadler‚Äôs Wells companies diverged, eventually forming the English National Theatre, The Vic-Wells Ballet (the predecessor of The Royal Ballet, The Royal Ballet School and the Birmingham Royal Ballet) and the Sadler‚Äôs Wells Opera Company (which became the English National Opera). However, the VWA Newsletter continued covering activities at both the Old Vic and Sadler‚Äôs Wells. The historian Reginald P. Mander gathered reminiscences and anecdotes from chorus girls and stars and the VWA Newsletter is the source for the story about Lilian Baylis‚Äôs aunt, Emma Cons, not replying to Charlie Chaplin when he applied to work at the Old Vic, because he didn‚Äôt include a stamped addressed envelope. The VWA also hosted special performances such as the first complete UK stage reading of Dylan Thomas‚Äô Under Milk Wood at The Old Vic in 1954, starring Richard Burton, Emlyn Williams, Sybil Thorndike and Rachel Roberts, performed on 28 February and 17 March 1954, directed by Douglas Cleverdon and adapted by Philip Burton. Another VWA event was a performance of John Webster's The White Devil on 5 March 1961, at the Old Vic, featuring Stephen Moore and Barbara Leigh-Hunt and directed by Peter Ellis. Meanwhile at Sadler's Wells the VWA supported the European premiere of John Joubert' s opera, Silas Marner, in a workshop performance. By 1982, the VWA owned a substantial archive which it donated to several special collections. For example, Leslie Gordon‚Äôs colour film made during dress rehearsals for the opera and ballet during 1936-8 was deposited with the National Film Archive (VWA Newsletter January/ February 1983 p. 7) at the British Film Institute. This film includes a brief glimpse of Ninette de Valois dancing the role of Webster in The Wedding Bouquet. A major collection of clippings, playbills, scrapbooks, photographs and other theatre ephemera was donated to the Theatre Museum. Another major collection was donated to the Islington Local History Centre Special Collections The VWA also manages The Lilian Baylis Trust and the Ninette de Valois Trust, which make occasional donations: for example, in 1994 the VWA sponsored the commissioning of Pendragon for the National Youth Music Theatre. in 2005 an award was made to then emerging choreographer Liam Scarlett. In 2011, the VWA subsidised a restaging of W.B.Yeats's 1934 dance play The King of the Great Clock Tower at the Royal Ballet School, directed by Richard Cave. ==References== Category:Theatre companies in the United Kingdom ","title":"Vic-Wells Association"},{"id":"60295026","text":"Deportation Blues is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter B.C.

His research into the diversity of Australian resulted in descriptions of new insect taxa. == Biography == Womersley was enlisted for wartime service in two English military sections, during 1915 to 1917 in the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Chemical Corps, Royal Engineers. After volunteering to join the chemical engineers, Womersley was engaged to transport tanks of poisons toward the frontlines of battle and release phosgene, chlorine and other weaponised gases when the prevailing wind became unfavourable to the enemy. Womersley was involved in the earliest chemical weapon attacks on German troops during the European conflict, including the first British use at the Battle of Loos. His later employment in that country included a soap manufacturer and positions at the Entomological and Linnean Society of London. He left England for Australia in 1930 and began his life's work on insects of the Australasian region. The first position he held was for a division of the CSIRO in Western Australia. His career included the role as resident entomologist and later honorary, and retroactively, Acarologist at the South Australian Museum and honorary positions and president of the Royal Society of South Australia. == Works == Around 200 publications by Womersley gave the results of his work on the taxonmy of several orders of insects, the Acarina (mites and ticks), Apterygota (silverfish) and Diptera (flies), around three quarters of which concerned his eventual speciality, the Acarina. Herbert Womersley was commemorated in the names of genera and species.

During a run of a signal automaton, clock values increase all with the same speed. Along the transitions of the automaton, clock values can be compared to integers. These comparisons form guards that may enable or disable transitions and by doing so constrain the possible behaviors of the automaton. Further, clocks can be reset. == Example == Before formally defining what a signal automaton is, an example will be given. Let one consider the language \\\\mathcal L of signals, over a binary alphabet \\\\\\\\{A,B\\\\\\\\}, which contains signals \\\\gamma such that: * A appears in singular intervals. That is, the set of times \\\\\\\\{t\\\\mid \\\\gamma(t)=A\\\\\\\\} is discrete, and * A appears at least once during each interval of length one. This language can be accepted by the automaton pictured nearby.A signal automaton ensuring A holds discretely and at least once by time unit As for finite automaton, incoming arrows represents initial locations and double circle represents accepting locations. However, contrary to finite automata, letters occurs in locations and not in transition. This is because letters are emitted continuously and transitions are taken discretely. The symbol x represents a clock. This clock allow to measure the time since the last time where A was emitted. Thus x=0 ensures that A is emitted discretely. And 1>x ensures that no more than a unit of time can pass without A occurring. == Formal definition == === Signal automaton === Formally, a signal automaton is a tuple \\\\mathcal A=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,L_0,C,F,\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,E\\\\rangle that consists of the following components: * \\\\Sigma is a finite set called the alphabet or actions of \\\\mathcal A. * L is a finite set. The elements of L are called the locations or states of \\\\mathcal A. * C is a finite set called the clocks of \\\\mathcal A. * L_0\\\\subseteq L is the set of start locations. * F\\\\subseteq L is the set of accepting locations. * \\\\alpha:L\\\\to\\\\Sigma which associates a letter to each location. * \\\\beta:L\\\\to\\\\mathcal B(C) which associate a clock constraints to each location, and * E\\\\subseteq Q\\\\times\\\\mathcal P(C)\\\\times Q is a set of edges, called transitions of \\\\mathcal A, where ** \\\\mathcal P(C) is the powerset of C. An edge (\\\\ell,r,\\\\ell') from E is a transition from locations \\\\ell to \\\\ell' which reset the clocks of r. === Extended state === A pair with a location \\\\ell and a clock valuation u is called either an extended state or a state. Note that the word state is thus ambiguous, since, depending on the author, it may means either a pair or an element of L. For the sake of the clarity, this article will use the term location for element of L and the term extended location for pairs. Here lies one of the biggest difference between signal-automata and finite automata. In a finite automaton, at some point of the execution, the state is entirely described by the number of letter read and by a finite number of possible values, which are actually called \\"states\\". That means that, given a state and a suffix of the word to read, the remaining of the run is totally determined. Thus, the word \\"finite\\" in the name \\"finite automata\\". However, as it is explained in the section \\"run\\" below, in order to resume clocks are used to determine which transitions can be taken. Thus, in order to know the state of the automaton, you must both now in which location you are, and the clock valuation. === Run === As for finite automata, a run is essentially a sequence of locations, such that there exists a transition between two locations. However, two differences must be emphasized. The letter is not determined by the transition but by the locations; this is due to the fact that the letters are emitted continuously while transitions are taken discretely. Some time elapse while in a location; the clock constraints labelling a location or its successor may constraint the time spent in a single location. A run is a sequence of the form \\\\xrightarrow[ u_0]{C}(\\\\ell_0,I_0)\\\\xrightarrow[ u_1]{r_1}(\\\\ell_1,I_1)\\\\dots satisfying some constraints. Before stating those constraints, some notations are introduced. The sequences are discrete but represents continuous events. A continuous verson of the sequences (\\\\sigma_i), ( u_i), (\\\\ell_i) are now introduced. Let i\\\\ge0 integral and t\\\\in I_i, then * let \\\\sigma'_t be equal to \\\\sigma_i, * let u'_t be u_i+t-\\\\lceil I_i\\\\rceil with \\\\lceil I_i\\\\rceil being the lower bound of the interval I_i, * let \\\\ell'_t=\\\\ell_i. The constraints satisfied by run are, for each i\\\\ge0 integral and t\\\\ge0 real: * \\\\ell_0\\\\in L_0, * (\\\\ell_i,r_i,\\\\ell_{i+1})\\\\in E, * u_{i+1}=( u_i+\\\\mid I_i\\\\mid)[r_i\\\\rightarrow 0], * u'_t\\\\models\\\\beta(\\\\ell'_t). The signal defined by this run is the function \\\\sigma' defined above. It is said that the run defined above is a run for the signal \\\\sigma'. The notion of accepting run is defined as in finite automata for finite words and as in B√ºchi automata for infinite words. That is, if w is finite of length n, then the run is accepting if \\\\ell_{n}\\\\in F. If the word is infinite, then the run is accepting if and only if there exists an infinite number of position i such that \\\\ell_i\\\\in F. === Accepted signals and language === A signal \\\\gamma is said to be accepted by a signal automaton \\\\mathcal A if there exists a run of \\\\mathcal A on \\\\gamma accepting it. The set of signals accepted by \\\\mathcal A is called the language accepted by \\\\mathcal A and is denoted by \\\\mathcal{S(A)}. === Deterministic signal automaton === As in the case of finite and B√ºchi automaton, a signal- automaton may be deterministic or non-deterministic. Intuitively, being deterministic as the same meaning in each of those case. It means that the set of start locations is a singleton, and that, given an extended state s, and a letter a, there is only one possible extended state which can be reached from s by reading a. More precisely, either it is possible to stay in the location longer, or there is at most one possible successor location. Formally, this can be defined as follows: * L_0 is a singleton * for each location \\\\ell\\\\in L, for each transition (\\\\ell,r,\\\\ell')\\\\in E, the two following zones are disjoint: ** the zone defined by the clock constraint \\\\beta(\\\\ell), ** the zone defined by the clock constraint \\\\beta(\\\\ell') where the constraints on clocks of r are removed, * for each location transitions (\\\\ell,r',\\\\ell')\\\\in E and (\\\\ell,r,\\\\ell)\\\\in E, the two following zones are disjoint: ** the zone defined by the clock constraint \\\\beta(\\\\ell') where the constraints on clocks of r' are removed, ** the zone defined by the clock constraint \\\\beta(\\\\ell) where the constraints on clocks of r are removed, == Simplified signal automata == Depending on the authors, the exact definition of signal automata may be slightly different. Two such definitions are now given. === Half-open intervals === In order to simplify the definition of a run, some authors requires that each interval of a run is right-closed and left-open. This restrict automata to accept only signals whose underlying partition satisfies the same property. However, it ensures that at each time t\\\\ge0, \\\\lim_{t\\\\leftarrow x^+}f(x)=f(t) for f representing any of the function \\\\sigma', u' or \\\\ell' introduced above. === Bipartite signal automaton === A bipartite signal automaton is a signal automaton in which the run alternates between open intervals and singular intervals (i.e. intervals which are singletons). It ensures that the graph underlying the automaton is a bipartite graph, and thus that the set of locations can be partitionned into \\\\\\\\{L^o,L^s\\\\\\\\}, the set of open locations and of singular locations. Since the first interval contains 0, it can not be an open location, it follows that L_0\\\\subseteq L^s. In order to ensure that each singular location is indeed singular, for each location \\\\ell, there must be a clock x_\\\\ell which is reset when entering \\\\ell and such that the clock constraint of \\\\ell contains x=0. Any signal automaton can be transformed into an equivalent bipartite signal automaton. It suffices to replace each location \\\\ell by a pair of locations (\\\\ell^o,\\\\ell^s) and introduce a new clock x, such that for each \\\\ell, x_{\\\\ell^s}=x. Nearby is pictured a bipartite automaton equivalent to the signal automaton from the example section. Rectangle states represents singular locations. A bipartite signal automaton ensuring A holds discretely and at least once by time unit == Synchronization of automata == The notion of product of finite automaton is extended to signal automaton. However, such a product is called a synchronization of automaton to emphasize the fact that the time should pass similarly in both automata considered. The main difference between synchronization and product is that, when two finite automata read the same word, they take transition simultaneously. This is not the case anymore for signal automata, since they can take transition at arbitrary time. Thus, the transition relation of a signal automaton may allow transition to be taken in one or two automata. Let \\\\mathcal A^1=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L^1,L^1_0,C^1,F^1,\\\\alpha^1,\\\\beta^1,E^1\\\\rangle and \\\\mathcal A^2=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L^2,L^2_0,C^2,F^2,\\\\alpha^2,\\\\beta^2,E^2\\\\rangle two signal automata, their synchronization is the signal automaton \\\\mathcal A 1\\\\otimes\\\\mathcal A^2=\\\\langle\\\\Sigma,\\\\\\\\{(\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^2)\\\\in L^1\\\\otimes L^2\\\\mid \\\\alpha^1(\\\\ell^1)=\\\\alpha^2(\\\\ell^2)\\\\\\\\},L^1_0\\\\otimes L^2_0,C^1\\\\cup C^2,F^1\\\\otimes F^2,(\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^2)\\\\mapsto\\\\alpha^1(\\\\ell^1),(\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^2)\\\\mapsto\\\\beta^1(\\\\ell^1)\\\\land\\\\beta^2(\\\\ell^2),E\\\\rangle, where E contains the following transitions: * ((\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^2),r^1,(\\\\ell^{\\\\prime1},\\\\ell^2) for (\\\\ell^1,r,\\\\ell^{\\\\prime1})\\\\in E^1, and similarly for E^2, * ((\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^2),r^1\\\\cup r^2,(\\\\ell^{\\\\prime1},\\\\ell^{\\\\prime2}) for (\\\\ell^1,r,\\\\ell^{\\\\prime1})\\\\in E^1 and (\\\\ell^2,r,\\\\ell^{\\\\prime2})\\\\in E^2. == Difference with timed automata == Timed automata is another extension of finite automata, which adds a notion of time to words. We now state some of the main differences between timed automata and signal automata. In timed automata, letters are emitted on the transitions and not in the locations. As explained above when comparing signal automata to finite automata, letters are emitted on transitions when the words are emitted discretely, as for words and timed-words while they are emitted on locations when letters are emitted continuously, as for signals. In timed automata, guards are only checked on transitions. This simplifies the definition of deterministic automaton, since it means that the constraint must be satisfied before the clocks are restarted. == See also == *Timed automaton == Notes == Category:Automata (computation) ","title":"Signal automaton"},{"id":"60295240","text":"Carlanstown () is a village and townland in County Meath, Ireland.

The influence upon his work by painters of the Burgundian Netherlands, such as Rogier van der Weyden, especially in his treatment of light, may be explained by their presence in Spain, rather than by his origins. Even Guidol suggests that he began as a sculptor and may have started his artistic career in the workshop of Gil de Silo√©, who is believed to have been born in Antwerp. His artistic personality is largely defined by two works: Cristo de Var√≥n de Dolores entre la Virgen y San Juan, at the Museo del Prado; his only signed work, probably created between 1475-1480, and the Estigmatizaci√≥n de San Francisco de As√≠s at the Iglesia de San Esteban de Burgos (1487-1489).

She has written over thirty plays. She won the American Theatre Critics Association's M. Elizabeth Osborn New Play Award in 2018 for her play Airness. == Early life == Marcantel is originally from Jennings, Louisiana, the daughter of Greg and Jean Marcantel. She was involved with the local community theatre as a child. She graduated from Louisiana State University in 2005 with a double major in English and Theatre; she earned a master's degree in English Education in 2006. == Career == Marcantel moved to Chicago after completing her master's degree. She worked in theatre in Chicago and won the Emerging Playwright Award from the Chicago Union League Civic and Arts Foundation. From Chicago, she moved to Virginia where she taught English and playwriting at Emory and Henry College, and taught English and theater at Virginia Intermont College. She was a Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Fellow at the Juilliard School, where she studied under playwright Marsha Norman. She now lives in Los Angeles. She is married to sound designer and composer Miles Polaski. On July 4, 2010, Marcantel's series The (a)Symmetry Cycle premiered at the Viaduct Theatre in Chicago. The cycle comprises three plays, Numbfeel, Dumbspeak and Blindsight, running a total of about five hours. It follows the same characters through the three plays, several scientists pursuing their careers and love lives, using insights biology, chemistry, and neurology to explore their motivations. Marcantel's play Devour features Anais, a wealthy young woman charged with the deaths of three of her ex-boyfriends. Anais is a stereotypical \\"spoiled rich girl,\\" but the play digs past her surface to discover her vulnerability, \\"[forcing] the audience to care about this socialite-trash.\\" The play premiered at Chicago's 20% Theatre Company in May 2012. Her play Everything is Wonderful premiered at the Contemporary American Theater Festival in Shepherdstown, West Virginia in July 2017. In it, an Amish family who loses two children in a car accident invites the driver into their home. The play was inspired by Werner Herzog's documentary From One Second to the Next, which tells the real-life story of an Amish family affected by a similar accident. Writing about a 2019 production, reviewer Tina Collins calls the play \\"a thoughtful study of Amish life [that] slowly reveals the underlying complexity that characterizes the human condition as a whole.\\" Even Longer and Farther Away premiered at the New Colony at the Den Theatre in Chicago in 2016. In it, Elliot gets snowed in at a small village on the Appalachian Trail. There he discovers part of his family's history among strangers who seem to know a lot about him and his family. Reviewer Chad Bay called it \\"one part standard-procedure coming-of-age story and one part mystical folklore.\\" Marcantel's play Airness debuted at the 2017 Humana Festival of New American Plays at the Actors Theatre of Louisville. The play tells the story of a woman who enters her first air guitar competition, and was inspired in part by a former boyfriend of Marcantel's. The play The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel acclaimed it as the best full-length play of the Humana festival. It won the American Theatre Critics Association's M. Elizabeth Osborn New Play Award in 2018; he award recognizes an emerging playwright, and carries as $1000 prize. The San Francisco Playhouse commissioned A White Girl's Guide to International Terrorism, which premiered in February 2019. The play follows Blaze, a bored, disaffected teenager in rural Louisiana. Her YouTube videos depicting lesser-known female saints capture the attention of an FBI counter-terrorism agent, and her search for meaning \\"makes her vulnerable to some dangerous advice.\\" In the play, reviewer Lily Janiak sees an indictment of America's \\"devoting so many resources to perceived terrorist threats of a particular ethnicity, nationality and gender while we ignore how poverty, downward mobility and social isolation sow the seeds of radicalization right in our heartland.\\" Also premiering in February 2019 was Marcantel's adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play St. Joan, performed by the Delaware Theatre Company. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Julia Klein appreciated Marcantel's \\"fine job of judiciously trimming Shaw‚Äôs talky text,\\" but found that the \\"dialogue tends to slow the piece down.\\" Klein and WHYY reviewer Christine Facciolo both note that Marcantel's St. Joan strays further from historical reality than Shaw's original, and does represent a more feminist play than Shaw's. Facciolo notes that the play was timed to coincide with the centennial anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States, but that St. Joan may be a better class hero than a feminist one, \\"an illiterate peasant girl [who] could rise to determine the fate of nations.\\" Her play Tiny Houses will have a joint premiere with a production at the Cleveland Play House and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park in April 2019. The same cast and creative team with perform at both locations. The play revolves around a couple, Bodhi and Cath who have left their jobs in New York City to pursue Bodhi's dream of building a tiny house in Oregon. The plan is for Cath to finance the project and for Bodhi to build the house; but it is soon clear that Bodhi is a Thoreau-quoting dreamer who overestimates his ability to build the house. He describes his blueprints as \\"\\"It‚Äôs 10 percent how-to and 90 percent why-not?\\" Cath and Bodhi are joined by Bodhi's college roommate Ollie and his high school girlfriend Jevne in a building project that stretches long past the expected three- to four-month timeline, and eventually professional contractor Jeremiah hired to rescue the floundering project. The play explores themes of life complexities in the midst of trying to simplify life, and of what makes a home. Cleveland Plain-Dealer Andrea Simakis reviewer called the play a \\"perfect, timely comedy.\\" Cincinnati's City Beat magazine said \\"the confines of a tiny house pressurize the play‚Äôs entertainment quotient, even if these characters are more caricatures.\\" In addition to her theater career, Marcantel co-hosts the podcast \\"Hugging and Learning\\" with Andrew Grigg. The podcast co-hosts watch and discuss \\"very special episodes\\" of television shows from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The podcast began in July 2018. In 2018, Marcantel became a member of The Kilroys, a group of playwrights and producers working to enhance the recognition of female and trans playwrights. Marcantel said that she is particularly interested in improving visibility for trans and non-binary playwrights, as well as increasing diversity in theatre criticism. == Plays == == Awards == * Emerging Playwright Award, Chicago Union League Civic and Arts Foundation * Roe Green Award, 2018 * M.

He is the current spokesperson of the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN. Before he was named Vice Presidential Spokesperson, Akande was reporting for Empowered Newswire, a US-based news agency and was also a former North America Bureau Chief for The Guardian (Nigeria) in New York City, United States. ==Early life and education== Akande was born in Ibadan, Oyo State. He attended Omolewa Nursery and Primary School and Loyola College, Ibadan. He completed his A-Levels at the Oyo State College of Arts and Sciences, Ile Ife.http://www.nigerianbiography.com/2015/09/biography-of-laolu-akande- senior.html?m=1 He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Ibadan in 1990 and a master's degree in Communication and Language Arts from the same University in 1992. ==Career== Akande's career in Journalism started in 1989 when he joined the Guardian Newspapers as a reporter, where he covered education. Akande's incisive coverage of the 1992 ASUU strike exposed the impasse between the Federal Government of Nigeria led by former head of state, General Ibrahim Babangida, and the striking lecturers. Akande was a founding member of The News magazine team in 1993 as Senior Writer, and also Tempo publication, when the military government of the day banned The News for its staunch pro-democracy stance and reportage. He remained with The News and Tempo until he joined the Nigerian Tribune in 1995 as a Special Projects Editor and later became the editor of the oldest newspaper in Nigeria, making him the youngest newspaper editor at the time. He was forced into exile to the United States in 1998 after his story, \\"Who wants Diya dead?\\" was published; not knowing that on the day of the publication, the Abacha junta will declare Oladipo Diya a coup plotter. This brought him in direct confrontation with the military government of the late General Sani Abacha and he had to leave Nigeria about 14 months later. While in the United States, Akande worked with Newsday as an Assistant Editor. He wrote regular columns for Chatafrik.com and Nigeriaworld.com, two U.S. based award-winning news websites, and freelanced for the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News of Philadelphia and the News Journal of Delaware. Akande was also a Fellow of the Tribune Minority Editorial Training Program, METPRO. In 2004, he founded Empowered Newswire, a New York-based independent news agency reporting on Nigeria and Africa news from the US & North America. Akande is regarded as the only Nigerian journalist to have interviewed a sitting American president in the White House when he interviewed former US President George W. Bush, at a White House African Reporters Roundtable. He has also interviewed eminent personalities, including Billionaire Bill Gates in New York on different occasions ahead of his annual philanthropy report; current US President Donald Trump for a Newsday story on how a staff of his organization saved a suicidal woman who jumped into the Hudson; former US Secretary of States, Colin Powell, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York after he addressed a donors‚Äô conference on Liberia; and Nobel Laureate Professor Wole Soyinka. That interview led to Soyinka's eventual exile after Nigeria's military rulers then in power declared him wanted for his pro-democracy views. He has been featured as a guest on several international radio and TV programmes in the United States and Europe; including Air America Radio, BBC, CNN and the Laura Flanders show. Akande was the moderator of Global Information Network Roundtable on Africa in New York. He lived seventeen straight years in the United States and has travelled to several other countries in Europe and Africa on different journalism assignments, including the UNESCO General Conference in Paris, France.https://allafrica.com/stories/201505250264.html Akande has also taught at several US colleges including Suffolk County Community College, where he was a Professor of Communication, and State University of New York, Stonybrook, where he lectured on African history and politics. ==Work at the United Nations== Akande worked as a Press Officer at the United Nations Headquarter, New York in 2002. He wrote press releases on the proceedings of UN main bodies including the General Assembly, and covered press briefings at the UN, as well as other assignments for the UN's Department of Public Information. He also worked as a media consultant for the enunciation and implementation of a Communications and Advocacy Campaign strategy for the New Partnership for Africa's Development, NEPAD. He is a contributor to African Recovery magazine, a UN publication, now called African Renewal. ==Work with the Nigerian Government== Akande was appointed by Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari as the Senior Special Assistant (Media and Publicity) to the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. ==Articles and publications== *It Takes a Village,‚Äù the story of a family raising quadruplets in Queens--in Newsday Feb. 6, 2001 *Battering Walls of Legalization,‚Äù about immigrant women battering--in Newsday Sept. 6, 2001 *Reviled ‚ÄòVirgin‚Äô the new spirit of African art?‚Äù ---in the Philadelphia Daily News, October 15, 1999, page 23. *Reparations as real social justice‚Äù --- in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Feb 7,1999 - A review of Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka's book ‚ÄúThe Burden of Memory‚Äù in the Book review section *He is currently writing the Biography of Professor J.F.

Duretto and the description was published in the journal Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Girraween National Park. The specific epithet (inflexa) is a Latin word referring to the edges of the sepals, near their tip. In the same paper, Duretto described four new subspecies: * Boronia inflexa subsp. inflexa that has its branches and leaves covered with minute, soft hairs, and petals long; * Boronia inflexa subsp. montiazura that is glabrous with the end leaflet long and wide; * Boronia inflexa subsp. grandiflora that has its branches and leaves covered with minute, soft hairs, and petals long; * Boronia inflexa subsp. torringtonensis that is glabrous with the end leaflet long and wide. ==Distribution and habitat== This boronia grows in heath, woodland and forest on granite and in soils derived from granite. Subspecies inflexa occurs between Stanthorpe and the Girraween National Park and disjunctly in the Gibraltar Range National Park and subspecies on a small hill near Applethorpe north of Stanthorpe. Subspecies grandiflora occurs near Amiens amd Lyra and subspecies torringtonensis is restricted to the Torrington area in New South Wales. ==Conservation== Boronia inflexa subsp. montiazura is classed as \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. == References == inflexa Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 2003 Category:Taxa named by Marco Duretto ","title":"Boronia inflexa"},{"id":"60296898","text":"The mayoral election of San Jos√© of 2002 were the first democratic elections of the modern era to choose the newly created figure of Mayor and two deputy mayors (following the reform to the Municipal Code made in 1998), of the municipality of San Jos√©, capital of Costa Rica as with other municipalities.

She was the younger of two sisters; previous reporting erroneously described her as one of seven children. Nothing of her education is known. In 1831 she produced a family register for her neighbor Silas Kirby. The following year, on November 8, she married William T. Finch of New Bedford. Five years before her marriage, she gave birth to her only child, Judith, whose father was unknown and who later married mason Otis Pierce. William Finch died at an unknown time; Ruby is known to have been widowed at the time of her death in New Bedford from a tumor. It appears at the time that she was living with her widowed mother. Her death record indicates that she was buried in Westport. For many years, the only works known by Finch, besides the Kirby family register, were a series of half- and full-length portraits as well as two serial illustrations of the parable of the Prodigal Son. All are in watercolor, and evince a willingness to experiment; her portraits, especially, are distinguished by their individualistic details of costume and physical characteristics. She valued decorative qualities, and tended to avoid repetition; even repeated motifs are delineated by their varied poses. Her portraits incorporate plinths among their compositional devices. More recently, four more drawings were discovered among the effects from two former Devol family farms; also discovered was the only known photograph of Finch, taken six years before her death. Most of her work appears to have been produced to commemorate marriages or deaths, among other such personal occasions. Finch appears to have been accepted by her neighbors as a community artist, and many of her pieces depict neighbors and friends. Finch's depiction of the tale of The Prodigal Son, dated c. 1830‚Äì1835, is owned by the American Folk Art Museum. The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum owns her double portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Elijah Robinson. The Westport Historical Society owns her photograph and her portrait of Ann Potter. ==References== Category:1804 births Category:1866 deaths Category:American women painters Category:American watercolorists Category:Women watercolorists Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:People from Westport, Massachusetts Category:People from New Bedford, Massachusetts Category:Painters from Massachusetts Category:Deaths from cancer in Massachusetts Category:Folk artists Category:Women outsider artists ","title":"Ruby Devol Finch"},{"id":"60297124","text":"The New Disciple is a 1921 American silent film directed by Ollie Sellers and produced by labor organization the Federal Film Corporation in Seattle, Washington.

According to reports published on March 25, 78 people were killed and 617 injured. The State Council of China officially recognized the severity of the accident, often referred to as \\"3.21 Explosive Accident\\". == Description == ===Background=== The facility‚Äîlocated in Yancheng's industrial park‚Äîwas operated by Tianjiayi Chemical (), and was used to produce fertilizer or pesticides. Some sources reported that the plant produced organic chemicals, including some highly flammable compounds. Tianjiayi Chemical had previously been penalized six times for infractions of pollution and waste management laws, and China Daily reported fines over safety issues. This plant has had previous fires and deaths since there is not a government program to keep chemical plants like this one up to standard to prevent future disasters. According to the South China Morning Post, this plant paid bribes, paid journalists and local officials so this chemical plant could remain open without any negative publicity or reasons to shut down. This information comes from an engineer who helped to create this plant and other similar plants who have disregarded multiple safety regulations. Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang are \\"demanding the government to shut down these chemical firms when they do not comply to safety regulations it is so disregarded\\". On November 27, 2007, an explosion occurred in one of the chemical factories in Chenjiagang Chemical Zone (), with seven killed and around 50 injured. On November 23, 2010, more than thirty were poisoned by a toxic gas release. In the early morning of February 10, 2011, rumors of toxic chemical release and potential imminent explosions in the Chenjiagang Chemical Industry Park led over ten thousand residents to evacuate in panic from the towns of Chenjiagang and Shuanggang () during which four people died and many were injured. On the afternoon of May 18 and again on July 26 in 2011, there were explosions at local factories. ===Explosion=== The March 2019 explosion occurred at a local time of 14:48 (06:48 GMT). 78 people were killed, and at least 94 were severely injured, 32 of whom were critically injured. Around 640 people required hospital treatment and were taken to 16 hospitals. The injured included children at a local kindergarten. CENC detected an ML2.2 artificial earthquake whose epicenter is at .Calculated from of GCJ-02. The force of the blast started numerous fires in Yancheng, knocked down several buildings, and reportedly destroyed windows several kilometers away. The fire was reported to have been controlled by 03:00 local time. Considerable damage was caused to nearby factories and offices; the roof of Henglida Chemical Factory, 3 km from the explosion, fell in. At least one of the people killed was in another building destroyed by the blast. Windows are reported to have been blown out up to 6 km away from the explosion, and houses and other buildings were damaged in the nearby village-level administrative divisions including Hai'an Town (Haianju) () and Shadang (). This explosion was strong enough that it registered on earthquake sensors and could be seen by satellites. The blast created a crater resulting in a magnitude 2.2 seismic shock that took over 900 firefighters to get the fire under control. === Aftermath === The search for survivors was ongoing on 23 March; one survivor was rescued from the site on the morning of 23 March, but 25 of the 28 people earlier reported missing were found dead. According to the Jiangsu environmental protection bureau, the monitored levels of benzene, toluene, and xylene in the area were not abnormal, and levels of acetone and chloroform outside the explosion area were within normal limits. However, according to the South China Morning Post article entitled \\"Devastation at blast site after China chemical plant explosion leaves at least 64 dead, 640 injured\\" discusses the point of the surrounding three rivers were polluted with exceedingly levels of dichloroethane and dichloromethane by 2.8x and 8.4x of the national water quality standards. The 170 meter wide crater and two meters deep requires it to be filled in along with neutralizing the soil to prevent contamination to the surrounding community. \\"This chemical plant was flattened along with the surrounding 16 factories also have varying degrees of damage\\" per the South China Morning Post. The precise cause of the explosion is not yet known. There were no reports of anything abnormal at the plant before the explosion. A worker at the plant has reported the cause was a fire in a natural gas tanker that spread to benzoyl storage tank, but this has not been confirmed. According to Radio Free Asia, during the disaster, the local government used anti-drone technology to stop drones being used by journalists. The local government prevented outside media from entering the disaster area and hospitals to conduct interviews. Interviews were only granted to some in the Chinese media. On April 4, 2019, the Standing Committee of the Yancheng Committee of the Communist Party of China had a meeting at which it was decided to definitively close down the Xiangshui Chemical Industry Park. On November 15, the State Council approved the investigation report, presented by the investigation team of the State Council. The report asserts the explosion accident being a serious production safety accident: there was a long-term practice of illegal storage of hazardous waste, resulting in spontaneous combustion and explosion. The CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervisory Commission issued warning to Fan Jinlong and Fei Gaoyun, Jiangsu Provincial People ‚Äôs Government executive deputy governor and deputy governor, respectively. At the same time, investigations and criminal charges filed against 44 enterprises and executives, for illegal storage of dangerous substances, violations of significant labor safety measures, environmental pollution, and forgery of certification documents. === Controversy === Washington Post and the Financial Times recently reported about dissatisfaction and criticism of the Internet censorship growing around this accident, many news articles and social media deleted. According to Radio Free Asia, the local government dispatch drone jamming equipment and shoot down drones the report used for aerial photography. The government also banned foreign media from entering the disaster area or conducting interviews with hospitals. The \\"Beijing News\\" ridiculed the local government for enforcing the principle of \\"prevent fire, prevent theft, and prevent journalist\\". == See also == * List of 21st-century explosions * 2020 Beirut explosions * 2015 Tianjin explosions == References == Category:2019 industrial disasters Category:Explosions in 2019 Category:History of Jiangsu Category:Industrial fires and explosions in China Category:March 2019 events in China Category:Xiangshui Category:Man-made disasters in China ","title":"2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion"},{"id":"60297310","text":"Hanan' is a surname of Semitic origin.

Whittaker's research focuses on prehistoric technology and experimental archaeology, specializing particularly in stone tools and atlatls. He has also worked in natural history and ecology, zooarchaeology, and paleoethnobotany. == Early life and education == Whittaker studied anthropology at Cornell University. He began to learning to knap flint in his sophomore year, in 1972. Lacking chert or obsidian to practice with, he used the glass from broken soda bottles. Early on, he had to take a brief hiatus from knapping after he accidentally severed two tendons in his left index finger with a glass flake. In his third year at Cornell, Whittaker worked on the archaeological site of in France and studied under Fran√ßois Bordes. Bordes taught Whittaker learned how to knap chert and deepened his interest in the craft. He also met expert knappers Mark Newcomer and Jacques Pelegrin. Whittaker later attended the University of Arizona as a graduate student, where he continued to work on experimental archaeology. Along with his colleague Harold Dibble, Whittaker developed a mechanical device that flaked stone a controlled, repeatable manner. This allowed for the precise study of the effects of force on reduction angles. In 1979, Whittaker and Dibble taught a course on experimental archaeology and knapping. Whittaker obtained his master's degree from Arizona in 1979 and his doctorate in 1984. == Academic career == Shortly after completing his PhD in 1984, Whittaker began teaching at Grinnell College, Iowa, where he still has a position . He was appointed a full professor in 2001. Whittaker has worked on multiple sites and regions, including the American Southwest, Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Central America. He is best known for his contributions to the study of ancient technologies, particularly his work in experimental archaeology by attempting to replicate or approximate past technologies and testing hypotheses and theories about the cultures that used them. This has included research into bronze casting, foraging and cooking, flintknapping, ceramics, and atlatls. Whittaker has studied ancient and modern flintknappers in both the Old and New Worlds. His 1994 book, Flintknapping: Making and Understanding Stone Tools, is a guide to the practice of lithic reduction for academics and hobbyists, covering the history, mechanics, and techniques of flintknapping. Whittaker has also investigated atlatls, or spear-throwers. He is a member of the World Atlatl Association, an organization that promotes the use and continued research into atlatls. He is a regular contributor to the organization's journal, The Atlatl. One insight gained from Whittaker's research was the physical effects of prolonged atlatl throwing on the human body, a condition known as \\"atlatl elbow\\" (cf. tennis elbow). After years of prolonged use of the tool, Whittaker developed the early stages of the condition, which has also been recorded in ancient remains such as Mungo man. He used this opportunity to study the relationship between atlatl usage and human anatomy, establishing the causes of the condition and how it can be prevented by proper form and stretching. ==Awards== * World Atlatl Association, Top 10 Award, 2000, 2001, 2006 * World Atlatl Association, President's Award, 2012 ==Selected publications== * 1994: Flintknapping: Making and Understanding Stone Tools * 1999: Surviving Adversity: The Sinagua of Lizard Man Village * 2004: American Flintknappers: Stone Age Art in the Age of Computers ==References== ==External links== * Faculty page at Grinnell College * World Atlatl Association homepage Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Prehistorians Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Arizona alumni Category:Grinnell College faculty Category:People from Richland, Washington Category:Scientists from Washington (state) Category:20th-century American historians Category:21st-century American historians Category:20th-century American archaeologists Category:21st-century American archaeologists Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers ","title":"John C.

Edson was born in Halifax, Vermont, the daughter of Jesse and Rebecca Edson. Jesse died in 1805, and Rebecca married Captain Edward Adams of Colrain, Massachusetts, to which town the family moved when Almira was seven. In 1841, unmarried, she joined the religious community in Putney, Vermont, which had been founded by John Humphrey Noyes. There she fell in love with another community member, John R. Lyvere. The couple asked Noyes for permission to marry, but he refused; consequently, while he was away the pair absconded to Hinsdale, New Hampshire, where they wed on September 18, 1842. Noyes banished them upon hearing of their disobedience, and they moved to Vernon, Connecticut, where Edson remained until her death. Little else is known of her life, although she was the subject of research by Arthur and Sybil Kern. Edson is known as the painter of a collection of family registers which are unusual in that they also incorporate features of the mourning picture. Her first work to come to public attention was the register of the Woodard family, painted around 1837 in watercolor and ink, which was discussed by Jean Lipman and Alice Winchester in The Flowering of American Folk Art 1776‚Äì1876 in 1974. Some years later another register, dated around 1838 and painted for David and Anna Niles, appeared at auction. Other registers, for Dennis and Lois Stebbins, Oliver and Olive Wilkinson, and James and Jane Clark, are also known. All date to the mid-1830s, and all are either from Halifax or from communities nearby. The Clark register is inscribed, \\"Executed by Almira Edson, Halifax, Vt.\\" All have been ascribed to Edson based on stylistic similarities. Her last known register, for William C. and Emily Porter Russell, was painted around 1847 in Ellington, Connecticut, near Vernon. Edson's family register for the Clarks is currently owned by the New- York Historical Society.https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/james-and-jane- clark-tucker-family-register The Stebbins family register is held by Historic Deerfield in its collections.

She was the daughter of Richard and Ruth Miner Goldsmith, former residents of Guilford, Connecticut who moved to Brookfield, New York sometime between 1805 and 1808. Little is known of her life, or of her motivations for becoming an artist, although it is suspected that she was forced into the profession due to economic necessity. No advertisements survive documenting her travels; however, her own records indicate that she was active in the New York communities of Brookfield, North Brookfield, Hamilton, Lebanon, Cooperstown, Hartwick, Toddsville, and Hubbardsville between 1826 and 1832. In the latter year she married George Addison Throop, a member of a family for whom she had produced work; their marriage followed a correspondence in which she expressed concerns about their differing religions (she was a Baptist, he a Universalist), her age (greater by two years), and the fact that some of her teeth were false. The couple had two children before her death, following an illness of several weeks' duration. She is buried in Brookfield's Cole Hill Cemetery. ==Works== Only a handful of works by Goldsmith have been identified, most of them watercolors either on paper or on ivory, although she is known to have produced pictures in oil as well. She produced numerous portraits as well as commonplace books, the latter filled with decorative images, illustrated copies of prints, and a mourning picture in addition to poetry and other writings. She also left behind her worktable and a tin paint box. An 1832 portrait of Permilia Forbes Sweet by Goldsmith is owned by the Fenimore Art Museum, while her portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Lyman Day and their daughter Cornelia, dated c. 1823‚Äì1824, is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum.

It was originally proposed by Achim Hager and Robert Cleland in 1971, in the form of ‚Äúacid-growth hypothesis‚Äù. They hypothesized that the naturally occurring plant hormone, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA), induces H+ proton extrusion into the apoplast. Such derived apoplectic acidification then activates a range of enzymatic reactions which modifies the extensibility of plant cell walls. Since its formulation in 1971, many debates about ‚Äúacid-growth‚Äù began. Most of these debates hovered around the signalling role of auxin and the molecular nature of cell wall modification. Many scientists contributed to the theory's development. With continual improvements on technology, these advancements provided new insight for this molecular mechanism, especially auxin‚Äôs role in the apoplectic pH shift. Despite the ongoing controversy and debate that rose from new discoveries, the importance of the acid-growth theory in plant cells‚Äô growth and elongation should not be set aside. == History and development of the theory == === Early development === ==== Emergence of theory ==== Auxin was known to be a growth stimulant, but it wasn't until the year 1971, that Hager and Cleland proposed the \\"acid-growth hypothesis\\", which primarily suggested the correlation between auxin and apoplast acidification. The hypothesis states that susceptible coleoptile cells expel H+ protons through membrane-bound proton pumps into the apoplast (space between plant cell wall and cytoplasm) at an accelerated pace, causing a decrease in the apoplastic pH value. The following precise natural mechanism of the wall-loosening process; however, remained unknown at the time. With reference to auxin-induced elongation regarded as \\"acid-growth\\", Hager based his experiment on plasmolyzed hypocotyls from sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Subsequently, his wall-acidification model initiated continual controversy among scientists, and act as the blueprint for further re-examination. By 1900s, four core pieces of qualitative evidences solidified the core concept of the theory, as summarized below: # In auxin-treated coleoptile and stem (hypocotyl) sections, auxin induces proton extrusion into the apoplast, which could decrease the pH value by as much as one full unit. # Infiltration of neutral buffer (pH~7) into the apoplast could inhibit auxin-induced elongation and growth. # Acidic buffers of pH 5.0 could accelerate cell elongation at the same or even greater rate in comparison to that induced by auxin. #Fusiococcin (Fc) could also induce rapid cell elongation and growth, despite its primary role in promoting extensive acidification of the apoplast. ==== Constraints and interpretation ==== Within the 20-year timespan, many scientists have actively contributed to examining and reevaluating the \\"acid-growth hypothesis\\" proposed by Achim Hager. Despite the accumulation of observations that evidently identify the final target of the auxin-induced action to be H+-ATPase, which excretes H+ protons to the apoplast and take in K+ ions through its rectifying K+ channel in the following years, the controversy has been carried over till today as an ongoing debate. === Ongoing development === ==== Discovery of hydrolytic enzyme ==== With H+ protons being excreted to the apoplast as one of the wall- loosening factors (WLF), scientists believed that the mechanism involves activation of hydrolytic enzymes through possible hydrolysis of bonds. Back in the year 1971, Hager anticipated the possible existence of enzymes from his experiment which involves heat-killing and denaturation of enzyme inhibitors. However, it wasn't until 1992 when Simon McQueen-Mason and his collaborators discovered the most pH-responsive substance in the apoplast- expansin. Expansin is a pH-dependent hormone that could cause irreversible wall extension and wall stress relaxation without displaying any enzymatic activity. It is activated after detecting the acidification in cell wall solution, consequently breaking down hydrogen bonds or covalent bonds in the cell wall to allow xyloglucan slipping- a mechanism that allows microfibrils to slip into the cell wall matrix without extension. Meanwhile, it could also loosen the cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall to enable the cell to take in more water and expand via turgor and osmosis. ==== Transcriptional control ==== Transcriptional modification is crucial in the growth and development of cells When a plant is treated with auxin treatment, auxin- induced transcriptional changes occurs within minutes, which indicates that both transcription and translation is necessary for auxin-induced growth. One of the major mechanisms for auxin control in plant is the transport inhibitor response through singling from F-box (regulatory protein) When auxin level raise to a certain concentration, auxin will interact with F-Box protein and stimulate the auxin transcriptional repressors. This leads to degradation of auxin protein. Nevertheless, transcriptional response does not only regulate auxin itself but also mediate the gene expression for protein encoded for cell-wall modification (cell wall-remodelling agents). It was found that when treated plant with exogenous auxin, the expression of pectin methylesterases, expansins and other protein that changes cell wall's shape and size. == Modern interpretation == This \\"acid-growth\\" model integrate the historical data with new research and discoveries, but far from done and dusted. The decrease in apoplast pH value leads to cell wall modification, as the increased extensibility of cell wall results in cell growth. The altercation in apoplastic pH is mediated by auxin-induced mechanisms. With auxin acting as the primary signalling tool, it initiates apoplastic acidification via two mechanisms. Auxin could disrupt the cell wall's composition directly by increasing the gene transcription of wall-modifying agents. Meanwhile, it could impact the rate of acidification indirectly by reducing the H+-ATPase activity, which decreases the number of H+ protons into the apoplast. This model is well illustrated by previous research studies, but the kinetics of auxin transcriptional response requires further examination. == Unsolved questions == There are several aspects of the theory that remain contentious. These include: # Measurement of pH value: Despite optimal high-sensitivity detection brought by the implementation of fluorescent pH sensors, there is a lack of reliable method in quantifying the absolute apoplast pH value in plants. For instance, scientists made use of whole-organ resolution as part of their apoplastic pH measurement. However, such research methods on the cellular level wouldn't establish equivalent validity at the quantitative level due to the plausible leaking of the signal from the endomembrane system into those originating from the apoplast. # Limitations on particular plant organs: Most of the research has been limited to the aerial organs of plants. Instead of studying the growth-promoting effect that auxin brings to the aerial organs, David Pacheco Villalobos discovers the inhibitory effect auxin has on root elongation. # Narrow coverage of plant species: Data that supported the early development of the theory initially originated from coleoptiles, epicotyls, and hypocotyls of a wide range of monocot and dicot species. To note, it all began with observations from sunflower. The importance to expand the research territory beyond angiosperm species to more ancient members within the plant family tree is undeniable. Latter observations on different plant species could help identify conserved hormones and genes, or underlying mechanisms that support the theory, with the confirmation of SAUR19's role in auxin-induced hypocotyl elongation in tomatoes being one of the more recent discoveries. == See also == *Plant hormones *Plant development * Plant cell * Meristem ==Reference== Category:Auxins ","title":"Acid-growth hypothesis"},{"id":"60298324","text":"The San Jose municipal elections of 2010 were held on Sunday December 5 to elect the mayor, deputy mayors, syndics and district councilors of the central canton of San Jos√©, capital of Costa Rica.

The southernmost of these begins at the northern terminus of the Sanriku Expressway in Miyako. It passes through the town Iwaizumi and then enters the village Tanohata where it comes to a temporary end at the parallel Route 45. Further north the expressway has another section, entirely within Tanohata, measuring just over four kilometers long. Continuing north along Route 45 the expressway begins again in the village, Fudai. Like the previous section, it is located entirely within the limits of the village, measuring just over four kilometers long before it rejoins the parallel Route 45. The northern terminus of the route when it is to be completed is located at an interchange with Japan National Route 395 in Kuji that presently only serves the Hachinohe-Kuji Expressway. ==Future== The expressway is expected to be completed between Tanohata and Fudai by 2020 as part of a region-wide recovery effort from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. ==Junction list== The entire expressway is in Iwate Prefecture. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * *Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport: Tohoku Regional Development Bureau Category:Expressways in Japan Category:Regional High-Standard Highways in Japan Category:Roads in Iwate Prefecture Category:Proposed roads in Japan Category:2006 establishments in Japan ","title":"Sanriku-kita J≈´kan Road"},{"id":"60298539","text":"The 22671/22672 Chennai Egmore - Madurai Junction Tejas Express is India's second semi-high speed Tejas Express introduced by Indian Railways connecting and in Tamilnadu, after Mumbai CSMT - Karmali Tejas Express.

The Mississippi River also saw flooding, although starting later and ending earlier. The 2019 January-to-May period was the wettest on record for the U.S., with multiple severe weather outbreaks through May in the Midwest, High Plains, and South exacerbating the flooding and causing additional damage. Throughout late May and early June, rain in Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri caused every site on the Mississippi River to record a top-five crest. At least three people in Iowa and Nebraska died. Nearly 14 million people in the midwestern and southern states were affected by the flooding, which the New York Times called \\"The Great Flood of 2019\\". New record river levels were set in 42 different locations. Although $12 billion in aid was made \\"available to farmers who lost money due to the trade war\\" the previous year, Reuters reported that the USDA had \\"no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored-crop losses from the widespread flooding.\\" At least 1 million acres of U.S. farmland, in nine major grain producing states flooded. On September 17, 2019, a third round of flooding along the Missouri River was considered likely, due to heavy rains of up to \\"four times what is normal in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota and Nebraska.\\" On October 28, 2019, it was predicted that the prolonged Missouri River flooding, which lasted as long as seven months in some locations, could continue all winter, with no end in sight. On December 16, 2019, the prolonged Missouri River flooding in the Kansas City district was declared officially over. == Causes == Capitol South Metro with sign about Missouri River flooding From January until early March, average temperatures in the Midwest remained in the low 20 to 30 average degree Fahrenheit range, with record snowfall in many areas, including the early March blizzard, up to three feet on the ground in some areas. In Nebraska, over the course of three days (March 11 ‚Äì 13), temperatures rose to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, combined with 1.5 inches of rain. This quickly melted the snow, and the frozen ground was not able to absorb any meaningful amount, which led to unprecedented runoff into local streams and rivers. Saturated soils, combined with elevated river flow from the previous fall, led to severe, widespread flooding across the middle of the United States. Many of the rivers were still frozen over with a thick layer of ice, which the powerful flow of water broke up and dislodged, creating massive chunks of ice that traveled downstream, acting like a plow. As of September 17, 2019, a third round of flooding along the Missouri River was considered likely, due to heavy rains of up to \\"four times what is normal in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota and Nebraska.\\" ==Damage== ===Illinois=== Illinois was affected by the flooding, and the Illinois National Guard was activated to assist with the efforts along the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. The Illinois National Guard was released from flood fighting duties on July 29, 2019. The river crest in Grafton, Illinois was the fourth highest ever recorded. Cairo, Illinois experienced over 156 days with waters above flood stage. In March, record flooding occurred on segments of the Rock and Pecatonica Rivers, and minor to moderate flooding occurred on the Fox, Des Plaines, Kankakee and Illinois Rivers. The Pecatonica River, which has flooded seven times since May 2017, flooded again in October, along with other Chicago area rivers including the Fox River and the Rock River. Freeport, Illinois is seeking funding to buy out flood-prone homes. ===Iowa=== Iowa was also affected by heavy rains and flooding. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed an emergency disaster proclamation March 14. One man was killed in Iowa. Parts of all nine state parks were closed. Standing water from the spring floods was still present near Iowa roads in mid September. Governor Reynolds estimated the damage at $1.6 billion, a state record. Reynolds asked the president to declare a disaster in 67 counties. A website was established, 2019 Iowa Floods, to help residents apply for assistance, report hazards, check on levee and road status, and access areas with closed roads. ==== Western Iowa ==== Western Iowa suffered severe impacts, especially in the Missouri River Valley south of Council Bluffs, Iowa. There, at least 30 levee failures flooded towns and highways. In Hamburg, two-thirds of the town was underwater when the bomb cyclone hit. The town lost sewage and gas services, according to city officials. The town's levee, which was in need of repair, was breached. Residents had been unable to raise the $5 million for necessary repairs before the storm, despite releasing a 2012 flash mob YouTube video of residents dancing \\"on Main Street, singing \\"Levee. Levee. Save us from the river.\\" to the tune of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Proud Mary.\\" Floodwaters damaged the water treatment plant in Glenwood. On April 5, the city of Glenwood was still \\"trucking in more than 6,000-gallon tanks of water to provide the roughly 275,000 gallons its residents ... [were] using each day.\\" On April 11, hundreds of homes in Fremont County were still evacuated, and road closures remained in place. Satellite images from the Weather Channel showed the town of Bartlett almost completely underwater. Fremont County farmers lost an estimated \\"390,000 bushels of stored soybeans and about 1.2 million bushels of stored corn.\\" One homeowner in McPaul, Iowa had to wait 180 days for floodwater to drain; the home flooded again five days later. The McPaul exit off of Interstate 29 was still closed in early October, and standing water was visible. 43% of flooded homeowners in Pacific Junction, other parts of rural Mills County, and Hamburg expressed interest in federal buyouts, which have a partial funding match from the Iowa Flood Mitigation Board. ==== Eastern Iowa ==== In Eastern Iowa, the Quad Cities spent 96 days with the Mississippi above flood stage levels. In Burlington, Iowa, the Mississippi rose above its banks for more than 104 days, surpassing its 1993 record. The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative (MRCTI) estimated over 2 billion dollars in flood damage. ==== Road closures ==== Interstate 29 was closed in March, and again in May, from Council Bluffs to the Missouri state border and from there to St. Joseph, Missouri, with portions of the interstate under of water. On September 20, sections of Interstate-680 and Interstate 29 were once again closed due to Missouri River flooding. Some of the standing water by Iowa roads had been there since the spring floods. ===Missouri=== Picture taken in Rocheport, MO during the flood of 2019.The entire community of Craig, Missouri, as well as parts of St. Joseph, Missouri were evacuated, and portions of Interstate 29 were under of water. On March 21, a state of emergency was issued by Governor Mike Parson, who said: In Holt County, Missouri, about 30,000 acres (12,140 hectares) of the 95,000 acres (38,445 hectares) that flooded in spring 2019 were still underwater in late October, leading to concerns of the floodwater freezing during the winter. Corning, Missouri had flooded more than once by November. ===Nebraska=== Aerial view of Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, flooded On March 14, 2019, the Spencer Dam on the Niobrara River collapsed, releasing an eleven-foot wall of water. The unrestrained flooding which followed destroyed 3 bridges downstream, including the Highway 281 bridge. In east central Nebraska, residents along the flooded Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn Rivers were forced to evacuate as some locals experienced all-time record flooding. The city of Norfolk, Nebraska evacuated a third of its residents. The Platte and Elkhorn Rivers had overflowed their levees in the greater Omaha, Nebraska region and some communities were put under a mandatory evacuation order. The Platte River at numerous sites had reached flooding of \\"historical proportions\\" with some sites breaking all-time record flood levels by as much as . By March 15, access to the city of Fremont was blocked due to all roads being closed in and out of the city. This remained the case days later with national guard military convoys being set up to get food and other supplies into the city. Offutt Air Force Base had extensive flooding from the Platte River, inundating 30 buildings and of their only runway. The base received damage that was said to \\"not be repaired for months\\", which caused some events to be moved back. Camp Ashland, one of the Nebraska National Guard‚Äôs main training sites, was also extensively damaged, with 51 of 62 buildings affected. Military representatives stated that the flooding is the worst that the camp has seen in its history, including a serious flood from 2015 that cost 3.7 million in repairs. It took several months to clean and repair the facility to support scaled back operations, with more extensive rebuilding efforts ongoing for the next several years. Thirty of the one hundred homes in Lynch, Nebraska were destroyed by the flood. On March 18, Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts declared a state of emergency and stated that the floods caused \\"[t]he most extensive damage our state has ever experienced.\\" Flood damage in Nebraska has been estimated at over $1.3 billion, including \\"$449 million in damage to roads, levees and other infrastructure.\\" Twenty seven bridges were damaged. Agricultural damages included \\"$440 million in crop losses; and $400 million in cattle losses.\\" Livestock losses included seven hundred hogs that were drowned on a farm near Fremont. Volunteers from Ohio‚Äôs Rural America Relief mounted a 10 truck convoy to North Bend, Nebraska with supplies for farm cleanup, \\"including four Gators to access the saturated fields.\\" After the 2011 Missouri River Flood, \\"it took years for some affected fields to be cleaned of debris and sand,\\" according to a Nebraska DOT official.\\" Nebraska agronomists stress the importance of choosing appropriate cover crops for flooded fields which can not be replanted. The University of Nebraska announced Flood Recovery Serviceships with the Nebraska Disaster Recovery Service Corps, sending 24 students to affected communities. === North Dakota === Widespread spring flooding \\"damaged homes, public infrastructure, hundreds of roads and thousands of acres of farmland in 19 counties in western, south central and eastern North Dakota,\\" and resulted in $16.6 million in federal funds and state loans. On October 21, 2019, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum declared a statewide flood emergency, as \\"unprecedented fall flooding\\" and rising river levels threatened the harvest. North Dakota Agricultural Commissioner Doug Goehring said, \\"We probably have in western Minnesota and North Dakota about two billion dollars worth of soybeans that are sitting in water or at least in conditions which may not allow producers to get out there and get them anytime soon.\\" === South Dakota === In March 2019, a powerful blizzard dumped up to two feet of snow in South Dakota, followed by rapidly warming temperatures that left flooding in its wake. Some residents of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation were stranded for days, and about 8,000 people lost drinking water. High water on the Moreau River prompted evacuations on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Pennington County approved a local disaster declaration as a result of a bridge collapse and other damage. In September 2019, \\"heavy rains dumped more than four times what is normal in parts of Montana, North and South Dakota and Nebraska.\\" Between September 12‚Äì15, 2019, the Big Sioux River overflowed its banks. Three blocks of Dell Rapids, South Dakota were flooded, and up to a dozen homes damaged. Bridges were washed out in Mitchell, which received 7 inches of rain in one night. Interstate 90 was shut down between Mitchell and Sioux Falls. Baltic, South Dakota was only accessible via Highway 115. Non-residents were urged to avoid Dell Rapids, Baltic, and Renner until the floods cleared. In Madison, \\"about 30 people had to be rescued by boats and heavy equipment,\\" after nine inches of rain fell in just two days.

They're caught by a security guard, but manage to keep him quiet by letting him play Nixon in the scene. The next day, BoJack learns that Kelsey has been fired for what they did. Having filmed the Christmas scene, BoJack returns home, where he finds Diane, who asks if she can stay at his place. ==Reception== The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Caroline Framke, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+. She praised the connections made between BoJack and Diane, stating that \\"It‚Äôs been long enough since we last saw BoJack and Diane interacting as real friends, but ‚ÄúThe Shot‚Äù is a reminder of why they bonded in the first place.\\" On Decider, Kayla Cobb praised the episode for showing the true side of BoJack Horseman, stating that, \\"Though he‚Äôs the same selfish BoJack we‚Äôve always known, now he seems to be using his selfishness and power for, dare I say, better reasons.\\" ==References== ==External links== * \\"The Shot\\" on Netflix * * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Netflix original television series episodes ","title":"The Shot (BoJack Horseman)"},{"id":"60298615","text":"\\"Out to Sea\\" is the twelfth episode and season finale of the second season of American animated television series BoJack Horseman.

His youngest brother was the Austrian sculptor, . From 1751 to 1758, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where his instructors were Paul Troger, the Rector of the Academy, and , a fresco painter from Silesia. From 1769, he referred to himself as a \\"foreign\\" member of the Academy, although there are no supporting documents.

Around 1762, he moved to a home near √ñdenburg, but never became a B√ºrger (citizen) there; possibly to avoid compulsory military service. During this time, he married Anna Franz and they had nine children together. After her death in 1790, he married Katharina Gillig. he worked mainly in what is now Western Hungary. His primary customers were the Bishops of Steinamanger and F√ºnfkirchen, as well the region's numerous monasteries. He also had some clientele among the nobility. Many of the secular buildings he decorated have since been destroyed or demolished. Surviving examples include the hall in , the decorations at the Hegyfalu castles near Kotenburg an der Raab and the municipal theater in √ñdenburg. About fifty portraits are known to be his. His three eldest sons assisted in his workshop. The eldest of them, Stephan Joseph Dorfmeister the Younger (1764-1807) helped with projects in Sankt Gotthard. Many works created after 1797 were jointly signed. His next eldest, Joseph Paul Stephan Dorfmeister (born 1770), remained with him in his workshop and completed his last commission; the altarpiece at the church in Magotsch (1798).

Two years later she was deputy voyage leader for an expedition to the Mertz Polynya, Antarctica. In 2016 she was awarded the McKay Hammer, for her combined research achievements between 2013-2016. == Early life == Bostock was born in Perth, Australia and grew up there, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Oman, Scotland, England, and New Zealand. She went to high school in Abbotsholme School in England. == Education and early career == Bostock was awarded her PhD by the Australian National University, Australia. Her work focused on geochemical tracing of the intermediate and surface waters in the Tasman Sea and was supervised by Bradley Opdyke and John Marshall. Prior to that she completed a MSc and BSc at Jesus College, University of Cambridge, UK. Her early career was as a researcher at Geoscience Australia. For a time she also worked as the coordinator for the Australian ODP/IODP Office, coordinating the activities and developing proposals on behalf of the marine geoscience community in Australia in the transition between the end of the Ocean Drilling Program (in 2003) and joining the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The RV Tangaroa - Bostock has led or co-led several voyages by this ship into the Southern Ocean. == Science and impact == Bostock's primary research focus is on the paleoceanography and oceanography of the Southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean using sedimentology, microfossils, isotopes and geochemical tracers to understand present and past changes in ocean circulation and their influence on climate.Bostock, H.C., Hayward, B.W., Neil, H.L., Sabaa, A.T. and Scott, G.H., 2015.

The voyage that she led to the Solander Trough region, named after Daniel Solander, directly south of the south-west corner of New Zealand (Puysegur Point) was part of a sequence of voyages seeking to characterise the present and past configuration and mechanics controlling the Subtropical front which is a significant oceanographic feature found in both hemispheres but with the southern front extending more or less continually around the globe.Smith, R.O., Vennell, R., Bostock, H.C. and Williams, M.J., 2013.

Another Israeli civilian was seriously wounded in the attack. == Background == In the six months preceding the attack, several deadly attacks were carried out in Samaria by individual Palestinian terrorists who attacked Israeli civilians and soldiers, which included among others the shooting attack in the Barkan industrial zone, the shooting attack at Givat Assaf, and the attack at the Ofra junction. In order to secure the region, an IDF force from the artillery brigade was stationed in the Ariel area which was only trained for one week before being deployed to secure the Ariel area. == The attack == On Sunday morning, March 17, 2019 a Palestinian militant arrived at the Ariel junction in the West Bank and noticed the IDF soldier, Gal Keidan of the Thunder Battalion, securing the bus station at the junction. The militant stabbed him, grabbed his weapon and shot him to death. The IDF soldier whom stood next to him did not fire at the attacker, but his commander fired across the road and wounded the attacker. Rabbi Achiad Ettinger, whom was armed, approached the militant, shot him and injured him, but the militant managed to shoot back him and critically wounded him. Afterwards, the militant hijacked a vehicle that approached the junction. He drove to the Giti Avishar junction, where he shot another IDF soldier whom as a result was seriously injured. The militant then drove towards the Palestinian town of Burukin, where he abandoned the vehicle and continued escaping on foot. == Aftermath == On March 18, a day after the attack, Rabbi Achiad Ettinger, whom was head of the Oz and Emuna Yeshiva in the Neve Sha'anan neighborhood in Tel Aviv, died of his injury.https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/641943 == The perpetrator == The militant whom carried out the attack was Omar Abu Lilah, a 19 year old Palestinian from the village of Zawiya located near Ariel.

Classified as an Extramural Center of the Institute for Basic Science, it is hosted by Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. Their research focuses on exploring quantum properties of atoms and molecules on surfaces and interfaces and long-term goals of quantum sensing and quantum computation in those areas. Their dedicated building started construction in 2018 and officially opened in 2019 during the IBS Conference on Quantum Nanoscience. ==Research results== ESR-STM is one of the first STMs globally to measure electron spin resonance on single atoms. Within two years of their founding, several published outcomes indicate growing leadership in the exploding field of quantum nanoscience. For example, they reduced digital memory down to a single holmium atom on MgO substrate using a scanning tunneling microscope. At time of their publishing, commercially-available magnetic memory devices require approximately one million atoms to record the same amount of data. This storage miniaturization has additional potential to serve as the basis of quantum computing. Researchers also coupled atom's nuclear spin and its electron counterpart, which resulted in measuring the nuclear spin of single atoms of iron and titanium with an improvement of energy resolution by a fact of 10,000. This level of control could lead to a computational base unit of quantum computing. Working in collaboration with IBM Almaden, they were able to perform MRI scans on individual atoms. ==Research directions and goals== The center has stated their desire to achieve full control of quantum states of atoms and molecules on clean surfaces and near interfaces which would allow usage of high- sensitivity quantum sensors and the usage of single atoms and molecules as quantum bits for computation applications. Another goal is to create a theoretical framework on how the quantum properties of atoms and molecules change from gas to solid-state environments and their interactions with conduction electrons and understand the transition from coherent quantum to more classical systems while in solid-state environment. The research center also hosted the first international conference on quantum nanoscience in Seoul in 2019. ==Awards== * 2018: American Physical Society, Joseph F.

She later filed a lawsuit against McGowan and Meteor Productions, alleging that McGowan and Winters had lived together for five years beginning in 1926 but that he had not lived up to his promise to marry her. During the suit, she disclosed that McGowan had paid her $60 a week to write scenarios he'd direct, and that he failed to pay her. == Selected filmography == * The Oklahoma Sheriff (1930) * Near the Rainbow's End (1930) * The Canyon of Missing Men (1930) * Western Honor (1930) * The Hunted Men (1930) * The Man from Nowhere (1930) * Call of the Desert (1930) * Covered Wagon Trails (1930) * Breezy Bill (1930) * The Parting of the Trails (1930) * O'Malley Rides Alone (1930) * A Texas Cowboy (1929) * The Man from Nevada (1929) * 'Neath Western Skies (1929) * Code of the West (1929) * Pioneers of the West (1929) * The Lone Horseman (1929) * The Oklahoma Kid (1929) * The Cowboy and the Outlaw (1929) * The Invaders (1929) * Riders of the Rio Grande (1929) * The Phantom Rider (1929) * Three Live Ghosts (1929) * The Fighting Terror (1929) * The Man from Nevada (1929) * The Law of the Plains (1929) * The Last Round-up (1929) * Headin' Westward (1929) * Texas Tommy (1928) * Law of the Mounted (1928) * Manhattan Cowboy (1928) * On the Divide (1928) == References == Category:American women screenwriters Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Sally Winters"},{"id":"60299102","text":"Altenhof may refer to: * Altenhof, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a German municipality in the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte district * Altenhof, Schleswig-Holstein, a German municipality in the Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde district * Altenhof, a German village within the Schorfheide municipality in Brandenburg ","title":"Altenhof"},{"id":"60299116","text":"Salana is a Gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic genus of bacteria from the family of Beutenbergiaceae with one known species (Salana multivorans).

It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment. The season was ordered in January 2019, and was originally planned to have 22 episodes, later brought down to 20. Filming began that June, and production was shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the season with only 19 episodes. Melissa Benoist stars as Kara, with principal cast members Mehcad Brooks, Chyler Leigh, Katie McGrath, Jesse Rath, Nicole Maines, and David Harewood also returning from previous seasons. They are joined by Azie Tesfai and Andrea Brooks, who were promoted to the main cast from recurring status in the fourth season, LaMonica Garrett, who previously appeared as a guest actor in the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover and the fifth season, and new cast members Julie Gonzalo and Staz Nair. == Episodes == == Cast and characters == === Main === * Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers / Kara Zor-El / Supergirl * Mehcad Brooks as James Olsen / Guardian * Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers * Katie McGrath as Lena Luthor * Jesse Rath as Querl \\"Brainy\\" Dox / Brainiac 5 * Nicole Maines as Nia Nal / Dreamer * Azie Tesfai as Kelly Olsen * Andrea Brooks as Eve Teschmacher / Hope * Julie Gonzalo as Andrea Rojas / Acrata * Staz Nair as William Dey * LaMonica Garrett as Mar Novu / Monitor * David Harewood as J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter, Hank Henshaw === Recurring === * Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor * Phil LaMarr as Malefic J'onzz * Nick Sagar as Russell Rogers / Rip Roar * Patti Allan as Margot Morrison * Duncan Fraser as an elderly male Leviathan representative * Cara Buono as Gamemnae / Gemma Cooper * Mitch Pileggi as Rama Khan * Thomas Lennon as Mister Mxyzptlk === Guest === ==== \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" ==== == Production == === Development === On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed Supergirl for a fifth season. Jessica Queller and Robert Rovner serve as the season's showrunners. === Writing === Queller described the fifth season of Supergirl as the series' \\"Black Mirror season\\", with Rovner elaborating that \\"What we‚Äôre looking at is how technology is impacting the way people engage and giving them an escape not to engage. It seems like nowadays, everyone is kind of on their phones or not really present, and so we wanted to speak to that and kind of how it might be hard to live in the ugliness of what's going on, and how a character like Kara can try and help us overcome that.\\" Melissa Benoist, who stars as Kara Danvers / Supergirl, said the season would be \\"a fight for [Lena Luthor's] soul\\", following Lex Luthor exposing to Lena that Kara, her best friend, is Supergirl. Rovner said the rift between Kara and Lena was something the writers had been building towards for a number of years, with the fifth season serving as the \\"long-awaited payoff\\". Queller described \\"betrayal\\" as Lena's Achilles heel due to every member of the Luthor family having betrayed her in some way over the years: \\"She has to put on this protective shell, and the last person she thought would betray her was Kara, and that really hurts more deeply than any of the others\\". === Casting === Main cast members Melissa Benoist, Mehcad Brooks, Chyler Leigh, Katie McGrath, Jesse Rath, Nicole Maines and David Harewood return as Kara Danvers / Supergirl, James Olsen, Alex Danvers, Lena Luthor, Querl Dox / Brainiac 5, Nia Nal / Dreamer, and J'onn J'onzz respectively. This is Brooks' final season; his last appearance was in the episode \\"In Plain Sight\\". Azie Tesfai, who was introduced as Kelly Olsen in the fourth season, was promoted to the main cast for the fifth season, as was Andrea Brooks, who recurred as Eve Teschmacher since the second season. They are joined by new cast members Julie Gonzalo playing Andrea Rojas and Staz Nair playing William Dey, an original creation for the series. Jeremy Jordan, who starred as Winn Schott in the first three seasons and was absent during the fourth, returned as a guest star for three episodes. === Design === The season introduces a new Supergirl suit which eschews the skirt seen in the older suit in favour of a full pant. Benoist and the showrunners said giving Supergirl pants was something they discussed since the first season. Querl Dox is credited with creating a new microscopic motion-activator for the new suit that attaches to Kara's glasses and unleashes the suit when she whips off the glasses, resulting in Supergirl being fully dressed in her costume. === Filming === Filming began in late June 2019 at Vancouver. The seventeenth episode of the season marks Benoist's directorial debut. Filming was expected to last until April 14, 2020. On March 12, 2020, Warner Bros. Television shut down production on the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the series in the middle of shooting episode 20. Leigh stated she had two more days of filming on the episode. As a result, some of the material shot for episode 20 was incorporated into episode 19, rather than saving it for season six. Some new dialogue was also recorded by actors in their homes for episode 19. === Arrowverse tie-ins === In December 2018, during the end of the annual crossover \\"Elseworlds\\", a follow up crossover was announced titled \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" based on the comic book series of the same name. The crossover took place over five episodes‚Äìthree in December 2019 and two in January 2020. == Broadcast == The season began airing in the United States on The CW on October 6, 2019. It was originally set to run for 22 episodes, later brought down to 20. As production on episode 20 could not be completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 19th episode served as the season finale. == Reception == === Ratings === === Critical response === On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an approval rating of 92% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 7.62/10. == Notes == == References == Category:2019 American television seasons Category:2020 American television seasons Category:Supergirl (TV series) seasons Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Television series set in 2020 ","title":"Supergirl (season 5)"},{"id":"60299220","text":"National Highway 327C, commonly referred to as NH 327C is a national highway in India.

In this capacity, he played an important part in the first successful British kidney transplant which was successfully carried out by a team led by Professor Woodruff in 1960. Ross removed the donor kidney which was transplanted into the recipient, the donor's twin brother, by Woodruff. In 1961 he was invited to set up a new general surgical unit at the Eastern General Hospital, Edinburgh and the success of this unit was largely due to his energy and leadership. As Honorary Consultant Surgeon to the Army in Scotland from 1970-1976 and the surgical unit at the Eastern General was selected by the RAMC for the training of its surgical specialists. A succession of army surgeons were seconded for periods of one year under his tutelage. Ross always had a special interest in the surgical subspecialty of urology. He collaborated with Sir John Bruce and Professor Robert Walmsley in writing the textbook Manual of Surgical Anatomy. == College activities == After his election as a Fellow, Ross became closely involved in the activities of the RCSEd. He became Secretary in 1960 and in his eight years in office he acquired a valuable knowledge of College history, traditions and laws. He was elected Vice President in 1971 and President in 1973. Ross was largely responsible for the establishment of the College's triennial overseas meetings and was a prime mover in the reform of higher surgical examinations together with the orthopaedic surgeon Professor JIP James and the neurosurgeon John Gillingham. The early proposals were refined under his successors and ultimately resulted in the institution of higher intercollegiate examinations in the surgical specialties. Obituary. James Ross. The Scotsman 1 May 1997 When his Presidential term ended in 1976 he took on the Chairmanship of the RCSEd Appeal which raised funds for the conversion of the postgraduate residence in Hill Square, which was subsequently concerted into Ten Hill Square hotel. == Later life == His book The Edinburgh School of Surgery after Lister, published in 1978, is a valuable contribution to Scottish medical history. His historical knowledge enabled him to play an important part in the planning of the Sir Jules Thorn Historical Exhibition in Surgeons' Hall Museum. == References == Category:1911 births Category:1997 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Royal Army Medical Corps officers Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:Scottish surgeons Category:20th-century surgeons Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:University of Edinburgh Medical School alumni ","title":"James Ross (surgeon)"},{"id":"60299667","text":"Trevor Jacobs (born July 25, 1976) is an American politician who has served in the Kansas House of Representatives from the 4th district since 2017, and a rancher.

He is the founder and CEO of The Mono Company, a recording, mixing, mastering, producing and consulting company that dwells particularly on research and development about the future of audio- visual technologies. He has produced artists such as Teodor Currentzis, Brian Eno, Arca, and participated in major productions such as the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony of Baku and the DAU project, an immersive art installation in Paris. == Background == Quintard was born in Paris. Inspired by his multicultural childhood spent across the globe in Mumbai, Hong Kong and Singapour, Quintard started to learn music theory and piano at the age of 3. He pursued his musical education in different conservatories and local music schools, where he developed considerable vocal skills as well as an expertise in guitar, bass, and drums. He returned to Paris in his teenager years and started a rock band, Dot Legacy, that successfully toured around Europe, Brazil and Canada winning the Best International Emerging Artist award at the Canadian Indie Week in December 2018. Fascinated by science, specifically maths and physics, he studied aerospace engineering before turning to audio engineering. Quintard's first recordings were charity based for the National Institute for the Young and Blind (INJA) in Paris where his sister would often sing. He dived deeper into the world of sound and audio engineering and created his first professional recordings for the renowned studio Little Tribeca, where he worked as Studio Manager. During this time, he recorded and produced many award-winning productions such as Schumann, Schubert, Brahms with Lise Berthaud & Adam Laloum and Johann Adolf Hasse: Siroe, Re di Persiaith Max Emmanuel Cenƒçiƒá & George Petrou. Through several productions since 2012, he developed a friendship with the renown orchestra director Teodor Currentzis who became his mentor and inspired him to research new ways of recording and mixing. His work as Lead Sound Engineer in the European Olympic Opening Ceremony in Baku, Azerbaijan granted him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Live and Direct to Tape Sound Mixing. Captivated with the idea of breaking sonic barriers and finding new ways of mixing and producing, he founded The Mono Company in 2018. The Mono Company's main focus is to deliver reference recordings and the development of new state of the art audio- technology supported by its unique partnerships with Audio Note ( world's finest home audio equipment) and Aston Microphones. == Career == Damien Quintard started recording, mixing and mastering the rising classical star Teodor Currentzis and his orchestra musicAeterna in 2012. Throughout the years, Currentzis became a friend and a mentor who helped improve Quintard's technique and detailed work. Their collaboration resulted in a series of recognized awards, particularly for Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony and Mozart's Don Giovanni that won respectively the Gold and Silver Record Academy Award in Japan ‚Äì that being the first time in 55 iterations that the same artist wins the top two prizes consecutively. These recordings successfully won several awards, counting the Diapason d'Or (2017) and the Gramophone Classical Music Award (2018) for Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 as well as the BBC Magazine Music Award (2017) for Mozart's Don Giovanni ‚Äì amongst many others. In 2015, he worked with Dimitris Papaioannou and Vangelino Currentzis on the production of the Baku Olympic Games Opening Ceremony in Azerbaijan. The ceremony was nominated by the National Academy of Television, Arts and Sciences for an Emmy Award, granting the Sound Engineering and Production Department a golden statuette for Outstanding Live and Direct to Tape Sound Mixing. This particular production focused on the unusual blending of different genres going from Lady Gaga‚Äôs live performance and interpretation of Imagine by John Lennon to Jean Sibelius and traditional Azeri music. After meeting with Peter Qvortrup, CEO of Audio Note in 2016 in Zurich during the premiere of Verdi's Macbeth, they decided to work together on creating a revolutionary line of audio equipment. Qvortrup‚Äôs unique vision and knowledge of music was one of the most defining moments of Damien‚Äôs early career. Quintard and Qvortrup started developing these new technologies on Audio Note Music recordings with artists such as Vincent B√©langer and Edna Stern. At this date, Damien‚Äôs studio in Paris where he edits, mixes and masters all of his records is exclusively equipped with two Audio Note systems including Tomei AN-E Alnico Sogon and Meishu AN-E SPeHE. In 2018, he co-produced with Les Films Jack F√©bus as Lead Sound Engineer the broadcasting of the S√≥nar Festival in Barcelona, Spain where he recorded acts such as LCD Sound System, Laurent Garnier, Thom Yorke, Richie Hawtin and Gorillaz. During this year, he also recorded the Reworks Festival in Thessaloniki, Greece. In 2019, DAU, a project quoted to be ‚Äúthe most insane shoot of all time‚Äù by the Telegraph and ‚Äúthe most expansive, complicated, all-consuming film project ever attempted‚Äù by GQ opened its world premiere in Paris. In an overwhelming sense of scale and history, the film director Ilya Khrzhanovsky and musical producer Vangelino Currentzis along with Damien Quintard joined their minds to create an experience blending live performances and complex sound processing during 30 days and nights. The general idea was to gather an incredible database of music, adaptations, experiments and emotions throughout the whole event. For the Grand World Opening of the project happening between the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville and the Pompidou Center, Quintard was assigned as Head of Production and Performances as well as Head of the Sound and Concerts Department where he worked with and produced artists such as Teodor Currentzis, Brian Eno, Marko Nikodijevic and Arca. == Quotes == \\"You can't categorize Damien Quintard.

The film stars Arya in dual roles along with Indhuja Ravichandran and Mahima Nambiar. Kaali Venkat, Rohini, Jayaprakash, Ilavarasu, and Aruldoss play supporting roles. S. Thaman scores music for the film, and editing is handled by V. J. Sabu Joseph. Principal photography of the film commenced during November 2018. It was theatrically released by Tarun Pictures on 6 September 2019 to highly positive reviews from both critics and audience. ==Plot == The film travels back and forth between two characters. Magadevan (Arya) is a cab driver in Chennai and also works as a thug for a corrupt politician named Muthuraj (Ilavarasu). Muniraj (Arya) is a Good Samaritan and organic farmer who believes in Swami Vivekananda's teachings, thinks the world of Tamil literature, and lives in a village near Erode. It is made clear that Maga is an atheist while Muni practices yoga and spreads the word of Hinduism. Maga thinks the world of his wife Viji (Indhuja Ravichandran) and five-year-old son. He is also trying to turn a new life and leave the world of crime. Muni, on the other hand, is happy living with his loving mother (Rohini). He wants to be a \\"Nitya Brahmachari\\" (bachelor), and at the same time, impart knowledge to students. Deepa (Mahima Nambiar) is a journalism student and the daughter of a local landlord named Jayaraman (Jayaprakash), who is in awe of the soft-spoken Muni. Trouble erupts for Maga when one of Muthuraj's rivals, Guru Narayanan (Aruldoss), tries to fix him in an earlier murder case, which was planned by him for Muthuraj. Muthuraj, in order to save himself and his nephew, enters into connivance with the police and makes Maga the bad guy. At the same time, Jayaraman does not like his daughter moving around with Muni, a lower caste man, and wants to eliminate him. Jayaraman plans to kill Muni through a snakebite in his farm; however, Muni is saved and admitted in the hospital by Deepa. Meanwhile, Maga is framed for the murder of Guru Narayanan's brother Surya Narayanan (Krishnamurthy) and is wanted by the police. Maga plans to escape to Vizag with his family and lead a normal life. He requests Muthuraj to pay him his balance money so that he can start a new life without knowing that Muthuraj has betrayed Maga by disclosing his whereabouts to the police and Guru Narayanan. While Maga is on the way to meet Muthuraj, he is chased and shot by the police. Maga, despite being severely wounded, escapes the place by boarding a goods train. Policemen track Maga's location using his mobile phone signal and find that he is somewhere near Erode. Maga contacts Muthuraj again requesting for help. Muthuraj asks Maga to meet Jayaraman in Erode, who also happens to be Muthuraj's friend, so that he could get some money. In the meantime, policemen search all the hospitals around Erode, suspecting Maga to be treated for his injury. Finally, the police finds Muni in a hospital (as he was admitted for his snakebite) and arrests him, mistaking him as Maga. Meanwhile, Maga goes to Jayaraman's house seeking help. There, a drunk Jayaraman gets shocked upon seeing Maga and mistakes him as Muni, who has come for revenge. Jayaraman tries to attack Maga, but Maga kills Jayaraman to safeguard himself. Maga's friends find out the true identity of Muthuraj and inform Maga. Maga feels bad for being betrayed by Muthuraj. On the other hand, Muni is handed over to Guru Narayanan by a corrupt police inspector (G. M. Sundar). Guru Narayanan's henchmen attack Muni as a means of revenge, believing him to be Maga. Muni is critically injured and is admitted in the hospital. The police also arrests Viji and her son. Viji thinks that Maga is dead and commits suicide by jumping into a well. Maga comes to know about Muni from his friends, and he rushes to see him in the hospital. Maga understands that Muni is his twin brother. A small flashback is shown where Maga and Muni's mother (unknown person) was mentally ill, and she left the two children alone and went away. Maga and Muni are separated when they were kids. Maga was grown in an orphanage, while Muni was adopted by his mother. Maga gets furious knowing about Viji's death and decides to kill the baddies. He goes to Muthuraj's place and kills everyone including Muthuraj, the police inspector, and Guru Narayanan. As Maga was also shot by police before, he also gets admitted in the same hospital where Muni is present. Unfortunately, Muni passes away. After a few months, it is shown that Maga comes to Muni's village as he feels guilty of Muni's death and decides to follow Muni's path of literature and peace of mind. Maga's son is rescued and is raised by Muni's adoptive mother. When Maga is asked what his name is, he says, \\"Magamuni.\\" == Cast == * Arya as Magadevan and Muniraj * Indhuja Ravichandran as Viji * Mahima Nambiar as Deepa * Kaali Venkat as Dr. Raghu * Rohini as Muni's mother * Jayaprakash as Jayaraman * Ilavarasu as Muthuraj * Aruldoss as Guru Narayanan * Madhan Kumar as Aadhi Narayanan * Bala Singh as Politician * G.

While the case concerned an application for judicial review of an asylum decision, the decision was described as carrying ‚Äúimplications for the whole body of Irish administrative law‚Äù. == Background == The appellant in the case, Ms Meadows, was a Nigerian national who had sought refugee status. According to the appellant, she faced threats to her life in Nigeria and also feared being forced into an arranged marriage and being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) against her will. Ms Meadows was unsuccessful in her claim of refugee status and subsequently the Refugee Appeals Tribunal found that Ms Meadows was not a refugee within the meaning of section 2 the Refugee Act 1996 as amended, affirming the prior decision.Meadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2010] 2 IR 701 (SC) 761. While the Tribunal accepted that FGM constituted torture, the Tribunal found that the appellant had not ‚Äúestablished a credible connection between her circumstances, on the one hand, and forced marriage and FGM on the other‚Äù.Meadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2010] 2 IR 701 (SC) 712. In response to a letter from the Minister for Justice giving notice of a proposed deportation order, counsel for the appellant made representations to the Minister, arguing that her removal would contravene Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The letter emphasised the request to be permitted to submit expert evidence on Nigeria that outlined the likelihood of subjection to FGM. The Minister's letter had confined itself to stating that he was satisfied that the provisions of section 5 (prohibition of refoulement) of the Refugee Act 1996 had been complied with. Without communicating further with the appellant or her legal representatives, the Minister made a formal deportation order. The appellant sought judicial review of the deportation decision in the High Court. In order to be granted judicial review of the decision, ‚Äúsubstantial grounds‚Äù would have to be established.Meadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2010] 2 IR 701 (SC) 709. There was ‚Äúa point of contention‚Äù as regards the appropriate means by which grounds for review could be assessed. While some judges had considered applications for leave to challenge administrative decisions under the standard of ‚Äúanxious scrutiny‚Äù, other judges had applied the standard of unreasonableness as laid down in O'Keeffe v An Bord Plean√°la [1993] 1 IR 3. The High Court refused Ms Meadow's application for leave, but certified a point of law to the Supreme Court. The question was put: ‚ÄúIn determining the reasonableness of an administrative decision which affects or concerns constitutional rights or fundamental rights, is it correct to apply the standard as set out in O'Keeffe v An Bord Plean√°la?‚ÄùMeadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2003] IEHC 79. == Supreme Court == The question certified to the Supreme Court was much broader than Ms Meadow's application for leave. The decision would have relevance ‚Äúto all administrative decisions, not just those in the field of immigration and asylum, and all constitutional or fundamental rights, not just those which might have been implicated in the instant case‚Äù. The decision of the Supreme Court was reached in a three to two majority decision, with the majority of the Court rejecting the ‚Äúanxious scrutiny‚Äù standard and finding that proportionality was relevant to the assessment of reasonableness of administrative decisions affecting fundamental rights. Following an assessment of the standards of review of administrative decisions in Ireland, Denham J asserted that where ‚Äúfundamental rights are in issue, such rights form part of the constitutional jurisdiction of the court in which a reasonable decision is required to be made and, if made, analysed‚Äù.Meadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2010] 2 IR 701 (SC) 744. In considering the facts of Ms Meadow's appeal, Fennelly J referred to the absence of a reference in the decision of the Minister to relevant material concerning the prevalence of FGM in Nigeria.Meadows v Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform [2010] 2 IR 701 (SC) 830. According to Fennelly J, ‚Äúthe difficulty posed by the form of the Minister‚Äôs decision is not merely his failure to provide reason for his decision, though that is undoubtedly the case, but that the decision is defective as a result‚Äù. ==References== Category:Supreme Court of Ireland cases Category:2010 in Irish law Category:Irish constitutional law Category:2010 in case law ","title":"Meadows v.

Lal made a cameo apperarance. It was released on 22 February 2019. The film is getting ready for a release in China. ==Plot== Fr. Vincent Kombana (Amith Chakalakkal) is a roguish and a kindhearted priest of Kombana family, famous in his village. He was trained by his father Issac Kombana (Lal) to become a police officer first. Vincent grew up to be a police officer, fulfilling his dream, but when things got really complicated, Vincent became a priest. All the people in the village are fond of Vincent and fear him very much. He gets information from his peon Kunjoyi (Shammi Thilakan) regarding all sorts of legal and illegal businesses and once anyone gets caught, he receives a huge punishment. His another subordinates were Kurukkan Ponnappan (Nedumudi Venu) and Member Rocky (Nandhu). One midnight as Vincent was walking through field, he hears a cry of a person to find out that it was a murder done by Kattuthara Joy (Dileesh Pothan). He saw the whole incident where Joy asks his companion to put the body of the dead person into a ditch after digging it. Vincent as a witness to this murder decided to expose this in front of the society. However, he couldn't do it as Joy confessed about the murder to Vincent. But Joy did not tell him whom he killed. As a priest couldn't tell any confessions out, Joy utilized his opportunity to frame the murder onto someone else. Even though Vincent had hidden in behind the bushes, Joy saw him. Vincent understood that Joy hadn't actually confessed sincerely. It was his only way to trap Vincent in order to escape from the case. Vincent, day by day continued his strong prayers for a solution. Kunjoyi then comes and informs Vincent about the death of Lissy (Lena), Joy's beloved wife. The next day her funeral goes with further songs and sorrow. However before taking any decision, Vincent was eager to know who was murdered in the ditch. So as to get an idea, he went to the same place when the body was hidden. He began digging to find whose the body was. Vincent came across many burdens including the enquiry of Salamma (Anjali Nair) for her brother who had been missing for many days after he went to Pollachi. Vincent decides to give the land to Kunjoyi in order to get rid of digging the plot where the body had been dug. After all the agreements, people finds out the body and Kunjoyi informs about this to Vincent. He immediately reaches the spot. It is found whose the body was. It was Eldhose (Mejo Joseph) who was killed by Joy. The police informs Vincent that it was a murder as they found many spots of stabs. Vincent tells Joy that he will prove this case with the help of someone else. Joy shows Vincent a video. The video shows Vincent digging the ditch which was taken by Joy without the knowledge of Vincent. If Joy shows this publicly, then it is sure that Vincent will be blamed. Vincent requested Joy to delete the video. Joy said that if Vincent does the flag hoisting, then Joy will confront the clapping hands. Vincent then thinks of another way to imprison Joy and finally starts his prayer keeping all his secrets in mind. Meanwhile Santo (Murugan), Joy's friend overheard his prayers and his plans to rescue Santo as he too would be killed by Joy. Vincent then asked the reason behind murder of Eldhose as Santo was present beside Joy and helped him bury Eldhose's body in the ditch. Then a flashback shows, as Eldhose was returning from Pollachi he met Joy only to find him furious. Joy came to know from his wife Lissy that her daughter's actual father was Eldhose. As Eldhose stood disappointed Joy said, \\"My confidence is getting hindered by your existence.\\" and stabs him multiple times to kill him. Back to the present, Vincent and his policemen managed to lock Santo as a witness to the murder committed by Joy. Later Vincent moves to Joy to enquire about Lissy's death and already knew that it was Joy who killed her by poisoning her. ==Cast== *Amith Chakalakkal - Fr.

The stadium has a current capacity of 4,081 spectators. ==History== The old stadium, H√∏ddvoll Stadion, did not meet the criteria for First Division stadia, lacking such amenities as under-soil heating, floodlights and the necessary standard for locker rooms. The club is therefore working on plans to build an all-new stadium at the site of the training pitch‚Äîthe site of the first stadium from 1921. The new venue will feature a main stand on the north long side and artificial turf. The project is estimated to cost NOK 50 million. The main stand will feature 1,950 seated places, the opposite, south stand will feature 875 seated places, and the eastern stand will feature standing places for 1,000 spectators, for a total of 3,825. The west end will be built as part of H√∏ddvoll Panorama, which combines commercial estate in the ground floor and eighteen apartments in the upper two stories. The new venue is certified for Eliteserien and UEFA matches. H√∏dd will rent the stadium from the municipality for NOK 2.5 million per year. The main stand will be built in conjunction with Ulsteinhallen, and will feature common locker rooms and cafeteria. The indoor arena will feature a hall area for recreational athletics, handball and gymnastics, with Dimna IL as the main tenant. Both Ulsteinhallen and the new stadium will be owned by Ulstein Eigedomsselskap KF, a municipal enterprise owned by Ulstein Municipality. The municipality estimates that the hall will cost between one and a half and two million kroner per year to operate. M√∏re og Romsdal County Municipality secured 47.6 percent of the investment costs and 37.6 percent of the operating costs of the new hall, to allow it to be used by Ulstein Upper Secondary School. This will give the school access to of new floor space and daytime access to the athletics hall. Construction commenced in December 2012, with Nord-Berg as the main contractor. The arena's scheduled completion was in 2014, when it would become the third-largest indoor athletics arena in Norway, costing a total of NOK 123 million.

The remainder of the play reveals the dreams of each soldier and their attitude to life and death. ==Background== Commissioned as part of the Festival of Britain, the anti-war drama, directed by Michael Macowan, opened at St. Thomas' church in Regent Street, London, in May 1951. It then toured churches around Britain with its cast of Stanley Baker, Denholm Elliott, Hugh Pryse and Leonard White. It was also performed in churches in America later the same year. ==Critical reception== T.C.

Half of her face was skinned to the skull and her body had multiple stab wounds. She was also naked from the waist down and possibly raped. == Murder == Before her murder, it was reported that 16-year-old student Christine Silawan's unidentified boyfriend supposedly used a fake Facebook account to lure her into meeting him. Investigators discovered that the suspect had posed as another man on Facebook, trying to \\"court\\" her. On March 11, 2019, Silawan was found dead in a vacant lot in Lapu-Lapu City with multiple stab wounds and her face was mutilated. An autopsy also revealed that her tongue, trachea, esophagus, parts of her neck, and her right ear were missing. == Investigation and aftermath == Jonas Martel Bueno, who was arrested for the murder of a 62-year-old farmer in Danao City, Cebu, denied involvement in Silawan's murder. Police said that the style of the killings in Danao City were \\"strikingly similar\\" to that of Silawan's. The murder suspect, identified as 'John', was arrested at his home in Barangay Maribago, Lapu-Lapu City on March 16, 2019, based on conversation exchanged on Facebook Messenger. According to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), if Silawan's ex-boyfriend known only as John killed her, he could be charged in court. John passed the discernment procedure conducted on him. Forensic investigation stated that Silawan was murdered sometime between 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm on March 10, 2019. March 10 CCTV footage shows Silawan walking with a man in the early evening; this was the last known footage of her. The authorities said that Silawan broke up with John a few days before her murder, adding that they are looking at jealousy as the possible motive. The Philippine National Police (PNP) earlier said that at least three persons could have committed the murder. However, the allegations against the suspect were baseless according to the suspect's relative, who claimed that the he was playing basketball with his friends and doing household chores on the day of her murder. The suspect's mother believed that her son was innocent and instead called for the real perpetrator. The suspect's mother added that her son would have been on the run if he had committed the murder. The suspect himself opened the door for the NBI, who filed the search warrant on him. According to the NBI, they based their suspicions on eyewitness testimony. CCTV footage showed the victim walking hurriedly away from the church being followed by the man at 6:12 pm ‚Äî contrary to the mother's claim that he was playing basketball. According to the teenager's friend, who was selling food near the basketball court, he bought a balut around 7:00 pm or 8:00 pm and then went home. The NBI reviewed Facebook Messenger exchanges between the suspect and Silawan where they found some deleted messages. They were also looking for evidence of the suspect's usage of a fake account to lure the victim into meeting her on March 10. The suspect underwent a drug test, which was negative. According to the NBI, the suspect is a former lover of Silawan and he was charged with murder; however the suspect did not admit to the crime. Silawan's mother, Lourdes Silawan, is convinced that the suspect and other cohorts committed the crime. The PNP declared the case as \\"closed\\" on March 19, but the police will continue to search for two other suspects. The suspect is now in DSWD custody. The killing has elicited controversy and political debate over the proposed reinstatement of the death penalty as a punishment for heinous crimes. The Public Attorney's Office forensic team confirmed on April 2, 2019 that Silawan was raped. The team found bleeding in her genitals; they also discovered that acid was possibly poured onto the victim's face before being peeled off. It was discovered that the victim was strangled to death using a rope, and the forensic team suspected that at least three people may have been involved. == See also == * Black Dahlia, whose body was found mutilated == References == Category:2019 crimes in the Philippines Category:Deaths by person in Asia Category:History of Cebu ","title":"Murder of Christine Silawan"},{"id":"60300160","text":"National Highway 124D, commonly referred to as NH 124D is a national highway in India.

SGIS became part of 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment in 2019, before moving to the recently re-reformed 13 Signal Regiment in July 2020. ==Role== As an outcome of the UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) of 2010, the Future Reserves 2020 (FR20) consultation paper Delivering the Nation‚Äôs Security Together, published in late 2012 explained how the Army Reserve needed to almost double in size to a trained strength of 30,000. Particular emphasis was placed upon the requirement for many more specialists, i.e. reservists who are recruited primarily for their professional expertise and skills which are in short supply in the Regular Army. 254 (SGIS) Signal Squadron provides consultancy- style expertise in relation to both Information Management and Information Exploitation in support of the Army and UK Defence as a whole, with their increasing reliance on technology. ==Training, development and capability delivery== The unit typically assembles six or seven times each year for military training, unit development, educational and multi-stream capability delivery purposes. In addition, it undertakes a multitude of tasks for a range of customers, from as little as a day in duration to many months. All individuals are required to pass military annual training tests, be proficient in basic close combat skills, develop an awareness of the wider army and its Land environment client base, gain an understanding of Royal Corps of Signals and army culture and be able to work in small teams. All individuals complete a minimum of 19 days of training per year, which should include military training and the execution of tasks for clients. ==Recruitment== The unit comprises mainstream Reserve officers, specialist officers, warrant officers (WOs) and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). They recruit specialists directly from the commercial IT industry, but also many ex-regular soldiers plus those already serving in the UK Army Reserve who have the right skills. The unit rank range is lance corporal to WO1, then captain to lieutenant colonel. Typically they will recruit individuals with experience in either information assurance (IA) or information and communications services (ICS), skills which are in short supply in the regular army. == References == ==External links== *254 (SGIS) Signal Squadron *15th Signal Regiment (Information Support) Category:Squadrons of the Royal Corps of Signals Category:United Kingdom military unit and formation stubs Category:Information technology consulting firms of the United Kingdom Category:Army Reserve (United Kingdom) ","title":"Specialist Group Information Services"},{"id":"60300302","text":"John Creighton is a British archaeologist and assistant professor at the University of Reading.

In his artworks he addresses topics like wealthiness, sex and religion, often using recognisable symbols and logos, and describes a modern world where brands and celebrities are the new Gods to worship. Endless‚Äô first foray into the art world was over a decade ago through creating bold street art across London. His first major opportunity came from Ed Burstell in 2016, then the boss of high-end department store, Liberty. Upon noticing Endless‚Äô artwork whilst walking to work one day, Ed contacted Endless with an opportunity to paint the department stores main display window in honour of the 40 year anniversary of the punk movement. This made Endless the first ever street artist in history to paint the department stores coveted windows.

The album also features poet and songwriter Saul Williams. ==Background== The record is a follow-up album to his critically acclaimed triptych of albums named The Centennial Trilogy released in 2017. However, unlike the 2017 trilogy, Ancestral Recall is filled with many guest vocals. Scott explained that the title track and the whole album are \\"built as a map to decolonize sound; to challenge previously held misconceptions about some cultures of music; to codify a new folkloric tradition and begin the work of creating a national set of rhythms\\". To do so, he has weaved West African, First Nation, and African Diaspora/Caribbean rhythms and styles. He also mentioned that \\"All forms of expression in sound are valid, as all people are... this is the mantra of Ancestral Recall\\". The album consists of 12 tracks written mostly by Scott. The album was recorded on April 10, 15; September 6, 20; December 1, 2 of 2018 by Dave Weingarten at The Champagne Room West‚Äîand on April 29 and 30 of 2018 by Nick Guttmann at The Parlor, New Orleans, LA. The title track was released on February 5, 2019. Wales Arts Review included the record in its list of the best 50 albums of 2019. Also, NPR included the album in its list of best music of 2019, ranking it #15. ==Reception== At Metacritic, that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on five reviews, which indicates \\"universal acclaim\\". JazzTimes included the album in the top 40 new albums of the year, ranking it #8. The review stated, \\"With its layers of roiling African-suffused percussion crossbreeding with Western instrumentation, gripping spoken-word interludes, and Adjuah‚Äôs own trumpet and electronics, Ancestral Recall teems with audacity and authority.\\" Giovanni Russonello of The New York Times stated \\"Since 2015 he has placed a new emphasis on patterned, polyrhythmic drumming, using a tightened-up approach and more explicitly melding the sounds of modern hip-hop with ancient, diasporic rhythms... The new album unifies the winning elements of Mr. Scott‚Äôs past work: the historical syncretism, the tensile band energy, the powerful physicality. Mr. Scott is not a collegiate-sounding trumpet player, and he plays with as much deference to New Orleanian and continental African traditions as to bebop. As a result, he plays fewer notes than most jazz trumpeters today, and his projection is more immediately majestic. He is following a path of his own, and so far, it‚Äôs still breaking new ground\\". Piotr Orlov of Pitchfork Media added \\"On Ancestral Recall, few elements are left tethered to the time-worn rules of ‚Äújazz,‚Äù yet, as the title makes abundantly clear, the past remains paramount, and old global cultures the preferred engines into the future. Led by voice, drums, and electronics, this version of stretch music cuts most recognizable instrumental sounds loose\\". In her review for DownBeat, Suzanne Lorge commented, \\"At times on Ancestral Recall, trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah‚Äôs playing is so full of meaning that you almost can make out the intended words.\\" Relix's Jeff Tamarkin wrote, \\"This is relentlessly powerful stuff, yet it‚Äôs never overwhelming‚Äîit floats in the air more than it pounds. Adjuah doesn‚Äôt need to work overtime to find his way into your head and heart; Ancestral Recall welcomes you in.\\" Matt Bauer of Exclaim! stated \\"Far more textured, and with a deeper rhythmic foundation than Adjuah's previous offerings, Ancestral Recall is a syncopated and immersive delight... Cohesive and eclectic, Ancestral Recall is a sonic expedition to remember\\". Matt Collar of AllMusic commented \\"Ancestral Recall is a stylistically and culturally dynamic album borne out of Scott's deep awareness of his New Orleans roots and African American history, and his ability to push his forward-thinking post-bop skills into musical traditions far beyond jazz. However, the real revelation is that the album also manages to feel intensely personal, imbued throughout with a deep sensuality and romantic creative vision that feels distinctly his own\\". Jim Hynes of Glide Magazine stated \\"Close your eyes and imagine a New Orleans multi-cultural street parade 50 or 60 years from now ‚Äì pulsating rhythms, chants, and soaring horns that shift seamlessly from acoustic to electronic modes. There‚Äôs just so much to feast the ears on, that it takes multiple listens to begin to digest it. All forms of expression in sound are valid, according to Adjuah.

It focuses in detail on eleven pioneering figures of the transformation of yoga in the 20th century, including Yogendra, Kuvalayananda, Pant Pratinidhi, Krishnamacharya, B. K. S. Iyengar and Indra Devi. The book's thesis is that modern yoga progressed in three stages from its pre-1900 state to what is observed today. Before 1900, ha·π≠ha yoga was the despised religious practice of a small minority on the fringes of Indian society. In the first stage, pioneers such as Yogendra and Kuvalayananda treated yoga as the subject of medical inquiry, making it both secular and socially acceptable. Next, advocates of exercise brought standing poses from gymnastics into yoga: Pant Pratinidhi advocated Surya Namaskar (the sun salutation), a jumped sequence of poses, as daily exercise, while Krishnamacharya incorporated those poses and others as standing asanas in his yoga, along with the jumped transitions (vinyasas) between them, making yoga dynamic. Finally, two pupils of Krishnamacharya, B. K. S. Iyengar and Indra Devi, resacralised yoga, connecting the practice of asanas to ancient yoga tradition, and helped to spread yoga across the Western world. The book received mixed reviews, noting Goldberg's many years of study and the book's detailed account of yoga's transformations, but also its lack of an introduction, overview, or exploration of yoga's spiritual aspects. ==Context== The modern practice of yoga as a form of exercise developed from medieval ha·π≠ha yoga in the 20th century by discarding most of its practices and focussing on asanas, physical postures. At the same time, it acquired an element of aerobic exercise, initially through the adoption from physical culture of Surya Namaskar, the series of postures connected by flowing movements known as the sun salutation. In some modern styles of yoga, these flowing movements have developed into vinyasas, connecting sequences used throughout the yoga session. ==Book== Goldberg divides the path of modern yoga into three steps, corresponding to the three parts of the book: Medicalisation, becoming Dynamic, and Resacralisation. ===Synopsis=== The Path of Modern Yoga, based on what the author states is 10 years of research, examines the history of modern asana- based yoga through the lives of eleven pioneering figures: Sri Yogendra; Swami Kuvalayananda; Seetharaman Sundaram; Tirumalai Krishnamacharya; Swami Sivananda; the bodybuilder K. V. Iyer; the rajah of Aundh, Pant Pratinidhi; the journalist Louise Morgan; the diplomat Apa Pant; and two students of Krishnamacharya, his brother-in-law, B. K. S. Iyengar, and one of Iyengar's pupils, Indra Devi. The 35 chapters are arranged in three parts that cover the transformation of yoga during the modern period. The book maps out the development of modern yoga saw the original pre-1900 hatha yoga becoming divested of its sacred trappings (Part I); the resulting secular yoga was then made dynamic, with jumped transitions (vinyasas) between postures (Part II); and this dynamic, secular yoga was then resacralised (Part III). There is no introduction or conclusion. Part I, \\"Divesting Yoga of the Sacred\\", consists mainly of five chapters on Yogendra and five on Kuvalayananda, who pioneered the medical study of yoga, at the start of the 20th century the territory of despised vagrants, beggars, and fakirs, and in so doing helped to make yoga acceptable. Part II, \\"Making Yoga Dynamic\\", consists mostly of three chapters on Pant Pratinidhi, an enthusiast for exercise and a powerful advocate for Surya Namaskar; three on Krishnamacharya, described as the father of modern yoga, who incorporated many standing poses from the gymnastics of popular physical culture into his teaching, alongside the jumping transitions of Surya Namaskar, creating more standing poses and the dynamic vinyasa style of yoga that he taught to his pupils including Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, who went on to found yoga schools of their own; and three on Morgan. Part III, \\"Making Yoga Sacred Again\\", has two chapters on Devi, who helped to popularise yoga in America through her celebrity pupils in Hollywood; and seven on Iyengar, who made yoga precise, in particular with his 1966 book Light on Yoga, and who helped to spread yoga across the Western world, founding institutes of Iyengar Yoga, especially in Britain and in America. The book is illustrated with historic monochrome photographs of its protagonists and places associated with them, and a few drawings showing movements of the body and muscles affected. ==Reception== The book begins with 5 chapters on Yogendra, a pioneer of yoga as exercise. The book received some positive reviews. Krysta Gibson, reviewing the book for New Spirit Journal, writes that the book explains \\"how we went from yoga being a hidden, weird thing hippies and new agers did, to yoga studios on almost very corner\\". In her view, Goldberg \\"does a masterful job\\" of explaining the transformation. The San Francisco Book Review likewise comments that Goldberg describes yoga's \\"massive transition from spiritual practice to focusing on health and fitness\\". The review states that Goldberg's case is that \\"instead of desecrating a sacred tradition, this change moved yoga from solitary and inaccessible to embodied, spiritual, and open to everyone\\". The trade journal Publishers Weekly calls the book \\"a richly detailed examination of modern yoga\\" and suggests that it will appeal to both practitioners and scholars. The book devotes 7 of its 35 chapters to the yoga guru B. K. S. Iyengar. Niki Whiting, writing in Spiral Nature Magazine, was more doubtful. She comments that while she admired the research behind it, she struggled with the book, as it isn't an overview of the tradition and poses, nor a history of yoga's changes in the past 40 years, but \\"a specific history of yoga in the 20th century\\". She regretted the lack of an Introduction section in the book, and had been hoping for what she thought the subtitle suggested, a more spiritual or theological exploration. The critic and yoga teacher Matthew Remski compares historians of yoga to the fable of the blind men describing an elephant (one finds it flexible and leathery, another like a massive pillar, a third like a rope, a fourth smooth, polished, and cold...): Norman Sjoman found it influenced by South Indian wrestling exercises; Joseph Alter found it torn between esoteric and scientific; Mark Singleton discovered a collision of Western physical culture with Indian spirituality. In Remski's view, along comes \\"Goldberg with a dozen years of dogged research, a sleuthing style metered out in engaging chunks, a deep appreciation for the embodied sensations offered by competing visions of asana practice, a sharp eye for human foibles and historical oddities\\" and \\"makes a bold attempt to ride the elephant. As blindfolded as everyone else, he wobbles a bit, but hangs on for long enough to produce something that a lot of people have been waiting for: a penetrating, body-aware cultural history of a modern spirituality, written through richly realized characters.\\" What Remski says he misses in Goldberg's book is answers to questions like what Indian physical yoga was before the transformation. ==See also== * Yoga Body, Mark Singleton's 2010 book on the origins of global yoga in physical culture * Selling Yoga, Andrea Jain's 2015 book on the commercialisation of global yoga * The Subtle Body, Stefanie Syman's 2010 book on the history of yoga in America ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Modern yoga books Category:Yoga scholars ","title":"The Path of Modern Yoga"},{"id":"60300515","text":"The Nexus Tools Platform or NTP is a web-based inventory platform that allows an interactive comparison of environmental models in a statistical way. Developed by the UNU Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU-FLORES), the platform helps a user to analyze existing modelling tools related to environmental resource management and associated nexus perspectives, such as a Water-Energy-Food Nexus. As a result, the user can select the most appropriate tools to fit the research needs. ==Integrated Resources Management (Nexus Approach)== Considering an increase in the global population, the demand for both food and water is expected to grow by more than 50% by 2050.. At the same time, agricultural activity already puts significant stress on the quantity and quality of soils and freshwater resources worldwide. This leads to growing rates of land degradation and ecosystem deterioration. Long term solutions to those challenges require integrated management of environmental resources which can be also referred to as a Nexus Approach. This approach focuses on the synergies between sectors in order to minimize trade-offs, increase resource use efficiency, and improve environmental policy & governance which is crucial for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, the sustainable management of wastewater in crop production is considered as an implementation of a Water- Soil-Waste Nexus. ==Mission== Integrated resource management requires the use of integrated environmental modelling tools. However, there is no single model that can cover all complex interactions between natural resources such as water, soil, and waste. Moreover, there is a poor awareness of the available models and their capabilities which results in a time-consuming process of developing new models instead of using or further expanding already existing ones. With the objective of addressing the abovementioned problems, the Nexus Tools Platform has been created. It provides detailed visualizations of model descriptions and advanced filtering options using Kibana open-source visualization software. The platform does not attempt to include all possible models, but rather to provide a more efficient way to compare well-established ones and to keep the content updated through the feedback system with model users and developers. The screenshot of the Nexus Tools Platform visualization (March 2019) ==History== The first version of the website was published in April 2015 starting with the database of 60 models from around the world. A year later, a paper was published in Environmental Modelling & Software journal explaining the NTP development, data collection methodology, and application examples. In March 2018, NTP 2.0 was released with a greater number of available models (84), improved classification and visualization. Through the advanced search and filter functions, users could differentiate modelling tools in terms of model types, popularity, considered processes, input and output parameters, application areas (countries), programming language, etc. Recently, the whole database was refreshed and one more model was added making 85 in total. ==Data Sources== The data for the platform is collected in two ways: * The open access information which is available on the respective model websites, manuals, and publications. This information is further processed to fit the NTP classification system; * The information provided directly by the model developers. The current list of models includes a wide array of research areas from hydrology and land management to soil and water quality topics from a local to global scale. Some of the most popular examples are SWAT, MODFLOW, HEC-RAS, and CESM. The NTP is not intended to promote any of the models listed on the website. The information, whether in graphical or text form, is presented for scientific and educational purposes only. ==External links== * Scientific article about Nexus Tools Platform * Nexus Tools Platform website * The Nexus Approach * United Nations University Institute for Integrated Management of Material Fluxes and of Resources (UNU- FLORES) ==See also== * UNU-FLORES * United Nations University (UNU) * Water, energy and food security nexus ==References== Category:Environmental social science Category:Scientific modeling ","title":"Nexus Tools Platform"},{"id":"60300518","text":"Janville-en-Beauce is a commune in the Eure-et-Loir department in northern France.

Leon S. Reyes of the Philippine Constabulary (PC), who later served as a brigadier general and a military governor. She grew up amidst music and dance. Her mother's family included many musicians and her musician father could play many instruments. He was a regular participant at fiestas and special occasions in his hometown of Calamba.Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula, p.337-345. The National Artists of the Philippines. Cultural Center of the Philippines and National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Anvil Publishing. 2004. Reyes' father was an ardent lover of folk and ethnic art. Due to the demands of his military career, the family moved frequently and was consecutively assigned to Iloilo, Jolo, Kalibo, Capiz, Surigao, Dumaguete, Bacolod, Negros Oriental, Cotabato, Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental, Lanao and Mountain Province. Reyes learned to appreciate the distinct cultures of the various ethnic groups and was an active participant in the celebrations of festivals and rituals. Against this backdrop, Reyes developed an enduring interest in the arts, music and dance. While in Baguio, Reyes enrolled in a ballet class run by a Russian immigrant. She later obtained a degree in Education, specializing in Physical Education. She was asked by Francisca Reyes-Aquino, a pioneer in the revival of folk dance, to assist in documenting folk dances. == Career == Upon graduation, she taught at her alma mater, the Philippine Women's University. During this period, Reyes worked to collect and document tribal and ethnic dances, which she believed were a great cultural treasure waiting to be tapped and adapted to the stage. She used her knowledge of choreography and creative touch to transform these tribal dances into stage performances. At PWU she organized the Filipino Folk Music and Dance Committee, which concentrated on choreographed folk dances and their performance at fiestas and special occasions. She enrolled at San Francisco University (graduate studies in dance drama), Martha Graham School of Modern Dance at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Hanyagi School of Dancing of Japan. ===Performance=== Her group, later renamed PWU Philippine Delegation of Dancers and Musicians, traveled to Dhaka, East Pakistan and to participate in the International Festival of Dance and Music from December 25, 1954, to January 7, 1955. The host in Pakistan could produce only a guitar as an accompaniment. Reyes extended the group's repertoire and drew on native dances as a source. She compiled various Lanao and Cotabato dances, such as the dance of the slave, the dance of the warrior, and the dance of the Muslim princess called \\"Singkil\\". Her creative choreography enriched the program of her Bayanihan Dance Company as it performed at the Brussels World Exposition in 1958 and at Winter Garden in New York. Reyes earned accolades as she gave \\"form, substance and exciting color to what could have been simple ethnic dances,\\" which she translated to a theatrical art. Among the widely acclaimed dances she had staged were Singkil, a Bayanihan signature number based on a Maranao epic poem; Vinta, a dance honoring Filipino sailing prowess; Tagabili, a tale of tribal conflict; Pagdiwata, a four-day harvest festival condensed into a six- minute spectacle; Salidsid, a mountain wedding dance; and Idaw, Banga and Aires de Verbena.gwhs-stg02.i.gov.ph.

It was originally designed for a national contest to build a primary trainer but when this was won by the Rubik R-16 Lepke it was resigned to have more advanced soaring capability which could take pilots to their Silver C badge. Ninety were produced. ==Design and development== In 1948 the Hungarian National Aviation Association (Orsz√°gos Magyar Rep√ºl√∂ Egyes√ºlet or OMRE) announced a competition for single seat and two seat primary glider trainer designs. The winning single-seater was the Rubik R-16 Lepke, with Sandor Kem√©ny's K-01 in second place. The following year gave Kem√©ny an opportunity to build his design. So as to avoid competition with the R-16 he redesigned it into the K-02, with the help of Gy√∂rgy Mez≈ë from OMRE, so that it could ridge soar even in light winds. The prototype of the K-02 Szell≈ë was built by M√ÅV Istv√°ntelki F≈ëm≈±hely (Istv√°ntelki Workshop of the Hungarian Railways), first flying on 10 September 1949. The Szell≈ë was an all-wood, high wing, pod and boom design. Its wing had a rectangular inner section extending out to about half span, followed by tapered outer panels with most sweep on their trailing edges. There was a single main spar with plywood ahead of it around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box. Plywood also covered the wing ahead of an internal, diagonal drag strut on each side. Elsehere the wing was fabric-covered. Broad, parallel chord Frise-type ailerons filled the trailing edges of the outer panels. The prototype used a mixture of strut and wire bracing but the latter was omitted on the production K-02b Szell≈ë. Each bracing strut ran from the bottom of the fuselage to the spar at 25% span. The prototype K-02 had no airbrakes but production K-02bs had Rubik-type brakes which had three horizontal close-spaced metal channels channels in both lower and upper brakes, each channel fitting within the next for compact retraction. The pod was based upon a strong keel bearing transverse frames and with stringers strengthening its smooth, oval cross-section, plywood skin. The pilot's open cockpit below the wing leading edge also was supported by the keel. Behind the cockpit a four-sided box converged aft to triangular frames which supported the wing spar and the tail boom, giving the rear of the pod a near vertical but slightly forward leaning edge. There was a rubber-sprung landing skid under the keel. The prototype had another, short, skid at the rear of the pod but production Szell≈ës landed on a semi-recessed, landing wheel. The Szell≈ë's ply-covered tailboom tapered slightly in plan rearwards but maintained its depth to the tail, where it included an integral, steep- edged and round-topped fin, a low step for the strut-braced tailplane and a small tail bumper. The round-tipped tailplane was only slightly tapered, as were the elevators, which had a deep cut-out for rudder movement and a port side trim tab. Its rudder was generous, slightly angular and reached down to the tail bumper. ==Operational history== The first production Szell≈ë, built by Sport√°rutermel≈ë V., Esztergo flew on 20 August 1950. In all 89 were built and flew on into the 1960s, enabling many Hungarian glider pilots to gain their Silver-C. ==Variants== ;K-02:Sole prototype, built by M√ÅV Istv√°ntelki F≈ëm≈±hely (Istv√°ntelki Workshop of the Hungarian Railways) ;K-02b:Production model.

Murdoch played for Souths during the club's second golden era where they won 5 premierships in 6 seasons. ==Playing career== Murdoch began his first grade career with South Sydney in 1948. Murdoch's arrival coincided with the emergence of future immortal and club legend Clive Churchill. Murdoch missed out on playing in the 1949, 1950 and 1951 grand finals due to Churchill being in the team. In 1952, Churchill suffered an injury during the season and Murdoch finally was given a chance to play more regularly in the team. Murdoch played at fullback in the 1952 NSWRL grand final against Western Suburbs. Souths would lose the grand final 22-12. The match was remembered due to its controversy with claims the referee George Bishop had put a big wager on Wests winning the game. Souths claimed that they were denied two fair tries and Wests had scored one try off a blatant knock on. Murdoch missed out on playing in the 1953 and 1954 premiership victories but was then recalled to the starting team in 1955 due to another injury sustained to Churchill. Souths would reach the 1955 NSWRL grand final after a 9-game winning streak including coming from behind in both finals games. Murdoch played at fullback in the club's premiership victory over Newtown by a score of 12-11 which was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 45,000 spectators.

The series takes place in a parallel present, about thirty years after the bloody events of 1989, which ultimately led to the establishment of an ultra-Orthodox federation in Jerusalem where Jewish law reigns. However, Bnei Brak became a suburb of secular Tel Aviv. In order to move between the two entities, permits and border controls are necessary The local economy in the Haredi autonomy is facing difficulties. In addition, the government is governed by Jewish law and its ultra-Orthodox interpretation, which includes a prohibition on selling non-kosher food. The police in the autonomy are known as \\"guards\\" and they are dressed in a kind of Hasidic coats on which the ranks and symbols of the state are placed. They are tasked with maintaining order and the laws of religion and modesty in the autonomy. At the center of the plot is an ultra-Orthodox \\"macher\\" named Broide (Assi Cohen), who makes his living from small and forbidden smuggling between the secular State of Israel and the ultra-Orthodox autonomy. Goni, a girl raised by the secular couple Batia (Dana Ivgy) and Asher Luzzatto (Jacob Zada Daniel), turns out to be the daughter of Elka (Tali Sharon) and Halik Rein (Dan Castoriano), the daughter and son-in-law of the Rebbe of Kreinitz (Shuli Rand). Broide gets an offer from the Rebbe, who also receives smuggled books from him, in which he is required to kidnap the girl who is at the centre of a legal battle over custody between the two ultra-Orthodox and secular families. When he refuses to accept the offer, he is coerced by the Rebbe and his henchmen into accepting. In the end, he agrees to do so only after he's arrested on murder charger and the Rebbe gives him the opportunity to accept the task and thus not need to stand trial. Demanding that the Rebbe make a commitment to take care of his family in the event that he's harmed and to grant him a divorce from his wife, Blumi (Rotem Sela), the Rebbe accepted his terms. Broide goes on a mission and together with Anna, a woman from the secular State of Israel, they kidnap the girl and smuggle her to Ukraine while on the journey, Broida cuts off his beard and wigs and plans to start a new life in Europe with Anna. During the events Elka accuses her father of organizing the kidnapping for political purposes to scorch the proposal of a union between the religious autonomy and the secular State of Israel. Independently of her father, she cooperates with Batia, which leads to criticism of her father which causes the Rebbe's health to deteriorate and to return to his community in the town of Kreinitz in Europe. This is where he also plans to reunite the kidnapped girl with her biological parents, but after his daughter tells the media that she is renouncing her claim to her daughter, he demands the return the child to her adoptive parents. The two parents leave for Europe to take the child back from the kidnappers. The girl gets away from her abductors, Broide and Anna. She is reunited at the local police station with both her adoptive and biological parents, where the adoptive parents then take her home with them. In the meantime, the Rebbe dies, and Broide and Anna continue on a journey into Europe without the child. They are involved in a fatal train accident in which Anna dies and Broide is seriously injured. The body of a dead passenger is mistakenly identified as the body of Broide, and a message is transmitted to his ex-wife, who is married to Brody's friend Leibish. Broide struggles with his demons and meets the late Rebbe in a vision and responds to his request for absolution. Then he wakes up and returns to the ultra-orthodox autonomy. Upon returning he realizes that his ex-wife has remarried. He enters a Beit Midrash of a yeshiva and finds himself in a struggle between those who refuse to join the army and the Israeli Defence Force who are in the autonomy as part of the plan to annex the autonomy to the secular State of Israel. He becomes a conscientious objector and martyrs himself in opposition to the draft of Ultra-Orthodox men. ==Cast and characters== * Broide (Assi Cohen) - works in an ultra-Orthodox haredi community and smuggles objects from the secular state to the ultra-Orthodox. He is married to Blumi (Sela) with whom he has children but develops an extra-marital affair with Anna Blum (whom he calls \\"Hannah\\"). The Rebbe of Kreinitz assigns him the task of returning the Rebbe's granddaughter from the State of Israel to the Haredi autonomy. He is forced to agree after the other choice for him is to stand trial for the (accidental) murder of Bevchik. He goes on a kidnapping mission to Ukraine during which he undergoes a deep process of internal identity struggles. At the end of the series, he sets himself on fire as a protest against the enlistment of Haredim into the IDF. * Blumi Broide (Rotem Sela) - Yona's wife. She supports her husband but after pressure from the police on her and her children she begins to oppose his activities. Yona grants her a divorce, enabling her to marry Leibish. *The Rebbe of Kreinitz (Shuli Rand) - leader of the Haredi Autonomy. After learning about the fate of his granddaughter being raised by a secular couple in the State of Israel, he embarks on an uncompromising struggle to return the child to her parents and for this reason he also puts pressure on Yona Broide (Cohen) to return the child to the autonomy. In retrospect, it appears that he apparently did so in order to influence the Council of Sages to reject the proposal for unification with the State of Israel. After the procedure failed, his medical condition deteriorates and after a few days he dies. After his death, Broide sees him in a vision / dream, where he asks forgiveness for everything that happened between them. *Anna Blum (Daniella Kertesz) - a Tel Aviv jazz artist who develops a relationship with Broide after burying Gabriel, her partner who died of liver cancer. She helps Yona with his kidnapping mission. In the end, she is killed in a train accident in Ukraine. *Batia Luzzatto (Dana Ivgy) - Goni's French adoptive mother, married to Asher with whom she is in the process of divorcing. The struggle to maintain custody of their child brings them together. *Asher Luzzatto (Jacob Zada Daniel) - the adopted French father of Goni, who is married to Batya and is in the process of divorcing her. *Goni Luzzatto (Nir-Nur) - the biological daughter of the Reins and the granddaughter of the Rebbe of Kreinitz. After her birth, she was swapped without the knowledge of her parents in the hospital with Batya's original baby, who died, and she grew up in the home of the French couple in Tel Aviv. While her parents are about to divorce, the Raines' family demand that the child returns to the autonomy to be raised by her religious biological parents. Ultimately she stays with her adoptive parents. * Elka Rein (Tali Sharon) - daughter of the Rebbe of Kreinitz and wife of Hilik. Her daughter was switched at birth with Asher and Batia's dead baby and she is determined to get her back. Later she gives up her fight, for the good of the child. * Yechiel \\"Hilik\\" Rein (Dan Castoriano) - Elka's husband, son-in-law and disciple of the Rebbe Makrinitz, who listens more to him than to his wife. ==Reception== An acclaimed series in its country of origin, Israel, The Jerusalem Post described the show as darker than Shtisel, the previous TV collaboration of Elon and Indursky, concluding that \\"Autonomies is a disturbing, thought-provoking and alarming look at a world that never was.‚ÄùOne Nation, Divisible by God The Jerusalem Post.

She advocated for the right for Irish women to give birth at home or in non-medical settings. == Advocacy work == Philomena Canning was from Glenvar, County Donegal, and early in her career worked as a midwife in the Australian Outback and Saudi Arabia. She served as chair of an abortion advocacy group, Midwives for Choice in Ireland. In 2014 Canning's indemnity licence was withdrawn without notice as the cases of two women had come to the attention of the Health Service Executive (HSE). Neither of the women had complained, and the action was taken weeks after she had submitted a detailed application to the HSE to open two home birth centres in Dublin. Her indemnity was restored in February 2015 but she was unable to practise until the HSE carried out a system analysis. She was eventually declared free to practice in 2016 but by then she said that her business and reputation had been gravely undermined by the delays and false accusations. The HSE offered her a settlement after she initiated a damages case but she pressed to have the case heard in court to expose what were described as ‚Äúserious injustices‚Äù in her treatment. Further delays followed and she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer which then spread to her abdomen in 2018. She subsequently made a decision to settle the case as she was unable to afford to buy immunotherapy drugs to treat the terminal disease.

Somdutta is devoted to Brahmin rituals worshipping the Hindu gods. He practises celibacy and sex for him is a mode of reproduction only. Sumnima is very down to earth and knows how to live naturally. They spend a long time on the Koshi riverside and develop a deep affinity with each other. After their separation, Somdutta knows that Sumnima has become deeply rooted in his heart. The sexual desire for Sumnima haunts Somdutta till the end of his life. He realizes that the celibacy education, which should be a ladder to salvation and austerity, instead kept him away from true happiness and experiencing life. The novel discusses the issues of minority, cultural differences and ethnic consciousness through innocent characters. It documents the conflict and problems among the people living in the same area. ==References== Category:Nepalese novels Category:Nepali- language books ","title":"Sumnima"},{"id":"60300764","text":"Ken Brogan (1927-2006) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s and 1950s. He played for South Sydney in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition during the club's second golden era where they won 5 premierships from 7 grand final appearances between 1949 and 1955. ==Background== Brogan was the son of Frank Brogan who was a premiership winning player with South Sydney in the 1920s. Brogan was a ball boy with Souths before being graded by the club at the age of 16. ==Playing career== Brogan made his first grade debut for Souths in 1945. In the same year, the club finished last on the table winning only one game all season. The following year it did not get any better for Souths as they went the entire 1946 season without winning a game. In 1949, Brogan made 19 appearances as Souths claimed the minor premiership and reached the grand final against St George. Brogan played in the match as Souths lost the grand final 19-12 with St George claiming their second premiership. In 1952, Souths reached their 4th grand final in a row against Western Suburbs. Souths would lose the grand final 22-12 with Brogan playing at halfback. The match was remembered due to its controversy with claims the referee George Bishop had put a big wager on Wests winning the game. Souths claimed that they were denied two fair tries and Wests had scored one try off a blatant knock on. Brogan played on in 1953 but missed out on playing in the club's premiership victory over St George as Ray Mason was chosen to play instead.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.

Manila Water COO Geodino Carpio cited the delay of water infrastructure projects, such as the constructions of a wastewater treatment plant in Cardona, Rizal and the Kaliwa Dam in Tanay, Rizal, for the issue. Manila Water also noted the critically low levels of the reservoir held by La Mesa Dam, its lowest level in 12 years, which the company relies on as their emergency supply of water source.

It was designed by William Henry Playfair for Charles Lennox Cumming-Bruce, and was completed in 1829. Originally designated a Category B listed building in 1971, it was upgraded to Category A in 1987, and remains a privately owned residence. ==History== Dunphail House was built between 1828 and 1829 according to a design by William Henry Playfair, the architect responsible for many of the neoclassical buildings in Edinburgh's New Town. It was built near the site of the now-ruined Dunphail Castle for Charles Lennox Cumming-Bruce, a Scottish Conservative politician. Plans for a new house on the site had already been drawn up by John Baxter in 1787, and by John Patterson from 1817-1820, but it was Playfair's plans, which were his first commission for a country house, that were eventually executed. The same year construction was completed, the nearby River Divie flooded and threatened to destroy the house, with the river bank reportedly collapsing to within a yard of the foundations. Substantial additions were made to the house in 1871 by Alexander Ross. Electric lighting was first installed in 1883, drawing power from a dynamo turned by water from the River Divie. The interior plasterwork was extensively remodelled between 1928 and 1932 under the direction of John Wittet CBE, president of the Inverness Architectural Association and Lord Provost of Elgin. Renovation work by Ronald Phillips and Partners, sensitive to the original design, removed substantial parts of Ross's addition in 1964. The house was designated a category B listed building in 1971; it was upgraded to category A in 1987. ==Description== The building is of a rectangular Italianate design, mostly of two storeys but with a three-storey tower at the west gable with a pyramidal roof. The original design featured a porte-coch√®re frontage, which Ross removed and reattached to his own additions in 1871; the 1960s renovation work replaced Ross's frontage with the current porch, which reuses Playfair's original parapet, and features a pair of Roman Doric columns and a Neo-Georgian fanlight. It is constructed of pinned rubble, with polished and tooled ashlar sandstone detailing. Aside from Wittet's plasterwork, the interior mostly dates from the 1960s renovations, with little of Playfair's original work remaining other than the shape and layout of the rooms. The house remains a privately owned residence. == References == Category:Country houses in Moray Category:Italianate architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Category A listed buildings in Moray ","title":"Dunphail House"},{"id":"60301066","text":"Abe no Iratsume (ÈòøÂÄçÂ•≥ÈÉé or ÂÆâÂÄçÂ•≥ÈÉé; dates unknown) was a Japanese waka poet of the Nara period. == Biography == The exact birth and death dates of Abe no Iratsume (literally, \\"the lady Abe\\") are unknown, but she probably lived from around the Wad≈ç era (began 708) to around the H≈çki era (ended 780). == Poetry == Abe no Iratsume is the credited author of five poems included in books III and IV of the Man'y≈çsh≈´.

The novel follows the lives of Samuel \\"Sami\\" Perlman, his son Elio Perlman, and Oliver, characters established in Aciman's 2007 novel Call Me By Your Name. ==Summary== The novel is split into four sections: Tempo, Cadenza, Capriccio, and Da Capo. Each of the sections focus on a different character's point of view, and this is not stated explicitly. The sections vary in length, with Tempo being the longest at almost half the book and Da Capo the shortest. Tempo: Ten years after the events of Call Me By Your Name, Sami Perlman meets a younger woman named Miranda while traveling by train to Rome. The two quickly grow close, and strike up a romantic relationship. While in Rome, the couple visit Miranda's ailing father, attend a public lecture held by Sami, and meet with Elio. Cadenza: Five years later, Elio works as a piano teacher in Paris. At a concert he meets an older man named Michel, and they begin a romantic relationship. They visit Michel's childhood home in the French countryside, and end their relationship amicably several weeks later. Capriccio: Several years later, Oliver works as a professor at a college in New Hampshire. He is married with children, but harbors nostalgia for the time he spent with Elio as a college student. He reunites with Elio in Italy, and they reconnect romantically. Though Sami has died, he fathered a child with Miranda, whom they named Oliver. Da Capo: Elio and Oliver are together again, raising Little Ollie, Elio's half brother. ==Background== On December 6, 2017, when asked about a proposed sequel to the film adaptation of Call Me by Your Name, Aciman replied that \\"the problem with a sequel is that you need plot.\\" On December 3, 2018, Aciman announced on his Twitter account that he was writing a sequel to Call Me by Your Name. The novel's title and release date were officially confirmed on March 20, 2019. In an interview, Aciman stated that: \\"The world of Call Me by Your Name never left me. Though I created the characters and was the author of their lives, what I never expected was that they'd end up teaching me things about intimacy and about love that I didn't quite think I knew until I'd put them down on paper. The film made me realize that I wanted to be back with them and watch them over the years‚Äîwhich is why I wrote Find Me\\". ==Release== The novel was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on October 29, 2019. The audiobook is read by actor Michael Stuhlbarg, who portrayed Sami in the film adaptation of Call Me by Your Name. Ahead of its release, on October 11, 2019, Vanity Fair published an exclusive excerpt from the novel, along with two illustrations by Jenny Kroik. ==Critical reception== Find Me was met with mixed reviews from literary critics, with review aggregator Book Marks reporting five negative and six mixed reviews among 26 total. ==References== Category:2019 American novels Category:Novels set in Italy Category:Novels set in New England Category:Call Me by Your Name Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books ","title":"Find Me (novel)"},{"id":"60301156","text":"Choi Won-jae (Hangul: ÏµúÏõêÏû¨, born October 26, 1993), better known by his stage name Kid Milli (Hangul: ÌÇ§ÎìúÎ∞ÄÎ¶¨), is a South Korean rapper.

The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The period for negotiation stated in Article 50 is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed. In March 2019, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May and European Leaders negotiated a two-week delay for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to agree upon The Government's Brexit Treaty, moving the date from 29 March 2019 to 12 April 2019. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding Brexit began in June 2017. ==Timeline== === June 2017 === On 19 June 2017, David Davis arrived in Brussels to start negotiations with Michel Barnier. Terms of reference were agreed, and dates were set for four-week cycles, to culminate in a fifth round of negotiations in the week commencing 9 October. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain's outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. On 22 June 2017, Prime Minister May guaranteed, at a European Council meeting in Brussels, that no EU citizen living legally in the UK would be forced to leave, and she offered that any EU citizen living in the UK for more than 5 years until an unspecified deadline between March 2017 and March 2019 would enjoy the same rights as a UK citizen, conditional on the EU providing the same offer to British expatriates living in the EU. The EU leaders did not immediately reciprocate the offer, with Council President Tusk objecting that the European Council is not a forum for the Brexit negotiations, and Commission president Juncker stating \\"I'm not negotiating here.\\" The Prime Minister detailed her residency proposals in the House of Commons on 26 June 2017, but drew no concessions from EU negotiators, who had declined to expedite agreement on expatriates by the end of June 2017, and who are hoping for European courts to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK with regards to EU citizens, according to their negotiation aims published in May 2017. === July 2017 === The second round of negotiations began in Brussels in mid-July 2017. It is considered the beginning of substantial negotiations, with 98 UK negotiators and 45 EU27 negotiators. Progress is being made on the Northern Irish border question, whereas UK negotiators have requested a detailed breakdown of the \\"divorce bill\\" demand estimated at 65 billion euros, while the EU negotiators criticise the UK's citizenship rights offer. At the concluding press conference, David Davis did not commit to a net payment by the UK to the EU with regards to the requested divorce bill, while Michel Barnier explained that he would not compromise on his demand for the European Court of Justice to have continuing jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit, rejecting the compromise proposal of a new international body made up of British and EU judges. On citizens' rights, a joint paper compared the positions of the two parties in tabular form. On Irish border issues, both parties stated that they remained committed to the Good Friday Agreement. Michel Barnier called for clarification from the UK in the August round on the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland, including on how the UK intends to maintain the Common Travel Area. === August 2017 === On 16 August 2017, the British government disclosed the first of several papers detailing British ambitions following Brexit, discussing trade and customs arrangements. On 23 August 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Britain will leave the EU Court of Justice's direct jurisdiction when the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 ends, but that both the British courts and the EU Court of Justice will also keep \\"half an eye\\" on each other's rulings afterwards as well. One of the UK government's position papers published in August called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU. The third round of negotiations began in Brussels on 28 August 2017. The European Commission president Juncker criticised the UK's Brexit negotiations, saying none of the papers provided so far was satisfactory and that there would be no trade negotiations between the EU and UK until the divorce bill was settled. He had previously claimed that the UK's Brexit bill could be ¬£55bn (which Theresa May's government ministers consider unacceptable) and EU Budget Commissioner G√ºnther Oettinger voiced the view that the UK should make payments until 2023. The Irish Times explained the disagreement as follows: British negotiators referred to the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF or Maff) for the period 2014‚Äì2020 agreed by member states and the EU parliament as a \\"planning tool\\" for the next period rather than a legally-binding financial obligation on member states. The British case is that the MFF sets ceilings on spending under various headings and is later radically revised during the annual budget process when real legal obligations on each state arise. This contrasts with the EU Commission's methodology for calculating the UK Brexit bill which involves dividing the MFF into the shares historically agreed by each member state. On the Irish border question, there was a \\"breakthrough\\", with the British side guaranteeing free movement of EU citizens within the Common travel area constituting Ireland and the United Kingdom. The BBC's Europe correspondent commented \\"the British perception of the talks is more positive than the EU's\\". An agreement was reached on points including protecting the rights of frontier workers (those living in one country and working in another); recognition by the UK of social security contributions made both before and after exit; and continuation of healthcare reimbursement for UK citizens who are in the EU27 on exit day and vice versa. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was updated. Speaking at the conclusion of the talks, Michel Barnier highlighted two areas of disagreement: the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing citizens' rights, and the extent of the UK's financial obligations. He stated \\"Time is passing quickly\\" and added that \\"at the current speed, we are far from being able to recommend to the European Council that there has been sufficient progress in order to start discussions on the future relationship\\". === September 2017 === The Ambrosetti Forum is held annually in the Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. At the elite European Ambrosetti Forum on 2 September 2017, Michel Barnier explained his negotiation aims, in that he would \\"teach the British people and others what leaving the EU means\\". Although this remark caused controversy in the UK, BBC correspondent Mark Mardell interpreted it in the context of French and Dutch euroscepticism, of the forthcoming German, Austrian and Italian elections, and of the eurosceptic Polish and Hungarian governments. In a statement to Parliament on 5 September 2017, David Davis said that \\"concrete progress\\" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border, while significant differences over the \\"divorce bill\\" remain. He expected that \\"the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation. The famous European \\"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\\" will apply here absolutely, as anywhere else\\". On 6 September 2017, Prime Minister May announced that new immigration controls will be placed on EU nationals when Brexit concludes. On 7 September, the EU Task Force published guiding principles for the dialogue on Ireland / Northern Ireland which reiterated and expanded the principles given in 29 April guidelines, in particular the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the continuation of the Common Travel Area. On 9 September 2017, the EU Commission published several negotiating papers, including \\"Guiding Principles on the Dialogue for Ireland/Northern Ireland\\". In it, the EU concedes/declares that it is the responsibility of the UK to propose solutions for the post-Brexit Irish border. The paper envisages that a \\"unique\\" solution would be permissible here; in other words, any such exceptional Irish solution should not be seen as a template for post-Brexit relationships with the other EU members on border and customs control matters, for example ETIAS. On 21 September 2017, Prime Minister May, along with her Cabinet, agreed to a transition deal which would inject 20bn euros to the EU budget over a two-year period. A cabinet source confirmed to the BBC that May's Cabinet was in fact unity around the Prime Minister's two-year transition deal. On 22 September 2017, May announced the details of her Brexit proposal during a speech in Florence, Italy. In addition to offering 20 billion euros over a two-year transition period and continued acceptance of European immigrants, she also offered a \\"bold new security relationship\\" with the EU which would be \\"unprecedented in its depth\\" and to continue to make \\"an ongoing contribution\\" to projects considered greatly to the EU and UK's advantage, such as science and security projects. She also confirmed that the UK would not \\"stand in the way\\" of Juncker's proposals for further EU integration. The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed May's proposal as \\"constructive\\", but that it also \\"must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress;\\" Similarly, President of France Emmanuel Macron was adamant that the EU would not begin negotiations on future EU-UK relationships until \\"the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit, and the questions of Ireland\\" were \\"clarified\\" by the UK, though he also acknowledged that May did give openings in her speech on two of these three points. Ireland Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave May's proposal a \\"cautious welcome\\", saying that while it was good of May to reference the Common Travel Area, the Northern Ireland peace process and that both sides in the negotiations do not want any physical structures at the border, more negotiations were needed for clarification. EU Parliamentary negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that \\"a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question\\". EU negotiators have stated that an agreement must be reached between Britain and the EU by October 2018 to leave time for national parliaments to endorse Brexit. On the domestic front, Labour Party MP and Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott announced she would back May's proposed negotiation for the Brexit timetable. The fourth round of talks began on 25 September, having been delayed by one week as Theresa May was due to deliver a speech in Florence on the 22nd. She proposed a transitional \\"implementation period\\" of \\"around two years\\" and said that the UK \\"will honour commitments\\" so as to not make other EU countries pay more or receive less during the current EU budget period. Barnier declared he had no mandate from the EU27 to discuss a transition deal suggested by Prime Minister May. Davis reiterated that the UK could honour commitments made during its EU membership only in the context of a future \\"special partnership\\" deal with the EU. The programme for the round of talks arranged for meetings between the \\"Principals\\" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens' rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the \\"Coordinators\\", and governance of the withdrawal agreement was also for discussion at technical level. David Davis repeated Theresa May's request for a time-limited implementation period. The UK offered to incorporate the Withdrawal Agreement into UK law and ensure the UK courts can refer directly to it, but there was no agreement on the role of the European Court of Justice and the standing of future ECJ case law. Mr Barnier welcomed the UK's commitment regarding payments into the current EU budget plan, but expressed reservations about obligations beyond 2020. Mr Davis said the UK was not yet in a position to quantify its commitments. There were constructive discussions on the Irish border, but no substantive progress. The UK accepted the EU's definition of 'citizens lawfully resident before the cut off date', although that date was not agreed. There was agreement on the definitions of permanent and temporary residence. The UK offered a more generous \\"right of return\\" (after absence for longer than two consecutive years) than the minimum rights under current EU law. Rights of future family members remains a point of disagreement. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was again updated. === October 2017 === On 9 October 2017, May announced to the British Parliament that Britain could operate as an \\"independent trading nation\\" after Brexit if no trade deal is reached with the EU. The fifth round of negotiations was held on 9, 10 and 12 October. There was technical progress on citizens' rights, although divergences remained on aspects of family reunion and the export from the UK of social security benefits. The UK stated an intention to offer a simple process for registration of EU citizens. On the Irish border, work continued to map out current areas of cooperation and build a picture of the future challenges. This round of talks completed the timetable agreed in June, with no further rounds scheduled. On the financial settlement, Michel Barnier welcomed the commitment made by Theresa May in her Florence speech, but no negotiations took place because the UK was not ready to give details of what it would pay. Barnier said this issue had reached an impasse. On 16 October, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker issued a joint statement agreeing Brexit talks should \\"accelerate over the months to come\\" following a dinner meeting in Brussels which both described as \\"constructive and friendly.\\" However, as at a similar dinner earlier in 2017, an unflattering \\"impressionistic\\" account of this meeting (between Prime Minister Theresa May, her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier) was published in the same German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. Again, Juncker's chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr was accused as the source of the publication and of trying to undermine the negotiations. This time however Selmayr denied the accusation, and Chancellor Merkel reportedly denied her involvement. On 17 October, Brexit Secretary David Davis insisted that there will be no deal for a transition phase without EU cooperation and that Brexit will happen regardless, even if there is what one Conservative MP described as \\"a bridge to nowhere.\\" At the European Council meeting of 19/20 October 2017, the 27 leaders of the EU states were to decide whether or not to start trade negotiations with the UK. However, Davis has conceded that so soon after the German elections on 24 September, a German coalition government may not be in place in time for making this decision in October, delaying any European Council decision until their December meeting. On 19 October, the first day of the two-day European Council meeting in Brussels, May issued a direct message to approximately three million EU citizens living in Britain, promising she will make it as easy as possible for them to stay after Brexit. On 20 October, Tusk described media reports of the deadlock in Brexit talks as \\"exaggerated.\\" On 23 October, May announced to the House of Commons that Brexit talks underwent \\"important progress\\" during her recent meeting with the European Council and that Britain was now \\"in touching distance\\" of a trade deal with EU countries, while also reiterating that no transition phase will take place following the conclusion of Brexit without a trade deal as well. The same day, Juncker denied reports by the German media that May had \\"begged for help\\" during their recent dinner meeting. === November 2017 === Further talks were held in Brussels on 9 and 10 November. Speaking at the closing press conference, Michel Barnier confirmed that clarification on financial commitments by the UK was required within the next two weeks. If the informal deadline is not met, the next phase of negotiations will not start in December, said Barnier. EU diplomats have described the situation as a \\"chicken and egg dilemma\\", as the EU will only start working on transition guidelines if Britain makes progress on financial issues by the end of November 2017. By 17 November, however, Donald Tusk said there was no deadlock in talks between Britain and the EU following a meeting with Theresa May in Gothenburg, Sweden, and that he was optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in December. Discussions on the financial settlement took place later in the month, led by Oliver Robbins for the UK and Sabine Weyand for the EU. David Davis rejected an EU proposal that Northern Ireland could remain in the EU customs union (thereby creating a customs border \\"down the Irish Sea\\" with Great Britain). In the wake of the German elections (23 September 2017), as of 10 November, negotiations were still ongoing to form a coalition government between Frau Merkel's CDU, the sister party CSU, the economically liberal FDP and the German Greens; politicians from all three factions published an appeal to reach a coalition agreement (rather than risk new elections), in the interest of Germany forming a \\"stable anchor\\" to unite with France and defend the EU and the euro in the current situation. === December 2017 === Negotiations between officials led to a draft agreement which was expected to be finalised at a meeting between Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May in Brussels on 4 December 2017. There was progress on the financial settlement and citizens' rights, but the meeting was abandoned after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party objected to arrangements for the Irish border; the agreement had earlier received the support of Leo Varadkar, Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister). Talks continued on the following days, leading to publication on 8 December of a joint report setting out the commitments to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. \\"Agreement in principle\\" was reached on the three areas: * protecting the rights of Union citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the Union * the framework for addressing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland * the financial settlement. A joint technical note gave details of the consensus on citizens' rights. Topics postponed to a later phase included: * rights of UK citizens resident in an EU27 country on the withdrawal date to move to another EU27 country, and their right to return to the UK * recognition of professional qualifications, beyond those already mutually recognised at the withdrawal date. Juncker described the agreement as a \\"breakthrough\\" Brexit deal. The second phase of negotiations ‚Äì concerning Britain's post-Brexit trade with the EU ‚Äì would now be able to take place as a result of the agreement. The second phase was to cover the arrangements for transition towards the UK's withdrawal, together with the framework for the future relationship. After more than 2 months of a caretaker German government since the German federal elections in September, on 7 December 2017 new elections were averted when the German socialist party under Martin Schulz agreed to negotiate a coalition government with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, but on condition that a \\"United States of Europe\\" be created by 2025, dismissing those EU member states who were unwilling to participate. The following day (8 December), the UK and EU negotiators agreed on the principle that \\"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\\" and formally announced to proceed immediately to the next phase of talks on a transition period and future trade relationships. On 15 December, the European Council adopted guidelines for the second phase of the negotiation covering arrangements for transition towards the UK's withdrawal, together with the framework for the future relationship. The document confirmed that progress in the first phase was \\"sufficient\\", while stating that commitments made in that phase must be \\"translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible\\"; and notes the UK's proposal for a transition period of \\"around two years\\". On 20 December, the European Commission published a draft of the negotiating directives stating a transition period should not last beyond 31 December 2020. During the transition the United Kingdom would not be part of agreements the EU made on behalf of its members with third countries, such as CETA. In December 2017, EU leaders announced an agreement to begin the next phase of negotiations, with talks on a transition period after March 2019 to begin in early 2018 and discussions on the future UK‚ÄìEU relationship, including trade and security, to begin in March. ==See also== *Brexit negotiations in 2018 *Brexit negotiations in 2019 ==References== ==External links== * UK Parliament ‚Äì Brexit News * Gov.UK ‚Äì Department for Exiting the European Union * UK Government ‚Äì \\"Plan for Britain\\" website * Europa (EU official website) ‚Äì UK ‚Äì Brexit ‚Äì overview * European Commission ‚Äì Brexit negotiations website * European Commission ‚Äì list of published negotiating documents * European Commission ‚Äì Preparedness notices * Brexit, EC, CEU Timeline and list of key documents for Brexit negotiations * The Principle of Loyalty in EU Law, 2014, by Marcus Klamert, Legal Officer, European Commission * Resource page and commentary by David Allen Green * Exchange Rates UK ‚Äì Brexit Timeline With Chart for Impact on Pound Sterling * Explanatory Memorandum for the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 introduced by the Irish government in the legislature (Oireachtas) Negotiation Category:Negotiation Category:2017 in the European Union Category:2017 in British politics Category:Membership treaties of the European Union Category:Disaster preparedness ","title":"Brexit negotiations in 2017"},{"id":"60301232","text":"Brexit negotiations in 2018 took place between the United Kingdom and the European Union for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union following the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum on 23 June 2016. The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The period for negotiation stated in Article 50 is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed. In March 2019, UK prime minister Theresa May and European leaders negotiated a two-week delay for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to agree on the government's Brexit treaty, moving the date from 29 March 2019 to 12 April 2019. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding Brexit began in June 2017, with the following negotiations taking place during 2018. ==Timeline== === January 2018 === Discussions on the outstanding issues continued and were described as \\"low-key\\". On 29 January 2018, the European Council adopted and published negotiating directives. These stated that the whole of the EU acquis (the rights and obligations binding on all member states) would continue to apply to the UK during the proposed transition period, and the UK would continue to be within the customs union and the single market, while no longer participating in EU decision-making. The UK's position was outlined in speeches and interviews. === February 2018 === Several meetings took place between the negotiators. === March 2018 === Due to the ambivalence of UK on the Irish border question, Tusk declared in March 2018 \\"We know today that the UK Government rejects a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, the EU single market, and the customs union.\\" Tusk said that talks cannot proceed around this issue, that it must be resolved first. In March 2018 resolution, the MEPs expect an EU‚ÄìUK agreement which safeguard the framework of existing commercial relationships between the EU and third countries with consistency for keeping a tuned tariff and quota system and rules of origin for products vis-√†-vis third countries, and also a transitional arrangements fully compatible with WTO obligations to not disrupt trade relations with third countries. On 19 March, the transition period was agreed, but it would not be considered legally binding until after ratification of the wider agreement on withdrawal: \\"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,\\". On 19 March, a version of the document was published, showing text in green as having been agreed. (75% agreed). * green areas include citizens rights and the financial settlement. * white areas concern police and judicial cooperation. * in yellow: The Northern Ireland border representing the agreement struck in December but the lack of clarity on what that could mean in practice. A curious development with this release was the avoidance of mentioning what will happen with the free movement rights of UK citizens living abroad on the basis of those rights. The section which previously stated that those rights would be removed, article 32, was removed from the agreement, although references to it remain in other parts of the document. === June 2018 === On 10 June 2018, the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar cleared the path for the June negotiations by postponing the Irish border question until the final Brexit deal in October 2018. On 19 June 2018, the UK and the EU published a joint statement outlining agreements at the negotiators' level. Michel Barnier praised the \\"dedication and commitment\\" of the negotiating teams, and said progress had been made in issues like customs, VAT and the European nuclear agreement, Euratom. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 that became law in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2018, and two bills that were then progressing through Parliament relating to world and cross-border trade after the withdrawal, allow for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. The two bills passed from the House of Commons to the House of Lords in July 2018. === July 2018 === On 6 July, the UK Government announced that the May Cabinet had agreed that it should propose a \\"UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products\\" [but not services] after Brexit. A few days earlier, senior EU officials had intimated that a proposal for \\"partial\\" membership of the European Single Market would not be welcomed. Before the Cabinet meeting at Chequers on 6 July, Barnier stated that the EU would accept a trade agreement with the UK if it does not damage the European Single Market. However, he said the EU would not shift its own red line on the single market, which he said was \\"not and never should be seen as a big supermarket; it is economic, cultural and social life, it should be developed in all its dimensions\\". On 10 July 2018, Barnier announced that 80% of the Brexit deal was now complete. The government published the \\"Chequers plan\\" on 12 July. In response to a statement about it by the Secretary of State, the opposition spokesman said that it was a disgrace that it had been shown to the media from 9 a.m. that morning but it had not been shown to MPs until hours later.It was finalised at a meeting of the UK Cabinet held at Chequers on 6 July. Brexit Secretary David Davis resigned over the agreement on 8 July, while former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson followed him the next day, saying that the government allowed \\"a fog of self-doubt\\" to fall on its negotiations. While the President of the United States Donald Trump was on a visit to the United Kingdom on 13 July, his comment ‚Äì made in an exclusive interview with The Sun ‚Äì that the UK would probably not get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's plan went ahead, was widely published in the media. Later the same day he stated, in a joint press conference with May at Chequers, that the Prime Minister was \\"doing a fantastic job\\" as prime minister, and contrary reports were \\"fake news\\", but he only asked for an \\"even\\" deal with the UK, and, complaining about EU trade barriers and tariffs on cars, he said that the US lost $151 billion to the EU. While the negotiations continued, the UK government confirmed in the House of Commons on 19 July that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, as stated in the withdrawal act and the white paper. The first meeting of Dominic Raab, the newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was later on the same day (19 July 2018) in Brussels. Raab offered to meet Barnier throughout August to \\"intensify\\" talks, while both the UK and EU were insisting that reaching agreement by the autumn on the UK withdrawal in March 2019 was still very much on the cards. On 20 July, May repeated her opposition to the EU's proposals for the Irish border question during a speech in Belfast, stating that the EU must \\"evolve\\" and that there would be no further compromises over the issue. Just hours after the Prime Minister's remarks, Barnier expressed scepticism towards the Chequers plan. On 24 July, May announced that she would now lead the Brexit negotiations with the EU and that Raab was now only \\"deputizing\\" on her behalf. On 26 July, Barnier held another meeting with Raab and both stated afterwards stated in a joint press conference that \\"sufficient progress\\" had been made in the trade negotiations. Raab also stated during the joint press conference that \\"a lot has been achieved.\\" Barnier also stated that both sides wanted a wide-ranging free trade deal and that he would meet again with Raab in mid-August. However, he also acknowledged that obstacles remained due to the White Paper's proposal to allow Britain to collect custom duties on behalf of the EU and that the proposal would never be accepted for any non-member. Barnier also stated that the only other challenge in the trade negotiations was finalizing an agreement between both sides concerning a backstop that guarantees a frictionless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Barnier stated that the EU holds \\"no objections in principle\\" to the backstop, but has \\"doubts that it can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.\\" === August 2018 === On 2 August 2018, Barnier announced the EU was \\"ready to improve the EU proposal\\" on the issue of the Ireland border. Barnier stated that the EU was willing to be flexible on the details of the proposed backstop, but will \\"not change the substance\\". The backstop was originally proposed by the EU and has been a source of tension in the negotiations with Britain, which has viewed the backstop as a threat to the union with Northern Ireland. However, Barnier also stated the White Paper's customs proposal still remains an issue. On 9 August, The Times and Business Insider said that EU had made concessions and agreed to accept, among other things, a free trade deal which does not include free movement of EU citizens. Under the proposal, the EU would also accept the terms outlined in the White Paper if Britain agreed to abide by the EU's social, environment and customs rules. However, this would also include keeping Britain in the European Single Market for a longer period, which is a matter of concern for the British government. Agreeing to the single market proposal could potentially mean that Britain will be unable to change laws to give it a competitive edge against the EU and could hinder any chance of signing additional trade deals. On 16 August, EU and British officials began two days of talks to resolve the issue concerning the Irish border. However, Barnier and Raab did not attend the talks and both sides indicated there would be little chance of a breakthrough. On 16 August, leaked documents obtained by Buzzfeed News showed that May had now set plans for a \\"no-deal\\" Brexit for \\"84 areas of life.\\" The May government intends to start publicly disclosing the plans in the following week as a warning to the EU. On 18 August, The Daily Telegraph reported that the first batch of the papers detailing a no-deal Brexit are due to be published on 23 August. On 21 August, Barnier said that the EU and Britain would not reach a trade deal by the October EU summit and that an emergency summit would have to be held in either November or December. Both sides still disagree over a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. While there is a possibility that there could be a summit in December, this is highly unlikely to occur and November would be the most likely month to hold an emergency summit. Gabriele Zimmer, a leftist German member of the European Parliament who deals with Brexit, told Reuters \\"we didn't see any concrete proposal that would work on the Irish border issue. November is the last moment. December is already too late for us.\\" Despite the setback, however, Raab and Barnier both agreed to hold \\"continuous talks\\" in an effort to resolve the deadlock. Barnier stated that talks had previously been held in \\"rounds\\" every few weeks. The first batch of \\"no-deal\\" Brexit advice was published by Raab on 23 August. On 29 August, Barnier announced in Berlin that the EU would now offer a trade deal which would ensure close ties between the EU and Britain following Brexit. Barnier described the proposed trade deal as a partnership \\"such as there never has been with any other third country.\\" Though \\"red lines\\" still remained between the EU and Britain, Barnier also stated that the EU would also respect Britain's red lines, such as the Northern Ireland border, so long as Britain did not undermine the European Single Market. The same day, Raab announced to a House of Lords committee that a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU was now \\"within our sights.\\" Raab also stated that a vote at the EU October summit was still possible and that only \\"a measure of leeway\\" remained over the precise timetable for the agreement. On 31 August, Raab and Barnier held a joint press conference in Brussels. Both stated that progress was made in the negotiations. Raab stated that Britain was now committed to a vote on a Brexit trade deal at the SU October Summit and that he was \\"stubbornly optimistic that a trade deal was \\"within reach.\\" Barnier stated that the EU was also committed to an October EU Summit vote and that the \\"building blocks\\" of a trade deal were now falling into place. Certain issues are still being worked out. === September 2018 === On 4 September 2018, Raab stated to other MPs that he was now \\"confident\\" that the White Paper's proposals, dubbed the Chequers plan, would serve as the basis of the UK-EU trade deal. Raab also described the feedback from the EU as \\"positive.\\" The same day, the cross border trade bill passed its second reading, committee stages and third reading in the House of Lords; it later became law after receiving Royal Assent on 13 September. On 5 September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel dropped a key demand and announced that Germany would now accept a trade deal that is not fully detailed. Merkel also stated that Germany would work to preserve good and close relations with Britain following Brexit. On 5 September EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas stated that the EU saw some \\"positive element\\" in the Chequers plan and urged journalists to wait for a transcript to be published before making assumptions about how the EU feels about it. On 7 September, it was revealed that Barnier had made a concession to a group of British MPs and stated that the EU will allow the trade agreement to be linked to the Brexit \\"divorce bill.\\" The EU Commission had long insisted that any trade agreement between the EU and Britain could not be linked to payment of financial settlements. This bill will amount to approximately ¬£39 billion. During the meeting with the delegation of MPs, which took place in Brussels on 3 September, Barnier described May's White Paper as \\"useful.\\" Also on 7 September, British Finance Minister Philip Hammond stated that he was now \\"sure\\" that a trade deal would be reached by the original October deadline. On 13 September, Raab published a second batch of no-deal Brexit documents, this time containing 80 papers. On 19 September at the EU summit in Salzburg, May reiterated her previous position the EU had to \\"evolve\\" its position concerning the Irish border. === October 2018 === On 4 October 2018, Irish officials announced that Ireland would back May's \\"all UK\\" customs union proposal with the EU. On 5 October, Barnier stated that the post-Brexit EU- Britain trade deal was now \\"very close.\\" On 6 October, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker stated that the post-Brexit trade deal between the EU and Britain was now \\"close.\\" The same day, European Council President Donald Tusk stated that a trade agreement between the EU and Britain would be reached, \\"if not finalized\\", at the EU summit between 17 and 18 October. Juncker also stated that he was optimistic that the trade deal would be agreed to in time for approval at the summit. Irish government sources also issued a statement claiming that a deal over the Irish border was now \\"very close.\\" Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also stated that the deal should be reached \\"sooner rather than later.\\" On 9 October, Raab stated that he was now \\"confident we will reach a deal this autumn.\\" The same day, DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party has the largest number of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, travelled to Brussels and warned EU officials that she would not support any EU backstop proposal which would create greater economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain. On 10 October, Barnier stated that a trade deal at the start of the EU summit on 17 October was now \\"within reach.\\" Despite hinting that a deal would earn early approval \\"if we have the negotiations on October 17\\", Barnier still insisted that a customs union would prevent border checks at the Irish border. The trade deal was also welcomed by Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, though each also stressed caution until its details were published. The EU also cancelled plans to publish its version of documents pertaining to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The same day, Britain's FCA published more documents pertaining to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. On 11 October, The Daily Telegraph reported that the EU and Britain had made further concessions and agreed to an \\"all-UK\\" backstop at the Irish border which will have \\"no time limit.\\" The same day, EU and British diplomats involved the negotiations stated that a trade deal was now expected by 15 October. May also informed members of her cabinet that a \\"historic\\" Brexit deal was now \\"close.\\" One official who was familiar with the meeting backed the Prime Minister's claim and stated that a trade deal agreement between Britain and the EU was \\"practically done.\\" Despite the progress which was made in achieving a compromise over the Irish border, May, addressing concerns from the DUP, later spoke with reporters from Northern Ireland and stated that talks concerning the backstop would still continue until November. Barnier also made another concession and offered to allow Britain's stay in the EU customs union to be only \\"temporary\\" and suggested Britain should continue to apply the EU's external tariffs. On 14 October, a spokeswoman for Britain's Brexit ministry announced progress \\"in a number of key areas\\", but acknowledged that the British government will still not support a backstop at the Irish border. Barnier, who held surprise talks with Raab, stated \\"some issues are still open.\\" The EU Ambassadors from all the other 27 EU nations were summoned to Brussels as well. It has also been agreed that talks will not resume until the start of the EU summit on 17 October. Also during this day, EU and British diplomats completed negotiating a draft post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the EU. However, May and Raab rejected this proposed trade deal due to terms which were written regarding the Irish border backstop. On 15 October, May stated that the British government's difference with the EU now \\"aren't far apart\\", but that the EU now had to terminate plans for a backstop at the Irish border. On 16 October May's cabinet officially backed her Brexit strategy. The same day, French President Emmanuel Macron, who is considered to have taken the most hardline stance in the Brexit negotiations, made a concession and offered to support a \\"temporary\\" backstop at the Irish border. Before departing for the EU summit on 17 October, May stated to reporters that \\"now is the time\\" for the deal and that she was also confident that it would move forward at some point \\"with the full package.\\" The same day, Varadkar announced a major concession over the backstop, agreeing to make it only temporary, if a permanent solution was agreed that would ensure no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Varadkar also stated that he wished to preserve current trade relations with Britain and hinted that another summit would be held in November. The Polish government, which has broken ranks with several other EU governments to support Britain's Brexit stance, also warned other EU leaders not to \\"play with fire.\\" During the summit, May rejected another drafted trade deal offered by the EU which would have extended the transition period, due to the fact that it would've resulted in adding around ¬£5bn to the ¬£39bn \\"divorce bill.\\" On the first day, 17 October, May met with Macron, Varadkar, Tusk and Juncker and also delivered a 30-minute speech to all 27 EU leaders. Following her speech, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani stated \\"the tone was more relaxed than in Salzburg, undoubtedly. There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs May.\\" EU leaders also cancelled their plans to hold an extraordinary summit in November due to lack of progress. On 18 October, Spain reached an agreement with Britain and agreed to no longer hold any objection to the nearby British coastal peninsula of Gibraltar leaving the EU with Britain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez even stated \\"Gibraltar will no longer be a problem in arriving at a Brexit deal.\\" Any dispute between Britain and Spain over the status of Gibraltar will also no longer affect a potential trade agreement between Britain and the EU. On 21 October, it was reported that trade negotiations between Britain and the EU were now 95% complete and that May had managed to not only resolve the issue surrounding Gibraltar's EU departure, but had also managed to develop a protocol concerning the UK's military presence in Cyprus and agreed to a mechanism for resolving any future disputes with the EU. On 22 October May confirmed this during a speech in the House of Commons. The British Prime Minister also laid the four elements related to the remaining 5% which remained unresolved, all of which are related to the Irish border. On 22 October, Reuters reported that EU sources had told them the EU was \\"looking at ways to promise Britain a customs deal that could stretch Brussels‚Äô Brexit red lines but might break a deadlock over the Irish border.\\" On 23 October, EU sources informed the Irish RT√â news agency that the EU had made another concession and agreed to a separate treaty ensuring a \\"UK-wide\\" customs union which is not \\"Northern Ireland-only.\\" This customs union proposal, which May claimed would further preserve the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which resulted in the implementation of the Northern Ireland peace process, was one of the four steps which the British Prime Minister proposed for breaking the Irish border impasse. When asked if this offer by the EU guaranteed a trade deal, May's spokesman stated that more needs to be done and that \\"any circumstance in which Northern Ireland could be in a separate customs territory to the UK is unacceptable.\\" The Business Times reported that May was now optimistic that the negotiations for the trade deal would be wrapped up by the end of November. A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street also denied media reports that her Cabinet has been engaged in a \\"row\\" over her proposal to end the impasse over the Irish border and that there was merely an \\"impassioned\\" agreement that there should be a guarantee of no indefinite extension of the customs union. On 24 October, May confirmed to reporters that there was now a proposal to extend the transition period \\"by a matter of months.\\" However, May also stated that this proposal \\"is not expected to be used.\\" Leaked papers also revealed that May wanted an agreement from her Cabinet on the next phase of negotiations by the following week and that the proposal was at best a one- year extension of the transition period. Tusk afterwards stated \\"if the UK decided that such an extension would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively.\\" Tusk also stated that the proposal, which May only considers to be an option if needed, was originally brought up May during discussions at the October EU Summit. The prevention of an indefinite customs union and assurance from the EU that it an extension would only be an option were two of the four steps which May cited to the end Irish border impasse as well. On 31 October, a letter dated 24 October was published revealed that Raab stated to at least one lawmaker that a trade deal would be finalised by the European Union by 21 November and that the end of negotiations was now \\"firmly in sight\\" According to Raab, the Prime Minister's four points regarding Northern Ireland were the only issues that still needed to be resolved by this point in time. === November 2018 === On 8 November 2018, it was announced that the EU had made concessions and offered a \\"level playing field\\" post-Brexit trade deal if Britain were to agree to the backstop. In a press conference, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt stated that he was \\"optimistic\\" that the planned November EU special summit which had been cancelled at the October summit would now take place before the end of November. It was acknowledged differences still remained over the lifespan of this new offer. On 12 November, Barnier stated that the Brexit deal was almost ready, but still needed political endorsement. Barnier also said that the text would be presented to May's Cabinet on 13 November. The Prime Minister's office denied that May was ready to accept the EU's latest offer. May later delivered a televised speech where she declared that \\"the negotiations for our departure are now in the endgame\\" and insisted that she still would not accept a trade deal which hampered Britain's border and economic sovereignty. On 13 November 2018, the UK government and EU agreed on the text of the proposed withdrawal agreement. On 14 November, following a five-hour Cabinet meeting, May announced that her Cabinet approved the draft agreement. On the same day the government published Explainer for the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union, stating that negotiations on the future UK-EU were ongoing and that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be signed without an agreed Political Declaration on the future relationship \\"on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\\".HM Government Explainer (for the withdrawal agreemen) 14 November 2018 Also on 14 November, the text of the withdrawal agreement was published. The proposed agreement includes a financial settlement expected to be at least ¬£39bn, and sets forth a transition period lasting until 31 December 2020, but which could be extended for at most two years. During the transition period, UK would be required to comply with EU law, while not being a member of any of its institutions. On the Irish border question, the proposed agreement contains a \\"backstop\\", that would come into force if no long-term trade deal is reached before the end of the transition period. The rights to residence and social security rights would be retained by EU citizens in UK and UK citizens in EU. The withdrawal agreement would be governed by a joint UK-EU arbitration panel. A social media campaign was launched by Number 10 Downing Street to convince the public of the deal. On 15 November 2018, Tusk stated that a new summit would be on 25 November 2018 for EU and that a meeting to discuss preparations for this summit would be held on 20 November. On 17 November 2018 May wrote in The Sun that the proposed deal would end both free movement of people and ECJ rule over Britain, and also protect millions of British jobs. She stated that the November EU summit would go ahead as scheduled. On 18 November, May told Sky News that she would attend a meeting in Brussels during the next week. On 19 November, EU ministers endorsed the draft agreement. The same day, the deal was endorsed by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). On 20 November 2018, the deal was endorsed by the Bank of England. On 21 November, May travelled to Brussels to hold a meeting with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46284310 and the European Commission released a statement The Commission released a statement that stated that \\"very good progress\\" had been made during this meeting. Juncker also cancelled a planned two-day trip to the Canary Islands in order to work with \\"the many important events taking place at the moment.\\" Commission Vice- President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the \\"sherpas\\" ‚Äì officials tasked with doing the detailed work ahead of summits ‚Äì are scheduled to meet on 23 November to work on the final texts of the withdrawal agreement and the future relationship. On 22 November, European Council President Donald Tusk announced the European Commission's approval of the draft agreement, thus paving the way for the summit which concerns the European Council vote. Tusk also sent a political declaration regarding future EU relations with Britain to the EU27 states and called on their ruling governments to draft it.Draft Political Declaration setting out the Framework for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK European Council, 22 November 2018 On 22 November, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez tweeted, following a phone conversation with May over Gibraltar at Juncker's encouragment, that Britain and Spain still remained \\"far apart.\\"Why Spain is unhappy about the Brexit deal for Gibraltar ITV, 22 November 2018 Nevertheless, May stated that she was still \\"confident\\" that she and S√°nchez \\"will be able to agree a deal that delivers for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.\\" On 23 November 2018, the sherpas met, though the dispute with Spain over the issue of Gibraltar ensured that May's meeting with Juncker on 24 November will involve resolving the issue in person. Despite new threats from S√°nchez of a veto to the trade deal, it has also been acknowledged, including by Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, that Spain will have no such power at 25 November summit and that any objection at this summit would merely be a sign of EU disunity. It was also acknowledged that Spain's main dispute with Britain was not Gibraltar's departure from the EU with Britain or future trade deals with Britain, but rather that Britain agree to exclude Gibraltar in future negotiations not related to the Gibraltar dispute. The same day, the sherpas agreed a third Brexit document concerning level playing fields with regards to competition with British companies and use of UK fisheries. On 24 November, Tusk announced that an agreement had been brokered between Britain and Spain and over the Gibraltar dispute and that the dispute will not cancel the upcoming summit. S√°nchez confirmed this and also stated that Spain would vote yes on the withdrawal agreement. On 25 November 2018, all of the leaders of the EU27 nations endorsed the Brexit deal at the summit. On 26 November, May announced that the Parliament vote on the deal will be held on 11 December 2018. US President Donald Trump has objected to the deal. On 29 November, the Bank of England's Mark Carney said, with reference to Bank stress tests in event of Brexit, \\"In the disorderly Brexit scenario, the term premium on UK government bond yields rises by 100 bp. And as the sterling risk premium increases, sterling falls by 25%, in addition to the 9% it has already fallen since the May 2016 Inflation Report.\\" === December 2018 === The House of Lords report published on 5 December 2018, analysing the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and the accompanying Political Declaration,\\"Brexit:The Withdrawal Agreement and the accompanying Political Declaration\\" HL Paper 245, 5 December 2018. expressed concern (in para.24) about the wide power that Article 164 would give the Joint UK-EU Committee to be established as the primary forum responsible for implementation and application ‚Äì including any decision on extending the transition period (para.140) ‚Äì and about the Committee's lack of decision making transparency (paras. 36, 37, 136); and concern about the \\"Irish backstop\\" (p. 27 \\"Institutional oversight of the Protocol\\"). On 10 December, after the government's proposal received a hostile response in the House of Commons debate, mainly, but not only, concerning the Irish backstop that critics feared could continue indefinitely without UK being able to withdraw from it unilaterally, May called off the next day's House of Commons vote on the proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement, saying it \\"would be rejected by a significant margin\\" if voted on then. The following day, May held meetings with Merkel, Rutte, Tusk and Juncker to try re-negotiate the deal. However, Merkel said that the deal could not be renegotiated.

Negotiations took place between the United Kingdom and the European Union during 2017 and 2018 for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union following the referendum held on 23 June 2016. In March 2019, UK prime minister Theresa May and EU leaders negotiated a fortnight's delay for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to ratify the Brexit withdrawal agreement, moving the date from 29 March 2019 to 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, a further half-year extension was agreed between the UK and the EU27 at the EU summit, until 31 October 2019. At the time of the second extension, the EU position was that the negotiation of terms for withdrawal ended in November 2018 and that the extension is to give the UK Parliament more time to consider the agreement. Negotiations during 2019 have been primarily within the UK Parliament on whether to accept the Theresa May government's negotiated settlement, to leave the EU without an agreement, or to abandon Brexit. In July, the newly assembled Boris Johnson ministry declared intention to re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, with the Irish backstop removed as a pre-condition. UK and EU negotiators met for the first time on 28 August and meetings \\"will continue twice a week\\". Fresh proposals were released by the Johnson ministry in October, which the EU dismissed as unworkable. In October 2019, following bilateral talks between Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the UK and EU agreed to a revised deal, which replaced the backstop. The Benn Act, passed by the UK parliament in September, required the prime minister to seek a further extension in the event that by 19 October, parliament has not given its consent to either a deal, in a \\"meaningful vote\\", or a no-deal Brexit. On 28 October 2019, the date was moved back to 2020.Brexit: Johnson agrees to Brexit extension ‚Äì but urges election BBC News 28 October 2019 Following the 2019 UK general election, which resulted in a landslide victory for Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, the withdrawal agreement is expected to be ratified by both the UK and EU before Exit Day, on 31 January 2020. ==Timeline== === January 2019 === On 15 January 2019, the House of Commons voted against the deal put forward by May's government by 432 votes against to 202 votes for. Shortly afterwards, the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, tabled a motion of no confidence in the government, a vote which was won by the Government by a margin of 325 to 306. Following the confidence vote, Corbyn voiced opposition to entering talks with the Government on Brexit, until May had ruled out the option of a no-deal Brexit. On 17 January, May rejected this offer, stating that ruling out a \\"no-deal\\" Brexit would be \\"impossible\\". On 28 January 2019, May expressed opposition to the backstop that she and the EU had agreed to and urged Conservative MPs to back a backbench amendment asking for the backstop to be replaced by an unspecified \\"alternative arrangement\\". On 29 January, this proposal, which was presented by MP Graham Brady, passed in the House of Commons by a margin of 317 votes to 301 votes. The House of Commons had also agreed to reject a no-deal Brexit in principle only, and also rejected other proposed amendments which would have given Parliament the power to extend Article 50 and block a no-deal Brexit. Following the vote, Corbyn met with May and it was agreed that if May were able to successfully renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, another vote would be held on 13 February 2019. It was also agreed that May would return to Brussels for more talks. === February 2019 === On 2 February 2019, the Prime Minister announced during a meeting in Brussels that the Leader of the Opposition had agreed to back a Brexit agreement which ensures that the Irish border backstop was not permanent. On 7 February 2019, May held another meeting in Brussels and it was agreed that more talks would occur by the end of the month, despite the fact Juncker repeated previous claims that the EU would not reopen negotiations. It was also suggested that another House of Commons vote on the EU withdrawal agreement would be delayed and not occur until the end of March. On 24 February, May confirmed that the vote, which had been slated to take place on 27 February, would be delayed to 12 March and that a new Brexit deal was now \\"within grasp.\\" On 27 February 2019, the Commons voted overwhelmingly to make mandatory a Government timetable beginning 12 March that would give MPs the right to approve or reject the Government's draft agreement, or to accept or reject a \\"no deal\\" Brexit, or to extend (or not) the Article 50 deadline. === March 2019 === Following negotiations between May and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg, France, they announced on 11 March 2019 a new agreement who gave legally binding reassurances of the temporary nature of the proposed backstop. No changes were made to the actual withdrawal agreement, however, but it was supplemented by a parallel agreement. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar backed the new agreement as well. Following this, UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox updated his legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, stating that the new agreement made \\"significant reductions in [the] risk\\" that UK would be trapped in the backstop, but that the UK was still not able to unilaterally leave the backstop. On 12 March, the House of Commons again rejected the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, voting against it by 391 to 242. Immediately after the vote, May announced to the House that she would bring forward a motion declining to approve leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and a framework on the future relationship, for debate and vote in the House the next day (13 March). On 13 March, the House voted against leaving the EU without a deal by 321 votes to 278. The vote also amended the government motion by specifying that a no-deal Brexit would be ruled out at any time. Immediately after the vote, May announced to the House that she would bring forward a motion on extending the Article 50 negotiating period, for debate and vote in the House the next day (14 March). On 14 March, the government motion was passed by 412 votes to 202. Four amendments were put forward, but all of these failed to pass. This meant that Prime Minister May would request an extension to Article 50 at the European Council on 21‚Äì22 March. Initially, there were two options. If the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration were passed before 20 March in a third meaningful vote, May would request a short extension until 30 June to prepare for an orderly withdrawal. If the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration failed to pass for a third time, May would request a longer extension, probably beyond 30 June. However, EU leaders and officials made clear that the latter option would require the UK to hold European elections in May since the new European Parliament will first convene on 1 July. In addition, the UK government would have to come up with a different negotiating strategy, such that a deal would be reached which the House of Commons could support. However, May's first option was blocked. On 18 March, the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, announced that parliamentary procedure prevented the government from bringing substantially the same Withdrawal Agreement to vote again in the same legislative session. Only if it were amended in substance, as occurred between 15 January and 12 March votes, could it be brought forward again. In a speech in Downing St on 20 March, May told the public she was \\"on their side\\", saying \\"Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,\\" said Mrs May. \\"All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want.\\" She proceeded to request an extension until 30 June at the European Council, hoping that her deal could still be passed before 29 March, after the conclusion of the EU summit. For this, the EU27 would have to provide enough changes \\"in substance\\" for Speaker Bercow to allow a third meaningful vote. On 21 March, the European Council (in EU27 composition) endorsed the Instrument relating to the withdrawal agreement and the joint statement supplementing the political declaration. These were the additional reassurances that May agreed with Juncker on 11 March. The EU27 hoped that this would suffice to convince enough British MP's to vote in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement. If this third meaningful vote succeeded, the EU would grant the UK an extension until 22 May (the day before the European elections on 23‚Äì26 May), to prepare for an orderly withdrawal. If it failed, the EU27 would allow May to come up with a new Brexit plan by 12 April. According to President of the European Council Donald Tusk, \\"all options will remain open\\", until that date. In a letter to all MP's, May spelled out these options: 1) passing her deal (which she preferred); 2) leaving without a deal on 12 April; 3) revoking Article 50; 4) requesting a longer extension before 12 April. On 27 March, the House of Commons held a series of indicative votes on alternatives to May's deal. However, these did not produce a majority for any of the tabled options. On 29 March, the original exit date, the House of Commons once again voted against the withdrawal agreement; albeit by a smaller margin than in the previous two votes (286‚Äì344). President Tusk immediately called an emergency European Council, to be held on 10 April. This gave the House of Commons the time to come up with a new Brexit plan through indicative votes, starting on 1 April. The government promised to consider the outcome of these votes as the basis for her negotiating stance at the emergency summit. The UK is expected to forward her position to the EU27 in advance, to give the twenty-seven member states enough time to formulate their response ahead of the summit. If this new plan were to involve a long extension, beyond 30 June, the British would be required to participate in the European elections; and the House of Commons would have to make that decision on or before 12 April. If the House has not decided this by then, there will under no condition be a further extension beyond 30 June. === April 2019 === On 1 April 2019, the second round of indicative votes did not produce a majority for any of the tabled proposals. Following a cabinet meeting the next day, Prime Minister May called for a bipartisan agreement on changes to the Political Declaration governing the future relationship; a move welcomed by Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn. Labour's preferred future relationship would be a permanent customs union, a close security partnership and close regulatory alignment with the single market, especially in the domains of worker's rights, consumer protection and environmental standards; as well as continuous freedom of movement. If Corbyn and May failed to reach a compromise, they would put a number of options to another round of parliamentary votes. May would then use the outcome of either process as the basis for requesting another short extension to Article 50, preferably until 22 May, to avoid participation in the European elections. This would mark the first time in the whole Brexit process that the Prime Minister would consider either bipartisan agreements or parliamentary votes as a binding mandate. On 2 April, two deals between the UK, Norway and Iceland were signed, to safeguard important rights for Norwegian / Icelandic citizens in the UK, and British citizens in Norway and Iceland, and continued trade in goods between the countries, in case the UK leaves the EU without an agreement.To brexit-avtaler med Storbritannia undertegnet 2 April 2019 On 5 April, May sent a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk asking to extend the Brexit deadline until 30 June. In return, May pledged to make preparations for the European Parliament elections, in the event that a longer extension was needed. These preparations could be cancelled at any time, if the UK were to leave before 23 May, the first day of the elections. In response to May's letter, Tusk proposed a \\"flexible extension\\" of one year. Such a \\"flextension\\" would require (preparations for) UK participation in the European elections, but could be annulled at any time, once the withdrawal agreement had been ratified. Given that the withdrawal agreement is unlikely to pass the House of Commons any time soon, according to Tusk, a short extension would only create a never- ending series of delays, cliff-edges and emergency summits. Tusk also stressed the fact that the UK still had the option to remain, by unilaterally revoking Article 50. Meanwhile, EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier expressed an openness to the idea of a permanent customs union between the UK and the EU. But in the case of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would first have to accept the three demands of the EU27 which have been at the heart of the negotiations to the Withdrawal Agreement: the budget contributions, the citizens' rights and the Irish border. Only then could the talks on the future relationship, and thus a customs union, begin. This demand fell in line with one of the EU27's most consistent red lines: that the negotiations on the UK's withdrawal shall be finished before the negotiations on the future relationship could begin. This view was echoed by the EU27. There would be no negotiations on the future relationship, nor on the withdrawal agreement. The only thing that could change in substance during the extension period was the Political Declaration. The EU27 also demanded that the UK would not sabotage EU decision making in the event of a flextension. Prime Minister May, for her part, went to the EU summit without a bipartisan deal on an amended Political Declaration. This raised concern among EU leaders, who demanded clarity from the UK on what purpose another extension would serve. French president Emmanuel Macron seemed particularly sceptical about the prospect of a longer extension, partly driven by fear that the ongoing Brexit negotiations would divert attention away from his ambitious plans for further European integration, and give the UK the possibility to try and veto this reform agenda. German chancellor Angela Merkel countered this by stressing the importance of an orderly withdrawal, something which a longer extension could facilitate. At 10 April 2019 emergency EU summit, the European Council agreed to a compromise between May's/Macron's short extension and Tusk's/Merkel's longer flextension. The Brexit deadline will be delayed until 31 October 2019, with the option of an earlier withdrawal on the first day of the next month following ratification of the withdrawal agreement. At the regular European Council on 20‚Äì21 June 2019, there will be a review to \\"assess the situation\\". 31 October as the new exit date erases the need to appoint a new British Commissioner, and excludes the UK from participation in the drafting of new legislative proposals, since the next European Commission is scheduled to take office on 1 November 2019. The UK has to make preparations for the European elections. If the ratification process has not been finalised by 22 May, then the UK will be required to actually elect new MEPs between 23 and 26 May or leave the EU without a deal on 1 June. In addition, the European Council conclusions and decision also incorporated the other demands by the EU27 as outlined above: no sabotage of EU decision making by the UK; no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement; and no negotiations on the future relationship, except for the political declaration. Finally, the Council conclusions stressed the fact that the option of remain is still open to the UK. === May 2019 === On 14 May 2019, Theresa May's government announced that the House of Commons would vote on the Withdrawal Agreement for the fourth time in the week commencing 3 June 2019. However, this time it would not just be a meaningful vote, but a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) itself. On 17 May 2019, the bipartisan talks on an amended political declaration between Tory and Labour broke down. On 21 May 2019, prime minister May announced a couple of concessions, hoping that these would persuade enough MP's, from both Tory and Labour, to back the Withdrawal Agreement. Among these concessions were a mandatory vote on whether to attach a second referendum to the WAB, as well as a temporary customs union with the EU that only included goods and would give the UK influence over relevant EU trade policy. However, her plea was almost immediately met with fierce criticism from both major parties. This backlash prompted May to cancel the vote on the WAB, two days after she had announced her concessions; although the WAB will still be published in the week commencing 3 June. That same day, 23 May 2019, European elections were held in the UK. On 24 May 2019, Theresa May announced her resignation, that she would step down as leader of the Conservative Party on 7 June, and once a new Tory leader is selected, she would also resign as Prime Minister. On 26‚Äì27 May 2019, the results of the European elections were announced. The Brexit Party led with 30.74% of the votes and 29 MEPs, followed by the Liberal Democrats with 19.75% and 16 MEPs. Together, Remain-supporting parties received more votes than Hard-Brexit- backing parties. The Conservatives and Labour saw a significant drop in support, with the Conservatives on 8.84% and 4 MEPs, and Labour on 13.72% and 10 MEPs. === June 2019 === On 7 June 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party. Her resignation kicked off the campaign for her succession. After a five-round ballot among the 313 Tory MP's, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were selected as the two candidates for the membership vote (voting was restricted to members of the Conservative Party). === July 2019 === The voting closed on 22 July 2019, with the results announced on 23 July 2019. Boris Johnson was elected leader with 92,153 votes (66%) against Jeremy Hunt's 46,656 votes (34%). During his election campaign, Johnson said: \\"After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31st. We must do better than the current Withdrawal Agreement that has been rejected three times by Parliament ‚Äî and let me clear that I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome. I don't think that we will end up with any such thing. But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously for no deal. Indeed, it is astonishing that anyone could suggest dispensing with that vital tool of negotiation.\\" Johnson also warned of \\"catastrophic consequences for voter trust in politics\\" if the government pushed the EU for further delays. He advocated removing the Irish backstop from any Withdrawal Agreement and replacing it with \\"alternative arrangements\\", and promised to withhold the ¬£39 billion \\"divorce payment\\" (previously agreed contributions and pension commitments) \\"until greater clarity emerges\\". However, almost immediately after his royal appointment as Prime Minister on 24 July 2019, EU officials reiterated once more that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, could not be renegotiated; only the Political Declaration could be amended, if Johnson's government were to formulate a new position on the future relationship. In response, Johnson said that he would not start negotiations with the EU27 unless the EU27 changed its red line on the backstop. Because of this stalemate, suspicion rose that preparing for a no- deal Brexit was actually Johnson's number one priority; as opposed to plan B, to be activated if plan A (a renegotiated Withdrawal Agreement) failed. Some EU diplomats even said that Johnson was not interested in any more negotiations. === August 2019 === On 28 August 2019, after months of speculation and hints, Prime Minister Boris Johnson requested the prorogation of Parliament. On the advice of the Privy Council, Queen Elizabeth II granted this request, despite fierce criticism by opposition parties, some Tory MP's, constitutional experts, protesters and Speaker John Bercow. Parliament was to be prorogued for five weeks commencing 9 September 2019, and the new session would start on 14 October 2019 (with a Queen's Speech). The latter date was three days before the European Council on 17‚Äì18 October 2019, and two-and-a- half weeks before the scheduled Brexit date of 31 October 2019. Given this short time-span, Johnson's parliamentary and extra-parliamentary opponents suspected its primary purpose was to prevent Parliament from stopping a no- deal Brexit. MPs opposed to no-deal had been trying to coordinate their actions, which would take the form of either legislation requiring the Prime Minister to request a third extension at the European Council, or a motion of no confidence in the government. As of 29 August, three court proceedings against prorogation were lodged, and one European legal proceeding has begun: * In the Court of Session, Edinburgh, for breach of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, by 75 MPs led by Joanna Cherry; * In the High Court of Justice, Westminster, for an urgent judicial review on the legality of the use of the royal prerogative, by Gina Miller; * In the High Court, Northern Ireland, for breach of the Good Friday Agreement, by Raymond McCord; * In the European Parliament, for breach of Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, under the process outlined under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. === September 2019 === On 24 September the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled unanimously that Boris Johnson's decision to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament was unlawful, and that the prorogation itself was therefore null and of no effect. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 became law on 9 September 2019, requiring the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date should he not be able to agree a withdrawal agreement with the European Union and obtain approval from the House of Commons for it by 19 October 2019. === October 2019 === On 2 October the Government published a fresh Brexit plan, which included proposals to replace the Irish backstop. It would create an \\"all-island regulatory zone\\", meaning that Northern Ireland would essentially stay in the European Single Market for agricultural and industrial goods, meaning that sanitary and phytosanitary controls would be needed between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The proposal also declared that Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK, would leave the Customs Union, meaning that customs controls would be needed for cross-border goods trade. The proposal did not appear to address cross-border services. On 4 October the Government assured the highest civil court in Scotland that Johnson would send a letter to the EU seeking an extension to Article 50 as required by the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. The court was originally due to release their ruling on 9 October, but decided to delay doing so until 21 October, to allow the court to \\"assess how circumstances have changed\\". On 10 October, Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar held \\"very positive and very promising\\" talks that led to a resumption in negotiations, and a week later, on 17 October, Johnson and Jean- Claude Juncker announced that they had reached agreement (subject to ratification) on a new Withdrawal Agreement which replaced the backstop with a new protocol on Northern Ireland/Republic of Ireland. On 19 October, a special Saturday sitting of Parliament was held to debate the revised agreement. MPs passed an amendment by 322 votes to 306 that withholds Parliament's approval until legislation implementing the deal has been passed, and forces the Government to request a delay to Brexit until 31 January 2020. Later that evening, 10 Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson would send a letter to the EU requesting an extension, but would not sign it. EU Council President Donald Tusk subsequently confirmed receipt of the letter, which Johnson had described as \\"Parliament's letter, not my letter\\". In addition, Johnson sent a second letter expressing the view that any further delay to Brexit would be a mistake. On 22 October, the UK government brought the revised EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons for debate. MPs voted on the Bill itself, which was passed by 329 votes to 299, and the timetable for debating the Bill, which was defeated by 322 votes to 308. Prior to the votes, Johnson had stated that if his timetable failed to generate the support needed to pass in parliament he would abandon attempts to get the deal approved and would seek a general election. Following the vote, however, Johnson announced that the legislation would be paused while he consulted with other EU leaders. On 28 October 2019, it was confirmed Brexit had been delayed until 31 January 2020. The following day, MPs backed a general election on 12 December 2019. On 30 October 2019, the day named as \\"exit day\\" in UK legislation was changed to 31 January 2020 at 11.00 pm.The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30 October 2019. ==See also== *Brexit negotiations in 2017 *Brexit negotiations in 2018 *2019 in the United Kingdom *2010s in United Kingdom political history * Trade negotiation between the UK and the EU ==References== ==External links== * UK Parliament ‚Äì Brexit News * Gov.UK ‚Äì Department for Exiting the European Union * UK Government ‚Äì \\"Plan for Britain\\" website * Europa (EU official website) ‚Äì UK ‚Äì Brexit ‚Äì overview * European Commission ‚Äì Brexit negotiations website * European Commission ‚Äì list of published negotiating documents * European Commission ‚Äì Preparedness notices * Brexit, EC, CEU Timeline and list of key documents for Brexit negotiations * The Principle of Loyalty in EU Law, 2014, by Marcus Klamert, Legal Officer, European Commission * Resource page and commentary by David Allen Green * Exchange Rates UK ‚Äì Brexit Timeline With Chart for Impact on Pound Sterling * Explanatory Memorandum for the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 introduced by the Irish government in the legislature (Oireachtas) * EU Council decision, 22 March 2019, extending the negotiating period Negotiation Category:Negotiation Category:2019 in the European Union Category:2019 in British politics Category:Membership treaties of the European Union Category:Disaster preparedness Category:2019-related timelines Category:Political timelines by year ","title":"Brexit negotiations in 2019"},{"id":"60301253","text":"The Mbanja worm lizard (Chirindia ewerbecki), also known commonly as Ewerbeck's round-headed worm lizard, is a species of amphisbaenian in the family Amphisbaenidae.

It is a smooth disk coral whose shape usually consists of a flat, concave form (patellate) or an inverted cone form. However, a cylindrical shape may occur. They have a maximum diameter of 10 cm and have a symbiotic bond with zooxanthellae. Despite this, S. cubensis do not create their own reefs. Their colors normally consist of light green, light beige or a deep rusty red. == Distribution == S. cubensis live on the coasts of Bermuda and Jamaica. In Bermuda they are typically situated on reefs and platforms; 6 meters to 62 meters below the surface of the water. In Jamaica, they exist on sandy channels between reefs and on muddy slopes close to river mouths. S. cubensis prefer to be in areas where sunlight can‚Äôt reach. They grow more abundantly at low latitudes and on hard substrates and are seen to be more active in warm tropical waters during the warm summer months. == Description == Their skeletal structure is constructed of layers of septa that surround the core of the organism. The first layer around the core consists of septa plates that are thick in diameter; 6 septa in total. The second layer around the coral is thinner when compared to the first layer and consists of 7 or more septa overlaying the first layer. Those of the third and so on will vary in thickness as the coral continues to grow. S. cubensis can have 104 to 112 septa in total that surrounding their core. S. cubensis have rough costae that are covered in spines, and a \\"spongy trabecular columellae\\". They have non- aggressive polyps which makes them vulnerable to aggressive species of coral and have been seen to grow more horizontally than vertically. == Reproduction == The species reproduces sexually by broadcast spawning. S. cubensis does not own a strong intraspecific \\"immune-recognition system\\", which allows them to fuse with themselves. After fertilization, the new larva floats in open water and eventually lands on a reef deposit. If this larvae lands close enough to another adult S. cubensis they have a high probability to fuse together as the larval S. cubensis grows. When S. cubensis fuse they form a common calcareous deposit in between them. This results in di- or tri corallites or corals that are made of two or three S. cubensis corals all fused together. The subunits are genetically different as a result of the sexual reproduction but can still fuse together as if they are the same individual. == Behavior == === Self- Management === S. cubensis like to settle on reefs that have steep angles to more easily dispose of sediments that get caught around their oral disks. They get rid of the build-up of sediments by using their mucus strands along with water currents to congregate the sediments to edge of their oral disc. Once at the edge of the oral disc, their mouth will periodically ungulate or move in and out to shake off the sediments. The sediments when being gathered for disposal are moved downward towards the part of the oral disc that is most downslope; so they also have the assistance of gravity to help them out. This action is easier for corals that are aligned at a steep angle than corals that are aligned horizontally. === Competition === In Jamaica, S. cubensis engage in interspecific aggression with Scolymia lacera over light and space but are outcompeted by the latter. The S. lacera are able to kill the tissue of S. cubensis by an ‚Äúextracoelenteric feeding response‚Äù. When the polyps of S. lacera come in contact to S. cubensis they are able to destroy and eat the tissue of the S. cubensis coral; eventually exposing its skeleton and killing it. This aggression can persist even in extreme cases of starvation and lack of sunlight. Despite this S. cubensis are considered to be the 9th most aggressive species of coral in Jamaica. == References == Category:Mussidae ","title":"Scolymia cubensis"},{"id":"60301318","text":"The 1983 Louisville Cardinals football team represented the University of Louisville in the 1983 NCAA Division I-A football season.

Though he converted to Russian Orthodoxy at an early age, Shapiro nonetheless retained lifelong ties to Judaism, Zionism, and his mitnagedic roots, themes of which featured prominently in his poetry. He was described by Yeshurun Keshet as \\"a poet of the national legend, the first author of the ballad in Hebrew literature.\\" ==Biography== ===Early life=== Constantin Shapiro was born to a religious Jewish family in Grodno, where he received a traditional yeshiva education. He began writing secular poetry in his youth, much to the consternation of his father, who used all means to prevent him from following the path of the Haskalah. His parents married him off at the age of 15, but the marriage was shortly annulled. He eventually left his hometown for Bia≈Çystok and Vienna, and from there to St. Petersburg in 1868 to enter the Academy of Art, which he left after a short time to learn photography. Shapiro fell gravely ill with typhus, at which time he found out that his Russian girlfriend was pregnant. Fearing his imminent passing, he married her and was baptised so that she and her baby would not be tainted. Shapiro's deep sense of guilt for converting to Christianity would later feature prominently in his writing. ===Photography=== Shapiro became the personal photographer of many prominent Russian officials, including members of the royal family. He was a close friend of Fyodor Dostoevsky, and also photographed Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov, and other leading Russian writers. Shapiro recorded performances by Vasilii Andreev-Burlak for a photo series devoted to Nikolai Gogol's short story Diary of a Madman, published as an album in 1883. An early attempt to capture a performance sequence, each photograph corresponded to a moment in the context of the monologue. Shapiro's exhibitions at the All- Russia Exhibitions of 1870 and 1882 were met with great approbation, and in 1880 his work appeared in the St. Petersburg Portrait Gallery of Russian Writers, Scientists and Actors. He was awarded a Silver Medal by Emperor Alexander II in 1883. ===Literary career=== In the 1870s, Shapiro began holding a regular literary salon at his home and writing poetry for the Hebrew papers and magazines. His first published poem, \\"Me-·∏§ezyonot Bat 'Ammi\\" ('From the Visions of the Daughter of My People', 1884‚Äì1898), at once gained for him a place in the foremost rank of Hebrew poets. His poem \\"David Melekh Yisrael ·∏§ay ve-Kayam\\" ('David, King of Israel Still Lives,' 1884) is considered the first Hebrew poem to present popular traditions in a folk ballad form. This type of poem was subsequently taken up by David Frischmann, Jacob Kahan, and David Shimoni. Following the 1881‚Äì82 pogroms across the Russian Empire, Shapiro became an avowed Zionist and dreamed of going to Eretz Israel. Shapiro's anthology Mi-Shire Yeshurun ('From the Songs of Jeshurun', collected in 1911) contains his most famous poem, \\"\\" ('In the Fields of Bethlehem'), in which Rachel grieves for her sons as she walks up from her grave toward a silent Jordan River. It contains a section in which Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his sons, led by Rachel, all rise from their graves and urge God to end the exile. The poem, set to music by Hanina Karchevsky, became a popular anthem of labour Zionism and the basis for a well-known Israeli folk dance. Other poems of Shapiro include \\"Amarti Yesh Li Tikvah,\\" a translation of Friedrich Schiller's \\"Resignation\\", and \\"Sodom\\", an allegorical description of the Dreyfus affair. He also published \\"Turgenev ve-Sippuro Ha-Yehudi\\", a critical essay on Ivan Turgenev's story The Jew, in Ha-Melitz (1883). ===Death and legacy=== Shapiro died in 1900 in St. Petersburg, leaving several tens of thousands of rubles to the Odessa Committee, which supported Jewish settlements in Palestine of the First Aliyah. His poetry was collected in one volume and published posthumously in 1911 by Ya'akov Fichmann under the title Shirim Niv·∏•arim. ==External links== * Beshadmot Beit-Le·∏•em at the National Library of Israel ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1900 deaths Category:19th-century Russian photographers Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Judaism Category:Hebrew-language poets Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Jewish Russian writers Category:Russian Zionists ","title":"Constantin Shapiro"},{"id":"60301335","text":"Frank Layton Schaub (June 22, 1921 ‚Äì February 23, 1995)Frank L.

At the end of the season, Souths reached their 4th grand final in a row against Western Suburbs. Souths would lose the grand final 22-12 with Spencer playing at centre. The match was remembered due to its controversy with claims the referee George Bishop had put a big wager on Wests winning the game. Souths claimed that they were denied two fair tries and Wests had scored one try off a blatant knock on. In 1953, Spencer joined South Sydney's rivals Eastern Suburbs. In 1954, Spencer captain coached Bellingen in the country rugby league competition. Spencer returned to South Sydney in 1955. Halfway through the season, Souths were given next to no chance of retaining their premiership but the club then managed to win 9 matches in a row including 2 finals games to reach the 1955 NSWRL Grand Final against minor premiers Newtown.

The game is centered around owning and running a workshop which builds and maintains PCs, mainly gaming-oriented ones. It was initially released for early access in March 2018 on Steam. The game is compatible with the Windows operating system, and utilizes the OpenGL programming interface. PC Building Simulator features real life parts from a vast array of specialized brands, such as ADATA, Asus and Asus ROG, Antec, AMD, Arctic Cooling, be quiet!, Cooler Master, Corsair, EVGA, Fractal Design, G.Skill, Gigabyte, MSI, NZXT, Patriot, Razer, SilverStone, ZOTAC, and others. == Gameplay == === Game modes === The game features three modes: Career, Free Build and How to Build a PC, each requiring different play styles. ==== Career ==== In Career mode, the game puts the player in responsibility of a workshop where they must complete tasks that involve modifying pre-built computers, (e.g. removing viruses, adding new parts) or building a brand new computer to earn in-game cash, which can be spent on purchasing new or used parts (see below). After each completed task, the player earns a certain amount of experience points. When a certain amount of experience is reached, the player levels up, unlocking newer and more advanced parts. In order to acquire parts, the player must buy them from fictional online stores, which sell new or used parts. For new parts, the player can choose between different shipping services: the shorter the delivery time, the more cash the player has to pay. The game offers 3 choices: next-day delivery, the standard option which costs 30 dollars; same day delivery, which spawns the parts immediately on the loading bay, but costs 100 dollars; and a slow but cheap delivery which can take from 3 to 5 working days but costs only 10 dollars. Used parts are shipped for free, but they usually take several days or even a couple of weeks to arrive. A calendar tracks the estimated delivery date for each product bought and the deadlines for the customers' orders. As the player progresses, they will start seeing larger sums of cash stored in their banks, which could be spent improving their workshop. Some of the upgrades include additional workbenches (needed to accomplish tasks with more efficiency) and a cabinet (used to store computers and reduce clutter). The player starts the game with a basic computer that can keep up with all the tasks required in order to fulfill the customers' orders. However, as the game progresses, the player can fully customize it (or even build a new one from scratch), either for convenience or mere aesthetics. There is also an optional leaderboard that lists the best PCs built by the other players during their own career. The player must pay the rent for the shop each month, as well as the electricity bill. Failing to do so will result in some hefty debt.  Inbox  The Inbox is where the player receives in-game messages from potential customers, and other messages ranging from discount alerts, to spam and plain scams. The player can accept or reject each request. Potential requests include virus removal, system upgrade, system fix, overclocking, or building of an entirely new personal computer. Depending on the amount of spending required for each request, the customers often always give the player a substantial profit margin. However, after accepting an order, unfulfilled requests are automatically rejected from returning to the customer, meaning that the player cannot simply conduct cash grab by doing nothing with the PC. As the game advances, timed jobs become more common. Being unable to conduct jobs within the limit will result in the customer revoking their order, having the players waste their money by buying unnecessary parts. ==== Free Build ==== In the Free Build mode, the player is given unlimited money, and all the parts, work benches and tools are unlocked from the start. Players are free to play the game without the constraint of constant jobs. ==== How to Build a PC Mode ==== The game provides a detailed tutorial in order to teach a novice how to build a proper PC. ==== Esports Expansion ==== The Esports Expansion DLC features a secondary Career Mode in which the player will provide tech support to several fictional Esports teams and athletes.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252990/PC_Building_Simulator__Esports_Expansion/ Main requests, such as building, fixing and upgrading the gaming rigs, are provided by the team manager using the regular Inbox system; athletes will also ask in-depth requests using a new Smartphone mechanics. In addition to that, the player will have to full fill requests coming from real-life brands that will fictionally sponsor the E sports teams. At the end of each week there will be an e sport match. The player will have to set up the gaming PCs on the stage and, occasionally, solve emergencies in a limited amount of time. After the match, player actions will be evaluated by the team manager, the sponsor and the athletes according to how many requests were successfully fulfilled. Contrary to the standard Career mode, the player will have to operate within a predetermined weekly budget; overspending will affect negatively the weekly evaluation from the team manager. The budget can be increased completing a limited amount of non-mandatory side jobs. === Computer components === The game features many of parts to be used in building or repairing computers. Most of the parts are fully licensed from various real- life brands. There are also three fictional brands, that provides basic (cheap and low performance) parts: Mortoni, for productivity-oriented computers; Shean, for low-budget, Intel-based gaming rigs; and DFL, essentially the AMD- based counterpart for Shean. The game includes common computer components such as: * Cases with different aesthetic and internal layouts. Their sizes include micro, cube, mid-tower, full tower, super tower and open frame. * Case Fans in various sizes. * Intel and AMD CPUs * CPU Cooling devices, including air and liquid coolers. * Motherboards are also available in multiple sizes: E-ATX, S-ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX . * Power Supplies come in ATX or SFX (small form factor) sizes. They are also divided into non-modular, semi-modular or fully modular units. * Storage, which affect in-game software installation speed; both hard drives and solid state drives (SATA and M.2) are available in game. * Memory (RAM) * Graphics Cards (GPUs) from AMD and Nvidia are also featured, with AMD CrossFire and Nvidia SLI multi GPU technologies also being supported in-game. * Cable connectors ==== Software ==== In-game software can be installed to fulfill specific tasks requested by customers, such as removing viruses, customize the case lighting and change the desktop background. The bench-marking software 3DMark is also featured in-game as a key gameplay component; similar to its real-life counterpart, it is used to benchmark the newly built or repaired machines. === Tools and upgrades === Although the installation process is overall simplified compared to real life, the player must use some tools in order to correctly install certain components. For example, installing a CPU cooler without the thermal paste will cause the PC to overheat and fail. There are several upgrades that can ease the PC building, such as self-installing motherboard standoff screws. Said upgrades are unlocked by default in Free Build and Esports modes, but must be unlocked and bought in Career mode and are there to aid in speeding up tasks. == Reception == Robert Adams of TechRaptor gave the game a 6.5/10 rating, calling the game a \\"a partially complete experience\\"; he praised the game for capturing \\"the experience of working as a PC repair technician about 90% correct\\", while noting that it lacked several \\"critical\\" features such as the lack of data preservation/recovery mechanics. == References == == External links == * Category:2019 video games Category:Early access video games Category:Simulation video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Romania Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"PC Building Simulator"},{"id":"60301558","text":"The molecular formula C6H5N3O4 may refer to: * Dinitroanilines ** 2,3-Dinitroaniline ** 2,4-Dinitroaniline ** 2,5-Dinitroaniline ** 2,6-Dinitroaniline ** 3,4-Dinitroaniline ** 3,5-Dinitroaniline ","title":"C6H5N3O4"},{"id":"60301565","text":"Mitrephora calcarea is a species of plant in the family Annonaceae.
