It is dotted with cardamom plantations and tea estates. The mountain range is 1,500 metres above sea level, and it is rich in flora and fauna. The area, now mostly planted with tea plants, includes cloudlands, high wavys, venniar, and the manalar estates belonging to the Woodbriar Group. Access is largely restricted and includes largely untouched remnants of evergreen forest. ==Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary== For a long time, there has been a pending proposal with the Tamil Nadu Forest Department to establish the Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary on 600 km2 of forest in the division. The suggested priority tasks in the sanctuary include: the control of poaching, the use of pesticides for the elimination of ganja (Cannabis sativa) and the cultivation as well as scientific management of watersheds. The Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary can be an excellent buffer to the Periyar Tiger Reserve and Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary which can immensely strengthen the conservation in the southern Western Ghats - the range of hills south of the Palakkad Gap.National Wildlife Data Center (2006) Wildlife Institute of India, retrieved 3/31/2007 List of Proposed Wildlife Sanctuaries in India Wildlife found on the High Wavy Mountains include Oriental honey buzzard, great pied hornbill, Indian brown mongoose, Jerdon's palm civet, white-bellied short- wing, black-naped monarch, pied thrush, gaur, tiger, leopard, Asian elephant, mouse deer, Ghatixalus asterops, Raorchestes beddomii, Raorchestes ponmudi, Nyctibatrachus sp., Ramanella triangularis, Ramanella montana, Calotes grandisquamis, Hemidactylus anamallensis, Salea anamallayana, Kaestlea travancorica, Kaestlea laterimaculata, Uropeltis madurensis, Uropeltis liura, Calliophis nigrescens, large-scaled pit viper and the enigmatic Hutton's pit viper. When the high wavys group of estates were managed by Hindustan Unilever, the company started a non-profit organization called the Megamalai Wildlife and Environment Association. It worked with the forest department to protect the endangered species and safeguard the forest and its creatures; it did so by putting up signs promoting the preservation of nature and animals along the Ghat road of Meghamalai. Unfortunately, most of these signs were destroyed in an expansion project that took place on the Ghat road. The forest department has put new signs to replace the damaged ones.https://www.unilever.com/Images/es_2003_tea-a-popular- beverage_tcm244-409725_en.pdf. ==Flora== According to the experts the last extensive study of flora in the biodiversity-rich, Meghamalai have been conducted in the early 1980s. Since then, no comprehensive research has been done on the vegetation. Vegetation ranges from scrub forests at the foothills, ubiquitous expanses of tea and coffee estates, to spice (pepper, cardamom, cinnamon) plantations and finally to the dense evergreen forests at the top. ==Fauna== Meghamalai forest area hosts a variety of birds, mammals, reptiles and butterflies. Resident and migratory elephants are also common. There are hundreds of identified species: ===Wildlife of Vellimalai=== * Spotted deer * Spotted dove * Barking deer * Sambar deer * Mousedeer * Grizzled giant squirrel * Indian flying fox * Indian giant squirrel * Indian giant flying squirrel * Pied thrush * Black bulbul * RedEye * Black baza * White-bellied woodpecker * White-bellied drongo * Drongo cuckoo * Black-naped oriole * Black-naped monarch * Black-naped hare * Tiger * Dhole * Great pied hornbill * Malabar pied hornbill * Oriental honey-buzzard * Dusky palm squirrel * Bison ==Tourist attractions== Magamalai-180 panoramic view ===Tea estates and dams=== The Highwavys provide a view of the entire mountain range of Varusanadu Hills. There are large private tea, spices, and coffee plantations all around, notably the Highwavys Group of Estates. Ananda Plantations, Ponsiva Plantations, and Fieldmede Estate, are also some of the other small plantations in Meghamalai. An artificial lake makes plenty of scope for leisurely walks. Kardana Coffee Estate is situated in the High Wavy Mountains at . Six dams on the hill and originating place of Suruli Theertham (Suruli falls near Cumbum town) are popular attractions for tourists. From the Manalar dam, one can view the deep Cumbum Valley and the villages of Theni district. The Department of Tourism has planned to introduce a boat or ferry service to enable tourists to access the area.Highwavys to become a major tourism spot ===Vellimalai=== The Vellimalai (Silver Mountain, 1,650 m) area is the heart of Meghamalai. Silver-lined clouds seem to rest gently on green hilltops; nestled in this region is the place where the river Vaigai originates. This place offers an opportunity to see wild animals aesthetically and scientifically managed tea gardens. ==Falls== Meghamalai Falls (Suruli Falls) is on the Suruli River originating in the Meghamalai Hills. Water flows down 58 meters through the twin falls. There are frequent visits by elephants, spotted deer, gaur, and other wild animals at dawn and dusk. Forest Department officials have plans to assist tourists in viewing these wild animals. ==Encroachment threat== Massive encroachments in the reserved forests of almost all divisions in the district have been posing a threat to the eco- system of the Megamalai hills. Of the total 806.86 km2, about 400.77 km2 were degraded forest area. A total of 292.81 km2 falls under dense forest areas, of which only 22.43 km2 was tree bearing. About 220 out of 430 km2 of the Gandamanur forest range under the Madurai Forest Division had encroached in the past four decades. Large areas of Ulloothu Kavu, Anjaraipuli, Elamalaipoodu, Arasaradi, Bommarasapuram, and neighboring villages were also encroached. With an increase in population and their demands, vast stretches of land were either degraded or converted into uni-crop areas, causing damage to the environment. The people settled in the hill tracts were solely dependent on the forests for livelihood. Conservation of natural forest in any form will help preserve biodiversity.Encroachments a threat to Megamalai hills sanctuary plan == Access == The Meghamalai mountain range can be approached two ways‚Äîfrom Theni via Chinnamanur, or Andipatti via Kandamanayakkanur. Both can be accessed by road from Madurai and Dindigul. Theni is 76 km from Madurai. The road from the turnoff near Chinnamanur before Iravangalar was under the responsibility of the Woodbriar group; due to lack of maintenance, the government has started to maintain it. Only forest lodges and panchayath rest houses are available at the hilltop. Day-trippers may stay in hotels in Theni, Chinnamanur and Andipatti. The distance from Madurai is 130 km.

For example, in R2 register signalling, the transmission of each signal involves the following five events: *The outgoing trunk begins sending the tones that correspond to the signal it wishes to convey in the forward direction; *The incoming trunk, once it is sure to have correctly detected the above signal, begins sending a set of confirmation tones in the backward direction; *The outgoing trunk, once it is sure to have correctly detected the confirmation tones, stops sending the signal tones in the forward direction; *The incoming trunk, once it is sure to have detected the end of the signal tones (that is: that the forward channel is now silent) stops sending its confirmation tones in the backward direction; *Before being able to begin sending the next signal, if any, the outgoing trunk needs to ensure that it is receiving silence on the backward channel. The term is only relevant in the case of signalling systems that use discrete signals (e.g. a combination of tones to denote one digit), as opposed to signalling systems which are message- oriented, such as Signaling System 7 (SS7) and ISDN Q.931, where each message is able to convey multiple items of information (e.g. multiple digits of the called telephone number). The contrary of compelled signalling is referred to as non-compelled signalling. An example includes DTMF, where the originating side sends tones and silence in the forward direction, without being able to ascertain whether each tone has been correctly received by the terminating side. In order to minimise the risk of signalling errors, minimum durations are imposed, both on the tones and on the intervening periods of silence.

It is also known as Gold Town, Honest Plush Brannon and The Honest Thief.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Barbary Coast Gent ==Plot== Honest Plush Brannon (Wallace Beery) is a confidence man from the Barbary Coast in San Francisco. He is engaged to Li'l Damish (Binnie Barnes) who is a saloon owner. Plush is in need of money to prove he can stand on his own. His plan to come by some money is disturbed by his ex-companion, Duke Cleat (John Carradine), who accuses Plush of doing him wrong in the past. After a quick showdown, Plush manages to shoot and wound Duke badly. Because of this, Plush is forced to leave town, and decides to take the train to Denver to find his luck. Aboard the train he meets an industrial railroad Millionaire, Bradford Bellamy I (Donald Meek) and convinces him he is about to serve the man in a blackmailing process. Bellamy I wants to throw Plush off the train, but instead they make a deal, that Plush will hold a speech in Bellamy I's name in Gold Town. Plush pretends to be Bellamy I's financial voice and is greeted as such in Gold Town. Even his old partner with whom he used to rob stage coaches, Johnny Adair (Ray Collins), believes him. Johnny's daughter, Portia (Frances Rafferty) is engaged to Bellamy I's grandson, Bradford Bellamy III (Bruce Kellogg). When Plush is attending a ceremony and is about to dedicate a cornerstone in the city, he accidentally discovers that the stone has gold in it. Plush prevents an article declaring that Bellamy III is engaging another woman, an Eastern debutante, to reach the press, and since Bellamy III have no intentions of engaging anyone but Portia, he is grateful to Plush. When the gold finding in the cornerstone is confirmed, Plush clais the ground where the stone is, and everyone in Gold Town wants to invest in his newly founded gold- mining company. Back in San Francisco, Duke has recovered from his injuries and seeks revenge. He finds out about Plush's luck, and at gun-point he forces Plush to give all his earnings to him. Broke and homeless, Plush is forced to rob a Wells Fargo payroll stagecoach. He leaves a poem at the crime scene, and after a few more robberies, he is known as the outlaw \\"Jingle Bill\\". The only stage coach that never gets robbed is the one Johnny drives. Plush uses his booty to start up the mining for gold in his company, and soon enough he strikes gold. In an attempt to catch the robber, Plush is forced to stage a robbery against Johnny's coach, in which Plush participates. Plush is shot and wounded by Johnny. Meanwhile, Li'l has come to Gold Town to warn Plush that Duke has been at her place, stolen a bunch of Plush's poems, and is headed to Gold Town. After the fake robbery, suspicion falls on Plush to be the robber. When Duke confronts Plush in the street, the two men once again have a showdown, ultimately shooting each other. Duke dies from his wounds, and the stolen poems are found on his body. Duke is taken for Jingle Bill, but Plush steps up and confesses he is the robber. He waves goodbye to Li'l, Bellamy III and Portia, as he is off to serve a one-year sentence in prison.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1203/Barbary-Coast-Gent/ ==Cast== *Wallace Beery as Honest Plush Brannon *Binnie Barnes as Li'l Damish *John Carradine as Duke Cleat *Bruce Kellogg as Bradford Bellamy III *Frances Rafferty as Portia Adair *Chill Wills as Sheriff Hightower *Noah Beery, Sr. as Pete Hanibal *Henry O'Neill as Colonel Watrous *Ray Collins as Johnny Adair *Morris Ankrum as Alec Veeder *Donald Meek as Bradford Bellamy I ==See also== *List of American films of 1944 ==ReferencesCategory:1944 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Roy Del Ruth Category:American Western (genre) comedy films Category:1940s Western (genre) comedy films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films set in San Francisco Category:Barbary Coast, San Francisco Category:Films set in the 1880s Category:1940s historical comedy films Category:American historical comedy films ","title":"Barbary Coast Gent"},{"id":"9140914","text":"Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science is a book by Charles Wheelan that seeks to translate basic economic issues into a format that can be easily read by people with little or no previous knowledge of economics.

During this stage, the embryo is referred to as a blastula. The series of changes to the blastula that characterize the midblastula transition include activation of zygotic gene transcription, slowing of the cell cycle, increased asynchrony in cell division, and an increase in cell motility. == Blastula Before MBT == This is an embryo 4 hours after fertilization before it has undergone MBT. 3 layers are present: yolk syncytial layer (YSL), enveloping layer (EVL), and deep cells (DEL). Before the embryo undergoes the midblastula transition it is in a state of fast and constant replication of cells. The cell cycle is very short. The cells in the zygote are also replicating synchronously, always undergoing cell division at the same time. The zygote is not producing its own mRNA but rather it is using mRNAs that were produced in the mother and loaded into the oocyte in order to produce proteins necessary for zygotic growth. The zygotic DNA (genetic material) is not being used because it is repressed through a variety of mechanisms such as methylation. This repressed DNA is sometimes referred to as heterochromatin and is tightly packed together inside the cell because it is not being used for transcription. == Characteristics of the MBT == Maternal-zygotic-transition. Changes in RNA over time as the embryo goes through changes in structure from the 1 cell stage to the gastrula stage. The drop in maternal RNA concentration shows the midblastula transition. Blue line represents maternal mRNA and red line represents zygotic mRNA. Before the zygote undergoes the midblastula transition it is in a state of fast and constant replication of cells. Cell Cycle with G1 and G2 phases. Orange circle shows what the cell cycle looks like before the MBT. The multi-colored inside circle shows what the cell cycle looks like after MBT and the addition of G1 and G2 phases. === Activation of Zygotic Gene Transcription === At this stage, the zygote starts producing its own mRNAs that are made from its own DNA, and no longer uses the maternal mRNA. This can also be called the maternal to zygotic transition. The maternal mRNAs are then degraded. Since the cells are now transcribing their own DNA, this stage is where expression of paternal genes is first observed. === Cell Cycle Changes === When the zygote begins to produce its own mRNA, the cell cycle begins to slow down and the G1 and G2 phases are added to the cell cycle. The addition of these phases allows the cell to have more time to proofread the new genetic material it is making to ensure there are no mutations. The asynchronous nature of the cell divisions is an important change that occurs during/after the MBT. === Cell Motility === ==Timing of MBT== The timing of MBT varies between different organisms. Zebrafish MBT occurs at cycle 10, but it occurs at cycle 13 in both Xenopus and Drosophila. Cells are thought to time the MBT by measuring the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, which is the ratio between the volume of the nucleus, which contains DNA, to the volume of cytosol. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from experiments showing that the timing of MBT can be sped up by adding extra DNA to make the nucleus larger, or by halving the amount of cytoplasm. The exact methods by which the cell achieves this control is unknown, but it is thought to involve proteins in the cytosol. In Drosophila, the zinc-finger transcription factor Zelda is bound to regulatory regions of genes expressed by the zygote, and in zebrafish, the homeodomain protein Pou5f3 (a paralog of mammalian POU5F1 (OCT4) has an analogous role. Without the function of these proteins MBT gene expression synchrony is disrupted, but particular mechanisms of coordinating the timing of gene expression are still unknown but being studied. ==References== Category:Animal developmental biology ","title":"Midblastula"},{"id":"9140941","text":"is a railway station on the Hokuriku Main Line in the city of Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, Japan, operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). ==Lines== Morita Station is served by the Hokuriku Main Line, and is located 105.8 kilometers from the terminus of the line at . ==Station layout== The station consists of two unnumbered opposed side platforms connected by a footbridge.

As she bathes in a pond along the trail, Sierra Nevada encounters a stranger, Farrell, a hired gunman who warns her about dangerous Indians nearby. Farrell is on his way to work for Tom McCord, a rich rancher. Quite a bit of rustling has been going on in the territory of late. McCord is in cahoots with Indians, in particular Natchakoa of the Blackfoot tribe, whose braves stampede the Jones family's cattle, knock Sierra cold, wound her cowhand Nat and kill Pop, after which McCord steals a document from Pop's dead body that grants rights to the land. Sierra is nursed back to health by Colorados, a young Blackfoot who attends school among the whites, to the displeasure of the tribal chief, his father. McCord offers a $2,000 bounty to Farrell if he kills Sierra, but instead Farrell comes to her rescue. Farrell reveals that he is actually an agent for the U.S. Cavalry, investigating the rustling and killing.

There is a small railway station named Borhat (BFD) which is in the central place of the region. During Ahom rule, Borhat was known as a place for finding mineral salt. The name Borhat is originated from Bor '‡¶¨‡ß∞' (meaning big '‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶ô‡ß∞' ) and hat '‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶ü' (market '‡¶¨‡¶ú‡¶æ‡ß∞'). There was a market place where salt was available. Salt was considered to be very precious during Ahom rule as Assam is far from the seas and people had to use only mineral salts. Modern day Borhat has a number of tea gardens, some of them founded by the British and many families have small tea plantations in their orchard.

In 2001, Republic Act No. 9054 was passed for the expansion of the ARMM to include the areas which initially rejected inclusion and the provinces which were carved from them. However, only Marawi City and Basilan, with the exception of Isabela City, opted to be integrated in the region. A special plebiscite was set on August 14, 2001. ==ResultsRules=== Each province, and their component cities, has their own separate plebiscite. In order for the plebiscite to be approved, a majority of the people who voted is needed, if it fails to surpass the majority of valid votes, the plebiscite is defeated in that province or city. *For provinces voted for expansion and amendments to the original organic act: **If a majority did not vote in favor, all amendments to the organic act, save for provinces and cities that voted for inclusion, are rejected. *For provinces and cities voting for inclusion: **If a majority in each city or province votes in favor, it becomes a part of the autonomous region; in case of component cities, they do not cease to be a part of their province but regional services will be under the ARMM. **If a majority in a municipality does not vote in favor of inclusion but the totals for the rest of the province are in favor it will be a part of the ARMM nevertheless.

The son of Jo√£o Pires Cubas and Isabel Nunes, he was twice governor of the Captaincy of S√£o Vicente (1545-1549 and 1555-1556). He arrived in the Portuguese colony of Brazil in the year of 1531 with Martim Afonso de Sousa, the founder of the Captaincy of S√£o Vicente. The region of Santos was already populated, but it was Br√°s Cubas who officially founded the village because in 1543, he founded the first Holy House of Mercy, which he called All Saints, a name that would pass to the village, the port of which was better located than the one in S√£o Vicente. He was responsible for the transference of the harbor from Ponta da Praia to the city center, in the environs of Outeiro de Santa Catarina. Besides being the founder of Santos, he organized expeditions for the Crown and, afterwards, was also the governor of the Captaincy of S√£o Vicente. He was once the biggest land owner of the coastal region. In 1551, was named by John III of Portugal, the Provider and Accountant of the Incomes and Rights of the Captaincy; in the following year, he built the fort of S√£o Filipe in the island of Santo Amaro. He had a memorable participation in the defense of the captaincy against the attacks of the native Tamoios, then allied to the French. Later, on the orders of the third general-governor Mem de S√°, he carried out expeditions through the interior in search of gold and silver. The accounts say he arrived as far as Chapada Diamantina in the outback of Bahia. His attempts to enslave the natives resulted in a revolt that ended up by determining the appearance of the Tamoio Confederation, that could only be partially contained by the action of the jesuits Manuel da N√≥brega and Jos√© de Anchieta. When he died, he was a nobleman of the Royal House and one of the most respected men in the captaincy. The title of alcaide-mor (mayor) of the village of Santos passed down to his son, P√™ro Cubas. In his epitaph, one can read that he discovered ¬´gold and metals in 1560¬ª. In 1578, by the way, the news of the existence of gold and silver mines in S√£o Paulo was current, according to an English subject who lived in Santos.

Administratively, it is a county-level city of Suihua City. ==HistoryBefore Qing Dynasty=== Hailun is one of the counties with early governance in Heilongjiang Province. Since ancient times, the ancestors of the Chinese nation have worked and lived on this land. During the Qin, Han, Tang, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, ethnic minorities lived, reproduced, and worked. The city of Hailun is named after the Hailun River. The name Hailun is a variation of the manchu language word that sounds like \\"kailing\\", which means \\"otter\\" . It is named because the otter is abundant in the Hailun River. It was named hailun after the establishment of the city. The area around Hailun was the Qing court. Hai lun was successively ruled in Hulan City Shouwei, by the Hulan Deputy Capital. ===Qing Dynasty=== In 1885 (the eleventh year of Guangxu in Qing Dynasty), after the Suihua Office was established, it was under the jurisdiction of the Suihua Office. In the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu (1898), Tongkun Deputy Metropolitan Government was established, and the territory of Hailun County was under its jurisdiction; in the thirty-two years of Guangxu (1906), Tongken Deputy Metropolitan Government was cut and Tongken Association was appointed; In the first year of Xuantong (1909), Helen Zhili Office was changed to Hailun Mansion; ===Republic of China=== In 1912 (the first year of the Republic of China), Hailun Prefecture was changed to Hailun County; in the 6th year of the Republic of China (1917), Wangkui was established in January. Since then, Hailun and Wangkui divided and restored Hailun County; in 1932, after the Japanese invasion, Hailun County belongs to the pseudo-binjiang province. On August 15, 1945, manchukuo was destroyed and the people of the county were liberated.

On January 11, 1990, the county was officially withdrawn from the city. In August 2016, Changfa Township, Yongfu Township, and Xiangrong Township of Hailun City withdrew their towns and established towns.

Anybody who drives in Mumbai has experienced the 2-odd minute wait at a traffic signal. The traffic signal includes a microcosm of people who derive their daily livelihoods from it. There are beggars (kids and adults), prostitutes, tricksters, eunuchs and others who sell clothes, flowers and trinkets. They speak quickly, act fast and operate somewhat honourably (with each other) to eke a meager living out of the harsh Mumbai street life. They owe allegiance and hafta (weekly \\"protection\\" fee) to the signal manager, Silsila (Kunal Khemu). Silsila grew up at the signal. He ran various trades there before he became the manager. He is an ideal manager: sensitive and caring of his workers yet ruthless when it comes to delivery. Silsila reports into a mid-level don, Jaffar, who in turn reports to the big boss Haji bhaijaan. Life is well at the signal. A gentle girl, Rani (Neetu Chandra), arrives at the signal to sell ethnic clothes. The initial fireworks blossom into deeper companionship with Silsila. Everything proceeds normally. Unbeknownst to Silsila, Haji bhaijaan is part of a larger nexus of evil that comprises politicians and the larger Mafia. Haji must play a dangerous game where he is forced to invoke the unwitting pawn, Silsila, to start a series of events that could ultimately destroy the traffic signal. Silsila is unaware of the larger consequences as he carries out his orders without question. But reality dawns on him when he is apprehended in a case of murder, extortion and bribery where he was hardly aware of things. The signal faces destruction. Silsila's world, and all the people who grew up with it, face extinction. Silsila is forced to make a choice between his life and his world. As his life moves from Green to Red, he may only hope that the signal moves from Red to Green. == Cast == * Kunal Khemu as Silsila * Neetu Chandra as Rani * Ranvir Shorey as Dominic * Kapil Rajput as Vishal * Konkona Sen Sharma as Noorie * Upendra Limaye as Mangaya * Sudhir Mishra as Haji Bhaijaan * Gopal K Singh as Samari * Madhu Sharma as Businessman's Wife * D.

Perry. USS PC-565 was commissioned on 25 May 1942 with Lt. Walter T. Flynn in command. After shakedown off Florida, PC-565 engaged in anti-submarine warfare training, then performed convoy escort and patrol duty in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. On 2 June, while escorting a southbound convoy from New York to Cuba, soundman Cisco Reeh made underwater sound contact and PC-565 immediately attacked. After PC-565 dropped a depth charge barrage the surfaced to be met with 20 mm gunfire. Several hits were scored, and the enemy U-boat went under only to be met with another depth charge barrage. Large oil slicks and debris resulted, proving the destruction of the German U-boat. The only survivor of the 52 men aboard, Captain Klaus Bargsten, was rescued by PC-565 and his testimony substantiated PC-565's victory. Departing New York on 25 March 1944, PC-565 sailed to England where she joined the amphibious forces in preparation for the D-Day landings. On 4 June she sailed from England arriving off the Normandy beaches 2 days later. There she performed ASW patrols, antiaircraft defense, and shuttle control duties. Throughout the rest of the war, PC-565 remained in Europe on escort and patrol missions in the North Sea-English Channel area.

Made in America. September 2012. Philadelphia. Arson and his brother Per (Howlin' Pelle, lead singer) formed the band in 1993, and, according to a biography about the band, attracted the attention of promoter/manager/songwriter Randy Fitzsimmons (possibly a fictional character), who propelled the band to fame. It was revealed in NME that Randy Fitzsimmons is a registered pseudonym belonging to Arson. This has led many to believe that Randy Fitzsimmons is in fact a myth, and that it is Arson who writes the songs. Arson and the rest of the band deny this and insist on the existence of Randy Fitzsimmons as the band's songwriter. Arson, as with the rest of The Hives, is known for his onstage antics. In particular, his beady eye stares, spitting, blowing on his finger tips, flicking his guitar picks into the crowd and wild animation in playing the guitar. == Musical equipment == Nicholaus uses almost exclusively Fender Telecaster, Esquire or Telecaster Deluxe style guitars (though he is seen playing a Danelectro in the Hate to Say I Told You So video).

It is an avatar of Lord Vishnu to fight Lord Sharabha, who in-turn was an avatar of Lord Shiva and had the mission of stopping Narasimha, Vishnu's lion avatar. Berunda, the two headed bird, was unable to overcome Sharabha and eventually Lord Shiva controlled Berunda (Lord Vishnu) and protected the Universe. lord shiva called to be protector of Univese along with Distruction, It was the emblem of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore under the Wodeyar kings, and after India attained independence, it was retained by Mysore state as its emblem. That state was enlarged in 1956 and renamed Karnataka in 1973, and the Gandabherunda continues to be the official state emblem of Karnataka. It is used as the official emblem of the Karnataka state government because it is a symbol of strength. It is believed to be capable of fighting the forces of destruction. It appears as an intricately carved sculpture motif in Hindu temples. ==Depiction== The bird is generally depicted as clutching elephants in its talons and beaks, demonstrating its immense strength. In a coin [Kasu] found in Madurai, it is shown holding a snake in its beak.Ganesh Coins of Tamilnadu, 13.48 All 2-dimensional depictions show a symmetrical image similar to the Double-headed eagle while other images show the long tail feathers resembling a peacock, which is the national bird of India. In the Chennakeshava temple of Belur, Karnataka, Gandaberunda, the two faced bird is carved as a scene of \\"chain of destruction\\" result in distruction of Universe. The Gandaberunda was later identified as a physical form displayed by Narasimha, Man-Lion incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It's mentioned by several Hindu scriptures. After Lord Narasimha had slain the demon Hiranyakashipu, he clung on to his dreadful form. The Devas were even more afraid of Lord Vishnu than they were of the demon. In order to protect the entire creation, lord Shiva incarnated as Sharabha or Sharabhesvara, a part-lion and part-bird beast. This further angered Lord Narasimha who took the form of Lord Gandaberunda, who fought Sharabha for 18 days.Finaly Gandaberunda stopped by sharaba with the Help of goddess Pratyngira Finaly Universe is protected. http://thepatriot.in/2018/11/29/one- bird-two-heads/ ==Usage== A sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda is found on the roof of the Rameshwara temple in the temple town of Keladi in Shimoga District, the capital of the Keladi Nayakas. The Gandaberunda was also used by the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysore as the Royal emblem. The Karnataka Government adopted this symbol as the state symbol and can be found on bus terminals and tickets issued by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation. Coins(Gold pagoda or gadyana) from the rule of Achyuta Deva Raya are thought to be the first to use the Gandaberunda on currency. The crest of the Indian navy ship INS Mysore (D60) features a Gandaberunda. === Emblem === Gandaberunda is the official emblem of Karnataka state government. It was the royal insignia of the erstwhile Mysore kingdom. The Deccan Herald wrote, \\"When Dasara completed four hundred years this year, another major feature associated with Mysore kingdom, the royal insignia Gandaberunda quietly celebrated 500th year. The City Herald tried to dig into the roots of the Gandaberunda and stumbled upon some exciting stories associated with it. The Gandaberunda is an imaginary two headed bird. Even five centuries after its first usage in the mints for making coins during the period of Vijayanagar empire around 1510, the Gandaberunda is still flying high as the symbol of seat of power of Karnataka - the official insignia of State. Though the 400th year of Dasara (which was tipped for the most grand celebrations), did not live up to its expectations, the 500th year of adoption of Gandaberunda received a floral celebration, with a 10 foot flower model of the imaginary bird put on display at the Dasara flower show. Historian Professor P V Nanjaraje Urs -- who has widely researched Mysore State -- tells that the Gandaberunda was first used as a sign on coins in Vijayanagar mints, many of which still exist. Since then, the tradition passed on to generations. In mid-16th century, legend says that Yaduraya embarked on a Vijaya Yathra across the Mysore State to consolidate their rank. During the Yathra, an ascetic encountered and gave him a red cloth. The King offered pooja to it and accepted it as a blessing. He won all acclaim thereafter.\\" Following his stature raising to new heights, he announced red cloth as Rajdhwaja or State flag. To add the principles of dharma and satya, the flag got a slogan as \\"Sathymevodhbhavaramyaham\\" with imaginary bird Gandaberunda. The bird was surrounded by elephant headed lion on two sides and a lion carrying Mahishasura‚Äôs head on the top.

Budameru is also known as The Sorrow of Vijayawada. In order to control the floods, the river was dammed at Velagaleru village and a diversion channel named, Budameru Diversion Channel (BDC) was constructed from Velagaleru to join Krishna River upstream of Prakasam Barrage. This is the first water diversion to the main Krishna river from another river basin. The diversion channel has 10,500 cusecs flow capacity. This diversion channel is made part of Polavaram right bank canal at its tail end. However its flow capacity is to be enhanced to 17,500 cusecs to match with the design capacity of Polavaram right bank canal. Some water from Polavaram right bank canal can be fed to Eluru canal of Krishna delta by allowing the water to flow in the Budemeru river and connecting the river by gravity to the canal as river is passing by the side of this canal in Vijayawada city (refer 'Google Earth' geographic maps). Thus water can be transferred directly to Prakasam barrage pond via Eluru canal. ==Hydro power station feasibility== A hydro power plant of 25 MW capacity can be installed by routing Polavaram Right bank canal water to Prakasam barrage via existing Eluru canal. Polavaram Right bank canal is approaching the outskirts of Vijayawada city at 33 m MSL along the hill slopes located north of Ambapuram village. This point is only 7 km north of Prakasam Barrage but the canal takes another 30 km detour to get connected to the Prakasam barrage pond near Ibrahimpatnam town. The existing Eluru canal from Prakasam barrage was dug across the elevated ridge/doab (where Vijayawada city is located) to cross the Krishna river basin and supply water in to lower Budameru river basin. This canal while crossing the city is a deep cut canal (maximum water level below local ground level). Eluru deep cut canal portion (first 3 km length) can be safely used to feed water (reversing water flow direction) in to Prakasam barrage pond (full pond level at 17.35 m MSL) by connecting Polavaram Right bank canal with the canal after Ayodhya Nagar. A hydraulic drop of nearly 11 meters is available when the Polavaram right bank canal is connected to the canal which would generate 25 MW Hydro power at 10,000 cusecs flow. No land acquisition in Vijawawada city is required as the tail race canal is routed along the Budameru stream to connect to the existing canal. ==Interstate water sharing== As per the inter state agreements dated 4 August 1978 (page 89) and 29 January 1979 (page 101) with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are entitled to use 21 tmcft and 14 tmcft respectively out of the 80 tmcft water transferred by Polavaram right bank canal from Polavaram reservoir to Prakasam barrage pond across Krishna river. If the Prakasam barrage east delta water requirements (Water supplied by Eluru, Pamarru and Bander canals) are met directly from the Polavaram right bank canal bypassing Prakasam barrage pond/Krishna main river, this water would not be accounted under the 80 tmc which is to be shared with Karnataka and Maharashtra. Thus more Godavari water could be made available for use from the Prakasam barrage by connecting Polavaram right bank canal with Eluru canal via Budameru river. == References == Category:Water bodies of Andhra Pradesh Category:Geography of Vijayawada ","title":"Budameru Rivulet"},{"id":"9141411","text":"Bridalveil Fall.

It should not be confused with the Diocese of Osnabr√ºck (), which was larger and over which the prince-bishop exercised only the spiritual authority of an ordinary bishop. It was named after its capital, Osnabr√ºck. The still-extant Diocese of Osnabr√ºck, erected in 772, is the oldest see founded by Charlemagne, in order to Christianize the conquered stem-duchy of Saxony. The episcopal and capitular temporal possessions of the see, originally quite limited, grew in time, and its prince-bishops exercised an extensive civil jurisdiction within the territory covered by their rights of Imperial immunity. The Prince-Bishopric continued to grow in size, making its status during the Reformation a highly contentious issue. The Peace of Westphalia left the city bi-confessional and had the Prince-Bishops alternate between Catholic and Protestant. The bishopric was dissolved in the German Mediatisation of 1803, when it was incorporated into the neighboring Electorate of Hanover. The see, the chapter, the convents and the Catholic charitable institutions were secularized. The territory of the see passed to Prussia in 1806, to the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, to Napoleonic France in 1810, and back to Hanover in 1814. With the end of the prince-bishopric, the future of the diocese became unclear. Klemens von Gruben, titular Bishop of Paros in Greece, was made vicar apostolic of Osnabr√ºck, and as such cared for the spiritual interests of the Catholic population. The ordinary Latin (Roman) Catholic episcopacy was restored in 1824, but henceforth the bishops would no longer wield any temporal power. ==History== The temporal protectorate (; ) exercised over so many mediaeval dioceses by laymen became, after the 12th century, hereditary in the Amelung family, from whom it passed to Henry the Lion. After Henry's overthrow, it came into the possession of Count Simon of Tecklenburg and his descendants, though it was the source of many conflicts with the bishops. In 1236 the Count of Tecklenburg was forced to renounce all jurisdiction over the town of Osnabr√ºck, as well as the lands of the see, the chapter and the parish churches. On the other hand, the bishop and chapter, from the 13th century on, expanded their jurisdiction over many convents, churches and hamlets. Scarcely any other German see freed itself so thoroughly from civil jurisdiction within its territory. The royal prerogatives were transferred little by little to the bishop, e.g. the holding of fairs and markets, rights of toll and coinage, forest and hunting rights, mining royalties and fortresses so that, by the early part of the 13th century, the bishop was the real governor of the civil territory of Osnabr√ºck. St. Peter's Cathedral (Osnabr√ºck) Among the prominent mediaeval bishops were: Drogo (952‚Äì68); Conrad of Veltberg (1002); the learned Thietmar or Detmar (1003‚Äì22); Benno II (1067‚Äì88); Johann I (1001‚Äì10), who built the actual cathedral in place of the wooden one destroyed by fire in the time of his predecessor; Diethard I (1119‚Äì37) who was the first bishop elected by the free choice of the cathedral clergy; Philip II (1141‚Äì73) who ended the conflicts between his see and the Imperial Abbeys of Corvey and Hersfeld; and Arnold of Berg (1137‚Äì91), who died a crusader at Akkon. In the time of Engelbert of Altena- Isenberg (1224‚Äì26, deposed following his implication in Archbishop Engelbert II of Berg's assassination, rehabilitated 1238‚Äì50), Bruno of Altena-Isenberg (1250‚Äì59), and under Conrad II of Rietberg (1269‚Äì97), the new orders of Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustinians were received with favour. ===14th to 16th centuries=== In the 14th and 15th centuries, the power of the bishops waned before the increasing influence of the cathedral chapter, of the military servants (or knights) of the diocese, and of the town of Osnabr√ºck. The last sought to free itself from the bishop's sovereignty, but never became a Free City of the Empire. The see was almost continually engaged in warlike troubles and difficulties and had even to defend itself against the Bishops of Minden and M√ºnster. From the 14th century auxiliary bishops became necessary due to the civil duties that absorbed the attention of the bishop himself. The successor of Bishop Conrad IV of Rietberg (1488‚Äì1508) was Eric of Brunswick (1508‚Äì32), simultaneously Bishop of M√ºnster and Paderborn. He opposed the Reformers strongly and successfully. Franz of Waldeck (1533‚Äì53), also Bishop of Minden, acted, on the contrary, a very doubtful part. He offered little resistance to Lutheranism in M√ºnster, though he vigorously opposed the Anabaptists; after 1543 he allowed in Osnabr√ºck an evangelical service. However, the chapter and the Dominicans opposed a German service that dispensed with all the characteristics of the Roman Catholic Mass. In 1548, Bishop Franz promised to suppress the Reformation in Osnabr√ºck and to execute the Augsburg Interim, but fulfilled his promise very indifferently; on his deathbed he received Lutheran communions. His successor, John IV of Hoya (1553‚Äì74), was more Catholic, but was succeeded by three bishops of a Protestant mind: Henry II of Saxe-Lauenburg (1574‚Äì85), Bernhard of Waldeck (1585‚Äì91), and Philip Sigismund (1591‚Äì1623). Under them the Reformation swept over most of the diocese. ===17th and 18th centuries=== Map of the Prince- Bishopric in 1642 The Bishop's Palace at Osnabr√ºck (after 1777) In 1624, Cardinal Eitel Frederick of Hohenzollern became Bishop of Osnabr√ºck and called in the Jesuits. However, he died soon afterwards. His successor, Francis of Wartenberg (1625‚Äì61), fulfilled the task of imposing the Counter-Reformation decrees. The city-council was purged of anti-Catholic elements and the former Augustinian convent was turned over to the Jesuits. The Edict of Restitution was executed successfully by him and in 1631 he founded a university at Osnabr√ºck. But in 1633, Osnabr√ºck was captured by the Swedes: the university was discontinued, Catholic religious exercises suppressed, and the see (1633‚Äì51) administered by the conquerors. In 1648, the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated in Osnabr√ºck and the nearby city of Munster. The Treaty of Osnabr√ºck stipulated that the bishopric would return to the religious status it had in 1624. Henceforth, the Prince-Bishops would alternate between Catholic and Protestant officeholders, with the Protestant bishops to be selected from the cadets of the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. During periods of Protestant rule, the spiritual care of the Catholics was committed to the Archbishop of Cologne. Wartenberg was made cardinal in 1660 and was succeeded by the married Protestant bishop, Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover (1661‚Äì98), who largely resided in Hanover. He built the new palace in Osnabr√ºck from 1667 and was succeeded by the Catholic bishop, Prince Charles Joseph of Lorraine. The Protestant bishop Ernest Augustus (1715‚Äì28), second son of the previous Ernest Augustus, was succeeded by Clemens August of Bavaria, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne (1728‚Äì61). The last bishop was Prince Frederick of Great Britain (1764‚Äì1803), the second son of George III, King of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover. Prince Frederick was only six months old when he was elected bishop. ===Residence=== From about 1100, after a fire destroyed Osnabr√ºck cathedral and its adjacent bishop's house, bishops had their residence at Iburg Castle. They moved back into town after Ernest Augustus built a baroque palace in Osnabr√ºck, completed in 1673. Today Iburg Castle is a museum and seat of a local court while the Bishop's Palace houses the University of Osnabruck. King George I of Great Britain died in the palace while visiting his brother, prince-bishop Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany, in 1727.

A number of variants of the mine were produced and although the mine is no longer in US service, it can be found in Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Korea, Laos, Oman, Rwanda, Tunisia and the Western Sahara. Copies of the mine were produced by Belgium (as the PRB M966), Pakistan (P7), Portugal (M/966) and Taiwan. The mine consists of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand. The fuze stand held either a pin based tripwire fuze or a combination pressure tripwire fuze with a pronged pressure cap. Later fuzes were sensitive to pressure or pull and could be used with a tripwire. When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of the main body of the mine and into the air. A pyrotechnic delay fuse triggers the mine when it has risen to between two and three meters in height. The lethal radius of the mine is reported to be approximately ten meters. ==Development== The US began development of the anti-personnel mines in the summer of 1940 spurred on by events in the Second World War. A French officer, Major Pierre Delalande (sometimes Paul Delalande) who had escaped the fall of France came to the US with the plans of the Modele 1939 bounding mine.The mine was patented in the United States under the name \\"Paul Delalande\\" US Patent 2,374,179 at GooglePatents The M2 series of mines were based on this design, and were first fielded in mid-1943. ==Status== The mine has not been in US service for some time, having been replaced by the M16 mine soon after the Second World War. The M2 was not considered a successful design, and was replaced with more successful German-based designs.Lieutenant-Colonel John Ingraham & Col. Dalton Jones.

I got a studio out here [in Los Angeles] and I'm able to meet a lot of new artists.\\" When asked the meaning of M.W.A, Dean answered: \\"That's just what I call myself when I DJ. Mexican Wrestling Association.

(Ray Stevenson) to assemble a crack team of ex-soldiers ‚Äì Prior (Richard Brake), Jordan (Paul Blair), Cotter (Enoch Frost), Voyteche (Julian Rivett), McKay (Michael Smiley) and Taktarov (Brett Fancy) ‚Äì to protect him on a dangerous journey into no-man's land. Their mission is to scope out an old military bunker in Eastern Europe, likely in Bosnia. Voyteche, one of the mercenaries, claims that there is nothing important located in the area they are heading to. As the mercenaries approach their destination, they hear sounds of fighting off the instance; fighter jets pass overhead, and artillery can be heard as well. As they make their way through the woods an intense burst of static knocks out their radio communications. The mercenaries speculate as to what their job is and why they have been hired. Reaching their destination, the team discoveries that the location is a seemingly abandoned bunker complex. Leaving two of the mercenaries, Jordan and Taktarov, aboveground to watch their backs, the rest of the team fans out and begins to explore the outpost. Above ground, Jordan notices a flash of light coming from the tree line. The two mercenaries assume that it is sunlight flashing off a scope and open fire, causing the rest of the team to come racing back up the top. Another burst of static is heard over the team‚Äôs radio, and suddenly radio operator McKay is wounded. D.C. soon realizes that it doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone is actually out there, as the only shot fired in return was the one which wounded McKay. Taktarov, who had continued to fire after D.C. ordered a halt, is sent out into the tree line in order to check for a body or blood. He returns a minute later to report that there was no sign of a shooter‚Äî no bodies, no blood, not even shell casings to indicate anyone had been there. The mercenaries get back to work exploring the bunker; despite it seemingly having been abandoned for decades they discover a small modern metal crucifix necklace dangling in a forgotten corner of the bunker. Locating the bunker‚Äôs generator, D.C. and Hunt get to work restoring the power. Meanwhile, Cotter and McKay discover a room filled with corpses and are horrified when an arm sudden shoots up from the pile of corpses. They frantically call for Jordan, the team‚Äôs medic. D.C. leaves Prior to protect Hunt while he and Jordan race to the scene, and begin tending to the survivor, G√∂tz (Johnny Meres). As the lights come on, Prior discovers a room with a projector screen. Lifting it up, a flag can be seen on the wall behind it. Prior then slowly steps back, revealing the swastika on the flag‚Äî the symbol of the Nazi Party. The mercenaries begin interrogating G√∂tz, who is catatonic, with McKay being particularly demanding. The mercenaries assume that local paramilitaries had used the bunker to hide the evidence of ethnic cleansing. Prior shows them the Nazi flag he found, and Jordan suggests that there might be a stockpile of Nazi gold, looted from the nations they conquered, hidden in the bunker. D.C. orders the rest of the team to prepare defenses for a prolonged stay, as they assume whoever shot at them earlier was likewise looking for gold. McKay sets up a command outpost in a central room, propping G√∂tz up in a nearby chair, while Hunt begins to go through a set of documents. He then heads into a back room where he discovers an odd spherical machine known as Die Glocke‚Äî an example of occultistic Nazi experiments. He reports his discovery to his employers. Out of boredom, McKay sets up a chessboard on the table between himself and G√∂tz. Going through a box full of personal effects, he discovers an old German coin. Dropping it, McKay reaches down to pick it back up....only to see the jackbooted legs of a pair of men standing next to G√∂tz. Hurriedly throwing himself to the side, McKay draws his pistol, only for there to be no sign of the two men. D.C. wanders into the room to see McKay lying on the floor, and is less than impressed. He sends McKay to try and get the radio working again. Hunt, meanwhile, is working in the room with Die Glocke; over his shoulder the form of a SS trooper can be seen stepping out of the shadows. A noise is heard in the background, and Hunt heads to the door, but can‚Äôt get it open. As he fiddles with it, the SS trooper suddenly looms up behind him, and heavy breathing can be heard; Hunt spins around quickly, only for there to be nothing there again. He is angry, assuming that one of the mercenaries was playing a prank on him. He then fills D.C. in on the premise behind Die Glocke‚Äî that it was a project carried out by the SS during World War II, using reality shifting and reanimation to create invincible soldiers. Additional paranormal events continue to happen to the men in the outpost. McKay manages to get the original bunker radio equipment working, initially producing eerily scream-like static before suddenly switching to classical music. Despite unplugging the radio, McKay is unable to get it to stop functioning before it suddenly shuts itself off in a small explosion. That night, the clearing around the bunker is suddenly shrouded by an eerie mist, and silhouettes of SS troopers are seen up on the ridgeline, causing the mercenaries to open fire. Despite all their shooting, the figures on the ridgeline don‚Äôt seem to be affected, and an intense windstorm forces the mercenaries to take cover. When they emerge from cover, Taktarov is missing. The mercenaries discover that their claymore land mines are intact, meaning that there wasn‚Äôt a way for their enemies to get in close. D.C. discovers an Iron Cross badge and blood on the ground near Taktarov‚Äôs position. Back in the bunker, Jordan shows D.C. the round he removed while treating McKay‚Äôs wound‚Äî a German rifle round not in use since the Second World War. The bullet is warped and deformed; the odds that it could have been fired from a rifle are slim. D.C. drags G√∂tz into an interrogation room and threatens him with a pistol; he still doesn‚Äôt speak, but he clearly snaps out of his catatonia, indicating it may have been act all along. D.C. demands answers regarding the assignment from Hunt: an unnamed corporation wanted Hunt to find and recover a large generator-like device responsible for the SS reality-shifting experiments. Hunt theorizes that the Germans‚Äô experiments with the nature of reality trapped them within the area around the bunker. He reveals that his backers have contacts in Interpol, and if the team tries to leave early hitmen will be dispatched to go after the mercenaries‚Äô families, as well as his own. Aboveground, Taktarov is brutally tortured and killed by the undead SS; a short time later, as the other mercenaries discuss their pasts and keep watch, Voyteche, who is off on his own on the other side of the perimeter, is silently stabbed to death by a pair of undead SS troopers. The next morning, Voytech and Taktarov's dead bodies are found joined at the head, with Taktarov's skull containing a spent round. The second killing is the final straw for D.C. Despite the threat of Hunt‚Äôs backers, he decides to leave the bunker. Hunt protests vehemently, and returns to the generator room, with D.C. sending Cotter to retrieve him. Cotter reaches the generator room, and ignores Hunt‚Äôs dire warnings in order to try and get him ready to leave. Suddenly, Hunt freezes and stares, as the form of another SS trooper emerges behind Cotter. Hearing the heavy breathing and noticing Hunt‚Äôs reaction, Cotter orders Hunt to run as he draws his knife and swings at the SS trooper, who ducks and buries a pickaxe in Cotter‚Äôs chest. The undead SS soldier then crushes Cotter‚Äôs skull, killing him. Hunt snatches up Cotter‚Äôs AKM assault rifle and fires several bursts into the SS soldier‚Äôs back, which only seems to irritate it. The remaining mercenaries come running, only for the figure to vanish as they fire at it. D.C. and Hunt show the surviving mercenaries the tape of the SS‚Äô experiments. It is revealed on the tape that G√∂tz is actually a surviving SS Brigadef√ºhrer (brigadier general) and the man responsible for running the experiments at the outpost. An enraged Prior promptly shoots him in the head. However, after Prior kills G√∂tz, the \\"breather\\" comes back to life almost immediately. The lights go out, and MacKay is killed, with the team discovering his corpse at the bunker‚Äôs entrance. The mercenaries and Hunt attempt to restart Die Glocke to neutralize the powers of the undead SS and trap them in order to evacuate the outpost. The surviving mercenaries engage in a battle with the undead SS garrison, now led by G√∂tz. The mercenaries slowly retreat as the undead SS advance into the bunker, using the narrow confines to buy themselves time. Prior delays too long in retreating down one of the corridors and is overrun, but manages to finish off a few of the undead SS before being killed himself. Hunt manages to get Die Glocke working, setting off a shockwave which seemingly disables the attacking undead SS. However, the unstable machine promptly shuts down again, and the SS get back to their feet. Jordan is pulled down a side corridor and killed. D.C. tries to buy time for Hunt to escape through the bunker‚Äôs ventilation system, only to be overrun and killed after a heroic last stand. Hunt makes it to a set of doors to an upper level of the outpost, only to be confronted by G√∂tz and his men blocking his way. Hunt is pulled down from behind and killed. A second corporate team arrives 72 hours later to carry out the same assignment, only to find a \\"breather\\" among the piles of naked corpses. The clearing is lit again, revealing the illuminated soldiers surrounding the bunker. In the distance stands the Brigadef√ºhrer, who gives the SS soldiers a nod and they begin their assault on the team. ==Cast== *Julian Wadham as Hunt, \\"Company\\" agent *Ray Stevenson as DC, British Royal Marine Warrant Officer *Richard Brake as Prior, United States Marine Corps *Paul Blair as Jordan, French Foreign Legionnaire *Brett Fancy as Taktarov (\\"Tak\\"), Russian Alpha Group *Enoch Frost as Cotter, Belgian Peacekeeper *Julian Rivett as Voyteche, Yugoslav military *Michael Smiley as McKay (\\"Mac\\"), British Army Parachute Regiment *Johnny Meres as Brigadef√ºhrer G√∂tz, German SS (Schutzstaffel) Officer (\\"The Breather\\") == Production == The film was produced by Scottish couple Arabella Croft and Kieran Parker and their production company Black Camel Pictures.

The sinking of the colliery was commenced in 1911 by the Manvers Main Colliery Company of Wath-upon-Dearne. The sinking reached the Barnsley seam in 1914 and later the Parkgate seam was reached. The colliery was adjacent to the Dearne Valley Railway to which it was connected but in 1924 a private line was constructed between Barnburgh and the Manvers complex. On 24 April 1942, the mine suffered a collapse in the Park Gate coal seam. Miners reported that the floor rose up towards the ceiling. Geologists put forward the theory that the downward pressure caused the floor to be forced upwards. 18 miners were sealed in and despite frantic rescue efforts, four men died. The last two bodies were located and removed from the pit on 30 April 1942 some six days after the disaster. In 1947 Barnburgh was, as with other mines, nationalized, becoming part of the National Coal Board. On 26 June 1957 an explosion at the colliery caused the death of 6 underground workers and severe burning to 14 others. The explosion was caused by firedamp ignited by a 'flash' from a damaged cable. The colliery was closed on 16 June 1989. ==References== Category:Underground mines in England Category:Coal mines in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley ","title":"Barnburgh Main Colliery"},{"id":"9141540","text":"Carlo Ruzzini (11 November 1653 ‚Äì 5 January 1735) was a Venetian diplomat, statesman, and Doge. ==Biography== Ruzzini was born in Venice, the eldest child of wealthy parents, Marco Ruzzini and Caterina Zeno. By the end of the 17th century the Republic of Venice was losing ground in its constant diplomatic and military struggle with the Turkish Empire, so there was great need for diplomats such as Carlo Ruzzini who had both the education and the requisite personal fortune to qualify for the diplomatic service. Starting his career of public service at 26 running the Venetian Arsenal and dockyard, Carlo Ruzzini became a diplomat and was sent as Ambassador to Madrid in 1691. As the ambassador to Vienna, in July 1698 he was organizing the visit of the Russian Tsar Peter the Great to Venice, but that tour was failed because of the Streltsy revolt in Moscow. Later Ruzzini represented Venice during the negotiations at Carlowitz (1698-1699), managing to obtain some advantages for his country. His indecision and fear of making the wrong decision - partly due to his brief and the need to constantly consult the Venetian Council - caused much irritation with the other participants who, therefore, contrived to exclude Venice and him from the more important decisions. This episode however did not stunt his career, as is demonstrated later by his appointment first as Venetian Ambassador in the Hague (1706), to the Turkish Court (1707) and in Vienna. He was Venice's Ambassador Extraordinary at other important international negotiations such as at Utrecht in 1712. However, Venice's decline and the fact that its power was now largely restricted to within the Italian border meant that his part was a minor one. At the conclusion of the last of the wars between Venice and Turkey (1714‚Äì1718), Ruzzini represented the Republic during the peace negotiations at Passarowitz in July 1718. The inherent weakness in Venice's strategic position meant that little was gained and much lost in the negotiations. After the Treaty of Passarowitz Ruzzini continued his diplomatic career with a second posting to Constantinople before ill health forced him home. However, his wide experience meant he continued to play an important part in the political life of the Republic. He was a candidate for Doge in 1722 but was beaten by Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo. Ten years later, on 6 June 1732,From ‚ÄúA New Chronology of Venetian Opera and Related Genres, 1660-1760,‚Äù pg. 431, by Eleanor Selfridge-Field, published by Stanford University Press, 2007. on Mocenigo's death, Ruzzini was easily elected with 40 votes out of 41. During his brief reign he achieved little of note but kept Venice neutral and out of further conflicts. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:1653 births Category:1735 deaths Category:Ambassadors of the Republic of Venice to Spain Category:Ambassadors of the Republic of Venice to Austria Category:Baili of Constantinople Category:People from Venice Category:17th-century Italian people Category:18th-century Italian people Category:18th-century diplomats Category:18th-century Doges of Venice Category:Republic of Venice people of the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wars ","title":"Carlo Ruzzini"},{"id":"9141546","text":"OBM may refer to: * Of Blessed Memory, an honorific used in Judaism when naming and speaking of the deceased. * Old Brewery Mission, a homeless shelter located in Montreal. * Organizational Behavior Management, applying the study of behavior to organizations to promote worker safety and other benefits * Original brand manufacturer, a company that sells a product made in whole or in part by a second company as its own branded product * Outboard motor, a propulsion system for boats * OBM, in steelmaking \\"Oxygen Blowing Machine\\", (also Oxygen-Bottom-Maxh√ºtte, Oxygen-Bodenblas-Metallurgie German), a process in Steelmaking * Official Bowl Makers, those professionally certified to craft bowls. * Oliver Batista Meier, a German professional footballer ","title":"OBM"},{"id":"9141550","text":"Rodrigo Sequeira Badilla (born June 22, 1957) is a retired football (soccer) referee from Costa Rica, best known for supervising three matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in the United States: The Group D Nigeria-Bulgaria match, the Group C Spain-Bolivia match, and the Brazil-Netherlands quarterfinal.RSSSF. \\"World Cup 1994 finals\\".

RLC is a member of the Canadian Accredited Independent Schools (CAIS), and the Conference of Independent Schools of Ontario Athletic Association (CISAA). The mission statement for RLC is graduate students with a strong personal brand through a culture that is rich in discovery. The average class size is between 10 and 15 students; however mandatory class sizes can be upwards of 20+ students while electives have run with as few as 2 or 3. The current property on which the school resides was given to the school by then owners, Roger Morris and Maurice East and the school was originally named Rosseau Lake School when it was founded in 1967. It began as an all-boys boarding school. The first Headmaster was Ronald H. Perry, who left retirement to rise to the challenge of creating this new school. In 1983, it became a co-educational school. ==Sports == Sports are mandatory for all students between 3:15pm and 4:15pm. Students can pick from a variety of sports throughout the school year. Sports and athletic activities at RLC include Soccer, Volleyball, Field Hockey, Basketball, Mountain Biking, Nordic Skiing, Snowboarding, Rugby, Rugby, and the Whitewater Team. The school has three sports term and they are: Fall (September to November), Winter (November to March), and Spring (March to May). At the end of each term there is an awards ceremony. Coaches of the teams (usually teachers) pick the best or most qualified athletes for the awards. Awards range from MIP (Most Improved Player), MVP (Most Valuable Player), Coaches awards, and the athletic 'R'. ==Events== The annual \\"Scholars' Dinner\\" is held in January each year. The Guest Speaker for the 2007 dinner was the Government of Canada's Minister of the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario and Federal Minister of Health, Tony Clement. Before Clement was elected to the Canadian Parliament he served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing in 1999 and then in 2001 as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. The event has not run in recent years. Each year, RLC hosts a Winter Carnival, which is attended by many alumni, parents and friends of RLC (as well as students). The Carnival includes activities such as the polar bear dip, skating, hockey, toboganning, dogsledding, face painting, and snow sculptures. RLC has an annual marathon, The Hekkla. The Hekkla is a mandatory run/walk/bike for all students attending RLC. It consists of an 18 km run/walk/jog or a 28 km bike. There is a three- hour time limit that the students have to complete the 'race'. The Hekkla is a challenge for all students but for those that think that they cannot make it in the three hours, there is a group that leaves an hour earlier than the rest. The Hekkla is held annually during the month of April before the black flies come out. All students that participate in the Hekkla are rewarded with a barbecue dinner; students making it under the time of 1:45 for the boys and 1:55 for the girls get a surf and turf dish. ==Boarding houses== There are three different houses within which students may board: Bricks: Head House Parent: Mrs. Cathy Christopher.

He also took part in the bombing of the newspaper Cumhuriyet along with Osman Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m, ƒ∞smail Saƒüƒ±r, and Erhan Timuroƒülu. All of these events took place from 10‚Äì17 May 2006. == Biography == Arslan comes from a conservative family. He graduated from Marmara University's law school in 1998. Later on he met fellow Ergenekon suspect Sedat Peker and engaged in financial fraud. Arslan attended meetings of the Vatansever Kuvvetler G√º√ß Birliƒüi Hareketi (founded 2005) with Muzaffer Tekin.Hurriyet Daily News, 24 May 2006, press scanner. Quote: \\"In direct opposition to Arslan's denial of any connections with former Lt. Col. Muzaffer Tekin, the imprisoned lawyer's father, Idris Arslan, said: 'My son changed a lot after meeting Muzaffer Tekin. He began to go back and forth, attending Patriotic Forces Strength Union meetings with him. I spoke to his friends; my son was under Tekin's control, and was being directed by him. I think he committed this act under threat. I used to hear from my son's circle of friends that Tekin had connections to a retired-high level member of the military.'\\" == Council of State attack == On 17 May 2006, Arslan killed Council of State member Mustafa Y√ºcel √ñzbilgin. His stated motive was that the Council disrespected the devout, citing alleged oppression of women who cover their hair; a wedge issue at the time. Allegations surfaced that this was a false flag attack by neonationalists, and Arslan was recruited for the job. After the attack, the newspaper and his family reported conflicting information over his motives, with progressives blaming conservatives and vice versa. His father, ƒ∞dris Arslan, also made inconsistent statements to the press. He was said to have been incited by retired captain Muzaffer Tekin. When his arrest warrant was issued, Tekin attempted suicide. Also detained was major Zekeriya √ñzt√ºrk. After recuperating, Tekin admitted knowing Arslan, and together attending a 2004 meeting of the neonationalist Association for the Union of Patriotic Forces (). Records indicated that the two had made 27 telephone calls between 2004-2006. Tekin said this was related to business they conducted at Doƒüu≈ü Factoring, which Arslan was the legal counsel to. It turned out the company's owner, Ayhan Parlak, had written Arslan a check (cheque) for 20,000 Lira before the attack. Parlak was detained for his. Both he and Arslan insisted the check was for legal services rendered. Records showed that Parlak called Tekin 63 times, general Veli K√º√ß√ºk three times, and Arslan 56 times‚Äî12 days before the attack. After Tekin was released for lack of evidence, Arslan renounced his earlier statements that he had acted in a personal capacity, this time blaming his lawyer, S√ºleyman Esen. Arslan said that Esen and a sheikh they allegedly visited together, Salih Kurter, influenced him. At one point, Arslan stated that his lawyer drugged him and gave him the bombs. Mehmet Ta≈üdelen, the lawyer of another Ergenekon suspect, Emin G√ºrses, vouched for Esen; his childhood friend. According to Ta≈üdelen, Arslan asked an orphan who washed cars called Osman Boz to stage the attack in return for 20,000 USD. Boz allegedly reported the proposition but did not appear as a witness because he was intimidated. At his hearing, Arslan continued to make contradictory statements, and appeared mentally unstable, though he passed a health check. In the meantime, the Ergenekon investigation began. The Ergenekon indictment alleges that there is a connection between numerous attacks in recent years. Moreover, the attacks are alleged to be planned by a group of neonationalist seeking to further discredit Islamists by staging attacks in their name. In a petition to the Ankara court handling the case (the 11th High Criminal Court), suspect Osman Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m wrote that the attack was initiated by Jƒ∞TEM and neonationalists. The court disregarded the petition. Before the trial, he told his lawyer, Mehmet Ener, that Ergenekon made him carry out the attack, and Ener told him to save it for the trial. However, when the trial came, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m did not speak. Arslan was convicted of murder and 4 counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences plus an additional 60 years in prison. The Ankara court requested evidence collected by the Ergenekon prosecutors, and they submitted a 550-page file. However, the file did not contain information that would have enabled the judge to establish a connection between the Council of State bombing and the other ones mentioned in the Ergenekon indictment. So the court concluded that the attack had indeed been carried out Islamists, as originally thought. After the verdict was given, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m lashed out like a religious fundamentalist. == Ergenekon == He was a protected witness in the Ergenekon investigation. == Virdict== On 5 August 2013 Arslan was sentenced to consecutive life sentences as part of the Ergenekon trials.Today's Zaman, 5 August 2013, Long sentences for Ergenekon suspects, life for ex-army chief == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kiƒüƒ± Category:Turkish people of Zaza descent Category:Turkish lawyers Category:Turkish assassins Category:Turkish people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Turkey Category:People convicted in the Ergenekon trials Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Turkey ","title":"Alparslan Arslan"},{"id":"9141643","text":"Dick Jol Dick Jol (born 29 March 1956 in Scheveningen, South Holland) is a Dutch football referee, best known for supervising three matches during the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship held in Belgium and the Netherlands.Bobrowsky, Josef; Beuker, John; Stokkermans, Karel (17 January 2004). \\"European Championship 2000 - Details\\".

He was the leader and founder of the Great Union Party (BBP), a right-wing, nationalist-Islamist political party. ==Biography== Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was born 1954 in a small village named Elmalƒ± in ≈ûarkƒ±≈üla of Sivas Province. He studied in ≈ûarkƒ±≈üla from primary school to high school after that he was educated at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Ankara University. He was a member of Grey Wolves struggling for nationalism during the 1970s. After 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat, he was arrested for being one of the leaders of Grey Wolves. He stayed for 7 years in prison. After the years of imprisonment, he was released in 1987 by being cleared of blame. In the following years, he involved in politics under Nationalist Movement Party. In 1991, he and some of his fellows left this movement and established a new political party called Great Union Party next year. His party has been represented in the Parliament only via electoral coalitions with popular parties. At the 2002 legislative elections, the party won 1.1% of the popular vote and no seats; in the 2007 elections Muhsin Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was elected as an independent. Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu died on March 25, 2009, in a helicopter crash in the south-eastern Turkish province of Kahramanmara≈ü, after a political rally there on the way to the next rally in Yozgat just four days before the local elections. He received a state funeral to which most of the party leaders attended. Thousands of people joined his funeral ceremony in Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara. After his death, in the 2009 local elections the BBP's candidate was elected as the new mayor of Sivas. == Controversies surrounding death == After the helicopter crash, journalist Ismail G√ºne≈ü who was one of the passengers, called the Turkish emergency service number 112 and was able to talk to the dispatcher clearly. He explained how the helicopter fell in a way which made some people believe that the crash was more of an assassination than an accident. According to Ismail G√ºne≈ü's autopsy his chin was broken after the crash, suggesting he wouldn't have been able to talk to the dispatcher. Locals and soldiers searched for the corpses for 48 hours until the bodies were found. A Turkish magazine called Aksiyon Magazine also published a special file on the blood of the deceased that there was carbon monoxide before the helicopter fell. According to K√∂ksal Akpƒ±nar, it was proven that the carbon monoxide values in the blood of pilot Kaya ƒ∞stekte and journalist ƒ∞smail G√ºne≈ü were much higher when the helicopter was falling. There is a tape illustrating Sergeant Aydƒ±n √ñzsƒ±cak dismantling the GPS of the helicopter. This tape was denied by the then-Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. However, after the failed military coup in 2016, President Erdoƒüan published the video since Aydƒ±n √ñzsƒ±cak was one of the sergeants who tried to overthrow Erdoƒüan during the coup. Today, the reason for the accident still remains a mystery. == References == Category:1954 births Category:2009 deaths Category:People from ≈ûarkƒ±≈üla Category:Turkish Sunni Muslims Category:Turkish veterinarians Category:Great Unity Party politicians Category:Deputies of Sivas Category:Grey Wolves (organization) members Category:Leaders of political parties in Turkey Category:Victims of helicopter accidents or incidents Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Turkey Category:Members of the 23rd Parliament of Turkey Category:Members of the 20th Parliament of Turkey ","title":"Muhsin Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu"},{"id":"9141749","text":"Castle Hill Hospital is an NHS hospital to the west of Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, and is run by Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. ==History== Hull Sanatorium, designed by Joseph Hirst, was built on the site of Cottingham Castle, a large castellated mansion which had burnt down in 1861, between 1913 and 1916.

LFA-1 plays a key role in emigration, which is the process by which leukocytes leave the bloodstream to enter the tissues. LFA-1 also mediates firm arrest of leukocytes. Additionally, LFA-1 is involved in the process of cytotoxic T cell mediated killing as well as antibody mediated killing by granulocytes and monocytes. As of 2007, LFA-1 has 6 known ligands: ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, ICAM-4, ICAM-5, and JAM-A. LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions have recently been shown to stimulate signaling pathways that influence T cell differentiation. LFA-1 belongs to the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules. == Structure == LFA-1 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein with non-covalently linked subunits. LFA-1 has two subunits designated as the alpha subunit and beta subunit. The alpha subunit was named aL in 1983. The alpha subunit is designated CD11a; and the beta subunit, unique to leukocytes, is beta-2 or CD18. The ICAM binding site is on the alpha subunit. The general binding region of the alpha subunit is the I-domain. Due to the presence of a divalent cation site in the I-domain, the specific binding site is often referred to as the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). == Activation == In an inactive state, LFA-1 rests in a bent conformation and has a low affinity for ICAM binding. This bent conformation conceals the MIDAS. Chemokines stimulate the activation process of LFA-1. The activation process begins with the activation of Rap1, an intracellular g-protein. Rap1 assists in breaking the constraint between the alpha and beta subunits of LFA-1. This induces an intermediate extended conformation. The conformational change stimulates a recruitment of proteins to form an activation complex. The activation complex further destabilizes the alpha and beta subunits. Chemokines also stimulate an I-like domain on the beta subunit, which causes the MIDAS site on the beta subunit to bind to glutamate on the I domain of the alpha subunit. This binding process causes the beta subunit to pull down the alpha 7 helix of the I domain, exposing and opening up the MIDAS site on the alpha subunit for binding. This causes LFA-1 to undergo a conformational change to the fully extended conformation. The process of activating LFA-1 is known as inside out signaling, which causes LFA-1 to shift from low affinity to high affinity by opening the ligand-binding site. == Discovery == Early discovery of cellular adhesion molecules involved the use of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit cellular adhesion processes. The antigen that bound to the monoclonal antibodies was identified as an important molecule in cellular recognition processes. These experiments yielded the protein name ‚Äúintegrin‚Äù as a description of the proteins' integral role in cellular adhesion processes and the transmembrane association between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. LFA-1, a leukocyte integrin, was first discovered by Timothy Springer in mice in the 1980s. == Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) == Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is an immunodeficiency caused by the absence of key adhesion surface proteins, including LFA-1. LAD is a genetic defect caused by autosomal recessive genes. The deficiency causes ineffective migration and phagocytosis for impacted leukocytes. Patients with LAD also have poorly functioning neutrophils. LAD1, a subtype of LAD, is caused by a lack of integrins that contain the beta subunit, including LFA-1. LAD1 is characterized by recurring bacterial infection, delayed (>30 days) separation of umbilical cord, ineffective wound healing and pus formation, and granulocytosis. LAD1 is caused by low expression of CD11 and CD18. CD18 is found on chromosome 21 and CD11 is found on chromosome 16. == See also == * Leukocyte adhesion deficiency * Lifitegrast, a drug that blocks LFA-1 from binding to ICAM-1 == References == == Further reading == * Janeway, Travers, Walport, Shlomchik, Immunobiology 6th ed.

It has its roots in the military moves, sports games, and dances celebrated during holidays in the Middle Ages. Georgian dance was popularized by Iliko Sukhishvili and his wife, Nino Ramishvili, founders of the Georgian National Ballet. Two folk dances, Perkhuli and Khorumi, are inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list. ==Types of Georgian danceKartuli (·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·É£·Éö·Éò)=== Kartuli dance is a romantic/wedding dance. It is performed by a dance couple. During the dance, the man is not allowed to touch the woman and must keep a certain distance from his partner. The man's upper body is motionless at all times. It shows that even in love, men must control their feelings. The man focuses his eyes on his partner as if she were the only woman in the whole world. The woman keeps her eyes downcast at all times and glides on the rough floor as a swan on the smooth surface of a lake. There have been only a few great performers of Kartuli including Nino Ramishvili, Iliko Sukhishvili, Iamze Dolaberidze and Pridon Sulaberidze. ===Khorumi (·ÉÆ·Éù·É†·É£·Éõ·Éò)=== This war dance originated in Guria/Adjara, in southwestern Georgia, based on the numerous invasions of the country. The dance was originally performed by only a few men. However, over time it has grown. In today's version of Khorumi, 30-40 dancers can participate, as long as the number is odd. The dance has four parts: a search for the a campsite, the reconnoiter of the enemy camp, the fight, and the victory and its celebration. It is strong and simple but distinctive movements and the exactness of lines create a sense of awe on stage. The dance incorporates the themes of search, war, and the celebration of victory as well as courage and glory of Georgian soldiers. Khorumi is traditionally accompanied by instruments, and is not accompanied by clapping. Drum (doli) and the bagpipe (chiboni) are two key instruments to accompany Khorumi. Another unique element of Khorumi is that it has a specific rhythm, based on five beat meter (3+2). ===Adjaruli (·Éê·É≠·Éê·É†·É£·Éö·Éò)=== Adjaruli also originated in Adjara, which is where it gets its name. Adjaruli is distinguished from other dances with its colorful costumes and the playful mood that simple but definite movements of both men and women create on stage. The dance is characterized with graceful, soft, and playful flirtation between the males and females. Unlike Kartuli, the relationship between men and women in this dance is more informal and lighthearted. ===Partsa (·É§·Éê·É†·É™·Éê)=== Partsa originated in Guria and is characterized by its fast pace, rhythm, festive mood, and colorfulness. Partsa mesmerizes the audience with not only speed and gracefulness, but also with \\"live towers.\\" ===Kazbeguri (·Éß·Éê·Éñ·Éë·Éî·Éí·É£·É†·Éò)=== Kazbeguri originated in the Kazbegi Municipality in Caucasus Mountains of Georgia. The dance was created to portray relatively cold and rough atmosphere of the mountains, shown through the vigor and the strictness of the movements and foot stomping. This dance is performed mainly by men. Costumes are a long black coloured shirt, black trousers, a pair of black boots, and black headgear. Musical instruments include bagpipes, a panduri, a changi, and drums. ===Khanjluri (·ÉÆ·Éê·Éú·ÉØ·Éö·É£·É†·Éò)=== Khanjluri is based on the idea of competition. Khanjluri is one of those dances. In this dance, shepherds, dressed in red chokhas (traditional men's wear) compete with each other in the usage of daggers and in performing complicated movements. One performer replaces another, and the courage and skill overflow on stage. Since Khanjluri involves daggers and knives, it requires tremendous skill and practice on the part of the performers. ===Khevsuruli (·ÉÆ·Éî·Éï·É°·É£·É†·É£·Éö·Éò)=== This mountain dance unites love, courage, respect for women, toughness, competition, skill, beauty, and colorfulness into one performance. The dance starts out with a flirting couple. Unexpectedly, another young man appears, also seeking the hand of the woman. Vigorous fighting between the two men and their supporters ensues. The quarrel is stopped temporarily by the woman's veil. Traditionally, when a woman throws her head veil between two men, all disagreements and fighting halts. However, as soon as the woman leaves the scene, the fighting continues. The young men from both sides attack each other with swords and shields. On some occasions, one man has to fight off 3 attackers. At the end, a woman (or women) comes in and stops the fighting with her veil once again. However, the finale of the dance is \\"open\\" ‚Äìmeaning that the audience does not know the outcome of the fighting. Khevsuruli is very technical and requires intense practice and utmost skill in order to perform the dance without hurting anyone. ===Mtiuluri (·Éõ·Éó·Éò·É£·Éö·É£·É†·Éò)=== Mtiuluri is also a mountain dance. Similar to Khevsuruli, Mtiuluri is also based on competition. However, in this dance, the competition is mainly between two groups of young men and is a celebration of skill and art. At first, groups compete in performing complicated movements. Then, the girl's dance, which is followed by an individual dancer's performance of amazing \\"tricks\\" on their knees and toes. At the end, everyone dances a beautiful finale. This dance is reminiscent of a festival in the mountains. ===Simd and Khonga=== Ossetian folk dances. The costumes in both dances are distinguished with long sleeves. The headwear of both the women and the men are exceptionally high. However, in Khonga or Invitation Dance (Ossetian Wedding Dance), men dance on demi-pointe, entirely on the balls of their feet. Khonga is performed by a few dancers and is characterized by the grace and softness of the movements. Simd is danced by many couples. The beauty of Simd is in the strict graphic outline of the dance, the contrast between black and white costumes, the softness of movements, and the strictness of line formations. ===Kintouri (·Éô·Éò·Éú·É¢·Éù·É£·É†·Éò) and Shalakho=== Kintouri portrays the city life in old Tbilisi. The dance takes its name after \\"Kintos\\" who were small merchants in Tbilisi. They wore black outfits with baggy pants and usually carried their goods on their heads around the city. When a customer chose goods, a kinto would take the silk shawl hanging from his silver belt and wrap the fruits and vegetables in them to weigh. Kintos were known to be cunning, swift and informal. Such characteristics of Kinto are well shown in Kintouri. The dance is light natured. ===Samaia (·É°·Éê·Éõ·Éê·Éò·Éê)=== Samaia is performed by 3 women and, originally, was considered to be a Paganism dance. However, today's Samaia is a representation of Tamar of Georgia, who reigned in 12th-13th centuries and was the first woman king of Georgia. There are only 4 frescos that keep the much- revered image of King Tamar. Simon Virsaladze based the costumes of Samaia on the King's clothing on those frescos. In addition, the trinity idea in the dance represents Tamar of Georgia as a young princess, a wise mother and the powerful king. All these three images are united in one harmonious picture. The simple but soft and graceful movements create an atmosphere of beauty, glory and power that surrounded the King's reign. ===Jeirani (·ÉØ·Éî·Éò·É†·Éê·Éú·Éò)=== The word \\"jeirani\\" means gazelle. This dance tells the story of the hunt. It was choreographed by Nino Ramishvili for the Georgian National Ballet. The dance incorporates classical ballet movements and a hunting scene. ===Karachokheli (·Éß·Éê·É†·Éê·É©·Éù·ÉÆ·Éî·Éö·Éò)=== Karachokheli were the ordinary craftsman of Georgia. They typically wore black chokha (traditional men's wear). They were known for hard work yet a carefree life, as well as a love of Georgian wine and beautiful women, all of which are well represented in the dance. ===Davluri (·Éì·Éê·Éï·Éö·É£·É†·Éò)=== Davluri is also a city dance, but unlike Kintouri and Karachokheli, it portrays the city aristocracy. The dance is similar to Kartuli. However, the movements in Davluri are less complicated and the male/female relationship is less formal. The dance is performed by many couples and with the music and colorful costumes, paints a picture of an aristocratic feast on stage. ===Mkhedruli=== The word \\"Mkhedari\\" means cavalryman. The dance begins in a raging tempo, becoming more and more violent. The legs of the cavalryman imitate the fast movements of the horse, while their body and arm movements impersonate the battle with enemy. ===Parikaoba=== A warrior dance from Khevsureti in northeast Georgia. A girl enters, looking for her beloved. He appears only to encounter others, precipitating an energetic battle with sword and shield. When the girl throws down her headdress, the men must stop according to tradition, only to renew their battle soon after. ==Gallery== Image:Svan dance.jpgSvanuri Image:Georgian dance 7.jpgAcharuli Image:Erisioni at Rustaveli Theatre.jpgAcharuli Image:Mtiuluri.jpgMtiuluri ==References== ","title":"Georgian dance"},{"id":"9141834","text":"Abu Naser Muhammad Gaziul Haque (13 February 1929 ‚Äì 17 June 2009) was a language activist and an activist leader during the Bengali Language Movement. == Early life and education== Haque was born in Nichintapur village of Chhagalnaiya Upazila in Feni district to Nurjahan Begum and Sirajul Haque.

As he grew up he never used the name G√•s- Anders, and it was not until the 1920s that folk musicians started referring to him by that name, which was by now used as a positive epithet rather than a slur. Although G√•s-Anders made his living by working as a day labourer at the farms around Bj√∂rklige, he was known as a poor worker who usually brought his fiddle with him and played rather than worked. As a spelman he was very popular and extremely skilled, and it was said that nobody could sit still when he played dancing music ‚Äì not even he himself. As he played he would jump around, dancing on chairs and tables. Rumour had it that N√§cken had taught him to play, signing a contract in blood on human bones from the churchyard. According to the stories, G√•s-Anders played the polska he had learnt from N√§cken on his death bed, after which all four strings on his fiddle broke and he was able to die in peace. Another story had it that G√•s-Anders's wife once put a Bible on top of his fiddle, and after that it would never stay tuned. G√•s-Anders left a legacy of folk music, upwards of 150 different melodies; both tunes he himself had written and those he had learnt from other fiddlers. Most of the tunes are eighth-note polskas. Since fiddlers at the time played by ear, not from written music (something which is true for traditional folk musicians today as well), much of G√•s-Anders's music was never saved for posterity. Towards the end of his life he got rather deaf and had to bring a helper to tune his fiddle, but he kept playing at weddings and dances up until the final years of his life. He was a poor man when he died, and was buried in the communal part of the churchyard in Bj√∂rklinge. The exact location of his grave in the churchyard is unknown. In 1944, a statue of G√•s-Anders, created by the sculptor Bror Hjorth, was erected next to Bj√∂rklinge church. == References == Category:1815 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Nordic folk musicians Category:Swedish male musicians ","title":"Anders Ljungqvist"},{"id":"9141890","text":"The Beverley 20 is a walk in the East Riding of Yorkshire that runs between Beverley Minster and the Humber Bridge that pass through the local villages of Skidby and North Ferriby.

It is the first book in the Kang's Regiment series/The Chaos War series of the Dragonlance novels, followed by Draconian Measures. == Plot summary == The Doom Brigade chronicles the former First Dragonarmy Engineering Regiment's quest to recover the first female draconians on Krynn after the War of the Lance. The brigade has left the dragonarmies in search for a new life, and led by Commander Kang, a Bozak, and Subcommander Slith, they have set up a small town in the valleys below the Kharolis Mountains. Unfortunately, their neighbors are hill dwarves in the town of Celebundin, who are not very receptive to the idea of Draconian neighbours. For the last twenty five years, raids have occurred every couple of weeks, whether the draconians are short on dwarf spirits, or the dwarves are short on other supplies. However, they have grown to respect each other, and so have made a silent pact to only use blunt weapons, so that the victim is only knocked out or stunned. While en route to raiding the dwarves one day, one of Kang's scouts reports a pair of red dragons on the horizon. Kang, curious, leads his troops to a pass on the outskirts of the Plains of Dust, where he meets Talon Leader Huzzud. Huzzud, a Knight of the Lily, is a talon leader for the Fifth Dragonarmy, which is led by General Ariakan. She proposes that Kang and his regiment join their army to retake Ansalon, but Kang decides to inspect their camp first. After inspecting the armies' camp and speaking to their commander, Kang realizes that this force does not consist of untamed goblins like in the previous war, but a well-trained and deadly force of knights. He realizes that since draconians cannot breed, it would be better to die fighting then to just slowly fade away. On that note, he signs himself and his regiment up. Soon after, they are called to assist the dragonarmy in the conquering of Qualinost. Once they arrive, they are ordered to report for latrine duty. Disgusted, Kang's regiment revolts, and returns to their town. On their return, however, they find their village in flames. They slaughter any dwarves that they can find in their village, and nail their bodies to posts. Meanwhile, four dwarves who regularly make trips to search for riches, Pestle, Mortar, Auger and Selquist discover a map leading to the lost treasures of Neraka while raiding Thorbardin through a secret passage. Plotting revenge, Kang orders a small group of five draconians, including himself and Slith, to enter the dwarven town to find out who burned down their village. Slith and the other three shape shift into dwarven guards, while Kang turns invisible. However, when the dwarves discover one of the draconians, the five beat a hasty retreat. Slith managed to steal a book with the map secreted within it from Selquist before they retreated; however, Selquist now pursues the draconians. After he catches Kang, he drives a knife into Kang's leg, temporarily crippling him. The dwarf and the draconians squabble over the book, ending up with the dwarf regaining the book, but the draconians keeping the cover, which has the map hidden inside it. The draconians retreat into their camp, unbeknownst to the fact they have the map to the Nerakan treasures. A few days later, Selquist appears at the draconian camp, begging Kang to remove a curse which he believes has been put on him. Kang does so after being told that the map leads to unhatched draconian females. Knowing that \\"rescuing\\" the females is the only way to continue their own race, Kang and twenty-four other draconians set out to retrieve the eggs. Unfortunately, the four dwarves decide to destroy the eggs and steal the treasure. Joined by a retinue from Moorthane, the dwarven war chief, and twenty guards, the dwarves set out. For many days and nights, Kang's regiment follow the dwarves. Just before entering Thorbardin, however, Kang is visited by Huzzud, who warns him that the Dark Queen wishes him to complete some great task before he gains the eggs. Unable to be told more, Kang leaves Huzzud. After traveling for a long while in the tunnels of Thorbardin, the dwarves stumble upon a grell. Grells are large, green octopus-like creatures that float above the ground who live underground. Unfortunately, this one has a wand of The Dark Queen. After a long battle, the draconians join in, slaying the grell and taking the wand. Later, just before reaching their goal, they stumble on a lair of rock and molten lava. Out of the lava rises a massive fire dragon, made out of chaos, which if unstopped, would destroy all of Krynn. Kang realizes that this was the grand test that he had been assigned, and orders his regiment back. Kang almost dies battling the dragon, until he uses the wand to create water to cool himself and solidify the creature. He then creates mud to bury it, gaining himself and his regiment precious time; unfortunately, there's actually an entire nest. While the draconians (who join Kang) are battling the dragons, the dwarves move into the treasure room. After losing a good number of men to the dragons, Kang realizes the only way to defeat them. He orders his regiment back, and commands the wand to cause the stalagmites from the roof to fall into the nest. The wand obeys, and Kang rushes for the exit. He barely makes it, but weak and injured, he falls unconscious. After waking, he discovers he's trapped, until he hears Slith's voice through the rocks. Heartened, the draconians dig through the rocks to rescue Kang. It is then they realize that they are only 100 odd meters away from the eggs. After realizing this, they rush forward, only to find the dwarves about to kill the young. After negotiating, they reach an agreement. Kang's regiment shows the dwarves the way out of Thorbardin and the draconians keep the young and move out of the valley. The novel ends with Selquist, too injured carry his treasure, bargaining with Gloth ( a draconian subcommander ), over a map to an abandoned city just south of Nordmaar. ==Reception== ==References== Category:1996 American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Dragonlance novels Category:Novels by Margaret Weis ","title":"The Doom Brigade"},{"id":"9141904","text":"The Tamaddun Majlish (), formerly Pakistan Tamaddun Majlish, is an Islamic cultural organization in Bangladesh, established in 1947 by Principal Abul Kashem in the former East Pakistan. It was one of the founding organizations of the Bengali Language Movement. ==Establishment and ideological background== Tamaddun Majlish was established in Dhaka immediately after the partition of India on September 1, 1947, by Principal Abul Kashem, a professor in the physics department of Dhaka University. At first it was very active, playing a vital role at the start of the Bengali Language Movement. The members of the organization were strongly influenced by the mentality of the East Pakistan Renaissance Society. After the partition, they realized that Pakistan was no longer governed with the idealism that had been promised. This led most of the members of the Tamuddun Majlish to drift away from the Muslim League. ==Involvement in the Bengali Language Movement== Although the main intent of Tamaddun Majlish was to invigorate the Islamic spirit and culture of the new nation of Pakistan, the vigorous role played by this pro-Islamic organization made it clear to the Bengali-speaking Muslim population of East Pakistan that the demand to adopt Bengali as one of the state languages was \\"not at all motivated by the anti-state elements and communists of East Bengal.\\" On September 15, 1947, Tamuddun Majlish issued a pamphlet titled Pakistaner Rashtra Bhasha: Bangla Na Urdu? (\\"Pakistan‚Äôs State Language: Bengali or Urdu?\\"). The authors, Kazi Motahar Hossain, Abul Mansur Ahmed and Principal Abul Kashem (General Secretary of Tamuddun Majlish), made a strong case for introducing Bengali as the only language of instruction, offices and courts of East Bengal. They also forcefully articulated the demand for Bengali to be one of the State languages of Pakistan. The seminal booklet also contained a succinct proposal, authored by Principal Abul Kashem in favor of the Bengali language, the gist of which is: # Bengali should be: ## the medium of instruction in East Pakistan; ## the court language of East Pakistan; and ## the official language of East Pakistan. # Urdu and Bengali should be the two official languages of the central government of Pakistan. # Bengali should be the first language for the purpose of education in East Pakistan, to be learned by all the people; ## Urdu may be treated as the second language or inter-province language in East Pakistan, which can be taught as a second language to those people who will be working in West Pakistan. It will be more than adequate if Urdu is learned by only 5% to 10% of population of East Pakistan. Urdu may be taught in higher classes at the secondary school level in East Pakistan; and ## English should be the third or international language of East Pakistan. # Both English and Bengali should be used for a few years as the official languages in East Pakistan.\\" Umar, Badruddin.

While Professor Nurul Huque Bhuyain of Dhaka University was elected to be the Convenor of the first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad, Professor Abul Kashem, the General Secretary of Tamudhun Majlish, played a key role in the early stages of the Bengali Language Movement by garnering widespread support for adopting Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan. He succeeded in enlisting the younger generations, and in particular the teachers and students of Dhaka University and other educational institutions. Thus, the first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad provided the organizational structure needed to launch the language movement in the latter part of 1947 and the early months of 1948.Manik, Dr. M.

The protest meeting attracted a large number of students, teachers and others from Dhaka University and other educational institutions. Professor Abul Kashem presided over the protest meeting, and a number of students and teachers including Munir Choudhury, Abdur Rahman, Kallayan Dasgupta, A.K.M. Ahsan, S.

Dr. Mustard, with support from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, developed an alternative and simplified technique to the Senning procedure which was used to correct a congenital heart defect that produced ‚Äúblue babies‚Äù. The technique was adopted by other surgeons and became the standard operation for d-TGA. In his autobiography, South African cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard claims to have been the first to perform the operation, with Mustard only following 'several years later'.Barnard, Christiaan N. (1969). One Life. Bantam. p. 213. == Background == The defect is called transposition of the great vessels, or transposition of the great arteries (TGV or TGA). Until the late 1950s, and Senning's operation the condition was commonly fatal. The defect causes blood from the lungs to flow back to the lungs and blood from the body to flow back to the body. This occurs because the aorta and the pulmonary artery, the two major arteries coming out of the heart, are connected to the wrong chambers. The babies look blue because there is insufficient oxygen circulating in their bodies. == Procedure == The Mustard Procedure allows total correction of transposition of the great vessels. The procedure employs a baffle to redirect caval blood flow to the left atrium which then pumps blood to the left ventricle which then pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In a normal heart, de-oxygenated blood is pumped into the lungs via the right ventricle. Then it is distributed throughout the body via the left ventricle. In the Mustard procedure, blood is pumped to the lungs via the left ventricle and disseminated throughout the body via the right ventricle. ==Superseded by Arterial Switch== The Mustard procedure was largely replaced in the late 1980s by the Jatene procedure (arterial switch), in which the native arteries were switched back to normal flow, so that the RV (right ventricle) would be connected to the pulmonary artery and the LV (left ventricle) would be connected to the aorta. This surgery had not been possible prior to 1975 because of difficulty with re-implanting coronary arteries which perfuse the actual heart muscle itself (myocardium), and even after it was first performed the excellent results from the Mustard operation meant that it was a long time before the Jatene procedure took over. ==Long-term survival== The Mustard procedure improved an 80% mortality rate in the first year of life to an 80% survival at age 20. Long-term follow-up studies now extend to more than 40 years post- operationhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2015/07/16/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.010770 and there are numerous patients thriving in their 50s. A Facebook group, Mustard or Senning Survivors, gathers several hundred global survivors in their 20s to 50s into a single community, supporting adults born with TGA that have had a Mustard, Senning, Rastelli or Nikaidoh heart procedure. ==See also== * Congenital heart disease * Blalock Hanlon Procedure ==References== Category:Cardiac surgery ","title":"Mustard procedure"},{"id":"9141936","text":"Andrew Supanz (born 1982 in Perth, Western Australia) is an Australian actor.

The earliest forms of step well and reservoir were also built in India in places like Dholavira as far back as the Indus Valley Civilisation. ==Architecture== This Baoli, with 108 steps, is among a few of its kind in Delhi. The visible parts of this historical step well consist of three levels. Each level is lined with arched niches on both sides.Panoramic shot of Agrasen ki Baoli, with the arches visible. == In popular culture == The location has been used to shoot scenes from various Bollywood films such as the blockbuster film PK starring Aamir Khan and Sultan starring Salman Khan. It was also featured in the 2017 Sridevi thriller Mom. There have also been reports of the Baoli being haunted. In 2012, a photo- shoot of Formula One models also took place here.

This has been the successor to the earlier dominant aerodynamic focus on streamlining. American racing IndyCars employ ground effects in their engineering and designs. Similarly, they are also employed in other racing series to some extent; however Formula One and many other racing series, primarily across Europe, employ regulations (or complete bans) to limit its effectiveness on safety grounds. ==Theory== In racing cars, a designer's aim is for increased downforce and grip to achieve higher cornering speeds. A substantial amount of downforce is available by understanding the ground to be part of the aerodynamic system in question, hence the name \\"ground effect\\". Starting in the mid-1960s, 'wings' were routinely used in the design of race cars to increase downforce (this is not a type of ground effect). Designers shifted their efforts at understanding air flow around the perimeter, body skirts, and undersides of the vehicle to increase downforce with less drag than compared to using a wing. This kind of ground effect is easily illustrated by taking a tarpaulin out on a windy day and holding it close to the ground: it can be observed that when close enough to the ground the tarp will be drawn towards the ground. This is due to Bernoulli's principle; as the tarp gets closer to the ground, the cross sectional area available for the air passing between it and the ground shrinks. This causes the air to accelerate and as a result pressure under the tarp drops while the pressure on top is unaffected, and together this results in a net downward force. The same principles apply to cars. The Bernoulli principle is not the only mechanic in generating ground effect downforce. A large part of ground effect performance comes from taking advantage of viscosity. In the tarp example above neither the tarp nor the ground is moving. The boundary layer between the two surfaces works to slow down the air between them which lessens the Bernoulli effect. When a car moves over the ground the boundary layer on the ground becomes helpful. In the reference frame of the car, the ground is moving backwards at some speed. As the ground moves, it pulls on the air above it and causes it to move faster. This enhances the Bernoulli effect and increases downforce. It is an example of Couette flow. While such downforce-producing aerodynamic techniques are often referred to with the catch-all term \\"ground effect\\", they are not strictly speaking a result of the same aerodynamic phenomenon as the ground effect which is apparent in aircraft at very low altitudes. ==History== American Jim Hall built his developed Chaparral cars to both these principles, pioneering them. His 1961 car attempted to use the shaped underside method but there were too many other aerodynamic problems with the car for it to work properly. His 1966 cars used a dramatic high wing for their downforce. His Chaparral 2J \\"sucker car\\" of 1970 was revolutionary. It had two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated two-stroke engine; it also had \\"skirts\\", which left only a minimal gap between car and ground, to seal the cavity from the atmosphere. Although it did not win a race, some competition had lobbied for its ban, which came into place at the end of that year. Movable aerodynamic devices were banned from most branches of the sport. Formula One was the next setting for ground effect in racing cars. Several Formula One designs came close to the ground effect solution which would eventually be implemented by Lotus. In 1968 and 1969, Tony Rudd and Peter Wright at British Racing Motors (BRM) experimented on track and in the wind tunnel with long aerodynamic section side panniers to clean up the turbulent airflow between the front and rear wheels. Both left the team shortly after and the idea was not taken further. Robin Herd at March Engineering, on a suggestion from Wright, used a similar concept on the 1970 March Formula One car. In both cars the sidepods were too far away from the ground for significant ground effect to be generated, and the idea of sealing the space under the wing section to the ground had not yet been developed. At about the same time, Shawn Buckley began his work in 1969 at the Univ. of California - Berkeley on undercar aerodynamics sponsored by Colin Chapman, founder of Formula One Lotus. Buckley had previously designed the first high wing used in an IndyCar, Jerry Eisert's \\"Bat Car\\" of the 1966 Indianapolis 500. By proper shaping of the car's underside, the air speed there could be increased, lowering the pressure and pulling the car down onto the track. His test vehicles had a Venturi-like channel beneath the cars sealed by flexible side skirts that separated the channel from above-car aerodynamics. He investigated how flow separation on the undersurface channel could be influenced by boundary layer suction and divergence parameters of the underbody surface.S. Buckley, \\"Vehicle Surface Interaction\\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California - Berkeley, Sept., 1972B. Shawn Buckley, \\"Road Test Aerodynamic Instrumentation\\", SAE paper 741030, 1974-02-01B. Shawn Buckley, Edmund V. Laitone, \\"Air Flow Beneath an Automobile\\", SAE paper 741028, 1974-02-01 Later, as a mechanical engineering professor at MIT, Buckley worked with Lotus developing the Lotus 78. On a different tack, Brabham designer Gordon Murray used air dams at the front of his Brabham BT44s in 1974 to exclude air from flowing under the vehicle. Upon discovering that these tended to wear away with the pitching movement of the car, he placed them further back and discovered that a small area of negative pressure was formed under the car, generating a useful amount of downforce - around . McLaren produced similar underbody details for their McLaren M23 design. BT46B used a large fan to reduce underbody air pressure. In 1977 Rudd and Wright, now at Lotus, developed the Lotus 78 'wing car', based on a concept from Lotus owner and designer Colin Chapman. Its sidepods, bulky constructions between front and rear wheels, were shaped as inverted aerofoils and sealed with flexible \\"skirts\\" to the ground. The design of the radiators, embedded into the sidepods, was partly based on that of the de Havilland Mosquito aircraft. The team won five races that year, and two in 1978 while they developed the much improved Lotus 79. The most notable contender in 1978 was the Brabham-Alfa Romeo BT46B Fancar, designed by Gordon Murray. Its fan, spinning on a horizontal, longitudinal axis at the back of the car, took its power from the main gearbox. The car avoided the sporting ban by claims that the fan's main purpose was for engine cooling, as less than 50% of the airflow was used to create a depression under the car. It raced just once, with Niki Lauda winning at the Swedish Grand Prix. The car's advantage was proven after the track became oily. While other cars had to slow, Lauda was able to accelerate over the oil due to the tremendous downforce which rose with engine speed. The car was also observed to squat when the engine was revved at a standstill.8W - Why? - Brabham BT46B Brabham's owner, Bernie Ecclestone, who had recently become president of the Formula One Constructors Association, reached an agreement with other teams to withdraw the car after three races. However the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), governing body of Formula One and many other motor sports, decided to ban 'fan cars' with almost immediate effect. The Lotus 79, on the other hand, went on to win six races and the world championship for Mario Andretti and gave teammate Ronnie Peterson a posthumous second place, demonstrating just how much of an advantage the cars had. In following years other teams copied and improved on the Lotus until cornering speeds became dangerously high, resulting in several severe accidents in 1982; flat undersides became mandatory for 1983. Part of the danger of relying on ground effects to corner at high speeds is the possibility of the sudden removal of this force; if the belly of the car contacts the ground, the flow is constricted too much, resulting in almost total loss of any ground effects. If this occurs in a corner where the driver is relying on this force to stay on the track, its sudden removal can cause the car to abruptly lose most of its traction and skid off the track. However, ground effect is set to return to Formula 1 in 2022 under the latest set of regulation changes. The effect was used in its most effective form in IndyCar designs. ==Porpoising== \\"Porpoising\\" is a term that was commonly used to describe a particular fault encountered in ground effect racing cars. Racing cars had only been using their bodywork to generate downforce for just over a decade when Colin Chapman's Lotus 78 and 79 cars demonstrated that ground effect was the future in Formula One, so, at this point, under-car aerodynamics were still very poorly understood. To compound this problem the teams that were keenest to pursue ground effects tended to be the more poorly funded British \\"garagiste\\" teams, who had little money to spare for wind tunnel testing, and tended simply to mimic the front-running Lotuses (including the Kauhsen and Merzario teams). This led to a generation of cars that were designed as much by hunch as by any great knowledge of the finer details, making them extremely pitch-sensitive. As the centre of pressure on the sidepod aerofoils moved about depending on the car's speed, attitude, and ground clearance, these forces interacted with the car's suspension systems, and the cars began to resonate, particularly at slow speeds, rocking back and forth - sometimes quite violently. Some drivers were known to complain of sea- sickness. This rocking motion, like a porpoise diving into and out of the sea as it swims at speed, gives the phenomenon its name. These characteristics, combined with a rock-hard suspension, resulted in the cars giving an extremely unpleasant ride. Ground effects were largely banned from Formula One in the early 1980s, but Group C sportscars and other racing cars continued to suffer from porpoising until better knowledge of ground effects allowed designers to minimise the problem. ==See also== *Automotive aerodynamics *Venturi effect *Ground effect in aircraft *Ground effect train *Formula One car ==References== * * == External links == * Photoessayist.com: The Chaparral 2J * VintageRPM: Chaparral history * 8W: Brabham-Alfa BT46B \\"fan car\\" * Dennis David: Lotus 79 Category:Aerodynamics Category:Motorsport terminology Category:Vehicle dynamics ","title":"Ground effect (cars)"},{"id":"9141965","text":"Moshenskoye () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Moshenskoy District of Novgorod Oblast, Russia, in the east of the oblast, on the Uver River. Municipally, it is the administrative center of Moshenskoye Rural Settlement. Population: ==History== Moshenskoye was first mentioned in chronicles in 1545 as Nikolsky Pogost in Moshna. At the time, it belonged to the Bezhetskaya pyatina of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. One of the waterways between Novgorod and the basin of the Volga River run along the Msta and the Uver, and the foundation of Moshenskoye was presumably related to the existence of this waterway. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate split off. In 1776, the area was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished, and the Nikolo- Moshenskaya Volost of Borovichsky Uyezd, was transferred to Novgorod Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Moshenskoy District was established, with the center in Moshenskoye. The district belonged to Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. On July 5, 1944, Moshenskoy District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast. ==EconomyIndustry=== In the district, there are small- scale enterprises of timber industry and food industry. ===Transportation=== Moshenskoye is connected to the paved road between Pestovo and Borovichi. There also other local roads, as well as local bus traffic. The closest railway station is in the town of Borovichi, to the west of Moshenskoye. The Uver was used as a part of Vyshnevolotsky Canal System constructed in the 18th century to bypass the rapids on the Msta. The system became outdated already in the 19th century and was eventually surpassed by Tikhvinskaya water system and by Mariinsk Canal System. It is not in use anymore. ==Culture and recreation== In Moshenskoye, there are eight objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. These are several former estates and a butter production facility. ==ReferencesNotes=Sources=== * * * Category:Rural localities in Novgorod Oblast ","title":"Moshenskoye, Novgorod Oblast"},{"id":"9141982","text":"The Alto Rhapsody, Op. 53, is a composition for contralto, male chorus, and orchestra by Johannes Brahms, a setting of verses from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Harzreise im Winter. It was written in 1869, as a wedding gift for Robert and Clara Schumann's daughter, Julie. Brahms scholars have long speculated that the composer may have had romantic feelings for Julie, which he may have integrated into the text and music of the Alto Rhapsody. The text, with its metaphysical portrayal of a misanthropic soul who is urged to find spiritual sustenance and throw off the shackles of his suffering, has powerful parallels in Brahms's life and character. The work is in three sections: the first two, in a chromatically dense and wandering C minor, are for the soloist and orchestra and describe the pain of the misanthropic wanderer. The second section is an aria in all but name. The third section, in a nominal C major, brings in the male chorus, which joins the soloist in a plea to a celestial spirit for an abatement of the wanderer's pain. The third part of the Rhapsody has similarities of vocal and choral style to A German Requiem, which was written the previous year. The work typically takes between twelve and fifteen minutes in performance. See recordings, below, for indicative timings. The work was first \\"tried out\\" on 6 October 1869, at the dress rehearsal for the Karlsruhe season's first orchestral subscription concert. Amalia Boni sang the solo part; the conductor Hermann Levi was on hand, but there was no male voice chorus, and it is unclear whether Boni was accompanied by orchestra or simply on piano. Brahms and Clara Schumann were present, but there was certainly no other audience.George S. Bozarth, Brahms Studies It received its first public performance, and its first definitely known proper performance, on 3 March 1870, at Jena. The soloist at the first performance was Pauline Viardot and the conductor was Ernst Naumann.Michael Musgrave, The Cambridge Companion to Brahms The text Brahms set is: { -  :German original  :English translation -  :Aber abseits wer ist's? :Im Geb√ºsch verliert sich sein Pfad; :hinter ihm schlagen die Str√§uche zusammen, :das Gras steht wieder auf, :die √ñde verschlingt ihn.  :But who is that apart? :His path disappears in the bushes; :behind him the branches spring together; :the grass stands up again; :the wasteland engulfs him. -  :Ach, wer heilet die Schmerzen :dess, dem Balsam zu Gift ward? :Der sich Menschenha√ü :aus der F√ºlle der Liebe trank! :Erst verachtet, nun ein Ver√§chter, :zehrt er heimlich auf :seinen eigenen Wert :In ungen√ºgender Selbstsucht.  :Ah, who heals the pains :of him for whom balsam turned to poison? :Who drank hatred of man :from the abundance of love? :First scorned, now a scorner, :he secretly feeds on :his own merit, :in unsatisfying egotism. -  :Ist auf deinem Psalter, :Vater der Liebe, ein Ton :seinem Ohre vernehmlich, :so erquicke sein Herz! :√ñffne den umw√∂lkten Blick :√ºber die tausend Quellen :neben dem Durstenden :in der W√ºste!  :If there is on your psaltery,translations differ on whether ‚Äòauf deinem Psalter‚Äô means ‚Äòon your psaltery‚Äô (an old instrument like a small harp) or ‚Äòin your psalter‚Äô (‚Äòin your book of psalms‚Äô). :Father of love, one note :his ear can hear, :then refresh his heart! :Open his clouded gaze :to the thousand springs :next to him who thirsts :in the wilderness! } Notes ==Recordings== The Alto Rhapsody is not frequently performed in concert, perhaps because of the expense of hiring a soloist and chorus for a short piece, but it has been recorded many times both by contralto and mezzo-soprano singers.

The film is then loaded onto a film reel in a completely dark environment; this can be a light-tight room or a changing bag. Care must be taken during this step, as improperly loading the film may result in parts of the film not getting developed. Once the film is on the reel it is put into the developing tank, and then a lid is placed on the developing tank. Because the lid prevents light from reaching the film, the rest of the film developing process may be carried out in daylight. In addition to protecting the film from light, the lid contains an opening for rapidly pouring liquids into and out of the developing tank. Finally, a separate cap seals the canister, which prevents the contents of the tank from spilling when agitated by inverting the tank.

As of July 2015, she is the Coordinator of the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre (FWCC), a post she has held for many years. She has also been a member of the Fiji Human Rights Commission (FHRC). Ali condemned the military coup of 5 December 2006 and has taken a strong stand against human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by the Military-backed interim government. She has also criticized Shaista Shameem, the Director of the FHRC and a coup-sympathizer, for allegedly ignoring such violations. When six pro-democracy activists were arrested and allegedly assaulted by the Military in the early hours of 25 December 2006, Shameem told her there was nothing the FHRC could do, according to Ali. Ali's position in the FHRC had already been further isolated by the resignation of Sevuloni Valenitabua the previous week. On 28 December, Ali vowed to continue speaking up, though she admitted that she was somewhat fearful. On 31 December, the Fiji Sun quoted her as cautioning against believing the claims of Australian fraudster Peter Foster, which was being cited by the Military administration as implicating the deposed government of Prime Minister of involvement in electoral fraud. Ali spoke out on 4 January 2007 against a report written by Shaista Shameem, condoning and excusing the coup d'√©tat as the removal of an \\"illegally constituted government\\". The report was based on Shameem's personal opinions and was neither commissioned nor sanctioned by the FHRC, Ali claimed. \\"The report by Dr Shameem is not in accordance with Commission procedures and policy and I presume it to be her personal opinion,\\" she said. \\"The report carries numerous errors and fabrications,\\" she added. Ali called on Shameem to resign and declared her intention to consult with her colleagues to explore the possibility of having Shameem dismissed. Ali claimed that her own intervention had secured the release from military custody of Richard Naidu, a prominent lawyer who was detained on 23 January 2007 for making what the Military called \\"inciteful\\" comments on Radio New Zealand. The Military, however, denied that Ali had played a role in the release.

Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Franks, Venetians and Turks have all influenced the cultural heritage of this Mediterranean island. Folklore is extremely important in the Turkish Cypriot culture as it provides unity and identity. Turkish Cypriot folk dances are not only significant because they are liked by the local people but also because they receive much critical acclaim in other parts of the world. Many folk dance groups are routinely representing North Cyprus international festivals throughout the year. Folk dances reflect all details of the Cypriot lifestyle. The dances that are choreographed with the motifs of typical behaviours and traditional occasions, typically focus on notable events. Undoubtedly the most important among these are weddings. In a wedding environment, dances such as 'Karsilama', 'Sirtos', 'Zeybek', 'Ciftetelli' / Arabiyes, and others topical dances. The eagle is the symbolic bird of the island and has always been a part of the lives of Cypriots who appreciate its liberty and adventures called the 'Kartal Oyunu'. The dance of the eagle is performed at the beginning of all the Turkish Cypriot festivals. 'Arabiye' is performed by the females, it is reminiscent of the belly dances performed by women from the not too distant orient but it differs. Pottery is another of the many traditions of Cyprus and is an object of decoration while also serving utilitarian purposes. One of its main tasks of its people is to carry water in an island nation, where ironically, water is rare and precious. The 'Kozan Oyunu' recalls how the women, and sometimes the men when the load is more than the woman can carry, accomplish their tasks and the vicissitudes that mark the paths toward the springs. Besides the dances themselves, the musical instruments used and the costumes are also of interest. Folk dancing one way of gaining a deeper understanding of the Turkish Cypriot lifestyle both past and present. ==International membership== Northern Cyprus became a member of Federation of International Dance Festivals (FIDAF) in 2014.Kibrispostasi 13 October 2014 TRNC became a member of Federation of International Dance Festivals (FIDAF) ==Types of Turkish Cypriot folk dancesKarsƒ±lamas=== Karsilamas or Antikristos: Karsilamas and antikrystos means coming face to face, both in Greek and Turkish language. It is danced by two or more dancers by coming face to face, among whom there exists a very good friendship. This causes a smiling mimic on the dancers' faces because of their happiness of enjoying together. There are separate women karsilamas and men karsilamas. In some karsilamas dancers use a handkerchief and dance by (each of them) holding one side of it. Some dancers might from time to time show their special talents like spinning, jumping, kneeling, or hitting their feet or legs or the ground with their hands in accordance with the rhythm of the music simultaneously with spinning or jumping or kneeling... Karsilamas are named with numbers. Karsilama 1, Karsilama 2, Karsilama 3, Karsilama 4, Women's Karsilama 3, Women's Karsilama 4, etc... And they are usually played and danced in the same ascending order as listed here. *MAIN KARSILAMA GAMES **MALE KARSILAMALAR ***1- FIRST KARSILAMA ***2- SECOND KARSILAMA ***3- THIRD KARSILAMA ***4- Fourth KARSILAMA **FEMALE KARSILAMALAR ***1- FIRST KARSILAMA ***2- SECOND KARSILAMA ***3- THIRD KARSILAMA ***4- Fourth KARSILAMA ===Syrtos=== Syrtos: Sirtos are one of the most liked folk dances and music in Cyprus. Syrtos comes from the Greek word \\"œÉœçœÅœâ\\" (drag). However, it is easy to also observe the Turkish motives in the ones used in Cyprus. Even Ottoman Sultans liked very much this Greek music form and composed songs in that form. The most popular non-anonymous example is the Hicaz Sirto of 32nd Ottoman Sultan Abdul Aziz, which is known in North Cyprus among Turkish Cypriots as Aziziye Sirto. Similarly it is known (played and danced) in the South Cyprus among Greek Cypriots as Aziziyes Syrtos. This is quite normal taking into consideration that the two communities lived together for a very long time in Cyprus history. In some parts of sirtos pairs of dancers hold a handkerchief from its two sides as in karsilamas. When one of the dancers starts making skillful movements the other stops dancing and keeps holding the handkerchief firmly so that his friend will not fall down. Œúost popular syrtos: Cyprus and Turkey *Male and female Sirto‚Äôs **1- Nisiotikos (Greek island dances) **2- Politiko Syrto **3- Koftos, Azizies, Karagozlu, Seherli and Bafra **4- Pomasko Sirto (with roots of Kalamatianos dance) **6- Cretan sirtos **5- Azize and Iskele **6- Hortarakia (œáŒøœÅœÑŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±) **7- Kƒ±na Sirtosu,Feslikan,Dillirga **8- Xekina Mia Psaropoula ===Kalamatianos=== Kalamatianos: Kalamatianos Or Kalamatian√≥ dance, with the same roots of syrtos is a popular Greek folkdance throughout Greece, Cyprus and internationally, performed at many social gatherings worldwide. This form of dance is familiar in Turkey, too. The steps of the Kalamatian√≥s are the same as those of the Syrtos dance, but the latter is slower and more stately, its beat being an even 4/4. The lead dancer usually holds the second dancer by a handkerchief. Like the other circle dances, the steps are 12: 10 steps counterclockwise (\\"forward\\") followed by 2 steps clockwise (\\"backwards\\"). Depe nding on the occasion and the dancers' proficiency, certain steps may be taken as jumps or squats. ===Zeibekiko=== Zeibekiko: Zeibekiko or Zeybekiko () is a Turkic folk dance with a rhythmic pattern of 9/4Kilpatrick, David. \\"Ethnomusicology\\", Vol. 6, No. 3, Canadian Issue (Sep., 1972), p. 577. or else 9/8 (broken down as 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8). Greek Cypriots and Rhodos Greeks, call it \\"Zeybekikos\\". It is very popular in Western and Central Anatolia. It is danced by one person only and is of free choreographic structure. In older times if another got up, it would be a cause for conflict and possible violence. However, in the 21st century a certain dance etiquette has evolved, so that other men wait to take turn after and if the dancer stops. Traditionally, applause was not sought nor commonly given, out of respect. This did not, however, lessen creativity, with dancers performing feats such as standing on a glass of wine or a chair or fireplace, or picking up a table, adding a sense of little braggadocio and humor. It is believed that the name of the dance derives from Greeks who immigrated to Asia Minor from Thrace. These immigrants, called zeibekfli or zeibektdes. ===Nisiotika=== Nisiotika: Nisiotika is the name of the dances of Greek islands. It is a form of folk music including, all the above dances of Greek antiqity: Syrtos, Kalamatianos, Sousta, Pentozali, Ikariotikos and other, very widespread in the area. ===Tsifteteli and Arabiye=== Tsifteteli: This dance is free form dance which include males and females in stage with a careographi Arabiye: Ciftetellis and Arabiyes are free dance forms danced by females. Female dancers swing their heads, shake their shoulders and chests, swing their bellies and hips, etc. mostly to attract males. Some examples are, Bahriye Ciftetellisi, Mevlana, Arabiye 1, Arabiye 2, etc... ===Topical dances=== Topical Dances: These are the dramatic dances with some themes from daily life or special events. They can be categorized into 5 groups according to their themes: animal motions and behaviors, daily and special human activities, male-female relations, nature facts and events, fights and battles with or without guns. Music of many of these dances contain lyrics. The significance of these lyrics is to strengthen the effect of the movements in the dances. These dances enable skillful dancers to illustrate interesting aspects of the corresponding themes. Orak, Kozan, Kartal, Topal, Degirmenci, Nisan, etc., are the most popular examples in this category. Examples of topical dances: Orak Orak: Orak means sickle in Turkish. This dance is about harvesting time. Farmer men use their sickles to harvest. Their women also help them. The women give water (in jugs) to thirsty and tired men. Some of the men, when they become vigorous or when they want to show off, start to show their expertise in using their sickles. They throw up and catch their sickles repeatedly, use two sickles simultaneously for harvesting, etc... Kozan Kozan (dance): This is danced with a water jug in \\"henna nights\\" (a part of wedding ceremonies), after the bride's hand has been put henna. At the end of this dance which is danced by only females, the bride breaks the jug by throwing it to the ground. The broken jug symbolizes an everlasting happiness. Another belief is that the pieces of this broken jug (and the coins and sweets put a-priori inside the jug) which spread on the ground when the jug is broken symbolize fertility. Kartal Kartal (dance): Kartal means eagle in Turkish. This dance is about the struggle of an eagle not to let his prey be seized by other eagles. Topal Topal: Topal means lamed in Turkish. This dance is about the struggle of a lamed bridegroom candidate with his \\"would be\\" father-in-law who does not like him as a husband for his daughter even though he is also lamed. Degirmenci Degirmenci :The copy woman showing her beauty in order to get her wheat grinded without many. The woman offers her hair,lips,ice,to the grinder but the refuses her. Bicak Oyunu Bicak Oyunu: Copy‚Äôs an animal being cut and hung. It is played by 1 people. Koroglu Koroglu : Copy is a blind man which is known as his brave.

The result was an opposition victory, with the Free National Movement, led by former Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, claiming 23 of the 41 seats. Incumbent Prime Minister Perry Christie conceded defeat in a phone call to his rival.Bahamas government ousted in poll, BBC News, 3 May 2007. Ingraham was sworn into the office of Prime Minister on 4 May.Swearing in the Rt. Hon. Hubert Alexander Ingraham Bahamas Government, 4 May 2007 == Background == The Bahamas is dominated by two parties: the left of center Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), and the right of center Free National Movement (FNM). The Free National Movement party came to power in the 1992 election, under the leadership of Hubert Ingraham. After winning the 1997 election and having now served 10 years as prime minister, Ingraham announced that he would step down from the FNM before the start of the 2002 election. Tommy Turnquest then took over the party leadership of the FNM, and many voters, including FNM supporters, felt that Turnquest was much \\"weaker\\" than the leader of the Progressive Liberal Party, Perry Christie. The 2002 election saw a PLP victory with Perry Christie becoming prime minister. After their victory, the PLP focussed and worked on improving and attracting foreign investments for the islands as well as further growing the all important tourism sector within the Bahamas. Many were confident that a PLP victory in 2007 was possible as the GDP had grown 4% since they took control of the government in 2002. During the FNM party's November 2005 convention, Hubert Ingraham was elected leader of the party after he had expressed that he would like to return to the party ahead of the 2007 election. Back under the strong leadership of Ingraham, the FNM party became energised when scandal emerged within the PLP. American celebrity Anna- Nicole Smith was photographed in an embrace with Immigration Minister, Shane Gibson of the PLP. Before photos emerged of the two together, many Bahamians were alarmed when Smith filed for legal residency in the Bahamas in August 2006 and was granted residency just a month later, even though the process sometimes takes years. Allegations also emerged that Gibson had received money and gifts from Smith as well. Shane Gibson finally resigned in February 2007 after the photos of him and Smith were published in a local newspaper. Reuters in March 2007 reported: \\"Opposition leaders charged that the government's handling of Smith's case shows its incompetence, and two political commentators said the race had tightened. 'The Anna Nicole debacle and all the publicity regarding that ... has energized the base of the (Free National Movement) and hurt the PLP. They are losing ground and something needs to happen to swing the momentum back,‚Äô said an attorney close to the opposition. [...] D'Andre Wright, 18, a first-time voter, said the Smith story was simply a distraction. 'That is fine and dandy but we need to focus on what the FNM can do better than the government,‚Äô she said\\". == Opinion polls == Many Bahamian voters wanted a more transparent government from the 2007 election, because the economy in 2007 was \\"anaemic\\", they viewed the previous administration as unproductive, and there was a rising crime rate. Ingraham was voted over Christie because people wanted change. Although they wanted a lot out of this election, it was not promising as people felt that politics were dominated by an \\"exclusive clique\\" due to the candidates Christie and Ingraham being good friends and business partners. The rumours of election fraud also did not appeal to voters and lowered their opinions on both the election as a whole and the candidates, as they did not respond well to the scandals. Many people believed that the PLP did have a clear plan, and that they did a poor job with public relations. Some thought that House of Assembly did not listen to their constituents, and that the PLP did not focus enough on the common man. They were indecisive and \\"reluctant to act on critical issues\\". Many people did not like that their land policy favoured white foreigners. However, others believed the PLP was attempting to establish a \\"true and sustained democracy\\", a characteristic that the party had prided itself on since the beginning. Although mainly faults of the PLP have been listed and many people were not surprised nor disappointed by their loss, many also thought the election was a complete toss up with no clear predicted winner. In general, Bahamian voters favoured Ingraham over Christie. Females did not favour him as much as males, however, as he won the female vote by a smaller margin than the male. == Results == ==Aftermath== The controversial victory of Hubert Ingraham, member of the Free National Movement, incited strong reactions, particularly from the Progressive Liberal Party. The PLP announced it questioned the validity of (and may request a recount of) the electoral votes in districts where the results were closer. Despite a delayed report on the results of the election and the scepticism coming from the PLP, Perry Christie called Hubert Ingraham to concede two and a half hours after the results were reported. However, after the concession of the PLP, rumours of the FNM's victory being overturned. Prime Minister Ingraham countered claims of miscounts by accusing the PLP of corruption mentioning that there had not been this level of corruption in any recent general election. In response to the 49.86% of votes being cast for the FNM, Perry Christie, leader of the PLP said \\"Ingraham must now live with the reality that he is the first ever prime minister of a government elected with a minority of the popular vote.‚Äù On 7 May, Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham appointed the following Cabinet Ministers: * Hubert Ingraham, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance * Brent Symonette, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. * Tommy Turnquest, Minister of National Security. * Claire Hepburn, appointed to the Senate and made Attorney General. * Carl Bethel, Minister of Education, Youth, Sports and Culture. * Kenneth Russell, Minister of Housing and National Insurance. * Earl Deveaux, Minister of Works and Transport. * Neko Grant, Minister of Tourism and Aviation. * Dion Foulkes, appointed to the Senate and made Minister of Maritime Affairs and Labour. * Lawrence (Larry) Cartwright, Minister of Agriculture and Marine Resources. * Sidney Collie, Minister of Lands and Local Government. * Dr. Hubert Minnis, Minister of Health and Social Development. * Zhivargo Laing, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance. * Desmond Bannister, Minister of State in the Ministry of Legal Affairs. * Elma Campbell, appointed to the Senate and made Minister of State for Immigration in the Ministry of National Security. * Loretta Butler-Turner, Minister of State for Social Services. * Byron Woodside, Minister of State for Youth & Sports. * Charles Maynard, Minister of State for Youth & Culture. * Branville McCartney, Minister of State in the Ministry of Tourism & Aviation. * Phenton Neymour, Minister State for Public Utilities. Controversy surrounded the appointment of Brent Symonette as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, as Perry Christie critiqued him for being a white and wealthy Bahamian. Ingraham responded to this critique by saying: \\"If we are to become all that we might be we must aspire to transcend historic prejudices and break loose from the stereotypical bounds of the politics of race and class division that belongs to a bygone era. That is behind us and we must leave it so that we can achieve full unity in our land with a government dedicated to serving all Bahamians, black and white, middle class, rich and poor; young and old able and disabled\\". == References == Bahamas General election Category:Elections in the Bahamas Category:May 2007 events in North America ","title":"2007 Bahamian general election"},{"id":"9142207","text":"Jeu des petits chevaux is a French cross and circle game, closely related to ludo.

He is from Batak ethnic group. After completing his education, Panggabean took on work as a teacher, an occupation held in high regard in the Batak community, and even became the principal of a school in Tarutung. In 1942, with the arrival and subsequent occupation of Indonesia by the Japanese Imperial Army, Panggabean left the field of education. He first trained to become a civil servant under the Japanese Occupational Government although he would soon be interested in taking on a military career. ==Military career== In 1943, the Japanese Occupation Government formed the Defenders of the Fatherland Army an auxiliary force consisting of Indonesians which were designed to assist the Japanese should the Allies come to invade Indonesia. Like many of his military contemporaries, Panggabean joined. In Panggabean's case however, he seemed to have only manage to go through military schooling and basic training before the Japanese surrendered and nationalist leaders Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed Indonesia's independence. Like all other youths all around Indonesia, Panggabean was caught up in the rush to take weapons from the Japanese in preparation of the formation of a National Army. On 5 October 1945, the People's Security Army, the precursor to the Indonesian National Armed Forces and later on, TNI was formed. Panggabean took up the position of military trainer at Sibolga before serving as Chief of Staff for the 1st Battalion, 4th Regiment, 10th Division in Sumatra until 1949. Following the Indonesian National Revolution of 1945‚Äì1950, Panggabean spent the next 10 years as a regimental chief of staff at Tapanuli and as a sectoral commander in the Military Territory of North Sumatra. In 1957, Panggabean also took the opportunity for further military education at the Infantry Officers Advanced Course in the United States. In 1959, Panggabean became battalion commander before being transferred to Military Territory II/Sriwijaya as resort commander. Panggabean then received his first assignment out of Sumatra as a military court judge in Makassar, Sulawesi. As the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation intensified, Panggabean was appointed commander of the 2nd War Theater, with authority over the troops in Borneo. There, he developed a friendship with Suharto [Indonesia-News] JKTP - Maraden Panggabean Dies at 78 as the then Kostrad commander had troops stationed in Borneo. After he cracked down on the 30 September Movement, Suharto became the Commander of the Army. Suharto seemed to have remembered Panggabean and appointed him as a staff member with the position of second deputy. ==Supersemar controversy== Although originally not part of the events which led to the formulation of Supersemar and Suharto receiving executive power, Panggabean became part of the controversy in 1998. According to Sukardjo Wilardjito, a presidential bodyguard stationed at Bogor, Panggabean was present with Amirmachmud, M Jusuf, and Basuki Rahmat, the three generals that many accounts agree to have been present when Supersemar was signed. According to Sukardjo, Panggabean, alongside Basuki held Sukarno at gunpoint while he signed a pre-prepared Supersemar.Indonews archives - August 1998, week 4 (#652) ==New OrderMilitary career during New Order=== In July 1966, the position of Deputy Army Commander was created and Panggabean was appointed to the position to assist Suharto with his increasing workload. In 1967, Panggabean became Army Commander himself. As Army Commander, Panggabean witnessed a reorganization in the Indonesian National Armed Forces which saw the armed services commanders be reduced in status to chief of staffs under the control of an Army commander, a position to be filled by Suharto himself. In 1969, Panggabean became the Commander of Kopkamtib. Two years later, in 1971, Suharto reshuffled the Cabinet and Panggabean became Deputy Commander in addition to becoming State Minister assisting the President in matters of Defense and Security . Panggabean reached the pinnacle of his military career in 1973 when he became Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces in addition to becoming Minister of Defense and Security. As Commander, Panggabean had differences with Minister of Foreign Affairs Adam Malik in the way in which Indonesia should approach its foreign policy in South East Asia. Malik wanted ASEAN to only be about economic cooperation whilst Panggabean wanted ASEAN to also be about security cooperation. In addition, Panggabean also wanted to send troops to assist the South Vietnamese in the Vietnam War. On this matter, Suharto sided with Malik. In April 1978, Panggabean was discharged as Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces and Minister of Defense and Security. ===Golkar=== In addition to continuing his military career, Panggabean also began a political career by being involved in Golkar, the political party which Suharto had chosen as part of his re-election bid. In 1973, Panggabean became a member of the Golkar Executive Board before becoming Chairman of the Executive Board in 1974. He served in this position until 1978 when Suharto replaced him in the position. Nevertheless, Panggabean was retained as vice chairman of the executive board and served as the day-to-day chairman until 1988. ===Government official=== After being discharged as commander, Panggabean was named by Suharto as Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. He served as Minister until 1983 when he was appointed Chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council. When his term ended in 1988, Panggabean retired from politics. ===Other activities=== In 1985, Panggabean became Advisory Chairman for the Joint Organization of Batak Tradition and Culture. In 1989, he became a Patron of the Bona Pasogit Foundation, an organization dealing with rehabilitation of earthquake affected areas in Panggabean's native Tarutung. ==Death== Panggabean in Jakarta on 22 May 2000 after suffering from stroke. ==Miscellaneous== Panggabean was married to Meida Seimima Tambunan with whom he had four children.

According to the National Commission of the Organization of the Elections (CONEL), 1,807 candidates stood in the first round for 137 seats in the National Assembly.\\"Congo: ouverture de la campagne du premier tour des √©lections l√©gislatives\\", AFP, 8 June 2007 .

In this letter, Lekoundzou and Thyst√®re Tchicaya urged the establishment of an independent national electoral commission to oversee the 2007 parliamentary elections.\\"L√©gislatives 2007.

Coming from two leading members of the Presidential Majority, the letter was a significant gesture of dissent, as it called into question the government's existing efforts to establish an independent electoral commission. In response to the letter, the deputies of the Presidential Majority, led by Alexandre Denguet Atiki, held a meeting in Mpila on 11 April 2007 to clarify that they did not endorse the letter. They criticized Lekoundzou and Thyst√®re Tchicaya for acting outside of the parliamentary process and for making a statement that could be misinterpreted as reflecting the broader wishes of the deputies of the Presidential Majority, given their leadership roles.\\"Les d√©put√©s de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle d√©sapprouvent la proposition de Jean Pierre Thystere- Tchicaya et Justin Itihi-Ossetoumba Lekoundzou\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 11 April 2007 . In April 2007, the National Assembly approved a bill providing for the creation of an independent electoral commission, but it was not signed into law by Sassou Nguesso in time for the election; as a result, the election was conducted according to older legislation. The opposition criticized this, but it also criticized the bill passed in April on the grounds that the powers of the proposed electoral commission would be too limited.\\"Un collectif de partis d‚Äôopposition appelle au boycott des √©lections l√©gislatives\\", AFP, 27 May 2007 . ==Campaign== On 23 April 2007, 42 groups of the presidential majority, supporting President Sassou Nguesso, signed an electoral agreement in Brazzaville providing for a common electoral strategy. Parties signing this agreement included Sassou Nguesso's party, the Congolese Labor Party (PCT), as well as Club 2002-Party for the Unity of the Republic, led by Wilfrid Nguesso, the Dynamic for Democracy and Social Progress (DDPS), led by Marcel Mbani, the Union for the Defense of Democracy (UDD), led by Pierre Damien Boussoukou- Boumba, the Republican Pole of Renovators (PRR), and the Party for the Safeguarding of Republican Values (PSVR), led by Michel Mampouya.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"42 formations politiques de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle signent un accord √©lectoral\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, April 24, 2007 . The PCT and the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI) of Bernard Kol√©las signed an agreement on 24 April to form an alliance for the parliamentary election as well as subsequent local, senatorial, and presidential elections. This marked the official renewal of a previous alliance between the two parties in the early 1990s, which had lapsed later in the decade. A joint technical committee was to oversee the implementation of the agreement.\\"Republic of Congo's parties in political alliance\\", Xinhua, April 26, 2007.Willy Mbossa & Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le MCDDI et le PCT de nouveau alli√©s pour gouverner ensemble\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, April 24, 2007 .

Despite signing an agreement with the government in late April 2007, the National Council of Republicans (CNR), the party of former rebel leader Pasteur Ntumi, later announced that it would not participate in the election due to what it described as a lack of transparency. On June 7, Ntumi said that his party would participate, but on June 19 the CNR demanded that the government delay the election within two days or the party would boycott. It alleged that the organization of the election was not transparent and said that electoral rolls had not yet been posted and that voter cards had not yet been distributed.\\"L√©gislatives au Congo: l'ex-rebelle Ntumi menace √† nouveau de se retirer\\", AFP, June 19, 2007 . Ultimately the CNR participated in the election, putting forward six candidates, including Ntumi. The end of hostilities with Ntumi's \\"Ninja\\" rebels enabled the 2007 election to be held fully in the Pool Region; in the previous parliamentary election in 2002, voting did not take place in the eight of the 14 constituencies in the Pool Region due to the activities of Ntumi's rebel group.\\"Congo would-be MPs barred\\", BBC News, May 28, 2002.

Although many voters did not receive their voter cards, Armand Baboutila, the Director-General of Electoral Affairs, assured them on June 20 that their voter cards would be available at the polling stations on election day. ==Conduct== In the first round of the election, held on 24 June, serious problems were reported, including the absence of electoral rolls and voter cards, or errors in them, in some places.John James, \\"Counting begins in Congo election\\", BBC News, June 25, 2007.\\"Congo: premier tour des l√©gislatives chaotique\\", AFP, June 25, 2007 . Widespread delays were reported in the opening of polling stations, and turnout was said to be low. The electoral commission said that results would not be available for a week or more. The opposition denounced the election, with Ambroise Herv√© Malonga, acting as spokesman for the boycotting opposition parties, calling it \\"chaos, not an election\\". The President of CONEL, Henri Bouka, acknowledged problems, but said that they were limited to Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, the country's two main cities.\\"L√©gislatives chaotiques au Congo: l'opposition confort√©e dans ses craintes\\", AFP, June 25, 2007 . The observer missions of the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States said in a joint statement on June 26 that, among other shortcomings, polling stations were opened late, electoral materials were often unavailable, voters were often not included on the voter rolls, and many voters did not receive voter registration cards. They also judged voter turnout to be very low. On the other hand, they said that voting was peaceful and without intimidation.\\"L√©gislatives : les observateurs de l'UA et de la CEEAC rel√®vent des manquements\\", Xinhua (Jeuneafrique.com), June 26, 2007 .

Gaston Ololo was appointed in Baboutila's place for the second round. Opposition spokesman Malonga demanded on June 29 that the election be annulled and that the government, and particularly Ibovi, resign. Malonga said that the suspension of Baboutila was insufficient and that Ibovi and the President of CONEL, Henri Bouka, should have resigned. Roger Bouka of the Congolese Observatory of Human Rights was also sharply critical of irregularities and the failure of voting to take place in some areas, calling for the election to be annulled. A report by African Union observers said that there were major problems in the second round; among other things, it cited voter list errors, with some names absent and others listed more than once, and \\"incomplete distribution of the new voter registration cards\\".

Malonga said that the second round was poorly organized. According to results announced by Ibovi on August 9, the PCT won a total of 44 seats, while its allies won a total of 80 seats, including the MCDDI with 12 seats. Opposition parties won a total of 11 seats, 10 for UPADS and one for the UDR.

Tsaty-Mabiala was chosen as President of the UPADS Parliamentary Group, which was the only opposition parliamentary group. Also in September, 12 elected deputies notified the National Assembly that they would not sit as deputies due to the incompatibility of that position with another position they already held, and would therefore be replaced by their substitutes. These 12 deputies included two presidential advisers (Laurent Tengo and Thierry Moungala) and ten ministers in the government (Lamyr Nguel√©, Emile Mabondzo, Pierre-Michel Nguimbi, Henri Ossebi, Jean-Claude Gakosso, Andr√© Okombi Salissa, Martin Parfait Aim√© Coussoud-Mavoungou, Jean-Baptiste Tati-Loutard, Bruno Itoua, and Jeanne Dambendzet).\\"Les bureaux des commissions permanentes ont √©t√© enfin √©lus\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,729, 21 September 2007 .

Incumbent President Joseph Urusemal, was defeated for re-election by challenger Manny Mori at the opening session of the newly elected 15th Congress of Micronesia. The Congress also elected Alik L. Alik to serve as the new Vice-President. Flag of the Federated States of Micronesia == Background == Micronesia is an electoral democracy and has a population of about 550,000 people, not including the Marshall Islands. Micronesia is made up of 607 islands that are grouped into four individual states. Because there are only four states, each state has its own constitution, elected legislature, and governor. State governments in Micronesia have a great deal of power, especially in budgetary matters. Traditional leaders and institutions also hold significant influence in society, especially at the village level. The Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the 1979 constitution, which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators‚Äîone from each state‚Äîserve four- year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are then elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections. The president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties. == Candidates == The candidate list for the 2007 Presidential election was as follows: Resio Moses of Pohnpei State, Manny Mori of Chuuk State, Alik Alik of Kosrae State and Joseph Urusemal of Yap State who was the sitting President. Essentially, the election held one representative from each state. In this election however, many of the candidates were running conditionally in terms of which position (President or Vice President) they win. Resio Moses was not interested in the President or Vice President positions while Manny Mori publicly stated that he is only interested in the Presidency and would not accept the lesser Vice President position under any circumstance. Alik Alik would have accepted the Vice Presidency but only if Joseph Urusemal was re- elected as President for a second term. Resio Moses was one of the founding fathers of the Federated States of Micronesia and was the first Governor of the state of Pohnpei. He later became the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs. He also became Micronesia's Ambassador in the United Nations where he was a key player in the establishment of diplomatic and relations with multiple countries and global organizations. Moses became a member of the 10th Micronesian Congress in 1997 and has been a member ever since. He had held multiple other positions over the years, including Chairman, vice chairman, and member of a number of Congressional Committees prior to his running for the Presidency. Manny Mori received an Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Management from the University of Guam and spent a year working for the Guam Citicorp Credit Union. Shortly after, he became the Assistant Manager for the Saipan Branch of Citicorp Credit Union and a few years later moved on to be the Assistant Administrator for the Trust Territory Social Security Administration. When Micronesia became a sovereign state in 1979, Mori became the first National Revenue Officer for the State of Chuuk. After two years of working for the Chuuk State Government, Mori was hired as the comptroller of the Micronesia Development Bank. Three years after joining the bank, Mori was promoted President and Chief Executive Officer of the Development Bank. In 1997, Six years later, Mori moved to the Bank of the Federated States. Mori became involved in politics in 1999 when he became Chuuk's representative to the 11th FSM Congress where he held two positions; Vice Chairmanship on the committee of Judiciary and Governmental Operations (J&GO;) and the committee on Health Education and Social Affairs (HESA). Three years later, Mori took on the Chairmanship of the committee on Ways and Means while still maintaining his membership on the committees mentioned above. In 2003, Mori took a break from politics and became the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer for the Chuuk Public Utilities Corporation. Under his management, the Corporation successfully executed progressive reform measures that include the restoration of 24-hour electricity to Weno, the capital island of Chuuk State. The next year, Mori re-entered the field of politics as Chuuk's four year representative to the Micronesian Congress. In that Congress, he served as the Vice Chairman of the Committee on External Affairs and held membership in a handful of other committees. Alik L. Alik had been involved in government and politics since the start of his career by interning for the Government of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) within the Department of Education. Shortly after his time with the government, he went on to University of Hawaii Law School ‚Äì Paralegal Program. Upon completing the two- year program in 1984, he was immediately hired by the FSM Supreme Court to be a law clerk. In the Department of External Affairs hired him as a Foreign Service Officer and was soon promoted to Deputy Chief in the Division of South Pacific Affairs. In 1989 he became Micronesia's first ambassador to Fiji and to most of the island nations within the south Pacific and held the post for the next nine years. As the ambassador to Fiji, Alik was also associated to Israel, Tonga, Nauru, Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. In 1992, he earned the title Dean of the Diplomatic Corp of Fiji. In 1998 Alik was again appointed to represent the nation, as Micronesia's Ambassador to Japan. He again was associated with various nations in Asia, specifically; China, South Korea, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. In 2003, Senator Alik joined electoral politics and won the State of Kosrae Congressional seat and was also elected to be the chairman of the committee on Resource and Development. He was also a member of the committees of Judiciary & Governmental Operations and External Affairs. Senator Alik also held the chairmanship for the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs. Joseph Urusemal received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Administration of Justice in 1976 and went to work for the Jackson County Department of Correction. He worked for the government of Jackson County for about six years until he returned to Micronesia in 1982. Upon his arrival to Micronesia, he worked with the State Department of Education as a teacher and counselor at the Outer Islands High School. During his tenure, he served on the Education Steering Committee where he was a key player in establishing Yap's State Education Five Year Plan. Urusemal was elected as Yap State's representative to the Fifth Congress of Micronesia. He also held membership on the following committees; Health Education and Social Affairs; Resources and Development; and External Affairs. Urusemal held his seat in the next Congress until he was selected to be the Floor Leader of the Seventh Micronesian Congress. He was also a member on the following Standing Committees; Health, Education, and Social Affairs; Resources and Development; Transportation and Communication; and Judiciary and Governmental Operations. During the next five congresses, Urusemal held his role as Floor Leader of the Congress and his membership on the same four Standing Committees. Joseph Urusemal was the Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Compact Economic Negotiations and was the Chairman of the Working Group. During his tenure in Congress, Urusemal also served as the Secretary General for the National Group to the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians' Union. On May 11, 2003, Joseph J. Urusemal was seated as the Sixth President of Micronesia. == Election Result == 117,977 people were registered to vote in the congressional election however, only 39,067 votes were cast. Despite the exceptionally low turnout, Freedom House claims that it hardly affects the results of the congressional election, which directly affects the Presidential election, due to Micronesia's high freedom rating. Micronesia is ranked as a 1 on Freedom Houses scale of 1 being most free and 7 being the least. They are also ranked 1 in terms of civil liberties and political rights. Manny Mori won the Presidency while Alik L. Alik won the Vice Presidency. There are no public records in regards to the vote distribution however, Jack Corbett of the University of Southampton speculates that Mori won the Presidency due to his experience in business. It is for the same reason that Alik was elected Vice President, because he has a great deal of international experience. Being a small nation, Micronesia has a great desire to be more involved with the global marketplace and wanted a leader with experience in that area to drive them forward. Mori also gained a lot of popularity because it was the first time that his state, Chuuk which consists of 16 islands, approached the election with a unified delegation and support for Mori. ==References== ==External links== *Chuuk's Manny Mori New FSM President Category:Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia Category:2007 elections in Oceania ","title":"2007 Micronesian presidential election"},{"id":"9142284","text":"Sir John Morphett, c. 1834 John Morphett, c. 1866 Sir John Morphett, c. 1880 Gravestone in West Terrace Cemetery. Sir John Morphett (4 May 1809 - 7 November 1892) was a South Australian pioneer, landowner and politician. His younger brother George Morphett was also an early setter in South Australia. ==Early life== Morphett was born in London, the second son of Nathaniel Morphett, a solicitor, and his wife Mary, n√©e Gliddon, of Cummins, Ide, Devon. When very young he was sent to a boarding school with Mme Pasquier in Wandsworth, and then to Webber's school in Teignmouth, Devon with his younger brother George. At 14 he went to the Manor House Academy, a school run by the mathematics writer Daniel Dowling at the top of Highgate Hill, London. It offered \\"a broad liberal education, with social accomplishments and a choice of vocational and scientific courses\\". He walked three miles there and back from Camden Town. At 16 he started as an office boy in the employ of a ship broker, Henry Blanshard. He then obtained a position in the counting house of Wilson & Blanshard. At 21 he left for Egypt and worked in the counting-house of Harris & Co in Alexandria. It was here that he met Colonel William Light. He returned to London in 1834, became interested in the South Australian colonisation schemes, and was an early investor in the South Australian Company; he was one of the first who paid ¬£81 for a preliminary land order of 134 acres.John Morphett, www.southaustralianhistory.com.au With his younger brother George, he set up an agency business and published a pamphlet declaring his intention of migrating to South Australia and his readiness to act for purchasers of land. He also advertised in similar terms in the Globe and Traveller, 30 July 1835.'Morphett, Sir John (1809‚Äì1892)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 2, Melbourne University Press, 1967, pp 261‚Äì262. Retrieved 2009-10-17 In September 1834 he joined the South Australian Literary Association, and around the end of 1835 he attended the dinner given to honour Captain Hindmarsh's appointment as governor of South Australia. ==Arrival in South Australia== On 20 March 1836, Morphett sailed for South Australia in the Cygnet, which arrived at Kangaroo Island on 11 September 1836. On 5 November 1836, the Cygnet arrived at Holdfast Bay. Next day, with Lieutenant Field and George Strickland Kingston, he explored the River Torrens. With others on the Cygnet, he also identified the mouth of the Port River, identified the suitability of Port Adelaide, and visited Port Lincoln with Light. At the crucial meeting on 10 February 1837, he played a decisive role in confirming the choice of Adelaide for a settlement. On 15 August 1838 he married Elizabeth Hurtle Fisher, the eldest daughter of James Hurtle Fisher (later Sir James), whom he had first met at the meetings of the South Australian Literary Association in London. They were married at Trinity Church, South Australia's first Anglican Church. As a land agent for the South Australian Company, he secured valuable land for his family and clients; he was energetic, enthusiastic sensible and lucky, and profited greatly from a multitude of land transactions. A Secondary Towns Association was formed in England in 1838, and Morphett became the local Colonial Representative for that Association. In this capacity he often engaged the services of John Hill in exploring for survey sites, while also exploring himself. In May 1839 he paid ¬£4,000 for a Special Survey of of land along the Hutt River, and in November 1939 he bought 8,000 acres on the River Murray which became the Wood's Point Estate. During November 1841, as one of the trustees for Lt. Col. George Gawler, Morphett selected land in sections 1553 and 1554 to the south of the Barossa South Survey. In December 1839, Morphett was elected Director of the South Australian Railway Company. In 1842, he became one of four members appointed by the Crown to assist the Governor, and was also elected Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Morphett was one of the originators of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, presiding over the introductory meeting on 24 April 1844. In April 1846, he became a member of the Committee of management of the English Railway Company which proposed to lay a railway along Port Road. He was a director of the Adelaide Mining Company, and also a director of the South Australian Mining Association which owned the Burra mine. When the Adelaide Cricket Club was formed in 1853, Morphett became its vice-president and his father-in-law, J.H. Fisher, its president.Information about \\"Cummins\\" and its first owner, West Torrens Historical Society, wtcc.sa.gov.au ==Political life== Morphett was appointed treasurer to the town corporation on 5 December 1840, and on 15 June 1843 was nominated as one of four non-official members of the expanded South Australian Legislative Council. In January 1845 he chaired the meeting called to protest the British government's proposal to send Parkhurst prison boys to South Australia. In September 1846, as a protest against the mining royalty bill being passed by the casting vote of Governor Robe, Morphett and the three other non-official council members left the chamber ‚Äì in consequence the council was left without a quorum. In August 1851 Morphett became Speaker of the enlarged Legislative Council, and on 9 March 1857 he was elected a member of the legislative council at the first election under responsible government. He was chief secretary in the Thomas Reynolds ministry from February to October 1861, and on 31 March 1865 was elected President of the South Australian Legislative Council, a position he held until his retirement. He was knighted on 16 February 1870 for his services to South Australia. In February 1873 he retired from politics and public life. His sons Hurtle and John Cummins took over the running of his properties along the Murray. ==Personal life== Freemasonry filled a great part of Morphett's personal life. He was elected as a member and initiated into the Craft on 27 November 1834 in London when The Lodge of Friendship, a Lodge especially founded to become South Australia's first Lodge, held its very first meeting. Later he rose in position within the Lodge, (which is still in operation), ultimately to become its Master. He returned to England twice: alone in 1846, leaving Mrs. Morphett at home with four daughters and a son; then in December 1855 with his wife, ten children and two servants.Perry, Dulcie. Sir John Morphett : a South Australian colonist of distinction Cummins Society, Nover Gardens South Australia, 1992. ==Death== Morphett died at his home, Cummins House, Novar Gardens, on 7 November 1892. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth, six daughters and four of his five sons. ==Legacy== Morphett had faith in the colony from the beginning: although he realized that for a period South Australia would be regarded as a pastoral colony, depending chiefly on its export of wool, as early as 1838 he had hopes of raising wine, olive oil, figs, maize, flax, silk, rice, indigo and tobacco.J. Stephens, The Land of Promise, p. 49 Morphett supported Fisher and Gouger in their quarrels with Hindmarsh, later becoming a force in the Legislative Council, and he worked hard for responsible government. He took an active part in the formation of the Literary Association and the Mechanics Institute, and was an early supporter of St Peter's College. He was one of the earliest men to take an interest in horse racing in South Australia, and Morphettville Racecourse was named after him. Also named after him were the suburbs of Morphettville and Morphett Vale, Morphett Street in the Adelaide city centre, Morphett Road in the city's western suburbs and the state electoral district of Morphett. ==FamilyParents=== John was born on 4 May 1809 in London, England, the second son of Nathaniel and Mary, n√©e Gliddon.Reece Jennings, John and George Morphett, West Torrens Historical Society ===Siblings=== His siblings included: *George Morphett (1811‚Äì1893). *Nathaniel Morphett (1807‚Äì1828) *Mary Morphett (1813‚Äì1830) ===Children=== John Morphett (1809‚Äì1892) married Elizabeth Hurtle Fisher (1815‚Äì1905) on 15 August 1838 at Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide.

In 1969, Lyndon Green replaced Strevens and within a year, they were joined by the American singer and flautist, Ann Steuart. This new line up of Tudor Lodge, Stannard, Green and Ann Stuart successfully gigged the south east English folk circuit for the next two years, playing at numerous venues, including the Troubadour and Les Cousins clubs in London. This scene included artists including Ralph McTell, Al Stewart, Mike Cooper and John Martyn.

A six-week tour of the Netherlands had been scheduled for January and February 1972 and Linda Peters replaced Steuart. On their return, Peters left to pursue a musical career with Richard Thompson. Her departure signalled a temporary end to Tudor Lodge. In the spring of 1972, Lyndon Green travelled to Berlin with Mike Silver, where he spent the next year playing gigs and recording album tracks with Silver as well as with the American John Vaughan. In 1981 Steuart, Green and Stannard got together to play a reunion show and Stannard and Green decided to resurrect Tudor Lodge, recruiting Lynne Whiteland. In 1988, Green moved to Japan and Stannard and Whiteland starting playing and recording as a duo. In 1999, Tudor Lodge played two gigs in Tokyo, where Whiteland and Stannard were joined on stage by Green and Japanese musicians Bice (keyboard and vocals) and Shimizu Hirotaka (bass). Tudor Lodge then continued to play at folk clubs and festivals in the South of England.

According to Ekindi, this represented discrimination against small parties and was illegal.Propagande: Des acteurs pas sur la fr√©quence La Nouvelle Expression, 20 July 2007 On 18 July 2007, the MP formalized an alliance with the Cameroonian Democratic Union (UDC); as part of this agreement, the parties decided not to run candidates in the same constituencies.Coalition: UDC et le MP font le travail en commun Mutations, 19 July 2007 ==Conduct== On 17 July, John Fru Ndi, the leader of the opposition SDF, which suffered from divisions in the years preceding the election, claimed that the preparations for the elections were plagued with irregularities, including poor distribution of voter registration cards (with some people receiving multiple cards and others receiving no cards) and the redrawing of electoral districts even though census results had not been published. Fru Ndi said that the election would not be transparent and blamed President Paul Biya for this; he said the ruling RDPC wanted a two-thirds parliamentary majority so that the constitution could be changed in order to allow Biya to run for president again in 2011.

In addition to the SDF, the UDC also alleged fraud, and the SDF and the UDC announced that they would appeal in every district where they were defeated. Another opposition party, the Alliance of Democratic Forces (AFP), said that it would not appeal because it considered the legal system so corrupt that it would be useless to do so. President Biya, voting in Yaound√©, said that he expected \\"a comfortable majority, which will enable me to build and modernise the country.\\" He said that campaigning occurred \\"in a calm, serene and peaceful atmosphere\\", and expressed his hope that this atmosphere would remain and that people would accept the results.'Low turnout' in Cameroon voting, BBC News, 22 July 2007 ==Results== Following the announcement of the results, 103 appeals were filed with the Supreme Court by a number of parties;L√©gislatives au Cameroun: 103 recours en annulation devant la Cour supr√™me AFP , 30 July 2007 most requested the annulment of results in certain districts, although some sought only a neutral recount.

","title":"Loyalist (disambiguation)"},{"id":"9142446","text":"St Mary-at-Hill is an Anglican parish church in the Ward of Billingsgate, City of London. It is situated on Lovat Lane, a cobbled street off Eastcheap. It was founded in the 12th century as \\"St. Mary de Hull\\" or \\"St. Mary de la Hulle\\". It was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was only partially rebuilt and has been much altered since, although some of its mediaeval fabric survives. The Church of St Mary-at-Hill is situated among some of the City's most ancient lanes: St Mary at Hill EC3, in which has a large double-faced clock extending several feet into the street and which provides the best view of the church's elegant exterior; a narrow alleyway running alongside, but with no right of way; and, its entrance on Lovat Lane EC3, its postal address. ==History and architecture== St Mary-at-Hill dates to 1336. The north aisle was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, and a south aisle and steeple were added a little later. John Stow, writing at end of the 16th century, described it as \\"the fair church of Saint Marie, called on the Hill, because of the ascent from Billingsgate\\". Interior of St Mary at Hill's dome. The Great Fire of 1666 started in the neighbouring street of Pudding Lane severely damaging the church. After the blaze, the parish of St Mary's was united with that of St Andrew Hubbard, whose church was not rebuilt. Sir Christopher Wren rebuilt the church's interior and east end, managing to retain its medieval walls on the other three sides, and the west tower to which he added a lantern. Wren included in his design a venetian window at the east end, now blocked up, and a pediment, now broken. His interior displays four free-standing corinthian columns, supporting barrel vaults in a Greek cross pattern, and a coffered central dome. The church is 96 ft long and 60 ft wide. A hoard of coins (now known as the Mary Hill Hoard) was found in a basement near St Mary-at-Hill in the 18th century. The hoard included the only known example of a coin from the Horndon mint. There have been considerable further alterations since the 17th century. In 1787‚Äì88, George Gwilt rebuilt the west wall and replaced the tower in brick and in 1826‚Äì27 James Savage installed round-headed iron-framed windows in the north wall and replaced the vaults, ceilings and plasterwork. In 1848‚Äì49 he added a cupola to the dome and cut windows through the chancel vault. In 1849, the 17th century woodwork was sympathetically augmented and adapted by W. Gibbs Rogers. In 1904 the church's parish was united with that of St George Botolph Lane, and St Mary-at-Hill received the sword rests, plate, royal arms, ironwork, organ and organ case from St George. In 1939, the writer Dornford Yates used the church as a setting for some of the action in his thriller Gale Warning, calling it ‚ÄúSt. Ives‚Äù. Use is made of the open-work screens on the roof. The church survived the Blitz in the Second World War unscathed, but was severely damaged by a fire in 1988, after which its roof and ceiling required rebuilding. Though much of the woodwork, including box pews, survived the fire, it has not been reinstated and remains in store. Writing before St Mary's 1988 fire, John Betjeman said of the church: \\"This is the least spoiled and the most gorgeous interior in the City, all the more exciting by being hidden away among cobbled alleys, paved passages, brick walls, overhung by plane trees‚Ä¶\\" The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. On the street St Mary at Hill, there is an adjacent Grade II brick and stone rectory of 1834 designed by James Savage, incorporating a vestry of the late 17th century. == Music and traditions == The organ at St Mary-at-Hill Church. From 1510 the Chapel Royal choir sang here. The organ-builder Mighaell Glocetir worked at St Mary-at-Hill from 1477 to 1479. He is possibly the same person as Myghell Glancets who worked on St Michael, Cornhill, in 1475. The great composer Thomas Tallis was organist at St Mary-at-Hill between 1538‚Äì39. A William Hill organ was installed in 1848 and partly restored after the 1988 fire, but its complete restoration did not commence until 2000.William Hill's organ Mander Organs The church is a popular venue for its regular concerts and recitals. In several books on English folklore, or about ceremonies of London, there is mention of the Costermongers' Festival held here every October. It also goes by the name \\"Fish Harvest Festival\\" or \\"Harvest of the Sea\\", associated with the fishmarket that was held at Billingsgate. Another notable ceremony is Beating the Bounds, where notables and children process around the boundary of a parish or ward on Ascension Day, carrying slender rods. Originally the children were whipped (not severely) at points along the route. Almost every such example died out in the middle of the 19th century, but the account books of St Mary-at-Hill testify to its existence here. Four shillings were paid for the provision of fruit on the day of the \\"Perambulation\\" in 1682. In another example at Chelsea the whipped children were given four pence. Rare surviving examples of Beating the Bounds are at the nearby City Church of All Hallows- by-the-Tower (every three years), and at The Queen's Chapel of The Savoy, Westminster. ==Burials== c. 1975 Parliament outlawed new burials in the City of London during the Victorian era, forcing the closure of its churchyards; in 1847 the Church purchased burials rights 'in perpetuity' in a small section of the consecrated ground at West Norwood Cemetery for the parish's own use.English Heritage Survey of London: volume 26 St Mary-at-Hill in West Norwood It stood out from the main cemetery through its railed enclosure and planting, including monkey puzzle trees. The London Borough of Lambeth subsequently compulsorily-purchased the main cemetery and removed the memorials in this section during 1990‚Äì91. A subsequent Chancery Court hearing found this to be illegal and ordered a mechanism be set up to restore those monuments at the request of descendants.Friends of West Norwood Cemetery, Newsletter No 17, Jan 1994 ==Notable people== *Richard Beearde, hymn writer, was Rector of St Mary-at-Hill, 1560‚Äì1574 *Edward Young, poet and author of Night Thoughts, was married at St Mary-at-Hill in 1731 *John Brand, an antiquarian, was appointed Rector of St Mary-at-Hill in 1784 *William Turner Alchin, another antiquarian, was born 1790 in the parish *Wilson Carlile, founder of the Church Army, was a minister at the church in the late 19th/early 20th century *Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the previous priest-in-charge, was also Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons and is now, at November 2019, Bishop of Dover, the first black woman to be consecrated a bishop in the Church of England. ==See also== * List of churches and cathedrals of London * List of Christopher Wren churches in London ==References== ==External links== * The Parish Church of St Mary-at-Hill, Eastcheap * Chapel Royal (authorisation required) * British Institute of Organ Builders Medieval builders * Thomas Tallis * The medieval records of a London City church ‚Äì St Mary at Hill, 1420‚Äì1559 * www.private-eye.co.uk, Jan 2014 * 360¬∞ panorama inside St Mary-at-Hill Category:Church of England church buildings in the City of London Category:Rebuilt churches in the United Kingdom Category:Christopher Wren church buildings in London Category:Church buildings with domes Category:English Baroque architecture Category:Grade I listed churches in the City of London Category:Diocese of London Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery ","title":"St Mary-at-Hill"},{"id":"9142447","text":"Indirect presidential elections were held in Nauru on 28 August 2007.

This would make it the earliest known carnivorous plant and the only known fossil record of Sarraceniaceae, or the New World pitcher plant family. Archaeamphora is also one of the three oldest known genera of angiosperms (flowering plants). Li (2005) wrote that \\"the existence of a so highly derived Angiosperm in the Early Cretaceous suggests that Angiosperms should have originated much earlier, maybe back to 280 mya as the molecular clock studies suggested\\". Subsequent authors have questioned the identification of Archaeamphora as a pitcher plant.McPherson, S., A. Wistuba, A. Fleischmann & J. Nerz 2011. Sarraceniaceae of South America. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. ==Etymology== The generic name Archaeamphora is derived from the Greek Œ±œÅœáŒ±ŒØŒøœÇ, archa√≠os (\\"ancient\\"; combining form in Latin: archae-), and ·ºÄŒºœÜŒøœÅŒµœçœÇ, amphoreus (\\"pitcher\\"). The specific epithet longicervia is derived from the Latin longus (\\"long\\") and cervicarius (\\"with a neck\\"), in reference to the characteristic constriction in the pitcher-like structures of this species. ==Fossil material== All known fossil material of A. longicervia originates from the Jianshangou Formation in Beipiao, western Liaoning, China. These Early Cretaceous beds constitute the lower part of the Yixian Formation,Sun, G., S.-L. Zheng, D.L. Dilcher, Y.D. Wang & S.W Mei 2001. Early Angiosperms and their Associated Plants from Western Liaoning, China. Shanghai Scientific and Technological Education Publishing House, 227 pp. which is dated at 124.6 million years old. Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754. ==Description== Archaeamphora longicervia was a herbaceous plant growing to around in height. The stem, at least long by wide, bore distinctive vertical ridges and grooves. The pitcher-like structures were ascidiate in form and long. Mature pitchers and underdeveloped pitchers or phyllodia-like leaves were arranged spirally around the stem. Pitchers consisted of a tubular base, expanded middle section, constriction around the mouth, and a vertical, spoon-shaped lid. A single wing ran down the adaxial side of each pitcher. Three to five parallel major veins were present on the pitchers, along with a few intercostal veins and numerous small veinlets. Two unusual bag-like structures were present on each pitcher, one on either side of the central wing. Similar but semi-circular structures were found on the margin of the lid. These structures exhibited strong yellow-green intrinsic fluorescence when exposed to visible light with a wavelength of 500 nm (blue- green). Tiny glands, approximately 4 Œºm in diameter, were found on the inner surface of the pitchers and partially embedded in the grooves along the veins. These also showed very strong golden-yellow fluorescence. A single seed was found intimately associated with the fossil material of A. longicervia and is presumed to belong to the same species. It is winged and reticulate- tuberculate in morphology, closely resembling the seeds of Sarraceniaceae taxa. The seed is oval-shaped, covered with black-brown warts, and measures . ==Taxonomy== The fossil material of A. longicervia was subjected to chemical analysis for oleanane, considered a key marker differentiating angiosperms from gymnosperms. Oleanane was detected in these specimens, suggesting that they belong to the angiosperms. ===Pitcher plant interpretation=== According to Li (2005), several morphological features of A. longicervia indicate a close relationship to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit one or two pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers that extend vertically from the top of a short petiole. Pitchers of Sarracenia purpurea Li (2005) suggests that A. longicervia is morphologically similar to modern Sarracenia purpurea. It shares with this species the spiral arrangement of its pitchers and phyllodia- like tubular leaves with parallel major veins. Archaeamphora longicervia also shows a resemblance to species of the genus Heliamphora in having pitchers with a long neck and upright lid. Of particular note is the similarity between the thick semi-circular structures on the lid of A. longicervia and the large nectar-secreting \\"bubble\\" present on the upper posterior portion of Heliamphora exappendiculata pitchers. Li (2005) mentions the discovery of another type of \\"pitcher plant\\" from the same formation. This variety differs from the type material of A. longicervia in having pitchers that lack any constriction before the mouth, instead gradually expanding from the petiole into a hollow trumpet-like shape. He suggests that it \\"should be a different species\\" from A. longicervia. An intermediate form with a wider neck is also reported, suggesting that these plants were already a diversified group in the Early Cretaceous. ===Current understanding=== He≈ômanov√° & Kvaƒçek (2010) opined that the pitcher plant interpretation of Archaeamphora is \\"problematic and the fossil is in need of revision\\". In their 2011 book, Sarraceniaceae of South America, McPherson et al. summarised current thinking on Archaeamphora as follows: > Serious doubt is emerging that reduces the likelihood that Archaeamphora > longicervia belongs in the Sarraceniaceae lineage, or was even a pitcher > plant at all. [...] Although Archaeamphora might well be a representative of > the earliest flowering plants on Earth [...] it is very unlikely that it > represents an ancestor of Sarraceniaceae since it is much too old to be part > of the advanced \\"crown group\\" of Ericales to which Sarraceniaceae belong. > [...] Another contradiction is that except for Archaeamphora, there is no > other evidence to suggest that Sarraceniaceae evolved outside the New World, > to which all extant members of the family are endemic. Wong et al. (2015) put forward a new perspective [16] as follows: > Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was described as an herbaceous, > Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian > Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation > of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights > into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We > demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf > galls that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) > an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of > sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like > angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported > gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation. ==Habitat== The area inhabited by A. longicervia is thought to have experienced significant climatic fluctuations during the Early Cretaceous, ranging from arid or semi-arid to more humid conditions. The substrate in the region was mostly composed of lacustrine sediments and volcanic rocks. ==See also== * Cephalotus follicularis, an Australian carnivorous plant whose pitcher traps are convergently similar to those of Nepenthes ==Notes== ==References== 16\\\\.

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. She was with her boss, Abraham Zapruder, as he made the Zapruder film, the most studied record of the assassination. ==Early years== Sitzman was born in Lafayette, Colorado and attended the University of Colorado at Boulder before moving to Dallas.\\"Zapruder aide Marilyn Sitzman dies\\", The Dallas Morning News, August 14, 1993, p. 40A. After moving to Dallas, Sitzman got a job as a receptionist at dress manufacturer Abraham Zapruder's clothing company Jennifer Juniors. ==Witness to JFK's assassination== Zapruder's clothing company was located in the Dal-Tex Building at 501 Elm Street, one block from Dealey Plaza through which the presidential motorcade would be passing on November 22. The Dal-Tex building is located across the street from the Texas School Book Depository. Sitzman's boss, Abraham Zapruder, arrived at work that morning without his 8 mm movie camera as he decided not to film the motorcade because it was raining that morning. By mid-morning, the rain had cleared and Zapruder's secretary Lillian Rogers encouraged him to go home to retrieve his camera to film the motorcade. Zapruder initially decided to film the motorcade from the window of his office but later decided to film from Dealey Plaza as the angle was better. He chose a concrete abutment which extends from a retaining wall that was part of the John Neely Bryan concrete pergola on the grassy knoll north of Elm Street, in Dealey Plaza. Sitzman offered to join Zapruder as he suffered from vertigo and was apprehensive about standing on the abutment unassisted. Sitzman and Zapruder climbed on top of the 4-foot (1.2 m) high pedestal. While Sitzman stood behind Zapruder and held his coat to steady him, he began filming the presidential motorcade as it turned on Houston Street onto Elm Street. The fatal head shot struck President Kennedy as his limousine passed almost directly in front of their position, 65 feet (20 m) from the center of Elm Street.Bugliosi 2008 p.453 Sitzman went on record about the direction of the shots she heard, stating that they came from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository. Sitzman rejected the theory that one or more shots came from behind the 5-foot (1.5 m) high stockade fence atop the knoll: Between Sitzman and the stockade fence was a 3.3-foot (1 m) high, L-shaped concrete alcove along the path from the stairway up the knoll to the area behind the pergola. Some assassination researchers, studying vague shapes in a photograph taken by Mary Moorman from across the street just after the fatal head shot, saw the so-called \\"badge man\\" aiming a rifle from this area. Another person, Gordon Arnold, came forth in 1978 to claim that he had been standing in that area taking a film of the motorcade. ==Later years and death== In the years following the assassination, Sitzman was interviewed by various researchers and writers. The Warren Commission, a Presidential Commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the assassination, never interviewed Sitzman. When later asked why she was never called before the Commission, Sitzman stated, \\"Because it was [the 1960s], I was female and I was young. And I was irrelevant.\\"Sabato 2013 p.143 On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission released an 888-page report that concluded there was no evidence of a conspiracy and Lee Harvey Oswald, a former United States Marine that was arrested in connection with the shooting of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit and later became a suspect in the assassination, acted alone in killing President Kennedy and Officer Tippit. In an interview with researcher Josiah Thompson conducted on November 29, 1966, rediscovered in 1985, Sitzman gave eyewitness testimony to who was in the alcove below her and about nine yards (8.2 m) to her right: a young black couple was sitting on a bench, eating lunch and drinking sodas. When the shots rang out, the couple ran along the path to the area behind the pergola. Sitzman recalled hearing a soda bottle breaking as they ran. Asked if she saw anyone else in this area between the concrete wall and the stockade fence, Sitzman said no, only the couple. Over the years, Sitzman continued to maintain that the shots she heard came from the direction of the Texas School Book Depository but added that she believed there was a possibility that there was a second gunman. Sitzman stated, \\"I have no qualms saying that I'm almost sure that there was someone behind the fence or in that area up there [near the fence], but I'm just as sure that they had silencers because there was no sound.\\"Sabato 2013 pp.143-144 Sitzman died of cancer on August 11, 1993 at age 53 in Mesquite, Texas. ==In popular culture== Sitzman was portrayed by Lynne Rostochil in Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK and by Bitsie Tulloch in Peter Landesman's 2013 film Parkland. ==References== ==External links== * Marilyn Sitzman reenacts her position for Life magazine. * Marilyn Sitzman on the set of JFK in 1991. * View of stockade fence from Sitzman's position. * Martin Shackelford, R.I.P.: The Black Dog Man.

Location of Ch√¢teau d'√âtelan in France. The Ch√¢teau d'√âtelan is a historical building in the commune of Saint- Maurice-d'√âtelan in the Seine-Maritime d√©partement in Normandy, France. Situated on the right bank of the Seine between the Brotonne and Tancarville bridges, the Ch√¢teau d‚Äô√âtelan commands a site overlooking the final loop of the river Seine. Originally designed as a castle, it was later converted to a 15th-century flamboyant gothic mansion. == Place name == It is not known if the village gave its name to the first castle, or the opposite. It was called Esteilant in 1050-1066, from the Old English landFran√ßois de Beaurepaire, Les noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de la Seine-Maritime, √©ditions Picard 1979. and maybe Old English stƒìƒ°ili that means \\"steep\\" or \\"sheer\\".English Etymology, T. F. Hoad, OUP. Many farmers from the Danelaw had settled in Normandy with the Danes in the 10th century,Georges Bernage, Les vikings et la Normandie, √©ditions Copernic 1979. which explains why there are typical Old English place name elements in the Norman toponymy, for example: croft > crot > croc(q): Vannecrocq (Wanescrotum 11th century) = Walshcroft, Lincolnshire or stƒÅn > esta(i)n, √©ta(i)n: Fatouville-Grestain (Grestano 11th century) = Garston, Hertfordshire (Grestan 11th century) 'great stone', etc.Fran√ßois de Beaurepaire, Les noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de l'Eure, √©ditions Picard 1981. Simon the Norman is well known in England from the story of his dismissal and disgrace by Henry III early in 1240, but less as Master Simon of Steland (or Steyland, de Esteilant, de Esteyland) whom Henry presented to the archdeaconry of Norfolk in May 1237. He originated from this place. ==History== In 1494 Louis Picart, magistrate of Troyes and Tournaisis, friend and chamberlain of King Louis XII with whom he went to Italy, undertook the construction of the chateau. In August 1563, the Regent, Catherine de' Medici and the young King Charles IX visited √âtelan, having just recaptured Le Havre from the English (27 July 1563). Thus it was in √âtelan that Regent, advised by Michel de l'H√¥pital decided to proclaim one year early the majority of the King (4 August 1563). At √âtelan she had drawn up, signed and sealed the letter proclaiming \\"the King‚Äôs of age\\" convening the Parliament of Rouen to register the summons. History or legend tells us that the following people have spent time at √âtelan : Louis XI (6 June ‚Äì 13 July 1475), Francis I (during the construction of le Havre), Catherine de' Medici and Charles IX with the future kings Henry III and Henry IV, Marguerite de Navarre and Michel de l'H√¥pital (August, 1563), Voltaire (1723‚Äì1724). Andr√© Caplet, composer and winner of the Grand Prix of Rome often stayed in √âtelan and composed some of his works there including Mass for three voices. == Description == The ch√¢teau is listed as a monument historique in the Historical Monuments File of the French Ministry of Culture. Completed in 1494 by Louis Picart, the Ch√¢teau d‚Äô√âtelan was built on the site of a fortress which has been destroyed under the order of Louis XI. Of the medieval construction, only the cellar, the castle wall and the guard house dating from 1350 remain. Constructed in a flamboyant Gothic style, it is the contemporary with the Law Court and the h√¥tel de Bourgtheroulde in Rouen and as old as the Ch√¢teau de Cl√®res. The building consists of two dwellings built from layers of bricks and stones and joined together by a magnificent stone staircase dating from the first Renaissance. As integral part of the main building, the Chapel, dedicated to Mary Magdalene, include stained glass windows, wall paintings and statues which characterised the first Norman Renaissance.

The President of Albania is elected through a secret vote and without debate by the Parliament of Albania by a majority of three-fifths majority of all its members. The Constitution of Albania sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. When this majority is not reached in the first round of voting, a second round takes place within seven days. If such a majority is still not reached, a third round must take place within a further period of seven days. If even in the first three rounds no candidate has attained the necessary majority, a further two rounds must be held within seven days, with the majority needed to win being reduced to an absolute majority (50% + 1 vote) vote of the total members of the Parliament. If after five rounds of voting no candidate has attained the necessary majority outlined for each round of voting in the Parliament, the Parliament will be dissolved and a general election must occur within 60 days. == Early elections == In 2002, Alfred Moisiu was elected as a consensual president and was accepted by both the majority and the opposition parties. The parties would not agree to reelect Moisiu despite his agreement to stand as a compromise candidate. Neither Bamir Topi of the right nor Fatos Nano or Edi Rama of the left had the necessary supermajority in parliament, and therefore it was considered to be very likely that early elections would have to be held after five failed attempts to elect the president. Current prime minister and former president Sali Berisha had advocated for a president elected by direct popular suffrage, but due to lack of time, such changes could not take place before the 2007 elections. On 12 July 2007, Rama officially called for early elections.People's Daily Online - Albanian opposition asks for early elections A majority of Albanians were against early elections. == Vote == In the first two attempts for the first round of voting (on 20 June and 27 June), no candidate was presented. On 5 July 2007, the government and the opposition presented their proposed candidate lists, but did not accept either list; they agreed to meet on 6 July 2007 to start another attempt on finding a consensus candidate, which failed. (The opposition had proposed Albania's military representative to NATO, Brig. Gen. Arjan Zaimi, as a compromise candidate, but the government rejected him.) They then set the third attempt of the first round of voting (the first one to actually see any candidate stand for the post) for 8 July. Topi was the official nominee of the ruling coalition, while Nano did not stand as the opposition's candidate (his own party does not support him as a candidate), but de facto as an independent. === First round === The first round of voting on 8 July gave the following results (the opposition boycotted the vote due to the lack of a consensus candidate). * Bamir Topi: 75 votes * Fatos Nano: 3 votes ===Second round=== The second round on 11 July was again boycotted by the opposition and had the following results: * Bamir Topi: 74 votes (84 votes were necessary to secure the post) * Fatos Nano: 5 votes === Third round === While the opposition continued its boycott on 14 July in the third round, a new candidate entered the field: Neritan Ceka, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance Party. Since he and Topi got the most votes, they proceeded to the fourth round. For the first time, more than the 84 members of parliament necessary for a valid election were present. * Bamir Topi: 50 votes * Neritan Ceka: 32 votes * Fatos Nano: 3 votes === Fourth round === In the fourth and potentially penultimate round on 20 July, 90 parliamentarians were present, including ten from the opposition. The results this time were: * Bamir Topi: 85 votes * Neritan Ceka: 5 votes These surprising results stifled the impending early elections; Topi's election was only possible because five opposition members voted for him instead of Ceka. == See also == * Politics of Albania * President of Albania == References == Category:2007 elections in Europe Category:2007 in Albania Category:April 2017 events in Europe 2007 ","title":"2007 Albanian presidential election"},{"id":"9142541","text":"Mariekerke is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

For the first time in the history of elections in Morocco, they are being monitored by foreign observers including the U.S.'s National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and 42 others. Turnout in the election was only 37% - the lowest in the history of Moroccan national elections. The Socialist Union of People's Forces (USFP), the largest party in the outgoing government lost nearly a quarter of its seats, and was replaced as the largest party by its coalition partner, the Istiqlal Party. The main gainers were the pro-government liberal People's Movement and Constitutional Union parties. The opposition Islamist Justice and Development Party had a modest increase in its tally as did the pro-government leftist Party of Progress and Socialism. Following the election the USFP was expected to leave the governing coalition.Moroccan elections bring victory for conservatives, Magharebia, 2007-09-10, accessed on 2007-09-12 Istiqlal Party leader Abbas El Fassi became PM on 19 September 2007. ==Results== { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2Party !colspan=3National seats !colspan=3Local seats !rowspan=2Total seats !rowspan=2+/‚Äì - !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats - align=leftJustice and Development Party545,63613.46503,39610.94046+4 - align=leftIndependence Party480,56111.86494,25610.74652+4 - align=leftNational Rally of Independents429,05310.55447,2449.73439‚Äì4 - align=leftPopular Movement410,19710.05426,8499.33641+14 - align=leftSocialist Union of Popular Forces389,4719.55408,9458.93338‚Äì12 - align=leftParty of Progress and Socialism253,9296.23248,1035.41417+6 - align=leftPND‚ÄìAl Ahd Union217,8275.30 139,6883.088‚Äì - align=leftFront of Democratic Forces200,8464.90207,9824.599‚Äì3 - align=leftDemocratic and Social Movement163,7994.00168,9603.799+2 - align=leftLabour Party139,9073.40140,2243.055+5 - align=leftEnvironment and Development Party133,0233.30131,5242.955+3 - align=leftPADS‚ÄìCNI‚ÄìPSU Union119,6882.9098,2022.155‚Äì - align=leftParty of Renewal and Equity95,4562.3083,5161.844+4 - align=leftMoroccan Union for Democracy76,0491.9076,7951.722+2 - align=leftSocialist Party70,6071.7067,7861.522+2 - align=leftMoroccan Liberal Party58,4191.4046,5261.000‚Äì3 - align=leftCitizen Initiative for Development51,2171.3050,2781.111+1 - align=leftReform and Development Party50,2851.2047,1411.000‚Äì3 - align=leftParty of Renaissance and Virtue39,1341.0036,7810.811+1 - align=leftCitizens' Forces33,7640.8031,2070.711‚Äì1 - align=leftDemocratic Independence Party35,9220.9031,1050.700‚Äì2 - align=leftAction Party30,7890.8024,3840.5000 - align=leftSocial Centre Party26,2400.6022,8260.5000 - align=leftParty of Hope23,1070.6016,3760.4000 - align=leftParty of Liberty and Social Justice11,5680.305,4520.1000 - align=leftConstitutional Union‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì335,1167.32727+11 - align=leftCovenant Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì57,9521.333‚Äì - align=leftNational Democratic Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì56,1761.233‚Äì - align=leftAlliance of Liberties‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì34,8010.811‚Äì3 - align=leftNational Congress Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì25,6950.611‚Äì - align=leftUnited Socialist Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì20,3530.400‚Äì - align=leftParty of al-Badil al- Hadari‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì15,6000.3000 - align=leftDemocratic Socialist Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì10,9730.200‚Äì6 - align=leftRenaissance Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì10,1560.2000 - align=leftDemocratic Socialist Vanguard Party‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì3,7610.100‚Äì - align=leftIndependents‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì81,3641.855+5 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes1,634,579‚Äì‚Äì1,131,393‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì - align=leftTotal5,721,073100305,738,8861002953250 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout15,462,36237.00‚Äì15,462,36237.12‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì - align=left colspan=9Source: Desrues & Garcia } ==External links== * Official 2007 elections website * Political leaflets from the 2007 elections ==References== Category:2007 elections in Africa Category:Elections in Morocco Category:2007 in Morocco ","title":"2007 Moroccan general election"},{"id":"9142604","text":"General elections were held in Jamaica on 3 September 2007.

He was nominated for Academy Awards for two of his short films, La gazza ladra (The Thieving Magpie) (1965) and Pulcinella (1973). ==Biography== He was born in Genoa and turned to drawing in 1938 when, as a son of a Jew (from the part of his father), his academic studies were interrupted by the introduction of the Fascist racial laws. He moved to Switzerland with his family and studied in Lausanne, where he obtained his degree at the local √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He designed his first production of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in 1944, a collaboration with his friends Alessandro Fersen, Aldo Trionfo and Guido Lopez. He returned to Italy after the war. His first work as an animator was the short film I paladini di Francia, together with Giulio Gianini, in 1960. He provided designs for the London Festival Ballet, the Chicago Opera House, the Vienna Staatsoper and the Glyndebourne Festival, including several Mozart productions and Verdi's Macbeth produced by Michael Hadjimischev in 1972. Luzzati was interested in tarot symbolism, which he used in scenographies for Fabrizio de Andr√© concerts in the 1990s. One of Luzzati's books (based on a theatre production) was, in the English-language version, Ronald and the Wizard Calico, a fairy tale in verse (translated English). The Picture Lion paperback edition (William Collins, London, 1973) is a paperback imprint of the Hutchinson Junior Books edition (1969), which credits the English translation to Hutchinson Junior Books, and cites Ugo Mursia Editore 1962 as the Italian language first published version. (The title in Italian is ‚ÄúI Paladini de Francia ovvero il tradimento di Gano di Maganza‚Äù, which translates literally as ‚ÄúThe Paladins of France or the treachery of Gano of Maganz‚Äù.) This story is an ancient one / That minstrels often tell, Of battles, love and treachery, / And magic things as well. The story (the English version, but with the same illustrations as the Italian original) of Ronald and the Wizard Calico, is about the knight, brave Captain Ronald, his valiant charger (a horse) called Fred, and Ronald's golden knights, who are the good guys, guarding the lovely Rosalie in their castle fort. Nearby, in a ‚Äúlovely lake‚Äù Wizard Calico makes his (good) magic, and flies around on the back of his magic bluebird. However, ‚Äúwicked green knights in green / [have] Crept up and hid behind a hill‚Äù. They plan to kidnap Rosalie and take her to become ‚Äúthe reluctant wife of Sultan Suhlimann‚Äù. Alas, Gano, a wicked traitor in Ronald's fort, makes his own magic, creating the illusion of another castle on a nearby hill: ‚ÄúAt all the open windows there / Stood many lovely girls / With blue eyes and with hair which hung / In long and golden curls. / The damsels called to Ronald's knights / And asked round for tea, / So all the army marched away / And left poor Rosalie‚Äù. Gano opens the gates to the green knights, and rush away with Rosalie. ‚ÄúNo doubt you'll have forgotten now / The Wizard Calico, / But luckily for everyone / He saw the traitor go.‚Äù The plot thickens. More magic spells are cast; battle ensues; villains are brought to justice ‚Äì and ‚ÄúThen Ronald married Rosalie, / As all had hoped he would. / So this tale has a happy end, / As all the best tales should ... / So there it is, a stirring tale, / As at the start I said. / But now it's time to close the book / And quietly go to bed‚Äù. (This antepenultimate page includes a gem-like image of Wizard Calico, himself, riding on the back of his magic bluebird, brandishing a flag with the word ‚ÄúEND‚Äù ‚Äì or ‚ÄúFINE‚Äù in the original Italian. Indeed!) The attractive and amusing illustrations, by Emanuele Luzatti (the famous Twentieth century Italian-Swiss artist, theatre set and costume designer, film animator, and more), resemble a Punch and Judy booth and puppets, as if drawn and coloured by Georges Rouault, with a black-edged folk-na√Øve style and stained-glass window-like colours. (The Bayeux tapestry also comes to mind.) The third-last page in the original Italian is: Viva Rinaldo, il vincitore, / viva la sposa sua, Biancofiore, / viva Ricardo e i paladini, / viva la chioccia col suoi pulcini, / viva il catello che non c‚Äôe piu, / viva il mago Urluberlu. [Literally, Viva, or Long live, or Hooray for Rinaldo, the winner, viva his bride, Biancifiore, viva Ricardo and his paladins or knights, long live the mother hen with her chicks, long live the chateau and there is more, long live the Urluberlu magician.] Abbasso i mori, abasso il sultano, morte, supplizio, tortura per Gano, chi vuol esser lieto sia, larga la foglia, lunga la via. [Literally, Down with the Moors, down with the Sultan; death, torture, torture to Gano, who wants be happy, the leaf wide, long the way.] The original Italian story was also in simple rhymed verse, and seems to have been about a beautiful maiden called Biancofiore ‚Äì Whiteflower, or Blanche ‚Äì and her brave hero, Captain Rinaldo, and Ricardo and his paladins ‚Äì the term used for Christian knights engaged in Crusades against the Saracens and Moore. Against these good people are the wicked Moors ‚Äì North African Muslims and Arabs ‚Äì and their Sultan. The catalyst for victory seems to have been the magician called Urlubulu, who may have had help from a mother hen and her chickens, possibly also magic. Clearly the English translators, using the original illustrations, and the basic rhyme patterns, have slightly simplified the plot, and eliminated the Christians-versus-Muslim-Moors conflict, replacing it with gold versus green. In other words, we have a retelling, or re-imagining of one of the legends of Roland, the famous French knight, or paladin, who fought the Moors, as they were known, in Spain, and, famously, stopped the conquest of France, as recorded in the verse saga, The Song of Roland, or La Chanson de Roland, and the legendary hero of the Orlando stories, such as Orlando Furioso, retold, or re-imagined for children. ==Works in EnglishBooks in English=== *Chichibio and the crane, New York, Obelensky, 1962 * Ronald and the wizard Calico, New York, Pantheon, 1969, and London, Hutchinson, 1969 * Ali Baba and the forty thieves, New York, Pantheon, 1969 * When it rains...it rains, New York, Rinehart & Winston, 1970 (text by Bill Martin jr.) * Whistle, Mary, Whistle, New York, Rinehart & Winston, 1970 (text by Bill Martin jr.) * The magic flute, Oxford, Blackwell, 1971 * The travels of Marco Polo, London, Dent, 1975 * Walking and talking with Yoav, Tel Aviv, Sifriat Poalim, 1976 (text by Michal Snunit) * Cinderella, London, Bluth, 1981 * Michael and the monster of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Tower of David Museum, 1989 (text by Meir Shalev) === Stage designs in English-speaking countries === *The Magic Flute, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1963 *Macbeth, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1964 *Carmina Burana, Chicago Lyric Opera, 1965 *L'heure espagnole, Chicago Lyric Opera, 1965 *A Midsummer Night's Dream, English Opera Group, 1967 *Don Giovanni, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1967 *Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1968 *Le Rossignol, Chicago Lyric Opera, 1968 *Cos√¨ fan tutte, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1969 *Sette canzoni by Gian Francesco Malipiero, Edinburgh International Festival, 1969 *El Amor Brujo, Chicago Lyric Opera, 1969 *La Cenerentola, Scottish Opera, 1969 *Il Turco in Italia, Glyndebourne Festival Opera, 1970 *Don Quixote, London Festival Ballet, 1970 *L'Italiana in Algeri, Chicago Lyric Opera, 1970 *Il mercato di Malmantile by Domenico Cimarosa, Lincoln Center, 1974 *Oberon, Opera Theater of Saint Louis, 1988 *Candide, Opera Theater of Saint Louis, 1994 ==References== * Sergio Noberini, Lista cronologica delle scenografie di Emanuele Luzzati in Giorgio Ursini Ur≈°iƒç and Andrea Rauch (editors), Emanuele Luzzati.

Upon completion of his training he was promoted to rank of Lieutenant and posted to Arakan Signals Barracks in Apapa, Lagos, Nigeria as an officer of the Nigerian Army Signal Corps. While at Arakan, he was appointed as a staff officer to then Brigadier General Mohammed who was brigade commander of signals at the time. Brigadier General Mohammed was soon appointed as Minister of Communications by the Yakubu Gowon regime and took Akinsehinwa along with him as a personnel staff officer and technical assistant. On July 29, 1975, General Mohammed was made head of state (succeeding Gowon) by younger soldiers who wanted to ensure Nigeria's return to democratic rule. He was not directly involved in the coup d'√©tat that brought him to power, but he had played a prominent role in rallying northern officers behind the July 1966 coup that felled Aguiyi-Ironsi. Upon becoming Head of State, Murtala appointed Akinsehinwa as his Aide-de-Camp (a role usually reserved for a senior officer such as a Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel). Mohammed citing Akinsehinwa's hard work, wit and intelligence, appointed Akinsehinwa as Aide-de-Camp effectively making him the youngest (Age ‚Äì 30) and lowest ranking presidential Aide-de- Camp in Nigerian history. In a short time, Mohammed's policies won him broad popular support, and his decisiveness elevated him to the status of a national hero. ==Death== On Friday the 13th of February 1976, General Mohammed's motorcade was ambushed in Lagos by coup plotters and assassins amid an abortive coup d'√©tat. The coup plotters unleashed a hail of bullets on Mohammed's black Mercedes Benz limousine (not bulletproof) killing him instantly. Mohammed's driver and orderly were also killed instantly. However, Akinsehinwa survived the initial barrage of bullets and exited the limousine to return fire. Unfortunately, he was overpowered and eventually succumbed to a hail of bullets (an autopsy revealed six bullet wounds in his back). Akintunde Akinsehinwa at 31 years of age thus became the first aide-de-camp to die in the line of duty while serving a Nigerian head of state. ==External links== * The Dimka's Coup Attempt of February 13, 1976 * Murtala Ramat Mohammed * Dimka's Failed Coup Attempt * Akintunde Akinsehinwa Foundation Category:1944 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Ondo City Category:Yoruba military personnel Category:Nigerian Army officers Category:Military personnel of the Nigerian Civil War Category:Participants in the 1976 Nigerian military coup Category:People murdered in Lagos Category:Deaths by firearm in Nigeria Category:1976 crimes in Nigeria Category:1970s murders in Nigeria Category:1976 murders in Africa ","title":"Akintunde Akinsehinwa"},{"id":"9142706","text":"Jesus Tamayo Peralta (born December 26, 1932 in Ft.

The communities which celebrate this ritual are descended from refugees who entered Greece from Eastern Thrace following the Balkan Wars of 1911‚Äì12 and the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923.Xygalatas, Dimitris, 2012.

Anthropologie, Ethnologie et Science des Religions (AESR), n¬∞ 3604325, 12 d√©cembre 2003, par Christine Djankoff ==Ritual cycle== The Bulgarian and Greek villages perform a unique annual ritual cycle, which begins on May 21 and ends on May 23 every year. The central figures of the tradition are Saint Constantine and Saint Helen, but all the significant days in this cycle coincide with important days in the Greek Orthodox calendar and are related to various Christian saints. The two major events in this cycle are two big festivals, one in January and particularly one in May, dedicated to these two saints. Each of the festivals lasts for 3 days and involves various processions, music and dancing, and an animal sacrifice. The festival culminates with a firewalking ritual, where the participants, carrying the icons of saints Constantine and Helen, dance ecstatically for hours before entering the fire and walking barefoot over the glowing-red coals, unharmed by the fire.Danforth, Loring M., Firewalking and Religious Healing: The Anastenaria of Greece and the American Firewalking Movement, Princeton University Press, (Princeton, 1989) Each community of the Anastenaria has a special shrine known as the konaki, where their holy icons are placed, as well as the \\"signs\\" of the saints (semadia), votive offerings and red kerchiefs attached to the icons. Here, on the Eve of the saints' day, May 20 Saint Constantine and Saint Helen, they gather to dance to the music of the Thracian lyre and drum. After some time they believe that they may be \\"seized\\" by Saint Constantine and enter a trance. On the morning of the Saints' day, May 21, the gather at the konaki and proceed to a well to be blessed with holy water, and sacrifice animals. The rules about the nature of the beasts to be slain are precise, but differ from village to village. In the evening a fire is lit in an open space, and after dancing for some time in the konaki, the \\"anastenarides\\" go to it carrying their ikons. After dancing around it in a circle, individual anastenarides dance over the hot coals as the saint moves them. The ritual is also performed in January, during the festival of Saint Athanasius, and fire-walking is done indoors. ==Origins== According to some myths the custom originated in the Middle Ages when the church of Saint Constantine in their original home in Kosti, now in Bulgaria, caught fire, and the voices of the saints calling for help could be heard from inside. The villagers who braved the flames to rescue them were unharmed, being protected by the saints. Other ethnographers, however, have argued that the Anastenaria are vestiges of ancient practices of cults of Dionysus.Kakouri, Katerina, Dionysiaka, (Athens, 1965)Megas, George A., Greek Calendar Customs, 3rd ed. (Athens, 1982) In Bulgaria, the right to perform the ritual was hereditary and the head nestinar was succeeded only by his or her son or daughter, and only when he or she was too old or ill to continue performing it. The head nestinar's house was sacred, because it housed the stolnina (—Å—Ç–æ–ª–Ω–∏–Ω–∞) ‚Äì a small chapel where icons of several saints were arranged, as well as a sacred drum used specifically for the ritual and believed to cure the drummer if he was ill. ==Tourism== In the 20th century the ritual became commercialized and is performed for tourists in the seaside resorts of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast by people who have little to do with the original tradition. The rituals survive in more authentic form in five villages of northern Greece: Ayia Eleni, Langadas, Melike, Mavrolefke, and Kerkine; and in six Bulgarian villages in the Strandzha Mountains: Balgari, Gramatikovo, Slivarovo, Kondolovo, Kosti, and Brodilovo. ==Heritage== In 2009, the ritual was entered in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists and the National Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage \\"Living Human Treasures - Bulgaria\\" on the application of the Regional historical museum Burgas. Nestinari Nunataks on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, are named after the Bulgarian folkloric ritual of Nestinari. ==References== ==External links== * Thinkquest * Article about the nestinari on the Bulgarian National Radio website * Nestinari * Anastenaria * Nestinari * Turkish Anastenaria * The Anastenaria: The Ancient Ecstatic Fire- Walking Ritual of Greece * Nikov, Nikolay.

It is bounded by the city limits of Poway on the east, Ted Williams Parkway on the north, Interstate 15 on the west, and the community of Miramar Ranch North to the south. Sabre Springs is bisected north-south by Poway Road. The surrounding communities are Carmel Mountain to the north, Rancho Pe√±asquitos to the west, and Scripps Ranch to the south. Sabre Springs also features a business park which includes several notable businesses such as General Atomics - Aeronautical (composite manufacturing facility), Bridgepoint Education and Hospira. The telephone area code is 858, and the ZIP code is 92128. ==History== Three Native American cultural groups have occupied Sabre Springs in three different periods. The San Dieguito from 12,000 to 8,000 years ago, the La Jolla from 8,000 to 3,000 years ago, and the Northern Diegueno from 2,500 years to the Spanish period. Site surveys indicate two villages. One was located along Chicarita Creek, and the other along Pe√±asquitos Creek.http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/profiles/pdf/cp/cpssplngcontext.pdf After the Spanish arrival, the area that became Sabre Springs was located near the two large ranches of Rancho Pe√±asquitos and Rancho Bernardo. The area was operated variously as cattle and sheep ranches by a series of owners in the 1800s and 1900s.http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/profiles/pdf/cp/cpssplngcontext.pdf In the 1900s, a considerable portion of what is now Sabre Springs was owned by the family of swimmer Florence Chadwick. It was subsequently owned by the Sabre Petroleum Corporation. Until the 1980s, there was no substantial development of the land.http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/profiles/pdf/cp/cpssplngcontext.pdf No plans to develop this area existed until the 1970s. In 1979, the City of San Diego formulated a growth management policy to guide development within the city. In 1982, the Sabre Springs Community Plan was adopted that laid out a largely residential community with industrial areas and large open spaces.http://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/profiles/pdf/cp/cpssplngcontext.pdf Pardee Homes began construction of the residential neighborhoods, the first of which opened in 1985. Residential construction continued throughout the 1990s, and Sabre Springs was largely built-out by 2010. ==Parks== Sabre Springs Park is located east of the intersection of Sabre Springs Parkway and Evening Creek Drive South. It features two tot-lots and two Little League fields. South Creek Park is located on Wickerbay Cove and is next to Creekside Elementary School. It features a playground, Little League field, and direct access to the Pe√±asquitos Creek trail. North of Ted Williams Parkway is the Carmel Mountain Ranch / Sabre Springs Recreation Center. This park is technically entirely within Carmel Mountain, despite sharing its name between both communities. It contains basketball courts, two baseball diamonds, and a playground. Two trails run through Sabre Springs. One is located along Chicarita Creek between Evening Creek Drive and Sabre Springs Parkway. A second trail runs along Pe√±asquitos Creek between Springhurst Drive and Interstate 15.

It has about 1300 inhabitants. Because of its relatively late foundation, Nieuw- en Sint Joosland is not a churchvillage, but more of a wegdorp, despite its clear villagecenter. == History: polders and villages in the 17th and 18th centuries == Nieuw- en Sint Joosland arose in the seventeenth century, during the time the 'Sloe', the water that split Walcheren in two, began to bog down and the area began to be interesting for polders. In 1603 the city Middelburg buys part of the salt marsh, to sell it in 1644 to the mayor. In 1631 the 'Oud-Sint Jooslandpolder' arises, followed by the 'Middelburgse polder' in 1644. A small core arises in the 'Oud-Sint Jooslandpolder', the actual 'Sint Joosland', but it didn't get any bigger; this hamlet is now called 'Oudedorp'. On this new land are, besides some farms, eight sawmills. These helped a lot with the blooming trade. People called the 'Middelburgse polder' usually 'Nieuw land' (New Land). Multiple polders followed: in 1661 the 'Nieuwerkerkepolder' (Newchurchpolder), in 1671 the 'Nieuw-Sint Jooslandpolder' and in 1672 the 'Molenpolder' (Millpolder). This area isn't reachable by land so a ferry over the Welzinge was created. In 1650 the island was big enough for its own church. == Municipality == In 1816 the two municipality, Nieuwland en Sint Joosland, merge into the new municipality Nieuw- en Sint Joosland, even though the last municipality existed of only one street, the still existing hamlet 'Oudedorp' (Zeelandic: 't Ouwe Durp) and a few farms. Two years later a dam is build through 'Welzinge' connecting the island with the old 'Walcheren'. Middelburg had already dug a channel to Veere, but this was no longer needed. Because of this the wood industry in 'Nieuw- en Sint Joosland' was redundant, thats why they concetrated on agriculture instead. In 1966 the village 'Nieuwland' and the hamlet 'Oudedorp' got added to Middelburg. More than half of the territory, almost 8 km¬≤, goes to the municipality Vlissingen, around 7 km¬≤ to Middelburg and 7 ha to Arnemuiden. During the municipal reorganization of 1997 the village gets the northern part of the 'Nieuw- en Sint Jooslandpolder' back from Vlissingen. == Buildings == The Dutch Reformed Church of 'Nieuwland' was built in 1882; the wall around the church is still from the old church. A bit outside the village is the gristmill 'Buiten Verwachting', built in 1874.

Its transmitter is located near Bragg Boulevard in Fayetteville. ==History== WFNC-FM signed on in 1947 and was the only FM station in Fayetteville for many years. Victor Dawson, who started out managing WFNC for his father, was one of the few to realize that FM had a future. In 1969, when WFNC-FM became WQSM and began playing country music, few cars had FM radios and WQSM began selling converters to potential listeners.Michael Futch, \\"Vic Dawson's Vision Changed Fayetteville Radio,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, December 1, 1995. On Monday March 8, 1976, WQSM gave up its country music format and switched formats with its sister station WFNC/940 AM (now 640 AM). WQSM started playing top 40 music and WFNC took over the country music format. WQSM featured an automated Stereo Rock format until 1984. WQSM continued to play top 40 music until 1989. Sunday afternoon staples were Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 and \\"American Top 40\\" with Casey Kasem. The AM carried \\"American Country Countdown\\" with Don Bowman, then Bob Kingsley. WQSM used the slogan HitRadio Q98.Dr. Anthony Harrington, 1977 graduate of Radio TV Broadcasting CCTI Sanford, NC, former Lead Instructor of Broadcast Production Technology at Triton High School, Erwin, NC (1988-1999) and Lead History Instructor CCCC Sanford, NC 1999-2013 retired. For nearly 14 years ending on October 18, 1989, WQSM played Top 40, starting with the automated TM (See Jones Radio Networks) Stereo Rock format. Q98 took 18 months to reach number one, and in April 1982, the station had 25.4 percent of listeners 12 and over in Cumberland County, the largest market share for any FM station in the country. In 1984 Jay Andrews was hired from CHR WZGC Atlanta as WQSM's Program Director to manage and take the station live 24/7. Andrews handled mornings 6am-10am. His show included news twice per hour and banter between himself, numerous listener call-ins, and News Director Bill McClement. In one ratings cycle Andrews established the highest morning ratings in the station's history. Bringing popular acts Kool & The Gang, KISS, Bon Jovi, A Flock Of Seagulls and others added to Q98's success. Working with the city of Fayetteville to promote the newly furbished 'Fayetteville Commons' downtown, Q98 hosted a street dance attended by several thousand to introduce the city's new downtown area. Contesting included The Dollar Bill Game and album 6-pack give-a-ways. WQSM's ratings increased to a 26 12+ share of the market, and in 1986 WQSM was listed by Billboard Magazine as the 11th highest-coming CHR FM in America. Andrews left WQSM in 1987 for ownership of WDGR. After Scott McLeod was hired a program director, the station gradually began moving in a more adult direction.

It is subdivided into 5 different Free Areas, 3 of which have been allotted to commercial activities. The remaining two, the Mineral Oils Free Area and the ‚ÄúCanale di Zaule‚Äù Free Area, are used for industrial activities. The port is articulated in various terminals, managed by private companies. ==History== In the period between the beginning of 1700 and 1850, Trieste was mainly an emporium and was given the status of Free Port by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in 1719. In 1740, when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria took power, one of the first measures she adopted was to extend the borders of the Free Port area to the periphery of the town, thereby merging the emporium, the port, the new city and the old one. The Empress decided to extend the exemptions from customs duties to the whole city, which attracted many people from different countries and all walks of life (Italians, Serbians, Slovenians, Croats, Jews and Greeks): for them a law was passed, the \\"Editto di tolleranza\\", which provided for the freedom of worship, the possibility to negotiate freely and to own goods. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Trieste Company (sometimes known as the \\"Austrian East India Company\\") attempted to connect directly the Habsburg Empire to the Indian and Chinese markets. It appeared that it was necessary to enlarge the port infrastructure and the railway network. In 1857 the S√ºdbahn (Southern) Railway line became operational along the northeastern route: Trieste, Postojna, Ljubljana, Graz, Vienna, with further links to Budapest and the Balkans. The railway element was central in the design of the port structures. In Trieste it was the Lagerh√§user system of Northern European ports that was used as a model. A French engineer, Paulin Talabot, designed the project. 1868 marks the beginning of Trieste as a commercial port whose infrastructures were to be developed in four different periods. To tackle the competition of Northern ports, which had been able to attract trade because of the lack of railway connections with Trieste, and to adjust to the needs of non-European maritime transport, which was to increase after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 - with the consequent shortening of the distance separating Trieste from Bombay by 7,500 miles - in 1868 the construction of the current Porto Vecchio (the Old Port, at the time called Porto Nuovo, the New Port) was started. The Northern part of the port was built between 1868 and 1883 together with the outer breakwater and other sea infrastructure. On December 22, 1871, the new monthly service linking Trieste with Bombay was established. In 1874 a contract was signed with the S√ºdbahn for the development of the port and in 1879 the Magazzini Generali (the warehouses) were erected. In the same year the Pontebbana railway line was officially opened connecting Trieste, Udine, Pontebba, Villach, Salzburg and Munich. In 1891 the port became a free port and was separated from the rest of the town by an enclosure. The status of free port, which had been previously extended to the whole city, was now being limited to this area, while the city became physically separated from it. In the period between 1901 and 1914 the works began to enlarge the Rive area (the embankment), to build the Bersaglieri Wharf, the Scalo Legnami (the timber pier) and S. Andrea port (piers V and VI). The fourth period, between 1924 and 1936, is characterised by the realisation of major public works, which were to complete the sea infrastructures, the port equipment on piers V and VI, the Silo, the Stazione Marittima (the passenger station), and the Idroscalo (the air harbour). After reconstructing the buildings damaged by the bombings of the Second World War, an innovative port reorganisation was started in line with the needs of the containerisation and the new transport systems. ==The Free Port== Under free port regulations goods reaching the port by land from Italy or the EU are considered definitively exported, and goods of foreign origin arriving by land are considered foreign goods in transit. Goods arriving from abroad by sea may transit freely and be sent to their foreign destinations. By virtue of exclusive regulations on customs credits, customs duties on goods destined for import may be paid after 6 months at reduced annual interest rates. The port's special extra-customs status also allows commercial operations to be carried out on goods deposited under the foreign regimen. Repackaging, labelling, industrial processing etc. are also possible under the same terms. Besides being the responsibility of the Port Authority (a publicly run body) management of the port's warehouses is also conducted by many private companies - forwarding companies or port terminal operators - working in complete autonomy within the Port Authority regulations. The status of the Free Port Zones has remained a distinctive feature of the Port of Trieste throughout its history. Granted in 1719 by the Habsburg Monarchy and restricted in 1891, this special status has been confirmed by subsequent peace treaties, by the European Community and by the Italian Parliament. Most port land is subject to this rule and therefore lies outside the jurisdiction of European Union Customs. Five Free Port Zones are defined as follows: * Old Free Zone * New Free Zone * Timber Terminal Free Zone * Mineral Oil Free Zone * Industrial Free Zone The Old Free Port, the most ancient complex of facilities, was designed by Paul Talabot and built between 1868 and 1883 according to a port and railway development plan aimed at consolidating the role of Trieste as a trading centre for all territories under Austro-Hungarian rule. A modern multipurpose terminal, the Adria Terminal, has recently been created alongside the older installations. The New Free Port is the result of a project begun in the early 20th century in response to the growth of trade with the Middle East and Far East created by the opening of the Suez Canal. Completed to a large extent in the 1920s and 1930s, it has been further extended since the 1960s with the development of a container terminal at Pier 7 and a ro-ro/ferry terminal at Riva Traiana. The remaining Free Zones include - in addition to the timber and oil terminals - part of the Zaule industrial canal, which serves the (EZIT) Industrial District, established after the Second World War. ==The Hydrodynamic Plant== The hydrodynamic plant, built in 1890, is an important piece of industrial archaeology. Together with Hamburg, Buenos Aires, Calcutta and Genoa, Trieste was one of the first ports in the world to be equipped with a hydrodynamic plant. The building is located behind the pier and is characterised by a high brick smokestack and two square towers at the sides of the main facade. The plant, which ceased to be used in 1983, took the water from the water system and supplied energy to the different points of consumption. It was, therefore, a centralised energy generator, which operated the quay cranes, the external cranes and the internal hoists of the port warehouses. A series of two-flue boilers, with a 2.10m diameter and a 10m length, built by St. Jashka & Sohn from Vienna, produced steam with a pressure of 7 atmospheres. The steam was delivered to four main machines and an auxiliary one, all manufactured by Maschinenbau Aktien Gesellschaft vormals Breitfeld, Danek & Com. Prag-Karolinenthal. The main machines had a higher motive part and a lower operating one. The motive part ‚Äì a double expansion steam engine ‚Äì had a central high-pressure cylinder with a 450 mm diameter and two lateral low-pressure cylinders of 600 mm diameter. A system of crankshaft rods ensured the correct timing of the three cylinders. Hydraulic pressure was kept constant by means of hydraulic accumulators. Two of them were located in the towers of the plant and one was situated in the tower near the port gates, in a more central position. Pressurised water was distributed along the port main axis through a 6.8 km long system of cast-iron pipes, installed in underground passages that could be inspected. The main pipeline branched out into secondary pipes connected to the individual points of consumption. In the years between 1920 and 1939 the plant operated 83 quay cranes, 31 external cranes for the warehouses and 57 hoists. The hydrodynamic plant - a rare example of machines that worked for more than a century - is located in a Rundbogenstil building, an architectural style that was a German version of Romanesque, very popular at the time. ==The Porto Vecchio== The link between city and port, tied together within a single process of urban and historical development, becomes evident in the Porto Vecchio area, with an architectural heritage of great historical and artistic value. Porto Vecchio, located in the heart of the city, covers an area of about 600,000 sq.m. and represents a jewel to be relaunched through the identification of new functions. The \\"capannoni\\", the oldest buildings of the port, were erected after the model of the Lagerh√§user, a word which refers to those parts of a city that are used for goods handling and include warehouses for the storage and stocking of goods, from their arrival in port to their shipment and distribution. The port system visually links Miramare Castle, Barcola and San Giusto Castle and follows three directions: a central one, connecting the port with the city, a second one, corresponding to the piers, and a third one, adjacent to the railway. The classification of warehouses and hangars (initially 38 main bodies) comprises three groups of buildings: * one-storey above-ground buildings * two or three-storey above-ground buildings, with cellars and garrets, with galleries that link the avant-corpses and are supported by cast- iron mullions * four-storey above-ground buildings, with cellars, ground floors and four higher floors with galleries The warehouses were initially equipped with cranes, elevators, hoists and other lifting equipment, which were used for goods loading and unloading and were hydraulically operated. The buildings of the first and second groups have a perron (a raised platform, about 1 meter high, used to perform loading and unloading operations with railway cars), while those of the third group, erected in more recent years (at the beginning of 1900), show entrance doors at ground level as well. The architectural features of these monumental buildings lie in the vertical and horizontal lines along the facades, in the geometric definition of the basements, the doors, the windows and all the elements of the architectonic language of this complex. Along the facade, the horizontal lines (the stringcourses, for instance) give the buildings a longitudinal appearance, while the vertical lines (pilaster strips and avant-corpses) create interruptions. Through the harmonisation of the lines, the structural elements take up an architectural character. The main body of the facades, from the base to the superstructure, shows unity and dimensional value. At the time of the construction, decorating was achieved through the use of different finishing materials and the work of master decorators and stone-dressers. Cornices, modillions, capitals, basements, windowsills and avant-corpses made of different materials produce a suggestive effect, which is enhanced by the materials' natural colours creating a uniform chromatic impression. Grey cast- iron mullions are a distinctive feature of hangars' ground floors. Each building is an example of the technical architecture at the end of the 19th century, a period of transition for the construction principles and configuration of maritime structures, which were adjusting to a defensive function and to the new trend of equipment mechanisation. ==Warehouse 26== Warehouse 26, a monumental building, covers an area of 9,000 sq.m., with a face of about 244m, an underground floor used as a cellar, a ground floor, three higher floors and a garret. It was completed in 1893. Because of the length of the building the design included two main stairs leading to the higher floors seven elevators, eight lifts and two internal hatchways connected with the cellar. The archivolt interrupts the monotonous shape of the windows, while the design of the main facade is consistent with the other buildings. The turrets above the finishing cornices, the richly decorated mansards and the clock tower enhance the sumptuousness of this warehouse. The rows of cast-iron mullions and the avant-corpses give the whole building an extraordinary perspective. ==See also== *Fincantieri *Italia Marittima *Diplomacy (game)#Basic setting and overview ==External links== *Official Site Trieste Category:Trieste Category:Transport in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Category:Buildings and structures in Trieste ","title":"Port of Trieste"},{"id":"9142796","text":"Foon Yew High School () is the largest Chinese independent high school in Malaysia.

Upon finishing, he tried several handicrafts until he discovered his talent in homespun tailoring. In the 1820s Zhelyazkov introduced an improved wool-carding machine in his work, drawing down upon himself the anger of his competitors, who complained to the authorities. However, this did not stop Zhelyazkov. In 1826, Zhelyazkov co-founded the Secret Brotherhood (–¢–∞–π–Ω–æ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ, Tayno bratstvo) together with Dr Ivan Seliminski. The organization, initially a social one, would develop into a political society. Following the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, Zhelyazkov took part in the organization of an uprising in the region of Sliven. However, after the signing of the Treaty of Adrianople in 1829, Zhelyazkov was forced to flee to Russia in 1830. He settled in Crimea, marrying another emigrant, Mariyka Yanakieva, and became a wool and cloth merchant, touring the country and observing textile production. Dobri Zhelyazkov's factory in Sliven as drawn by Felix Philipp Kanitz In 1834, Zhelyazkov returned to Sliven with his family and settled in his wife's house. There he constructed a production building (2.20 √ó 4.80 m, 3.80 m high), where he fitted looms, carding and spinning machines constructed by local smiths to designs brought from Russia. Zhelyazkov hired workers (including two Germans from Moravia) and began to produce homespun, frieze and broad cloth. While this once again angered his competitors, he also earned a number of admirers among the local citizens. To look for support for his work, Zhelyazkov went to Istanbul and met the Sultan Mahmud II, a known reformer. Mahmud was impressed by Zhelyazkov's production and, in 1835, signed a contract with him officially establishing the Sliven textile factory. A sultan's firman gave Zhelyazkov a number of rights, including the right to supply cloth for the Ottoman Army and administration. In the same time, the Ottoman government was obliged to provide Zhelyazkov with machines and another building, while Zhelyazkov's obligations included supplying wool, furnishing the factory, hiring and paying to workers and selling the produced cloth for the price of 22 groschen per arshin. Zhelyazkov's work is regarded as a historical achievement initiating the encouragement of local industry in the empire. The first to describe Zhelyazkov's factory was Ami Bou√© in 1837. In 1842, an expansion began, with another production building being constructed: one of the largest in Bulgaria during the period. In 1845, the factory became state property, and in 1853 Zhelyazkov's competitors libelled him and arranged his elimination from its administration. Zhelyazkov was sent to ƒ∞zmit in Anatolia, where he was supposed to set up another factory. Zhelyazkov returned to Sliven in 1856 and, despite his long legal efforts to regain his rights over the Sliven factory, he died ill and in poverty in 1865. ==References== * * Category:1800 births Category:1865 deaths Category:People from Sliven Category:19th-century Bulgarian businesspeople ","title":"Dobri Zhelyazkov"},{"id":"9142871","text":"Hi-Skool Trivia is the debut EP released by the band Emanuel Nice.

It borders several other villages including Gwersyllt and Gresford. At the 2001 Census, the total population of the community of Llay, including Llay village, was 4,905, reducing to 4,814 at the 2011 Census. Prior to the 1960s, Llay was a coal mining village. Llay Main Colliery, at one time the largest colliery in Wales and after 1952 the deepest pit in the UK, was a major employer for the area before its coal reserves were exhausted in 1966.Llay Main Colliery, BBC North East Wales ==History== Llay first appears in mediaeval records as a hamlet - a small settlement without a church - of the township and manor of Burton.Palmer, A. N. A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales and the Marches, 1910, p.232 It later formed an outlying part of the parish of Gresford, but the relatively late growth of the village is shown by the fact that the first church service was not held there until 1916, and its church was not completed until 1925.Llay, St Martin, GENUKI Llay was eventually made a separate parish in its own right in 1944. Much of the growth of the village is connected with the development of coal mines, particularly the Llay Main Colliery. It was first established by the industrialist Sir Arthur Markham in 1913, but sinking of the shafts was interrupted by the First World War and by Markham's death in 1916. The shafts were eventually completed in 1921, and coal production started in 1923. The colliery had a reputation as a well-run, modern pit with a relatively satisfied workforce, and by the 1930s was employing more than 3,000 men, 450 families being installed in new housing schemes in Llay. ==Today== There is a country park in Llay called Alyn Waters country park, which has a sister country park in Gwersyllt of the same name. The site includes a children's play park and pathways for pedestrian and cycle access through the forest. There were numerous original artworks around the park such as carved wooden animals along the paths, however many of the artworks have now been stolen or destroyed. There is a small golfing range at the park, and other sporting events take place on the large playing fields, such as football (home of Llay United Youth Football Club) and archery. There are four churches in the village of Llay; the Roman Catholic St. Francis of Assisi, Llay Community Church of the Nazarene, St. Martin of Tours of the Church in Wales and the Bethel Baptist Church. There are three drinking establishments, which are the Royal British Legion club, the Crown public house and Llay Miners' Welfare, also known as Miners' Welfare Institute. The Welfare had its grand opening in 1931 after negotiations in 1929 for monies to build a Miners' Institute with sports facilities. The Welfare was refurbished in 2005 after receiving a grant for the work. There is an industrial estate in Llay, being similar in size to the whole village itself, which it includes a Sharp Electronics factory. The Llay Resource Centre was opened in 2005 by Chris Armstrong., Minutes of Llay Community Committee 23/02/2005 The Resource Centre features a library, cafe, youth club and runs various courses and groups for the local community., llay.org ==Community groups== Park CP School Llay ‚Äì The infant and junior schools were merged in 2008 to form Park CP School Llay which provides education for children from the age of 3 to 11. Llay United Youth Football Club ‚Äì Is one of the largest community groups in Llay providing football for over 220 children. The club was started back in 1980 to provide local children organised football against other local teams. In 2011 the club was voted the Welsh FA Community Club of the Year. Llay Welfare Band - In the early days Llay Welfare Band was connected with Llay Main Colliery. In 1966 the colliery was closed which meant many players having to leave the area and thus the band. In 1967 the band had to be disbanded and all the instruments and equipment were given to the newly formed Point of Ayr Band. In the 1980s Gresford Band found themselves homeless when the N.U.M. office at Watery Road in Wrexham was closed. They were offered practice facilities at the Miners' Institute in Llay. The offer was accepted and Llay Welfare band was reborn. October 2012: Llay Welfare Band continues to practice at Llay Miners' Welfare. The band current members are drawn from surrounding communities, the band has one player who played for the original colliery band. The band has a developing junior section. ==Notable residents== *Chris Armstrong - former Wrexham, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and England B Team professional footballer, was brought up by his adoptive parents in the village after being born in Newcastle upon Tyne. *Terry Hennessey - former Welsh International professional footballer who played for Derby County in the 1970s. Now lives in Australia. *Mark Hughes - former Manchester City Manager and former Welsh International and Manchester United professional footballer, lived in the village until age four. *Steve O'Shaughnessy - former professional footballer who played for Leeds United, Bradford City, Rochdale and captained Darlington *Dennis Taylor - 1985 World Snooker Championship winner and BBC snooker commentator. ==References== ==External links== * Miner's Welfare's history on their official site * photos of Llay and surrounding area on geograph Category:Villages in Wrexham County Borough ","title":"Llay"},{"id":"9142949","text":"Jehudah Menachem Mendel \\"Mendy\\" Samstein (July 25, 1938 - January 24, 2007) was an American civil rights activist.

These are turn key race cars not designed for public road use. Each FR500 model is built with a unique Ford Racing number, and not a DOT VIN. Each is built when ordered through Ford Racing. Each FR500 is built by the same plant, in Flat Rock (Michigan), as the standard Mustang. Recently, Ford has announced that it will continue to offer the FR500 models in 2010. ==Concept (1999)== The concept vehicle was developed by Dan Davis and the Special Vehicles Team (SVT) at Ford Motor Company. It has top speed of 281.6 km/h (175.0 mph). The car was based on the 1999 SVT Cobra, but did have some changes compared to the base car. === Engine === The slightly larger than stock (4997 cc) engine was modified by a variable intake head, later available as an aftermarket part called the FR500 cylinder head. The exhaust was a special exhaust which kept the 2.5\\" diameter, but had a second crossover in the shape of an X-pipe behind the rear axle just before the exhaust tips. The mufflers had flaps, which opened under high pressure, thus making the exhaust more free flowing. The exhaust was also later sold as an aftermarket part by Ford Racing as the M-5230-M58 kit. Altogether, the engine modifications resulted in a horsepower increase to 415 from the stock 320 in the Cobra engine. === Drivetrain etc. === The FR500 concept came with a six-speed Tremec T56 transmission as compared to the 1999-standard T45 5 speed. Also, the wheelbase of the car was 5 inches larger than standard, which was due to the fact that the front axle had been moved forward by 5 inches. The car also had 14\\" Brembo brake discs with 4 piston calipers at the front end, Lincoln LS calipers with 13\\" rotors on the rear, and sported the so-called FR500 18\\" wheels, which also became available as an addon later. === Exterior === The FR500 had a special carbon fiber hood and front fascia. The hood was more aerodynamic than the standard Cobra/GT one, and did not feature an open hole between the lights. Instead, the air for cooling and the engine was taken from under the bumper. The car also came with special C-pillar covers, giving a sleeker appearance and changing the shape of the rear windows, close to the shape that was later resurrected for the 2001 Bullit Mustang. The longer wheelbase also mandated special carbon fiber fenders. Finally, as an aerodynamic touch, the side scoops were shaved. ==Road RacingFR500C=== Ford Mustang FR500C GT4 Powered by a 5.0L \\"Cammer R50\\" engine, it delivers . It includes a Tremec T56 6-speed transmission and other race-spec parts including a Grand Am-spec rollcage. It is permitted to be used in the Grand Am Grand Sport (GS) Class.Grand Am Rules & Regulations The FR500C can either be obtained as a turnkey costing $125,000 or by modding an existing Mustang GT with specified parts from Ford Racing. It is also known by its nickname \\"Boy Racer\\", assigned by Ford executives. This model won the manufacturers title in the Koni Challenge racing series in 2005 & 2008\\\\. This was after several attempts to slow the car down- such as a rearend gears change and additional weight. ===FR500S=== Powered by Ford's 4.6L V8 engine, it is rated at 325HP. The FR500S is often slotted in between the FR500C ('Boy Racer') and FR500GT ('Man Racer'). The car was designed by both Ford Racing and Miller Motorsports for the Ford Racing Mustang Challenge series (a racing series founded by Larry Miller). The car features similar aerodynamic parts like those used on the FR500GT, but uses a DOT approved racing tire- BFGoodrich g-Force R1. With the end of the Ford Racing Mustang Challenge, the FR500S has been homologated for competition in the SCCA World Challenge GTS class. ===FR500GT=== Codenamed Man Racer, the 5.0L V8 engine is rated at . This model features all of the features of a full race car, from heavily modified suspension to the large aerodynamic parts (which are effective). It also uses a 5.0L V8 engine built by Roush/Yates... ==Drag RacingFR500CJ=== The FR500CJ (Cobra Jet) was released in 2008, and was built to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of Ford winning NHRA Winternationals with 1968 Cobra Jet Mustang.

Bailey, a British army officer and explorer.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011. The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Thermophis baileyi, p. 14). ==Geographic range== T. baileyi is found only at high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau. The species is endemic to Tibet and has been recorded for the first time in 1907 by Wall near Gyantze at 4300 m asl (no exact coordinates available).Wall, Frank. Some new Asian snakes. Jour. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 1907, 17 (3): 612-618 In 1990 Macey and Papenfuss reported the species from Yangbajain hot spring area. So far T. baileyi is known only from a few sites.Zhao E.M. Thermophis baileyi. In: E.M. Zhao, et al. Fauna Sinica, Reptilia, vol. 3, Serpentes. Science Press, Beijing, 1998: 318-320. A comprehensive distribution map of T. baileyi is provided by Hofmann et al. (2014), showing that the geographic range of the snake is a restricted area between the Transhimalaya and the Himalaya, along the central part of the Yarlung Zhangbo suture zone. ==Description== Thermophis baileyi is olive green, with five series of indistinct spots dorsally, most pronounced in the forebody. It has a dusky postocular streak, and dusky posterior edges to the labials. The belly is bluish-grey, with each ventral black basally. The young are darker than adults. Dorsal scales in 19 rows at midbody, all keeled except last row, with indistinct double apical facets. Ventrals 201-221; anal divided; subcaudals 91-111, mostly divided, but with a few entire. Adults may attain a total length (body + tail) of 2 feet 6 inches (76 cm). ==Conservation status== Bailey's snake is considered Near Threatened by IUCN. In the last decades, the growing exploitation of geothermal energy has led to a destruction of hot spring habitats, resulting in an increased threat to populations of hot-spring snakes. ==Taxonomy== The existence of Bailey's snake was first announced in the scientific literature in 1907, when it was described as a new species by Frank Wall. Wall originally classified it as Tropodinotus (=Natrix) baileyi, before it was realized that Bailey's snake did not fit in the genus Natrix. In 1953 Malnate placed it in the new genus Thermophis, designating baileyi as the type species. ==Habitat== This genus of snakes lives probably at the highest altitude of any snake in the world. Presence of T. baileyi is strongly attributable to hot springs with low sulphur concentration, locations in river valleys that provide rocky slopes and vegetated shorelines and existence of a river within a 500 m radius. ==References== ==External links== * Hot spring snakes at Life is Short but Snakes are Long Category:Colubrids Category:Snakes of China Category:Endemic fauna of Tibet Category:Reptiles described in 1907 Category:Taxa named by Frank Wall ","title":"Thermophis baileyi"},{"id":"9143171","text":"Michael William Hegman (born January 17, 1953) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at Tennessee State University. ==Early years== Hegman did not start playing football until his senior year at Northside High School in Memphis. He began his college career at Alabama A&M; University and then transferred to Tennessee State University, where he walked on to the football team. He was a teammate of Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones, and the starting middle linebacker on the school's 10-0 team, that won the Black college football national championship in 1973. The next year, he finished with a school record 158 tackles. At the end of his junior season, it was incorrectly believed that Hegman still had a year of eligibility. The Dallas Cowboys were thought to be one of the only NFL teams that knew he was eligible for the draft, and drafted him in what came to be known as the Dirty Dozen Draft in 1975. Two games into the 1975 college football season, the NCAA declared him ineligible and forced him to sit our the rest of the games. Although he sat out most of the year, he was allowed to play in the Senior Bowl. ==Professional career== The Dallas Cowboys selected him as a junior in the seventh round (173rd overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft. The team was allowed to retain his rights, after they were proven right that he was technically eligibile, because his class had graduated that year. After his unusual entrance into the NFL in 1976, he spent most of his first four seasons playing special teams and as an outside linebacker backup to Thomas \\"Hollywood\\" Henderson and D. D. Lewis. During Super Bowl XIII against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he made his most famous play, taking the ball from Terry Bradshaw and scoring on a 37-yard fumble return for a touchdown. Hegman became the starting strong-side linebacker after the team waived Henderson 11 games into the 1979 season. In 1985, he lost five games with a broken arm. In 1987, he missed 6 games with a broken leg. In 1988, he suffered cartilage tear in his right knee during the preseason and was placed on the injured reserve list. He was released as part of a youth movement on October 25. Hegman played 12 years and started in 116 games, becoming a dependable player in the Cowboys defense for more than a decade. He helped the Cowboys win 2 NFC Championships and 1 Super Bowl during his career. ==Personal life== During the 1980 offseason, he faced prosecution on a charge of forging a friend's name on $10,534 worth of checks. The case was dismissed after he paid the money he owed, with the help of players like Cliff Harris, Roger Staubach, Bob Breunig and Tony Dorsett, who gave $2,000 dollars each to help cover the debt. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:African-American players of American football Category:Players of American football from Tennessee Category:American football linebackers Category:American football outside linebackers Category:Alabama A&M; Bulldogs football players Category:Tennessee State Tigers football players Category:Sportspeople from Memphis, Tennessee Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Mike Hegman"},{"id":"9143179","text":"Henry Meysey Meysey-Thompson, 1st Baron Knaresborough (30 August 1845 ‚Äì 3 March 1929) was a Liberal (and later Liberal Unionist) politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1880 and 1905 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Knaresborough. ==Early life== Meysey-Thompson was born at Kirby Hall, near Great Ouseburn, North Yorkshire, the son of Sir Harry Meysey- Thompson, 1st Baronet and his wife Elizabeth Anne Croft, daughter of Sir John Croft, 1st Baronet.

It helps those who have any kind of sensory impairment or communication difficulties. It can also help those who have tactile defensiveness, profound and multiple learning difficulties, autism, Down syndrome, and dementia . Tacpac uses specially composed music that matches the texture of the object for each activity so that those who are receiving Tacpac have an aligned experience. Over time, users can employ this to help them communicate. Tacpac comes in the form of a subscription which is accessed both on the website and also on the app for phones and tablets. The resources include the full music tracks, instruction videos for each activity, and downloadable/printable records that keep sheets and instruction sheets. The app enables users to play full music tracks without an internet connection. Through repetition of activities in the Tacpac repertoire, a receiver learns to show responses that can be understood: e.g., those manifesting like/dislike; want/rejection; and know/nescient. Users can begin to move in response to stimuli, anticipate activities, and relate to the helper. These primal responses that comprise pre-intentional and affective communication can be crucial steps toward more clearly defined intentional communication and even language acquisition . As one researcher writes: \\"One of the most effective ways of establishing contact with deafblind children and so encouraging a communicative response is to share activities with a high levels of physical contact and pleasant sensations. These include [...] Tacpac, a package where taped music is linked to a range of tactile sensations.\\" The number of research projects around Tacpac is growing. It has found support from the Royal National Institute of Blind People in the UK, and has growing followers amongst multi-sensory impairment networks. ==References== # Laura Pease (2000) 'Creating a communicating environment', in Teaching Children who are Deafblind: Contact, Communication and Learning, David Fulton Publishers, London # 'Let the fun begin!

He played college football at the University of Wyoming and was drafted in the first round of the 1976 NFL Draft. ==Early years== After graduating from Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Michigan in 1971, he accepted a football scholarship from the University of Wyoming. Kyle played strong safety and returned punts during his first three years. As a senior, he was switched to cornerback and was used on either side of the field. He received All-WAC honors, played in the 1975 Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic, the Senior Bowl and the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. He was the team's best defensive player in his last two years and left as the school's career leader in tackles (275). In 2016, he was inducted into the Wyoming Athletics Hall of Fame. ==Professional careerDallas Cowboys=== In the 1976 NFL Draft, he became only the second Wyoming player ever to be drafted to the NFL in the first round and the first defensive back ever to be selected by the Dallas Cowboys that high. As a rookie, he was the backup at left cornerback behind Benny Barnes and was used on passing downs to primarily cover the running backs. He became a core special teams player, registering 2 blocked punts. By the start of his second year he replaced hall of famer Mel Renfro in the starting lineup at right cornerback. He missed the last four games of that season (1977), because of a fractured left wrist he suffered in a 34-16 win over the Washington Redskins in the fifth game. He returned for the playoffs to help the team win Super Bowl XII, recording three tackles, an interception, a tackle on a run from a punt attempt and a fumble recovery that set up the game-clinching touchdown. In 1978, he started all 16 games at cornerback, while making 3 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries (tied for the team lead). He also had an interception in the playoffs against the Atlanta Falcons. In Super Bowl XIII, he missed a tackle that allowed John Stallworth to have a 75-yard touchdown play. In 1979, although he started 16 games, he was limited by bone spurs in his left knee that he developed during training camp. He intercepted two passes in the season opener against the St. Louis Cardinals. In May 1980 season, he had knee surgery to remove the bone spurs, which led the team to place him in the injured reserve list. Once the season started, the Cowboys tried to recall him from the injured reserve list, but because they used the procedural recall system to waive him, he was able to be declared as a free agent. ===Denver Broncos=== On October 14, 1980, he signed as a free-agent with the Denver Broncos, playing in 10 games (9 starts) and recording 72 tackles. Kyle played a total of 3 seasons in Denver, starting at right cornerback, while leading the team in turnovers in both 1981 and 1982, with a total of 5 interceptions and 7 fumble recoveries. In 1981, he registered 68 tackles. He retired on April 16, 1983, after being the Broncos player representative during that season's strike. ==References== ==External links== *Wyoming Athletics Hall of Fame bio Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:American football cornerbacks Category:Cass Technical High School alumni Category:Wyoming Cowboys football players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Aaron Kyle"},{"id":"9143260","text":"The Chandongcha Sports Club () is a North Korean football club based in Chongjin, North Hamgyong.

She is the main protagonist of the Medieval Icelandic Laxd≈ìla saga, which recounts the history of the People of Lax√°rdalur. It is widely thought that the saga represents some historical fact. ==Background== Gu√∞r√∫n was the daughter of √ìsv√≠fr Helgason and √û√≥rd√≠s √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfsd√≥ttir. She grew up at Laugar in S√¶lingsdal. Her future marriages were foretold when she relayed four dreams, each represented one of her marriages to come. There exists a thermal bath called Gu√∞r√∫narlaug reportedly at the site where the dreams were interpreted by Gestur Oddleifsson. ===First marriage=== Her first marriage to Thorvaldr Halldorsson ended in divorce. It was a brief unhappy marriage, however after the divorce she acquired half of his estate. Laxd≈ìla saga chapter XXXIV ===Second marriage=== Her second husband Thord Ingunnarsson drowned at sea. She gave birth to his son soon after, naming him Thord. Laxd≈ìla saga chapter XXXV ===Third marriage=== After her second husband's death she was courted by the two foster-brothers Kjartan √ìl√°fsson and Bolli √ûorleiksson. Gu√∞r√∫n preferred Kjartan, but she gave herself to Bolli, because of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged to Ingibj√∂rg, the sister of King √ìl√°fr Tryggvason. The two foster- brothers engaged in hostilities which ended with Bolli killing Kjartan, and Bolli being killed by Kjartan's kinsmen. Her second son, Bolli Bollason, was born the winter after the killing of his father when her son Thord was only four. They grew up at Helgafell, after his mother Gu√∞r√∫n exchanged homes with chieftain Snorre Torgrimsson (Snorri Go√∞i).Laxd≈ìla saga chapter LVI ===Fourth marriage=== In 1020, Gu√∞r√∫n married for the fourth time, this time to Thorkell Eyjolffsson, who became a great chieftain in his own countryside and took over the running of the household at Helgafell. Thorkell was fond of both his stepsons, but Bolli was regarded as \\"being the foremost in all things\\".Laxd≈ìla saga chapter LXX Thorleik journeyed abroad to Norway, and stayed with King Olaf Haraldsson for several months. Gu√∞r√∫n constantly argued for revenge for the killing of her former husband Bolli √ûorleiksson, but eventually her two sons made peace with the sons of √ìl√°fr, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the Thorness Thing; it is not known how much money was exchanged in compensation as part of the agreement, but \\"both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs\\".Laxd≈ìla saga chapter LXXI To get Thorgils to help her have revenge she promised to marry no other man in the country, nor to marry abroad. When he returns successful she tells him that she is to marry Thorkel since he technically meets the requirements of their promise. He was not in the country at the time, and they would not be marrying abroad. Thorgils was not very happy about this turn of events. Her father, √ìsv√≠fr Helgason died soon after the marriage, and he was buried at a church Gu√∞r√∫n constructed. ===Widowhood=== The day Thorkell drowned at sea, Gu√∞r√∫n saw the ghost of him and his companions standing outside the church. They vanished but left a strong impression on her, she became the first Icelandic woman to learn the Psalter. Her granddaughter Herdis often accompanied her on her nightly prayer excursions. One night Herdis had a dream that led them to a discovery of a prophetess buried beneath Gu√∞r√∫n's prayer spot. Her son Bolli asked permission to marry Thordis, the daughter of Snorri Go√∞i. Gu√∞r√∫n approved of the union. In her old age Gu√∞r√∫n was asked by her son Bolli which of the men in her life she loved most. She gave the cryptic response \\"To him I was worst whom I loved best,\\"Laxd≈ìla saga chapter LXXVIII which answer, though accepted by her son, has sparked great debate among scholars as to whom she was referring. Gu√∞r√∫n died and was buried at Helgafell. ==References== ==Other sources== *Vidar Hreinsson (1997) The Complete Sagas of Icelanders (Reykjavik: Leifur Eiriksson Publishing Ltd.) ==External links== *Translation in English by Muriel Press (The Temple Classics, London, 1899) *Text with modern Icelandic spelling *Laxd√¶la saga in an English translation by Muriel A.

His parents condoned his jazz drumming as long as he continued his piano lessons. Pursuing a career in jazz, he met Manfred Mann while working as a musician at Butlin's Clacton, and they formed a seven-piece group. The Mann-Hugg Blues Brothers recruited Paul Jones and later Tom McGuinness.Interview . Retrosellers.com. Retrieved 27 August 2011. On signing with HMV Records their producer, John Burgess, changed their name to Manfred Mann. Hugg is a competent pianist and an able vibraphone player, but his main role in Manfred Mann was as drummer. However, he recorded several vibraphone solos with the band (e.g. \\"I'm your Kingpin\\") and used the instrument to augment hits such as \\"Oh No Not My Baby\\". He was credited as co- writer of the group's early hits and contributed solo compositions throughout its life, including jazzy instrumentals (\\"Bare Hugg\\") and wistful acid-pop (\\"Funniest Gig\\", \\"Harry the One Man Band\\"). His abilities as a songwriter grew throughout the group's career,Manfred Mann. Starling.rinet.ru.

Said the Clown\\", in an interview with Melody Maker as one of the five worst records he had ever heard. He and his brother composed \\"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\\" which was recorded by the Yardbirds in 1965. Hugg also composed the majority of the songs for the 1968 Paramount film Up the Junction.Eder, Bruce. (11 August 1942) Mike Hugg. AllMusic. Retrieved 27 August 2011. By this time Hugg was already branching out into film and television composition. After composing for Up The Junction, he wrote incidental music to a BBC Wednesday Play, and contributed to the score for the Jes√∫s Franco film Venus in Furs in 1969, together with Manfred Mann. He co-wrote the theme music to the BBC TV comedy series Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads in 1972, followed by the score to the 1976 feature film. Between 1967 & 1968 Hugg helped write & produce songs for The Cherry Smash, a group that included his brother Bryan Sebastian, along with Mick Gill, John Curtis, Graham Hunt, and Mark Tuddenham. Their singles were: 1967 - Sing Songs of Love/Movie Star (on the Track label) 1968 - Goodtime Sunshine/Little Old Country Home Town (on the Decca label) 1968 - Fade Away Maureen/Green Plant (on the Decca label) When he and Manfred Mann formed the more progressive Manfred Mann Chapter Three, taking inspiration from Doctor John and free jazz and touring with a five-piece brass section, Hugg moved to electric piano and lead vocals. He took the latter role, by his own account, purely because no-one better was available. One of its themes was used as the soundtrack of a TV advertisement for cigars.

The park encompasses and features a monument commemorating the August 19, 1782 Battle of Blue Licks. The battle was regarded as the final battle of the American Revolutionary War. Monument at the Blue Licks Battlefield ==History== The earliest accounts of Blue Licks describe it as a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795‚Äì97 diary: > As you approach the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you > begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of > the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks, forsaken of the earth that once > covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing > size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here > immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, > scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.Ohio > Archaeology and History Society Publications 16: 348‚Äì401. In 1782, British Captain William Caldwell led a force of Indians against the small Kentucky settlement of Bryan's Station. Caldwell met stiff resistance, and after two days, retreated toward the Ohio River. The pioneers ‚Äì Daniel Boone among them ‚Äì were inclined to wait for reinforcements before pursuing the enemy, and although under the general leadership of Major John Todd, Major Hugh McGary of the Lincoln County contingent made a brash and fateful decision to pursue immediately (after an insult for being timid from Todd), engaging Caldwell at Blue Licks. In the battle that followed, 60 of the 176 men who followed McGary were killed, Boone's son Israel among them. Another 7 were captured. The survivors fled back to Bryan's Station and Lexington. Reinforcements under [Benjamin Logan] eventually arrived and buried the dead militiamen. By the mid-19th century, the Blue Licks area had become a health resort, due in large part to the nearby saltwater springs that had been used for \\"salt making\\" since the 1770s. The mineral water found in the springs was rumored to cure everything from asthma to gout. By 1896, however, the area's last spring had gone dry. Efforts to locate another spring unearthed several geological and historical artifacts. A more extensive excavation of the area was conducted in 1945. The battlefield was once on the National Register of Historic Places, but the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program determined in the 1990s that the site's integrity was too destroyed, causing the removal of the battlefield from the Register. However, a team from Morehead State University is to search the battlefield using modern equipment to explore for artifacts relating to the battlefields. Enough success in this endeavor could mean the return of the battlefield to the Register. ==Activities and amenities== The park is located along the Licking River, and offers canoeing and fishing. The Licking River Trail offers a one-mile (1.6 km) hike along the riverbank. Overnight stays are accommodated at the 32-room lodge or the 51-site campground. ===State Nature Preserve=== The park also features a nature preserve containing a cedar glade, managed by the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves. This glade was previously maintained as an open area by the large numbers of herbivores, such as bison, elk, and woolly mammoths who frequented the area. Today much of the glade has transitioned into forest, but the remnant areas are being maintained by controlled burns and removal of Eastern redcedar. These remnants are home to the federally endangered Short's goldenrod and the state threatened Great Plains Ladies'-tresses. ===Pioneer Museum=== The Pioneer Museum is the park's major attraction. It houses a variety of artifacts, from a mastodon tooth found during an excavation of the site to relics from the American Civil War. Exhibits focus on the area's natural and cultural history, including prehistoric animals and fossils, area Native Americans and 18th century pioneers, as well as a diorama of the battle. The museum was dedicated in 1931, saw renovations completed in 2007, and was closed for restoration as of 2014. ===Events=== The Battle of Blue Licks celebration is held annually in mid-August and features a re-enactment of the Battle of Blue Licks. The Short's Goldenrod Festival‚Äîa celebration of one of the rarest plants in Kentucky and the United States‚Äîsaw its 30th anniversary in 2006.

The station is licensed to Brookville, Pennsylvania, where it maintains its transmitter facility, but the station's programming and administration functions originate in Punxsutawney, where it shares studio space with its affiliate stations WPXZ and WECZ. Since signing on the air for the first time in February 2000, this station had used the call letters WYTR, but had always maintained an oldies format, through ABC/SMN's Classic Hits (formerly \\"Oldies Radio\\") music format. At the time of its initial sign on, the station had very briefly used the call letters WBEU. Another set of call letters, WBKV (for Brookville), were proposed but never used. WKQL \\"Kool 103.3\\" serves Clarion, Clearfield, Elk, Forest, Indiana, Jefferson, and Cambria counties. The station is owned and operated by Renda Radio, Inc. The station added a local website (oldiesradioonline.com is ABC/SMN's site) http://www.kool1033fm.com/ in September 2007. ==History== The groundwork for WKQL was laid in the mid 1990s, when Anthony F. Renda, president of Renda Broadcasting Corporation, wanted to put a new radio station on the air that would also, in part, serve his hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania. Through a series of engineering maneuvers, Renda learned that 103.3 could go on the air with a powerful regional signal if some signal shuffling among other FM's in northwest Pennsylvania occurred. This affected stations in his hometown of Indiana, his co-owned property in neighboring Punxsutawney, and competing stations in St. Mary's, Brookville, Barnesboro, Emporium, Reynoldsville and Clearfield. It took some time for the maneuvers to occur, but all of them were complete within four years. A new tower was built on a massive hillside on the outskirts of Brookville. There were many construction delays because of poor access, no electricity was available in the area, and unable to afford the station remaining silent any longer, Kool 103.3 finally went on the air in February 2000, using a gasoline- powered generator to provide electricity to the station's transmitter. The station finally had hard-wired electricity at the transmitter site less than six months later. WKQL, though licensed to Brookville, converted former newsroom studio space for its sister stations in Punxsutawney to that of a permanent live on-air studio. ==WKQL today== WKQL continues as KOOL 103.3, playing classic hits, and is also the radio home of Brookville Raiders football and basketball play-by-play broadcasts. WKQL is also an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey network.

One of these is a poem in the Poetic Edda named Atlakvi√∞a: {  :Sjau eigum vit salh√∫s :sver√∞a full, :hverju eru √æeira :hj√∂lt √≥r gulli; :minn veit ek mar beztan, :en m√¶ki hvassastan, :boga bekks√¶ma, :en brynjur √≥r gulli, :hjalm ok skj√∂ld hv√≠tastan :kominn √≥r h√∂ll K√≠ars, :einn er minn betri :en s√© allra H√∫na.Atlakvi√∞a, at ¬´Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad¬ª, Norway.  :Seven halls we have :Fulfilled of swords, :And hilts of gold :Each sword there has; :My horse is the best, :My blade is the keenest; :Fair my bow o'er the bench is, :Gleams my byrny with gold; :Brightest helm, brightest shield, :From Kiar's dwelling ere brought -- :Better all things I have :Than all things of the Huns.The Lay of Atli Translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson.  } Of old, they say, Humli (to the left raising his hand) over Huns did rule, Gizur (in the foreground, challenging the Huns) the Gauts... The second reference is in the Hervarar saga which contains a reference to K√≠arr in a poem in fornyr√∞islag which lists the great kings of old: {  :√År kva√∞ Humla :H√∫num r√°√∞a, :Gizur Gautum, :Gotum Angant√Ω, :Valdarr D«´num :en V«´lum K√≠arr, :Alrekr enn fr√¶kni :enskri √æj√≥√∞u.The Poem Hei√∞r 89 at the database \\"Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages\\".  :Of old, they say, Humli :over Huns did rule, :Gizur the Gauts, :the Goths Angantyr, :Valdar the Danes, :the Romans Kjar, :Alrek the Valiant :the English people.  } The few appearances of Kj√°rr stand out from the general lack of references to the Romans in the literary sources of the Germanic peoples before the arrival of Christianity.Anderson, Carl Edlund.

Ph.D. thesis, University of Cambridge, Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse & Celtic (Faculty of English). p. 45. ==Etymology== Many scholars have suggested that the name is derived from Caesar, but the route it took to Scandinavia is not clear. It may have been transmitted through a West Germanic language, but since Scandinavia and the Goths had close connections, it may also have been borrowed from the Gothic language and ultimately from Greek. The evolution of the name would have been Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÉŒ±œÅ ‚Üí kaisar ‚Üí *kƒìsar ‚Üí K√≠arr ‚Üí Ki√°rr. A third possibility is that it originates from contacts with Rome beside the probably early borrowing R√∫m in words such as R√∫mverjar (\\"Roman soldiers\\").

In the middle of the valley the river passes through the village of Obernberg am Brenner. It discharges into the Sill at Gries am Brenner. From the spring to the junction with the Sill it falls more than in a V-shaped valley. It provides the village with drinking water thanks to its Grade A quality.

In the earlier part of his life he went by the name John Wiche. ==Life== He was the second son of William Wakeman of Drayton, Worcestershire. He supplicated in the name of John Wyche, for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity on 3 February 1511. On 19 March 1534 a cong√© d'√©lire was issued for the election of an abbot of the Benedictine monastery of Tewkesbury to replace Henry Beeley, deceased. On 27 April 1534 the royal assent was given to the election of John Wiche, late prior, as abbot. The temporalities were restored on 10 June. Wiche had secured his own appointment by intrigue, obtaining the interest of Sir William Kingston and of Thomas Cromwell, and by then persuading his brethren to refer the election to the king's pleasure. At the end of July 1535 both Cromwell and the king were staying at the monastery, and in October Wiche sent Cromwell a gelding and ¬£5 to buy him a saddle. He supplied information to the government on the disaffection of one of his priors. On 9 January 1539 he surrendered his monastery, receiving an annuity of four hundred marks. He then seems to have taken the name Wakeman, by which he was afterwards known. On his nomination to the newly erected see of Gloucester in September 1541 this pension was vacated. The date of the letters patent for the erection of the bishopric is 3 September 1541. Wakeman was consecrated by Thomas Cranmer, Edmund Bonner, and Thomas Thirlby at Croydon in September 1541. In 1547 he attended the funeral of Henry VIII, and on 19 February of the same year assisted at the consecration of Arthur Bulkeley as bishop of Bangor. Wakeman must have had some pretensions to scholarship and theology. In 1542, when Cranmer was projecting a revision of the translation of the New Testament, he assigned the Revelation to Wakeman, with John Chambers, bishop of Peterborough, as his colleague. Wakeman died early in December 1549. His place of burial is Gloucester Cathedral. While abbot of Tewkesbury, Wakeman constructed a cadaver tomb cenotaph in Tewkesbury Abbey, on the north-east side of the high altar, which is still to be seen. His nephew Richard was great-grandfather of Sir George Wakeman. ==References== * Category:1549 deaths Category:English Benedictines Category:Abbots of Tewkesbury Category:Bishops of Gloucester Category:16th-century English bishops Category:People associated with the Dissolution of the Monasteries Category:Year of birth missing Category:People from Worcestershire Category:Burials at Gloucester Cathedral ","title":"John Wakeman"},{"id":"9143553","text":"Yoel Aloni (; September 30, 1937 ‚Äì September 9, 2019) was an Israeli chess master and problemist.Chess problemists Topics He was the twin brother of Hillel Aloni (1937-2017).

Rice is parboiled before flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. The thickness of the flakes varies between almost translucently thin (the more expensive varieties) to nearly four times thinner than a normal rice grain. It is also called \\"beaten rice\\", not to be confused with poha, a Central-West Indian dish prepared using this flattened rice as the key ingredient. This easily digestible form of raw rice is very popular across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, and is normally used to prepare snacks or light and easy fast food in a variety of Indian cuisine styles, some even for long-term consumption of a week or more.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Stari Grad. In the Classical Antiquity, area of the modern square was the center of Singidunum, Roman precursor of modern Belgrade. == Location == Studentski Trg is located halfway between the Republic Square (to the east) and the Kalemegdan park-fortress (to the west). It is adjacent to the Academy Park. To the north it extends into the neighborhood of (Upper) Dorƒáol, while the pedestrian zone of Knez Mihailova is located to the south. == History  Roman period === Predecessor of Belgrade was Singidunum, Celtic and, later, Roman fortified town. The original earthen and wooden fort stretched around the Studentski Trg and Knez Mihailova Street. The oldest Roman graves were discovered in this section, dated to the 1st and early 2nd century. The central axis of the city grid was in the modern Uzun Mirkova-Studentski Trg-Vasina-Republic Square direction, thus the area od modern square was the \\"heart\\" of ancient Singidunum. Part of the main axis was an additional turning at modern Rajiƒáeva Street. There was a gate at the entrance into the military camp. The gate was located where the City Library, the last building in the Knez Mihailova Street before the Kalemegdan Park, is located today. Northern section of the Academy Park was excavated in 1968 in the project of building a furnace oil tank for the boiler room of the Belgrade's City Committee of the League of Communists located nearby. Under the lawn, the remnants of the ancient Roman thermae were discovered, including the frigidarium (room with the cold water), laconicum (room with the warm water), caldarium (room with the two pools of hot water) and tepidarium (room where people would sweat and prepare). The site became an archaeological dig in 1969 and 8 rooms in total were discovered, including the remains of the brick furnace which heated the water. Despite the military character of Singidunum, it was a public unisex bath. It is dated to 3rd or 4th century. Almost the entire building was unearthed, covering with walls being preserved up to the height of . The building had the system of floor and wall heating, made of special, hollow bricks which allowed for the hot air to circulate through the rooms (tegula mammata and tubula). The canals which conducted the water to the thermae, and were discovered in 2013 when the manhole was dug in front of the Ethnographic Museum. The canals were connected to the main aqueduct built by the Romans, which conducted water from the springs in modern Mali Mokri Lug. The thermae was built by the Roman military, as attested by the inscriptions on the bricks which contain markings of the Legio IV Flavia Felix. The entire area of the park is actually within the borders of the \\"Protected zone of Roman Singidunum\\". It is situated in the area that used to be the civilian sector of the city, outside the fortress. The remnants were visible until 1978 and due to the lack of funds to continue excavations or to cover it with the roof or a marquee, the remains were conserved and buried again. There are remains of another thermae, at the nearby Faculty of Philosophy Plateau. They are still visible and are used as benches. In general, the entire surrounding area is rich in Roman remains from the 1st to the 3rd century AD. They also include remains below modern Faculty of Philosophy, hotel Square 9 (locality Studentsi trg 9) and Ethnographic Museum (canals in front of the entrance in the museum). Below the roundabout are extremely well preserved walls, surrounded by the intact Roman floors and barriers. This section was discovered in 1989, but wasn't archaeologically surveyed. Some of the oldest remains are those discovered under the faculty building. They are dated to c.100 and were still made of wattle and lep, a wall plaster made of mud. Apart from the thermae, there are also remains of a large building, with three apses and floor heating system. === Ottoman period === During the Ottoman period, the area was occupied by the Turkish cemetery, mezarlƒ±k. The cemetery stretched to the modern streets of Knez Mihailova and Zmaj Jovina. Numerous remains from this period were discovered since the 1950s, during the various communal works conducted on the square and the surrounding areas. === Great Market === At the place of the modern square, there was an open green marketplace for over a century. At the beginning of the 19th century, farmers were selling goods at the entrances to the city. However, Turkish soldiers would often forcibly buy goods from them at the small prices, and then sell it themselves in the city for much higher amounts. After constant complaints from the farmers, vizier of Belgrade, after counseling with the city merchants, agreed to choose one place for the market: da se uƒçini u Beogradu jedno pazari≈°te ili Tor≈æi≈°te (\\"a bazar or a marketplace is to be founded in Belgrade\\"). Also, in 1821, the state government decided to put the food trade in order and to establish the quantity and quality of the goods imported to the city. Part of the project was introduction of the excise on the goods (in Serbian called tro≈°arina) and setting of a series of excise check points on the roads leading to the city. That same year, the city's first proper greenmarket became operational. Originally, it opened in 1824 right across the Belgrade Fortress, in the modern Pariska street, stretching between the Uzun Mirkova and Knez Mihailova streets, where the City Library is today. Only 4 days later, it was moved to the location above the old, defunct Turkish cemetery. The chosen location was situated above the Tekija building and the Kizlar Aga's Mosque, close to the starting section of the Tsarigrad Road. The market was soon equipped with market stalls for selling fruits and vegetables and barracks for the dairy products, eggs and dried meat. Raw meat was not allowed at the market. Poultry was sold alive and only in pairs. Other meat was prepared and sold in butcher shops and, since there were no refrigerators, had to be sold by noon. Apart from being the first arranged and planned market in the city, it also was the first to have a sanitary inspection which checked the hygiene, quality and freshness of the goods. As per Serbian-Turkish agreement anyone could bring and sell goods, the market quickly grew and became city's commercial center. Though it was officially named \\"Saint Andrew's Market\\" it became known as the Great Market (Serbian: Velika pijaca or Veliki pijac). === Formation of the square === The square developed around the market, also occupying parts of the former Turkish graveyard. It was originally called Veliki trg (\\"Great Square\\"). As the ceremony of proclamation of Serbia into the kingdom in 1882 was held here, the square was renamed to Kraljev trg (\\"King's Square\\"). In 1863 the Captain Mi≈°a's Mansion was built and the Great School moved in. In the direction of Kalemegdan, municipal administration of Belgrade was located and the building was later used for the municipal court. Later city administration building was also located here, just on the northern side. At the corner with the Zmaja od Noƒáaja Street, the fire brigade was situated. They used the lookout on the top of the Captain Mi≈°a's Mansion to inspect the city. As the city had no tall buildings at the time, the guard from the lookout was able to pinpoint a specific house anywhere in the city if the fire broke out. He would then alarm his colleagues below using a trumpet. In the kafana Kod Rajiƒáa junaka serbskog, prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá organized festivities after he was handed over the keys to the city from the Ottomans, who had to evacuate the Belgrade Fortress. Prince Mihailo was assassinated on 10 June 1868. The Board for the erection of the monument was formed already on 14 June 1868 and decided to collect donations for the construction of both the church in Ko≈°utnjak, at the assassination location, and a monumental sculpture in the city itself. Russian sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin, after arriving in Belgrade in October 1868, and inspecting the city, in cooperation with the government and the Board, proposed two designs for the monument to the prince, which was to be erected at the Great Market. After the public display, the citizens apparently liked the designs and approved the building. However, the process of building the memorial dragged on, and in 1871 Mikeshin's propositions were rejected. Also in 1871, the government opted to build only the monument in the city. It announced the international design competition but dissatisfied with the results, the government repeated the competition in 1873. This time, the location for the monument was set at the Theatre Square (modern Republic Square), across the National Theatre in Belgrade, which was built by prince Michael. Its were the Prince Mihailo Monument was ultimately built in 1882. First modern Belgrade's urbanist Emilijan Josimoviƒá suggested dislocation of the market in 1887, as it was placed in the sole center of the city. Plus, he deemed it inappropriate for the Great School to be across the market. But when the horse-drawn tram was introduced in Belgrade 1892, and it passed through this part of the city, the market actually bloomed even more. Josimoviƒá met with lots of resistance and only some time before his death, he managed for the city to decide to split the market in two and to form a park in one of the sections. The open space area around the market, which was now a defunct Turkish cemetery, and the northwestern section were turned into the park, as Josimoviƒá originally envisioned. He also proposed for the nearby buffer zone between the city and the Fortress to be adapted into the Kalemegdan Park, as he considered parks the \\"air reservoirs\\". The park was opened on 11 May 1897, just two weeks before Josimoviƒá's death. On the same day, the monument to Josif Panƒçiƒá, work of sculptor ƒêorƒëe Jovanoviƒá was erected in the park. As the monument was covered with cloth for a long time, citizens colloquially nicknamed the square a \\"plateau of the bagged man\\". The market itself continued to operate until 1926 when was finally closed. With the closing of the Great Market, city government built several other markets in the city, bit further from the downtown: Zeleni Venac, Kaleniƒá market, Bajloni market and Jovanova market. The park that was created was named Panƒçiƒáev Park, after his monument in the park, and is today known as the Akademski Park. Panƒçiƒá's monument was coupled with the monument dedicated to Dositej Obradoviƒá in 1914, which was transferred to the Akadameski park in the early 1930s from his previous location at the end of the Knez Mihailova street. The square was finally formed in its present shape by 1927, with the park in the central part. Park was planned by architect ƒêorƒëe Kovaljski while the recognizable enclosure and the gates were added in 1929, on the project of Milutin Borisavljeviƒá. == Characteristics == Studentski Trg was projected as the first in a succession of squares around Belgrade's central route from Kalemegdan to Slavija: Studentski Trg-Trg Republike-Terazije-Cvetni Trg-Slavija. In time, Studentski Trg and Terazije pretty much lost their square functions, becoming streets, while Cvetni Trg, with final changes in the early 2000s, is completely defunct as a traffic object. Studentski Trg is turned into the turning point and terminal station for bus line number 31 and majority of Belgrade's trolleybus lines (19, 21, 22, 22L, 28, 29 and 41). Trolleybuses were transferred to the square from the terminal in the nearby Rajiƒáeva Street in 2003. Dorƒáol, below the square, hosts the central depot for city trolleybuses, in the Dunavska Street. After the new city government took over in 2013, an idea of abolishing the trolleybus network was raised, due to the possible creation of the pedestrian zone in the entire central section of Belgrade. Propositions include the change of the routes in downtown, the relocation of the central terminus from Studentski Trg to Slavija Square and of the depo from Dorƒáol to Medakoviƒá. After public protests, the idea was modified in 2015 and the city announced that the terminus from Studentski Trg will be relocated to the Dunavska Street, extending the trolleybus lines to Dorƒáol, as a temporary solution. As of July 2019 nothing has been done regarding the trolleybuses relocation. Kolarac University Studentski Trg is location of many educational and cultural institutions, thus the names (Students Square, Academy Park, etc.). They include: * Rectorate of the University of Belgrade in the representative Captain Mi≈°a's Mansion; * Faculty for Natural Sciences and Mathematics (University of Belgrade); * University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy; * University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology; * Kolarac Public University, with concert hall; * Ethnographic museum; * A monument to Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° on the Faculty of Philosophy Plateau; * A monument to Karl Malden, in front of the Yugoslav Film Archive, dedicated in November 2018; === Glavnjaƒça === On the northern, Dorƒáol side, a building was constructed in 1864 which served as the seat of the Belgrade city administration. But it was also a seat of the city police and the cellar of the building was divided into several rooms which served as the prison cells. The convicts in time named the cells according to their use: ƒÜorka, the smallest one which had no windows (Serbian: ƒáorav, \\"blind\\"); \\"Female salon\\", the female cell; \\"Gentlemen's room\\", the cell for the distinguished citizens; Glavnjaƒça, the main and the largest cell (Serbian: glavno, \\"main\\"). In time, word ƒáorka became a usual Serbian slang for prison in general, while by the early 20th century Glavnjaƒça was colloquially adopted as the name for the entire building. From the start, both the criminals and the political prisoners were jailed, but after 1921 when the Communist party was forbidden by the state, the jail became packed with the political prisoners, separatists and nationalists. Glavnjaƒça gained a notoriety because of the bad conditions, regular torture of the prisoners and for being overcrowded. The cell, which was projected for 60 to 70 people usually had up to 350 people crammed inside. Only in 1921, 15,000 people were incarcerated in Glavnjaƒça. During the 1944 liberation of Belgrade, the building was burned to the ground. The remains were completely demolished in 1953 and the massive building of the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Faculty was built on its location later. In 1974, a memorial was placed in front of the faculty building, celebrating 30 years of the liberation. Work of Milorad Tepavac, it consists of a mosaic with the inscriptions, a slab of marble on it and the bronze flower on the slab. === Faculty of Philosophy Plateau === In the 19th century, before hotels in Belgrade were founded, numerous khans existed in the city. Oriental variant of the roadside inn, they provided travelers with food, drink and resting facilities. One of the largest in Belgrade at the time was the Turkish Khan (Turski han), located where the modern plateau is. In 1964 the request for tender for the new building of the Faculty of Philosophy on the location of the former hotel \\"Grand\\" was announced. As the several surrounding small houses were also demolished, one of the propositions was the wide space between the new faculty building and the Captain Mi≈°a's Mansion. Svetislav Liƒçina, only 34 at the time, won, despite many distinguished architects took part in the tendering. The work was finished in 1974. Liƒçina projected an elevated four-storeys connection between the new and the old building, leaving a wide open connection between the Studentski Trg and Knez Mihailova Street. That way, the small square, piazzetta, formed by the streets of Knez Mihailova and ƒåika Ljubina, with the drinking fountain, continued into the newly formed plateau on Studentski Trg. The plateau is also known as the Academy Plateau. Since the early 1900s there were ideas of erecting a monument to Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈°. During the Interbellum several boards for erection of the monument were formed, which included some of the culture's most prominent people like Branislav Nu≈°iƒá or Ivo Andriƒá, and the Royal Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty even donated money, but due to the disagreements of the convenient location, the monument wasn't built. After World War II, the task of carving the monument was given to Sreten Stojanoviƒá who finished it in 1952 and garnered numerous praises. Serbian government decided to place it on Cvetni Trg, across the Yugoslav Drama Theater, but the city government, supported by the public stalled the process as on this location, the monument to such an important person would be placed next to the public toilet. During this delay, Montenegrin government reacted and placed the monument in Titograd. On 22 June 1989 city assembly decided to place the replica of Stojanoviƒá's work in Belgrade. The heavy duplicate was cast in the \\"Plastika\\" foundry in Dorƒáol. Within the plateau, architect Branko Bojoviƒá arranged the surrounding area of the monument which was officially dedicated on 29 June 1994 by novelist Milorad Paviƒá. Below the plateau is the depot of the Faculty of Philosophy's Department of Psychology. The depot contains some 60 instruments which were used by Wilhelm Wundt in his laboratory for psychological research at Leipzig University. Wundt's work in this famed laboratory, founded in 1879, helped to develop psychology as an independent field of study. Most of the instruments were constructed specifically for Wundt by Emil Zimmermann and Belgrade collection makes a majority of Wundt's instruments. They arrived in Serbia after World War I as part of the German war reparations. The instruments were placed at their present location in 1974 and were placed under state care and protection in the 1990s. == Future == In July 2016 city administration announced the complete reconstruction of Studentski Trg and its adaptation into the pedestrian zone, construction of the underground garage and erection of a monument to the assassinated prime minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá. The project of the reconstruction was designed by Boris Podrecca, but it was met with almost universal criticism from the architects, urbanists and public alike. Architects opposed the general redesign of the square which appears to be planned with the absolute liberty, as if there aren't any cultural, architectural, archaeological or legal limitations due to the protection of the area and that, as such, damages and violates the cultural-monumental protection of the square. Creation of one single, large pedestrian zone from the Republic Square to Kalemegdan and the ban of the traffic was deemed \\"not realistic\\". The project was labeled as the pompous, undeveloped designing intervention based solely on the aesthetic principle and the superficial interpretation of projects seen elsewhere. Other descriptions include the total lack of cultural arguments, lack of ideas, spirit, style and other things which marks the culture and identity of Belgrade. Part of the criticism concerns the public and professional debate on the project, that is, almost complete lack of it. The process of the architectural design competition has been described as \\"we draw the project, without previous thorough analysis and propositions, we win the award and the realization begins!\\", and the entire project was deemed as \\"major incompetence\\". Process was to be reversed: a team of local intellectuals, artists and professionals, well familiar with history, culture and spirit of the locality was to be summoned, and then their conclusions should be handed over to the architects to frame everything. This way, the result is a \\"modern design without any program idea\\", a \\"vain solution witch speaks nothing, except for the present vogue of the design beauty\\". Podrecca was directly criticized for some of his previous problematic projects (Maribor, Trieste, etc.) and his construction of the lifeless and soulless squares. Decision on the removal of the traffic was brought without any proper idea what to do with it and where to conduct it, in the manner of \\"sweeping it under the rug\\". The removal of traffic from this section of the city needs a systematic solution on a much wider city area but the city government didn't provide any. Apparently, by the propositions, author of the project had no obligation to take care of the traffic, so he didn't. The position of Podrecca to decide what will be turned into the pedestrian zone instead of just projecting the square, and the city's decision to close for the traffic streets in downtown has been disputed. Construction of the two- level underground garage is also criticized. As if there is no archaeological locality beneath the park, while the protruding Roman elements, visible on the Faculty of Philosophy Plateau, remain isolated. Handling of these two localities is described as the typical indifference towards the archaeological remains and lack of concern for the cultural heritage. Area of the modern square is the first among the most important urban zones of old Belgrade and is especially important as the locality of ancient Singidunum which developed along the Terazije ridge. The locality has not been properly explored, historically or archaeologically, and now all the Roman and later Byzantine remains will be permanently destroyed. The area of the square was described as having the deepest \\"cultural and historical sedimentation\\" in the city and the original source of the urban culture of Belgrade. It was pointed out that Studentski Trg is one of such ambient spaces which is defined by the elements important for the collective memory. aesthetic, spiritual or emotional experience of the majority of the citizens. That way, such spaces, especially in large cities, have public importance and with preserving the deeper historical layers in time achieve a status of specific historical, social or cultural identity and character. Despite all the criticism, deputy mayor Goran Vesiƒá announced in September 2018 that the construction will start \\"in the fall\\". In April 2019, Archaeological Institute in Belgrade stated that they have been notifying city administration about the problems with the project and the way the remains should be preserved since December 2014, but that they never received any reply. In July 2019, city urbanist Marko Stojƒçiƒá said that if the \\"central part of Singidunum is to be discovered\\", there will be no underground garage, which would then be moved to the Republic Square. In February 2020 Stojƒçiƒá said that \\"public procurement for the geological excavations\\" is on the way, that 3 to 5 survey pits will be dug and if there are remains of Singidunum below, the garage project will be terminated. Instead, pedestrian underground corridor, deep, will be built so that remains will be accessible to visitors. Despite claiming that Podrecca's project will be preserved, with abandoning the garage, introducing the tram tracks and dislocating proposed ƒêinƒëiƒá's monument, the project will be significantly changed. === Monument to Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá === The look of the future monument to the assassinated prime minister was announced on 21 October 2017. A modernist installation, work of sculptor and dramatist Biljana Srbljanoviƒá, represents a \\"bent arrow, broken in the middle, but then continued to unstoppably fly to the skies\\". The arrow will be accompanied by the sound installations, with the recorded voice of ƒêinƒëiƒá. The overwhelmingly negative reaction from the public and professionals resulted in a heated debate, which tackled not only architectural, cultural and visual sides of the project, but also the morality of the idea. Location of the ƒêinƒëiƒá monument, across the Njego≈° monument, has been labeled as the politically opportune, while the monument itself is described as \\"appearing poor and unsustainable.\\" The design competition was said to be a \\"missed opportunity\\" and the direction of the arrow as wrong, as it directs the pedestrians to the sky, instead to Europe, where ƒêinƒëiƒá was leading Serbia. The installation was depicted as inferior compared to the classical Prince Mihailo Monument on the Republic Square and denied its symbolism as \\"ƒêinƒëiƒá himself, as a personality, was a symbol of the future\\". It was suggested that probably the better place for such installation would be the vicinity of the Building of the General Staff, demolished in 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia. Author and artist Mileta Prodanoviƒá, on the other hand, liked the proposition. Opposing voices also mentioned a fact that a monument, which represents a person or an event, in order to remain in the permanent memory, must associate on that person or an event. That passers-by and tourists can't have with them dictionary of symbols all the time. Also, was it a competition for a monument or an installation, in which case the jury missed the point. Association of the Serbian Architects (ASA) asked for the competition to be annulled, citing procedural reasons. They claim the jury digressed from the basic propositions. It includes the anonymity as Bajiƒá directly collaborates with two jury members (Vladimir Veliƒçkoviƒá and Du≈°an Ota≈°eviƒá), while he circled his cipher on the presented work, by which, they allege, he indicated to the jury that it was his work. The ASA also accused Podrecca of the conflict of interest. As a \\"financially interested party\\", being the author of the square reconstruction, he shouldn't serve as the jury president. At the time, city government planned to place the monument on 12 March 2018, on the 15th anniversary of ƒêinƒëiƒá's assassination. As it was planned to be placed at the central part of the present carriageway, the project of transforming the square into the pedestrian zone had to be done first. However, the authorities went quiet on this project, additionally introducing the idea of a tram line across the chosen location. In February 2020, city announced that the monument will be \\"dislocated\\" from its planned position. == References == == External links == Category:Neighborhoods of Belgrade Category:Squares in Belgrade ","title":"Studentski Trg"},{"id":"9143677","text":"Brett McLeod (born 17 June 1963 Melbourne) is an Australian television news reporter and presenter for Nine News Melbourne.Bangkok bloodbath: Nine crew see journalist shot in head == Biography == He is currently a reporter and relief news presenter for Nine News Melbourne and Nine News.

The section of the Cumberland River that includes the falls was designated a Kentucky Wild River by the Kentucky General Assembly through the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves' Wild Rivers System. The forest in the park is also a dedicated State Nature Preserve. ==History== After the discussion of building a hydroelectric power plant above the falls in 1927, Kentucky native T. Coleman du Pont offered to buy the falls and surrounding acreage in order to create a state park. Although he died before he could purchase the land, his wife purchased the falls and the surrounding it for $400,000 on March 10, 1930, after the Kentucky General Assembly (legislature) approved the creation of the state park. Cumberland Falls was dedicated as a state park at 1:30 p.m. on August 21, 1931. Following a $2 million renovation project in 2006, the park received an upgraded rating from two diamonds to three diamonds from the American Automobile Association (AAA) in 2007.

Born in Wimbledon, south London, he is best known as the guitarist from Manfred Mann and The Blues Band. In 1986 he wrote the book So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star. He studied at Wimbledon College. ==Career== Following a stint in the short- lived Roosters with Eric Clapton, McGuinness joined the 1960s group Manfred Mann as a bassist, performing in a line-up with Paul Jones. As the band sought to transform itself from jazz into a rhythm-and-blues-orientated group, he took over bass duties from Dave Richmond and received joint songwriting credits on the group's early hits. Explaining how he came into the group, McGuinness said, \\"They had a great bass guitarist, but he was into Charles Mingus and things like that, which the whole band was. But he refused to play simple bass lines that would fit Bo Diddley numbers. He'd play incredible 3/4 lines and things like that. So I came in and I had the overwhelming advantage of not really being able to play the bass guitar, so I played simple.\\" Appointed the writer of album sleeve notes, he took the opportunity to identify himself as \\"the nastiest in the group\\".Mann Made (HMV 1911). Sleeve notes When Mike Vickers and then Paul Jones left the band, McGuinness started to take the role of guitarist; Jack Bruce then played bass until replaced by Klaus Voormann. McGuinness' National Steel guitar became an important part of the group's sound, and featured on hits such as \\"Pretty Flamingo\\". He composed a few album tracks for the group, notably \\"L.S.D.\\" (from Mann Made), \\"One Way\\", and \\"Cubist Town\\" (from Mighty Garvey!). After Manfred Mann disbanded in 1969, he formed McGuinness Flint with Hughie Flint, which disbanded in 1975. Later he joined Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher in The Blues Band, and in 2016 was still appearing in the band's line-up. McGuinness also performs with The Manfreds, a splinter group from Manfred Mann, formed from the line up in the 1960s Manfred Mann band, but without Mann. == Politics == He came out in support of the Labour Party in the 2010 general election, whilst on tour he supported the candidacy of Bob Blizzard.

It was directed by H. C. Potter and produced by Martin Rackin and Milton Sperling from a screenplay by Roland Kibbee and Allan Scott. (Carrollton Inc. was Hayward's own production company, named for her adopted hometown in Georgia.) The story is very loosely adapted from the 1951 novel Melville Goodwin, U.S.A. by John P. Marquand, which had previously been adapted in 1952 for television's \\"Pulitzer Prize Playhouse.\\" Hollywood avoided filming the novel for years because of its touchy subject matter: a married general's affair with a wealthy journalist. The screenwriters finally wound up rewriting the plot. The names of the two characters‚ÄîMelville Goodwin and Dottie Peale‚Äîwere retained, but both were made single. The film's credits state that it is \\"based on characters\\" in Marquand's book, rather than on the book itself. The music score was by Roy Webb, the cinematography by Stanley Cortez and costume design by Charles LeMaire. The film co-stars Paul Stewart and Jim Backus. The original leads were to be Humphrey Bogart and wife Lauren Bacall, and they were filmed doing a wardrobe test in 1956. But Bogart's illness forced his withdrawal from the project, and Bacall opted to remain at home to care for him until his death in 1957. ==Plot== Melville A. \\"Ironpants\\" Goodwin (Kirk Douglas) is a much-decorated U.S. Army major general who has just been appointed chairman of the Joint Atomic International Commission by the President of the United States. This is upsetting to wealthy Dorothy \\"Dottie\\" Peale (Susan Hayward), a media mogul who wanted a close friend of her father's to get the position. Dottie is accustomed to getting her way and decides to do something about it. She gets the Army to send General Goodwin to her estate on Long Island for a lengthy interview and photo session for one of her popular Peale Enterprises publications. Her plot is to ruin Goodwin's reputation as a squeaky-clean, red-blooded American hero. Dottie hides a tape recorder in her home, and assigns a photographer to catch Goodwin in compromising situations. Having heard rumors that he is secretly a ladies' man, she also hopes to get the general to disclose something scandalous. Every attempt to catch Goodwin off guard or make him appear a fool fails. Drastic measures are called for, what Dottie terms \\"night maneuvers.\\" She takes the general to a nightclub, tries to get him drunk, coaxing him to sing and dance in a vain attempt to humiliate him. Nothing works. A little tipsy herself, Dottie falls off a diving board of her swimming pool at home. Goodwin rescues her, leading to a night of romance. Dottie's attitude is changed. She plans to marry Goodwin and maybe even help him become president of the United States, which would make her first lady. To her surprise, the general has no plans to continue this romance. He tells her about a love affair with a woman named Yvette to whom he revealed top-secret information during the Korean War. When he found out Yvette was an enemy spy, he had to have her shot. A rejected Dottie goes back to her original plan to ruin him. Her magazine's story, \\"Blabbermouth Goodwin\\", results in a Senate inquiry into his behavior. Unfortunately for the general, his activity in the Yvette spy case is still top secret, and he is forbidden to discuss it. Questioned by hostile Senator Burdick (Roland Winters) about another girl in the story, Goodwin reveals that she was not a grown woman but a 7-year-old orphan. He has explanations for everything else and demonstrates that his conduct has been exemplary at all times. Dottie feels ashamed of her role in this and confirms on the stand his assertion that the article was filled with exaggerations and lies. Yet she cannot say the same about the matter of Yvette. Goodwin is unable to get permission to speak about Yvette through the usual channels. In desperation, he sends Colonel Homer Gooch (Jim Backus) to see the President. Finally, the spy case is declassified. The general testifies that the Army knew that Yvette was a spy. When he was informed, he decided to break off the affair, but was ordered to feed her false information in advance of an important counterattack. Goodwin is publicly cleared of wrongdoing and recognized as a bigger hero than ever. In front of a gaggle of Washington reporters, he drags a protesting but obviously willing Dottie into a waiting car, signaling that their romance is on again. ==Cast== * Susan Hayward as Dorothy \\"Dottie\\" Peale * Kirk Douglas as Maj.

Of 1,430 Hampdens manufactured, 160 were built in Canada by the \\"Canadian Associated Aircraft\\" consortium of three Ontario and three Quebec aircraft companies as a so-called \\"educational project\\" to build up the Canadian aircraft industry and provide the expertise for building the four- engined Short Stirling bomber (ultimately the Stirling project was dropped and the Avro Lancaster was substituted).

Due to heavy attrition from accidents, a number of \\"war weary\\" Hampdens were later flown from the UK to Pat Bay as replacements. Hampden Mk I P5436 was one of the Canadian-built Hampdens.

In 1865, Chicago resident Joseph E. Young incorporated the company; the incorporation was approved by the Illinois legislature. In 1869, the first mortgage was issued, on a term of 40 years; it provided $2.5 million in bonds at an interest rate of seven percent. Construction began in 1869, and by 1871 a line was completed from Dolton (near Chicago) to Danville.Lyford 1913, pp. 1‚Äì2.

In each case, the consolidated company maintained the name \\"Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad\\". As a result of these consolidations, the company was enabled to build a coal branch to Brazil, Indiana in Clay County, through Warren, Fountain and Parke Counties.Lyford 1913, p. 2. The first portion of this line was constructed as far as the coal mines south of Covington. It was known as the Indiana Division, but was also called the Pumpkin Vine Railroad. It began operation in 1873, but the line never reached Brazil. According to the minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors, the cost of building this line was substantially more than expected, due partly to the difficulty of crossing the Wabash River between Warren and Fountain Counties. The company soon began to run into financial difficulties. It failed to pay the interest on its mortgages, and attempted to resolve this by issuing further bonds in 1873. Foreclosure and sale occurred in 1877; the Illinois division sold for $1,450,000, and the Indiana division for $115,000.

The park encompasses of land, of water, and features climate-controlled indoor tennis courts. It was Kentucky's first state resort park. Along with Lake Barkley State Resort Park and Kentucky Dam Village State Resort Park, Kenlake State Resort Park is part of the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, originally organized by the Great Depression‚Äìera Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). ==History== The Commonwealth of Kentucky began negotiations with the TVA in 1946 to lease a portion of land known as Aurora Landing. The land was situated on the western shore of Kentucky Lake near the Eggner's Ferry Bridge. Kentucky Lake had just opened, following completion of the Kentucky Dam in 1944. The new lake, created by the dam on the Tennessee River, had the most beach area of any man-made lake in the world. The leased land would be used as a state park dedicated to recreation. The TVA leased an initial 1,146 acres to Kentucky. After the land transfer was officially completed on March 13, 1948, the new park at Aurora Landing was named Kentucky Lake State Park and joined the commonwealth's state parks system. By the 1970s, the name of the park was often shortened to \\"Kenlake State Park\\" rather than \\"Kentucky Lake State Park\\". ===Kenlake Hotel=== In 1950, fifteen vacation cottages were opened in Kentucky Lake State Park, and plans were announced to construct a hotel inside the new Kentucky Lake State Park. The Kenlake Hotel was constructed at a cost of $600,000, and it opened in Spring 1952. The hotel originally had 60 guest rooms, each with twin beds and private bathrooms.\\"$400,000 Kentucky Lake Hotel Slated for Coal Creek Section\\". Kentucky New Era.

The property also includes 34 cottages, some of which belonged originally to the defunct Cherokee State Park, which was nearby.Bailey, op.cit., p. 175. A 90-site camping-ground is also available for overnight stays. ===Cherokee State Park=== Kenlake State Resort Park contains an area that was originally known as Cherokee State Park. Cherokee State Park was the third blacks-only state park in the United States. It was the first such state park in Kentucky, as well as the Southern United States. The park was opened in 1951 as the companion to the whites-only Kentucky Lake State Park, and it was publicized as \\"the finest colored vacation site in the South\\". The park was originally 300 acres, and it included a beach, cottages, boat and fishing docks, a picnic area, a bathhouse, and a 200-seat dining hall. It was designed to provide the same standards as Kentucky Lake State Park under the separate but equal doctrine. Cherokee State Park was closed by 1964 after Governor Bert T. Combs signed the executive order ending segregation in 1963. The land was transferred to the control of Kentucky Lake State Park. The Cherokee State Park area remained abandoned for many years until it was cleaned up and re-purposed for use by the Murray State University rowing team. The university leased the park area and used some remaining structures to establish a boathouse and a trophy room as Murray State began NCAA level rowing competition in 1998. The university later cut the rowing program in 2008. The former park and the remaining structures were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. The former Cherokee State Park dining hall was renovated and reopened in Fall 2010 as a meeting and event facility. The renovated dining hall is now known as the Richard H. Lewis Lodge. ==Park Activities== There are several activities available at the park. Fishing is a popular pastime; crappie are the most popular fish at the park, with bluegill, catfish, sauger, and various types of bass also available.Bailey, op.cit., pp. 178, 179.

SHS houses the only International Baccalaureate programme in the division, as well as being one of two sites for the Commonwealth Governor's School, both of these centers are made up of students accepted into the program who come from SHS as well as other high schools in Spotsylvania County, SHS also works in partnership with Germanna Community College to offer the Gladys P. Todd academy where students attend GCC during the day for their junior and senior years - achieving an Associates Degree along with their high school diploma upon graduation. The Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program is known as the Knight Battalion which consists of cadets from both Massaponax High School and Spotsylvania High School. The Knight Battalion as of 2008-2009 school year is an Honor Unit with Distinction. The Original Spotsylvania High School opened in 1940 and three schools hosted the name of Spotsylvania High School. As of the 2017-2018 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,152 students and 80.1 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student‚Äìteacher ratio of 14.1:1. There were 371 students (33.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 92 (8.2% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.School data for Spotsylvania High, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed December 12, 2016. ==About the building== Spotsylvania High was the county‚Äôs first consolidated high school for students who had previously attended much smaller schools in tiny rural communities including Marye and Margo. Spotsylvania High, on Courthouse Road, was considered state of the art when it opened; when numbers of students grew, the next Spotsylvania High School was built across the street in 1967. Black students from segregated John J. Wright High School began attending Spotsylvania High when schools became fully integrated in 1968. The third and current Spotsylvania High opened in 1994. Construction started on the school in May, 1992 and occupied in January, 1994. The cost of the project was reported to be $23.7 million. A total of were developed for the school. Within the building there is of space. Total capacity is 1583 students in 79 classrooms. The auditorium can seat 1300, the gymnasium seats 2000, and the stadium seats 4000 people. Massaponax High School, built in 1998, was constructed from the same blueprint as Spotsylvania High School. ==Administration== Mr. Kelly Guempel is the current principal of Spotsylvania High School. Assistant principals include Mr. Robert Marchetti, Mrs. Veronica Jackson, and Mr. Reitha Abed. Other administration staff include Ms. Michelle Hart, Instructional Coordinator, Mr. William Swink, Activities Director, and Ms. Rachel Bentley-Goode, School Counseling Director. Following the 2015-2016 school year, Principal Rusty Davis and Athletic Director Buddy Herndon were reassigned to different positions in the school system for unknown reasons. == Advanced Placement Program and International Baccalaureate Programme == The Advanced Placement (AP) Program gives students the opportunity to pursue college-level studies while still at Spotsylvania County. Upon completion of the courses, students may receive advanced placement and/or credit when entering college. Academically oriented students are strongly encouraged to participate in the Advanced Placement Program. Students take these courses at high school. Advanced Placement (AP) courses follow the suggested College Board course curriculum and serve to prepare students for the AP examinations in May. AP Courses listed below are offered based on enrollment. However, depending on how many students sign up for an AP class, depends on which course is offered. So some of the courses may not be offered because there are not enough students that sign up for it. Grades earned carry weighted credit in the GPA calculation. The International Baccalaureate Programme (IB) is a new program to SHS, with the Class of 2018 seeing its first graduates. Currently, Spotsylvania High School offers the Diploma Programme. The International Baccalaureate¬Æ (IB) offers a continuum of international education. The programmes encourage both personal and academic achievement, challenging students to excel in their studies and in their personal development. The programme aims to develop students who have excellent breadth and depth of knowledge ‚Äì students who flourish physically, intellectually, emotionally and ethically. == Athletics == Spotsylvania High school has won 4 State championships since their existence. The most recent State Championship is the 13-8 win in extra innings against Abingdon High school on June, 9th, 2018.

The project refers to two aircraft designs: the Ki-94-I and the Ki-94-II, both of which did not advance beyond the mock-up and prototype stage respectively. ==Design and developmentKi-94-I=== A full- scale wooden mock-up of the Ki-94-I. The first was a twin-boom monoplane with two Mitsubishi Ha211 18-cylinder engines, driving two 4-blade propellers in a push-pull configuration. The very heavy armament that should have been mounted on the aircraft (two 37 mm/1.46 in and two 30 mm/1.18 in cannon,. should have been enough to make short work of most US heavy bombers of the era. Notwithstanding the outstanding prospective performance, which however was judged as \\"unduly optimistic\\" by the technical department of the Japanese Army Air Force, this design was judged too complex by the technical department and the design was discarded. ===Ki-94-II=== The first prototype of the Ki-94-II under construction. The second Ki-94 design, made by a team also under Tatsuo Hasegawa as type I, chief designer of the aircraft and responsible for the used airfoil, was a more conventional single-seat, piston-engine monoplane fighter, developed for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force along the same requirements as the Nakajima Ki-87, which had been the Army's fall-back design for the original Ki-94. Intended to counter B-29 raids, it was optimized for high-altitude interception with a pressurized cockpit and heavy armament. This design was approved by the Koku Hombu, and the aircraft was designated Ki-94-II (the scrapped earlier Ki-94 design was named the Ki-94-I). An order was placed for one static test airframe, three prototypes, and eighteen pre- production aircraft. Only 2 prototypes were built in the event; the first was equipped with a single Nakajima Ha219 [Ha-44] engine, driving a 4-blade propeller because the 6-blade one was not ready. The second prototype was to be fitted with a 6-blade propeller. The war's end however stopped the construction of the second prototype and also found the first prototype still being readied for its maiden flight, the Ki-94-II never taking to the air. ==Specifications (Ki-94-II (estimated performance))== ==See also== ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * .

In 1816 she married Gideon Mantell and lived with him in Lewes. She accompanied Mantell on his fossil collection trips. Although the couple became a coherent research team, their personal lives suffered and the pair became increasingly distant causing their marriage to end in divorce. They had three children together, including prominent New Zealand scientist and politician Walter Mantell. Gideon was the primary caretaker of the children after the divorce was finalized; he died in 1852 of an opium overdose.BUREK, C. V. & HIGGS, B. (eds) The Role of Women in the History of Geology.

Williams started his career at Scunthorpe United before moving to Reading and then to Sheffield United. Williams has signed for Scunthorpe on four separate occasions, twice on a permanent contract and twice on loan, as well as spending a short period on loan with Peterborough United. ==CareerScunthorpe United=== Williams was born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. He began his career as a trainee with Scunthorpe United, signing a professional contract on 3 August 2005. ===Reading=== He signed for Championship club Reading on 11 May 2010 on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract after he turned down a new contract at Scunthorpe.

He has won 14 World Championships (record of men) and won a gold, silver and a bronze at the Summer Olympics. ==Biography== Tournant was born in Roubaix, near the border with Belgium, and currently lives in Fontenay-sous-Bois. He began making his mark as an international rider whilst still in the junior ranks, winning the silver medal at the Junior Track World Championships in 1996. ===World record=== Tournant is the world record holder (at altitude) for the Kilo (1000m time trial). He first set the record in Mexico in 2000, with a time of 1:00.148. In October the following year, at the age of 23, Tournant became the first man to go under the one-minute mark, breaking his own world record with a new time of 58.875 seconds set at La Paz, Bolivia. Chris Hoy came to within 0.005 seconds of Tournant's record on his second attempt, but failed to beat it. Hoy said he could not go any faster, and had even more respect for Tournant and his talents. ===2004=== Tournant was a member of the French team sprint squad at the 2004 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, this was the sixth time they won a gold medal with Tournant. He also picked up a silver medal in the Kilo. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Tournant won a silver medal in the kilo, and a bronze in the team sprint. Tournant refused to speak at a post-race press conference at the Olympics, until Stephane Mandard, a journalist for Le Monde newspaper, and an anti-doping campaigner, left the room. Mandard's reporting of the Cofidis doping scandal had left scars, despite the fact that Tournant had not been involved. At the press conference, Tournant held his ground and after a long pause, Mandard walked out. ===2008 and retirement=== Tournant was a member of the team sprint squad (with Gr√©gory Baug√©, K√©vin Sireau and Micka√´l Bourgain) which won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He retired after these Olympic Games and was made a Commander of the Ordre national du M√©rite on 14 November 2008. However, he will continue to be involved in cycling as he has been named as the new directeur sportif of the Cofidis track team. ==Major results== ;1996 :2nd Sprint, Track World Championships - Junior ;1997 :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;1998 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Cali (with Laurent Gan√© & Damien Gerard) :1st Sprint, World Cup, Cali :1st Kilo, World Cup, Berlin :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Berlin ;1999 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Cali (with Micka√´l Bourgain & Vincent Le Quellec) :1st Sprint, World Cup, Cali :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2000 :1st Team Sprint, 2000 Summer Olympics :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2001 :Kilo World record in La Paz, 58.875 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2002 :2nd Kilo, UCI Track World Championships :2nd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Monterrey (with Franck Durivaux & Arnaud Dubl√©) :1st Kilo, World Cup, Monterrey :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2003 :2nd Kilo, French National Track Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships :3rd Kilo, Track World Championships :2nd Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2004 :2nd Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Kilo, World Cup, Aguascalientes :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Aguascalientes :1st Kilo, French National Track Championships :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships :2nd Kilo, 2004 Summer Olympics :3rd Team Sprint, 2004 Summer Olympics ;2005 :2nd Keirin, World Cup, Los Angeles :2nd Sprint, World Cup, Los Angeles :3rd Team Sprint, World Cup, Los Angeles :3rd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Sprint, French National Track Championships :2nd Keirin, French National Track Championships ;2006 :3rd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :3rd Keirin, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2007 :3rd Masters of Sprint :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2008 :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Team Sprint, 2008 Summer Olympics ==References* * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:French male cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of France Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for France Category:Olympic silver medalists for France Category:Olympic bronze medalists for France Category:UCI Track Cycling World Champions (men) Category:Commanders of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Sportspeople from Roubaix Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:French track cyclists ","title":"Arnaud Tournant"},{"id":"9144437","text":"The decade of the 1970s saw significant changes in television programming in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The trends included the decline of the \\"family sitcoms\\" and rural-oriented programs to more socially contemporary shows and \\"young, hip and urban\\" sitcoms in the United States and the permanent establishment of colour television in the United Kingdom. ==Overall trendsUnited Kingdom=== In 1967, BBC Two had started trials of their new colour service, and it was gradually rolled out over the next few years. BBC One and ITV followed suit in 1969, so by 1970 the viewer had three colour channels from which to choose: BBC1, BBC2 and ITV. Although U.S. imports occupied a significant proportion of airtime, there was a substantial amount of high quality in-house production too. The BBC, supported by its licence fee and with no advertisers to placate, continued fulfilling its brief to entertain and inform. The Play for Today was a continuation of the Wednesday Play which had run from the mid-1960s. As the title implied, it presented TV drama which had relevance to current social and economic issues, done in a way calculated to intrigue or even shock the viewer. As well as using established writers, it was effectively an apprenticeship for new ones who were trying to make a name for themselves; Dennis Potter, John Mortimer, Arthur Hopcraft and Jack Rosenthal all served time on Play for Today before going on to write their own independent series. In style, the plays could go from almost documentary realism (of which Cathy Come Home is the best known example) to the futuristic or surrealist (The Year of the Sex Olympics, House of Character). Potter went on to write Pennies from Heaven, one of the landmarks of 1970's television drama. It had the now familiar elements of Potter's style: sexual explicitness, nostalgia, fantasy song and dance scenes, all overlaying a dark and pessimistic view of human motivation. The series was a success, but the BBC was not yet ready for Brimstone and Treacle, a story of the rape of a physically and mentally handicapped young woman. After viewing it, the BBC's Director Of Programs Alasdair Milne, pronouncing it to be \\"brilliantly written ... but nauseating\\", withdrew it, and it would not be shown on British television until 1987. Things had begun to change in the 1960s, with Till Death Us Do Part, and the series continued during 1972‚Äì75. The rantings of Alf Garnett on race, class, religion, education and anything else at all definitely touched a nerve. Although the show was in fact poking fun at right-wing bigotry, not everyone got the joke. Some ‚Äî including, notably, Mary Whitehouse ‚Äî complained about the language (although the level of profanity was quite light) and resented the racial epithets like \\"wog\\" and \\"coon\\" and the attitudes underlying them. Others, completely missing the point of the show, actually adopted Alf as their hero, thinking he was uttering truths that others didn't dare to ‚Äî apparently oblivious to the fact that he never got the best of any argument and was regularly shown up to be stupid and ill-informed. The series regularly provoked controversy in the media, and for millions it became a common gossiping point at work or in the pub. Many popular British situation comedies (sitcoms) were gentle, innocent, not challenging portrayals of middle-class life, avoiding or only hinting at controversial issues; typical examples were Happy Ever After (later succeeded by Terry and June), Sykes and The Good Life. Set in a hotel in Torquay, Fawlty Towers was a massive success for the BBC, despite only twelve episodes being made. More nostalgic in tone were Last of the Summer Wine, about the escapades of pensioners in a Yorkshire town, Dad's Army, about a Home Guard unit during World War II and It Ain't Half Hot Mum about a Royal Artillery Concert Party stationed in India/later Burma also during (and after) World War II. A more diverse view of society was offered by series like Porridge, a comedy about prison life, and Rising Damp, set in a lodging house inhabited by two students, a lonely spinster and a lecherous landlord. Taking a softer approach to race than Till Death Us Do Part, ITV's Mind Your Language (1977‚Äì79) represented several foreign nations personified as English language students attending an evening class. Despite LWT ending the show after its third series in objection to the undeniable stereotyping, Mind Your Language did later return for a fourth series in the 1980s. In police dramas, there was a move towards increasing realism. Dixon of Dock Green continued until 1976, but it was essentially a nostalgic look back to an earlier time when police officers were depicted as a mix of strict but fair law enforcer, and kindly social worker. On the other hand, detective series such as Softly, Softly (a spin-off from the earlier Z-Cars) began to show police work done by fallible human beings with their own personal failings and weaknesses, constantly frustrated by the constraints under which they worked. Such series showed crime at the level of petty larceny and fraud, being tackled by ordinary coppers on the beat. Serious organised crime, on the other hand, was the province of various elite units, and one show in the 1970s set a new standard. The Sweeney presented a hard, gritty picture of an armed police unit ‚Äî members of Scotland Yard's elite Flying Squad. Violence was routine, as were fast car chases; Regan and Carter were hard-hitting coppers, who when they weren't catching villains were likely to be on a drunken binge or womanizing.#2323123 Although this was a truer picture of British policing, it was not always to the liking of senior police officers, who felt that the confidence of the public in the police force would be diminished as a result. In police dramas, through most of the 1970s however, corruption was rare, the detection rate was unrealistically high, and the criminals arrested were always convicted on solid evidence. Although the officers in The Sweeney were no angels, and there were occasional hints that police who inhabited a world where informants were necessary could not completely avoid compromises, these never amounted to more than turning a blind eye to minor misdemeanours. It would not be until 1978 that a police drama (the miniseries Law and Order) would depict a police officer fabricating evidence to secure a conviction, with the collusion of his colleagues. ===United States=== Long-standing trends reach the end of the road At the start of the decade, long-standing trends in American television were finally reaching the end of the road. The Red Skelton Show and The Ed Sullivan Show, long-revered American institutions, were finally canceled after multi-decade spans. The \\"family sitcom\\", popularized by the travails of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson in the 1950s and 1960s, saw its last breath at the start of the new decade with The Brady Bunch, which ran for five seasons. Although the show was never highly rated during its original run, it has been broadcast in syndication continuously since 1974, and many children have grown up with it, causing them to think of the Bradys as the quintessential family ‚Äî not only in 1970s television, but quite possibly all of American television. In the early 1970s the high concept sitcoms like I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched began to lose American interest with I Dream of Jeannie ending its run in 1970 and Bewitched ending in 1972. The death of rural-oriented programming and the rise of \\"socially conscious\\" programming In 1971; CBS, tired of being ridiculed as the \\"Hillbilly Network\\" because the majority of its hit shows were rural-oriented, cancelled The Beverly Hillbillies, Hee Haw, Green Acres and Mayberry RFD plus every show \\"that had a tree in it\\" as described by actor Pat Buttram. In its place, shows that appealed to a younger, more urban demographic became commonplace. It was transformed by what became termed as \\"social consciousness\\" programming, spearheaded by television producer Norman Lear. All in the Family, his adaptation of the British television series Till Death Us Do Part, broke down television barriers. When the series premiered in 1971, Americans heard the words \\"fag,\\" \\"jigaboo,\\" and \\"spic\\" on national television programming for the first time. All in the Family was the talk of countless dinner tables throughout the country; Americans hadn't seen anything like it on television before. The show became the highest-rated program on U.S. television schedules in the fall of 1971 and stayed in the top slot until 1976 ‚Äî to date, only one other series has tied All in the Family for such a long stretch at the top of the ratings. All in the Family spawned numerous spin-offs, such as Maude, starring Bea Arthur. Maude was Edith Bunker's cousin and Archie's archenemy. She stood for everything liberal and was an outspoken advocate of civil rights and feminism. Like All in the Family, Maude broke new ground in television and presented American audiences with something they had never encountered on television before when Maude admitted, without guilt or shame, to planning to have an abortion. Maude felt most comfortable, however, hiring a black woman as her housekeeper. Maude's housekeeper, Florida Evans (played by Esther Rolle), became popular in her own right and was given her own television series in 1974, Good Times, which proved to be another hit for Lear's production company. Lear developed two shows in 1975: The Jeffersons, a spin- off of All in the Family in which Archie Bunker's black next-door neighbors moved to a luxury apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and One Day at a Time, about a single mother raising her two teenage daughters in Indianapolis. The decline of the western With the rise in socially responsible programming, the television western, a very popular genre in the 1960s, slowly died out. The first casualties were The High Chaparral and The Virginian, both NBC staples, in the spring of 1971. Bonanza suffered a blow when actor Dan Blocker died during surgery in 1972, and the show quietly ended its run the next year. CBS's Gunsmoke outlasted them all, and finally ended its run with a star-studded series finale in 1975. Bonanza actor Michael Landon helped popularize a television adaptation of the popular children's book series Little House on the Prairie. Debuting in 1974, the series ran for eight years. Little House's competitor family drama was CBS's The Waltons, which revolved around family unity but during a different time and place ‚Äî Virginia during the Great Depression. Medical shows Medical shows were popular in the early 1970s; Marcus Welby, M.D. was the first medical drama ever to tackle many subjects on television for ABC, the same for Medical Center for CBS, those shows aired for 7 seasons. Other shows such as Emergency!, was also the first series ever to feature both the paramedic and the emergency hospital, starring Robert Fuller and Julie London, which also launched the career of Randolph Mantooth, and M*A*S*H, starring Alan Alda, focused on the days of the Korean War, combined both comedy and drama. Jiggle television and crime shows By the mid-to-late 1970s, viewers tired of socially responsible sitcoms. Former CBS head of programming Fred Silverman defected to struggling ABC started the trend of TV centred on sexual gratification and bawdy humor and situations, nicknamed \\"jiggle television.\\" Jiggle TV shows included the crime-fighting television series Charlie's Angels, which starred up-and-coming sex symbols Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and Kate Jackson and the risqu√© sitcom such as Three's Company, modeled after the British series Man About the House, in which swinging single-man Robin Trip pretended to be gay in order to live in an apartment with two single women. Mildly controversial at the time, the show quickly became a Top Ten hit in the ratings. The aforementioned Charlie's Angels was one of many crime shows to prosper during the 1970s. Another show, Police Woman starring Angie Dickinson, was the first show, ever to have a female lead in the title role, also became a sex symbol. Other successful TV crime dramas of the decade included The Streets of San Francisco, Columbo, Barnaby Jones, The Rockford Files, Starsky & Hutch, Kojak and, above all, Hawaii Five-O, for many years considered the longest-running police show in the history of American television. However, crime shows often came under fire during the 1970s from various groups decrying the programs' often-violent content and demanded that companies pull their ads from such programs.Gitlin, Todd. Inside Prime Time. New York: Pantheon, 1983. 1977 saw the debut of CHiPs, an action-packed police show where the cops very seldom drew their guns. One year earlier, Quincy, M.E., a mystery-crime show centered around an inquisitive medical examiner who often immersed himself in contemporary hot-button issues, had bowed on NBC. Science-fiction A science-fiction trend accelerated as the 1970s decade progressed. A number of sci-fi shows, many of them from Universal TV, achieved at least a measure of popularity during this period. They included The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, Battlestar Galactica, Wonder Woman, The Incredible Hulk and Fantasy Island. The soap opera boom Another popular medium in U.S. television moving into the 1970s was the soap opera, which moved from being a genre watched exclusively by housewives to having a sizable audience of men (who largely watched The Edge of Night) and college students; the latter audience helped All My Children gain a devoted following, as it was on during many universities' traditional \\"lunch period.\\" In a TIME article written about the genre in 1976, it was estimated that as many as 35 million households tuned into at least one soap opera each afternoon, the most popular being As the World Turns, which routinely grabbed viewing figures of twelve million or higher each day. The soap boom spawned a nighttime soap parody, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, which made a quick star out of Louise Lasser, who played the eponymous heroine. A rising soap opera toward the decade's end was Ryan's Hope, which capitalized on the everyman success of the film Rocky (despite Ryan's Hope debuting earlier; the show's success came a while after the movie's release). The serial was about an Irish-American family running a pub in New York City, and earned critical acclaim from television critics for its realistic portrayal of an \\"ethnic\\" middle-class family in a contemporary setting. The show's matriarch, played by Helen Gallagher, won two Daytime Emmys by decade's end. Also during the decade General Hospital, a soap that spent most of the decade with bad ratings (It was almost canceled in 1976) saw a rise in popularity around late 1978 due to its more youthful focus. However, it would not yet become a ratings giant until the 1980s. ABC aired Soap, a sitcom that parodied soap operas, and garnered controversy by writing in one of the first gay characters on U.S. television. Many stations refused to air the series (another storyline consisted of heroine Corinne Tate, played by Diana Canova, lusting after a priest who eventually left the priesthood to marry her). Silverman's legacy also included the escapist \\"fantasy\\" genre, which started in 1977 with The Love Boat. The series involved popular movie and television stars in guest roles as passengers on a luxury cruise liner that sailed up and down the Pacific Coast. Silverman followed up in 1978 with Fantasy Island, starring Ricardo Montalban and Herv√© Villechaize. Montalban and Villechaize were the owner and sidekick, respectively, of a luxury island resort where peoples' wishes came true. Daytime game shows Daytime television was consumed with several game shows, airing alongside soap operas during the mornings and afternoons. During the early years of the decade, The Hollywood Squares (NBC) was the most popular, winning numerous Emmy awards. Hosted by masterly emcee Peter Marshall, nine celebrities in a large tic-tac-toe board ‚Äî among them, archetypical center square Paul Lynde ‚Äî responded to miscellaneous questions. Contestants must state whether they \\"agree\\" or \\"disagree\\" with the answers and if they are correct, their \\"X\\"/\\"O\\" symbol lights up in the celeb's box. The first to get three in a row or a five-square win succeeds and wins money. Bluffs and zingers made this the essential show to watch on afternoons. In the mid-1970s Match Game (CBS) was the most popular game show (it was #1 among them from 1973 to 1977), in a time when there were many of them. Players must match the answers of panelists like Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly. Fill-in-the-blank questions involving crude humor, zany panelists, several hilarious incidents, and pure \\"fun\\" between the panel and \\"ringmaster\\" host Gene Rayburn made it popular. At one point, it broke records as the highest- rated daytime TV show in U.S. history. The show launched a spin-off, Family Feud (ABC), an enormously prominent game which prevailed as the #1 game show of the late 1970s. Two families squared off in assuming the most common answers to surveys of 100 people across the nation with such questions as, \\"name a public figure most Americans dislike.\\" The simple concept was the main cause of its success, but interesting answers and the clever wit of Richard Dawson fueled the show's amazingly high ratings. Other successful game shows during this decade included The Price Is Right (still on the air to this day), Let's Make a Deal, The $20,000 Pyramid, The Gong Show, The Newlywed Game, Password, Tattletales, Tic Tac Dough, Bowling for Dollars, Break the Bank and The Joker's Wild. Television newscasts Another influential genre was the television newscast, which built on its initial widespread success in the 1960s. Each of the three television networks had widely recognizable and respected journalists helming their newscasts: CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who was voted \\"The Most Trusted Man in America\\" many times over, led in the nightly ratings. NBC's John Chancellor and David Brinkley were a strong second, while ABC, perennially third place in the news department until the 1990s, had a newscast helmed by Howard K. Smith. The rise of telefilms The success of the 1971 telefilm Duel signaled the rise of movies produced specifically for television. Some featured a hero or heroine whose life was in jeopardy, while others were pilots for proposed TV series to be picked up by a network. (Some sold; many did not.) Still others centered on the destructiveness of a certain disease, whether medical or social. Roots, a multi-part miniseries that ran on a number of consecutive nights in early 1977, proved to be a huge hit in the ratings and thus paved the way for others of its kind like Shogun and The Thorn Birds. Variety shows The variety show received its last hurrah during this decade. Popular during the 1950s and 1960s, variety shows carried on in the 1970s with The Carol Burnett Show. With a repertory company that included Vicki Lawrence, Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the veterans' series continued to be successful and ran well into the mid-1970s. NBC aired a variety show of its own, starring African-American comedian Flip Wilson. The Flip Wilson Show became a success and became the first show headed by an African-American comedian to become a ratings winner. In 1971, while Fred Silverman was still working for CBS, he spotted singing duo Sonny & Cher doing a stand-up concert and decided to turn it into a weekly variety show. In addition to some entertaining stand-up banter between the husband and wife, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour would also have skits and music (mostly sung by Cher). The show was a ratings winner from the first episode and ran for three years. It was followed in the same vein shortly after by singing group Tony Orlando and Dawn. Another group of singers who received a variety show in the 1970s were two of the famous singing Osmonds ‚Äî Donny and his sister Marie. Sid & Marty Krofft set to work on the siblings' series and Donny & Marie premiered on ABC in the winter of 1976. Although the show became very popular, the Osmonds were equally ridiculed for their wholesome image and Mormon moral reputation (on an episode of Good Times, the lead character, Florida, listed three things in the world you just can't do, and one was \\"smile wider than Donny and Marie\\"). Producers of 1970s television Many prime-time programs of the 1970s were helmed by independent producers, often in association with a major Hollywood studio. A particularly successful independent producer at the dawn of the decade was Quinn Martin, who produced such crime shows as The Streets of San Francisco, Cannon, and Dan August (a one-season cop series starring an up-and-coming Burt Reynolds that would find greater popularity after its star had hit it big at the cinema).Etter, Jonathan. Quinn Martin, Producer. Jefferson: McFarland, 2003. Martin's success would fade during the latter half of the decade, however; by the end of 1980, the erstwhile mega-producer would be left without a single prime-time network series on the air. As for other producers during the period, Norman Lear produced the socially relevant All in the Family as well as more innocuous fare such as One Day at a Time. Jack Webb, a holdover from previous decades, oversaw Adam-12 and Emergency!, the latter highly popular with young children.McNeil, Alex. Total Television. 1980. New York: Penguin, 1991. Glen A. Larson produced a number of series in association with Universal TV (McCloud, Switch, etc.), while David Gerber made a name for himself with such fare as Police Woman and Police Story. (The latter was a one-hour anthology series with no real regulars.) Among 1970s TV producers, however, it was Aaron Spelling who would go on to be perhaps, according to an article written by Michael Idato for The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"the most prolific producer in TV history.\\" Like Quinn Martin, Spelling was known for producing crime dramas (S.W.A.T., Starsky & Hutch). However, Spelling also produced more escapist fare as represented by the likes of The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, and even the private-eye opus Charlie's Angels. There was also Family, a socially relevant hour-long series which would win a number of Emmys during its four- year run.http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=family Spelling's success would continue well into the 1990s. ==Television by year== *1970 in television - Monday Night Football debuts on (ABC) Mary Tyler Moore and All My Children premiere, as does the BBC Nine O'Clock News and The Goodies in the UK. *1971 in television - All in the Family premieres.

C. Andrews and published in 1993. It is allegedly based on the original ideas of Andrews but was written by ghostwriter Andrew Neiderman. Andrews is the credited author. The novel made The New York Times bestseller list for paperbacks in 1993.PAPERBACK BEST SELLERS - New York Times ==Plot summary== Darkest Hour is a prequel to Dawn. The last book in the Cutler series goes back in time to focus on Dawn's step- grandmother, Lillian. This book is about Grandmother Cutler's childhood and adolescence. Most of the book takes place at the Booth plantation, \\"The Meadows\\". Lillian Booth is the middle daughter of an overbearing planter known as the Captain and a delicate Southern woman who lives in a dream world of sorts. Her older sister, Emily, is devoutly religious and often hostile to Lillian; her younger sister, Eugenia, is sick with cystic fibrosis (a factual oversight on the author's part is that CF was not technically named until 1938, by Dr. Dorothy Andersen,https://www.nationaljewish.org/healthinfo/conditions/cysticfibrosis/history and the book appears to be set shortly before and during the Great Depression. Lillian's family could not have known Eugenia's disease by this name). One day after school, when Lillian is just five, Emily tells her that she is not her real sister and that Lillian's real parents died because she is a Jonah and everything she touches will die. Distraught, Lillian runs to their mother, only to find out that she is actually the daughter of her mother's younger sister Violet, whose young husband was tragically killed before Lillian's birth. Violet died during childbirth and Lillian was taken in by her aunt and uncle to be brought up as their own. Emily constantly brings up the theme of Lillian being a curse throughout the book: she locks her in the shed with a skunk, and murders Cotton, Eugenia and Lillian's kitten (though she makes this look like an accident). She even claims that Lillian's first period is a sign of her evil nature, due to her young age. Emily also blames Lillian for Eugenia's death, saying that Eugenia was born after Lillian brought Satan into the Meadows and that was how Eugenia became sick in the first place. Eugenia dies from smallpox due to being weakened from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that is not understood at the time that the novel takes place. (However, there is no mention of how Eugenia, who is rarely outside or in anyone else's company, contracted a highly-contagious disease like smallpox. No one else in the area is mentioned as having fallen ill with it, as well. This is one of many minor plot points that does not make sense.) Therefore, when Lillian asks for Dawn to be renamed Eugenia many years later, it may be an attempt to get back the little sister she lost so early and loved so much. Lillian's mother is traumatized by the death of her youngest child and goes into a deep depression. With her mother lost in depression, Lillian becomes increasingly isolated at home. Although she is growing into a young woman, her father makes no preparations for her coming out party or for her impending adulthood. When Emily sees Lillian and Niles Thompson, a boy from a neighbouring plantation, coming out of the woods on the way back from school, she uses this against Lillian to make sure she is placed under a sort of 'house arrest', not to go further than the house grounds. On the night of his twin sisters' big party, Niles climbs up to Lillian's bedroom window because Lillian was forbidden to go to the party. Although they dance and kiss, Lillian sends Niles home before things go too far. She goes to sleep happy but when she wakes up, she is told that Niles was found dead on the ground by her window. Emily blames her for Niles's death and Lillian accepts this guilt. With Niles dead, she has lost her last confidante. As the Great Depression arrives, The Meadows begins to slip into debt. Emily blames Lillian for this. Not knowing how to restore The Meadows, Captain Booth begins to drink heavily and more often, which results in him falling down the stairs and breaking his leg. He tells Lillian that she must move into his quarters and take care of him until he is well. This ends in Lillian being repeatedly raped by her father while he is drunk. Lillian becomes pregnant at the age of 14. She is in her father's office reading up on pregnancy when the Captain catches her. She reveals that she is pregnant with his child. At this point, her father makes it seem as if Niles is the father of her child and puts Lillian in the hands of Emily, who sets out to cleanse Lillian's soul of Satan. The pregnant Lillian is locked away in her room, which has been stripped of all comforts, while the Captain tells everyone that his ailing wife is the pregnant one. About a month before Lillian gives birth, her mother passes away from cancer. Not wanting Lillian to give birth prematurely, the Captain and Emily tell Lillian she is no longer allowed to see her because it upsets her mother. Lillian later finds out that her mother had been dying of stomach cancer the entire time. The death is blamed on childbirth and her mother is buried right after Lillian gives birth to a baby girl, which she names Charlotte. Lillian is told not to refer to Charlotte as her baby, as Emily and the Captain have told everyone the baby is her sister. The Captain's only regret over the whole affair is that Charlotte is a girl and not the son he always longed for. The Meadows continues to fail as a plantation. While trying to win money, Captain Booth loses the plantation to Bill Cutler, the owner of the luxury Cutler Hotel Resort near Virginia Beach. When Bill visits the plantation to see what he has won, he becomes very taken with Lillian, despite her disdainful treatment of him. Having seen that the plantation will make him no money, he tells the Captain that instead of the Meadows, he will take Lillian. After many tears, Lillian agrees to marry a man whom she does not love or even really like, thinking that at least she can leave The Meadows behind. Although she wants to take Charlotte with her, the Captain refuses, thinking that someone may find out Lillian is really her mother, so she has to leave her baby behind. Bill and Lillian marry and she becomes the new mistress of Cutler's Cove. Determined that no man will ever control her again, she gradually becomes the brains behind the management of the hotel, though Bill remains the public face. She also becomes pregnant and has a boy, Randolph. Despite Bill's complaints that he will grow up to be a \\"mama's boy\\", Lillian takes Randolph everywhere with her, letting him play in her office while she conducts her business negotiations. She goes back to visit the Meadows only a few times, as she finds it hard to deal with how dilapidated and dingy it has become, and also to see Charlotte growing up without really knowing her. The Captain dies soon after Randolph's birth, having gambled away nearly everything in drunken attempts to get back all the money he lost. Emily never changes. Lillian sends her money for Charlotte and the upkeep of the plantation but knows that there will never be enough. Despite the fact her husband has affairs and is never half the family man he promised to be, she is satisfied that nobody will take her son from her and that she is secure as the mistress of Cutler's Cove. ==Characters== *Lillian Booth: Niece of Jed and Georgia Booth (adoptive parents).

Andrews Category:American young adult novels Category:Great Depression novels ","title":"Darkest Hour (Andrews novel)"},{"id":"9144443","text":"Reading Like a Writer is a writing guide by American writer Francine Prose, published in 2006. ==Background== Subtitled \\"A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them,\\" ‚Äî Prose shares how she developed her writing craft through writing and reading. She uses examples from literature to demonstrate how fictional elements, such as character and dialogue, can be mastered. ==Summary== * Chapter One: Close Reading Prose discusses the question of whether writing can be taught. She answers the question by suggesting that although writing workshops can be helpful, the best way to learn to write is to read. Closely reading books, Prose studied word choice and sentence construction. Close reading helped her solve difficult obstacles in her own writing. * Chapter Two: Words Prose encourages the reader to slow down and read every word. She reminds the reader that words are the \\"raw material out of which literature is crafted.\\" Challenging the reader to stop at every word, she suggests the following question be asked: \\"What is the writer trying to convey with this word?\\" * Chapter Three: Sentences Prose discusses how \\"the well made sentence transcends time and genre.\\" She believes the writer who is concerned about what constitutes a well-constructed sentence is on the right path. Prose mentions the importance of mastering grammar and how it can improve the quality of a writer's sentence. In this chapter, she also discusses the use of long sentences, short sentences, and rhythm in prose. * Chapter Four: Paragraphs Prose discusses that, just as with sentence construction, the writer who is concerned about paragraph construction is stepping in the right direction. She states that the writer who reads widely will discover there are no general rules for building a well-constructed paragraph, but \\"only individual examples to help point [the writer] in a direction in which [the writer] might want to go.\\" * Chapter Five: Narration When determining point of view, Prose says audience is an important factor. She gives examples from literature of point-of-view variations. First person and third person are discussed, and even an example of writing fiction in second person is given. * Chapter Six: Character Using examples from the works of Heinrich von Kleist and Jane Austen, Prose discusses how writers can develop characterization. She mentions that Kleist, in his \\"The Marquise of O‚Äî\\" ignores physical description of the characters, but instead \\"tells us just as much as we need to know about his characters, then releases them into the narrative that doesn't stop spinning until the last sentence . . .\\" Excerpts from other pieces of literature are used to show how action, dialogue and even physical description can help develop characterization. * Chapter Seven: Dialogue Prose begins this chapter by dispelling the advice that writers should improve and clean up dialogue so it sounds less caustic than actual speech. She believes this idea on dialogue can be taken too far and that dialogue can be used to reveal not only the words on the surface, but the many motivations and emotions of the characters underneath the words. * Chapter Eight: Details Using examples from literature, Prose explains how one or two important details can leave a more memorable impression on the reader than a barrage of description. * Chapter Nine: Gestures Prose argues that gestures performed by fictional characters should not be \\"physical clich√©s\\" but illuminations that move the narrative. * Chapter Ten: Learning from Chekhov Prose gives examples of what she has learned from reading Anton Chekhov. As a creative writing teacher, she would disseminate advice to her students after reading their stories. As a fan of Chekhov, she would read his short stories and find examples of how he would successfully break the \\"rules\\" of fiction writing, contradicting something she recently told her students to do in their writing projects. Prose also discusses how Chekhov teaches the writer to write without judgment; she tells how Chekhov practiced not being the \\"judge of one's characters and their conversations but rather the unbiased observer.\\" * Chapter Eleven: Reading for Courage Prose discusses the fears writers may have: revealing too much of themselves in their writing; resisting the pressures that writers must write a certain way; determining whether or not the act of writing is worth it when one considers the state of the world. She concludes her book by stating that the writer may fear creating \\"weeds\\" instead of \\"roses.\\" Continuing the metaphor, she says reading is a way for the writer to see how other gardeners grow their roses. * Books to Be Read Immediately Prose includes a list of book recommendations, many of which have selections from those that are used as examples for the concepts she discusses. ==Books to be Read== Here are the books in mostly chronological order.

They have been active since 2003, releasing their first album \\"V Gorode N\\" in 2004. Additional musicians have been hired for concerts such as Alexei Ernst - keyboard, Sergey Solodkin - drums, Alexei Kozhakov and Yuri Terletsky (current) - solo guitar. They were nominated in the 2004 Europe MTV Music Awards for Best Russian Group, along with t.A.T.u. and Gorod 312 but lost to Dima Bilan. The group has also contributed to the Romance soundtrack of the 2009 film Female Passenger (Passazhirka). A Russian clipper Dauntless is sailing from San Francisco to Hong Kong. The Russian consul asks the capitan to take a woman passenger on board. A woman on board is a well known sailor curse. This warning is ignored by the main movie characters who welcome the woman. The captain even offers her his own quarters as accommodation during the voyage. They find that they are rather unprepared for what follows. On the album V gorode N, the track \\"Nochnoi Dozor\\" featured as the theme tune to the original Russian cut of the film Night Watch. In addition the track \\"Uma Thurman\\" is a song about how Vladimir has fallen in love with the real Uma Thurman. In the song Uma complains about how Quentin Tarantino was drunk and that she had to reprimand him for his behaviour. Then she tells Vladimir how glad she is that he came. The two never met in real life, before the Kill Bill: Volume 2 premiere in Moscow. The group consists of Dmitry Kozlov, Ruslan Semenov, Yuriy Terletskyy, Vladislav Cherednichenko, Alexey Kaplun, Sergey Solodkin, and Stanislav Veretenov. ==Discography Studio Albums === * 2004 ‚Äî \\"V Gorode N\\" (–í –ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ N; In Unknown City) * 2005 ‚Äî \\"A Mozhet, Eto Son?\\" (–ê –ú–æ–∂–µ—Ç –≠—Ç–æ –°–æ–Ω?; Maybe It's A Dream?) * 2008 ‚Äî \\"Kuda Privodyat Mechty\\" (–ö—É–¥–∞ –ü—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç –ú–µ—á—Ç—ã?; Where Do Dreams Lead You?) * 2009 ‚Äî \\"1825\\" * 2011 ‚Äî \\"V etom gorode vse sumasshedshiye\\" (–í —ç—Ç–æ–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ –≤—Å–µ —Å—É–º–∞—Å—à–µ–¥—à–∏–µ; Everyone Is Mad In This City) * 2016 ‚Äî \\"Poy, vesna!\\" (–ü–æ–π, –≤–µ—Å–Ω–∞!; Sing, Spring!) === Singles === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !

Napoli, 1820, which was based on a drawing by John Izard Middleton. Principles of Geology: being an attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface, by reference to causes now in operation is a book by the Scottish geologist Charles Lyell that was first published in 3 volumes from 1830‚Äì1833. Lyell used the theory of uniformitarianism to describe how the Earth's surface was changing over time. This theory was in direct contrast to the geological theory of catastrophism. Many individuals believed in catastrophism to allow room for religious beliefs. For example, the Genesis flood narrative could be described as a real geological event as catastrophism describes the changing of the Earth surface as one-time, violent events. Lyell challenged the believers of the catastrophic theory by studying Mount Etna in Sicily and describing the changes from one stratum to another and the fossil records within the rocks to posture that slow, gradual changes as the cause of the ever-changing Earth's surface. Lyell used geological observation to interpret that the Earth was older than 6,000 years, as otherwise contested. The book presents that the processes that are occurring in the present are the same processes that occurred in the past.Lyell, Charles. The Principles of Ecology, London: 1833. ==Book== Published in three volumes in 1830‚Äì1833, the book established Lyell's credentials as an important geological theorist and popularized the doctrine of uniformitarianism (first suggested by James Hutton in Theory of the Earth published in 1795). The central argument in Principles was that \\"the present is the key to the past\\": that geological remains from the distant past could, and should, be explained by reference to geological processes now in operation and thus directly observable. The book is notable for being one of the first to use the term \\"evolution\\" in the context of biological speciation.Bower, Peter J. (1975). The Changing Meaning of ‚ÄúEvolution‚Äù. Journal of the History of Ideas 36: 95-114.Richards, R. J. (1992). Evolution. In Evelyn Fox Keller, Elisabeth Lloyd. Keywords in Evolutionary Biology. Cambridge, Massachusetts. pp. 95-105. In Lyell's work, he described the three rules he believes to cause the steady change of the Earth. The first rule is that geologic change comes from slow and continual procedures that have been happening over a long period of time. This rule is the basic ideal of Uniformitarianism and is easy to understand why this was a rule. The second rule is that all the forces that affect the geology of the Earth comes from the Earth. The third rule is that celestial cycles do not impact the patterns of Earth's geologic record. Rule two and rule three go together because Lyell thought that only forces on the Earth cause changes to Earth's geology, and nothing else. Volume 1 introduces Lyell's theory of uniformitarianism. He develops and argues that the earthly processes that we see in the present were the same processes as in the past and caused the Earth to look like it does today. Volume 2 builds off of the uniformitarianism theory in volume 1, but focuses more on the organic matter rather than the inorganic matter. This volume is what Darwin took with him on his voyage on the Beagle. In the 3rd volume, Lyell identifies four periods of the Tertiary: Newer Pliocene, Older Pliocene, Miocene, and the Eocene. Lyell used deposits and fossils from these periods to argue for uniformity during the Tertiary. This also talks about the grammar or syntax of the processes that occurred in the past in today's language. A map of isothermal lines across North America from Lyell's Principles of Geology ==Influence== Lyell's interpretation of geologic change as the steady accumulation of minute changes over enormously long spans of time, a central theme in the Principles, influenced the 22-year- old Charles Darwin, who was given the first volume of the first edition by Robert FitzRoy, captain of HMS Beagle, just before they set out (December 1831) on the ship's second voyage. On their first stop ashore at St Jago, Darwin found rock formations which‚Äîseen \\"through Lyell's eyes\\"‚Äîgave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, an insight he applied throughout his travels. While in South America, Darwin received the second volume, which rejected the idea of organic evolution, proposing \\"Centres of Creation\\" to explain diversity and territory of species. Darwin's ideas gradually moved beyond this, but in geology he operated very much as Lyell's disciple and sent home extensive evidence and theorizing supporting Lyell's uniformitarianism, including Darwin's ideas about the formation of atolls. ==Criticism== Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology was met with a lot of criticism when it was first published. The main argument against Lyell is that he took an a priori approach in his work. This means that Lyell was pulling from a theoretical idea instead of pulling from empirical evidence to explain what was occurring in the geological world. One opponent of Principles of Geology that agreed with this point was Adam Sedgwick. This opposition from Sedgwick comes from his thinking that evidence is all that is needed to support an idea, and that the evidence of geologic events points to a catastrophic event. The criticism of Lyell and his work continued into the 20th century. These arguments agreed with the a priori argument, but continued on to say that Lyell combined the empirical evidence with the scientific explanation of geology that was accepted at the time. The a priori argument is not the only argument that Lyell faced for his work. In 1812, Baron Georges Cuvier argued against uniformitarianism with the results of his study of the Paris Basin. Cuvier and his colleagues found long periods of consistent change with intermittent patterns of sudden fossil disappearance in the geologic record for the area, which is now known as mass extinction. Cuvier explained these sudden changes in the geologic record with catastrophic forces. Lyell responded to this argument, stating that the geologic record was \\"grossly imperfect\\" and that observations cannot be trusted if they go against \\"the plan of Nature\\". In recent years, geologists have begun to question the laws of uniformitarianism Lyell laid out. There is now clear evidence of catastrophic change caused by volcanic eruptions, large earthquakes, and asteroid impacts. Moreover, there is evidence that certain cataclysmic occurrences that left marks in the geological and fossil records may correspond to the periodicity of the Solar System's 26-million-year cycle of movement around the galactic core of the Milky Way. Even if catastrophes are rare, their magnitude may affect geology more than has been appreciated under Lyell's version of uniformitarianism. ==Bibliography== * 1st edition, London: John Murray.

He is a former junior world champion in the team sprint and twice European under 23 champion, as well as a seven-time world champion and a holder of two world records. In 2014 he became the first track cyclist to win three individual world titles at one championship, in the keirin, 1 km and sprint. ==Biography== Pervis joined his first cycling club, the V√©loce Club de Ch√¢teau Gontier, in 1996. He dabbled in road, mountain biking, cyclo-cross and track cycling as a youngster and began concentrating on the track as a junior rider. He went on to win the silver medal as part of the team sprint squad at the 2001 Junior UCI Track World Championships. He bettered that in 2002 when he took the gold medal in the same event and added a silver in the sprint. In 2003, he was a member of the gold medal-winning team sprint squad at the Under 23 European Track Championships, and won the U23 Sprint at the French National Track Championships, and finished second in the U23 Kilo. Pervis competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, finishing sixth in the Kilo. He also won the kilo at the Under 23 European Track Championships, came second in the U23 Sprint National Championships and was third in the team sprint at the World Cup in Manchester. 2005 saw Pervis take his first senior French National Championship title, winning the kilo, and coming second in the U23 sprint. Pervis successfully defended his French National Championship title in the kilo in 2006, also winning the U23 sprint title and coming second in the team sprint. He won a handful of medals in the World Cup events in Los Angeles and Sydney as well as two silver medals in the kilo and team sprint at the Under 23 European Track Championships. He also claimed the bronze medal at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. He was again the senior French National Champion in 2007, beating Didier Henriette to take his third consecutive kilo title, and also taking the bronze medal in the keirin. He won the silver medal in the kilo at the 2007 UCI Track World Championships, and won several medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics in Los Angeles, Manchester and Beijing. Pervis also finished second in the Sprint Omnium at the European Track Championships in Alkmaar 2008 brought more victories for Pervis in the World Cup events in Los Angeles and Ballerup. He took the bronze medal this time round at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships. He served as a substitute for the team sprint, representing France once again at the 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, but did not ride. His teammates went on to take the silver medal. Pervis set a new world record time in the kilometre time trial at a UCI Track Cycling World Cup event on 7 December 2013. At the Aguascalientes velodrome in Mexico he beat the previous world record by over two and a half seconds to record a time of 56.303. ==Personal life== He lives in Yvelines in France and in Japan. Since 2010 he spends the April‚ÄìAugust period of every year in Japan, where he has a contract for the international keirin track racing season. After being not selected for the 2012 Olympics he went into depression, and recovered with the help of mental trainer and former football coach Denis Troch.Fracois Pervis. nbcolympics.com ==Palmar√®s== ;2001 :2nd Junior UCI Track World Championships (Team sprint) ;2002 :1st 20px Junior UCI Track World Championships (Team Sprint) :3rd Junior UCI Track World Championships (Individual Sprint) ;2003 :1st 20px U23 European Track Championships (Team Sprint) :1st 20px U23 French National Track Championships (Individual Sprint) :2nd U23 French National Track Championships (Kilo) ;2004 :1st 20px U23 European Track Championships (Kilo) :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships (U23) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Manchester (Team Sprint) ;2005 :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Kilo) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Sydney (Team sprint) :2nd U23 French National Track Championships (Individual Sprint) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Sydney (Kilo) ;2006 :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Kilo) :1st 20px U23 French National Track Championships (Individual Sprint) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Los Angeles (Team sprint) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Sydney (Kilo) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Sydney (Team sprint) :2nd U23 European Track Championships (Kilo) :2nd U23 European Track Championships (Team sprint) :2nd French National Track Championships (Team sprint) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Los Angeles (Kilo) ;2007 :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Kilo) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Los Angeles (Kilo) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Beijing (Kilo) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Los Angeles (Team Sprint) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Manchester (Kilo) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Beijing (Team Sprint) :2nd European Track Championships (Individual Sprint) :3rd French National Track Championships (Keirin) ;2008 :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Ballerup (Team Sprint with Gr√©gory Baug√© & K√©vin Sireau) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Ballerup (Kilo) :2nd UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Los Angeles (Team Sprint) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) ;2009 :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Kilo) ;2013 :1st UCI Track Cycling World Ranking (Kilo) :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) :2nd European Track Championships (Team Sprint with Gr√©gory Baug√© and Micha√´l D'Almeida) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Individual Sprint) :3rd UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Team Sprint with Julien Palma and Micha√´l D'Almeida) :3rd European Track Championships (Keirin) ;2014 :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Keirin) :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Individual Sprint) :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Kilo) :1st 20px French National Track Championships (Keirin) ;2015 :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Keirin) :1st 20px UCI Track Cycling World Championships (Kilo) :1st UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ‚Äì Cali (Team Sprint with Gr√©gory Baug√© & Quentin Lafargue) :1st Anadia (Individual Sprint) ==ReferencesCategory:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ch√¢teau- Gontier Category:French male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of France Category:UCI Track Cycling World Champions (men) Category:Olympic bronze medalists for France Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:French track cyclists Category:Sportspeople from Mayenne ","title":"Fran√ßois Pervis"},{"id":"9144756","text":"150 Mile House (also referred to as \\"the 50\\") is an unincorporated community of 893 people in the Cariboo region of British Columbia.

Located in Kiruna, in Swedish Lapland, Spaceport Sweden is being developed at Kiruna Airport which will be a hybrid for air and space travel as well as learning adventures, education and research. Swedish Minister for Enterprise and Communication Maud Olofsson inaugurated the project as a national initiative in 2007. The current CEO of the spaceport is Karin Nilsdotter. ==History== The official inauguration of the company was made on 26 January 2007 and the company started off by signing an agreement with Virgin Galactic. The agreement stated that the two would be working together towards an operational agreement whereby Spaceport Sweden would be the first spaceport outside the United States which Virgin Galactic could use for flight campaigns. On 3 April 2008, a press conference was held in Kiruna, and a number of astronauts in training were presented to the press, but details of an agreement, if any, were not released. In February 2012, Spaceport Sweden hoped to have operational flights of SpaceShipTwo by 2015. In 2012, Spaceport Sweden launched an initiative to offer learning adventures and spaceflight preparation providing the opportunity to explore more about the aurora borealis through northern light flights in Kiruna. Further, in collaboration with QinetiQ, a 2-day spaceflight preparation program is provided using a long-arm centrifuge and hypobaric chamber to simulate and prepare for the upcoming spaceflights. In 2013, Spaceport Sweden initiated a limited offering of weightless flight experiences, in collaboration with AirZeroG and Novespace in France, to private individuals using a specially outfitted Airbus A300 capable of simulating a short-duration zero-gravity environment. In 2015 Spaceport Sweden won a Kiruna Lapland Award for the efforts to establish commercial spaceflight in Kiruna, in Swedish Lapland. == See also == *List of Spaceports *Virgin Galactic *Space tourism *Suborbital spaceflight ==Notes== == External links == * Sweden Category:Kiruna Category:Scaled Composites Category:Virgin Galactic Category:Swedish companies established in 2007 ","title":"Spaceport Sweden"},{"id":"9144805","text":"Arty McGlynn (7 August 1944 ‚Äì 18 December 2019) was an Irish guitarist born in Omagh, County Tyrone.

The plane crashed into the bridge of the LST, instantly killing many of the navy personnel on board. The LST floundered and a first attempt at rescue was abandoned for fear of an explosion. Eventually many of the survivors were rescued by the crew of the destroyer . The ship was struck from the Navy list on 19 January 1945. LST-749 earned one battle star for World War II service.

It took place at the Est√°dio Nacional in Lisbon, Portugal on 25 May 1967 in front of a crowd of 45,000. It was the final of the 1966‚Äì67 European Cup, the premier club competition in Europe. The match was Celtic's first European final and Inter's third; they had won the tournament in two of the previous three years. Both teams had to go through four qualifying rounds to get the final. Celtic won their first two ties comfortably, with their second two rounds being tighter. Inter's first tie was very close but they won their next two by bigger margins. In the semi-final, Inter needed a replay to win the tie. Inter scored after seven minutes, when Sandro Mazzola converted a penalty. Celtic equalised through Tommy Gemmell after he scored on 63 minutes. Stevie Chalmers then put Celtic in the lead after 84 minutes. The match finished 2‚Äì1 to Celtic. It was said to be a victory for football because Celtic's attacking football overcame Inter's catenaccio defensive style, which was considered to be a less attractive way to play the game. Celtic's manager Jock Stein and the team received acclaim after the match and were given the nickname the Lisbon Lions; considered to be the greatest side in the club's history. ==Route to the finalCeltic=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;margin- left:1em;float:right\\" - !scope=col width=\\"25\\"Round !scope=col width=\\"100\\"Opponents !scope=col width=\\"50\\"First leg !scope=col width=\\"50\\"Second leg !scope=col width=\\"50\\"Aggregate score - !scope=row First round  Z√ºrich 2‚Äì0 (h) 3‚Äì0 (a) 5‚Äì0 - !scope=row Second round  Nantes 3‚Äì1 (a) 3‚Äì1 (h) 6‚Äì2 - !scope=row Quarter-finals  Vojvodina 0‚Äì1 (a) 2‚Äì0 (h) 2‚Äì1 - !scope=row Semi-finals  Dukla Prague 3‚Äì1 (h) 0‚Äì0 (a) 3‚Äì1 } Celtic qualified for the European Cup after winning the 1965‚Äì66 Scottish Division One, their 21st title, by two points over rivals Rangers.

The match was won 1‚Äì0 by Inter, thanks to a goal from Cappellini, sealing their place in the final. ==MatchBackground=== The final was held in the Est√°dio Nacional, Lisbon Inter had won the European Cup in two of the previous three seasons, 1964 and 1965. Pre-match talk focused on Inter winning a famous tripletta of European Cups and they were considered strong favourites going into the game. Inter were very well known for using a defensive tactic, the Catenaccio, which meant that they won many matches by slim scorelines and rarely conceded. Their manager, Helenio Herrera, was the highest paid in Europe and was considered to be the catalyst of their success. By contrast Celtic were an attacking team. Before the match their manager Jock Stein said that, \\"Celtic will be the first team to bring the European Cup back to Britain... we are going to attack as we have never attacked before,\\" One of Celtic's most important players, striker Joe McBride was to miss the match. He had suffered a long-term knee injury and his last match of the season was on 24 December 1966. McBride would definitely have played had he been fit. He was in such good form for Celtic that, despite missing half the season, McBride finished as the top scorer in Scotland that year with 35 goals in 26 appearances. Inter's most important player, spanish international and Ballon d'Or winner Luis Suarez, missed the match with an injury. He was replaced by veteran Mauro Bicicli, a player with very few appearances in the season, and the loss of their star in the middle of the field would prove decisive in shaping Inter's destiny in the match. Both Inter and Celtic had been performing well domestically throughout the season. Only a few days before the final Inter had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was the last chance for them to redeem what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the Scottish Division One, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season. ===Summary=== Inter had the first attack of the match, with Renato Cappellini running down the wing and supplying a cross to Sandro Mazzola whose header hit Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson's knees. Inter won a penalty minutes later when Jim Craig fouled Cappellini in the box, and Mazzola converted to put Inter in front after only six minutes. Once they had taken the lead, Inter retreated back into their defensive style, which allowed Celtic to attack. However, they struggled to get through Inter's defensive wall and were mainly restricted to long shots from outside the box. Bertie Auld hit the crossbar, then a cross from Jimmy Johnstone was gathered up by Giuliano Sarti, who then tipped a header from the same player over the crossbar. Inter pulled nine men back, but Celtic kept attacking them. Tommy Gemmell's dangerous free-kick was saved by Sarti, he then speculatively attempted to lob the Inter 'keeper and hit the bar. Despite Celtic's inability to break through their opponents defence they were in complete control of the match and Inter were not able to attack. Inter had not had another chance since their goal, whilst Celtic found themselves foiled time and again by outstanding goalkeeping from Sarti. After just over an hour, Gemmell finally managed to equalise for Celtic when Craig passed to him from the right wing and he scored with a powerful 25 yard shot. The balance of play remained the same with Inter defending deeply against sustained Celtic attacking. With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti ‚Äì rather than an instinctive intervention, Chalmers and his teammates asserted that they had practiced the same move many times in training.The Winning Touch: My Autobiography, Stevie Chalmers, Graham McColl; Hachette UK, 2012; This proved to be the winning goal.The Day Lisbon Belonged to Celtic, Stuart Spencer, Scottish Football Museum, 25 May 2017 ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\" { style=\\"font- size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Ronnie Simpson - RB 2  Jim Craig - CB 5  Billy McNeill (c) - CB 6  John Clark - LB 3  Tommy Gemmell - CM 4  Bobby Murdoch - CM 10 Bertie Auld - RW 7  Jimmy Johnstone - CF 9  Stevie Chalmers - CF 8  Willie Wallace - LW 11 Bobby Lennox - colspan=3Substitute: - GK 12 John Fallon - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Jock Stein } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%; margin: auto;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  Giuliano Sarti - SW 6  Armando Picchi (c) - RB 2  Tarcisio Burgnich - CB 5  Aristide Guarneri - LB 3  Giacinto Facchetti - CM 4  Gianfranco Bedin - CM 8  Sandro Mazzola - CM 10 Mauro Bicicli - RW 7  Angelo Domenghini - CF 9  Renato Cappellini - LW 11 Mario Corso - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Helenio Herrera } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Rudibert Jacobi (West Germany) Rudolf Eisemann (West Germany) } ==Post-match== After the final whistle, there was a pitch invasion by Celtic fans, which meant that the Celtic team could not be presented the trophy on the pitch. Some of the Celtic players also had their shirts taken by Celtic supporters. Celtic captain Billy McNeill had to be ushered around the outside of the stadium under armed guards to receive the trophy on a podium in the stand. Inter's loss in the final is considered to be the downfall of \\"La Grande Inter\\", the greatest period of success in the club's history. They had been one of the top teams in Europe for the previous three years, however, failed to recover from their bad season in which they lost out to Celtic as well as in their two domestic competitions. They finished the following season trophyless again and Helenio Herrera, the manager who was considered to be the catalyst of their success, then left the club. Celtic's attacking style play against Inter's catenaccio was heralded as a win for football. Inter manager Helenio Herrera said that \\"We can have no complaints. Celtic deserved their victory. We were beaten by Celtic's force. Although we lost, the match was a victory for sport.\\" while one Portuguese official said \\"This attacking play, this is the real meaning of football. This is the true game.\\". The Portuguese newspaper, Mundo Desportivo, said \\"It was inevitable. Sooner or later the Inter of Herrera, the Inter of catenaccio, of negative football, of marginal victories, had to pay for their refusal to play entertaining football.\\" Celtic manager Jock Stein received widespread praise following the final. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly said to him after the match, \\"John, you're immortal now\\". Since the match a stand has been named after him at Celtic Park and he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Stein is considered by many, including Alex Ferguson, to be the greatest ever Scottish manager, with his victory in the final being one of the main reasons for this. The Celtic team from that year has also received much recognition. They have become known as the Lisbon Lions and are widely considered the greatest team in Celtic's history. All of Celtic's players were born within a 30-mile radius of Glasgow. In 2000, Celtic named a stand at Celtic Park after the Lisbon Lions. They also won the BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award in 1967. ==See also== *1966‚Äì67 European Cup *1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final *1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final *Celtic F.C. in European football *Inter Milan in European football ==References== ==External links== *Video highlights from official Path√© News archive Final European Cup Final 1967 1967 European Cup Final 1967 Category:UEFA Champions League Finals Euro European Cup Final European Cup Final European Cup Final Category:Sports competitions in Lisbon Category:1960s in Lisbon ","title":"1967 European Cup Final"},{"id":"9144917","text":"The Wattenbach or Wattenerbach is a river of Tyrol, Austria, a tributary of the Inn.

He hitchhikes to his childhood home, a decrepit place now owned by Jeremiah (Burt Mustin). Run down as it is, it is the dream home for Wes Merritt (Arthur Kennedy) and his wife Louise (Susan Hayward). They are painstakingly saving up the money to buy it from Wes's meager wages as a cowhand. Wes recognizes Jeff as a once-prominent rodeo rider, and introduces himself, then helps Jeff gets a job at the same ranch. Wes has competed in some local rodeos, but has the ambition to do more, and wants Jeff to help him improve his skills. Wes enters a local rodeo behind his wife's back. When he does well, he decides to join the rodeo circuit, with Jeff as his partner and trainer. Louise is wholeheartedly against the idea, but goes along. She makes her husband promise to quit once they have saved enough for the house. As Louise becomes acquainted with rodeo life, she becomes more and more disenchanted. Jeff's friend Booker Davis (Arthur Hunnicutt), once a champion competitor himself, is now a crippled old man with little to show for his efforts. When Buster Burgess (Walter Coy) is gored and killed by a bull, leaving a bitter widow (Lorna Thayer), Louise can no longer bear to watch her husband compete. However, Wes is seduced by his great success and the money he is winning. He refuses to quit when they have enough for the house. Matters come to a head when Babs (Eleanor Todd) invites Wes to a party she is throwing and makes a play for him. Louise fights back by putting on her only good dress and going to the party with Jeff. She pours a drink on her rival's head before leaving. In the hallway, Jeff asks her if she could love another man, but she is true to Wes. Coming on the tail end of the conversation, Wes tells Jeff that he is tired of taking all the risks and giving him half the prize money. Jeff decides to go back to the rodeo, despite not being in shape. He gains back Wes's respect by doing well. Then, in the bronc riding event, his foot gets stuck in the stirrup after a successful ride, and he is fatally injured. Seeing this, Wes comes to his senses and quits. ==Cast== Susan Hayward in the film's trailer. * Susan Hayward as Louise Merritt * Robert Mitchum as Jeff McCloud * Arthur Kennedy as Wes Merritt * Arthur Hunnicutt as Booker Davis * Frank Faylen as Al Dawson * Walter Coy as Buster Burgess * Carol Nugent as Rusty Davis, Booker's teenage daughter * Maria Hart as Rosemary Maddox * Lorna Thayer as Grace Burgess * Burt Mustin as Jeremiah * Karen King as Ginny Logan, Red's wife * Jimmy Dodd as Red Logan, another rodeo competitor * Eleanor Todd as Babs * Riley Hill as Hoag == Critical reception == This film currently holds 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with the average 8.2/10.

Tekkan not only introduced Morita to Soseki, but also introduced him to the famous feminist activist and author Hiratsuka Raicho. Morita won critical acclaim and acceptance as a serious writer with his novel Baien (Smoke, 1909), a largely autobiographical account of his unhappy marriage, subsequent affair with Hiratsuka Raicho, and their unsuccessful attempt to commit double suicide in Nasushiobara, Tochigi. The novel appeared in serialized format in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. From 1920-1930, Morita taught as a professor of English literature at Hosei University. During this time, he published a large biography of Natsume S≈çseki, and the novel Rinmei (Reincarnation, 1923‚Äì1925). His house in Setagaya, Tokyo was destroyed during the bombing of Tokyo in World War II, and he relocated to Iida, Nagano for the remainder of the war.

It is often thought of as one of the most significant and well-known patterns in the history of the U.S. Mint. The basic design, featuring Liberty on the obverse, was slightly modified from the similar $20 \\"Liberty Head\\" Double Eagle, which was designed by James B. Longacre and minted from 1849 to 1907.

The Half Union was never released for circulation. Some Half Unions can have a somewhat smaller or larger head than others. ==History== In 1877, famed Chief Engraver of the Mint at the time, William Barber, designed the coin. William Barber also designed several other coins, such as the \\"Amazonian Quarter\\" pattern, the short-lived Twenty Cent Piece, and the Trade Dollar. The coin was designed to weigh roughly 2.5 ounces and be made of solid gold. Had it been made for circulation with the general public, the coin would have been the highest valued gold coin ever made at the time, with a face value of fifty dollars.

The first English language edition, released in 2005 by Tor Books, features a foreword by Orson Scott Card. The book is set on a planet whose sole industry is weaving elaborate rugs. The carpets are made of human hair and require a lifetime of work to complete. The book is a series of inter-related stories that give increasingly more detail on the nature and purpose of the rugs and why the universe has tens of thousands of planets solely devoted to making such a thing, each thinking they are the only one. There is a prequel to The Carpet Makers titled Quest (2001), which has not been translated into English so far. ==Plot== The first chapter, originally a short story, uses the family of one carpet-maker to describe the generations-long tradition of hair carpet- making on an unnamed world and how it was based on religious devotion to a distant, and seemingly immortal, Emperor. The next several chapters describe more of the carpet-making culture from the viewpoints of a carpet buyer, a teacher with religious doubts, another carpet maker, a traveling peddler and a tax collector. Some of them are aware of rumours that the reign of the Emperor may be at an end after tens of thousands of years. As the story expands beyond one planet, we learn that a rebellion has in fact overthrown the central government and killed the Emperor and is bringing the news to the galactic region which includes the carpet-makers---a region that seems to have been removed from all official records. The rebel leader who killed the Emperor has a secret: the rebels' success and the Emperor's death were planned by the Emperor himself, grown weary of his long life. Meanwhile, a distant space station near a black hole continues to serve as a delivery point for all the hair carpets, which come from not only one world, but more than ten thousand. In an isolated bubble of space, removed from all the other stars of the galaxy, a lone planet is, over millennia, being paved flat. Only an ancient palace remains and, within it, a captive former king kept alive by artificial means is forced to watch the destruction of his world. The rebel leaders are astonished to learn that all the hair carpets have been sent through a hidden portal to this world and now cover most of its surface. Back at the Imperial Archives, the still-loyal Archivist finally tells the ancient story: the conquered king had teased the Emperor's predecessor about being unable to grow hair on his head, so in vengeance the old Emperor had decided to cover his enemy's entire planet with the hair of his former subjects, a plan which the next Emperor had allowed to continue for 100,000 years. ==Reception== The original German novel won the 1996 Deutscher Science Fiction Preis as well as the Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire for foreign-language novel in 2001.

The word \\"science\\" comes from the Latin word \\"scientia\\" meaning knowledge. A practitioner of science is called a \\"scientist\\". Modern science respects objective logical reasoning, and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it. Some scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through research policies. These procedures are known as the scientific method. == Essence of science == * Research ‚Äì systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge. * Scientific discovery ‚Äì observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences. * Laboratory ‚Äì facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be performed. * Objectivity ‚Äì the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc. * Inquiry ‚Äì any process that has the aim of augmenting knowledge, resolving doubt, or solving a problem. == Scientific method == Scientific method (outline) ‚Äì body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive. * Empirical method ‚Äì * Experimental method ‚Äì The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include: *# Conducting initial research and asking a question about a natural phenomenon *# Making observations of the phenomenon and/or collecting data about it *# Forming a hypothesis ‚Äì proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. *# Predicting a logical consequence of the hypothesis *# Testing the hypothesis through an experiment ‚Äì methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are: *#* Controlled experiment ‚Äì experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable). *#* Natural experiment ‚Äì empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment. *#** Observational study ‚Äì draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator. *#* Field experiment ‚Äì applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. See also field research. *# Gather and analyze data from experiments or observations, including indicators of uncertainty. *# Draw conclusions by comparing data with predictions. Possible outcomes: *#* Conclusive: *#** The hypothesis is falsified by the data. *#** Data are consistent with the hypothesis. *#** Data are consistent with alternative hypotheses. *#* Inconclusive: *#** Data are not relevant to the hypothesis, or data and predictions are incommensurate. *#** There is too much uncertainty in the data to draw any conclusion. *# Further steps include peer review and enabling others to reproduce or falsify the observations and/or conclusions * Deductive-nomological model * Scientific modelling ‚Äì * Models of scientific method ** Hypothetico-deductive model ‚Äì proposed description of scientific method. According to it, scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a hypothesis in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data. A test that could and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis. A test that could but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory. == Branches of science == Branches of science ‚Äì divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned, which typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. === Formal science === Formal science ‚Äì branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems, such as those under the branches of: logic, mathematics, computer science, statistics, and some aspects of linguistics. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world, but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules. * Branches of formal science (also known as the formal sciences) === Natural science === Natural science (outline) ‚Äì major branch of science, that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are among the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main branches: biology, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences. * Branches of natural science (also known as the natural sciences) === Social science === Social science ‚Äì study of the social world constructed between humans. The social sciences usually limit themselves to an anthropomorphically centric view of these interactions with minimal emphasis on the inadvertent impact of social human behavior on the external environment (physical, biological, ecological, etc.). 'Social' is the concept of exchange/influence of ideas, thoughts, and relationship interactions (resulting in harmony, peace, self enrichment, favoritism, maliciousness, justice seeking, etc.) between humans. The scientific method is utilized in many social sciences, albeit adapted to the needs of the social construct being studied. * Branches of social science (also known as the social sciences) === Applied science === Applied science ‚Äì branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, including inventions and other technological advancements. * Branches of applied science (also known as the applied sciences) == Types of scientific fields == * Exact science ‚Äì any field of science capable of accurate quantitative expression or precise predictions and rigorous methods of testing hypotheses, especially reproducible experiments involving quantifiable predictions and measurements. * Fundamental science ‚Äì science that describes the most basic objects, forces, relations between them and laws governing them, such that all other phenomena may be in principle derived from them following the logic of scientific reductionism. * Hard and soft science ‚Äì colloquial terms often used when comparing scientific fields of academic research or scholarship, with hard meaning perceived as being more scientific, rigorous, or accurate. == Politics of science == * Disruptive technology ‚Äì innovation that helps create a new market and value network, and eventually goes on to disrupt an existing market and value network (over a few years or decades), displacing an earlier technology. * Kansas evolution hearings ‚Äì series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, United States 5 to 12 May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education and its State Board Science Hearing Committee to change how evolution and the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. * List of books about the politics of science ‚Äì list of books about the politics of science. * Politicization of science ‚Äì politicization of science is the manipulation of science for political gain. * Science by press release ‚Äì refers to scientists who put an unusual focus on publicizing results of research in the media. == History of science == * History of science ‚Äì history of science in general ** History of scientific method ‚Äì history of scientific method is a history of the methodology of scientific inquiry, as differentiated from a history of science in general. ** Theories/sociology of science ‚Äì sociology and philosophy of science, as well as the entire field of science studies, have in the 20th century been occupied with the question of large-scale patterns and trends in the development of science, and asking questions about how science \\"works\\" both in a philosophical and practical sense. ** Historiography ‚Äì study of the history and methodology of the sub- discipline of history, known as the history of science, including its disciplinary aspects and practices (methods, theories, schools) and to the study of its own historical development (\\"History of History of Science\\", i.e., the history of the discipline called History of Science). ** History of pseudoscience ‚Äì history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time.

Until recently her main role in DC Universe history has been as a body occupied by the Ultra-Humanite in the 1940s, but she has made more significant appearances in current continuity. ==History== In the early 1940s Delores was a rare beauty ‚àí a rising star on the silver screen who might have been legend with just a few more well-chosen parts. She had had a sexual indiscretion while simply an aspiring actress but did not choose an abortion, instead, she had given birth to a healthy daughter and had given her up, she then commenced her career in earnest. Her last Hollywood project was the 12-part serial produced by Stellar Pictures, Monkey Trouble, where she co-starred with Garrett Fairfield. She was kidnapped by the Ultra-Humanite for the purpose of a body swap. Brain surgery was undertaken and the villain's brain was placed into the cranium of the actress. The Ultra-Humanite did not give the real Delores Winters a second thought, he simply cast her aside and continued with his own maniacal designs which included gathering together powerful talismans, capturing the Justice Society of America, and ruling the world; of the last goal, at least, he was unsuccessful. Pre-Crisis the Ultra-Humanite claimed to be retiring, but took a group of celebrities on the ship Sea Serpent hostage, asking for a ransom of $5,000,000. However Superman rescued them, though Ultra escaped. All who knew of Miss Winters' abduction believed her dead. The truth, however, was that the mad scientist who assisted the megalomaniacal genius had other plans for the actress. He had seen all of the actress' movies and thought of himself as a fan, and so he preserved her brain as only he knew how, and sought out a new body for her. He found one in a recent suicide at Our Lady of Snows' General Hospital. The reaction of the \\"saved\\" Miss Winters was far from grateful. She asked for death or for a prettier body. Whether Dolores Winters had always been vain is not recorded, perhaps the cause of her callous disregard for her new body and that of others was simply the result of the shock of having her brain, and her essence, taken forcibly out of her own body and placed into that of a stranger. Regardless, she regained her life with a great sense of loss - of her identity, of the life she felt she deserved - and with the aid of Doctor Marten, she began a series of surgeries aimed at taking the ugly body of the suicide and transforming it into something beautiful. Delores Winters became intimate with reconstructive surgery and though it was painful she was a woman with a driven obsession. Yet all bodies age, even reconstructed ones. Sometime in the 1950s or 1960s Miss Winters had Doctor Marten locate and abduct her daughter, now a young and beautiful woman. Delores had her brain transplanted, and it was her daughter this time who was cast aside and left to die. She continued to have cosmetic surgeries as she lived her life of ease and wealth. Some time during the 2000s, however, she decided to repair her aging skin by having a full transplant - and as a donor she chose the heroine Icemaiden. She paid Warp to kidnap Icemaiden and then had Doctor Marten conduct the surgery. In the end Delores Winters had new alabaster skin while the heroine had been flayed alive. Icemaiden did not die, however, and eventually was placed, comatose, into a hydration womb within a facility of S.T.A.R. Labs. By the 2000s Delores Winters was owner and operator of a spa/clinic that specialized in cosmetic surgeries, she was also calling herself Endless Winter. Covertly she worked with Roulette, another businesswoman who just happened to specialize in fight club gambling - with the fighters being heroes forced into knock-down, drag- out, kill-or-be-killed matches. The losers of these brutal fights would be given over to Winters and her doctors, their body parts would be sold to and implanted into clients who bought into the lure of youth, vitality, and that little extra rush of power that comes from being a metahuman. Her clinic was infiltrated by Dr. Mid-Nite who was then captured. He escaped, however, and went after Winters. In the ensuing fight the clinic and spa was damaged while Delores Winters lost control of her own metahuman skin. She began causing snow and ice to form and blow within the confines of the clinic and even began freezing over her own body. In the battle with Dr. Mid-Nite her right arm from the elbow down was snapped off, but she escapes into the night. Some time later, Delores travels to Gotham City and attacks Batwoman. After she is defeated, Delores suddenly collapses and dies from an unknown cause. Her corpse is taken by the Justice League and it is revealed that she had been forced by Prometheus to attack Batwoman in order to distract her from his true goal. Despite the injury suffered at Mid-Nite's hands, Delores still appears having both her arms intact. ==Powers== Delores Winters has recently had a complete skin graft from the heroine Icemaiden (herself a product of scientific genetic tinkering). This skin has the ability to manipulate moisture and temperature so as to create ice and cold. Miss Winters has had no training in the use of these powers and she cannot control them to any degree. It also appears she has had no great training in defensive or offensive tactics, and her only other well-known trait is that of being a businesswoman and entrepreneur. Though not technically a power, she has in her employ the physician she calls Marten (brain surgeon and former assistant of the Ultra- Humanite) and she has undergone, at least twice, a brain transfer. This medical procedure has allowed Miss Winters, born sometime before the 1940s, to remain in physically young bodies. ==Legends of the DC Universe== An actress named Delores Winters appeared as the girlfriend of Lex Luthor in post-Crisis continuity. Superman fights a new U.L.T.R.A. Humanite; a scientist who can transfer his consciousness into other bodies and seeks revenge on Luthor. Luthor attempts to kill Winters, believing (wrongly) she has been possessed by the Humanite, but she is saved by Superman.Legends of the DC Universe #1-3 (Jan-Apr 1998) ==References== Category:Characters created by Jerry Siegel Category:Characters created by Joe Shuster Category:Comics characters introduced in 1940 Category:DC Comics characters Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional actors ","title":"Delores Winters"},{"id":"9145286","text":"Joseph Georges Claude Pronovost (born July 22, 1935) is a retired professional ice hockey goaltender who played three games in the National Hockey League.

Feldman, was an American comedic actor and writer best known for his featured role on The Abbott and Costello Show in the 1940s (radio) and early 1950s (television). He was sometimes credited as \\"Sid Fields\\" or \\"Sidney Field\\". ==Biography== Fields was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 5, 1898. He began his career when he was a boy, by working in local theaters. As a teenager, he worked in carnivals and tent shows in the Midwest, and later became partner in a comedy team with vaudeville and burlesque performer Jack Greenman. The team was cast by Harold Minsky in his family's celebrated burlesque theater. The team split up in Hollywood when Fields was hired to work on a feature film with Eddie Cantor, Strike Me Pink (1936). In the ensuing years, Fields performed on stage, radio, and occasionally in movies. He worked on Eddie Cantor's radio show as a writer and actor, and then with Ben Blue, Rudy Vallee, Fred Allen, and Milton Berle. Fields appeared in small roles in 1930s film comedies and sometimes received screen credits as a writer and assistant director. In 1944, he began working with Abbott and Costello, first in the film In Society (1944) and as a writer/performer on their radio series, where he introduced his Professor Melonhead character. From 1951 he supported Abbott and Costello on NBC-TV's The Colgate Comedy Hour, and in 1952, he was cast in the team's filmed series, The Abbott and Costello Show. He also wrote the majority of scripts for the first season. Fields played the hot-tempered, bald-headed landlord of the rooming house where Abbott and Costello lived. He was a frequent target of gags and schemes foisted by the two main characters. Fields played numerous other roles as well, almost always wearing a wig, glasses or other disguise. (These characters were often related to the landlord.) The ensemble cast included Hillary Brooke as a neighbor and love interest of Lou Costello's, Gordon Jones as Mike the Cop, who was a dimwitted comedic foil for the boys, Joe Besser as Stinky Davis, a 40-year-old man dressed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit, and Joe Kirk as Mr. Bacciagalupe, an Italian immigrant caricature who ran a bakery, a record shop, a vegetable stand or some other enterprise, depending on the episode. The show ran for two seasons and played in syndication for decades. After the show ended, Sidney played occasional small roles in television shows, and worked as a staff writer and comedian in Jackie Gleason and His American Scene Magazine. He retired to Las Vegas, where he died of lung cancer, on September 28, 1975, age 77. ==Legacy== Fields, playing his role of Professor Melonhead, performed \\"Who's on First?\\" with Costello on Walgreen's 44th anniversary radio special when Abbott was sick and unable to perform.Fields & Costello routine, from the Walgreens 44th anniversary special (on radio). Jerry Seinfeld, a fan of the comedy team and TV series, volunteered to care for an elderly man named Sid Fields in a 1993 episode of Seinfeld called \\"The Old Man\\".

Its focus on doctrine distinguishes it from Ecumenism. Many of the fastest growing Evangelical churches in the world do not belong to any \\"established\\" denomination, though the tendency is that over time the larger ones form their own organization (typically without calling it a \\"denomination\\"). According to David Barrett,, there are an additional 60 million Americans who are born again believers and do not attend any church. Though this is often due to faults in the church (some cite visionless leadership, unresolved sin issues amongst church bodies, lax morals in the pews, money mishandling, etc. in their reasons for not attending), postdenominationalists consider that the Church is at the center of God's plan for the world. == Common doctrinal points == The following doctrinal points are shared by many who consider themselves postdenominational (Bible references in parentheses): *\\"Church\\" is the convocation, assembly, or congregation of persons, disciples of Christ, saved by faith (not by works nor by membership in a religion), regenerated by the working of the Holy Spirit, who obey the commandments of Jesus Christ and are His Body on Earth.

(I Corinthians 1:2; Acts 9:31, 15:41; 16:5; Romans 16:16) *The message of the true Church is always Christ-centered. **The true Church does not preach itself. **The true Church does not preach a person. (Acts 19:13-16) **The true Church does not preach a denomination. (Acts 5:42) **The true Church does not teach doctrines and traditions of humans. (Matthew 15:3-9; Mark 7:8; Colossians 2:8) *The true Church preaches only the Word of God, the Bible and preaches it in its totality. (Mark 2:2; 16:15; Romans 15:20; II Corinthians 4:5; I Thessalonians 2:9; II Timothy 4:2) *One should distrust anyone who adds to or takes away from the Word of God. (Revelation 22:18-19) *The true Church is the Body of Christ on Earth (I Corinthians 12:12-27; Ephesians 5:23, 29-30) **The members of a body do not choose their position in that body. **If a member becomes separated from the body that it is attached to, it will die, as it has no life in and of itself. The body can continue to function, but with some limitation. **Where one part of the body is, the rest of the body is also. (Acts 10:24, 25) *The true Church is a group of people who know how to praise and worship God in Spirit and in truth.

He was of princely origin as he was seventh in descent from Nath √ç, King of Ireland, who died 428 and a member of the Hy-Fiachrach family from Connacht. His father was Lugna, son of Lugad, son of Finbarr, son of Fraic, son of Cathchuon, son of Aengus Becchuoun, son of Nath √ç son of Fiachrae son of Eochaid Mugmedon. His mother was Dediva (also called Editua or Dedi or Deidi or Deighe or Deidiu or Deaga or Mediva), daughter of Tren, son of Dubhthach moccu Lughair, who was a Chief Ollam of Ireland and royal poet of King L√≥egaire mac N√©ill. Dediva's other children were Saint Senan of Laraghabrine, son of Fintan, Saint Caillin of Fenagh, son of Niata, St.Mainch√≠n of Corann, son of Collan of Corann, Saint Felim of Kilmore son of Carill, Saint Daigh of Inniskeen son of Carill, Saint Femia daughter of Carill and Sench√°n Torp√©ist, a later Chief Ollam of Ireland. Saint Diarmaid was the youngest of Dediva's famous children. About the year 530, he founded the great monastery of Inchcleraun on Lough Ree, in the Diocese of Ardagh. Wishing to found an oratory far from the day-to-day distractions of civilization, he selected the isolated island associated with the memory of Queen Medbh, Inchcleraun. Here his fame soon attracted disciples. He was a good teacher and also a distinguished writer and poet. On the island seven churches are traditionally said to have been erected, and the traces of six are still in evidence, including Teampul Diarmada, or the church of St. Diarmiad. This oratory, eight feet by seven feet, is said to have been Diarmaid's own church. The monastic school he founded kept up its reputation for fully six centuries after his death, and the island itself was famous for pilgrimages in pre-Reformation days. An ivory statue of the saint was removed from the island during the Reformation to avoid destruction. He also founded the monastery of Caille-Fochladha, Lough Derryvaragh, Co Westmeath, where there is a holy well dedicated to him. St. Diarmaid's nickname was 'Diarmaid the Just'; he is sometimes confused with an earlier St. Justus who was both baptizer and teacher of St.Kieran of Clonmacnoise. He was a friend of St. Senan, Abbot of Iniscathy and he composed metrical psalters, among which is \\"Cealtair Dichill\\". He died on 10 January at Inchcleraun and his feast is celebrated on that date.

It connects the eastern district of Friedrichshain with Charlottenburg in the west via 11 intermediate stations including Hauptbahnhof. The Berlin Stadtbahn is often also defined as the slightly longer route between Ostkreuz and Westkreuz, although this is not technically correct. The line was originally built in the 1880s. It is in length, and is entirely elevated above the city's streets. The four track route carries S-Bahn, Regionalbahn, Regional-Express, Intercity, EuroCity and Intercity-Express trains. == Operation  Structure and tracks === The Stadtbahn line is an elevated rail line with viaducts totalling in length and including 731 masonry viaduct arches. A further of the line are situated on 64 bridges, that cross adjoining streets and (three times) the River Spree. The remaining length of the line is on an embankment. The line carries four tracks, in two pairs. The northern pair are reserved for use by the S-Bahn, and are electrified using a third rail carrying 800V DC. The S-Bahn tracks have platforms at all eleven stations along the Stadtbahn. The southern pair of tracks are used by Regionalbahn, Regional-Express, Intercity, EuroCity and Intercity-Express trains, and are electrified using the German standard of 15 kV at 16.7 Hz AC, supplied by overhead line. Six of the Stadtbahn stations have platforms on these tracks, although not all trains stop at all stations, depending on the class and route of the train. === Stations === From east to west, the Stadtbahn has stations at: * Ostbahnhof * Jannowitzbr√ºcke (S-Bahn only) * Alexanderplatz * Hackescher Markt (S-Bahn only) * Friedrichstra√üe * Hauptbahnhof * Bellevue (S-Bahn only) * Tiergarten (S-Bahn only) * Zoologischer Garten * Savignyplatz (S-Bahn only) * Charlottenburg === Routes === The S-Bahn tracks of the Stadtbahn currently carry the following routes (as of September 2018): * (Spandau to Erkner) * (Westkreuz to Strausberg Nord) * (Potsdam Hauptbahnhof to Ahrensfelde) * (Spandau to Sch√∂nefeld Flughafen). The longer distance tracks carry Regionalbahn and Regional-Express routes RE1 (Magdeburg to Eisenh√ºttenstadt), RE2 (Rathenow to Cottbus), RE7 (Dessau to W√ºnsdorf-Waldstadt) and RB14 (Nauen to Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport). Although most InterCity and Intercity-Express trains now use the north-south tunnel route via Hauptbahnhof, some trains do still remain on the Stadtbahn's long distance tracks. These trains, mainly those heading toward Hanover and Cologne, usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. == History  Planning === In 1871, eight main line railways existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge or outside the city limits. This was very impractical for many passengers, who were forced to use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other. In 1872, the Deutsche Eisenbahnbaugesellschaft (German Railway Construction Company - DEG) filed the planning application for a railway line through the city, connecting the then-Schlesischer Bahnhof (today Berlin Ostbahnhof) to Charlottenburg, and continuing to Potsdam. In December 1873, the state of Prussia as well as the private rail enterprises Berlin-Potsdamer Eisenbahn, Magdeburg-Halberst√§dter Eisenbahn and Berlin-Hamburger Bahn bought shares in the DEG, and jointly founded the Berliner Stadteisenbahngesellschaft (Berlin City Railway Company). However, things did not go as expected and the DEG went into bankruptcy in 1878, which forced the Prussian state government to take over operations, pay for the construction of the line with state money and to reimburse the former private owners of the DEG. The state's interest in the line was attributed to the military, which after the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was of the opinion that the railway networks would hinder mobilisation when not properly interconnected. On 15 July 1878 the K√∂nigliche Direktion der Berliner Stadteisenbahn (Royal Directorate of Berlin City Railways), under the management of Ernst Dircksen, was commissioned to manage the site. The directorate at first reported to the Prussian Ministry of Transport and later became a subsidiary of the Ministry of Public Operations. Stadtbahn seen from the Park Inn Berlin, near station Hackescher Markt The planned railway had two tracks each for freight and passenger traffic. Having taken similar projects in London and New York City into consideration, passenger traffic received priority over freight trains. Furthermore, the new railway line was not only to serve as a connection between the mainline termini in Berlin, but would also offer connections to the Berlin Ringbahn and the suburban rail lines. The traffic routing was not only influenced by the location of the already existing stations the line was supposed to connect, but also by land availability in the city centre. One of the original drafts, which called for building the line along Leipziger Stra√üe, had to be scrapped because of overly high land prices. The moat of the 17th century Berlin Fortress was filled up between Hackescher Markt and Jannowitzbr√ºcke stations and, since it was public land, was used for building the railway line. This explains some of the curvy sections on the Stadtbahn, especially between Alexanderplatz and Jannowitzbr√ºcke stations. Berliner Stadteisenbahn: Station Savignyplatz with a Prussian T2 Its elevated nature sets the Stadtbahn apart from the previous Berliner Verbindungsbahn, built in 1851, which was built at street level and was a hindrance to travel. === Construction === Work on the line started in 1875 and the Stadtbahn was opened on 7 February 1882 for local traffic; it opened on 15 May the same year for long-distance trains. The costs of construction, including purchase of the land, were estimated at about 5 million Goldmark per kilometre. The line would later become the core route of the Berlin S-Bahn. The Stadtbahn was originally equipped with longitudinal iron sleepers on the Haarmann system,for details in English, see United States Patent 201,667 of 1878 however these were replaced with wooden sleepers in the early 20th century. The original stations, from west to east, were: * Charlottenburg * Zoologischer Garten * Bellevue * Lehrter Stadtbahnhof (today Berlin Hauptbahnhof) * Friedrichstra√üe * B√∂rse (Marx-Engels-Platz in period of the GDR, and since 1992 Hackescher Markt) * Alexanderplatz * Jannowitzbr√ºcke * Schlesischer Bahnhof (named Berlin Hauptbahnhof in the 1980s and early 90s, today Ostbahnhof) Since 1 May 1888 the Stadtbahn also connected to Stralau- Rummelsburg (Ostkreuz since 1933) in the east and Westend (via Westkreuz) in the west. Two stations were later added * Savignyplatz (1 August 1896) between Charlottenburg and Zoologischer Garten, and * Tiergarten (5 January 1885) between Zoologischer Garten and Bellevue === Initial operation ===  Suburban trains  Suburban trains operated on the local tracks, the so- called city track. At first, these were either services to the suburbs or connections to the Berlin Ringbahn, running as \\"half ring trains\\", using the Stadtbahn and either the northern or the southern Ringbahn. The trains were pulled by locomotives, which ran on coke to minimise the smell. Doors on the train compartments had to be opened by the passengers themselves and stations were not called out on the train. These trains ran from 4 o'clock in the morning to 1 o'clock at night, typically at intervals between two and five minutes, depending on the time of day. Fares in the early 20th century were 10 pfennig in 3rd class and 15 pfennig in 2nd class.  Freight traffic  The freight traffic to the central market at Alexanderplatz was carried by seven special trains per day, of which four ran at night, two during the day and one in the evening. Apart from this, the Stadtbahn carried no freight; normal freight traffic instead used the freight stations Charlottenburg, Moabit, Wedding, Zentralviehhof, Wei√üensee, Frankfurter Allee, Rixdorf, Tempelhof, Wilmersdorf-Friedenau and Halensee on the ring line.  Long- distance trains  In the first years of the Stadtbahn, many trains previously terminating at the old terminuses Lehrter Bahnhof, G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof or Potsdamer Bahnhof operated via the Stadtbahn to reduce the load on the terminus stations. By the end of the 19th century, however, most of these train runs had to terminate at their old destination stations again due to the increasing local traffic on the Stadtbahn. The remaining traffic on the Stadtbahn mostly consisted of express trains to Hanover and Cologne via the Lehrter Bahn, Kanonenbahn trains to Dessau, trains to K√∂nigsberg and Danzig on the Preu√üische Ostbahn and trains to Frankfurt/Oder and Breslau. Suburban trains to Spandau and Strausberg also ran on the Stadtbahn's long-distance tracks until 1928. Trains heading west usually left from the Schlesischer Bahnhof station, those heading east from Charlottenburg. Depots were situated in Rummelsburg (then called Bw Karlshorst) and Grunewald. Station Jannowitzbr√ºcke === Station expansions and viaducts === In 1914, the Friedrichstra√üe station was rebuilt; the long-distance section of the station was expanded to four tracks and the current station hall was built. Between 1922 and 1932, the Stadtbahn viaduct was thoroughly modernised in order to handle the ever-increasing train weight. Also, the train sheds of Alexanderplatz and Schlesischer Bahnhof were replaced. The suburban line's platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres. A second long-distance platform and a new hall were built at Zoo station from 1934 to 1940. The station hall was only glazed in the 1950s, however. The notable terraced vestibule dates from the same time. === Electric operation === The S-Bahn logo. On 11 June 1928 the suburban line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was fully equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains of the new DRG Class ET 165 ‚Äì the type appropriately named Stadtbahn ‚Äì went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Gr√ºnau as well as the Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services. In December 1930 the term S-Bahn and the symbol of a white S on a green circle were introduced for the city, ring and suburban services. === Post-War situation === After World War II, the Stadtbahn lay devastated by bombs, but was rebuilt very quickly. Because Joseph Stalin wanted to travel by train to the Potsdam Conference, the Stadtbahn was converted to the Russian broad gauge in 1945. The national importance had diminished with the loss of eastern Germany; only a few trains ran towards the western zones. Some trains from the Soviet zone terminated on the Stadtbahn. During the Berlin Blockade, the long- distance traffic came to an almost complete halt. The Stadtbahn was useful for the re-established S-Bahn, however, now with connections to places line K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, Strausberg, Staaken and Falkensee. From 18 May 1952, when all Berlin terminal stations and all other long-distance stations in West Berlin were closed, the station Zoologischer Garten remained the only long-distance station for the western part of the city. The last domestic train of the GDR (East German) railways ran on the Stadtbahn in 1953. Transit train at Zoo station 1976 After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West Berlin and Ostbahnhof the East Berlin de facto central station. The station Friedrichstra√üe now was the terminal point of the separated West and East Berlin S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West Berlin and West Germany. Friedrichstra√üe station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-S√ºd-Bahn and the U6 line of the Berlin U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East Berlin. Through trains between Zoo and Ostbahnhof only existed in international traffic, for example the Paris to Warsaw trains. Later, through coaches and shuttle trains connecting to the night trains to Scandinavia crossed the intra-German border on the Stadtbahn as well. Due to a quirk in legislation, the West Berlin parts of the Stadtbahn belonged to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which made it (and therefore the GDR government) one of the largest landowners in West Berlin. Regular quarrels erupted between the DR, the GDR government, the West Berlin Senate and the Allied occupation powers. Prices for the West Berlin S-Bahn were kept slightly below the fares of the West Berlin BVG. In East Berlin, a flat fee of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. West Berlin politics and most of the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by the East German railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn. === Restoration during the Cold War === Despite problems, the Deutsche Reichsbahn made improvements to the line and reconstructed at great expense the Westkreuz railway station which had been built on swamp land. Meanwhile, the number of S-Bahn lines running in West Berlin was reduced to just three as a consequence of a strike carried out by the Deutsche Reichsbahn's West Berlin-based employees in September 1980. On 9 January 1984 a treaty between the GDR and the West Berlin Senate came into force and turned over the responsibility for operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the West Berlin transport authority, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe. Soon thereafter, talks with the GDR commenced regarding improvements of the Stadtbahn in West Berlin as well as the modernisation of the Zoologischer Garten station. The Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was also carefully restored to its original 1880s look and became a listed building. In East Berlin, the Ostbahnhof was partially rebuilt and renamed to Hauptbahnhof, in time for the 750th anniversary of Berlin's founding in 1987. === After reunification === The fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification made for a sudden spike of importance for the Stadtbahn. The first InterRegio train ran to Cologne in 1990. Since 1991, Intercity trains to Karlsruhe, Cologne and Hamburg used the Stadtbahn. The Hamburg line was soon extended to Dresden and Prague, and the former Interzonenzug trains from Munich were converted to InterCity trains and now ran on the Stadtbahn as well. The western part of the Stadtbahn was electrified on 4 July 1993 up to Zoologischer Garten station. The eastern part of the line up to Ostbahnhof had been electrified since 1987. As soon as electrification reached the Zoo station, ICE trains began to use the station. === Modernisation from 1994 === In October 1994 a large-scale modernisation programme was started on the Stadtbahn. The viaducts were checked and strengthened, and the tracks were bedded in concrete to improve durability and comfort. Almost all stations saw large financial investments and were thoroughly modernised. Long-distance traffic between Zoo and Ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during the construction period and the S-Bahn trains temporarily used the long-distance line. On 24 March 1998 the Stadtbahn was reopened, now carrying up to three ICE and IC lines as well as five RegionalExpress lines. Part of the Stadtbahn was realigned as part of the construction of the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof, with construction commencing in 2001 and completed in July 2002. The realigned section consisted of two 450 m-long bridges spanning the station and the adjacent Humboldthafen port. Until the summer of 2006, the Stadtbahn was the main thoroughfare for long-distance trains, which usually stopped at Zoologischer Garten and Ostbahnhof (which was renamed in 1998). When the new Hauptbahnhof opened on 28 May 2006 the importance of the line diminished slightly, as many trains now would use the new north-south line connected to the Hauptbahnhof. The remaining intercity trains on the Stadtbahn, mainly those heading toward Hanover and Cologne, now usually call at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * Category:Railway lines in Berlin Category:Rail transport in Berlin Category:Berlin S-Bahn Category:Standard gauge railways in Germany ","title":"Berlin Stadtbahn"},{"id":"9145644","text":"Sons of Ben may refer to: * Sons of Ben (literary group), term applied to followers of Ben Jonson in English poetry and drama in the first half of the seventeenth century * Sons of Ben (MLS supporters association), a supporters organization for the Philadelphia Union MLS soccer team which began play in 2010 ","title":"Sons of Ben"},{"id":"9145663","text":"Rev. Charles Leach (1 March 1847 ‚Äì 24 November 1919) was a Congregationalist Minister and Liberal Party politician in the United Kingdom. He is notable as the only Member of Parliament to be deprived of his seat after being declared of unsound mind. ==Early life== Leach was born in Illingworth, near Halifax, but moved to the town and grew up in a slum called Ratten Row, where his mother died when he was five.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.11\\" He entered a worsted mill at eight which meant that he also had three hours elementary schooling per day. At fourteen he became apprenticed as a clog and patten maker and then trained as a shoe and bootmaker.\\"The Popular Guide to the House of Commons\\", Pall Mall Gazette Extra, January 1911, p. 173. At nineteen he set up in that trade and on the strength of that married Mary Jane Fox. Moving to Elland near Halifax he built up a successful boot and shoe business, by 1871 employing three men, one woman and two boys.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.32\\" ==Religious training== In Halifax he had become involved with the Methodist New Connexion Church and in Elland became a local preacher for them.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.29\\" Feeling a call to enter the ministry he worked from four to eight in the morning before opening his shop to reach the required educational level. In 1873 the denomination sent him to Sheffield as a 'preacher on trial', with responsibility for Attercliffe chapel, but meanwhile he attended Ranmoor Theological College in the city.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.39\\" After two years in Sheffield, he was sent to the Ladywood mission chapel in Birmingham.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.47\\" ==Professional life== In Birmingham he began his Sunday afternoon lectures which were so popular that after a couple of years he was forced to use the Town Hall as the numbers had become so great. They were at time said to have reached 4000 people.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.71\\" He was ordained into the Methodist New Connexion in 1877.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.57\\" After four years at Ladywood the Methodist New Connexion wanted to send him to London, but a committee was set up to use the redundant Highbury chapel in Graham Street and he was invited to be the pastor and hence he became an Independent or Congregational minister.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.67\\" He ran a very successful chapel for seven years and also became a regular speaker for, and officer in, the Liberal party.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.85\\" In 1884 he was elected to the Birmingham School Board. However, in 1886, when Joseph Chamberlain split the party he sided with Gladstone which left him in a difficult position in Liberal Unionist dominated Birmingham.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.100\\" The upshot was that he left and went to Queen's Park in London, to a church that was still meeting in a hall. In the next few years he raised all the money and got the proper chapel built.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.122\\" In 1888, Leach, who was living in Brondesbury Road, Kilburn, stood as a Progressive candidate in Chelsea division for the London School Board.\\"London School Board election\\", The Times, 3 November 1888. He placed ninth, where there were five seats available. In 1889 he went on a preaching tour to Canada and America where he collected an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Ohio University.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.121\\" Always interested in education he was instrumental in setting up the Queen's Park Institute which used the chapel's school buildings.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.124\\" In 1892 he was elected to Chelsea Vestry.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.128\\" By 1894 he was despairing of the Liberal Party and joined Keir Hardie's recently founded Independent Labour Party.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.135\\" In 1894 after the new act, everyone had to be re-elected to the Vestry and he stood under his new colours. This was too much for his chapel and he was forced to resign and withdraw before the poll.\\"The Parochial Elections\\", The Times, 7 December 1894. In 1897 he received a call to go to Cavendish Street where there was a huge chapel just off Oxford Road in Manchester.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.145\\" Here they wanted him because they were seeing declining numbers as their congregation moved to the suburbs. He had built a reputation as being able to attract members of the working classes to his services. In Manchester he was much involved with Passive Resistance, the movement protesting about the Education Act 1902 and the requirement for ratepayers to support Anglican and Catholic schools.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.179\\" By 1904 it had all become too much for him and he resigned and took up what he thought would be a less onerous pastorate at Harecourt Chapel, in Islington, London.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.193\\" Here he remained until early 1908. As an adjunct to his work within the temperance movement he was one of the founding directors of the Abstainers and General Insurance Company\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.84\\" and later became its Vice Chairman. After leaving the ministry he became a member of the London Chamber of Commerce. Over around 30 years he delivery some 500 -600 Sundary afternoon lectures. He also found time to write some 20 books including \\"Old, Yet Ever New\\", \\"Is My Bible True?\\", \\"OUR BIBLE - How We Got It\\", and \\"Sermons to Working Men\\". He also edited a paper called the Factory Herald for some years.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.288\\" Not content with that he became a guide for Thomas Cook and Son leading parties to the Holy Land. He was to visit the country some eleven times and the trips were always timed to bring the groups to Jerusalem in time for Easter.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.234\\" He had not been so fortunate in his private life, and he lost his two sons, Herbert and Harry, in infancy, and two of his four daughters, Ada and Dora, to TB, both at the age of 24.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", pp.29, 56, 145, 171\\" Only the first born, Elizabeth, and the last, Mabel, survived him. ==Member of Parliament== In May 1908 Leach was invited to contest the Colne Valley constituency as a Liberal Party candidate. A former member of the Independent Labour Party, he described himself as an \\"evolutionary socialist\\".\\"Election Intelligence\\", The Times, 1 June 1908. He was described by The Times as a weak candidate, but one who stood to inherit the strong Colne Valley Liberal vote,\\"Yorkshire County Pollings\\", The Times, 20 January 1910. and at the January 1910 general election, he defeated the Independent MP Victor Grayson. He made his maiden speech on 11 April 1910 supporting one of the resolutions that led up to the Parliament Act 1911. He was re-elected in December 1910, when he only faced a Conservative opponent.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.226\\" Leach supported women's suffrage, but registered his opposition to the actions of the suffragettes.\\"Woman Suffrage. Members' Protest Against Organized Rowdyism.\\", The Times, 14 December 1911. He also supported the Government in passing the National Insurance Act 1911. In February 1911 he introduced his private members Trade Union Bill \\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.228\\" to try to overcome the problems caused by the Osborne judgment, but it was to disappear into the parliamentary timetable. Despite this he was a very active backbencher asking numerous questions of ministers. Leach continued to preach occasionally while a Member of Parliament; he also travelled widely including to the near East, Canada and the USA.\\"New Writ for Colne Valley\\", The Times, 18 August 1916. ==Health problem== Appointed as a Chaplain to the Armed Forces, 4th class, during the First World War (at outbreak of which he was 67 years old), his duty was to visit the wounded in the London Military Hospitals.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.263\\" In 1915 the strain of this and his parliamentary duties became too much and he dropped out of public life. It was reported that he had suffered a nervous breakdown, and had to move to a nursing home in London. In reality it was much starker and he had been committed to Northumberland House, Green Lanes, a private lunatic asylum. He was declared to be suffering from an unsound mind, brain deterioration and loss of memory.\\"Worsted to Westminster\\", p.270\\" This would appear to have some physical cause and may well have been vascular dementia caused by small strokes or similar. Some eight months later he was found still to be of unsound mind and his seat was declared vacant under the Lunacy (Vacating of Seats) Act -- the only MP ever disqualified under that Act.Causes of Byelections since the Reform Act Probably this was due to Parliament having already been prolonged and it being impossible to hold a general election while the war persisted. Normally MPs are just allowed to retire quietly at the next election. At the resulting by-election on 25 August 1916, the Liberal Frederick Mallalieu was elected unopposed to succeed him. Leach died in 1919, aged 72. ==Notes== ==References== * *M. Stenton and S. Lees, \\"Who's Who of British MPs\\" Vol. II (Harvester Press, 1978) *J. B.

In the fall of 1994 they tried various drummers and guitarists. For one short period they even tried to play rap metal. Early 1995, though, they were joined by drummer Lutten Larsson and guitarist Mats Larsson both formerly with Stockholms Negrer. Mats Larson also played in the revival line up of the legendary Swedish punk band KSMB. The musical direction was also clearer now and could be described as high energy punk rock with noise and melodies. Late in 1995 Human Error signed a publishing deal with Sweden Music and also hooked up with Birdnest Records. By that time Lutten Larson had left the band being replaced by Anton Olemyr whose previous bands included early punkers Revolt and Irish styled outfit Bang The Drum. 1996 saw Human Error recording and releasing their debut album Pain, produced by Johan Johansson:sv:Johan Johansson (musiker) and also playing some live dates in Stockholm and K√∂ping. A couple of members of Human Error also appeared in the Swedish spaghetti western The Return of Jesus Part II,IMDB: The Return of Jesus Part II and the band contributed one song for the soundtrack. In 1997 Human Error, together with Bates Motel, embarked on the first ever club level tour in St. Petersburg by a western band. Early 1998 Human Error were back in Russia. This time to play in Moscow and also to headline the 7th Grand Freak Show in Bryansk. The gig in Bryansk was also the first in that city by a western act. Mats Larson left the band in 1998 and was replaced by Jocke Nilsson, who also plays guitar in The Pushers.www.thepushers.com In 1999 the band was back in Russia to do gigs in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Bryansk, once again to headline the Grand Freak Show.

Modelled on the Hungarian hussars, the early hussars were light cavalry of exiled Balkan warriors who were sent to Poland as mercenaries. Following the military reforms of king Stephen B√°thory in the second half of the 16th century, the hussar unit was adopted by the Polish military and transformed into a heavily armoured shock cavalry. The husaria banners and units participated in the largest cavalry charge in history at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and were the elite of Polish cavalry until their disbandment in the 1770s. ==History== Entrance of winged Polish hussar delegates in La Rochelle, France, in 1573, following the Siege of La Rochelle (1572‚Äì1573) and their offering of the Polish throne to the Duke of Anjou. Hussars originated in mercenary units of exiled Serbian warriors. Serbian lancers, also called Racowie, were used to counter Ottoman sipahi and deli cavalry. The oldest mention of hussars in Polish documents date to 1500, although they were probably in service earlier. In the 15th century, light hussars based on those of Hungarian King Mathias Corvinus were adopted by some European armies to provide light, expendable cavalry units. The Polish Hussars were originally based on the Hungarian Hussars. The development of light cavalry in the Polish army in the 16th century was partly modeled after the Serbian light cavalry that appeared in Corvinus' army. A historical reconstruction of a Winged Hussar, 2013 Initially the first hussar units in the Kingdom of Poland were formed by the Sejm (Polish parliament) in 1503, which hired three banners of Hungarian mercenaries. Soon, recruitment also began among Polish citizens. Being far more expendable than the heavily armoured lancers of the Renaissance, the Serbian-Hungarian hussars played a fairly minor role in the Polish Crown victories during the early 16th century, exemplified by the victories at Orsza (1514) and Obertyn (1531). During the so-called \\"transition period\\" of the mid-16th-century, heavy hussars largely replaced armoured lancers riding armoured horses, in the Polish Obrona Potoczna cavalry forces serving on the southern frontier. Polish hussars during entry into Krak√≥w, detail of so-called Stockholm Roll, 1605. The true \\"winged hussar\\" arrived with the reforms of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Bathory in the 1570s and was later led by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania John III Sobieski. The hussars were the leading, or even elite, branch of cavalry in the Polish army from the 1570s until 1776 when their duties and traditions were passed on to the Uhlans by a parliamentary decree. Most hussars were recruited from the wealthier Polish nobility (szlachta). Each hussar towarzysz (\\"comrade\\") raised his own poczet or lance/retinue. Several retinues were combined to form a hussar banner or company (chorƒÖgiew husarska). Over the course of the 16th century, hussars in Hungary became heavier in character: they abandoned wooden shields and adopted metal-plated body armour. When Bathory was elected King of Poland and later accepted as a Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1576, he reorganized the hussars of his Royal Guard into a heavy formation equipped with a long lance as their main weapon. By the reign of Bathory (1576‚Äì1586), the hussars had replaced medieval-style lancers in the Polish Crown army, and they now formed the bulk of the Polish cavalry. By the 1590s, most Polish hussar units had been reformed along the same \\"heavy\\" model. These heavy hussars were known in Poland as Husaria. With the Battle of Lubiszew in 1577, the 'Golden Age' of the Husaria began. Between then and the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Hussars fought many battles against various enemies, most of which they won. In the battles of Lubiszew in 1577, Byczyna (1588), Kokenhausen (1601), Kircholm (1605), K≈Çuszyn (1610), Chocim (1621), Martyn√≥w (1624), Trzciana (1629), Ochmat√≥w (1644), Beresteczko (1651), Po≈Çonka (1660), Cudn√≥w (1660), Chocim (1673), Lw√≥w (1675), Vienna (1683), and P√°rk√°ny (1683), they proved to be the decisive factor against often overwhelming odds. For instance, in the Battle of Kluszyn during the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War, the Russians outnumbered the Commonwealth army 5 to 1, yet were heavily defeated. The role of the Hussar evolved into a reconnaissance and advanced scout capacity. Their uniforms became more elaborate as their armour and heavy weapons were abandoned. In the 18th century, as infantry firearms became more effective, heavy cavalry, with its tactics of charging into and breaking infantry units, became increasingly obsolete and hussars transformed from an elite fighting unit to a parade one. > Instead of ostrich feathers, the husaria men wore wooden arcs attached to > their armour at the back and raising over their heads. These arcs, together > with bristling feathers sticking out of them, were dyed in various colours > in imitation of laurel branches or palm leaves, and were a strangely > beautiful sight to behold ... ‚Äì Jƒôdrzej Kitowicz (1728‚Äì1804).Anna > Wasilkowska, Husaria the winged Horsemen, Interpress, Warszawa 1998, , > p.7-6.Jƒôdrzej Kitowicz, Opis obyczaj√≥w i dziej√≥w za panowania Augusta III, > Boles≈Çaw M. Wolff, Petersburg i Mohylew, 1855. The Hussars were famous for their huge \\"wings\\", a wooden frame carrying eagle, ostrich, swan or goose feathers. In the 16th century, characteristic painted wings or winged claws began to appear on cavalry shields. The most common theory is that the hussars wore the wings because they made a loud, clattering noise which made it seem like the cavalry was much larger than in reality and frightened the enemy's horses; however, such sounds would be impossible to hear in battle. The wings (or wing) was mostly used to block the back of the rider from swords or protect them from getting thrown off their horse by Tatar riders. ==Tactics== Hussar formation at the Battle of Klushino (1610), painting by Szymon Boguszowicz, 1620 The hussars represented the heavy cavalry of the Commonwealth. The Towarzysz husarski (Companion) commanded his own poczet (kopia) consisting of two to five similarly armed retainers and other servants (czeladnicy) who tended to his horses, food, supplies, repairs and fodder and often participated in battle. His 'lance' was part of a larger unit known as a banner (chorƒÖgiew). Each banner had from 30 to over 60 kopia. The commander, per his contractual obligation, was called \\"rotmistrz\\", while the de facto commander was often the porucznik (lieutenant). There was also one chorƒÖ≈ºy (ensign) who carried the banner's flag (\\"znak\\" or \\"chorƒÖgiew\\") and could command the banner when the porucznik was unable to. Each banner had one rotmistrz kopia that was larger than its other lances; this included trumpeters, and musicians (kettle drummers, more trumpeters etc.). There were other towarzysze with duties (keeping order, helping with manoeuvres) within the banner during battle, but their functions are rather poorly understood. The Polish hussars' primary battle tactic was the charge. They charged at and through the enemy. The charge started at a slow pace and in a relatively loose formation. The formation gradually gathered pace and closed ranks while approaching the enemy, and reached its highest pace and closest formation immediately before engagement. They tended to repeat the charge several times until the enemy formation broke (they had supply wagons with spare lances). The tactic of a charge by heavily armoured hussars and horses was usually decisive for nearly two centuries. The hussars fought with a long lance, a koncerz (stabbing sword), a szabla (sabre), set of two to six pistols, often a carbine or arquebus (known in Polish as a bandolet) and sometimes a warhammer or light axe. The lighter, Ottoman-style saddle allowed for more armour to be used by both the horses and the warriors. Moreover, the horses were bred to run very fast with a heavy load and to recover quickly. These were hybrids of old, Polish equine lineage and eastern horses, usually from Tatar tribes. As a result, a horse could walk hundreds of kilometres loaded with over 100 kilograms (warrior plus armour and weaponry) and instantly charge. Also, hussar horses were very quick and maneuverable. This made hussars able to fight with any cavalry or infantry force from western heavy cuirassiers to quick Tatars. There was a death penalty for selling a husaria horse (sometimes the horses were referred to as \\"tarpan\\") to someone outside of Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. ==Armour and weaponry== Polish Hussar half-armour Winged Riders.jpgHussar half-armour from the mid-17th century, National Museum in Krak√≥w. Zbroje husarskie.JPGHussar armour, dating to the first half of the 17th century, Polish Army Museum in Warsaw. Karacena.JPGScale armour of King John III Sobieski. Szabla husarska GIM.jpgPolish hussar sabre (Polish \\"szabla\\") The hussars' towarzysz were required to provide the arms and armour for themselves and their retainers, except for the lance which was provided by the King. Each lance's horses also came at each towarzysz husarski's expense. During their heyday, 1574‚Äì1705, winged hussars carried the following arms and armour: The 'kopia' lance was the main offensive weapon of the hussar. The lances were based on the Balkan and, finally, Hungarian lances, but Polish lances could have been longer and, like their predecessors from the Balkans and Western Europe, they were hollowed, with two halves glued together and painted, and were often richly gilded. They were commonly made from fir-wood, with the lance point being made from forged steel. They had a ga≈Çka, a large wooden ball which served as the handle guard. The hussar's lances usually ranged from in length and were provided by the King or the banner's owner, not by the regular soldiers. A large 'silk'/taffeta proporzec pennon was attached to the lance below the point. Another type of lance, known as the demi-lance or kopijka, and was long and was used against the Tatars and Turks in late-17th-century wars. Grand Standard Bearer of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (ChorƒÖ≈ºy Wielki Koronny) on the Stockholm Roll (c. 1605) The Towarzysz husarski carried underneath his left thigh an Eastern-derived koncerz estoc (up to in length) and, often, a palasz (a type of broadsword) under his right thigh. The szabla sabre was carried on the left side, and several types of sabres were known to winged hussars, including the famous szabla husarska. Winged hussars sometimes carried additional weapons, such as \\"nadziak\\" type of war hammers and battleaxes. Towarzysz husarski carried one or two wheellock (later flintlock) pistols in the saddle holsters, while retainers also might have carried a pistol or light wheellock arquebus or carbine; from the 1680s a carbine for retainers was mandatory. Individual hussar towarzysz may possibly have carried a Tatar or Turkish reflex bow with arrows in a quiver, especially after the mid-17th century, when many 'pancerny' companions became hussars, and some sources of the late 17th century note the existence of bows amongst the hussar companions. During the first half of the 18th century, while in non-military attire, the hussars' companion carried a bow in a bow case to denote his military status. Yet bows in bow cases were carried by all cavalry officers of the National Army until the reforms of the 1770s, including Uhlan units in the Saxon service. At the height of their prowess, from 1576 to 1653, hussar armour consisted of a Polish variant of the szyszak Oriental Turkic- originated helmet with a hemispherical skull, comb-like, Western morion 'cheekpieces' with a heart-shaped cut in the middle, neck-guard of several plates secured by sliding rivets, and adjustable nasal terminating in a leaf- shaped visor. Szyszak and kettle hat helmets for the lower rank (retainers) were often blackened as was their armour. A cuirass (breast plate), back plate, gorget, shoulder guards and of the Great Steppe, Western vambraces with iron glove and later, during the 1630s, the Persian-originated karwasz vambrace, for forearm protection. Towarzysz also could wear tasset hip, cuisse thigh and poleyn knee protection, underneath a thigh-length coat of mail or specially padded coat with mail sleeves. Retainers usually wore less expensive and older armour, often painted black, and, after the 1670s, might have no cuirass, according to some sources. Karacena Sarmatian armour (of iron scales riveted to a leather support) might have consisted of a scale helmet, cuirass, gorget, leg and shoulder protection and became popular during the reign of King John Sobieski, but perhaps due to costs and weight, remained popular mostly with the winged hussar commanding officers. Their armour was light, usually around , allowing them to be relatively quick and for their horses to gallop at full speed for long periods. Albeit from the 1670s onwards, chain- mail was used when fighting the Tatars in the southern part of the republic. Towarzysz usually wore a leopard (sometimes tiger, jaguar or lion) pelt over his left shoulder, or as often depicted in the surviving Podhorce Castle paintings, he had the exotic pelt underneath his saddle or wrapped around his hips. Wolf, brown bear and lynx pelts were reserved for leaders and veterans (starszyzna). Koncerz husarski ‚Äì Koncerz a stabbing type of sword of the Polish hussars, often used against heavily armored opponents ==Legacy== The Polish hussars are depicted on the commemorative 200 z≈Çotych gold coin. The badge of the Polish Army's 1st Armoured Division is inspired by the armour of the Winged Hussars. In 2016, the Swedish Metal band Sabaton wrote the song \\"Winged Hussars\\" for their album The Last Stand. The song is about the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and the Hussars' charge which helped defeat the Ottomans. ==See also== * Polish cavalry * Towarzysz * Towarzysz pancerny * Poczet * Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ==References== ==Bibliography== * Zbigniew Boche≈Ñski - Ze studi√≥w nad polskƒÖ zbrojƒÖ husarskƒÖ.

English defamation law concerning qualified privilege for publication of defamatory statements in the public interest. The case provided the Reynolds defence, which could be raised where it was clear that the journalist had a duty to publish an allegation even if it turned out to be wrong. In adjudicating on an attempted Reynolds defence a court would investigate the conduct of the journalist and the content of the publication. The subsequent case of Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe[2006] UKHL 44 affirmed the defence, which was subsequently raised successfully in several defamation proceedings.Roberts v Gable [2007] EWCA Civ 721Armstrong v Times Newspapers Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1007Al-Fagih v HH Saudi Research & Marketing (UK) Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 1634 The defence was abolished by s4(6) Defamation Act 2013, being replaced with the statutory defence of publication on a matter of public interest. ==Facts== Albert Reynolds had been the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland until a political crisis in 1994. The Times had published an article in Ireland to the effect that Reynolds had misled the Irish Parliament; this article was then published in the United Kingdom. However, the UK version omitted an explanation that Reynolds had given for the events, which had been printed in the original article. Reynolds brought an action for defamation. The defences of justification and fair comment were unavailable, given the factual nature of the article. Times Newspapers Ltd appealed that the defence of qualified privilege be considered; the Court of Appeal denied this. The appeal to the House of Lords was therefore on the matter of whether the defence of qualified privilege be extended to cover the mass media. ==Lords judgement: the ten criteria== Lord Nicholls, speaking for the majority, upheld Lord Bingham's judgement in the Court of Appeal, adding to it a list of ten criteria against which attempts to use the defence of qualified privilege should be judged: > The elasticity of the common law principle enables interference with freedom > of speech to be confined to what is necessary in the circumstances of the > case. This elasticity enables the court to give appropriate weight, in > today's conditions, to the importance of freedom of expression by the media > on all matters of public concern. Depending on the circumstances, the > matters to be taken into account include the following. The comments are > illustrative only. # The seriousness of the allegation. The more serious the > charge, the more the public is misinformed and the individual harmed, if the > allegation is not true. # The nature of the information, and the extent to > which the subject-matter is a matter of public concern. # The source of the > information. Some informants have no direct knowledge of the events. Some > have their own axes to grind, or are being paid for their stories. # The > steps taken to verify the information. # The status of the information. The > allegation may have already been the subject of an investigation which > commands respect. # The urgency of the matter. News is often a perishable > commodity. # Whether comment was sought from the plaintiff. He may have > information others do not possess or have not disclosed. An approach to the > plaintiff will not always be necessary. # Whether the article contained the > gist of the plaintiff's side of the story. # The tone of the article. A > newspaper can raise queries or call for an investigation. It need not adopt > allegations as statements of fact. # The circumstances of the publication, > including the timing. This list is not exhaustive. The weight to be given to > these and any other relevant factors will vary from case to case. Any > disputes of primary fact will be a matter for the jury, if there is one. The > decision on whether, having regard to the admitted or proved facts, the > publication was subject to qualified privilege is a matter for the judge. > This is the established practice and seems sound. A balancing operation is > better carried out by a judge in a reasoned judgment than by a jury. Over > time, a valuable corpus of case law will be built up. Qualified privilege, as defined and limited by this ruling, became known as the Reynolds defence after this case. ==Subsequent developments== The ruling was affirmed in 2006 by the House of Lords in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe, where Lord Hoffmann, giving the lead judgment, stated that Lord Nicholls' criteria were not to be seen as obstacles or hurdles that any journalist had to overcome in order to avail him or herself of the privilege. ==Defamation Act 2013== Section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013 created the defence of \\"publication on a matter of public interest\\". This replaced the common law Reynolds defence, abolished by subsection 4(6).http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/26/contents/enacted ==See also== * Walter v Lane, court case involving The Times * New York Times v.

He was elected as a representative from La Union to the Philippine Assembly in 1910, and served in that capacity until 1912. That year, he was named a provincial fiscal for Ilocos Sur. In 1917, he was appointed city fiscal of Manila. He was later appointed as a trial court judge.Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 156 In 1927, while serving as a judge, D√≠az was appointed to head a commission tasked with revising the penal code of the Philippines. By 1930, his committee had finished drafting the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, which remains as the basic penal law in the Philippines. D√≠az was appointed to the Supreme Court by the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt on July 20, 1933. Among his more notable opinions was in People v. Cu Unjieng, 61 Phil. 236 (1935), which was one of the more widely talked-about criminal cases of its day. D√≠az's service in the Court was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. The ensuing Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941 effectively prevented the Supreme Court organized under the Commonwealth government. When the Japanese reestablished the Court in 1942, none of the incumbent members of the old Court were appointed to the new tribunal headed by Jos√© Yulo. ==Death== D√≠az was one of two Supreme Court Justices who were executed by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Battle of Manila in 1945. On February 10, the then-paralyzed D√≠az and two of his sons were among 300 men herded by the Japanese army and lined up along the corner of Taft Avenue and Padre Faura in Ermita, Manila. Japanese soldiers then opened machine gun fire, killing D√≠az and his sons as well as scores of others.By Sword and Fire, p. 253-255 Two days later, Diaz's colleague on the Court, Antonio Villa-Real, was murdered by Japanese forces in nearby Pasay. The area where D√≠az was executed would later become part of the Supreme Court compound when the Court relocated to Padre Faura after the war. ==References== * * ==Notes== Category:1878 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Executed Filipino people Category:Filipino lawyers Category:Filipino judges Category:People executed by Japanese occupation forces Category:People from La Union Category:Spanish- language writers of the Philippines Category:Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from La Union Category:People executed by Japan by firing squad Category:Members of the Philippine Legislature ","title":"Anacleto D√≠az"},{"id":"9146051","text":"Sinoutskerke en Baarsdorp is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

It overlooks the valley, protected by steep ravines to the north and west, and moated by the brook. == Successor to Kington Castle == It is likely that this castle was built as the successor of nearby Kington Castle which was probably destroyed in 1216. == Powerful Barons, Kings & Future Royalty == The castle had been in the hands of the de Braose family but was seized in 1228 by Henry III following the death of Reginald de Braose. However the castle must have been returned to the de Braose family because on the death of William de Braose it passed by marriage to the de Bohun family and saw some fighting during the Baron's War of the 1260s. It remained in this family until the death of its last male heir in 1372. The eldest daughter of the family Mary de Bohun married Henry, Earl of Derby who was elevated to the rank of Duke of Hereford by Richard II, his cousin. It remained his property until his own accession to the throne as Henry IV in 1399. == Granted to Stafford by King Henry IV == The castle then passed to Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. In 1403 he was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury and possession passed to his widow, Anne, Countess of Stafford who then refortified the castle against Owain Glynd≈µr. == Owain Glyndwr's Rebellion == She appointed John Sment as Constable of the castle, better placed than her to expertly man its defences. Glyndwr's forces came upon the castle flush after their total victory at the Battle of Bryn Glas, they simply drove the cattle away, took flour from the local mill and then burned the mill to the ground. == After 1415 == It appears that the castle then went into decline. Peace was restored to the Welsh Marches during the reign of King Henry V with its focus on conflict abroad with France. == Reversion to the Crown == By 1564 it was in the possession of the Crown but then passed through a succession of hands. == The Civil War == By the time of the English Civil War in 1642 it was a total ruin as a fortress. By 1670 the stone keep was still extant. == Currently == Now only the earthworks and some portions of stonework remain.

He studied medicine in Valencia and Madrid, and in 1877 was appointed director of the Santa Isabel insane asylum at Legan√©s, outside of Madrid. From 1880 he lived in Paris and studied general anatomy and histology with Louis-Antoine Ranvier and clinical neurology under Jean Martin Charcot. Here he also came under the influence of philosopher Ernest Renan (1823‚Äì1892). anatomist Mathias-Marie Duval (1844‚Äì1907) and psychiatrist Valentin Magnan (1835‚Äì1916). In 1885 he returned to Madrid and opened a private practice, and in 1902 was appointed to the first chair of experimental psychology in Spain. Portrait of Dr Simarro at the microscope, 1897, (Luis Simarro Legacy Trust, Fundaci√≥n General, Complutense University) As a psychiatrist, Simarro was heavily influenced by developments in Germany, particularly Emil Kraepelin's classification and treatment of the insane, Wilhelm Wundt's theory of experimental psychology and Theodor Ziehen's critical analysis of Wundt's approach to psychology. Notwithstanding his work in psychiatry, Simarro is largely remembered for a contribution made in histology when he developed a silver bromide modification of Camillo Golgi's silver chromate technique. Famed Spanish histologist Ramon y Cajal recognized Simarro's achievement, and mentioned that it was a milestone that allowed him to abandon general histology and to focus on neurohistology. == Bibliography == * Campos, J.J.

He first played drums at the age of 14 and was a professional musician by the time he left school. Underwood has collaborated with a number of notable musicians and groups, including Jet Harris, The Outlaws (with Ritchie Blackmore), The Herd (with Peter Frampton), Episode Six (with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover), Quatermass (with John Gustafson) and Gillan (again with Gillan). He is currently the drummer for Mick Underwood's Glory Road. ==Early years== Underwood was born in Middlesex. At the age of 14 he was given his first drum, a second-hand snare drum, and added a third-hand bass drum shortly after. He received drum tuition from Jim Marshall, who went on to become the inventor and manufacturer of the Marshall amplifier. During this period, Underwood met Ritchie Blackmore (then known as Ricky Blackmore) and the two played together in a band called The Dominators, although Underwood was eventually asked to leave the band for \\"...playing too loud!\\" His next band was The Satellites, until he was invited to join The Crescents, who were playing residencies at large ballrooms. Underwood left school at 16 to work with Jet Harris, and joined a tour of Britain with Sam Cooke and Little Richard. It was at the end of this tour that Screaming Lord Sutch (in whose band, The Savages, Blackmore now played) suggested he approach the independent record producer Joe Meek for further session work. ==Career1963‚Äì1965=== Meek's studio, RGM Sound, was based in North London, where he used a band called The Outlaws as his permanent studio musicians, also allowing them to record material under their own name. When Underwood arrived to audition for Meek, the Outlaws were also recruiting for a lead guitarist and it was Underwood who suggested Ritchie Blackmore should fill the role, an invitation he duly accepted. Between January 1963 and June 1965, The Outlaws released six singles, as well as playing on hundreds of Meek's recording sessions with various artists. They also headlined at the Star-Club in Hamburg with both Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent. In 1964, they appeared in the movie Live It Up!, performing their single \\"Law & Order\\", mislabelled \\"Law and Disorder\\" on the end screen credits. A reviewer of Underwood's work at this time described his drumming style as \\"...coupling Charlie Watts type steadiness with little Jim McCarty style flourishes.\\" Blackmore eventually moved to another of Meeks' bands, joining Heinz Burt's backing band The Wild Boys, but he and Underwood still collaborated in recording sessions with Meek's engineer Derek Lawrence. One of the Derek Lawrence sessions produced Blackmore's first official release, the now highly sought after single \\"Get Away\\" / \\"Little Brown Jug\\", released in July 1965. They also recorded \\"Earthshaker\\" and \\"Satan's Holiday, \\" which were released on the Titan label, credited to The Lancasters. \\"Satan's Holiday\\" was a fast, rock adaptation of Grieg's \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\", a tune that stayed in Blackmore's stage repertory right into the 1990s. Shortly afterwards, Underwood also left The Outlaws to take up an offer to join The Herd. ===1965‚Äì1968=== With The Herd, Underwood began playing at all the major venues on the circuit, such as the Marquee Club and Eel Pie Island. Despite their busy schedule and the release of three singles, Underwood grew increasingly frustrated at the band's lack of success, and in 1966 he resigned from the band and the music business. However, a year later he accepted an invitation from singer James Royal as a session drummer for a two-week residency at Hatchets in London's West End. At the end of the residency Underwood decided to stay with the band, the James Royal Set to tour with Johnny Cash. At the end of this tour Underwood spoke with Peter Grant, whom he knew from the time that Grant had been tour manager for Gene Vincent when The Outlaws had been his backing band. Grant explained that he was currently working with guitarist Jimmy Page, and was recruiting musicians to form a new band around him. Underwood considered the offer, but instead accepted one to join established act Episode Six. Grant had asked one of his other acts, singer Terry Reid, to join the project, who had also turned down the offer. Undeterred, Grant went on to recruit two previously unknown musicians, the singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham, and the band became Led Zeppelin. Underwood joined ex-The Authentics frontman Henry Turtle in psychedelic rock outfit The Doves from 1967 to 1968 alongside former The Herd guitarist Terry Clark plus Brian Curtis, Ian McGlynn and Harvey Hinsley (formerly of The Outlaws and later a member of Hot Chocolate. Underwood departed in July 1968 after EMI declined to release intended single She's Not There, with Decca having done the same with the band's planned debut single, Smokeytime, Springtime, the previous Autumn. ===1968‚Äì1970=== Roger Glover, bass player for Episode Six, said of their new drummer: \\"Mick represented a step up for us because he had been around in other bands. The Herd had one fairly big hit so it was as if we had been connected with success.\\" Also in the band was singer Ian Gillan. Despite numerous BBC sessions and two singles, commercial success never came for the band and there was a feeling that they were failing to move with the times as the music scene rapidly changed at the close of the 1960s. Along with Gillan, Underwood was drawn to the heavier sound of the emergent new bands, in particular Deep Purple (Ritchie Blackmore's new band) and Led Zeppelin. When Blackmore contacted Underwood for a recommendation for a singer, he immediately gave them Gillan's name. Along with Jon Lord, Blackmore attended an Episode Six gig to listen to Gillan, and shortly afterwards recruited both him and Roger Glover into Deep Purple. Following this shake-up, bassist/singer John Gustafson and keyboard player Pete Robinson were called in to shore up the band, but shortly afterwards the two newcomers left, along with Underwood, to form their own band Quatermass. ===1970‚Äì1979=== After several showcase gigs, Quatermass were signed by George Martin's Air London company and began to put together their first album, using their own material plus several songs written by Steve Hammond. Recorded at EMI's Abbey Road Studios the band's eponymous album was released on EMI's progressive rock label Harvest Records. One of the Hammond tracks on the album was titled \\"Black Sheep of the Family\\", later covered by Blackmore on the first Rainbow album. To promote the album the band undertook a European tour, with performances on radio and TV timed to coincide with the release of the album in various countries. Despite wide critical acclaim, the project had insufficient financial backing however, and there were many problems on their subsequent tour of the United States. On their return to the UK the band dissolved. Underwood began discussions with Paul Rodgers who was looking to form a new band after the break up of Free, and along with bass player Stuart McDonald they formed the band Peace. Signed to Island Records, Peace began to write material for a debut album and also embarked on a UK tour supporting Mott the Hoople but within a year Free reformed, and Underwood formed another new band, called Sammy. It was around this time that Underwood was offered the position of drummer with Hot Chocolate but he declined and successfully recommended Tony Connor ‚Äì who had recently left Audience ‚Äì for a position which was then held, temporarily, by session drummer Cozy Powell. Underwood called on Gillan to produce their first single, and the band then went into rehearsals for their debut album, which was then recorded in a single 72-hour session. As in previous projects, there was little commercial success and Underwood dissolved the band, returning to session drumming. His next band was Strapps. Their eponymous debut album was recorded in 1976 at Ian Gillan's Kingsway Recorders studio in London, produced by former Episode Six colleague Roger Glover. They then toured as support act on Deep Purple's tour of the UK, and went on to release three further albums. Underwood worked again with Gillan as the support act on the UK tour of the Ian Gillan Band, whose line-up included former Quatermass colleague John Gustafson, on bass and backing vocals. Underwood sometimes took the opportunity to view the show from within the audience after playing his own set, and recalled that he \\"really picked up this bewildered vibe. The fans just couldn't connect with the music, however well it was played.\\" Strapps fourth and final album Ball of Fire was recorded at Ian Gillan's Kingsway studios and during recording Underwood was asked by Gillan if he could use a couple of hours of their studio time to lay down a vocal with his latest band, Gillan. Several weeks later Gillan invited him to be the drummer in this new venture. ===1979‚Äì1982=== Former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice had also auditioned for Gillan but according to guitarist Bernie Torme \\"...he had some difficulty after playing \\"Secret of the Dance\\" due to his only having one lung, and being a bit out of practice. He played it brilliantly but he had to lie down on the floor for five minutes afterwards. He did not want to join because of our fast tracks, he said he no longer wanted to play stuff like that. I think the fact that he had been offered to join Whitesnake with his old friend Jon Lord made a big difference. Meeting Gillan again at the studio had obviously put Underwood's name on the list of potentials for the job, and as Torme revealed \\"...we finally found the magnificently solid and under appreciated Mick Underwood. The day after he accepted the job, Underwood and the band began to record the Mr. Universe album, released in October 1979. ===Since 2006=== Since 2006, Underwood along with bassist Johnny Heywood and former Heavy Metal Kids guitarist Cosmo, formed the blues-based trio Raw Glory, which released an album, City Life, in 2007. In 2012, he formed Mick Underwood's Glory Road with Rob Cooksley as singer, Jeff Summers on guitar, Gary Summers on bass and backing vocals and Roy Shipston on keyboard, which consists of songs from the Gillan era. ==Discography== Underwood performed as a session musician on hundreds of recordings, and much of his catalogue of later works have been reissued on retrospective compilations of other artist's works.

He then continued his education in Bucharest, Bolhrad and Odessa with the financial support of his wealthy relative Marincho Benli. Six month prior to his graduation from the South Slavic boarding school in Mykolaiv, which he attended between 1869 and 1873, Volov was forced to return to Shumen due to an illness. He was appointed head teacher and director of the local class school. He also organized a night school and took an active part in the activities of the local cultural centre (chitalishte). Volov also conducted revolutionary work in Shumen and the region. In August 1874 Volov participated in the general assembly of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee in Bucharest and was chosen as the chairman of the Shumen local revolutionary committee. Volov was arrested and sent to prison for his participation in the conflict between the local youth and the European engineers working on the Kaspichan‚ÄìShumen‚ÄìYambol railway. Volov headed the dissatisfied locals who cancelled the wedding of a French engineer with a local girl. Following several months in prison, Volov was released and went to Romania. Panayot Volov took part in the organization of the unsuccessful Stara Zagora Uprising of 1875. He was among the co-founders and most active workers of the Gyurgevo Revolutionary Committee. He was appointed the main \\"apostle\\" of the 4th revolutionary district in Plovdiv, but after contradictions between him and his assistant Georgi Benkovski Volov gave up the leadership. Volov was one of the initiators of the Oborishte Assembly of the 4th district near Panagyurishte. When the April Uprising broke out, Volov was in Panagyurishte, where he incited the locals to support the rebellion together with other \\"apostles\\". Following the uprising's utter defeat, he was betrayed to the Ottoman authorities during their attempt to flee to Romania and drowned in the Yantra River near Byala on 26 May 1876. == Honours == Volov Peak on Davis Coast in Antarctica is named after him,SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica Australian Government Department of the Environment/Australian Antarctic Division as well as the football club FC Volov Shumen and its home stadium, Stadion Panayot Volov. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1850 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from Shumen Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries Category:19th-century Bulgarian people ","title":"Panayot Volov"},{"id":"9146230","text":"Dnipro River and right-bank are seen in the background. light rail's Myloslavska Street Station.

The 46-track, two-CD album features all of the songs from the four studio albums recorded on the label during these years: Lone Star State of Mind (1987), Little Love Affairs (1988), Storms (1989) and Late Night Grande Hotel (1991), as well as three previously unreleased recordings. ==Background== The Complete MCA Studio Recordings collects Griffith's four studio albums recorded with MCA between 1987 and 1991. The compilation chronicles a period in the label's history when it signed \\"left-of-center\\" country artists including Griffith, Steve Earle, and Lyle Lovett. When Griffith's first two albums, Lone Star State of Mind and Little Love Affairs, failed to produce a major country hit, she was moved to MCA's pop division where she released Storms and Late Night Grande Hotel, the latter of which alienated her original fan base and resulted in her being dropped by the label. After a stint on Elektra Records, Griffith signed in 2002 with Rounder Records, which ironically had a distribution deal with MCA. This gave the label a significant stake in Griffith's early recordings and prompted the release of The Complete MCA Studio Recordings among other compilations. This set includes three bonus tracks that were previously unavailable in the United States‚Äî\\"Tumble and Fall\\", \\"Wooden Heart\\", and \\"Stand Your Ground\\". ==Reviews== In a review of The Complete MCA Studio Recordings for PopMatters, Andrew Gilstrap called it \\"a definitive collection\\" for Griffith fans and noted that it \\"makes more apparent the stylistic growth she experienced during those years.\\" Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann remarked that upon listening to the entire set, \\"The first two albums are no more country than Griffith's early 'folk' albums, and the last two are not so 'pop.'\\" Ruhlmann added that the songs that make up the compilation \\"stand up well a decade later and are likely to sound just as good many decades hence.\\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Nanci Griffith; except where indicated ===Disc 1=== #\\"Tumble And Fall\\" 2:41 #\\"Lone Star State Of Mind\\" (Fred Koller, Pat Alger, Gene Levine) 3:58 #\\"Cold Hearts/Closed Minds\\" 2:42 #\\"From A Distance\\" (Julie Gold) 4:12 #\\"Beacon Street\\" 2:52 #\\"Nickel Dreams\\" (Mac McAnally, Don Lowery) 2:50 #\\"Sing One For Sister\\" (Robert Earl Keen Jnr) 3:22 #\\"Ford Econoline\\" 2:13 #\\"Trouble In The Fields\\" (Griffith, Rick West) 3:20 #\\"Love In A Memory\\" 3:19 #\\"Let It Shine On Me\\" (Paul Kennerley) 3:01 #\\"There's A Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret)\\" 4:23 #\\"Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool\\" 2:40 #\\"I Knew Love\\" (Roger Brown) 3:17 #\\"Never Mind\\" (Harlan Howard) 3:42 #\\"Love Wore A Halo (Back Before The War)\\" 3:23 #\\"So Long Ago\\" 4:09 #\\"Gulf Coast Highway\\" (Griffith, James Hooker, Danny Flowers) 3:06 #\\"Little Love Affairs\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 3:09 #\\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" 2:39 #\\"Outbound Plane\\" (Griffith, Tom Russell) 2:40 #\\"I Would Change My Life\\" (Robert Earl Keen Jnr) 3:08 #\\"Sweet Dreams Will Come\\" (John Stewart) 4:26 #\\"Wooden Heart\\" (Bert Kaempfert, Kay Twomey, Fred Wise, Ben Weisman) 2:28 ===Disc 2=== #\\"I Don't Want To Talk About Love\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 4:07 #\\"Drive-In Movies And Dashboard Lights\\" 3:13 #\\"You Made This Love A Teardrop\\" 3:11 #\\"Brave Companion Of The Road\\" 3:19 #\\"Storms\\" (Eric Taylor) 3:11 #\\"It's A Hard Life Wherever You Go\\" 4:01 #\\"If Wishes Were Changes\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 3:44 #\\"Listen To The Radio\\" 3:48 #\\"Leaving The Harbor\\" 3:28 #\\"Radio Fragile\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 5:34 #\\"It's Just Another Morning Here\\" 4:23 #\\"Late Night Grande Hotel\\" 3:35 #\\"It's Too Late\\" 2:18 #\\"Fields Of Summer\\" (4:19 #\\"Heaven\\" (Julie Gold) 3:29 #\\"The Power Lines\\" (Griffith, Pat Alger, James Hooker) 2:38 #\\"Hometown Streets\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 4:11 #\\"Down 'N' Outer\\" 2:46 #\\"One Blade Shy Of A Sharp Edge\\" 2:59 #\\"The Sun, Moon, And Stars\\" (Vince Bell) 4:24 #\\"San Diego Serenade\\" (Tom Waits) 3:27 #\\"Stand Your Ground\\" (Griffith, James Hooker) 3:51 ==References== == External links == * The Complete MCA Studio Recordings, Nanci Griffith.com Discography Category:Nanci Griffith compilation albums Category:2003 compilation albums Category:MCA Records compilation albums ","title":"The Complete MCA Studio Recordings"},{"id":"9146308","text":"Kispiox, BC Kispiox is a Gitxsan (often known also as Gitksan, due to eastern and western dialects) village of approximately 550 in the Kispiox Valley, at the confluence of the Kispiox and Skeena Rivers in British Columbia.

Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb is an example of circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibres by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibres in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibres are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy. In general, there are two main systems of preparing fibre for yarn: the worsted system and the woollen system. The worsted system is defined by the removal of short fibres by combing and top preparation by gilling. In the woollen system, short fibres are retained, and it may or may not involve combing. ==Description== The circular combs used have long metal teeth, and only barely resemble the comb used on hair. However, they are used in a similar fashion with one comb holding the fibre, which is slowly dubbed in by a brush, while the other is moved through, slowly transferring the fibre to the moving comb. The rectilinear comb uses a circular comb mounted on a drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fibre (set by a scale so fibres less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example, 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe to act as an impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminants are removed. The circular combing without short fibres is placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion are repeated and combed fibres - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fibre end irregularity (Sokolov 1994). Combing the fibres removes the short fibres and arranges the fibre in a flat bundle, with all the fibres going the same direction. This preparation is commonly used to spin a worsted yarn. Woollen yarns cannot be spun from fibre prepared with combs, instead, the fibre must be carded. Cotton is combed when it is to be used for quality fabric with high thread counts. In general, combing is done to filter or sieve out any short length fibres (for example, fibres shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, followed by the gilling process, which removes hooks and involves three separate machines. Combing is then followed by two Gillings to remove irregularity in the sliver and randomize fibre ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a sliver can be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibres with a suitable average length of 150 mm. Combing is a mechanical sieve, and so will not remove any contaminant with a form similar to the fibre being combed. Such contaminants must be mended out from a final garment. The manual mending out is a costly process. There are two competing combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the French comb. The Noble comb technology is inefficient, hence most combing in the world is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fibre. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fibre's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a rectilinear combing system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18‚Äì19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology ‚Äì resulting in the development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.Happey, F., Contemporary Textile Engineering, 1982 Efforts were made by Bradford to study the mechanism of noble combing but they failed to produce tangible results., Dyson E and Happey 1960 The Noble and French combs are now well-understood technology thanks to work by CSIRO.Sokolov and Kirby, CSIRO 1990-94 After 1994, Sokolov has endeavoured to improve combing performance in the rectilinear comb. Combing technology continues to develop: Sokolov and Kirby developed a theory for combing model, simulation software for combing and drive design in 1982. Current technology used in providing comb drive by introducing innovation on cam performance to deliver textile fibre needs and separate mechanical performance of the comb was developed by Sokolov. The cam technology was an advance on century-old technology of cams by producing a subspecies of new cam design. ==Machinery== In cotton manufacture, the Heilmann comber was superseded by the Naismith comber. In the worsted process a Noble comber was a common make, but now a French comber is more common. The Noble comb is no longer used in worsted system as technology is inefficient. Noble combing may have used for woollen system or long fibres 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibres is the French comb system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a rectilinear comb relative to a mean fibre length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of the wool comb can be seen in a stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fibre length and fibre physics requirements. The same scaled-up version of a comb can be seen in the way flax is combed.Sokolov, Nick 2013 ==See also== * Carding ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Spinning ","title":"Combing"},{"id":"9146369","text":"right Valkenisse is a former municipality in the Dutch province of Zeeland, on the peninsula of Walcheren.

It is most notable for a resort developed around an old silk factory, included in the UNESCO World Heritage sites list in 1997. It is located 3.5 km northwest of Caserta, at 145 m above sea level. ==History== In 1750 Charles VII of Naples, advised by minister Bernardo Tanucci, selected this place, originally the site of a royal hunting lodge for the Acquaviva family (now restored, and known as Palazzo del Belvedere), for an unusual social and technological experiment, a different model of production based on technical innovation and alert to the needs of workers. In its early days, San Leucio resort was a place for pleasure and a royal hunting preserve, built on the ruins of Saint Leucio church, where an aqueduct carried water to the waterfalls of the Royal Caserta Palace, designed by Vanvitelli. The son of Charles, Ferdinand I, had a hunting lodge built for himself on this site. He was a very skillful hunter who disliked the pleasures and luxury of court life. It was here that Charles and the young king Ferdinand built a silk factory. The complex was transformed into a silk production site and industrial buildings were added, which was quite unique in late 18th-century Europe. Architect Francesco Collecini designed these industrial buildings, where noisy looms were installed next to royal apartments and a sitting room became a chapel for the workers. A new village was built for workers' residences, and a large community of silk weavers grew into this industrial town, which in 1789 was deemed the \\"Real Colonia dei Setaioli\\" (the Silk Weavers Royal Colony). The king had planned to expand it into a true new city, called Ferdinandopoli, but the project was halted by the French invasion. In San Leucio the most advanced technologies known in Europe at the time were used throughout the process to obtain the finished products. The members of the colony had a privileged status with a modern social security system. The revolution of 1799 stopped the complete realization of the Ferdinandopoli, but San Leucio resort had further growth during the French rule from 1806 to 1815. ==Today== The heritage of King Ferdinand still survives today in the local silk and textile firms, which works on an international scale to elite foreign clients as the Buckingham Palace, the White House, the Quirinale Palace and the Palazzo Chigi. San Leucio resort is home to a Living Silk Museum with some original old looms and machinery restored and displayed inside the Belvedere courtyard, showing all the phases of silk productions, from the old looms and machinery to finished products. From 1997 San Leucio resort is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in Europe as part of the site 18th Century Royal Palace at Caserta with the Park, the Aqueduct of Vanvitelli and the San Leucio Complex. From 1999 in summer months at San Leucio the Leuciana Festival is held, to promote the Belvedere of San Leucio and its park. ==Bibliography== * The Architecture of Modern Italy: Challenge of Tradition, 1750‚Äì1900 by Terry Kirk ‚Äì ed.

Hixson announced her retirement in November of 2017. At the time, she was the longest-serving woman in the General Assembly.Express (Washington, D.C.), Nov. 21, 2017, p. 4. ==Political accomplishmentsEducation=== Hixson was a member of Maryland's \\"Thornton Commission\\" and one of the original supporters of the five-year Bridge to Excellence Plan for public primary and secondary education. Maryland became the first State in the country to endorse a comprehensive reform of its school finance system based on principles of adequacy and equity without being forced to do so by a court order. Once enacted, additional funds were included in the 2008 budget to accommodate the Geographic Cost of Education Index, a concept promoted by Hixson. This legislation allows localities to secure funds based on specific costs related to its county or locale. She has also sponsored bills to increase funding formulas for ESOL classes in the schools and for Adult English Language and Literacy education. Hixson has been a continuous sponsor of the Tuition Affordability Act which freezes in-state undergraduate tuition increases for 2006, 2007. The legislation was expanded further into 2008 by governor Martin O'Malley. ===Health=== Hixson spearheaded legislation for Universal Newborn Hearing Screening making Maryland the 13th state to mandate hearing testing for all babies born in the State. In addition, Hixson's legislation established the Hearing Aid Loaner Program and mandated insurance coverage for children's hearing aids. She sponsored the Spinal Cord Regeneration Trust fund to provide for research to develop new therapies to restore neurological function in individuals with spinal cord injuries, the Senior Prescription Drug Act, and a funding formula legislation for infants and toddlers. ===Social issues=== Hixson sponsored legislation to first provide for and then accelerate Earned Income Tax Credit for the Working Poor; filed the first bill ending discrimination based on sexual orientation; created a \\"living will\\" to provide advance directives; and sponsored the groundbreaking Maryland Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000 which made Maryland the first state to require that all handguns be sold with built-in locks. Also, Hixson was the original sponsor of the Healthy Maryland Initiative which raised the cigarette tax by $1 as a means to close a gap in Medicaid funding. This increase was added to the 2008 tax package. ===Elections=== Sheila Hixson sponsored legislation making Maryland the first state to enter into an Interstate Compact Agreement to Elect the President by Popular Vote which takes effect when signed by enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes necessary to elect a president. In the same year, Hixson sponsored legislation that provided a \\"voter-verifiable\\" paper trail ensuring a physical record of votes. ===Legislative notes=== * voted in favor of the Tax Reform Act of 2007 (HB2) * voted for the Clean Indoor Air Act of 2007 (HB359) * voted for the Healthy Air Act in 2006 (SB154) * voted for electric deregulation in 1999 (HB703) * voted for income tax reduction in 1998 (SB750) ==Awards== *2010- 20 Most Influential Maryland Legislators *2008 Champion of Working Families, Progressive Maryland *The Daily Record's Maryland's Top 100 Women(2000 and 2007) *Maryland's Top 100 Women's Circle of Excellence (2009) *AFL-CIO of Maryland Building and Construction Trades Council (Legislator of the Year, 1996) *Outstanding Leadership Award from the Woman Legislators of Maryland (1993) *American Heart Association, Heart & Torch Award (1998, 1999 & 2003) *The Smoke free Maryland Legislator of the Year (1999) *Louis L.

The authority owes its existence to a policy begun in the 1990s under the Liberal federal government of turning over the operation of major Canadian airports to locally based bodies‚Äîthough Ottawa retains ownership of the airports. In policy terms, this has process has been regarded as a mixed blessing. Authorities are undoubtedly more open and more responsive to users and to the communities around them than was the former operator, the Canadian federal Department of Transport (Transport Canada). One veteran Transport Canada employee quipped that federal oversight was so detailed that more constructive work and planning could be done in a 15-minute coffee break among airport authority managers than in six months of dealing with Ottawa! Federal government policy has been to burden airport authorities with high rents and other charges that force these authorities to apply user fees to passenger tickets in order to raise money for capital improvements. Depending on one's perspective, this is either the \\"user-pay\\" principle or shameless federal downloading of a federal responsibility.

He won two Irish League titles and played in Europe six times while with Glentoran before winning five Northern Ireland international caps while playing for Sheffield Wednesday. ==Management careerLinfield=== Roy Coyle became player-manager of Linfield in 1975. In his first couple of years at the club, Coyle got Linfield into the Irish Cup final but lost to Carrick Rangers A year later they lost in the Irish Cup final again, but this time to Coleraine F.C.. The Linfield board decided to give Coyle another chance and that decision proved to be one of the best decisions ever made in Irish League football. Roy Coyle won 31 trophies with Linfield and left the club in 1990 after his contract was terminated. ===Ards=== In 1990, Coyle was appointed manager of County Down club Ards after leaving Linfield but he resigned the following year. ===Derry City=== Coyle was appointed manager of Derry City in 1991. He stayed for two years and won the League of Ireland Cup. In 1993, Coyle left and returned to Ards. ===Return to Ards=== Coyle returned to the County Down side in 1993 and won two trophies, the County Antrim Shield and the Irish League Cup. Coyle stayed at the club for four years. ===Glentoran=== Roy Coyle shocked the Irish League by becoming the new manager of Glentoran after the sacking of Tommy Cassidy. Even though Coyle played for Glentoran, it took some of the fans a while to get used to him after managing their bitter rivals Linfield. Coyle brought that success he had with Linfield and became Glentoran's most successful manager ever by winning 16 trophies with Glentoran. In 2006, after winning the league, Glentoran started to have a string of poor results. The fans started to turn against Coyle and the players. Then an away match to Armagh City saw Glentoran crashing to a 5‚Äì2 defeat at Holm Park. At the final whistle, Glentoran fans booed the players and as Coyle walked by, some of the fans nearby shouted \\"Coyle Out!\\" Coyle resigned that evening. He was replaced by Newry City manager Paul Millar. ===Newry City=== Coyle swapped clubs with Paul Millar who went to be Glentoran's new manager. Coyle only stayed for a couple of months and decided to retire. A year later Coyle was linked to a move to Glenavon but the job went to former Cliftonville and Coleraine manager Marty Quinn. ===Return to Glentoran=== Coyle returned to Glentoran as the Club's Director Of Football when Scott Young was appointed as the new First Team Manager for the East Belfast club. Coyle took charge of the team during Glentoran's Europa League qualifications while Young was completing his coaching badges. On 14 January 2012, Young resigned from the club, and Coyle was put in charge for Glentoran's game away to Ballymena United a match where the Glens won 3‚Äì0 in his first game back at the helm. Coyle also agreed to be caretaker manager at the club until they appointed a new manager. Coyle was in charge of first team duties until 22 February when former Cliftonville manager Eddie Patterson was appointed new Glentoran boss. Coyle returned to his duties as Director of Football. After Eddie Patterson was sacked as Glentoran Manager on 17 October 2015, Coyle, still at the club in his role as Director of Football took the reins as Caretaker Manager once again whilst the club searched for a new manager. In August 2016 when Alan Kernaghan resigned as Glentoran manager, Coyle also returned to the role of Caretaker Manager. ===Managerial honours=== Coyle is the most successful manager in Irish League history and has won 50 trophies in a success-filled career, mostly with Linfield and Glentoran *Linfield (November 1975 - April 1990) 31 Trophies **Irish League (10) 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1981/82, 1982/83, 1983/84, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87, 1988/89 **Irish Cup (3) 1977/78, 1979/80, 1981/82 **Gold Cup (7) 1978/79, 1981/82, 1983/84, 1984/85, 1987/88, 1988/89, 1989/89, 1989/90 **Ulster Cup (4) 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1984/85 **County Antrim Shield (5) 1976/77, 1980/81, 1981/82, 1982/83, 1983/84 **Irish League Cup (1) 1986/87 **Tyler All-Ireland Cup (1) 1980/81 *Derry City (June 1991 - September 1993) 1 Trophy **League of Ireland Cup (1) 1991/92 *Ards (October 1993 - November 1997) 2 Trophies **County Antrim Shield (1) 1993/94 **Irish League Cup (1) 1994/95 *Glentoran (November 1997 - February 2006) 17 Trophies **Irish League (3) 1998/99, 2002/03, 2004/05 **Irish Cup (4) 1997/98, 1999/2000, 2000/01, 2003/04 **Gold Cup (3) 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2000/01 **County Antrim Shield (4) 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2001/02, 2002/03 **Irish League Cup (3) 2000/01, 2002/03, 2004/05 ==References== ==External links== * Roy Coyle Northern Irelan's Footballing Greats Category:Living people Category:1946 births Category:Association football midfielders Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:League of Ireland managers Category:Ards F.C. managers Category:Derry City F.C. managers Category:Linfield F.C. managers Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Glentoran F.C. managers Category:Linfield F.C. players Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Ballymena United F.C. players Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland Category:Newry City F.C. managers Category:Northern Ireland amateur international footballers ","title":"Roy Coyle"},{"id":"9146725","text":"Vrijberge was a municipality in the Dutch province of Zeeland, located on the island of Tholen. It existed until 1813, when it was merged with Oud- Vossemeer.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\\", KNAW, 2006. ==History== Like many other small municipalities in Zeeland at the time, Vrijberge owed its municipal status to the existence of an estate with judicial privileges. After the introduction of the municipal system by the French, almost all of these estates became separate municipalities. However, if no one was willing to keep up with the legal costs of a municipality (taxes etc.), it was merged with a neighbouring town. Vrijberge came into existence in the 18th century after some previously flooded areas were again turned into habitable land, through the erection of dykes. It was through the management of these polders that Vrijberge gained its own small administration. The area, like most of Tholen, was flooded during the 1953 North Sea storm flood. Vrijberge, with less than 50 inhabitants, had by then already ceased to be of any importance. Since 1970 the whole island of Tholen is administered as a single municipality. ==Heraldry== Because Vrijberge's municipality was so quickly dissolved, it never came to officially possess a coat of arms. The coat of arms of the former estate was horizontally divided, argent over gules, with a charge of three roses gules on the argent and three sheep argent on the gules. Based on these arms, a flag (an armorial banner) was later designed for Vrijberge.A.M.

Regions of Karelia, as traditionally divided. 14th century Vyborg Castle, the easternmost outpost of medieval Sweden, in Karelia. The 1774 Dormition of the Theotokos church, in Kondopoga, Karelia. Vyborg‚ÄîViipuri and its Karelian Isthmus setting, in 2010. The History of Karelia is about the cultural and geopolitical region of Karelia, in present-day eastern Finland and northwestern Russia in northern Europe. The Karelian people's presence can be dated back to the 7th millennium BC‚Äî6th millennium BC.From the History of Karelia - Official Government Site of the Republic of Karelia ==Prehistoric== Karelia is primarily within the Scandinavian and Russian taiga habitat and ecoregion, which was rich in natural resources for prehistoric people's food and shelter needs. The mining of copper in Karelia began between 1 AD and 1000 AD. The ethnic composition of Karelia at the end of the 1st millennium consisted of Finno-Ugrian tribes. ==13th centurySwedish‚ÄîNovgorodian era=== Karelia was bitterly fought over by Sweden and the Novgorod Republic during the 13th-century Swedish- Novgorodian Wars. The Treaty of N√∂teborg (Finnish: P√§hkin√§saaren rauha) in 1323 divided Karelia between the two. The Baltic Sea port city of Viborg (Finnish: Viipuri) became the capital of the new Swedish province, with the Fief of Viborg existing from 1320 to 1534. The Russians received East Karelia. Since the 13th century the Karelians have lived in the tension between the East and the West, between the Eastern Christianity of Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Christianity of Catholicism and then Lutheranism. ==18th centuryImperial Russian era=== The Treaty of Nystad (Finnish: Uudenkaupungin rauha) in 1721 between Imperial Russia and Sweden ceded most of Karelia, as the Vyborg Governorate, to Russia. The Treaty of √Öbo in 1743 between Sweden and Russia then ceded South Karelia to Russia. After Finland had been occupied by Russia in the Finnish War, parts of the ceded provinces 'Old Finland' were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Finland, in the Russian Empire. ==20th centuryIndependence era=== In 1917, with Finland's declaration of independence, Finland became independent and the border was confirmed in 1920 by the Russian‚ÄìFinnish Treaty of Tartu. This included the Finnish Viipuri Province in Karelia from 1917 to 1947. During the 1920s, Finns were involved in attempts to overthrow the Bolshevists in Russian Karelia (East Karelia), for instance in the failed Aunus expedition. These mainly private expeditions ended after the peace Treaty of Tartu. After the end of the Russian Civil War, and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, the Russian part of Karelia became the Karelian Autonomous republic of the Soviet Union (ASSR) in 1923. During Soviet Union's first five-year plan (1928 to 1932) tens of thousands of gulag prisoners were used to dig the White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal. In the years of the Stalin's Great Purge (1936 to 1938) around 6,000 people were executed in the woods at Sandormokh near the Solovetsky Islands.Gulag grave hunter unearths uncomfortable truths in Russia The Guardian, 2017 ===World War II=== In 1939 the Soviet Union attacked Finland starting the Winter War. The Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940 handed the eastern half of Finnish Karelia to the Soviet Union. About 400,000 people, virtually the whole population, had to be relocated within Finland. In 1941 Finland attacked the Soviet Union alongside the Axis powers as co-belligerents. The Finnish military administration in Eastern Karelia administered the region during 1941‚Äì1944. The ceding of the eastern half of Finnish Karelia to the Soviets caused considerable bitterness in Finland, which had lost its fourth largest city, Viipuri, its industrial heartland along the River Vuoksi, its Saimaa canal that connected central Finland to the Gulf of Finland, and its access to the fishing waters of Lake Ladoga (Finnish: Laatokka). The serious loss also made of an eighth of the Finnish population displaced refugees, without a chance of return to their Karelian homeland. ===Soviet era=== As a consequence of the peace treaty, the Karelian ASSR was incorporated with the Karelo-Finnish SSR 1941‚Äì1956, after which it became an ASSR again. Karelia was the only Soviet republic that was \\"demoted\\" from an SSR to an ASSR within the Russian SFR. Unlike autonomous republics, soviets republics had the constitutional right to secede. The possible fear of secession, as well as the Russian ethnic majority in Karelia may have resulted in its \\"demotion.\\" ===Russian Federation era=== In 1991 the Republic of Karelia was created out of the ASSR, in the Russian Federation. ==See also== *Karelian language *Karelians *Karelia (historical province of Finland) ==References== ==External links== *Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland‚Äîthis.is.FINLAND: \\"Tracing Finland's eastern border\\" ","title":"History of Karelia"},{"id":"9146776","text":"Antonio Villareal (January 17, 1880 ‚Äî February 12, 1945) was a Filipino jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. ==Profile== Born in Pampanga, Villa-Real was forced to interrupt his schooling at age 15 in order to work following the death of his father. In 1895, he travelled to Japan and unsuccessfully sought to enlist in the Imperial Japanese Army. After also failing to enlist in the French Foreign Legion in Algeria, Villa-Real finally enrolled in a Tokyo university, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1901.Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 126 He then moved to the United States before finally returning to the Philippines in 1904. Upon his return to the Philippines, Villa-Real passed the civil service examinations, allowing him to work as an interpreter and translator with the Bureau of Justice. He also studied law, and passed the bar examinations in 1909. Villa-Real continued working at the Bureau of Justice, this time as an attorney, until he was appointed as a trial court judge in 1916. He returned to the Bureau of Justice in 1921, this time as attorney-general from 1921 to 1925. Attorney-general Villa-Real was appointed to the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice on June 26, 1925, filling the vacancy caused by the elevation of Justice Ramon Avance√±a to the Chief Justiceship.

His first team debut came on 12 November 1977 in a Second Division match against Blackpool, in which he scored in the opening minute. Baker made only two further appearances that season, in which Southampton were promoted to the First Division. He was a hard-tackling, hustling type of player who could pass and shoot and was one of the most industrious performers in Southampton's successful quest to re-establish themselves in Division 1. In the 1978‚Äì79 season he established himself in the first team, making 22 League appearances in midfield, playing alongside Steve Williams, Alan Ball and Nick Holmes. Although Southampton played in the League Cup final in 1979, Baker only made one substitute appearance during the whole run, with either Trevor Hebberd or Austin Hayes generally being preferred. Over the next three seasons, he continued to be a regular in Saints' midfield, and in the 1980‚Äì81 season he was a virtual ever-present making 39 appearances (scoring 8 goals), now playing alongside Kevin Keegan and Mick Channon, as Saints finished in 6th place in Division 1, then their highest league finish. During his time at Southampton he was twice capped by England at under-21 level, playing against Norway and Romania in 1980. He made 113 League appearances for Southampton before being sold to John Bond's Manchester City for ¬£350,000 in the 1982 close season, as Lawrie McMenemy needed to raise funds to finance the signing of Peter Shilton. ===Manchester City=== Baker's Manchester City career started well; the team won four of their first five games, including a 2‚Äì1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in which Baker scored both goals, and City became early league leaders. However, the good form did not last and the season turned into a struggle in the bottom half of the table, culminating in relegation on the final day of the season. The 1983‚Äì84 season was a reasonably prosperous one for Baker as he scored 8 goals in 36 games, equalling the highest goal scoring return of his career, though Manchester City finished one place short of promotion. Injuries disrupted Baker's next season, in which he made 29 appearances in a promotion winning side. On his return to the top flight, Baker made few appearances ‚Äì nine in the 1985‚Äì86 season and thirteen in 1986‚Äì87. In 1987 Manchester City were again relegated, and Baker returned to Southampton on a free transfer, having made 135 Manchester City appearances in five years. ===Return to Southampton=== By now, Southampton were under the management of Chris Nicholl, and the \\"glory days\\" of McMenemy were becoming a distant memory. At first, Baker was again a first-choice player, making 36 appearances in 1987‚Äì88, alongside Jimmy Case, Glenn Cockerill, and Andy Townsend, with the emerging talents of Danny Wallace and Alan Shearer up front. Gradually, however, his career at Southampton was disrupted by injury, and in 1990 he went to Fulham on a free transfer after losing his place in midfield to Barry Horne. ==Managerial and coaching career== In 1988 Baker was the manager of Locks Heath Dynamos Youth Team. Winning the Portsmouth Lads League two years in a row and the Sperrings Intermediate Cup, Baker drew comparisons to a young Brian Clough. He had a brief spell in 1994 as manager at Petersfield Town and from 1995 to 2003 he was a coach with Carshalton Athletic. In 2005 became Youth Development Officer at Woking, under the management of former Southampton colleague, Glenn Cockerill. Glenn Cockerill departed in March 2007 and Graham Baker was appointed joint caretaker manager with club captain Neil Smith. He took over as caretaker manager at Woking on 2 April 2009, following the sacking of Phil Gilchrist. The club's relegation from the Conference National was confirmed on 21 April, while he was in charge. The following day, he was given the job permanently, but Baker left the club on 19 January 2011. Baker was appointed Head of Youth at Aldershot Town in 2011. ==Personal life== After retiring from football he became a driving instructor in Cheam. He was also a keen cricketer enjoying a spell with local side Old Tenisonians in 90s. He was Club Captain during his time at the club, his abrasive style showing heavy signs of life in professional sport. He enjoyed moderate success at the club before leaving to concentrate on his football coaching career. He is married to Erica and has three children, Oliver, Luke and Megan. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== *Profile on Football Heroes about first spell at Southampton *Profile on Football Heroes about spell at Manchester City *Profile on Football Heroes about second spell at Southampton Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Southampton Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Aldershot F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:English football managers Category:Woking F.C. managers Category:England under-21 international footballers ","title":"Graham Baker (footballer)"},{"id":"9146796","text":"The Rt.

The tog is a measure of thermal insulance of a unit area, also known as thermal resistance. It is commonly used in the textile industry and often seen quoted on, for example, duvets and carpet underlay. The Shirley Institute in Manchester, England developed the tog as an easy-to-follow alternative to the SI unit of m2K/W. The name comes from the informal word togs for 'clothing', which itself was probably derived from the word toga, a Roman garment. The basic unit of insulation coefficient is the RSI, (1 m2K/W). 1 tog = 0.1 RSI. There is also a US clothing unit, the clo, equivalent to 0.155 RSI or 1.55 tog, described in ASTM D-1518. A tog is 0.1 m2K/W. In other words, the thermal resistance in togs is equal to ten times the temperature difference (in ¬∞C) between the two surfaces of a material, when the flow of heat is equal to one watt per square metre. British duvets are sold in steps of 1.5 tog from 4.5 tog (summer) to 16.5 tog (extra-warm). The stated values are minimum, actual values may be up to 3 tog higher. These tog values assume that there is no duvet cover added that can trap air.

These can be used individually as summer (4.5 tog) and spring/autumn (9.0 tog). When joined together using press studs around the edges, or Velcro strips across each of the corners, they become a 13.5 tog winter duvet and as such can be made to suit all seasons. ==Testing== Launched in the 1940s by the Shirley Institute, the Shirley Togmeter is the standard apparatus for rating thermal resistance of textiles, commonly known as the Tog Test. This apparatus, described in BS 4745:2005, measures a sample of textile, either between two metal plates (for underclothing) or between a metal plate and free air (for outer layers). Each industry has its own specifications and methods for measuring thermal properties. The Shirley Togmeter is claimed to be unsuitable for duvets because the large scale of their quilted construction makes it impractical to obtain a representative sample of suitable size. BS5335 describes apparatus for duvet tog testing.This consists of a metal plate at least 1000 mm x 600 mm at skin temperature (33¬∞C) arranged to support the whole duvet, and a mechanism for measuring the air temperature above the quilt. This requires very precise control of the laboratory environment in order to get reliable results. BS 8510 describes tog testing for baby products, the concern here being to ensure that babies do not overheat, with a maximum tog rating of about 4. BS 8510 has since been withdrawn and replaced by BS EN 16781:2018. ==See also== *Clothing insulation == References == Category:Thermodynamics Category:Textiles Category:Units of measurement ","title":"Tog (unit)"},{"id":"9146810","text":"Jonas Hartzell McGowan Jonas Hartzell McGowan (April 2, 1837 ‚Äì July 5, 1909) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. McGowan was born in Smith Township, Ohio (then part of Columbiana County, now Mahoning County). He was the eighth of ten children of Samuel and Susan McGowan. His paternal Scotch- Irish ancestors had fled religious persecution and settled in Pennsylvania. His father was a pioneer in Columbiana County, Ohio, where he cleared a tract of government land and occupied it as a homestead. In 1854, Samuel moved his family to Orland, Indiana, where he died in 1860. McGowan's mother was of German descent and survived the father for another four years. McGowan's father was an abolitionist and his house served as a depot on the Underground Railroad. McGowan attended a seminary in Alliance, Ohio and the Orland Academy. He graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1861 and taught in the city schools of Coldwater, Michigan for one year. In 1862, he married Josephine Pruden, then preceptress at the High School in Coldwater. During the Civil War, McGowan served in the Fifth and Ninth Regiments, Michigan Volunteer Cavalry. In August 1862, he enlisted as a private in the Fifth Regiment and was soon promoted to Sergeant of his Company. In November 1862, he was made a Captain in the Ninth Regiment, and went into the field early in 1863. Their first service was chasing Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, who made incursions into southern Indiana and Ohio on Morgan's Raid. McGowan took part in the Battle of Salineville, which resulted in the capture of Morgan in July 1863, near Salineville, Ohio. He went into campaigns in East Tennessee with General Ambrose Burnside, until he was forced to resign in 1864 for reasons of poor health. McGowan returned to Coldwater, where he studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1867, and commenced practice. He served as prosecuting attorney of Branch County from 1868 to 1872. He was also director of the Coldwater school board for six years. He began serving as a member of the University of Michigan board of regents in 1870 and served until 1877 when he resigned after being elected to Congress. He also represented the 10th district in the Michigan Senate from 1873 to 1874. In 1876, McGowan was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 3rd congressional district to the 45th United States Congress. He was re-elected to the 46th Congress and served from March 4, 1877 to March 3, 1881. He declined to be a candidate for re- nomination in 1880. Jonas H. McGowan resumed the practice of his profession in Washington, D.C., until his death in 1909. He was interred in Oak Grove Cemetery, Coldwater, Michigan. ==References== *The Political Graveyard * Category:1837 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Michigan Category:Michigan state senators Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Regents of the University of Michigan Category:People from Mahoning County, Ohio Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:People from Orland, Indiana Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Jonas H.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4, 2007. It was written by Michael Price, and directed by Susie Dietter. Guest starring Meg Ryan as Dr. Swanson, Peter Bogdanovich as a psychiatrist and Andy Dick, James Patterson and Stephen Sondheim as themselves.Yokel Chords @ IMDb This also marked the return of director Susie Dietter who had taken a hiatus to work on Futurama and the film Open Season. This was her first episode in nearly nine years. It won the 2008 Annie Award for Music in an Animated Television Production. ==Plot== Marge oversleeps, and not having made the children's lunch for the day, Homer makes the lunches instead. However, he does not do a very good job - Lisa gets a drawing of a sandwich, Bart gets Grandpa's medication, and even these are mixed up. Bart decides to scare an alternative lunch out of his friends by making up a story about a cannibal cafeteria worker named Dark Stanley, who killed all the students in the cafeteria and put them in his kids' head soup after repeatedly being taunted for not graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was eventually hanged for his crimes. According to Bart, Dark Stanley's ghost haunts the site to repeat his act of murder on the current kids. At lunchtime, Bart pretends to be killed by Dark Stanley, leading all of the students to run screaming into the woods while he takes their lunches. Groundskeeper Willie is sent to fetch them all back, but he brings seven extra kids who are Cletus's children. Their names are Whitney, Jitney, Dubya, Incest, Crystal Meth, International Harvester, and Birthday.Cletus' Profile @ About.com Principal Skinner tells Superintendent Chalmers that the kids have been refused education in fear that they will lower test averages and cost the school federal funding (after SES has already lost state, county, and local funding), which Lisa overhears. To appease Lisa, Skinner and Chalmers appoint her tutor of the children. Lisa's initial tutoring efforts are unsuccessful and so she decides to take the children to downtown Springfield to introduce them to culture in the outside world. However, Lisa's plans are diverted when Krusty spots the kids singing, decides to use them as a musical act for his show, and offers them a contract, which Cletus signs with an \\"X\\" (in sharp contrast to his elegant signature in the episode \\"Sweets and Sour Marge\\"). Lisa is worried about the way that Krusty and Cletus are exploiting the children with their plans for a national bus \\"No-Collar Comedy Tour\\", so she sends an e-mail to Brandine, who is currently a soldier in Iraq. She arrives by helicopter to tell Krusty that the contract Cletus signed is null and void, as he is the father of only two of the seven children ‚Äî the one who cannot sing and the one who cannot ad-lib. Cletus then tells Brandine that they owe Krusty $12,000, but she assures him that they can live on that, and Cletus is happy to have things back to normal. Meanwhile, Skinner punishes Bart by having him spend five sessions with a qualified psychiatrist named Dr. Stacey Swanson (Meg Ryan) (Skinner was going to use the school psychiatrist, but after she freaked out about Dark Stanley, Chalmers decided Bart should see someone who was better qualified). Bart is initially unwilling, but Homer insists Bart goes through with it, mainly because there is a Chinese restaurant next door to the psychiatrist where he can get drunk. Initially dismissive, Bart develops a close bond with Swanson, who uses a Mad Libs-like game and violent video games to get Bart to open up about Homer's alcoholism and other matters. When his sessions end, Bart starts to miss the time he spent with her and enters into a state of depression in which he talks about his problems to an empty chair while lying in bed. He also peeks into her window and sees her counseling Milhouse, and hangs his head while biking in the rain when he looks through a window and sees her dancing with the owner of the Chinese restaurant. A worried Marge uses the funds she had been saving up for Homer's breast reduction surgery to get her son one more session with Swanson. Bart then reveals that Homer and Marge were young and not ready for parenting when he was born, and that he acts out largely so they will focus on him instead of fighting with each other (the theme of which would be revisited in \\"Postcards from the Wedge\\"); he also adds he got the name \\"Dark Stanley\\" in part because Homer used to hit him with a Stanley-brand hammer. Happy that he got everything off his chest, Bart leaves therapy feeling good, and upon seeing that Swanson is visibly saddened when he leaves, assures her they will see each other again. Swanson goes to see her own psychiatrist (Peter Bogdanovich) where she says she cannot stop thinking about Bart. It is revealed during this discussion that Dark Stanley is in fact real, and had killed her own son: the therapist believes Swanson is projecting onto Bart, though Swanson claims she is not ready to go into that. == Cultural references == * The musical number that plays during Bart's telling of 'Dark Stanley' is Suite Punta del Este, a song from the movie 12 Monkeys composed by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. * Lisa takes the Spuckler children to a cultural tour in downtown Springfield. The song that forms the backdrop soundtrack for the tour is \\"Cultural Things\\", a parody of \\"My Favorite Things\\" from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music (Cultural Things also echoes \\"Portobello Road\\" from another musical, Bedknobs and Broomsticks). There are several more references to The Sound of Music throughout the episode. In a sequence, Lisa takes the kids to an art film screening showing Luis Bu√±uel's Un Chien Andalou. The brief two- second sequence in The Simpsons shows the famous opening scene of the French movie, in which Simone Mareuil's eye is being opened by Bu√±uel. * The scene where Dr. Swanson goes to see a therapist is a reference to the TV show The Sopranos, where Dr. Melfi, a therapist herself, is treated by Dr. Elliot Kupferberg. Actor Peter Bogdanovich, who plays Dr. Kupferberg in The Sopranos, is the voice of Dr. Swanson's psychiatrist in this episode. == Reception == Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 6.2/10, stating, ‚ÄúThis episode of The Simpsons seemed to have a lot going for it. It had many of the ingredients -- lots of guest stars, a storyline loosely based on an existing musical -- that would normally make for a memorable outing, but when it was all over, the whole thing fell short of producing a stellar half-hour. Still, as is often the case with The Simpsons, there were plenty of great laughs, even if the episode as a whole was a bit choppy.‚Äù == References Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:Musical television episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about murder ","title":"Yokel Chords"},{"id":"9146831","text":"Nikos Boutzikos (, born 6 September 1989) is a Greek professional footballer who plays for Football League club Olympiacos Volos, for which he is captain. ==Career== Boutzikos is a product of Panathinaikos' youth team, and before being scouted by the club he played amateur football for clubs in Chalkidiki.

His father was a butcher. ==College career== Grossman was an outstanding tight end (and three-year starter) for the Temple Owls in the early 1970s. In 1972, he caught 23 passes for 349 yards and four touchdowns and Temple had a record of 5‚Äì4‚Äì0. The following year, Grossman was named Associated Press All-America third team and Temple notched a record of 9‚Äì1‚Äì0.

Grossman would play 3 more years with the Steelers before retiring, earning 4 Super Bowl rings for Super Bowl IX, Super Bowl X, Super Bowl XIII, and Super Bowl XIV. Grossman said that his nickname of \\"The Rabbi\\" referred to his Jewish ancestry and came from Dwight White, who was the authority for assigning such titles to the Steelers. He also said he never faced any anti-Semitism during his career, because ‚Äúin sports -- in my era and currently -- it really is the great melting pot,\\" he said. \\"If you ‚Äòbring game,‚Äô you‚Äôre fine.

Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India but used for subsistence by communities, and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned. Administration of such reserves would be through local people and local agencies like the gram panchayat, as in the case of communal forests. (See Communal forests of India) Community reserves are the first instances of private land being accorded protection under the Indian legislature. It opens up the possibility of communally owned for-profit wildlife resorts, and also causes privately held areas under non-profit organizations like land trusts to be given protection. (See Private protected areas of India) These protected area categories were first introduced in the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2002 ‚àí the amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.Article in The Hindu, December 8, 2002 These categories were added because of reduced protection in and around existing or proposed protected areas due to private ownership of land, and land use. A case in point was the Melghat Tiger Reserve where a large area was left unprotected due to private ownership. Amendments to the Wild life protection act in 2003, provided a mechanism for recognition and legal backing to the community initiated efforts in wildlife protection. It provides a flexible system to achieve wildlife conservation without compromising community needs.

Only one prototype was completed; the project was abandoned in favour of a jet aircraft. ==Design and development== The I.Ae. 30 \\"√ëanc√∫\\", named after an indigenous eagle of Patagonia, was designed by Italian engineer Cesare Pallavicino, who had come to Argentina in 1946. Pallavicino led a team of Argentine technicians and engineers in developing the concept of a high-speed escort fighter, intended to be operated in conjunction with the Avro Lincoln bombers used in the Argentine Air Force. The I.Ae. 30 had a metal structure, its powerplants consisted of two Rolls-Royce Merlin 604 engines, each developing 1,800 hp at 3,000 RPM, and four-bladed propellers. The armament would consist of six 20 mm Oerlikon automatic cannons mounted in the nose, although later plans called for 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannons as well as a 250 kg bomb under the fuselage and two batteries of five 83 mm rockets fitted underneath the wings. Nevertheless, the prototypes were unarmed. By the end of 1947, a contract was received for the first of three projected prototypes. On 9 June 1948 the first prototype was ready for ground tests and on 17 July 1948, the I.Ae. 30 took to the air for the first time, piloted by Captain Edmundo Osvaldo Weiss. ==Operational history== I.Ae.30 √ëanc√∫ during testing, c. 1948 The test results proved that the aircraft possessed good flying characteristics as well as meeting performance specifications. During a cross country flight, from C√≥rdoba to Buenos Aires, the √ëanc√∫ reached a level speed of 780 km/h, setting a new piston-engined speed record in South America, an achievement that has not been surpassed. Although the prototype was achieving design goals, the Fuerza A√©rea Argentina was already considering the jet I.Ae. 27 Pulqui I as their future fighter program. With official interest diminishing, in early 1949, the sole flying prototype was badly damaged in a landing accident when test pilot Carlos Ferm√≠n Bergaglio misjudged a landing and crashed. Although the pilot was uninjured and the aircraft could have been repaired, the Fabrica Militar de Aviones made a decision to abandon the project with the wrecked prototype, as well as the two unfinished prototypes still at the factory being scrapped. ==Variants== I.Ae.30 √ëanc√∫, c. 1948 The 3 variants of the I.Ae.30 ;I.Ae 30 √ëanc√∫: Fighter/Interceptor/Heavy fighter/Attacker variant, three prototypes built, one tested and crashed, two incomplete airframes later scrapped after the program was cancelled. ;I.Ae.30 Pallavicino I: Jet modification of the IAe-30 √ëanc√∫, also designed by Cesare Pallavicino, was to be a single-seat fighter plane in a class similar to the one of the Gloster Meteor. It featured the same fuselage as the normal IAe.30 √ëanc√∫ but its inline engine nacelles were replaced with jet engine nacelles each having a Rolls-Royce Derwent engine each producing 3.500 lb static thrust. Its cockpit was replaced with a lengthened one featuring a full metal nose instead of the glazed nose of the √ëanc√∫. It was to have four 20 mm Hispano-Suiza autocannons \\"in\\" the nose instead of the 6 20 mm autocannons featured on the √ëanc√∫ which were located \\"beneath\\" the nose.

It was to be a light bomber/attacker with two crew: a pilot and a navigator. The navigator was to be seated either in a glazed nose or behind the pilot (then with a solid nose). Armament included four 20mm Hispano-Suiza autocannons and two bombs of 900 or 1,000 kg each in an internal bomb bay. It could also carry twenty 75mm air-to-ground rockets.

This was before dissolution of parliament for the following general election to be held in 2008. The Pakistani legislature elected incumbent Pervez Musharraf by an overwhelming majority. The near-unanimous nature of Musharraf's victory was made possible by the absence of two key political opposition leaders, Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto. Nawaz Sharif had attempted to return to Pakistan before the election but was deported back into exile by the ruling government because of a gross violation of the agreement he had signed with the current regime to stay out of Pakistan and its politics for a period of ten years. Benazir Bhutto had also announced her intention to return to Pakistan for the elections but ultimately decided not to do so. It was widely assumed that her decision was the result of an arrangement she made with Musharraf. ==Candidates== Wajihuddin Ahmed has filed his candidacy to stand for a group of lawyers opposed to Musharraf, while the Pakistan Peoples Party fielded its vice president Ameen Faheem as a candidate, though he stated he would withdraw his candidacy if Musharraf were approved as a candidate. The Supreme Court decided on 28 September 2007 that Musharraf could stand in the election. On 29 September 2007, the Election Commission scrutinised the nomination papers of all 43 candidates. Musharraf and both of his major opponents (Ahmed and Fahim) were approved, along with three others; the official list of candidates was announced to be publicised on 1 October 2007. On 1 October 2007, a final list of five candidates was announced: * Pervez Musharraf, the incumbent, for the Pakistan Muslim League (Q); * Wajihuddin Ahmed, a former Supreme Court judge, for an association of lawyers opposed to Musharraf; * Ameen Faheem for the Pakistan Peoples Party; * Muhammad Mian Soomro, chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, as Musharraf's backup candidate; * Faryal Talpur, deputy mayor of the southern city of Nawabshah, as Fahim's backup candidate. ==Results== Musharraf overwhelmingly won the election on 6 October, though the opposition had boycotted the election and other candidates withdrew from the election. 80 opposition party members had resigned from parliament, protesting that Musharraf was running for re-election while remaining head of the army. The Pakistan Peoples Party, led by Benazir Bhutto, only abstained from the vote‚Äîa move that prevented the vote from being invalid. In the National parliaments, Musharraf received 252 votes, against Wajihuddin Ahmed's two votes and the results from the provincial parliaments were similar. Complete results were announced only 80 minutes after the five-hours-long voting process had been finished, with 685 of the 1,170 eligible lawmakers participating. The results were: * Pervez Musharraf: 671 votes * Wajihuddin Ahmed: 8 votes * Invalid: 6 votes The Supreme Court rejected all challenges to the legality of the election, with the last ruling made on 2007-11-22. ==International reaction== International reaction to the election has been mixed, with commentators praising the fact that Pakistan is moving in the direction of democracy but critics pointing out that, among other factors, the boycotting of the election puts its results into doubt. The George W. Bush administration has long supported Musharraf's administration for maintaining stability but expressed a concern that all parties need to take part in order for an election to be truly democratic. ==References== ==Literature== * Schoresch Davoodi & Adama Sow: The Political Crisis of Pakistan in 2007 - EPU Research Papers: Issue 08/07, Stadtschlaining 2007 ==External links== * Explanation of the electoral process on BBC News 2007 Category:2007 elections in Pakistan ","title":"2007 Pakistani presidential election"},{"id":"9147017","text":"The former Reggie Harrison (born January 9, 1951 in Somerville, New Jersey) is a former professional American football running back for four seasons in the National Football League for the Pittsburgh Steelers and St. Louis Cardinals.

He owned the bank Rothschild Fr√®res from 1967 to 1979, when it was nationalized by the French government, and maintained possessions in other French and foreign companies including Imerys. He was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1985.Vanity Fair ==Early life and education== Baron Guy de Rothschild was born in Paris, the son of Baron √âdouard de Rothschild (1868‚Äì1949) and his wife, the former Germaine Alice Halphen (1884‚Äì1975). He has three siblings. Guy's elder brother, √âdouard Alphonse √âmile Lionel (1906‚Äì1911), died at the age of four of appendicitis;The Whims of Fortune: The Memoirs of Guy de Rothschild he also had two younger sisters, Jacqueline and Bethsab√©e. Half of his great-grandparents were Rothschilds. He was a great-great grandson of the German patriarch of the Rothschild family Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743‚Äì1812), who founded the family's banking in the 18th century in Frankfurt, Germany. He grew up at his parents' townhouse on the corner of the rue de Rivoli and the Place de la Concorde in Paris (a property once occupied by Talleyrand and now the United States Embassy) and their country estate at Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res, 25 miles east of Paris. Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res is a massive house built to a design by Joseph Paxton in the 1850s, based on Paxton's earlier design of Mentmore Towers for Baron Mayer de Rothschild of the English branch of the Rothschild family. He was educated at the Lyc√©e Condorcet and Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, and by private tutors. He undertook military service with the cavalry at Saumur, and played golf for France. He won the Grand Prix de Sud-Ouest in 1948. ==Personal life== Guy de Rothschild married twice: *In 1937, he married a distant cousin, Baroness Alix Hermine Jeanette Schey de Koromla (1911‚Äì1982). Alix was the former wife of Kurt Krahmer and the younger daughter of Baron Philipp Schey von Koromla, the first Hungarian Jew to be made an Austrian noble.Jewish Encyclopedia: SCHEY, PHILIPP, BARON VON KOROMLA retrieved March 4, 2012 They had one child, David Ren√© de Rothschild (born 1942). Rothschild also raised his wife's daughters from her prior marriage to Krahmer, Lili and Bettina. They divorced in 1956. *In 1957, he married Baroness Marie-H√©l√®ne van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1927‚Äì1996). Marie-H√©l√®ne's first marriage to Count Fran√ßois de Nicolay‚Äîwith whom she had one son, Philippe de Nicolay‚Äîhad been dissolved in 1956. Like his first wife, she was a distant cousin, though in this case, a Roman Catholic. They had one child, Baron √âdouard de Rothschild (born 1957). After his second marriage, Guy de Rothschild renovated the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res, using it to put on lavish balls in the early 1970s, before donating it to the University of Paris in 1975. The same year, he bought the H√¥tel Lambert on the √éle Saint-Louis in Paris, the top floors of which became his Paris residence. ==Service in World War II== In 1940, as a result of the German occupation of France in World War II, Guy de Rothschild's parents and sister Bethsab√©e fled France and made their way to safety in New York City. Guy de Rothschild had enlisted in the French Army and was a company commander in the 3rd Light Mechanised Division during the Battle of France in early 1940. After fighting the Nazis at Carvin, he was part of the French Army that was forced to retreat to Dunkirk. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his actions on the beaches at Dunkirk, from where he was evacuated to England. He immediately returned to France, landing at Brest, and taking charge of the family's office at La Bourboule, near Clermont-Ferrand. Under the Vichy government, his father and uncles were stripped of their French nationality, removed from the register of the L√©gion d'honneur, and the family was forced to sell its possessions. Rothschild managed to persuade the buyers to grant options under which he would later be able to buy the family's interests back. He left France again, via Spain and Portugal, to join his parents in New York City. He joined the Free French Forces and boarded the cargo ship, Pacific Grove, to travel back to Europe. His ship was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943, and he was rescued after spending 12 hours in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In England, he joined the staff of General Koenig at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force near Portsmouth. ==Banking and business== Guy de Rothschild studied law at university then joined de Rothschild Fr√®res in 1931 when it was being run by his father and a cousin, Robert de Rothschild, who died in 1946. As part of his learning to manage the family's businesses, in 1933 he joined the executive board of their Northern Railway Company. At the end of World War II, Guy de Rothschild returned to the bank's offices at rue Laffitte in Paris in 1944. On his father's death in 1949, Guy de Rothschild took formal control of the business. Years later, Rothschild was on the cover of the 20 December 1963 issue of TIME magazine in a story that said he took \\"over the family's French bank during the disorder of war and defeat, changed its character from stewardship of the family fortune to expansive modern banking.\\" Following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Guy de Rothschild served as a director of the Banque de France. On his father's death, he also inherited part of Ch√¢teau Lafite-Rothschild but did not run it. Georges Pompidou, who would later become President and Prime Minister of France, was recruited by Guy de Rothschild from a job as a teacher, and worked for him from 1953 to 1962, during which time he became the general manager of the Rothschild bank. The bank diversified, from investment management under De Rothschild Fr√®res to the deposit-taking Banque de Rothschild, with branches throughout France. Guy was its president from 1968 to 1978. In 1968 Guy de Rothschild became a partner at N M Rothschild & Sons, London, while cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild was appointed a director of Banque Rothschild, Paris. ===Imetal S.A.=== In France, Rothschild developed the country's largest private uranium mining company, the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des Minerais d'Uranium. In 1961, Guy de Rothschild took over as Chairman of Imetal S.A. in which the family had a substantial stake. His involvement marked the first time any Rothschild had personally participated in the management of the business. Among its holdings, the international mining conglomerate owned Soci√©t√© Le Nickel (SLN) in New Caledonia. In 1969, SLN acquired Pe√±arroya, a Chilean based company which mined and processed lead, zinc and copper. Two years later SLN took over La Compagnie de Mokta, which specialized in iron, manganese, sand, gravel and uranium. Rothschild restructured the family's various mining interests, including Pe√±arroya which became part of SLN. ===Nationalization=== In the early 1970s the government of France began nationalizing a number of industries and after declaring nickel to be a vital market commodity, SLN's assets were nationalized in 1974 and placed under a new company, Soci√©t√© Metallurgique. The result left the Rothschild's SLN as a holding company with a fifty percent interest in Soci√©t√© Metallurgique. When the Rothschild's bank was nationalized in 1981 by the socialist government of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a discouraged Guy de Rothschild left France and moved temporarily to New York City. \\"A Jew under P√©tain, a pariah under Mitterrand, that's enough!\\" () he wrote in a frontpage op-ed in Le Monde in 1981. Following another change in government policy, in 1987 a new banking business was established by his son David and nephew √âric, who founded Rothschild & Cie Banque. ==Thoroughbred racing== Guy de Rothschild was a renowned breeder of Thoroughbreds as the family owns Haras de Meautry in Normandy. He inherited Ch√¢teau de Reux in the horse breeding area in Lower Normandy about 125 miles north of Paris. He produced prominent race horses, the most famous perhaps was Exbury. Guy de Rothschild chaired the association of racehorse breeders in France from 1975 to 1982. Among the major races Guy de Rothschild's horses won were:http://www.france-galop.com/All-the- races.233+M52087573ab0.0.html?&course;_id=3153&no;_cache=1‚Ññ_id=99 * Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe - (1) - Exbury (1963) * Grand Crit√©rium - (4) - Dragon Blanc (1952), Le G√©ographe (1953), Soleil (1965), Mariacci (1974) * Grand Prix de Paris - (4) - Vieux Manoir (1950), White Label (1964), Soleil Noir (1979), Le Nain Jaune (1982) * Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud - (3) - Ocarina (1950), Violoncelle (1951), Exbury (1963) * Poule d'Essai des Poulains - (3) - Guersant (1952), Cobalt (1953), Soleil (1966) * Poule d'Essai des Pouliches - (2) - Dictaway (1955), Timandra (1960) * Prix de Diane - (3) - Cerisoles (1957), Timandra (1960), Hermi√®res (1961) * Prix Ganay - (4) - Guersant (1953), Exbury (1963), Free Ride (1965), Diatome (1966) * Prix Jacques le Marois - (3) - La Bamba (1964), Luthier (1968), Kenmare (1978) * Prix Jean Prat - (2) - Tang (1962), Lightning (1977) * Prix Morny - (2) - Soleil (1965), Madina (1967) * Prix Royal-Oak - (3) - Ciel, oil√© (1949), Barbieri (1964), Lady Berry (1973) * Prix Saint-Alary - (2) - Scala (1965), Grise Mine (1984) * Prix Vermeille - (3) - Haltilala (1966), Paysanne (1972, dead-heat), Indian Rose (1988) ==Art collector== The French Rothschild family had long been collectors of art beginning with James Mayer de Rothschild made the first significant acquisitions. Notable in his collection, Guy de Rothschild inherited Jan Vermeer's The Astronomer. In 1940 the Nazis confiscated it from his father and sent it to Germany. In 1945 the painting was returned to the Rothschild family and acquired by the Louvre in 1983. ==Philanthropy== In 1950, Guy de Rothschild became the first president of the Fonds Social Juif Unifi√© (FSJU) (United Jewish Welfare Fund), the major French philanthropic agency for the Jewish community. In 1975, Rothschild and his wife donated the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res to the University of Paris. ==Death== Widowed in 1996, Guy de Rothschild died in 2007. ==Works== * The Whims of Fortune: The Memoirs of Guy de Rothschild by Guy de Rothschild.

A dual Irish‚ÄìAmerican citizen, Papp was born in Ohio and raised in Western Pennsylvania, where he attended high school and university. Early in his career, Papp was a member of the Pittsburgh Power, a professional team in the National Cycle League owned by Franco Harris. He also rode as a stagiare with Montgomery-Bell, but finished his career in 2006 riding for the Italian teams Partizan-Whistle and Team Bianchi- Cinghiale, after starting the year with Hong Kong-based Champion System. Papp was briefly a cycling author, writing about his experiences in the professional peloton, and was a featured diarist for the cycling news website cyclingnews.com.Papillon: The Joe Papp Diary 2006 Papp has also written training advice columns, product reviews, and route guides for biking in Pittsburgh. His work has appeared in publications including VeloNews, Winning Bicycle Racing Illustrated, The Ride, Bike Culture and Cycling Times. Papp earned a BA in History from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He won a Coro Fellowship in Public Affairs and was a graduate student in the Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, before he later pursued, and failed to obtain, an MBA at Chatham University. However, Papp's academic work and professional development were interrupted by his extensive involvement in multiple doping scandals in cycling, including those involving Floyd Landis, Kayle Leogrande, Frenchwoman Jeannie Longo, and Lance Armstrong. After cooperating on various cases with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Papp was sentenced in 2011 on two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs. ==Early life== Joe Papp was born in 1975 in the Cleveland suburb of Parma, Ohio to Joseph John and Marie Barbara Papp (n√©e Danek). A younger brother, David Anthony, was born in 1979, and the family lived together in Seven Hills, Ohio until October 1983, when they moved to the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Papp's father, a veteran of the US Army and graduate of the Cleveland State University Nance College of Business, was a systems analyst in the Fisher Body division of General Motors when his position was transferred. ==Cycling career== Papp began racing in 1989. In 1994, he joined the United States National Team. He competed internationally, including in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Chile, Cuba, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Macau, Monaco, Panama, Taiwan, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkey, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In 1999, he finished as the first American, and third overall, at the Univest GP. He was the 2002 NYC Championship and Superweek Stage Winner. He finished 3rd overall in the 2002 USCF Criterium Rankings for Elite Men, and first overall in 2003. He was first overall at the 2004 Vuelta a Habana del Este. In 2006, Papp won three stages and briefly led overall at the International 42nd Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey. As a result of his doping violation, Papp was disqualified from all results obtained after mid-2001. ==Doping== Suspension Papp served a two-year suspension from competitive cycling in 2006, after the International 42nd Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey. His urine sample had tested positive for metabolites of testosterone or its precursors (6Œ±-OH-androstenedione 6Œ≤-OH-androsterone), at a World Anti-Doping Agency- accredited lab in Ankara, Turkey. He was ineligible to compete in sanctioned cycling events from July 31, 2006 through July 31, 2008. Papp was \\"disqualified from all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to July 1, 2001,\\" despite testing positive only in 2006, and after having signed an agreement with the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that negated only results obtained after May 6, 2006. After testifying in the Landis affair, in an interview with Dr. Dawn Richardson in VeloNews, Papp admitted to an extensive doping regime, including anabolic steroids and EPO. He recounted that, in his final race of the season for Team Whistle in Italy, what should have been a routine tumble resulting in bruising and road rash, instead almost cost him his life. The combination of EPO and blood thinners led to hospitalization with internal bleeding, and he admitted to having a hematocrit level of 58. Landis affair Papp addresses the media. Rather than contesting his own doping case, Papp met with USADA officer Travis Tygart in early 2007, and agreed to testify in the USADA arbitration hearing examining Floyd Landis' positive result for testosterone at the 2006 Tour de France. He also revealed the identity of two corrupt American doctors who had prescribed him banned drugs. At the Landis hearing, Papp described how synthetic testosterone gel helped him to recover during multi-day stage races. USADA used this testimony to refute earlier claims by Landis' attorneys that testosterone could not help Landis win the 2006 Tour, and that he would be unlikely to use it if he knew the substance was detectable by testing. Papp rebutted both of these claims, saying it was easy to stay below the threshold of a positive test, and that the gel helped him greatly in recovering between stages. During the hearing, Papp acknowledged systematically doping under the guidance of medical professionals in the United States, Europe and Latin America. He admitted to using EPO, human growth hormone, cortisone, insulin, thyroid hormone, anabolic steroids and amphetamines. The testimony, while not fundamental to the arbitration panel's decision to uphold Landis's conviction, elicited a hostile response. In an interview published in VeloNews, Landis asked interviewer Neal Rogers, \\"Why did they [USADA] bring in Joe Papp? Who the f--k is that guy?\\" During the period he was testifying in the Landis case Papp was actively trafficking EPO and HGH. Leogrande affair In late 2008, Papp provided physical evidence, including photos and a hand-written note, in USADA's anti-doping case against Kayle Leogrande. Leogrande was given a two-year suspension, after the panel hearing his case found that Papp's corroborative evidence added weight to the testimony of Suzanne Sonye and Frankie Andreu, while contradicting Leogrande. Longo affair In September 2011, French sports daily L'√âquipe revealed that Patrice Ciprelli, husband and coach of multiple world champion Jeannie Longo, had purchased EPO from China via Papp for his wife. The events dated back to April 2007, with L'√âquipe publishing emails exchanges between Papp, a Chinese contact and Ciprelli. Papp himself confirmed the dealings in an interview with L'√âquipe and also documented the delivery of EPO to Yolande Ciprelli, a close relative of the couple who lives very near their home in the French Alps. \\"Ciprelli did not mention her name, but he talked of his wife,\\" Papp told L'Equipe. \\"I understood that Longo was the beneficiary of the EPO, based on the messages. But he insisted to pay for it himself and that the package should be sent to a third person.\\" Drug distribution On February 17, 2010 in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Papp appeared before the Hon. Gary L. Lancaster, Chief U.S. District Judge, and pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs, specifically HGH and Erythropoietin (EPO). According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton, the retail value of the transactions brokered by Papp between Shandong Kexing Bioproducts Corp. and over 180 international clients approached $80,000USD from September 2006 to September 2007 None of the 187 customers, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, triathletes, mixed-martial artists and rowers, were identified in court. Houghton, Papp, and his attorney, William Ward, declined to comment on terms of the plea agreement, which had been sealed by the court ‚Äì a measure often taken if a defendant is cooperating with the government in ongoing investigations, but neither Ward nor Houghton would say at the time if that was the case. In October 2011, Papp was finally sentenced to serve a six-month period of house arrest, followed by two and half years probation.Joe Papp's long and winding road ==Career after cycling== Before his felony criminal convictions for conspiracy to distribute drugs, Papp spoke publicly about the dangers of doping. He has been quoted in Scientific American, the Wall Street Journal, the International Herald Tribune, and the New York Times. He also appeared as a guest on the National Public Radio Talk of the Nation program, and was featured in Outside magazine. ==Other== Papp earned a BA in History (summa cum laude) from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1999. Papp was a Coro Fellow in Public Affairs and graduate student in Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs Heinz College (2000‚Äì2001). He considered pursuing a career with the Central Intelligence Agency, and interviewed for a position in the Directorate of Operations in 2000, but returned to professional cycling in 2001. In October 2004, Papp married champion Cuban cyclist Yuliet Rodr√≠guez Jim√©nez, but they have been separated since December 2006. Since his suspension for doping, Papp has delivered guest lectures on the topics of supplement use by athletes and gene-doping at Slippery Rock University and at Chatham University, where he is pursuing an MBA and served in the Graduate Student Assembly. In July 2017, Papp joined a group of Twitter users suing U.S. President Donald Trump for blocking them from his personal @realDonaldTrump account. ==Palmar√®s== ;2006 *1st Granfondo Giro di Terra D'Otranto *1st Granfondo Pinarello *1st KOM competition - Granfondo Max Lelli, Italy *1st 2 Stages - International Presidency Tour of Turkey (UCI 2.2) *2nd Granfondo Citt√† di Ceriale, Italy *2nd Stage 2 - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *2nd Stage 13 - Vuelta a Cuba (UCI 2.2) *2nd Stage 6 - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *2nd Stage 5 - International Presidency Tour of Turkey (UCI 2.2) *2nd Stage 7 - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *2nd Points Classification - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *3rd Granfondo Valli Parmensi *3rd Medio Fondo Portofino Kulm *3rd Stage 10 - Vuelta a Cuba (UCI 2.2) *4th Granfondo Selle Italia Prestigio, Italy *4th Granfondo Claudio Chiappucci \\"Giro Valli dell'Alto Verbano\\" *4th Stage 3 - International Presidency Tour of Turkey (UCI 2.2) *4th Granfondo Umbria Verde, Italy *5th Stage 4 - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *5th Points Classification - Vuelta a Cuba (UCI 2.2) *6th Stage 2 - Volta de Ciclismo Internacional do Estado de S√£o Paulo (UCI 2.2) *6th Martin Luther King Classic Criterium *7th Granfondo Michele Bartoli *7th 5 Stages - Vuelta a Cuba (UCI 2.2) *8th Stage 3 - Tour of South China Sea (UCI 2.2) *10th Granfondo del Lambrusco Ceci, Italy *19th General Classification - Vuelta a Cuba (UCI 2.2) ==See also== * List of doping cases in cycling * List of doping cases in sport * List of Phi Beta Kappa members by year of admission ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Joe Papp Official Twitter * Cyclingnews.com - \\"Papillon: The Joe Papp Diary\\" Archives * Interview on Vimeo Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American male cyclists Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:American sportspeople in doping cases Category:American cycling coaches Category:People from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:University of Pittsburgh alumni Category:People from Parma, Ohio Category:People from Seven Hills, Ohio ","title":"Joseph M.

In The Nation, Harold Clurman paid it the back-handed compliment of calling it an example of how the \\"deterioration of the Broadway theatre may be discerned in the fact that inconsequential scripts are frequently done more competently than serious ones\\"; Clurman, too, singled out Arkin for praise. Arkin won both the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play and the Theatre World Award for his performance. ==Adaptations== Reiner co-wrote the screenplay with Stein for the 1967 film version, directed by Reiner and starring Reni Santoni as David, Jos√© Ferrer as Marlowe, Shelley Winters as Mrs. Kolowitz, and Elaine May as Angela. The play served as the basis for the ill-fated 1976 musical So Long, 174th Street. Enter Laughing was revived Off-Broadway as a musical in 2008 by The York Theatre Company. With music and lyrics by Stan Daniels, the production starred Josh Grisetti for a limited run. The New York Times praised the revival as \\"hilarious\\" and Variety reviewer Steven Suskin wrote that \\"portions bordered on the hysterical\\". Like Arkin in 1963, Grisetti won the 2009 Theatre World Award for his performance. Enter Laughing: The Musical was revived again Off-Broadway by The York Theatre Company in 2019; running from May 7, 2019-June 23, 2019. The 2019 revival featured: Raji Ahsan, Farah Alvin, Dana Costello, Ray DeMattis, Chris Dwan, Alison Fraser, Magnes Jarmo, Michael Kostroff, Paul Kreppel, Robert Picardo, Nathan Salstone, David Schramm, Allie Trimm and Joe Veale. ==References== ==External links== * *Enter Laughing at the Internet Off Broadway Database * Enter Laughing Enter Laughing Category:Autobiographical plays Category:American plays adapted into films Category:Plays set in New York City Category:Fiction set in the 1930s Category:Biographical plays about actors Category:Plays based on novels ","title":"Enter Laughing"},{"id":"9147232","text":"Once Upon a Time in China V is a 1994 Hong Kong‚ÄìChinese martial arts action film written and directed by Tsui Hark.

The film also saw the return of Hark as director (he only co-wrote and produced the fourth film) and of Rosamund Kwan as \\"13th Aunt\\", who was absent in the fourth film. ==Plot== After the armies of the Eight-Nation Alliance occupy Beijing, the collapse of the Qing Dynasty is imminent. Wong Fei-hung and his companions return to Foshan in southern China and prepare to move to Hong Kong (then a British colony). In the meantime, Wong Fei-hung develops a love triangle with his romantic interests \\"13th Aunt\\" and \\"14th Aunt\\". When they arrive at the port town, they see that the town is in a desolate state, as the authorities have fled with all the public funds, leaving the local army garrison without any money or food. The situation worsens with the presence of pirates, who terrorise the coast and seal off the sea route. Wong and his companions decide to form a local crime prevention force to deal with the threats, leading to three confrontations with the pirates and eventual victory for the protagonists.

Chilton moved to Washington, D.C., by 1853 and became a member of American Party, or Know-Nothings. In 1859 he was appointed as a defense attorney for abolitionist John Brown after his previous defense attorneys advocated that the defendant advance a plea of insanity as his defense.

He is part of a large extended Italian- American family, some of which reach back four generations in California. Martini‚Äôs mother and father moved to Los Angeles County, California in 1956. His father, Ernest Martini, was a rancher, managing and owning farms throughout California during his lifetime. His mother, Rita, was a housewife and homemaker, though in later years she worked extensively in the local library in San Gabriel, California. Martini graduated from San Gabriel Mission Grammar School, San Gabriel High School and Pasadena City College before transferring to the University of California at Santa Cruz where he graduated in 1968 with a degree in Government (Political Science). == Professional and legal career == Martini's first career was in journalism. He worked as a newspaper reporter for the Los Angeles Daily Journal, the largest legal newspaper in the country covering the state, the local courts and the civic center beat. In 1970 he became the newspaper‚Äôs first correspondent at the State Capitol in Sacramento and later its bureau chief. There he specialized in legal and political coverage. During this period he attended night law school and in 1974 took his J.D. degree from the University of the Pacific‚Äôs McGeorge School of Law. He was admitted to the Bar in January 1975. Martini has practiced law both privately as well as for public agencies appearing in state and federal courts. During his law career, in addition to other activities, he worked as a legislative representative for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the State Bar of California, and served as special counsel to the California Victims of Violent Crimes Program. He has worked as an administrative hearing officer, a supervising hearing officer, an administrative law judge, and for a time served as Deputy Director of the State Office of Administrative Hearings. He is currently inactive with the State Bar of California, choosing writing instead as a full-time occupation. == Writing career == In the mid-1980s Martini began his fiction-writing career. His first attempt at a novel, The Simeon Chamber, was represented by an agent and sold to the New York publisher D.I. Fine within two weeks of its submission. It was published in 1987. Compelling Evidence, his second novel, introduced his series character, attorney Paul Madriani, and was published by G.P. Putnam & Sons. A national bestseller, the novel earned Martini a critical and popular following. It was followed quickly by New York Times bestsellers Prime Witness, Undue Influence, The Judge, and The Attorney, each featuring the series character Madriani and his contrarian and irrepressible law partner, Harry Hinds. The List, published in 1997, a novel and thriller about the commercial book publishing industry, was the first Martini novel to depart from the series characters since the author reached the best sellers list. Critical Mass, his next novel published in 1998, continued the departure from the courtroom as well as the Madriani series, though it involved a lawyer protagonist and was well within the legal-thriller genre. Critical Mass addressed issues of terrorism and the threat from weapons of mass destruction two years before the events of 9/11. It was a topic to which Martini would return in later years. Other novels by Martini include: The Jury, The Arraignment, Double Tap, Shadow of Power, Guardian of Lies, The Rule of Nine, and Trader of Secrets. To date, two network mini-series have been produced and broadcast based on Martini‚Äôs works, Undue Influence by CBS, and The Judge on NBC. ==Personal life == Steve Martini was previously married to the former Wanda Leah Martini, now Leah Martini-Puhlman.Leah Martini Puhlman They have one daughter.

He is a clinical professor at the Yale Child Study Center. His most notable contribution to the field came in 1981, when he published his book, The Family's Construction of Reality. ==Family construing== The term \\"family paradigm\\" is used by the author to define a set of shared beliefs and views that every family has, even though they are mainly present at a subliminal level. His research started off as a way to investigate whether some aspects of family life had influences over the development of schizophrenia in the offspring of the family. Three different types of families were participants in numerous experiments: families without any psychopathological diagnosis, families with offspring (age 12 to 30) who had character disorders, and families with offspring that had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Preliminary studies showed that families, when given tasks that dealt with gathering, interpreting and communicating information, differed from one another in ways that could be interpreted as an extension of George Kelly's concept of personal construct, thus becoming shared constructs. Reiss states that shared construing always happens, and follows very specific interaction patterns that the family has carefully but subconsciously created throughout its life. The types of constructs the family forms are directly derived from the interaction of three polar variables: *Configuration (ability to grasp the complexity of patterns underlying in the environment, going from \\"subtle, detailed or highly structured\\" to \\"coarse, simple or chaotic\\"); *Coordination (which \\"refers to family member's ability and willingness to develop problem solutions similar to each others\\",); *Closure (which \\"refers to the family's proclivity for suspending or applying order and coherent concepts to raw sensory experience\\",). By crossing these variables we could possibly obtain eight different types of families, but the authors investigate only four possible configurations, thus dividing families on the basis of their shared construing of the laboratory experience: *Environment-sensitive families (families without psychopathology, scoring high on all three dimensions) *Consensus- sensitive families (families with schizophrenic offspring, scoring high on coordination, but low on both closure and configuration) *Distance-sensitive families (families with delinquential or characterial problems, scoring low on all three dimensions) *Achievement-sensitive families (families characterized by a very high competitivity between its members, scoring high on both configuration and closure, but low on coordination). ==Family paradigm and crisis== According to Reiss, the family has underlying patterns imbued in itself, which shape these family constructs; the author calls these patterns \\"family paradigms\\". They are built through family crisis; when a family enters a state of dissonance that threatens to destroy it, some parts of its paradigm become obsolete, while others rise to help the family get out of the crisis; those parts of the construct that survive the crisis become so relevant and strongly embedded in the life of the family, that they become organizers of the life of the family from that point on, up to the next crisis. Family paradigms differ, much like constructs, on three dimensions: * Coherence (referred to the way the family perceives the world: stable or intrinsically moving) * Integration (referred to how the family perceives the access its members have to the processes underlying in the environment: universal means the family as a whole can access them, particular means the single members may have access) * Reference (referred to the conception of where the stimuli come from: from the outside world, or from inside the family) The paradigm, then, is the kernel of each family's shared construing of every social situation, and it serves as an organizer of every aspect of its life, even though it operates mostly at a subliminal level. It is preserved, even over long periods of time, by means of two kinds of processes: ceremonials (which are highly emotional, symbolic, episodic rituals performed by the family as a whole), and pattern regulators (which, on the other hand, are non-symbolic, delegatable, continuous routines). Thus, through the routinization of time and space, the family paradigm is constantly reasserted, and thus kept alive. ==Cycle hypothesis== The process that goes through the crisis, undermines the old paradigm and shapes a new one, which in turn will allow the family a new set of shared constructs, is circular. Shared constructs, in fact, will shape interaction patterns with each family's social environment, thus creating the basis for new links with specific environments, which will again modify the shared constructs the family has built. ==References== Category:American psychiatrists Category:1937 births Category:American Jews Category:Living people Category:George Washington University faculty Category:Yale University faculty ","title":"David Reiss (psychiatrist)"},{"id":"9147347","text":"Edward \\"Ed\\" Liddy (born January 28, 1946) is an American businessman who was chairman of The Allstate Corporation from 1999 to 2008. In September 2008, at the request of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Liddy agreed to serve as interim chairman and chief executive officer of American International Group, Inc. (AIG). His placement in the role was one of numerous government actions to provide stability to U.S. financial firms during the global financial crisis. Liddy requested a salary of just $1 a year. ==Early life== Liddy was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. After the death of his father in 1959, he moved to Clearwater, Florida with his mother and older sister. He was a member of the first graduating class of Clearwater Central Catholic High School in 1964. He earned his bachelor's degree from the Catholic University of America (1968) and MBA from George Washington University (1972). ==Career== Liddy began his career as a financial analyst with Ford Motor Company in 1972. He joined G.D. Searle & Co., and its CEO Donald Rumsfeld, in 1979, eventually becoming CFO. Upon the sale of Searle to Monsanto, he served from 1986 to 1988 as executive vice president and a member of the board of directors of ADT, Inc.. ===Sears, Roebuck and Co.=== Upon the sale of ADT, Liddy joined Sears in April 1988 and served in a variety of financial and senior operating roles before being named chief financial officer in February 1992. In that role, he was the architect and implementer of the successful restructuring of Sears, which involved breaking the company into numerous public companies (Sears, The Allstate Corporation, Dean Witter) and selling non-core assets (Homart Development Company, Coldwell Banker Residential Broker, Sears Mortgage and Sears Savings Bank). He led the 1993 initial public offerings of Dean Witter/Discover and Allstate, two of the largest IPOs ever done at that time. He also led the 1995 spinoff of Allstate from Sears. ===The Allstate Corporation=== After the IPO of Allstate, Liddy held positions of increasing responsibility with The Allstate Corporation, the largest publicly held personal lines property and casualty insurer in America, from 1994 to 2008. He served as chairman from January 1999 until his retirement in April 2008. He was chief executive officer from January 1999 until December 2006, and president and chief operating officer from August 1994 to December 1998. Under Liddy‚Äôs leadership, the company was streamlined by exiting non-core businesses and the company expanded its distribution system beyond its traditional agency force to reach customers through the internet and call centers. During Liddy‚Äôs tenure as president and then CEO, Allstate‚Äôs market value more than tripled, from $11 billion (Dec. 31, 1994) to over $40 billion (Dec. 31, 2006). ===American International Group=== In September 2008, at the request of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Liddy agreed to serve as interim chairman and chief executive officer of American International Group, Inc. (AIG). His placement in the role was one of numerous government actions to provide stability to U.S. financial firms during the global financial crisis. He requested a salary of just $1 per year. The restructuring of AIG that Liddy took on was one of the largest in U.S. corporate history. He and the AIG team developed a strategy to stabilize the company and its $1.2 trillion balance sheet; keep the company out of bankruptcy; repay with interest all money invested in the company by various U.S. government entities, which eventually totaled $182 billion; and keep the remaining business that would comprise AIG vital and competitive. The government bailout of AIG garnered national headlines in May 2009 when AIG, with the concurrence of the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve, paid earned bonuses to employees of its Financial Products Business, determining the payments were contractual obligations. Liddy noted that ‚Äúhonoring contractual commitments is at the heart of what we do in the insurance business.‚Äù At the same time, he urged the employees who received $165 million in bonuses to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and return at least part of their bonus.\\" Once the company was stabilized, a viable plan in place to repay the government assistance and a management team partially in place to execute the strategy, Liddy announced on May 21, 2009 he would resign as AIG chairman and CEO when replacements were found. He suggested the two roles be split. In August 2009, Robert Benmosche took over as CEO and Harvey Golub as chairman.

The GTM Research Reserve represents the east Florida sub-region of the Carolinian bioregion. It is one of 29 NERRs in 23 states and one territory. GTM is one of three NERRs in Florida, and is administered on behalf of the state by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Florida Coastal Office as part of a network that includes forty- one aquatic preserves, three NERRs, a National Marine Sanctuary, the Coral Reef Conservation Program and the Florida Oceans and Coastal Council. Additional interests are held in the research and management of the GTM and connected preserved or conserved lands including: * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration * Friends of the GTM * Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission * Florida and US Department of Environmental Protection * University of North Florida, Whitney Laboratory, Marineland * State, National, Federal, Cit park systems * St. Johns River Water Management District * State and Federal Forestry Service ==Overview== The GTM Research Reserve boundary encompasses 76,760 acres along the Guana, Tolomato and Matanzas rivers, and the Atlantic Coast. Its mission is \\"to achieve the conservation of natural biodiversity and cultural resources by using the results of research and monitoring to guide science-based stewardship and education strategies.\\"http://gtmnerr.org/documents/Volunteer/EdJobs/GTMDocentSeries.pdf The GTM Research Reserve was officially designated on August 19, 1999. A portion of the GTM Research Reserve north of St. Augustine, Florida was formerly known as Guana River State Park. The upland areas include pine flatwoods, maritime hammock, coastal strands and dunes, and mangroves. It is also an important calving ground for the endangered North Atlantic right whale, in addition to being home to aquatic and amphibious wildlife like dolphins, manatees, sea turtles, gopher tortoises, American alligators, indigo snakes and river otters. There are also peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and the endangered Anastasia Island beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus phasma). Diving and wading birds such as brown and white pelicans, wood storks, and roseate spoonbills can also be viewed. ==GTM Research Reserve Visitor Center== The GTM Research Reserve Visitor Center is located at 505 Guana River Road in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. It is in the northern component of GTM Research Reserve, ten miles north of St. Augustine on State Road A1A in Ponte Vedra Beach, and serves as the administrative, education, research and stewardship facilities for the northern component of GTM Research Reserve. The southern component of GTM Research Reserve consists of Pellicer Creek Aquatic Preserve, Faver-Dykes State Park, Washington Oaks Gardens State Park, Moses Creek Conservation Area, Pellicer Creek Conservation Area, Fort Matanzas National Monument, Matanzas State Forest, Princess Place Preserve, The River to Sea Preserve at Marineland, Marsh View Preserve, and other state sovereign submerged lands adjacent to the Matanzas River within its boundary. There is a smaller office building on A1A within the River to Sea Preserve in Marineland. Family walking on one of GTM Research Reserve's trails ==Recreational activities== There are a lot of recreational activities available like hiking, bicycling, fishing, kayaking and canoeing, dog walking, horseback riding, picnicking, bird watching and nature viewing. Amenities include over nine miles (14 km) of nature trails in an unspoiled natural setting. The reserve also contains seventeen archaeological sites, shell middens at Shell Bluff Landing and Wright's Landing, as well as a prehistoric earthen burial mound. Kayak, bicycle, and fishing boats are available for rent to explore the reserve. North Guana Oupost Operates a rental and tour service on site. ==History== The tract was privately owned and open to the public for hunting and fishing prior to state acquisition. During the period of private ownership, the Guana River was dammed in 1957, to flood the upstream marshes in order to enhance wintering waterfowl habitat. The result was the creation of the present-day Guana Lake. The lake water is brackish near its southern terminus at Guana Dam and gradually turns into a freshwater reservoir as one travels away from the dam. Both saltwater and freshwater fish species exist in the same body of water. The land was purchased from Gate Petroleum with Conservation and Recreational Lands and Save Our Coast funds by the State of Florida in 1984 and divided into Guana River State Park and the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. In 2004 with the construction of the GTM Environmental Education Center, the management of the state park lands was turned over to the GTM Research Reserve to manage as part of the larger research reserve. ===Guana Tract=== In 2004 the Guana River State Park was acquired by the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve and is now included in the reserve. It is no longer a State Park. The research reserve is located along State Highway A1A, between St. Augustine and Jacksonville. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway (Tolomato River), the Guana Tract, which includes the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve (GTM Research Reserve) and Guana River Wildlife Management Area, comprises some of public conservation and recreational uplands. ==See also== *Saint Johns River *Matanzas River ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Friends of the GTM Reserve - GTM Research Reserve Environmental Education Center * Guana River Reserve at Wildernet * Guana Tolomato Matanzas Reserve, Florida * Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve Category:Protected areas of Flagler County, Florida Category:Estuaries of Florida Category:Lagoons of Florida Category:Marshes of Florida Category:Wetlands of Florida Category:Protected areas of Florida Category:Protected areas of St. Johns County, Florida Category:National Estuarine Research Reserves of Florida Category:Nature centers in Florida Category:Landforms of St. Johns County, Florida Category:Landforms of Flagler County, Florida Category:1999 establishments in Florida Category:Protected areas established in 1999 ","title":"Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve"},{"id":"9147515","text":"Westkerke is a hamlet in the southwest Netherlands.

Fran√ßois Weyergans was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 26 March 2009, taking the 32nd seat which became vacant with the death of Alain Robbe-Grillet in 2008. ==Biography== He started film studies at the IDHEC (Hautes √âtudes Cin√©matographiques), where he came to love the films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard, among others. He soon began to write for Cahiers du cin√©ma and directed his first film in 1961, on Maurice B√©jart, which led to his expulsion from the school as students were banned from making professional films. ==Novels== After having been through some psychoanalysis, he published a satirical account of his treatment in a novel called Le Pitre (1971), which attracted some critical notice and won the Roger Nimier Prize. His second novel in 1981 was Macaire le Copte. This won the Prix Rossel in his native Belgium, as well as the Prix des Deux Magots in France. From then on, Weyergans devoted himself entirely to writing, spending whole nights working from 11 p.m. until noon. His subsequent works‚Äîmostly of an ironic autobiographical nature‚Äîalso won literary prizes, including the \\"Prix M√©ridien des quatre jurys\\" in 1983 for Le radeau de la M√©duse and the Prix Renaudot in 1992 for La d√©mence du boxeur. Most recently, his Trois jours chez ma m√®re awarded him the Prix Goncourt in 2005. In this, he satirises his own famous difficulties in delivering a promised manuscript in time. In the process he creates a \\"Russian doll\\" type structure where he (Weyergans) writes as a writer, Weyergraf, who finds all sorts of distractions or reasons to avoid writing a book called Trois jours chez ma m√®re. He does this largely by inventing an author called Graffenberg, who in turn invents another author, Weyerstein, who sketches out a possible structure‚Äîbut he keeps getting waylaid by humorous meditations on his own life, love (or just encounters), family, films and multiple enthusiasms and interests. ==Films== * 1962: B√©jart * 1963: Hieronymus Bosch * 1965: Robert Bresson: Ni vu, ni connu (des portraits Cin√©astes de notre temps), 65 minutes * 1967: Baudelaire is gestorven in de zomer * 1967: Aline * 1972: Un film sur quelqu'un * 1977: Maladie mortelle * 1977: Je t'aime, tu danses * 1978: Couleur Chair (Flesh Color) ==References== ==Further reading== * Gardies, Andr√© (1972) Alain Robbe-Grillet.

She has received the UNESCO/Institut Pasteur Medal (1997), the L'Or√©al-UNESCO Award for Women in Science (2006) served as rector of the Autonomous University of Mexico City (UACM) and has run for governor of Chihuahua representing the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). Orozco received a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the Autonomous University of Chihuahua and both a master's degree and a doctorate's degree in cell biology from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (Cinvestav). She has worked at the Institute of Experimental Pathology of the same institution, co-founded of the Center for Scientific Research and Applied Technology and, from December 2006 to April 2010, served as director of the Institute for Science and Technology of Mexico City. As a visiting scholar, she has lectured at Harvard University and the Weizmann Institute of Science. Politically she is affiliated with the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, for which she ran unsuccessfully for governor of Chihuahua in 1998. She is also a prominent pro-choice activist in the Mexican capital. ==Autonomous University of Mexico City== Orozco served as rector of the Autonomous University of Mexico City (UACM) from 21 April 2010 to 13 March 2013, when she was ousted by 25 dissenting members of the administrative board; a group that consisted of nine students representatives, fifteen academics and a member of the staff. According to the Associated Press, during her rectorate she had tried to reduce the inefficiencies and low graduation rate of the university, as only a few dozen of its nearly 15,000 students had actually graduated since the institution was founded eleven years before, 52% had a grade average lower than 2.5 out of a 10-point scale and academics routinely prevented external evaluation. However, her proposals were resisted by members of the staff and student community, who claimed that a previous election for the university's administrative board was rigged and accused her of corruption and financial mismanagement. After months of protests, and despite her ratification by 28 members of the board, dissenting members appointed Marxist philosopher Enrique Dussel as substitute; a measure supported days later by the Executive, the Legislative Assembly and Human Rights Commission of Mexico City through a jointly signed letter. == Selected Publications == * Debnath, A., Parsonage, D., Andrade, R.

This is the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. In the 1883 Atlantic season there was one tropical storm, one Category 1 hurricane, and two major hurricanes (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite monitoring and remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. __TOC__ ==Season summary== The Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) recognizes four tropical cyclones for the 1883 season. In 1883 there was one tropical storm, one Category 1 hurricane and two major hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. Due to the inactivity of the season, there were no storms in June, July or November. Both Hurricane One and Hurricane Two were active in the Western Atlantic throughout the second half of August. Although Hurricane One was the only storm of the year not to make a landfall, it did cause 80 deaths among seafarers off Newfoundland. Hurricane Three was a major hurricane that was first seen in the Lesser Antilles and travelled north to eventually dissipate over Virginia. It caused 106 deaths in the Bahamas and North Carolina. The last known cyclone was a tropical storm active in October between the Bahamas and the coast of North Carolina. ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1883 till:01/11/1883 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1883 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_(TD)_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:18/08/1883 till:27/08/1883 color:C1 text:\\"One (C1)\\" from:24/08/1883 till:30/08/1883 color:C3 text:\\"Two (C3)\\" from:04/09/1883 till:13/09/1883 color:C3 text:\\"Three (C3)\\" from:22/10/1883 till:24/10/1883 color:TS text:\\"Four (TS)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1883 till:01/09/1883 text:August from:01/09/1883 till:01/10/1883 text:September from:01/10/1883 till:01/11/1883 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" ==SystemsHurricane One=== A tropical storm was first seen on August 18 in the tropical Atlantic. It moved to the west-northwest, becoming a hurricane before turning to the northeast. It moved past Newfoundland on August 26. The hurricane caused 80 deaths from swells in the Newfoundland area. ===Hurricane Two=== A hurricane was first seen on August 24 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Resembling a Cape Verde-type hurricane, it moved to the northwest, and reached major hurricane status on the 28th. On the 29th, the hurricane peaked at , but turned to the northeast where unfavorable conditions caused it to weaken. It passed south of the Canadian Maritimes, and became extratropical on August 30 to the east of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted until September 2 when it lost its identity over East Anglia. ===Hurricane Three=== The Bahamas-North Carolina Hurricane of 1883 A major hurricane moved through the Lesser Antilles on September 4. It crossed Hispaniola, weakening to a minimal hurricane. It restrengthened as it passed the Bahamas, and struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane on the 11th. It dissipated over Virginia on September 13. Across North Carolina trees were uprooted and fences, light buildings, telegraph and telephone lines blown down . Several vessels were wrecked off the North Carolina coast and flooding occurred along the Cape Fear River. In Virginia the rains from this storm helped end a summer-long drought but any benefit was minimal, as the peanut crop had already failed from the lack of rain. At Nottoway, Virginia, heavy rain from the cyclone may have led to a train with 10 freight cars derailing. Overall the hurricane caused 106 deaths in the Bahamas and North Carolina. ===Tropical Storm Four=== A tropical storm formed on October 22 over the Bahamas. It moved to the north, then turned to the northeast while off the North Carolina coastline. The storm peaked at on October 24 before becoming extratropical the same night. As an extratropical cyclone it strengthened to an storm before dissipating. ==See also== *List of notable tropical cyclones *Atlantic hurricane season *Tropical cyclone observation *Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project ==References== ==External links== * 1883 Monthly Weather Review * 1883 AHS at HURDAT * 1883 Hurricane/Tropical Data for Atlantic Atlantic Hurricane Season, 1883 Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:1883 natural disasters ","title":"1883 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"9147934","text":"Berlin Friedrichstra√üe () is a railway station in the German capital Berlin. It is located on the Friedrichstra√üe, a major north-south street in the Mitte district of Berlin, adjacent to the point where the street crosses the river Spree. Underneath the station is the U-Bahn station Friedrichstra√üe. Due to its central location in Berlin and its proximity to attractions such as the Unter den Linden boulevard, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, the station is a favorite destination for tourists. At the same time, it is the main junction for regional traffic in Berlin, measured by the number of passengers. During the Cold War, Friedrichstra√üe became famous for being a station that was located entirely in East Berlin, yet continued to be served by S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains from West Berlin as well as long distance trains from countries west of the Iron Curtain. The station also was a major border crossing between East and West Berlin. == History  The initial station === The first Friedrichstrasse station in 1900; view from the west across the river Spree The train shed of the first station; engraving after the original architectural drawing published in 1885 In 1878, the first station was built after plans by Johannes Vollmer between the Friedrichstra√üe and the river Spree as part of the Berlin Stadtbahn construction. The architect was working on the neighbouring Hackescher Markt station at the same time. Just as the elevated viaduct the station is integrated into, the station rests on large arches built with masonry. The station had two platforms with two tracks each, covered by a large, curved train shed which rested on steel trusses of different length to cover the curvature of the viaduct underneath. The main entrance was on the northern side, the pick-up for horse carriages on the south side. Station opening was on 7 February 1882, as part of the ceremonial opening of the Berlin Stadtbahn. Long distance trains started on 15 May the same year.] === Extensions and remodel === The south side of the remodeled station in 1926 Destruction around the station after World War II Flooded S-Bahn tunnel under the Friedrichstrasse station Because of the large amounts of traffic going through the station even before World War I, plans were made in 1914 to extend the station. There was a new, slightly elevated platform on the northern side for the S-Bahn, and the existing platforms had been made slightly narrower, leaving one platform for the S-Bahn, and two platforms for long distance trains. The steel-truss, double arched train shed was built between 1919 and 1925, featuring large glass fronts. On the northern side of the building, two entry halls in expressionist style were built, and the whole northern side was covered by a characteristic dark tile. The southern facade was only plastered until the last renovation in 1999, when it was also covered by tile. In 1923, the Friedrichstrasse underground station for line C (today's U6 and southeastern U7) was finished, creating the first part of the underground maze the station still has today. At the beginning of the 1930s, construction began again at the Friedrichstrasse station, as the North-South tunnel of the S-Bahn was driven under the station. A long pedestrian tunnel connecting to the underground station of the same name Berlin U-Bahn was also driven under the northern end of the station, and that underground station received the characteristic yellow tile still featured today. On 27 July 1936, just before the 1936 Summer Olympics, the underground S-Bahn station was opened. After the \\"Kristallnacht\\", starting 1 December 1938, thousands of Jewish children started from or passed through the station to leave Germany as part of the Refugee Children Movement. The station was bombed by Polish sabotage and diversionary squad \\"Zagra-lin\\" in early 1943, with 14 people dead and 27 wounded. It escaped major damage during the bombing of Berlin in World War II. U-Bahn and S-Bahn ceased operations on 23 and 25 April 1945, respectively, due to shortage of electricity. During the morning of 2 May 1945, the day Berlin capitulated, a detonation of the North-South tunnel under the Landwehrkanal, caused the flooding of the tunnel, including Friedrichstra√üe's belowground S-Bahn station along with a large part of the Berlin underground system via the connecting tunnel between the S-Bahn and the Berlin U-Bahn at their respective Friedrichstrasse stations.See History of the Berlin U-Bahn#World War II Reconstruction started in 1945. Trains first returned to the facilities above ground. By the end of May and early June 1945 the BVG, the operator of Berlin's U-Bahn, had sealed up the pedestrian tunnel between tunnel S-Bahn and U-Bahn station to stop water flooding into the tunnel. Reichsbahn, the operator of the S-Bahn, had declared that it lacked the means to close the tunnel leaks. On 4 June BVG started the drainage of its underground system. On 12 July the underground reopened its Friedrichstra√üe station for two one-track shuttle operations, one from north and one from south meeting there, regular two-track traffic restarted on since 5 December 1945. Reichsbahn drained its North-South tunnel only later and reopened below-ground S-Bahn service on 2 June 1946. On 1 December the same year North-South tunnel and Friedrichstra√üe below-ground S-Bahn station shut again for an extensive refurbishment which lasted until 16 October 1947, when the North-South tunnel was fully operational again. === Border crossing during the Cold War === Location of Friedrichstra√üe on the U6 and U8 and S1 and S25 active and closed lines and stations in East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War.

Platform B (S-Bahn to the West), November 1989 DDR Passport Control November 1989 During the onset of the Cold War and its tensions between the Western and the Soviet-occupied sectors of Berlin, the Friedrichstrasse station played an important role for citizens of Berlin to reach their friends and relatives in other sectors of Berlin. At the end of 1946, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany had created an East German border police tasked with preventing Republikflucht (escape from the East German republic). With the erection of the Inner German border in 1952, East Germany was to a large degree sealed off from the west. However, Berlin, and in particular the public transport system that criss-crossed between the western Allied and Soviet sectors was still a hole in that Iron Curtain. Accordingly, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West. The 3.5 million East Germans that had left by 1961 totaled approximately 20% of the entire East German population, many using the Friedrichstrasse station with its bustling traffic as the starting point for their escape. During the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany and East Berlin, the Reichsbahn national railway stopped S-Bahn transport between 17 June and 9 July 1953. When the East German government erected the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, it also severed the U-Bahn, S-Bahn and long distance train connections that criss-crossed through Berlin. The district of Berlin Mitte, where the Friedrichstrasse station is located, was surrounded in the northerly, westerly, and southerly directions by Western Sectors: For the S-Bahn at the Friedrichstrasse station, the next station to the west was across the wall in West Berlin, to the north were three more stops in the Soviet sector and only two to the south. The situation was similar for the U6 metro underneath the Friedrichstrasse, which had three stations to the north and two stations to the south before crossing the wall. Therefore, despite their being wholly located in East Berlin, all of the station's underground facilities, namely the S-Bahn platform of the North-South tunnel and the underground station, were only accessible for passengers from the western sectors as a transfer station, or to access the border crossing at the ground level. The facilities above ground, on the arches of the Stadtbahn, were separated along the platforms: * Platform A was used for long distance trains. This included the so-called Interzonenz√ºge, trains running non-stop from Berlin through East German territory to West Germany. For those trains the Friedrichstrasse station was a terminus. This platform was also a stop for trains with international destinations such as Copenhagen, Stockholm (using the ferry connection between Sassnitz and Trelleborg), Z√ºrich, Vienna, and the legendary Paris - Moscow express. The latter could not be boarded by East German passengers at this station; they could only board the train at its next stop Berlin Ostbahnhof. * Platform B became the terminus for the Stadtbahn arriving from West Berlin to and from Wannsee and Staaken. Passengers were able to transfer to the underground lines of the S-Bahn and the U-Bahn, or to long distance trains without entering East Germany. * Platform C in the smaller train shed on the north side was used by traffic going to East Berlin and East Germany, which became now the terminus for the Stadtbahn lines to Erkner, K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, Strausberg Nord, Ahrensfelde, Wartenberg, and to the Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld airport. Between the platforms B and C was a metal-glass barrier that practically fulfilled the same function as the Berlin Wall: East German border troops separated the station into two completely isolated areas, both fully under armed control, one for people within East Berlin and the other for transit travellers, persons switching between the different westbound train lines, and the few Easterners with a hard-to-obtain exit visa, all within one station building with a maze of connecting hallways, barriers, numerous cameras, armed guards with sniffer dogs, plain-clothes agents, and a loggia under the roof for surveillance by armed border patrol and Stasi officers. Tracks between the western and eastern systems were, aside from the long distance tracks, completely separated. S-Bahn trains using the heavily guarded passing track west of platform C required permission from the commander of the border guard detail. An exchange of rolling stock between the divided S-Bahn segments of Berlin was only possible via the long distance tracks on platform A. These tracks were equipped with derailers to prevent escape attempts. At the ground level, between the elevated and the underground part of the station, were the facilities for crossing into East Berlin. This included three individual passport checks, customs control, waiting rooms (since the crossing could take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours), interrogation rooms, holding cells, offices to register and record people crossing the border, and a counter for visa fees and the (mandatory) currency exchange. Due to its location in central Berlin, with its many shops, offices, official buildings, embassies, hotels, as well as cultural and entertainment (Friedrichstadtpalast, Metropol theatre house, opera house, Museum Island), as well as being a border checkpoint, traffic in the station was enormous. In the beginning after the wall had been built, both the eastbound and the westbound border traffic was controlled on ground level. These rather constrained circumstances, compounded by the traffic in and around the station, led to the construction of a building on the square north of the station, which was connected to the main station. This new building was used for westbound border crossings, with separate checkpoints for West Berliners, West Germans, foreigners and diplomats, transit travellers, and the small number of East Germans with exit visas. On the door was a guard station to separate people permitted to cross the border from those ineligible, leading to many tearful goodbyes in front of the building. This gave the building the moniker Tr√§nenpalast (\\"Palace of Tears\\"). On the southern side of the station building was the so-called \\"service entry\\" (Diensteingang) for personnel of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (the East German national railways). This entry led through its own control room and then, via several corridors, to a door on the ground floor of the \\"western\\" side. The entry was used to infiltrate and exfiltrate agents of the East German intelligence service, and to allow members of the West German communist party and West Berlin socialist party to pass without being checked or recorded. This secret pathway between the two cold war fronts was also the escape route for some members of the West German terror organization Red Army Faction to avoid arrest in West Germany. On 7 July 1976 the officially-wanted Movement 2 June members Inge Viett, Monika Berberich, Gabrielle Rollnick, and Juliane Plambeck escaped following their escape from prison, and on 27 May 1978 Till Meyer, escaped into East Germany via Friedrichstrasse station, though they did not stay there. Viett later escaped to East Germany again and stayed there until the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the opposite direction, on 18 January 1979, the East German double agent Werner Stiller used this path to escape to the West. The railway station held another attraction during the Cold War. The ground level and the underground platforms on the \\"western\\" side of the station had so called Intershops, created specifically for travellers from West Berlin who did not want to pass through the East German border controls. Initially just mobile trollies offering alcohol and tobacco, they were soon shops integrated into the station offering food, alcohol, tobacco, books, toys, jewellery, cosmetics, gift items, and more. One could disembark from the U-Bahn, make a purchase, and then get back on the next train and go back to West Berlin, all without going through East German border controls. Purchases could be made with any fully convertible currency, such as U.S. dollars, French francs, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and especially the West German Deutschmark. The merchandise was offered duty-free, which made especially the alcohol and tobacco products particularly attractive to passengers from West Berlin. This was also known to the West Berlin customs agency, which sometimes checked travellers coming from the Friedrichstrasse at their first station in West Berlin. Between 1985 and 1987, a minor renovation of the train shed took place, where the middle wooden roofing section was replaced with glass. The lighting was replaced and the metal parts of the shed were painted. === After the fall of the Berlin Wall to the present === Thousands of East Berliners line up at the station to cross into West Berlin on 10 November 1989, a day after the Fall of the Wall Crowds going through checkpoints inside the Palace of Tears in 1990.

Only S1, S2 and S25 stop at the station The renovated station, with its restored terra cotta clinker bricks as wall covering Platform and train shed on the Berlin Stadtbahn viaduct The Berlin U-Bahn station of the Friedrichstra√üe station Immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the traffic for the S-Bahn in Berlin as well as long distance train traffic to and from Berlin increased dramatically. At first, to immediately ease travel between East- and West-Berlin, the walls and barriers that were built to separate the station were removed. By July 1990, the severed tracks on platform C were reconnected, and after almost 29 years, there was again uninterrupted traffic on the Stadtbahn viaduct line from Berlin Alexanderplatz station to Berlin Zoo station. Very little maintenance had been done to the station during the East German years, and especially the underground section looked like a relic from a different time. Between August 1991 and February 1992, the North-South S-Bahn tunnel including the underground section of the Friedrichstra√üe station were closed for renovation. Because of the damages caused by World War II, and it is incomplete, it was extended to the full closure. The last wartime flood damage was removed in December 1991. Between October 1995 and September 1999, the ground level and the raised level on the Stadtbahn viaduct was completely renovated, costing the Deutsche Bahn a total of 220 Million Deutschmarks. The fa√ßade of the building was covered with terra cotta clinker bricks as the original building had, this time including the southern face of the building. An additional tunnel for traffic to the U-Bahn U6 was driven under the station, and elevators were added between the floors. The ground floor was converted into a shopping area with 50 businesses. Since reopening, regional trains now stop on platform A and B. Beginning in 2002, the North-South S-Bahn tunnel was again renovated, which removed the last traces of East Germany from Friedrichstra√üe station - the green tiles covering the walls. On 30 November 2008, a memorial was unveiled for the 10,000 Jewish children saved by the Refugee Children Movement, and to those deported, that started their journey at this station. Frank Meisler, the sculptor of the memorial, was himself saved by one of the trains bound for London Liverpool Street station (where a similar memorial marks the children's arrival). ==Train services== The station is served by the following service(s): *Regional services Magdeburg ‚Äì Brandenburg ‚Äì Potsdam ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Erkner ‚Äì F√ºrstenwalde ‚Äì Frankfurt (Oder) (‚Äì Cottbus) *Regional services Wismar ‚Äì Schwerin ‚Äì Wittenberge ‚Äì Nauen ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì K√∂nigs Wusterhausen ‚Äì L√ºbben ‚Äì Cottbus *Regional services Dessau ‚Äì Bad Belzig ‚Äì Michendorf ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport ‚Äì W√ºnsdorf-Waldstadt *Local services Nauen ‚Äì Falkensee ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport *Peak hour services Berlin ‚Äì Potsdam ‚Äì Golm ‚Äì Wustermark *Peak hour services Berlin ‚Äì Potsdam ‚Äì Golm ‚Äì Saarmund ‚Äì Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport - K√∂nigs Wusterhausen *Berlin S-Bahn services Oranienburg ‚Äì Wittenau ‚Äì Gesundbrunnen ‚Äì Friedrichstra√üe ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Sch√∂neberg ‚Äì Steglitz ‚Äì Wannsee *Berlin S-Bahn services Bernau ‚Äì Karow ‚Äì Pankow ‚Äì Gesundbrunnen ‚Äì Friedrichstra√üe ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Sudkreuz ‚Äì Blankenfelde *Berlin S-Bahn services Hennigsdorf ‚Äì Tegel ‚Äì Gesundbrunnen ‚Äì Friedrichstra√üe ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Sudkreuz ‚Äì Lichterfelde ‚Äì Teltow *Berlin S-Bahn services Waidmannslust - Wittenau - Gesundbrunnen - Friedrichstra√üe - Potsdamer Platz - Sudkreuz - Lichterfelde - Teltow *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau ‚Äì Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Karlshorst ‚Äì K√∂penick ‚Äì Erkner *Berlin S-Bahn services Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Lichtenberg ‚Äì Strausberg Nord *Berlin S-Bahn services Potsdam ‚Äì Wannsee ‚Äì Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Lichtenberg ‚Äì Ahrensfelde *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau - Westkreuz - Hauptbahnhof - Alexanderplatz - Ostbahnhof - Sch√∂neweide - Flughafen Sch√∂nefeld S-Bahn and regional trains stop at the upper platforms A - C on the Berlin Stadtbahn viaduct, elevated above city streets. This upper level of the station is enclosed by two train shed halls. The smaller shed on the north side is used for the S-Bahn, the larger on the south for regional trains. Platform D is a station on the North- South tunnel of the S-Bahn, located underground approximately aligned with the eastern bank of the Spree river. The underground station for the U6 line is located at the eastern end of the station, directly under the Friedrichstra√üe. In addition, the south side of the station serves as station and terminus for a number of trams and buses of the Berlin transportation company. ==Shops== Since the remodel in 1999, the station houses numerous shops, boutiques and restaurants, making the station blend in with the neighbouring Friedrichstrasse shopping area. In addition, the station houses a Berlin S-Bahn customer center, and a Deutsche Bahn travel center. On the plaza on the south side of the station is a large Taxi stand, and the station is also connected to the Berlin bus and tram system. The former Tr√§nenpalast was used as a club and stage for various performances, such as readings, concerts, and cabaret until 2006. Since September 2011, the building has become a branch museum of the Bonn-based Haus der Geschichte (House of History) and hosts a permanent exhibition devoted to the history of crossing the inner-German border, with particular emphasis on what it was like to cross between East and West Berlin. == In popular culture == There are numerous movies that include scenes filmed at the Friedrichstrasse station: * In the Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne escapes the police by leaping off the bridge in front of the station onto a boat below. * In The Keys to the House, the windows of the father and son's hotel room face the station at platform level. * The movie The Legend of Rita has numerous scenes where the Red Army Faction terrorists use the station to escape to East Berlin. In addition, the East German spy Werner Stiller describes his escape through the station in his memoirs Beyond the Wall. In Mr Norris Changes Trains, novelist Christopher Isherwood has William Bradshaw eating ham and eggs with Arthur Norris at the first class restaurant of the station. In Call of Duty: World at War, the station is used as a means of escape for the Red Army during the Battle of Berlin. In the novel No Man's Land by Michael Califra, the story's narrator, a U.S. expatriate named Richard who lives in West Berlin, is detained in the station after spending the night with his East German girlfriend, Traudi Franzke. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Technische Universit√§t Berlin Architekturmuseum, architectural plans * bildindex der Kunst und Architektur (the train shed under construction 1881) * bildindex der Kunst und Architektur (Friedrichstra√üe station prior to the extension 1914-25) * Station information (S-Bahn) * The Berlin S-Bahn at The Locomotive & Carriage Institution Category:Railway stations in Berlin Category:Berlin S-Bahn stations Category:Berlin U-Bahn stations Category:Buildings and structures in Mitte Category:Berlin border crossings Berlin Friedrichstrasse Berlin Friedrichstrasse ","title":"Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station"},{"id":"9147953","text":"Molavi Ahmad Narouie (1963 ‚Äî 18 March 2014; in Persian: ŸÖŸàŸÑŸà€å ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÜÿßÿ±Ÿà€å€å) was a notable Iranian Sunni theologian, human rights activist, journalist and a vice president of Zahedan seminary.

The 88th U.S. Congressional session passed the S. 2265 bill which the 36th President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson enacted into law on February 11, 1964. ==History== Since public libraries depended on local taxes, sometimes there would be a struggle for funding, especially in rural areas. After the Great Depression in 1929 and the creation of the Works Progress Administration in 1935, part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the American Library Association (ALA) realized federal funding was the best solution. In 1956, the ALA was finally able to persuade Congress to pass the Library Services Act, which provided funds for public library initiatives but did not extend to buildings or land. ==Aim== Influenced by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, a primary aim of the Library Services and Construction Act was to provide funding for underserved and/or disadvantaged communities in need of library service. Some of these groups include but are not limited to the institutionalized, the physically handicapped, low-income families, senior citizens, and ethnic minorities.Bruce E. Daniels. \\"In Defense of LSCA. (Library Services and Construction Act)\\". American Libraries v20.n8 (Sept 1989): pp741(3). ==Reauthorizations== In its thirty-year history, the Library Services and Construction Act has undergone numerous reauthorizations. Each amendment has been dictated by changing needs in the library community, and these needs have been identified and voiced by state librarians and public library directors alike. Some of these amendments include appropriations for literacy programs and the acquisition of foreign-language materials. While changes to the Library Services and Construction Act have sought to keep this piece of legislation current, through the years many have voiced opposition to certain aspects of this act. ==Modifications== Federally funded, many programs for the purpose of educational and social development have more traditionally been a fiscal responsibility of each individual state. Though with shrinking state budgets, a shift to a state-funded program for library services and construction seemed somewhat unfeasible. Additionally, a re-examination of which library services should be preserved and which should be abandoned has been suggested.Edward G. Holley. \\"Is it time to rethink federal library legislation? (Library Services and Construction Act)\\". American Libraries v20.n6 (June 1989): pp525(3). Perhaps as a result of this opposition, in 1995 the LSCA was replaced by the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), dropping construction from the federal funding available. ==Funded programs== Its change of title in 1995 notwithstanding, numerous library programs and services have been initiated by funds through the Library Services and Construction Act, and continue to depend on those funds for their existence. An example of one program funded through the LSCA is Project PLUS (Promoting Larger Units of Service). This program uses federal funding so that library systems can demonstrate the services of a library to a group of unserved residents, so that they may experience what services and resources would be available to them if a referendum was passed in their community and a library was established.Sarah Rohrer. \\"LSCA: A History of Innovation and Cooperation in Illinois Library Services\\". Illinois Libraries v80.n3 (Summer 1998): pp.177-179. While programs such as Project PLUS have provided success stories from the funds provided by the LSCA, discussion will undoubtedly continue as to the legitimacy and necessity of federal funds for libraries throughout the country. ==References== Category:1964 in law Category:88th United States Congress Category:Library law Category:United States federal legislation Category:American librarianship and human rights ","title":"Library Services and Construction Act"},{"id":"9147965","text":"Fernand, Count van de Werve, (9 June 1876 - 29 December 1958) was a Belgian nobleman. == Family == He was the son of L√©on van de Werve (1851-1920) and Ir√®ne Kervyn d'Oud Mooreghem (1857-1938).

Born in Ridgeway, Derbyshire, Pearson joined Manchester United as a trainee in 1955 and signed professional forms two years later. He made his first-team debut as an 18-year-old on 19 February 1958 as part of the makeshift side that beat Sheffield Wednesday in United's first game after the Munich Air Crash. He was involved in two of the three goals, and The Times' correspondent was impressed: Pearson, nicknamed \\"Pancho\\" due to the Mexican appearance that his sideburns gave him, played for the club until 1963, making 80 appearances and scoring 14 goals, when he was sold to Sheffield Wednesday for a ¬£17,000 fee. He did not make United's side for the 1963 FA Cup Final, where they defeated Leicester City 3-1 to clinch their first major trophy of the post-Munich era. Despite his regular action for United in the immediate aftermath of the Munich crash, and the deaths of Tommy Taylor and Liam Whelan, Pearson was soon faced with competition for a regular place in the team when crash survivors Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet regained fitness, and gained a fresh rival that summer when United signed Albert Quixall. Over the next few years, competition for places became tighter due to the arrival of new signings David Herd and Denis Law, as well as the form of younger players including Johnny Giles. In 1965, after two season at Hillsborough, Pearson joined Fulham and played a pivotal role in the club's escape from relegation in the 1965‚Äì66 season. Fulham seemed doomed until a 2‚Äì0 win against Liverpool, runaway league leaders and eventual champions, in which Ian St John was sent off for punching Pearson, sparked them into a sequence of 10 wins from their last 13 matches. He left Fulham for Halifax Town in 1968, playing just five league games before retiring the following year at the age of 29. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:People from North East Derbyshire District Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Halifax Town A.F.C. players Category:Bacup Borough F.C. players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Mark Pearson (footballer)"},{"id":"9148096","text":"Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden also known as Sakkarbaug Zoo or Junagadh Zoo is an zoo that opened in 1863 at Junagadh, Gujarat, India. The zoo provides purebred Asiatic lions for the Indian and the international endangered species captive breeding program for the critically endangered species. Wild free ranging Asiatic lions have become extinct over most of Asia and are today found only in the nearby Gir Forest. ==History== The Sakkarbaug Zoo was established in 1863 by The Mohabat khanji Babi-II of Junagadh state. It is second oldest zoo of India and fourth biggest zoo in India. In 2003 the zoo opened a natural history museum in a large hall in the veterinary hospital. The museum opened with the skeletons of two Asiatic lions, as well as panther, deer, wild boar, antelope, black buck, blue bull, and spotted deer. Eggs, beaks, and feathers of various birds were also on display. The museum will be expanded as specimens become available. In 2008 the Sakkarbaug Zoo Management Advisory Society (initially with 10 members) was formed to develop and manage the zoo and its finances. In 2009, Sakkarbaug Zoo became the only zoo in India to hold African cheetahs when it traded three of its lions with a Singapore zoo for two pairs of cheetahs. The last cheetah at the zoo had died over 60 years ago in 1946. In 2011 the zoo received Indian gaur, Malabar giant squirrels, marmosets and green pheasants from Mysore Zoo in exchange for a pair of Asian lions. At this time, the zoo claimed to have 40 lions and lionesses in their genetic pool. The zoo has been criticized for the size of some of its enclosures, but claims that it is in the process of upgrading them to meet the standards of the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA), and hopes to be done by 2013. ==Animals== In 2008 the zoo was home to 525 mammals (30 per cent of which are under Schedule-I of the Wildlife Act), 597 birds (10 per cent of which are under Schedule-I), and 111 reptiles, housed in 100 enclosures. ==Conservation== In 1998 the Central Zoo Authority of India expanded the captive breeding program for Asiatic lions to include 10 other zoos. The program is jointly managed by the CZA and the Sakkarbaug Zoo, which is the largest breeding center, with nearly 150 lions having been bred by 2008. The zoo is part of the breeding program for white-backed vultures. The first chick from this effort were born at the zoo's Vulture Conservation and Breeding Centre in February 2011. ==See also== * Arid Forest Research Institute ==Notes== ==External links== * Official website of: \\"Central Zoo Authority of India\\" (CZA), Government of India Category:Zoos in India Category:Tourist attractions in Junagadh district Category:Junagadh Category:Protected areas of Gujarat Category:1863 establishments in India Category:Zoos established in 1863 ","title":"Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden"},{"id":"9148104","text":"John Robertson (March 12, 1934 - January 25, 2014) was a Canadian author, writer, journalist and media personality.

When the Roughriders were close to bankruptcy during a tragic 1979 season, Robertson flew in from Winnipeg (where he now worked for CBC Television) at his own expense to help out coach Ronnie Lancaster. The two men were flown around Saskatchewan in a small plane to drum up ticket sales for the final game of the 1979 season. Taylor Field was full to capacity for that game and the efforts of Lancaster and Robertson managed to save the football team from certain extinction. Around the same time in November 1979, in his regular back page column for Maclean's magazine, Robertson coined the term \\"Rider Pride\\" when he wrote about his experiences and his feeling that the Roughriders had the best fans in the CFL. Robertson never received a cent from the Saskatchewan Roughriders franchise for his efforts nor an acknowledgement by the Roughriders franchise for coining the term \\"Rider Pride,\\" a term used extensively by the Saskatchewan Roughriders CFL franchise in their team marketing and for multimillion-dollar annual sales of Roughrider merchandise. Robertson, an avid marathon runner, was the founder of the Manitoba Marathon in 1979, a charity to provide housing for Manitoba's mentally handicapped. He was also involved in charitable causes for the Winnipeg Harvest Food Bank, Gimli Food Bank and the Toronto Food Bank. Robertson was a 24Hours interviewer on CBC-Television CBWT in Winnipeg, September 1977 to September 1981. In 1981, he created a feature documentary on Terry Fox for 24Hours. He also wrote a twice-weekly sports column for the Winnipeg Free Press in 1978, and was considered at the time one of Canada's best sports writers. He resigned from 24Hours to run as a Progressive Conservative in the provincial riding of St. Vital in the 1981 election. After not winning that seat he joined the Winnipeg Sun where he wrote a regular sports column. Robertson wrote four books: High Times with Stewart MacPherson (); Those Amazing Jays (); \\"OK OK Blue Jays\\" and \\"Rusty Staub of the Expos\\" () (). From 1982 to 1989, Robertson worked at the Toronto Sun as a sports columnist then at the Toronto Star where he covered the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team during their road games into the U.S.; he also wrote a regular column producing huge bags of fan letters to the Star. In 1990, after some health complications, Robertson retired to Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba. John Robertson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and died on January 25, 2014 (Scottish poet Robbie Burns' birthday) in Gimli, Manitoba.

It was released in edited form in March 1982 as the third single from their 1981 album Tin Drum. It reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in April. Although it was their biggest hit, this was not enough to stop the band splitting eight months later. Journalist Todd Hutlock called it \\"one of the most remarkable and unlikely entries in British chart history.\\" == Composition == Writing credits for the song are attributed exclusively to David Sylvian, while instruments credits on the single sleeve are attributed to Sylvian, Richard Barbieri and Steve Jansen, therefore excluding the fourth band member, bass guitarist Mick Karn. The lyrics describe deeply personal feelings.

A week later it had shot up to number 16.Popscene TOTP Episode guide - 1982 == Reception == Bereft of drums, the minimalist track would not be described as a \\"commercially viable\\" single in most circumstances. However, Japan's popularity at the time, in addition to the early 1980s fashion for new wave music, allowed the single to become unexpectedly popular. Writing in Smash Hits, Tim de Lisle described the single as \\"arguably the best thing they've ever done ‚Äì slow, spare and mesmerising\\". Record Mirror made it Single of the Week, with reviewer Runie describing it as \\"the most stunningly original single you've heard for a long time\\". == Versions == The 7\\" single was an edited version of the original album track. The single version is featured on a bonus disc issued with the box set release of the Tin Drum album in 2003. A live version of \\"Ghosts\\" is included on the band's live album Oil on Canvas (recorded in 1982). Japan also performed the song live on The Old Grey Whistle Test on 4 March 1982. The band line-up included Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Rhodes and this new version of Ghosts, allegedly arranged by Sakamoto, remains unique to this performance. In 2000 David Sylvian re-recorded \\"Ghosts\\" using the original Japan backing track and included it on his compilation albums Everything and Nothing (2000) and A Victim of Stars 1982‚Äì2012 (2012). Sylvian has said that \\"Ghosts\\" was the first track that indicated the new direction of his compositions after the Japan period. Sylvian also performed the song during The First Day Tour (1992) and Slow Fire Tour (1995). == Legacy == The song appeared on the 2006 DJ mix album \\"Late Night Tales: Air\\". The song was played in episode six in the BBC series of Ashes to Ashes, a spin-off of Life on Mars, and, since April 2008, it has been used in the trailers for another BBC series, Waking the Dead. The song is also featured in the 2008 Norwegian film The Man Who Loved Yngve.

He played for twelve seasons between 1948 and 1959 for the New York Yankees, Washington Senators, Boston Red Sox, Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs. He appeared in one All-Star game in his career. ==New York Yankees== Originally signed by the Yankees in 1946, it did not take him long to reach the Major Leagues. He made his debut on August 8, 1948 at the age of 24. He showed some promise in his rookie season, going 5 and 3 with a 4.50 ERA in 78 innings of work. Although he walked 34 and struck out only 30 batters, he threw only one wild pitch in that time so his control must not have been too much of a concern. While in the minors in 1948, he led the International League in ERA. He spent the next couple years with the Yankees, never playing a full season with them. In his time with them, he wore the number 18, except in 1951, he wore 23. ==Washington Senators== On June 15, 1951, he was sent with Tom Ferrick and Fred Sanford to the Senators for Bob Kuzava. The Senators would end up getting the better of the deal. In less than three seasons with the Yankees, Kuzava would go 15 and 19 as a starter/reliever. In contrast, Ferrick went 6 and 3 with a 2.73 ERA in 49 relief appearances with the Senators. Although Stanford did not amount to much, Bob Porterfield was the gem of the trade. In 1952, he posted a mediocre 13 and 14 record, but he did post solid 2.72 ERA, which was good for seventh in the league. In 1953, he led the league with 22 wins and was tenth in the league with a 3.35 ERA. He was seventh in the league in MVP voting and was named The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year. He led the league with 24 complete games and 9 shutouts and was also involved in a triple play on May 22. He threw two one-hitters in 1953. Oddly, this season was not his lone All- Star season. In fact, 1954 was. He posted a mediocre 13 and 15 record, leading the league in hits allowed with 249. He did lead the league in complete games with 21, but obviously 1953 was far more All-Star worthy than 1954. In his appearance in the All-Star Game, he allowed one home run to Ted Kluszewski. After his three successful seasons in which he averaged a record of 15 and 13, and posted a cumulative 3.14 ERA, his career quickly spiraled downward. His 10 and 17 record and 4.45 in 1955 prompted the Senators to trade him (along with Johnny Schmitz, Tom Umphlett, and Mickey Vernon) to the Red Sox for Karl Olson, Dick Brodowski, Tex Clevenger, Neil Chrisley, and Al Curtis (a minor leaguer) on November 8 of that year. While with the Senators, he wore the number 19, except in 1951, where he wore 29. ==Boston Red Sox== His statistics did not improve while with the Red Sox. In fact, in just over two years with the Red Sox, he posted a 7 and 16 record with an ERA of 4.65. After pitching only two games with the Red Sox in the 1958 season, the Pirates purchased him. In his time with the Red Sox, he wore number 19, except in 1956, where he wore 16 and 20. ==Pittsburgh Pirates== He actually did fairly well with the Pirates in 1958‚Äîin 37 appearances (only six starts), he posted a less-than-stellar 4 and 6 record, but his ERA was a solid 3.29. He surrendered only 78 hits in 87 innings with the Bucs. He won quite a pitching duel with Curt Simmons, earning the victory in a 1‚Äì0, 11 inning bout with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was involved in another interesting game in 1958 as well‚Äîon July 23, \\"Dodger Norm Larker hits a ball just inside the 1B line, which the Pirates believe to be foul. When umpire Vic Delmore signals it fair, P Bob Porterfield picks up the ball from where it had rolled into the bullpen. Though not playing, Porterfield is ejected for intentional interference with a ball in play. Larker is safe on 2B. The Dodgers still lose 11‚Äì3 in the doubleheader opener and are now in last place.\\" 1959 was an interesting year for Porterfield. He started off the season with the Pirates, pitching six games with them, posting a small ERA of 1.69. Nevertheless, the Pirates released him, and the Cubs picked him up. With them, he pitched four games, posting an 11.37 in that time. He was then selected off waivers from the Cubs by the Pirates, the team he started the season with. This go-around with the Bucs was not so successful. In 30 relief appearances, he posted a 4.75 ERA. He played his final game on September 9, 1959. The final batter he faced was Lee Maye. He was released two days after the 1959 season ended. In his time with the Pirates, he wore 16 again. With the Cubs, he wore 43. Overall, he posted an 87 and 97 career record with a 3.79 ERA and 1,567 innings of work. He was obviously not a strikeout pitcher-he posted just 572 Ks in his career (that is only about 3.3 per nine innings of work). ==Career stats== He posted a .184 career batting average, although he did have two very successful seasons. In 98 at-bats in 1953, for example, he posted a .255 average with three home runs and sixteen RBI. His first career home run was a grand slam, which he hit on May 5 of that year. In 1956, he hit .326 in 43 at-bats. Overall, he hit six home runs in his career, driving in 43 runs. He stole one base in one chance. In the field, he committed 15 errors for a .960 fielding percentage. He was also involved in 15 double plays in his career. ==Later life== After his career ended, he became a welder for the Westinghouse Corporation. In 1966, he received one vote for induction into the baseball Hall of Fame-obviously not enough to get him in. He died in 1980 in Charlotte, North Carolina, from lymphoma, at the age of 56. He is buried in Sharon Memorial Park in Charlotte. In 2005, Porterfield was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual shutout leaders * Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award ==References== ==External links== *Baseball Library *Baseball Almanac *The Deadball Era *Retrosheet * Category:1923 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Yankees players Category:Washington Senators (1901‚Äì1960) players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Baseball players from Virginia Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League wins champions Category:Deaths from lymphoma Category:Deaths from cancer in North Carolina Category:People from Giles County, Virginia ","title":"Bob Porterfield"},{"id":"9148253","text":"The Electro Tic-Tac-Toe game by Waco, 1972 Waco was a Japanese toy manufacturer.

When he was still a child, the family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he discovered his talent for art. He studied at the Minneapolis School of Arts (now known as the Minneapolis College of Art and Design). He worked as a Works Progress Administration artist for the Federal Art Project and taught art at the Harlem Community Art Center in New York City, where he was a noted contemporary, friend and partner of another famous African-American artist, Charles Alston, with whom he ran the Alston-Bannarn Harlem Art Workshop in Harlem/NYC, NY. He was intimately associated with the \\"Harlem Renaissance\\" of the 1930s, being considered as one of the movement's preeminent contributors. Although he is primarily known for his work in sculpture, he was equally skilled as a figurist and character artist in the various paint mediums, Cont√© crayon, pastel, free-form sketch, etc. In 1941, he returned to Minnesota and entered a piece of sculpture in the Minnesota State Fair sculpture competition, where he was awarded the first prize.

In this article, several approaches are discussed, although the equations are in terms of electric and magnetic fields, potentials, and charges with currents, generally speaking. ==Vector field approach== The most common description of the electromagnetic field uses two three-dimensional vector fields called the electric field and the magnetic field. These vector fields each have a value defined at every point of space and time and are thus often regarded as functions of the space and time coordinates. As such, they are often written as (electric field) and (magnetic field). If only the electric field (E) is non-zero, and is constant in time, the field is said to be an electrostatic field. Similarly, if only the magnetic field (B) is non-zero and is constant in time, the field is said to be a magnetostatic field. However, if either the electric or magnetic field has a time-dependence, then both fields must be considered together as a coupled electromagnetic field using Maxwell's equations. ===Maxwell's equations in the vector field approach=== The behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, whether in cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, or electrodynamics (electromagnetic fields), is governed by Maxwell's equations: :{ class=\\"toccolours collapsible\\" width=\\"400px\\" ECFCF4; padding:6; cellpadding=6;text-align:left;border:2px solid #50C878\\" - text-align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Maxwell's equations (vector fields) -  abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_0}  Gauss's law -  abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B} = 0  Gauss's law for magnetism -  abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} = -\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B}}{\\\\partial t}  Faraday's law -  abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf{J} + \\\\mu_0\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{E}}{\\\\partial t}  Amp√®re‚ÄìMaxwell law } where œÅ is the charge density, which can (and often does) depend on time and position, Œµ0 is the electric constant, Œº0 is the magnetic constant, and J is the current per unit area, also a function of time and position. The equations take this form with the International System of Quantities. When dealing with only nondispersive isotropic linear materials, Maxwell's equations are often modified to ignore bound charges by replacing the permeability and permittivity of free space with the permeability and permittivity of the linear material in question. For some materials that have more complex responses to electromagnetic fields, these properties can be represented by tensors, with time-dependence related to the material's ability to respond to rapid field changes (dispersion (optics), Green‚ÄìKubo relations), and possibly also field dependencies representing nonlinear and/or nonlocal material responses to large amplitude fields (nonlinear optics). ==Potential field approach== Many times in the use and calculation of electric and magnetic fields, the approach used first computes an associated potential: the electric potential, \\\\varphi, for the electric field, and the magnetic vector potential, A, for the magnetic field. The electric potential is a scalar field, while the magnetic potential is a vector field. This is why sometimes the electric potential is called the scalar potential and the magnetic potential is called the vector potential. These potentials can be used to find their associated fields as follows: :\\\\mathbf E = - \\\\mathbf abla \\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf A}{\\\\partial t} :\\\\mathbf B = \\\\mathbf abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf A ===Maxwell's equations in potential formulation=== These relations can be substituted into Maxwell's equations to express the latter in terms of the potentials. Faraday's law and Gauss's law for magnetism reduce to identities (e.g., in the case of Gauss's Law for magnetism, ). The other two of Maxwell's equations turn out less simply. These equations taken together are as powerful and complete as Maxwell's equations. Moreover, the problem has been reduced somewhat, as the electric and magnetic fields together had six components to solve for.Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths In the potential formulation, there are only four components: the electric potential and the three components of the vector potential. However, the equations are messier than Maxwell's equations using the electric and magnetic fields. ===Gauge freedom=== These equations can be simplified by taking advantage of the fact that the electric and magnetic fields are physically meaningful quantities that can be measured; the potentials are not. There is a freedom to constrain the form of the potentials provided that this does not affect the resultant electric and magnetic fields, called gauge freedom. Specifically for these equations, for any choice of a twice-differentiable scalar function of position and time Œª, if is a solution for a given system, then so is another potential given by: :\\\\varphi' = \\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}{\\\\partial t} :\\\\mathbf A' = \\\\mathbf A + \\\\mathbf abla \\\\lambda This freedom can be used to simplify the potential formulation. Either of two such scalar functions is typically chosen: the Coulomb gauge and the Lorenz gauge. Coulomb gauge The Coulomb gauge is chosen in such a way that \\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf A' = 0, which corresponds to the case of magnetostatics. In terms of Œª, this means that it must satisfy the equation : abla^2 \\\\lambda = - \\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf A. This choice of function results in the following formulation of Maxwell's equations: : abla^2 \\\\varphi' = -\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_0} : abla^2 \\\\mathbf A' - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\\\\\! \\\\mathbf A'}{\\\\partial t^2} = - \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf J + \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 abla\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\left (\\\\\\\\! \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi'}{\\\\partial t} \\\\\\\\!\\\\right ) Several features about Maxwell's equations in the Coulomb gauge are as follows. Firstly, solving for the electric potential is very easy, as the equation is a version of Poisson's equation. Secondly, solving for the magnetic vector potential is particularly difficult. This is the big disadvantage of this gauge. The third thing to note, and something which is not immediately obvious, is that the electric potential changes instantly everywhere in response to a change in conditions in one locality. For instance, if a charge is moved in New York at 1 pm local time, then a hypothetical observer in Australia who could measure the electric potential directly would measure a change in the potential at 1 pm New York time. This seemingly violates causality in special relativity, i.e. the impossibility of information, signals, or anything travelling faster than the speed of light. The resolution to this apparent problem lies in the fact that, as previously stated, no observers can measure the potentials; they measure the electric and magnetic fields. So, the combination of ‚àáœÜ and ‚àÇA/‚àÇt used in determining the electric field restores the speed limit imposed by special relativity for the electric field, making all observable quantities consistent with relativity. Lorenz gauge condition A gauge that is often used is the Lorenz gauge condition. In this, the scalar function Œª is chosen such that :\\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf A' = - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi'}{\\\\partial t} , meaning that Œª must satisfy the equation : abla^2 \\\\lambda - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\lambda }{\\\\partial t^2}= - \\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf A - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t} . The Lorenz gauge results in the following form of Maxwell's equations: : abla^2 \\\\varphi' - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi'}{\\\\partial t^2} = -\\\\Box^2 \\\\varphi' = - \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_0} : abla^2 \\\\mathbf A' - \\\\mu_0 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf A'}{\\\\partial t^2} = -\\\\Box^2 \\\\mathbf A' = - \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf J The operator \\\\Box^2 is called the d'Alembertian (some authors denote this by only the square \\\\Box). These equations are inhomogeneous versions of the wave equation, with the terms on the right side of the equation serving as the source functions for the wave. As with any wave equation, these equations lead to two types of solution: advanced potentials (which are related to the configuration of the sources at future points in time), and retarded potentials (which are related to the past configurations of the sources); the former are usually disregarded where the field is to analyzed from a causality perspective. As pointed out above, the Lorenz gauge is no more valid than any other gauge since the potentials cannot be measured. Despite this, there are certain quantum mechanical phenomena in which potentials appear to affect particles in regions where the observable field vanishes throughout the region, for example as in the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect. However, these phenomena do not provide a means to directly measure the potentials nor to detect a difference between different but mutually gauge equivalent potentials. The Lorenz gauge has the further advantage of the equations being Lorentz invariant. ===Extension to quantum electrodynamics=== Canonical quantization of the electromagnetic fields proceeds by elevating the scalar and vector potentials; œÜ(x), A(x), from fields to field operators. Substituting into the previous Lorenz gauge equations gives: : abla^2 \\\\mathbf A - \\\\frac 1 {c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\mathbf A}{\\\\partial t^2} = - \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf J : abla^2 \\\\varphi - \\\\frac 1 {c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t^2} = - \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\varepsilon_0} Here, J and œÅ are the current and charge density of the matter field. If the matter field is taken so as to describe the interaction of electromagnetic fields with the Dirac electron given by the four-component Dirac spinor field œà, the current and charge densities have form:Quantum Electrodynamics, Mathworld :\\\\mathbf{J}=-e\\\\psi^{\\\\dagger}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\psi\\\\,\\\\quad \\\\rho=-e\\\\psi^{\\\\dagger}\\\\psi \\\\,, where Œ± are the first three Dirac matrices. Using this, we can re-write Maxwell's equations as: which is the form used in quantum electrodynamics. ==Geometric algebra formulations== Analogous to the tensor formulation, two objects, one for the field and one for the current, are introduced. In geometric algebra (GA) these are multivectors. The field multivector, known as the Riemann‚ÄìSilberstein vector, is : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{E} + Ic\\\\mathbf{B} = E^k\\\\sigma_k + IcB^k\\\\sigma_k and the current multivector is : c \\\\rho - \\\\mathbf{J} = c \\\\rho - J^k\\\\sigma_k where, in the algebra of physical space (APS) C\\\\ell_{3,0}(\\\\mathbb{R}) with the vector basis \\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma_k\\\\\\\\}. The unit pseudoscalar is I=\\\\sigma_1\\\\sigma_2\\\\sigma_3 (assuming an orthonormal basis). Orthonormal basis vectors share the algebra of the Pauli matrices, but are usually not equated with them. After defining the derivative : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} = \\\\sigma^k \\\\partial_k Maxwell's equations are reduced to the single equationOersted Medal Lecture David Hestenes \\"Reforming the Mathematical Language of Physics\\" (Am. J. Phys. 71 (2), February 2003, pp. 104‚Äì121) Online:http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/Oersted- ReformingTheLanguage.html p26 In three dimensions, the derivative has a special structure allowing the introduction of a cross product: : \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} + I \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} from which it is easily seen that Gauss's law is the scalar part, the Amp√®re‚ÄìMaxwell law is the vector part, Faraday's law is the pseudovector part, and Gauss's law for magnetism is the pseudoscalar part of the equation. After expanding and rearranging, this can be written as : \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} - \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\epsilon_0} \\\\right)- c \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} - \\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial {\\\\mathbf{E}}}{\\\\partial {t}} - \\\\mu_0 \\\\mathbf{J} \\\\right)+ I \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial {\\\\mathbf{B}}}{\\\\partial {t}} \\\\right)+ I c \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\right)= 0 We can identify APS as a subalgebra of the spacetime algebra (STA) C\\\\ell_{1,3}(\\\\mathbb{R}), defining \\\\sigma_k=\\\\gamma_k\\\\gamma_0 and I=\\\\gamma_0\\\\gamma_1\\\\gamma_2\\\\gamma_3. The \\\\gamma_\\\\mus have the same algebraic properties of the gamma matrices but their matrix representation is not needed. The derivative is now : abla = \\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu. The Riemann‚ÄìSilberstein becomes a bivector F = \\\\mathbf{E} + Ic\\\\mathbf{B} = E^1\\\\gamma_1\\\\gamma_0 + E^2\\\\gamma_2\\\\gamma_0 + E^3\\\\gamma_3\\\\gamma_0 -c(B^1\\\\gamma_2\\\\gamma_3 + B^2\\\\gamma_3\\\\gamma_1 + B^3\\\\gamma_1\\\\gamma_2), and the charge and current density become a vector :J = J^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_\\\\mu = c \\\\rho \\\\gamma_0 + J^k \\\\gamma_k = \\\\gamma_0(c \\\\rho - J^k \\\\sigma_k). Owing to the identity :\\\\gamma_0 abla = \\\\gamma_0\\\\gamma^0 \\\\partial_0 + \\\\gamma_0\\\\gamma^k\\\\partial_k = \\\\partial_0 + \\\\sigma^k\\\\partial_k = \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\dfrac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t} + \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}, Maxwell's equations reduce to the single equation ==Differential forms approachField 2-form=== In free space, where and are constant everywhere, Maxwell's equations simplify considerably once the language of differential geometry and differential forms is used. In what follows, cgs-Gaussian units, not SI units are used. (To convert to SI, see here.) The electric and magnetic fields are now jointly described by a 2-form F in a 4-dimensional spacetime manifold. The Faraday tensor F_{\\\\mu u} (electromagnetic tensor) can be written as a 2-form in Minkowski space with metric signature as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{F} & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{2}F_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\mu} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{ u} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = B_x \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z + B_y \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x + B_z \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y + E_x \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t + E_y \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t + E_z \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\end{align} which, as the curvature form, is the exterior derivative of the electromagnetic four-potential, : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mathbf{A} = ( \\\\partial_{\\\\mu} A_{ u} ) \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\mu} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{ u} The source free equations can be written by the action of the exterior derivative on this 2-form. But for the equations with source terms (Gauss's law and the Amp√®re- Maxwell equation), the Hodge dual of this 2-form is needed. The Hodge star operator takes a p-form to a ()-form, where n is the number of dimensions. Here, it takes the 2-form (F) and gives another 2-form (in four dimensions, ). For the basis cotangent vectors, the Hodge dual is given as (see ) : {\\\\star} ( \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y ) = - \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t ,\\\\quad {\\\\star} ( \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t ) = \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z, and so on. Using these relations, the dual of the Faraday 2-form is the Maxwell tensor, : {\\\\star} \\\\mathbf{F} = - B_x \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t - B_y \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t - B_z \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}t + E_x \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z + E_y \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x + E_z \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y ===Current 3-form, dual current 1-form=== Here, the 3-form J is called the electric current form or current 3-form: : \\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z - j_x \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z - j_y \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x - j_z \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y with the corresponding dual 1-form: : {{\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{J}} = -\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t + j_x \\\\mathrm{d}x + j_y \\\\mathrm{d}y + j_z \\\\mathrm{d}z Maxwell's equations then reduce to the Bianchi identity and the source equation, respectively:Harley Flanders (1963) Differential Forms with Applications to Physical Sciences, pages 44 to 46, Academic Press where d denotes the exterior derivative ‚Äì a natural coordinate- and metric-independent differential operator acting on forms, and the (dual) Hodge star operator {\\\\star} is a linear transformation from the space of 2-forms to the space of (4 ‚àí 2)-forms defined by the metric in Minkowski space (in four dimensions even by any metric conformal to this metric). The fields are in natural units where . Since d2 = 0, the 3-form J satisfies the conservation of current (continuity equation): :\\\\mathrm{d}{\\\\mathbf{J}}=\\\\mathrm{d}^2{\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{F}=0. The current 3-form can be integrated over a 3-dimensional space-time region. The physical interpretation of this integral is the charge in that region if it is spacelike, or the amount of charge that flows through a surface in a certain amount of time if that region is a spacelike surface cross a timelike interval. As the exterior derivative is defined on any manifold, the differential form version of the Bianchi identity makes sense for any 4-dimensional manifold, whereas the source equation is defined if the manifold is oriented and has a Lorentz metric. In particular the differential form version of the Maxwell equations are a convenient and intuitive formulation of the Maxwell equations in general relativity. Note: In much of the literature, the notations \\\\mathbf{J} and {\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{J} are switched, so that \\\\mathbf{J} is a 1-form called the current and {\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{J} is a 3-form called the dual current. Linear macroscopic influence of matter In a linear, macroscopic theory, the influence of matter on the electromagnetic field is described through more general linear transformation in the space of 2-forms. We call : C:\\\\Lambda^2 i\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf{G}\\\\in\\\\Lambda^{(4-2)} the constitutive transformation. The role of this transformation is comparable to the Hodge duality transformation. The Maxwell equations in the presence of matter then become: : \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{F} = 0 : \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\mathbf{J} where the current 3-form J still satisfies the continuity equation . When the fields are expressed as linear combinations (of exterior products) of basis forms Œ∏p, : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\frac{1}{2}F_{pq}\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^p\\\\wedge\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^q. the constitutive relation takes the form : G_{pq} = C_{pq}^{mn}F_{mn} where the field coefficient functions are antisymmetric in the indices and the constitutive coefficients are antisymmetric in the corresponding pairs. In particular, the Hodge duality transformation leading to the vacuum equations discussed above are obtained by taking : C_{pq}^{mn} = \\\\frac{1}{2}g^{ma}g^{nb} \\\\epsilon_{abpq} \\\\sqrt{-g} which up to scaling is the only invariant tensor of this type that can be defined with the metric. In this formulation, electromagnetism generalises immediately to any 4-dimensional oriented manifold or with small adaptations any manifold. ===Alternate metric signature=== In the particle physicist's sign convention for the metric signature , the potential 1-form is : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\phi\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t - A_x \\\\mathrm{d}x - A_y \\\\mathrm{d}y - A_z \\\\mathrm{d}z . The Faraday curvature 2-form becomes : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\equiv & \\\\frac{1}{2}F_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\mu} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{ u} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = & E_x \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x + E_y \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y + E_z \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z - B_x \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z - B_y \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x - B_z \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\end{align} and the Maxwell tensor becomes : {{\\\\star} \\\\mathbf{F}} = - E_x \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z - E_y \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x - E_z \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y - B_x \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x - B_y \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y - B_z \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z . The current 3-form J is : \\\\mathbf{J} = - \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z + j_x \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z + j_y \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x + j_z \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y and the corresponding dual 1-form is : {{\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{J}} = -\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t + j_x \\\\mathrm{d}x + j_y \\\\mathrm{d}y + j_z \\\\mathrm{d}z . The current norm is now positive and equals : {\\\\mathbf{J} \\\\wedge {\\\\star}\\\\mathbf{J}} = (\\\\rho^2 + j_x^2 + j_y^2 + j_z^2)\\\\,{\\\\star}(1) , with the canonical volume form {\\\\star}(1) = \\\\mathrm{d}t \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}z. ==Curved spacetimeTraditional formulation=== Matter and energy generate curvature of spacetime. This is the subject of general relativity. Curvature of spacetime affects electrodynamics. An electromagnetic field having energy and momentum also generates curvature in spacetime. Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime can be obtained by replacing the derivatives in the equations in flat spacetime with covariant derivatives. (Whether this is the appropriate generalization requires separate investigation.) The sourced and source-free equations become (cgs-Gaussian units): : { 4 \\\\pi \\\\over c }j^{\\\\beta} = \\\\partial_{\\\\alpha} F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + {\\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}}_{\\\\mu\\\\alpha} F^{\\\\mu\\\\beta} + {\\\\Gamma^{\\\\beta}}_{\\\\mu\\\\alpha} F^{\\\\alpha \\\\mu} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ abla_{\\\\alpha} F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {F^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}_{;\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\\\\\! and :0 = \\\\partial_{\\\\gamma} F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + \\\\partial_{\\\\beta} F_{\\\\gamma\\\\alpha} + \\\\partial_{\\\\alpha} F_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma} = abla_{\\\\gamma} F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + abla_{\\\\beta} F_{\\\\gamma\\\\alpha} + abla_{\\\\alpha} F_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}.\\\\, Here, :{\\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}}_{\\\\mu\\\\beta} \\\\\\\\! is a Christoffel symbol that characterizes the curvature of spacetime and ‚àáŒ± is the covariant derivative. ===Formulation in terms of differential forms=== The formulation of the Maxwell equations in terms of differential forms can be used without change in general relativity. The equivalence of the more traditional general relativistic formulation using the covariant derivative with the differential form formulation can be seen as follows. Choose local coordinates xŒ± which gives a basis of 1-forms dxŒ± in every point of the open set where the coordinates are defined. Using this basis and cgs-Gaussian units we define *The antisymmetric field tensor FŒ±Œ≤, corresponding to the field 2-form F : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\frac{1}{2}F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\alpha} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\beta}. *The current-vector infinitesimal 3-form J : \\\\mathbf{J} = {4 \\\\pi \\\\over c } \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{6} j^{\\\\alpha} \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\, \\\\epsilon_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\delta} \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\beta} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\gamma} \\\\wedge \\\\mathrm{d}x^{\\\\delta}. \\\\right) The epsilon tensor contracted with the differential 3-form produces 6 times the number of terms required. Here g is as usual the determinant of the matrix representing the metric tensor, gŒ±Œ≤.

The principal U(1)-connection ‚àá on the line bundle has a curvature F = ‚àá2 which is a two-form that automatically satisfies and can be interpreted as a field-strength. If the line bundle is trivial with flat reference connection d we can write ‚àá = d + A and with A the 1-form composed of the electric potential and the magnetic vector potential. In quantum mechanics, the connection itself is used to define the dynamics of the system. This formulation allows a natural description of the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect. In this experiment, a static magnetic field runs through a long magnetic wire (e.g., an iron wire magnetized longitudinally). Outside of this wire the magnetic induction is zero, in contrast to the vector potential, which essentially depends on the magnetic flux through the cross-section of the wire and does not vanish outside. Since there is no electric field either, the Maxwell tensor throughout the space-time region outside the tube, during the experiment. This means by definition that the connection ‚àá is flat there. However, as mentioned, the connection depends on the magnetic field through the tube since the holonomy along a non-contractible curve encircling the tube is the magnetic flux through the tube in the proper units. This can be detected quantum-mechanically with a double-slit electron diffraction experiment on an electron wave traveling around the tube. The holonomy corresponds to an extra phase shift, which leads to a shift in the diffraction pattern. ==Discussion== Following are the reasons for using each of such formulations. ===Potential formulation=== In advanced classical mechanics it is often useful, and in quantum mechanics frequently essential, to express Maxwell's equations in a potential formulation involving the electric potential (also called scalar potential) œÜ, and the magnetic potential (a vector potential) A. For example, the analysis of radio antennas makes full use of Maxwell's vector and scalar potentials to separate the variables, a common technique used in formulating the solutions of differential equations. The potentials can be introduced by using the Poincar√© lemma on the homogeneous equations to solve them in a universal way (this assumes that we consider a topologically simple, e.g. contractible space). The potentials are defined as in the table above. Alternatively, these equations define E and B in terms of the electric and magnetic potentials which then satisfy the homogeneous equations for E and B as identities. Substitution gives the non- homogeneous Maxwell equations in potential form. Many different choices of A and œÜ are consistent with given observable electric and magnetic fields E and B, so the potentials seem to contain more, (classically) unobservable information. The non uniqueness of the potentials is well understood, however. For every scalar function of position and time , the potentials can be changed by a gauge transformation as :\\\\varphi' = \\\\varphi - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}{\\\\partial t}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf A' = \\\\mathbf A + \\\\mathbf abla \\\\lambda without changing the electric and magnetic field. Two pairs of gauge transformed potentials and are called gauge equivalent, and the freedom to select any pair of potentials in its gauge equivalence class is called gauge freedom. Again by the Poincar√© lemma (and under its assumptions), gauge freedom is the only source of indeterminacy, so the field formulation is equivalent to the potential formulation if we consider the potential equations as equations for gauge equivalence classes. The potential equations can be simplified using a procedure called gauge fixing. Since the potentials are only defined up to gauge equivalence, we are free to impose additional equations on the potentials, as long as for every pair of potentials there is a gauge equivalent pair that satisfies the additional equations (i.e. if the gauge fixing equations define a slice to the gauge action). The gauge-fixed potentials still have a gauge freedom under all gauge transformations that leave the gauge fixing equations invariant. Inspection of the potential equations suggests two natural choices. In the Coulomb gauge, we impose which is mostly used in the case of magneto statics when we can neglect the c‚àí2‚àÇ2A/‚àÇt2 term. In the Lorenz gauge (named after the Dane Ludvig Lorenz), we impose :\\\\mathbf abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf A + \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t} = 0\\\\,. The Lorenz gauge condition has the advantage of being Lorentz invariant and leading to Lorentz-invariant equations for the potentials. ===Manifestly covariant (tensor) approach=== Maxwell's equations are exactly consistent with special relativity‚Äîi.e., if they are valid in one inertial reference frame, then they are automatically valid in every other inertial reference frame. In fact, Maxwell's equations were crucial in the historical development of special relativity. However, in the usual formulation of Maxwell's equations, their consistency with special relativity is not obvious; it can only be proven by a laborious calculation. For example, consider a conductor moving in the field of a magnet.Albert Einstein (1905) On the electrodynamics of moving bodies In the frame of the magnet, that conductor experiences a magnetic force. But in the frame of a conductor moving relative to the magnet, the conductor experiences a force due to an electric field. The motion is exactly consistent in these two different reference frames, but it mathematically arises in quite different ways. For this reason and others, it is often useful to rewrite Maxwell's equations in a way that is \\"manifestly covariant\\"‚Äîi.e. obviously consistent with special relativity, even with just a glance at the equations‚Äîusing covariant and contravariant four- vectors and tensors. This can be done using the EM tensor F, or the 4-potential A, with the 4-current J ‚Äì see covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism. ===Differential forms approach=== Gauss's law for magnetism and the Faraday‚ÄìMaxwell law can be grouped together since the equations are homogeneous, and be seen as geometric identities expressing the field F (a 2-form), which can be derived from the 4-potential A. Gauss's law for electricity and the Ampere‚ÄìMaxwell law could be seen as the dynamical equations of motion of the fields, obtained via the Lagrangian principle of least action, from the \\"interaction term\\" AJ (introduced through gauge covariant derivatives), coupling the field to matter. For the field formulation of Maxwell's equations in terms of a principle of extremal action, see electromagnetic tensor. Often, the time derivative in the Faraday‚ÄìMaxwell equation motivates calling this equation \\"dynamical\\", which is somewhat misleading in the sense of the preceding analysis. This is rather an artifact of breaking relativistic covariance by choosing a preferred time direction. To have physical degrees of freedom propagated by these field equations, one must include a kinetic term for A, and take into account the non-physical degrees of freedom that can be removed by gauge transformation . See also gauge fixing and Faddeev‚ÄìPopov ghosts. ===Geometric calculus approach=== This formulation uses the algebra that spacetime generates through the introduction of a distributive, associative (but not commutative) product called the geometric product. Elements and operations of the algebra can generally be associated with geometric meaning. The members of the algebra may be decomposed by grade (as in the formalism of differential forms) and the (geometric) product of a vector with a k-vector decomposes into a -vector and a -vector. The -vector component can be identified with the inner product and the -vector component with the outer product. It is of algebraic convenience that the geometric product is invertible, while the inner and outer products are not. The derivatives that appear in Maxwell's equations are vectors and electromagnetic fields are represented by the Faraday bivector F. This formulation is as general as that of differential forms for manifolds with a metric tensor, as then these are naturally identified with r-forms and there are corresponding operations. Maxwell's equations reduce to one equation in this formalism. This equation can be separated into parts as is done above for comparative reasons. ==See also== *Ricci calculus *Electromagnetic wave equation *Speed of light *Electric constant *Magnetic constant *Free space *Near and far field *Electromagnetic field *Electromagnetic radiation *Quantum electrodynamics *List of electromagnetism equations ==Notes== ==References== * * (with worked problems in Warnick, Russer 2006 ) * * Category:Electromagnetism Category:Mathematical physics ","title":"Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field"},{"id":"9148284","text":"Tetbury Upton is a small village and civil parish in the Cotswolds area of Gloucestershire, England.

Along with Max Weber and Robert Michels, he is considered one of the founders of political sociology, especially in the field of theories about party systems and political parties.Lipset (1982) Ostrogorski noted that loyalty to parties is often comparable to loyalty to one's religion. He was a member of the First State Duma of the Russian Empire representing the Hrodna province in 1906-1907. ==Biography== Moisey Ostrogorsky was born in 1854 in the Grodno province of the Russian Empire (now in the Belarus), where he grew up. He studied law at Saint Petersburg State University and worked for the Russian justice ministry. He represented Grodno province in the First State Duma (Parliament of the Russian Empire). In the 1880s, he went to Paris and studied at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, where he wrote his dissertation Les origines du suffrage universel (The origins of universal suffrage) (1885). Whilst in France, Ostrogorski imbibed French political thought, which was distrustful of an all-powerful state, from thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Tocqueville, Saint Simon and Proudhon.(Lipset, S.M. (1960). Political Man. Garden City, New York. p22) He traveled to the United States and Great Britain. In 1902, he published Democracy and the Organization of Political Parties\\"The Party System: Ostrogorski's Work on Democracy and Political Organization,\\" The New York Times, December 27, 1902. (originally in French), which compared the political system of the two nations. After returning to Russia in 1906, he became the Duma representative for the Hrodna province as a member of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party. He left politics after the Duma was dissolved during the Russian Revolution. As a political thinker, he was recognized in the West before he was in Russia. Ostrogorski has been influential on the political thought of the 20th century. After leaving politics, he taught at the Psychoneurological Institute in St. Petersburg. He died on 10 February 1921 in St. Petersburg, now renamed Petrograd. ===Work on political science=== Ostrogorski's main work is La democratie et l'organisation des partis politiques.(Paris, 1903; the English edition, London, 1903; vol, 2 appeared as Democracy and the Party System in the United States, New York, 1910; the new advanced edition of all works under the title La democratie et les partis politiques, \\"Democracy and Political Parties\\", Paris, 1912) He noted behavioural determinism in organisational structure: \\"As soon as a party, even if created for the noblest object perpetuates itself, it tends to degeneration\\", which influenced \\"the later researches of Max Weber, Robert Michels, and Andre Siegfried\\".(Scheider, Theodor. (1962). The State and Society in Modern Times. London, England: Thomas Nelson and Sons, p84.) Ostrogorski is one of the few scholars referenced by Max Weber in his classic lecture \\"Politics as Vocation.\\" Ostrogorski is also the author of a book that is about the equality of the sexes: La Femme au point de vue du droit public.(Paris, 1892, 2 English edition, London, 1908; German translation, Leipzig, 1897, the Polish translation, Warsaw, 1898) ==Legacy== Ostrogorsky unwittingly donated his surname to the Ostrogorski Centre, which is a \\"Western-style\\" political lobby group.

He also wanted to transform Merrill into a trading powerhouse, and to beat Goldman Sachs at its own game. After the departure of Chris Ricciardi, O'Neal hired Osman Semerci on the advice of fixed-income head Dow Kim and chief administrative officer Ahmass Fakahany. Semerci continued the push into the subprime mortgage-backed CDO market, and grew the firm's position from $5-$6 billion worth of exposure to $55 billion in under one year, while firing respected trader Jeff Kronthal and demoting risk manager John Breit, both of whom had warned against too much exposure to CDOs. Merrill was one of the top CDO underwriters of the boom era, a plan that initially brought huge bonuses to Merrill until the markets turned.Crash of the Titans, Greg Farrell, Crown Business, 2010 According to the then-president of Merrill, Greg Fleming, the dismissal of Kronthal in July 2006 was the day Merrill Lynch‚Äôs fate was sealed, otherwise the firm may have \\"avoided the subprime problems that would soon bring Wall Street to its knees. After that date, Merrill was doomed to make the same mistakes as its competitors.\\" O'Neal was regarded as out of touch as the market changed and Merrill steered towards trouble, as he had \\"become isolated from his own firm.

He possessed a ripe-toned voice of great flexibility and displayed tremendous skill at patter singing. Pini-Corsi participated in numerous operatic premieres, creating such roles on stage as Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Schaunard in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me. Part of the first generation of recorded musicians, Pini-Corsi was one of the finest buffo singers of his era. ==Career== Pini-Corsi was born into a musical family in Zara, later known as Zadar, in what is now Croatia. (Many of his relatives sang professionally, most notably his brother Gaetano, who was a successful operatic tenor.) He made his professional opera debut in Cremona in 1878 as Dandini in La Cenerentola. Pini-Corsi subsequently appeared in opera houses throughout Italy for the next 15 years, specializing in the comic operas of Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti. He made his La Scala debut in 1892 as Don Rolando Ximenes in the first performance of the revised version of Alberto Franchetti's Cristoforo Colombo. Pini-Corsi's career was now booming. In 1893, he returned to La Scala to portray the title role in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto opposite Nellie Melba as Gilda. Shortly thereafter he portrayed Ford in the premiere of Verdi's final opera, Falstaff, at La Scala on 9 February 1893 at the behest of the composer, who admired his vocal skill and stage craft. During the course of that same year he also sang the role of Ford in Genoa, Rome, Venice and Brescia. He also made an appearance at the Vienna State Opera. On 14 May 1894 he made his Royal Opera House at Covent Garden debut as Lescaut in Giacomo Puccini's Manon Lescaut. Five days later he returned to the house to sing Ford in the company's first production of Falstaff. He then joined the roster of the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo in 1895, singing there on and off for two years. On 1 February 1896, Pini-Corsi portrayed the role of Schaunard in the original production of Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Regio Torino. He later reprised the role in several productions throughout Italy. He appeared in another new opera, Franchetti's Signor di Pourceaugnac, in both Genoa and Rome in 1898. The following year he made his debut in the United States when, on November 20, 1899, he performed to acclaim at the New York Metropolitan Opera as Bartolo in The Barber of Seville. He sang with the company for the next two years, appearing as Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana, Bartolo in The Marriage of Figaro, Cajus in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Dr. Dulcamara in L'elisir d'amore, Leporello in Don Giovanni, Masetto in Don Giovanni, Monostatos in The Magic Flute, Sacristan in Tosca, and the title role in Don Pasquale. In 1902, Pini-Corsi returned to Italy, where he spent seven years, performing mostly at La Scala. Most notably he took part in the premiere performances of Umberto Giordano's Siberia (1903) and Franchetti's La figlia di Iorio (1906), and appeared in Alfredo Catalani's La Wally (1905) and in Der Freisch√ºtz (1906). He also was a frequent guest artist at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo, appearing in productions with them in 1903, 1907, and 1909. In 1907 he performed at the Berlin State Opera and in 1908 performed in several operas throughout South America including performances at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires. That same year he also made a few appearances at the Vienna State Opera. In 1909 he sang Don Pasquale to Alice Nielsen's Norina with the Boston Opera Company. On November 16, 1909 Pini-Corsi returned to the Met to portray the role of Bailiff in Werther. He remained with the Met until 1914, appearing in numerous world premieres, including those of the Monk in Walter Damrosch's Cyrano, Happy in La fanciulla del West, the Innkeeper in Engelbert Humperdinck's K√∂nigskinder, and Mauprat in Victor Herbert's Madeline. He also appeared in the American premieres of two operas by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, Arnolfo in L'amore medico and Pantalone in Le donne curiose, and that of Crisogono in Franchetti's Germania. His other roles at the Met included Alcindoro, Schaunard and Benoit in La boh√®me, Barnaba in Il maestro di cappella, Don Pasquale, Ford, Geronte in Manon Lescaut, Larivaudi√®re in La fille de Madame Angot, the Night Watchman in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Sacristan in Tosca, and Sir Tristram in Martha. Pini-Corsi returned to Italy in 1914. In 1915 he sang Don Pasquale and Dulcamara at the Teatro Regio Parma. His last opera appearance was in 1917 in Rossini's Il signor Bruschino at the Teatro Dal Verme, Milan, when his voice, if not as powerful or as steady as it had been 40 years before, was still as agile as ever and used with the same keen intelligence that had always distinguished his performances. He died in Milan, aged only 58, but his voice may be heard on a number of gramophone recordings which he made during the early years of the 20th century. He wrote a song called \\"Tu non mi vuoi pi√π bene\\", which was recorded by Enrico Caruso. ==References== *Elizabeth Forbes/Marco Beghelli: \\"Antonio Pini-Corsi\\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

It is one of the busiest transport hubs in the Berlin area. The station is named for the Alexanderplatz on which it is located, near the Fernsehturm and the World clock. ==Overview== Like other long-distance stations, Alexanderplatz is also a shopping centre for selling merchandise to travelers. Due to its importance and central location, it is a site where tourists regularly change. Alexanderplatz thereby became the second major hub of the Berlin U-Bahn network (along with Nollendorfplatz station). Four Regional-Express and Regionalbahn lines as well as the S-Bahn rapid transit lines , , , and call at the overground station. The adjacent underground station is one of the largest on the Berlin U-Bahn network, with the lines , and calling. The station is also served by four tram lines, two of which run continuously, as well as five bus lines during the day, one of which runs continuously and three night bus lines. Alexanderplatz is also connected through the two tunnel links, from U2 to U5 and U5 to U8. ==History== Alexanderplatz station, 1885 Alexanderplatz station opened on 7 February 1882 on the Berlin Stadtbahn viaduct from Charlottenburg to Ostbahnhof (then named Schlesischer Bahnhof). In 1926 the station hall spanning two platforms with four tracks was rebuilt in its present plain style. Heavily damaged in World War II, train service at the station was resumed on 4 November 1945, while the reconstruction of the hall continued until 1951. The first U-Bahn station of the present U2 line designed by Alfred Grenander entered service on 1 July 1913; then the eastern terminus of Berlin's second line from Potsdamer Platz via Spittelmarkt. The platforms of the U8 and the U5 opened on 18 April 1930 and 21 December 1930 respectively, also built according to Grenander's conception, but in a distinct Modern style. The U2 station was also renovated after the Alexanderplatz fire in 1972. The eastern entrances were destroyed on 15 March 1945. The U8 station was also a ghost station during the division of Berlin from 13 August 1961 to 1 July 1990. The station master offices were also built; these were shifted and walls were removed. The access at Dirksenstra√üe had to be made accessible again, just like the connecting stairs to the mall and to the platforms of Line E. Other than that, the intercommunication staircase was also built towards Line E so that it goes through the dimly lit platforms. Stainallee was renamed a few months after the closure of the stairs. In all cases, the metro stations had to be recognizable as such on the surface . The U-Bahn logo has been removed in recent years. This station also had to undergo renovation works from 17 May to 30 June 1990 before the full reopening on 1 July 1990. The U2 station had completely undergone renovation work in January 2001 to March 2001. The U5 station underwent renovation works from February 2003 to September 2004. It is also a U5 westbound terminus from 1930 to 2019, where it will be replaced by Berlin Hauptbahnhof. ==Train services== The station is served by the following service(s):Timetables for Berlin Alexanderplatz *Regional services Magdeburg ‚Äì Brandenburg ‚Äì Potsdam ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Erkner ‚Äì F√ºrstenwalde ‚Äì Frankfurt (Oder) (‚Äì Cottbus) *Regional services Wismar ‚Äì Schwerin ‚Äì Wittenberge ‚Äì Nauen ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì K√∂nigs Wusterhausen ‚Äì L√ºbben ‚Äì Cottbus *Regional services Dessau ‚Äì Bad Belzig ‚Äì Michendorf ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport ‚Äì W√ºnsdorf-Waldstadt *Local services Nauen ‚Äì Falkensee ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau ‚Äì Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Karlshorst ‚Äì K√∂penick ‚Äì Erkner *Berlin S-Bahn services Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Lichtenberg ‚Äì Strausberg Nord *Berlin S-Bahn services Potsdam ‚Äì Wannsee ‚Äì Westkreuz ‚Äì Hauptbahnhof ‚Äì Alexanderplatz ‚Äì Ostbahnhof ‚Äì Lichtenberg ‚Äì Ahrensfelde *Berlin S-Bahn services Spandau - Westkreuz - Hauptbahnhof - Alexanderplatz - Ostbahnhof - Sch√∂neweide - Flughafen Sch√∂nefeld == Gallery == Image:Berlin Alexanderplatz U-Bahnh√∂fe.svgStadtbahn and U-Bahn lines Image:Berlin_Alexanderplatz_U2_platform_northbound.jpgU2 platforms, looking to the north Image:U2 Alexanderplatz.jpgU2 platforms Image:Berlin_Alexanderplatz_U5_platforms.jpgU5 platforms Image:U-Bahn Berlin Alexanderplatz U5.JPGU5 platforms, with a new H type waiting to depart for H√∂now Image:U-Bahn Berlin Alexanderplatz U8.JPGU8 platforms Image:U-Bahn Berlin Alexanderplatz1.JPGU8 platforms, before its 2004 renovation File:Flexitityberlin.jpgFlexity Berlin tram at Alexanderplatz File:Metrobear Berlin 2011 ubt.JPGMetro-Bear-Berlin: This Buddy Bear with its map of the Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn can be found in the Alexanderplatz station ==References== ==External links== Alexanderplatz Alexanderplatz Category:Berlin U-Bahn stations Alexanderplatz Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1882 ","title":"Berlin Alexanderplatz station"},{"id":"9148493","text":"Mika ≈†piljak ( or ; 28 November 1916 ‚Äì 18 May 2007) was a Croatian politician in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ==Early years== He was born in Odra Sisaƒçka (part of Sisak), in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (present- day Croatia).

Previously he was a Roman Catholic priest and bishop, serving as Bishop of the Diocese of San Pedro from 1994 to 2005. He was elected as president in 2008, an election that ended 61 years of rule by the Colorado Party.http://www.medelu.org/The-red-bishop-in- Paraguay In 2012, he was removed from office through an impeachment process that neighboring countries deemed a coup d'√©tat. He was elected to the Senate of Paraguay in the 2013 general elections.Partido Colorado se alz√≥ como primera fuerza pol√≠tica en Paraguay ‚Äî teleSUR ==Early life== He received his basic education at a religious school in Encarnaci√≥n, and sold snacks on the streets.\\"Interview with Fernando Lugo, by C√©sar Sanson for Ag√™ncia Brasil de Fato\\" His family was not particularly religious; by his own account, he never saw his father set foot in a church.\\"Interview with Fernando Lugo, by C√©sar Sanson for Ag√™ncia Brasil de Fato\\" However, they were active in Colorado Party politics. His maternal uncle, Epifanio M√©ndez Fleitas, was a co- conspirator in the 1954 Paraguayan coup d'etat that helped bring Alfredo Stroessner to power. However, he later fell out of favor with Stroessner and ultimately left the country. Fernando's father was imprisoned twenty times, and some of his elder siblings were sent into so-called exile. ==Priesthood== His father wanted Lugo to become a lawyer, but at 18 Lugo entered a normal school, and began teaching in a rural community. He was well accepted by the community, which was very religious, but they had no priest. He said later that he was touched by that experience, and so discovered his vocation to the Roman Catholic priesthood. At age 19 he entered a seminary operated by the Society of the Divine Word. He was ordained a priest for the society on 15 August 1977. He was sent to Ecuador, where he served as a missionary for five years. In Ecuador he learned about liberation theology and taught classes at the Centro Biblio Verbo Divino in Quito. Lugo returned to Paraguay in 1982, and after a year, was sent to Rome for further academic studies.\\"Interview with Fernando Lugo, by C√©sar Sanson for Ag√™ncia Brasil de Fato\\" Lugo came back to Paraguay in 1987, two years before the Stroessner dictatorship's fall. Lugo was ordained a bishop on 17 April 1994, and received charge of the nation's poorest diocese, in the San Pedro diocese.\\"Interview with Fernando Lugo, by C√©sar Sanson for Ag√™ncia Brasil de Fato\\" Lugo resigned his ordinary from the Diocese of San Pedro on 11 January 2005. He had requested laicization in order to run for office. However, the Holy See refused the request on the grounds that bishops could not undergo laicization, and also denied him the requested canonical permission to run for civil elected office.Article regarding Lugo's laicization (in Spanish) However, after Lugo won the presidential election, the Church granted his laicization on 30 June 2008. ==Political career== Lugo jumped to the national arena by backing peasant claims for better land distribution. During 2006, opinion polls published by Diario ABC Color newspaper showed him as a possible choice for the opposition's presidential candidacy. Known as \\"the bishop of the poor\\", Lugo was seen in subsequent months as the most serious threat to the dominance of the Colorado Party on Paraguayan politics. Although he said he found the presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela interesting, he made a point to distance himself from leftist leaders in Latin America, focusing more on social inequality in Paraguay. On 23 February 2007, a Prensa Latina article noted that the Paraguayan Interior Ministry offered Lugo protection because of the death threats he received during the course of his political activities. ===Presidential candidacy=== According to a poll in February 2007, he was the leading contender in the April 2008 presidential election, with more than 37% of the voters' intention. On 29 October 2007, he registered as member of the small Christian Democratic Party of Paraguay (CDP), which allowed him to file as a candidate. The CDP became the core of the Patriotic Alliance for Change, a coalition of more than a dozen opposition parties and social movements which backed Lugo for President. Federico Franco of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest opposition party, was the candidate for Vice President. The legality of Lugo's candidacy was questioned, because Article 235 of the Constitution forbids clerics of any religious denomination to hold elective office, and Pope Benedict XVI had rejected Lugo's resignation from the priesthood.\\"Impugnaci√≥n de Lugo ser√° tratada por el comit√© ejecutivo de la ANR\\", abc.com.py . However, on 16 November 2007, President Nicanor Duarte Frutos (also Chairman of the Colorado Party) announced that the Party would not object to Lugo's candidacy, In July 2008, the Pope laicized Lugo, which made the question moot. ===President=== On 20 April 2008, Lugo won the election by a margin of 10%, gaining a 42.3% vote share. The Colorado Party candidate, Blanca Ovelar, acknowledged that Lugo had an unassailable lead and conceded the race that same night at about 9 pm local time. Two hours later, President Duarte acknowledged that the Colorados had lost an election for the first time in 61 years. Lugo's swearing in marked the first time in Paraguay's history (the country gained independence in 1811) that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to an elected member from the opposition. He became Paraguay's second leftist president (the first being Rafael Franco, who served from 1936 to 1937), and the first to be freely elected. Lugo was sworn in as President on 15 August 2008, saying he would not accept the presidential salary because it \\"belongs to more humble people\\" and encouraged other politicians to refuse their salaries as well.\\"Latin America's left wing swells with new Paraguay president\\" , AFP, 15 August 2008. He initially named Alejandro Hamed as his foreign minister. During the campaign, Lugo had suggested that he would switch diplomatic relations from the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the People's Republic of China, thereby depriving the ROC of its last diplomatic ally in South America. However, after the inauguration, which had been attended by President Ma Ying-jeou from Taiwan, Lugo stated that he had no plans to switch recognition. On 18 August 2008, Lugo named Margarita Mbywangi, a member of the Ach√© indigenous ethnic group, as secretary of indigenous affairs, the first indigenous person to hold such a position in Paraguay. Two of the main promises of Lugo's presidential campaign were tackling corruption and encouraging land reform. A number of initiatives were introduced to improve the lives of Paraguay's poor, such as investments in low-income housing,http://www.rabobank.com/content/images/Paraguay-201101_tcm43-105909.pdf the introduction of free treatment in public hospitals, and the introduction of cash transfers for Paraguay's most impoverished citizens. ===Cabinet=== * Minister of Foreign Relations: Alejandro Hamed Franco, Hector Lacognata and Jorge Lara Castro * Minister of Finance: Dionisio Cornelio Borda * Minister of Internal Affairs: Rafael Filizzola (PDP) * Minister of National Defence: Luis Bareiro Spaini, Cecilio P√©rez Bord√≥n and Catalino Luis Roy * Minister of Agriculture and Livestock: C√°ndido Vera Bejarano (PLRA) and Enzo Cardozo * Minister of Industry and Commerce: Mart√≠n Heisecke (PLRA) * Minister of Justice and Labor: Blas Llano (PLRA) and Humberto Blasco * Minister of Public Works and Communications: Efra√≠n Alegre (PLRA) and Cecilio P√©rez Bord√≥n * Minister of Public Health and Social Welfare: Esperanza Mart√≠nez (Frente Guas√∫) * Minister of Education and Culture: Horacio Galeano Perrone (ANR), Luis Riart (PLRA) and V√≠ctor R√≠os * Minister of Women: Gloria Godoy de Rubin * General Secretary of the Presidency: Miguel √Ångel L√≥pez Perito * Secretary of Public Function: Lilian Soto (Ku√±a Pyrenda) and Jos√© Tom√°s S√°nchez * Secretary of Technical Planification: Carlos S√°nchez y Bernardo Esquivel Vasken * Secretary of the Environment: Jos√© Luis Casaccia (ANR) * Secretary of Social Action: Paulino C√°ceres (Tekojoja) * Secretary of Culture: Ticio Escobar * Secretary of National Emergency: Camilo Soares (P-MAS) and Gladys Mercedes Cardozo Zacar√≠as * Secretary of Childhood and Adolescence: Liz Torres * Anti-drugs National Secretary: C√©sar Dami√°n Aquino * Director of the National Indigenous Institute: Margarita Mbywangi (Tekojoja) ===Impeachment=== On 15 June 2012, seventeen people were killed in a clash between landless farmers and the police who were trying to evict them; some sources consider that all this was taken as a pretext to expel Lugo. The Chamber of Deputies cited this event as well as insecurity, nepotism and a controversial land purchase to vote 76 to 1 to impeach Lugo on 21 June 2012.\\"Paraguay president faces impeachment after deadly clash\\", Mariano Castillo, CNN, 21 June 2012. The Senate took up the case the next day.\\"Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo faces impeachment\\", BBC, 21 June 2012. The impeachment was attended by a delegation of Foreign Affairs ministers from the other nations of the Union of South American Nations. The vote ended with 39 votes for Lugo's removal and four for his continuity, which ended his mandate and turned Federico Franco into the new president of Paraguay. Lugo announced that he would denounce the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, stating that the time to prepare a legal defence, just two hours, may be unconstitutional. The removal of Lugo was followed by demonstrations by his supporters. The presidents of Paraguay's neighbouring countries rejected Lugo's removal from office, and compared it to a coup d'√©tat. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff proposed suspending Paraguay's membership in Mercosur and the Union of South American Nations. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner of Argentina, Rafael Correa of Ecuador and Leonel Fern√°ndez of the Dominican Republic announced that they would not recognize Franco as president. Condemnation also came from more conservative governments in the region, such as Colombia and Chile. Lugo's removal has drawn comparisons to the ouster of Honduras' Manuel Zelaya in 2009; like the ouster of Lugo it was defended as legal and constitutional by its supporters while being denounced as a coup across the Latin American political spectrum. Lugo himself accepted his ouster, saying that any legal and realistic chance of reinstating him ended when the Supreme Court of Paraguay declared his impeachment and confirmed his removal, and the electoral court recognized Franco as the new president. However, he denounced it as \\"a congressional coup.\\"Reuters, 26 June 2012, Paraguay's Lugo says only miracle can reinstate him ===Senatorial candidacy=== In the 2013 election to replace his interim presidential replacement Lugo ran as a senate candidate. He was elected as member of Paraguayan Senate representing left-wing coalition Frente Guas√∫. ==Honors== Lugo was awarded the Order of Brilliant Jade by Ma Ying-jeou, the President of the Republic of China in March 2011. ==Personal life== As Lugo was unmarried during his presidency, he designated his elder sister, Mercedes Lugo, as First Lady of Paraguay. In August 2010, Lugo was diagnosed with non- Hodgkin lymphoma. He continued his duties as president of Paraguay while undergoing treatment. He also studied at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. ===Children=== Lugo fathered several children out of wedlock including one that was allegedly the result of sexual assault. These allegations from four mothers, who claimed that Lugo had fathered their children while under a vow of celibacy, emerged soon after his 2008 inauguration. One of the children was conceived with a sixteen-year-old girl (Paraguay's age of consent is 14 (click on PDF file in ‚Äútexto completo‚Äù)) while he was a bishop. ==References== ==External links== * Fernando Lugo profile at CatholicHierarchy website * 27 February 2007 New York Times article on Lugo's possible candidacy * 22 February 2007 article on Lugo from Worldpress.org * 30 December 2006 Daily (Maybe) blog on background to Lugo's presidential bid * Lugo Wins Election at AP * 18 April 2008 article on Lugo and Paraguay elections from The Christian Science Monitor * \\"Rise of the Red Bishop\\", The Guardian Weekly, 14 August 2008 *Biography by CIDOB - - Category:1951 births Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Impeached officials removed from office Category:Laicized Roman Catholic bishops Category:Living people Category:Paraguayan Christian socialists Category:Paraguayan Roman Catholic bishops Category:Paraguayan Roman Catholics Category:Paraguayan sociologists Category:People from Itap√∫a Department Category:People from San Pedro Department, Paraguay Category:People with cancer Category:Presidents of Paraguay Category:Presidents of the Senate of Paraguay Category:Presidents pro tempore of the Union of South American Nations Category:Universidad Cat√≥lica Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n alumni Category:Catholic socialists Category:Recipients of the Order of Brilliant Jade ","title":"Fernando Lugo"},{"id":"9148707","text":"Percy Pitt, before 1910 Percy Pitt (4 January 1869 - 23 November 1932) was an English organist, conductor, composer, and Director of Music of the BBC from 1924 to 1930. ==Biography== Pitt during his British National Opera Company period A native of London, Pitt studied music in Europe at the Leipzig conservatory, then at the Royal Academy of Music in Munich with Josef Rheinberger, and for six months in Berlin. Returning home in 1893, he became associated with the Queen's Hall which Robert Newman (an old family friend) had helped to build in 1893 and put on the first series of Promenade Concerts there in 1895. Pitt took over as accompanist at Queen's Hall in 1896 and accompanied the sung solo items at the first of Henry Wood's Prom concerts in August 1897.BBC Proms archive search. Accessed 3 January 2016. He was appointed by Henry ('Harry') Higgins in late 1902 as Music Advisor at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (where Andr√© Messager was Musical Director), also acting as musical coach and assistant stage conductor. He was assistant to Hans Richter in 1903, preparing the chorus and orchestra for a complete Ring cycle (given twice) under Richter's baton.The performances were \\"busting,\\" according to Pitt in a letter to Elgar, \\"but I need not tell you how great Richter was...\\" .The very first complete 'Ring' in England was conducted by Anton Seidl at Her Majesty's Theatre, 5‚Äì9 May 1882 (\\"Wagner's music in England\\". Musical Times, Vol. 47, No. 763, 1 September 1906, p. 593), and Gustav Mahler gave the first at Covent Garden in 1896: . Richter had given the very first complete Ring at the Bayreuth Festival in 1876. Richter conducted the Ring (in German) at Covent Garden in 1905, '06 and '07. Pitt became Director of Music at Covent Garden in 1907 after Messager's departure. In 1908, he was again Richter's assistant in a highly regarded production of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung sung in English. He remained with the company until 1915, when he joined the Beecham Opera Company as conductor. There he remained until 1920, when he became director of the British National Opera Company; he stayed with that company until 1924, when he was again associated with the Beecham Opera company. From May 1923 he was Musical Director of the British Broadcasting Company (succeeding L. Stanton Jefferies, who remained with the company in another role), becoming full-time Director of Music in November 1924, remaining there through its 1927 transition from the commercial to public sector, as the British Broadcasting Corporation, and until he was succeeded by Adrian Boult in 1930. Pitt died in London in 1932. His association with Richter gives special interest to his recordings of extracts from the Ring (1908 and 1921-2: all made for HMV). In his early years he enjoyed considerable repute as a composer of well-crafted light orchestral music. ==Conducting skills== \\"His conducting methods were a trifle peculiar. He had a habit of burying his head in the score and waving his arms over his head like a gesticulating stag-beetle... This habit rather detracted from the personal magnetism which great conductors exercise, owing to the orphaned orchestra seeing nothing less abstract than a baton.\\" ==List of works== ==References Notes = Citations = Sources === * (Edited from Pitt's unpublished MS autobiography) *David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition.

Forman was originally an athletic director, but his funny remarks led the management to place him on the stage as a comedian, though Forman wished to become a serious actor. Forman broke into show business after winning an Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts program.Gaver, Jack Joe Forman Has Good Season With Sid Caesar The Schenectady Gazette 8 January 1964 He first attracted attention in Las Vegas as the opening act for Mickey Rooney and also Rooney's straight man. He also co-starred in Mickey Rooney's 1954‚Äì1955 NBC sitcom The Mickey Rooney Show: Hey, Mulligan, as Mickey's best friend, Freddy, and appeared with him in the films Andy Hardy Comes Home (1958) and The Big Operator (1959). Forman was considered a standard Borscht Belt comic, and he performed standup comedy both live and on television (including shows like The Hollywood Palace). He also took on comedic roles in films and on television. Forman appeared in two episodes of The Monkees, first as jealous kids show host \\"Captain Crocodile\\" in an eponymous episode, then as Asian criminal \\"Dragonman\\" in \\"Monkees Chow Mein\\". He also appeared in three Get Smart episodes, including two episodes as \\"Harry Hoo\\", a parody of Charlie Chan. He also appeared in the final episode of the first season of M*A*S*H as a touring comedian performing for U.S. troops in the Korean War as well as in Episode #18 during the third season of Bewitched as Ho Ho the Clown.

Forman distinguished himself from the field by inventing a character called \\"The Mashuganishi Yogi\\", a parody of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In 1968, working with Bill Dana, he produced a comedy album consisting of a faux press conference, in which he responded to mostly-straight questions with funny answers, speaking in a stereotyped Indian accent. He was accompanied with a sitarist, \\"Harvey Shankar\\", a parody of Ravi Shankar (played by Dana). ==Later years/death== In later television appearances, he would sometimes reprise his Yogi character.

(PSI) is a non-profit organization charged with overseeing the international coalition of poetry slams. Established in 1997, PSI is responsible for making poetry slam more visible and accessible to the world via its flagship events: National Poetry Slam (NPS), Individual World Poetry Slam (iWPS), and the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWps). Their mission is \\"to promote the performance and creation of poetry while cultivating literary activities and spoken word events in order to build audience participation, stimulate creativity, awaken minds, foster education, inspire mentoring, encourage artistic statement and engage communities worldwide in the revelry of language\\". Though poetry slams are maintained in a growing number of cities by local volunteer organizers, the vast majority of slam series follow the rules established by PSI, PSI's founders and its members. Because of slam's exponential growth as an art form, PSI has emerged not only as an administrative body to maintain the rules which govern slams, but as an organization that seeks to grow slam's audience and protect slam's interests. The Executive Council, headed by a seven-member board of poets and slam organizers, plus a paid executive director, and voted on by representatives of local slams (SlamMasters) every two years, maintains a watch on poetry slam series worldwide, ensuring that slam remains an art form open to all competitors. Through the certification process and its annual organizational meetings, PSI has created the backbone for a community of poets who are in frequent communication with one another, in order to pool ideas and share creative resources to insure the future growth and recognition of slam. Poets from the community frequently embark on poetry tours in other cities, relying on each other to set up the organizational framework necessary for such tours to be successful. Recently PSI sought to improve the general public knowledge of slams through various projects such as the creation of an official website and of a summer workshop at SUNY-Oneota, the staging of slams on a major cable television network, and the organization each year of regional officially sanctioned team competitions in numerous host cities converging the more talented participants on the annual National Poetry Slam. ==History== Poetry Slam, Inc. came into existence on August 9, 1997. On November 9, 1999 PSI became an official State of Illinois Charitable Trust, and days later PSI was granted official tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Service Code, retroactive to the day of its inception. The goals set by the Amended Articles of Incorporation include educational and literary purposes such as: * ¬´advocate, promote, support, witness, and/or perpetuate the art of performance poetry¬ª, * ¬´enhance the perception of literary merit and legitimacy of performance poetry as an art form¬ª, * ¬´protect the artistic and financial interests of the National Poetry Slam community¬ª. == References == Category:Poetry slams Category:Spoken word Category:Poetry organizations ","title":"Poetry Slam, Inc."},{"id":"9148883","text":"Optics Communications is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Elsevier.

The exact number of compact discs produced is unknown, but can be assumed to be small because the label had no distribution network at the time.

Very little is known of his reign. Unlike his predecessor King Ricsige, who may have ruled most of the kingdom of Northumbria following the expulsion of the first King Ecgberht in 872, this Ecgberht ruled only the northern part of Northumbria, the lands beyond the Tyne in northern England and southern Scotland. The northern frontier of Ecgberht's kingdom is uncertain. Ricsige's death and Ecgberht's coming to power is recorded by Symeon of Durham, who writes, that in 876: > The pagan king Halfdene divided between himself and his followers the > country of the Northumbrians. Ricsig, king of the Northumbrians, died, and > Egbert the second reigned over the Northumbrians beyond the river > Tyne.Symeon of Durham, p. 493. In 883, recording the election of a king of the Vikings in York and southern Northumbria on the death of their leader Halfdene (Halfdan Ragnarsson), Symeon states: > Then St. Cuthbert, aiding by a vision, ordered abbot Eadred (who because he > lived in Luel was surnamed Lulisc) to tell the bishop and the whole army of > Angles and Danes, that by paying a ransom, they should redeem Guthred, the > son of Hardicnut, whom the Danes had sold as a slave to a certain widow at > Whittingham, and should raise him, then redeemed, to be king; and he reigned > over York, but Egbert over the Northumbrians.Symeon of Durham, p. 495. However, elsewhere it said that the second Ecgberht reigned two years, but this may refer to his claims to all Northumbria. Nick Higham sees Symeon's account of Guthred's election as an unhistorical record of a settlement between the York Vikings in southern Northumbria, and Ecgberht in northern, English Northumbria.Symeon of Durham, p. 761; Higham, p. 183. Ecgberht was succeeded by Eadulf I of Bernicia. ==Notes== ==References== * Higham, N.J., The Kingdom of Northumbria AD 350-1100. Stroud: Sutton, 1993. * Kirby, D.P., The Earliest English Kings.

It served as the third home of the Penn State University Nittany Lions football team, hosting the team until they moved in 1960 to Beaver Stadium. It was built to replace the original Beaver Field (1892‚Äì1908), retroactively called Old Beaver Field, which had a capacity of 500 and stood between present-day Osmond and Frear Laboratories. Prior to this, the team played on Old Main Lawn, a grassy area outside the main classroom building of the time. New Beaver Field was built to the northeast of Rec Hall on the present sites of the Nittany Lion Inn and the Nittany Parking Deck and held 30,000 people at its peak. In addition to football, the stadium had a track as well as baseball, lacrosse, and soccer fields. In 1959, the entire structure was disassembled and moved to the northeast corner of campus, where it was reassembled, expanded, and dubbed Beaver Stadium. Portions of the original 1909 design are still in use today. The stadium is named after James A. Beaver, who was a governor of Pennsylvania and a member of the school's board of trustees. ==History== In the early 1900 Penn State announced its plans to create an athletic complex northeast of Rec Hall on undeveloped land. The complex would contain a football field, track, lacrosse field, soccer field and baseball field. Making way for the new athletic fields construction began by leveling the 18 acres of land the complex would sit on. The university was loaned wagons and scrapers for the project by alumnus A. C. Reed and the team of workers lead by Bellefonte, Pennsylvania builder R. B. Taylor began to clear the land. Once completed the team of builders began digging drainage ditches and laying water pipes for upkeep of the fields. The construction team was paid a was paid a total of $15,000 () for the excavation and $8,000 () for ditch and pipe work bringing the total cost to $23,000 (). $15,000 was appropriated by the state of Pennsylvania for the field complex project. The university repurposed the existing grandstands from the old Beaver Field which sat 200 and built two wooden bleachers on either side that at 1000 giving the stadium an initial total capacity of 1,200. Once finished the complex was one of the largest athletic fields in the United States spanning 17 acres. Proposed plans for the New Beaver Field As construction was finishing a name had yet to be given to the field complex. This stirred up a debate amongst alumni and students about what the field should be named. Many wanted to keep the name Beaver Field to honor General James A. Beaver the former governor of Pennsylvania and university board of trustees president that helped secure funding for the former field. Others suggested that the field should be named after George W. Atherton the former president of the university who had died just years earlier. The field was dedicated on May 7, 1909 at an interscholastic track meet hosted by the University. The new complex received the name New Beaver Field with the former Beaver Field being retroactively renamed Old Beaver Field. Around 200 meet invitations were sent to high school teams around Pennsylvania. Penn State football hosts Bucknell University on Nov. 12, 1910, at New Beaver Field. As Penn State Football, Soccer and Lacrosse began playing home games on New Beaver Field the teams easily filled the 1200 capacity grandstands. The university continued to expand the seating capacity by building wood bleachers onto the existing grandstand. 4800 bleacher seats were added by the end of the 1920's bringing the total capacity of the stadium to 6000. The stadium‚Äôs seating was again restructured in the early 1920s due to increased student enrollment and ticket demand. The university demolished the old grandstands and installed two larger sets of bleacher seating on both the east and west sideline. The new upgrades allowed around 16,000 people to attend events hosted at the field. For large events when more seating was necessary, temporary stands around the end zones were erected to form a complete bowl bringing the total capacity to 20,000. Due to an increased press interest in the Nittany Lions, the university installed a press box in 1924. It was noted that the press box was a shack like structure with little room for reporters. ==References== ==External links== *Venue information Category:Defunct college football venues Category:Sports venues in Pennsylvania Category:Penn State Nittany Lions football ","title":"New Beaver Field"},{"id":"9149252","text":"The Econlockhatchee River (Econ River for short) is an U.S. Geological Survey.

The distinctive cover design was by John Patrick Byrne and was the start of a long working relationship between Rafferty and the playwright. The LP was well received, but performed poorly in charts and sales, in part because Rafferty had just left a well known band, The Humblebums. The album also saw Joe Egan come on board, and the pair formed Stealers Wheel shortly afterwards. The album was re-issued in 2000 on CD (subtitled \\"The Best of Gerry Rafferty\\") with a different cover design (Castle Music, Ltd; Cat. No. ESMCD-879).

It involved the construction of an estate of 177 houses in the Pennyland area of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. It compared possible future UK building efficiency standards with newly introduced Danish ones. Although identical externally, half the Pennyland houses (Area 1) were built to the proposed 1982 UK Building Regulations energy efficiency standards. The other half (Area 2) were built to the much more demanding 1977 Danish BR77 standard. (In Europe, BR77 and the Swedish SBN-80 standards set the benchmark for low- energy housing at the time.) Sponsored by the UK Department of Energy, Department of Environment and Milton Keynes Development Corporation, and using the technical expertise of the Open University Energy Research Group, the houses were constructed during 1979 and 1980. For comparison, two additional groups of control houses, already built in 1978, were studied on an adjoining site at Neath Hill. A further group, the Linford low energy houses were built to the Pennyland Area 2 standards and used for more detailed tests. ==Design== The Pennyland estate was laid out to take advantage of solar gain. The majority of houses faced south with the main living rooms located on the south side. They were designed with an insulated cavity wall with a poured concrete inner leaf to provide thermal mass. This had the added benefit of increasing airtightness. Nearly all were fitted with conventional radiator central heating systems. Several levels of insulation, heating system efficiency and passive solar design were compared: At Neath Hill most houses featured *conventional 'heavyweight' gas boilers *50 mm roof insulation *no cavity wall insulation *Single glazing *No floor edge insulation *No special passive solar measures About 20 of the Neath Hill houses were retrofitted with foam cavity fill wall insulation. The Pennyland Area 1 houses featured: *low thermal capacity gas boilers *80 mm loft insulation *50 mm cavity wall insulation *Single glazing *No floor edge insulation *Passive solar layout and features The Pennyland Area 2 houses (almost Danish BR77 standards) featured: *low thermal capacity gas boilers *150 mm loft insulation *100 mm cavity wall insulation *Double glazing *25 mm insulation under the edge of the floor slab *Passive solar layout and features ==Lessons learned== The houses were monitored over the winters of 1981 and 1982 with energy and internal temperatures being measured in a large sample of houses on a weekly average basis. More detailed monitoring on an hourly basis was carried out on the Linford houses. Among the lessons learned were: *Overall the Pennyland Area 2 houses demonstrated a halving in gas consumption for space and water heating compared to the 'normal' Neath Hill houses. *The low thermal capacity gas boilers showed large energy savings compared to the conventional 'heavyweight' type. *The poured concrete construction used at Pennyland made the houses extremely airtight. *The overall package of energy conservation measures had a payback time of only four years. *The passive solar features were popular, but the energy savings were modest and their use constrained estate layout. The savings were limited by the use of net curtains and privacy considerations. *The Pennyland houses suffered from minor mould growth in kitchens and bathrooms; a downside of the good airtightness. ==Impact== The short payback times encouraged Milton Keynes Development Corporation to introduce its own Building Regulation standards for new housing within the city leading to the major 1986 Energy World demonstration project and exhibition. The issue of mould growth in air-tight houses has since been tackled by Building Regulation requirements for specific ventilation in kitchens, bathrooms and toilets. The levels of insulation tested at Pennyland and Great Linford in the early 1980s were only surpassed in the UK Building Regulation requirements in 2002. ==See also== *Energy World *Energy efficiency in British housing *Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom *Sustainable development *Energy conservation *Passivhaus low-energy building standard *:Category:Low-energy building ==References== *Pennyland project report, J Chapman, R Lowe & R Everett (1985); Open University Energy Research Group, Summary and Main report *Social survey ‚Äì Pennyland residents; S Meikle; Milton Keynes Development Corporation *Low Energy Houses, R Everett, A Horton and J Doggart (1985); Open University Energy Research Group, Summary and Main report ==External links== * Energy Projects in Milton Keynes, Fuller, S.; Doggart, J. and Everett, R.

The airport closed on February 18, 1996. The FAA deemed the airport unsafe due to a large landfill next to the airport, causing many seagulls, which disrupted airport operations. Its IATA code was FLR. The site of the airport is now an industrial park. Northeast Airlines was discussed as a possible service provider to Fall River but it never happened. There was one attempt to have the city served by Mohawk Airlines but that failed too. The airport was built by The U.S. government as an \\"auxiliary\\" field associated with Quonset Naval Air Station and was once home to a few Massachusetts Air National Guard helicopters. From the early 1960s the city performed minimal maintenance. Runway lighting was marginally kept working by volunteer pilots who used the facility. There were attempts at revival but none achieved much success. In addition to the bird hazard from the landfill, numerous large apartment buildings were built nearby. Lack of security, including only rudimentary fencing, resulted in frequent vandalism to aircraft causing many owners to move to nearby New Bedford and Taunton (Massachusetts) airports. ==References== Category:Airports in Bristol County, Massachusetts Category:Defunct airports in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Fall River, Massachusetts Category:1951 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Fall River Municipal Airport"},{"id":"9149423","text":"The Bon Soo Winter Carnival is an annual winter carnival in Sault Ste.

They threaten to replace him. Dickson argues that he loans to people he personally knows are good risks and that none of them has defaulted, and that loaning the money keeps it circulating, without which the Depression would get even worse. He refuses to resign. His wife Phyllis (Kay Johnson) drops by. She is planning a special date for their anniversary that night, but he has forgotten it and made business plans. He promises to go out with her the next night, but promptly arranges another business meeting then. Three gangsters led by Dude Finlay (Robert Ellis) enter the office of chief cashier Cyril Cluett (Gavin Gordon) to intimidate him. He owes them $50,000 in gambling debts, and they promise not to hurt him if he helps them rob the bank that night. They advise him to arrange an alibi for midnight, when the robbery will be. Seeing Phyllis, he claims to have always been in love with her and asks to go out with him that night. She decides to have some harmless fun while Tom is unavailable, and agrees to do it. However, they are seen by Matt Brown (Pat O'Brien), who assumes the worst about Dickson's marriage. Cluett resets the vault's time lock before leaving to meet Phyllis. They go to a play, then to his apartment; but Brown is there waiting for them, hoping to break up their affair. Meanwhile at the bank, the gang steals $100,000, but they also murder a guard who sees them. The next day, rumors about the amount stolen become wildly exaggerated and cause a run on the bank. Dickson tries frantically to arrange emergency money to meet the withdrawals but cannot, and the board will not help, preferring to force him out. The bank still has enough resources to pay all depositors eventually, but its reputation for safety will be gone if they cannot withdraw money now. Meanwhile, the police suspect Brown, who will only say he was at home with a married woman he will not name. Eventually they hear about Cluett being seen with Dude Finlay and turn their suspicions to him. Brown is cleared, but as they talk about alibis, he blurts out Phyllis's name in Dickson's presence. Dickson, too, believes the worst about his marriage. He becomes depressed and agrees to resign his job. As the bank runs out of cash, the other bankers have an idea. They call on the people Tom Dickson has helped with loans in the past, to come in and visibly deposit all the money they can afford. They also call Phyllis, who reassures Dickson of her love. When the board sees the loyal depositors, they rally around to support Dickson, arranging immediate deliveries of money themselves. The bank is saved; Dickson recovers his positive attitude and keeps his job. Finally Tom Dickson gives Matt Brown the promotion he has been hoping for, and \\"orders\\" him to marry his girlfriend, Dickson's own secretary Helen (Constance Cummings).

It opened officially on 27 September 1831 using horse traction, and had the track gauge of that had been adopted by the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, with which it was to connect. It was dependent on the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway for access to the best areas of the coalfields, but eventually it by-passed this constraint by extending its line southwards through Coatbridge, enabling a direct link with another coal railway, the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. Widening its horizons it changed its name to the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway. The track gauge originally chosen was now a limitation and it altered its gauge to the standard of . When the Caledonian Railway advanced on Glasgow, the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge provided a ready-made access route, and the Caledonian company purchased the Garnkirk line. Most of its original route remains open today. ==Origins== Route map of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway In the eighteenth century, the city of Glasgow experienced increasing demand for coal, both for domestic and industrial purposes; the most convenient source was the Monkland coalfield, south of Airdrie, but the distance of over ten miles incurred considerable expense in the absence of an efficient means of transport. The Monkland Canal was opened in 1791,Glasgow Courier 18 October 1791, quoted by Martin reducing the price of coal in Glasgow considerably. However a cartel of some of the coal owners attempted to keep prices artificially high, and from 1813 they managed to achieve a near- monopoly of the supply of Monkland coal, with the canal also charging monopolistic prices for carriage. By 1823 the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&KR;) was being promoted, connecting the coalfield with the Forth and Clyde Canal at Kirkintilloch. Although this provided a route to Glasgow by-passing the Monkland Canal, \\"there seems little doubt that the principal intention of the M&KR; promoters was the provision of a convenient route for Monkland coal to the Edinburgh market.\\"Don Martin, The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, Strathkelvin District Libraries and Museums, 1981 Accordingly, it was the principal coal consumers in Glasgow who were dominant in proposing a railway to convey coal directly to Glasgow. The chief sponsors included Charles Tennant & Co, who had their St. Rollox chemical works at Townhead, Glasgow, adjacent to the Monkland Canal. The railway was called The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, (G&GR;) indicating the route and destination of the new railway; although there were extensive fireclay deposits at Garnkirk, it was not an important terminal of the new railway: most of the mineral traffic would originate on the M&KR; system. The company was to have authorised capital of ¬£28,497 17s 4d.Joseph Priestley, A Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways, of Great Britain, Longman, Rees Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831 The new company got its Act of Parliament on 26 May 1826, and the Act empowered it to make the necessary connection to the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. The Act stipulated that the company could not issue dividends of more than 10% unless they reduced their tolls to stated amounts. There was a decision to alter the course of the railway, and this involved an additional ¬£11,000 capital. The junction was to be at Bedlay (near modern Muirhead), and would have followed a more northerly route than that actually built. However the promoters decided it would be advantageous to shorten the extent of usage of the rival M&KR; line, and to make the gradients more favourable to loaded traffic. Accordingly, a new Act was sought, and obtained on 14 June 1827, authorising the junction to be at Gartsherrie, and the Glasgow terminal to be at the \\"cut of junction\\" where the Monkland Canal and the Forth and Clyde Canal met. The amendment act also authorised increased capital of ¬£9,350. Accordingly, the route was from the junction with the M&KR; at Gartsherrie, near the Gargill Colliery, running via Gartcloss, Gartcosh, Garnkirk, Robroyston, Milton, Broomfield, Germiston, Rosebank and Pinkston to terminate at the Glasgow depot at Townhead. The Townhead depot was at the point where Keppochhill Road crossed the Forth and Clyde Canal. The M8 motorway and Springburn Road junction system has obliterated the site, but it was approximately at the present-day western end of Charles Street.Christopher Awdry, An Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, ==Construction== Contracts were swiftly let, and the first sod was cut on 28 August 1827. The engineers were Thomas Grainger and John Miller, who were also engineers to the M&KR.;WhishawC J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, The railway was planned to have gentle gradients and a good alignment, in contrast to the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line and other short mineral lines, and of the nearly extent, the first (eastern) were level and the remainder descended at 1 in 144. It was designed to be a locomotive line from the outset‚Äîa far-sighted decision, although it incurred considerable extra expense in heavier track construction. This required heavy earthworks, with large embankments at Gartcloss, Gartcosh, Provanmill and Germiston, and deep cuttings at Gartcosh, Blackfauld and Provanmill. Moreover, considerable work was needed to form the railway across Robroyston Moss: after levelling, tree branches were placed on the track bed, and on them longitudinal timber beams were laid; cross-beams of Scotch fir were fixed on them, and then longitudinal planks of red pine, (broad x thick) were laid on them; finally the rails of were laid on the planks. Elsewhere on the line fish bellied rails to Birkinshaw's patent‚Äîanother far-sighted decision‚Äîat in lengths were laid on stone blocks each weighing . The line was built to the track gauge, which had been adopted by the M&KR; interchange of wagons with that line was essential. Francis Whishaw, writing in 1839, stated that there were six level crossings on the line. Construction was delayed by exceptionally bad weather, and the company had to obtain parliamentary authority for additional capital, which it obtained on 17 June 1830 for a further ¬£21,150. The first revenue traffic was carried in March 1831, when coal was sent eastwards from Gartcloss Colliery to the M&KR; system, but during May 1831 horse-drawn coal trains from Monklands to Glasgow started operating. ==Operation and traffic== Now following swiftly on from the opening, a passenger service was started on 1 June 1831, running from the G&GR; Townhead terminus and Leaend, on the margin of Airdrie, on the Ballochney Railway, the trains operating intermediately over the M&KR.; There were four journeys every day. Moreover, Buchanan reported that: > Each time, also, the engine starts with a load of coals from the upper part > of the line, or with empty waggons returning, a small passenger waggon is > attached, not being regulated by any hour, and a considerable number of > stragglers find their way in this manner along the line.George Buchanan, in > Views of the Opening of the Glasgow and Garnkirk Railway; also an Account of > That and Other Railways in Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, 1832, quoted in Robertson At the end of June 1831 the company's first locomotive entered service; it was named St Rollox and was a 2-2-0 of the Planet type, built by Robert Stephenson and Company, and was applied to the passenger service. The M&KR; would not allow the locomotive on to their track, and the trains were horse-drawn from Gargill (Gartsherrie) eastwards. This more modern type of locomotive again demonstrated the G&GR;'s dynamic thinking. A double line of rails was ready by September 1831, and on 27 September a ceremonial opening of the line took place.Don Martin, The Monkland and Kirkintilloch and Associated Railways, Strathkelvin Public Libraries, Kirkintilloch, 1995, Garnkirk & Glasgow Railway (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, 1831), The Glasgow Story ==Coal railways== The railway companies that opened in the Monklands and Glasgow area became known as the coal railways, marking both their primary traffic and their inter-dependency. The G&GR; company was dependent on the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line for originating traffic from the Monklands coalfield, and when the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&CR;) opened in 1833, its traffic from further south passed over the M&K; line too. Although the G&GR; had planned for locomotive operation, there was evidently also significant horse-drawn traffic. The M&KR; was seeking parliamentary authority to double their line, and the G&GR; tried to get a clause giving them running powers to the Wishaw and Coltness line. The G&GR; argued that when the M&K; line was doubled, traffic for each direction should be allocated to each track; the G&GR; argued that the two tracks should be allocated to locomotive use and (their own) horse-drawn trains respectively. There was clearly friction between the two companies, arising from horse-operated G&GR; trains delaying M&KR; locomotive trains.House of Commons debate 18 June 1833, reported in Robertson However, by 1838 the G&GR; was operating locomotives over the G&GR; and the W&CR.;Report of Committee of Management of Wishaw & Coltness Railway, 5 February 1838, quoted in Robertson ==Passenger trains from Edinburgh== When the Slamannan Railway opened on 31 August 1840, it proposed a through passenger service between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The Slamannan company's eastern terminal was at Causeway, on the Union Canal, some distance from the capital. On 30 July 1840 the service started, involving a passage on the canal from Port Hopetoun in Edinburgh; traversing the Slamannan company's line, which included a rope- worked incline at Causewayend; the Ballochney Railway, including the double rope-worked inclined place at Commonhead; the Monkland & Kirkintilloch Railway between Kipps at Gartsherrie; and the G&GR; itself. For a while this transit was the prime route between Edinburgh and Glasgow (Townhead), taking about five hours. It lasted until February 1842 when the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened, putting paid to any through traffic over the Slamannan route. Mixed locomotive and horse operation led to difficulties; in 1840 the company drew up byelaws laying down that passenger trains in both directions should share one track with eastbound (i.e. unloaded) horse trains, and the other dedicated to westbound, loaded, horse trains. Waggons were always to give way to passenger trains and to locomotives, and were not to start on a journey unless certain of reaching a siding before being overtaken.Parliamentary Papers 1841 quoted in Robertson (It is not clear how they could know this in the absence even of primitive telecommunications.) By the first half of 1845, the company was carrying all the coal traffic on its line, while outside carriers conveyed 19% of \\"other goods\\".Parliamentary Papers, Report of the Railway Department for 1844-1845, quoted in Robertson In this period, attention was being drawn to the high cost of operation of the line; in 1839 - 1843 gross revenue was ¬£15,337 and working expenditure was 51.3% of that sum.Table 19 in Robertson ==The Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway== The Glasgow Garnkirk and Coatbridge system in 1846 Friction between the G&GR; and the neighbouring M&KR; developed. The M&KR; passenger station at Coatbridge (\\"The Howes\\") was constantly complained of by the G&GR; as being a deterrent to passengers. A more fundamental issue was the intensive traffic over the M&KR; section, crossing a junction of main roads at Coatbridge. Moreover, the Wishaw and Coltness Railway (W&CR;) relied on the M&KR; section to convey coal from its line to the G&GR.; The M&KR; refused to allow locomotives on its line, even though the two other railways used them routinely. At length the G&GR; decided to build its own independent line paralleling, and by-passing, the M&KR;, and connecting directly with the W&CR; line. When it sought parliamentary authority it changed its name to the more appropriate Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (GG&CR;). It was formed on 19 July 1844. Running north-south between Gartsherrie and Whifflet, and to the west of the M&KR; line, the new route opened in July 1845. It crossed the Monkland Canal and Bank Street in Coatbridge by a bridge, and it crossed the M&KR; Rosehall branch on the level. There was a new Coatbridge station, which much later became . ==The Caledonian Railway== From 1844 business interests were promoting the idea of a new railway from Carlisle to both Edinburgh and Glasgow. The old coal railways had already found themselves at a disadvantage with their non-standard track gauge of , which prevented interchange of traffic with the more modern railways that were developing. The Caledonian Railway offered considerable extra traffic, by connecting to the Wishaw and Coltness line at Garriongill, and continuing to Glasgow over it and the GG&CR.; As the Caledonian line was to be standard gauge (), this was obviously contingent on those railways changing their gauge to suit. In fact all the coal railways decided to change in concert, and did probably on 26 August 1847 and for a few days after. There was a miners' strike at this time, so the cessation of mineral traffic for the work was not as difficult as it might have been. The Caledonian Railway pursued its plans to enter Glasgow, and also to reach Stirling and Perth by building from near Gartsherrie to meet the projected Scottish Central Railway at Greenhill. The Caledonian negotiated to acquire both the W&CR; and the GG&CR;, and in fact it leased the GG&CR; from 1 January 1846. On 3 August 1846 an Act of Parliament was obtained for amalgamation, and final amalgamation occurred on 29 June 1865. The GG&CR; company was not dissolved until 2 August 1880. ==ReferencesNotes=Sources=== * * Cunnison, J. and Gilfillan, J.B.S., (1958). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland: Glasgow.

He left the party in 1942 disillusioned, and returned to a high-ranking police force position in October 1944 to help people in mortal danger from the Holocaust.

In the second week of January 1945, Raoul found out that Adolf Eichmann planned a massacre in the Budapest ghetto. The only one who could stop it was the man given the responsibility to carry the massacre out, the commander of the German troops in Hungary, Major General Gerhard Schmidhuber. Through Szalai, Wallenberg sent Schmidhuber a note promising that he, Raoul Wallenberg, would make sure the general was held personally responsible for the massacre and that he would be hanged as a war criminal when the war was over. The general knew that the war would be over soon and that the Germans were losing. The massacre never took place.Incredible People: Wallenberg According to Giorgio Perlasca, who posed as the Spanish consul- general to Hungary in the winter of 1944 and saved 5218 Jews, P√°l Szalai lied to save his life during his criminal trial, and the history of the saving is different.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Oral history interview with Giorgio Perlasca, 5 September 1990Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Mixer, Giorgio Perlasca, Giovanni Minoli, Rai, 1990VareseNews, Gli uomini giusti muoiono di sabato, 22 May 2010Interview by Enrico Deaglio to Giorgio Perlasca, from: Fondazione Giorgio Perslasca, Giorgio Perlasca - il mixer israeliano in ebraico, 1990 Raoul Wallenberg saved hundreds of people but was not directly involved in the plan to save the ghetto. While Perlasca was posing as the Spanish consul-general, he came to know about the intention to burn down the ghetto. Shocked and incredulous, he asked for a direct hearing with the Hungarian interior minister G√°bor Vajna, in the basement of the Budapest City Hall where he had his headquarter, and threatened fictitious legal and economic measures against the \\"3000 Hungarian citizens\\" (in fact, a much smaller number) declared by Perlasca as residents of Spain, and the same treatment by two Latin American governments, to force the minister to withdraw the project. This actually happened in the following days. ===After the war=== After the war, Szalai was one of few high-ranking members of the Arrow Cross Party not executed. He was set free in recognition of his cooperation with Wallenberg. ===Show trial preparations 1953 in Hungary=== Preparations for a show trial started 1953 in Budapest to \\"prove\\" that Wallenberg had never been in the Soviet Union, nobody had dragged off Wallenberg in 1945, least of all the Soviet Army. Everything was ready for a trial designed to prove that Wallenberg had been the victim of cosmopolitan Zionists. Three leaders of the Jewish community of Budapest Dr. L√°szl√≥ Benedek, Lajos St√∂ckler, and Miksa Domonkos, as well as two additional \\"eyewitnesses\\" P√°l Szalai and K√°roly Szab√≥ were arrested and tortured. The preparations for the show trial were initiated in Moscow, as part of Joseph Stalin's increasing antisemitic and anti-Zionist campaign - e.g. Solomon Mikhoels murder, Night of the Murdered Poets (of the World War II time Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee), Slansky Trial, Doctors' Plot. After Stalin's death on March 5, 1953 and as Lavrentiy Beria was executed, the trial was aborted and the arrestees released in fall 1953.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football at Arizona State, where he received consensus All-American honors. Miller also played for the Seattle Seahawks, with whom he earned a Super Bowl ring in Super Bowl XLVIII over the Denver Broncos. ==Early years== Miller was born in Tempe, Arizona and attended Altadena Middle School as well as Desert Vista High School in nearby Phoenix, where he played football and competed in track. Miller played in the 2004 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, which is an annual all-star game for the nation's best high school football players. Also a standout performer in the throwing events, Miller was a three-year letterman in track & field, and he set the school discus record and was the shot put regional champion in 2004. He had personal-best throws of 49.20 meters in the discus throw and 15.93 meters in the shot put. ==College career== Miller enrolled at Arizona State University, where he played for the Arizona State Sun Devils football team from 2004 to 2006. In three seasons at Arizona State, he caught 144 passes for 1,512 yards, and 14 touchdown receptions. He was named a John Mackey Award finalist in 2006. Miller was an All-America selection by the AFCA and the Walter Camp Foundation in 2006. ==Professional career== Miller with the Raiders in 2008 ===Oakland Raiders=== Miller was projected to be a first round pick; however, his slightly disappointing performance at the combine caused him to be drafted early in the second round (38th overall), by the Oakland Raiders. The Raiders selected him after many disappointments at the team's tight end position, including Doug Jolley, Courtney Anderson, and Randal Williams. He finished his rookie year with 44 catches for 444 yards and 3 touchdowns. Miller was added to the AFC 2011 Pro Bowl roster after Antonio Gates withdrew due to injury. Miller led the Raiders in receiving in 2008, 2009, and 2010, totaling 60 receptions for 685 yards and a career-high five touchdowns during the 2010 campaign. His receptions total was the eighth-highest among NFL tight ends. Miller moved into third place on the Raiders career receiving list for tight ends with 226 receptions over four seasons. His career totals during his time with Oakland include 2,712 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns. ===Seattle Seahawks=== On August 2, 2011, Miller signed with the Seattle Seahawks on a 5-year, $34 million deal, $17 million of which is guaranteed. Head Coach Pete Carroll stated that Miller would become a great part of the offense. He finished off his first season with 25 receptions for 233 yards and no touchdowns catches. Miller was played more as a blocking tight end during the season. In the 2012-13 NFL Playoffs, Miller was the leading receiver for the Seahawks in both games, and had 142 yards in the 30‚Äì28 loss to the Atlanta Falcons.

It was one of the many under strength Panzer divisions formed during the last years of the war. == History  Organisation and build up === Adolf von Schell 1 January 1943 ‚Äì 15 November 1943 The 'Rhineland-Westphalia 25th Panzer' was formed in Norway on 15 May 1941 as the 'Sch√ºtzenverband Oslo', It was created to spearhead the possible invasion of Sweden and a full Panzer Division was not considered necessary for this task. When the Russian campaign did not end in 1941 as planned, the Verband was re-designated the 25th Panzer Division on 25 February 1942, although there was little increased strength to the original numbers of the Verband. Divisional staff were formed in Eberswalde Germany, (their new home station) and arrived in Oslo, Norway on 5 March. Existing units were renamed, and new ones formed in order to get the new division to actual divisional strength, although it remained well under even when it moved to France in September 1943. Soon after its creation in February, the division engaged with Norwegian Partisans near Rjukan, and then in late August sailed to Denmark to take part in Operation Tivoliasflug, the disarming of the Danish Army. After being transferred to Northern France in September/October for training exercises, the division was sent east, and eventually arrived on the Eastern front (central sector) in early November 1943. === Eastern Front === In October 1943, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front and was attached to the 4th Panzer Army under Army Group North Ukraine. Commanded by General der Panzertruppe Georg Jauer, the division arrived on the Ukrainian Front on 8 November. At that time, the 4th Panzer Army was in serious trouble due to Soviet attacks which had captured Kiev and the Red Army was in a position to encircle the whole 4th Panzer Army. Being thrown straight into the battle by the High Command, the 25th Panzer Division drove forward but was halted by the advancing Soviet 7th Guards Tank Corps that had just captured Zhitomir. As the month went on, the situation changed with the arrival of the elite 1st SS Division, along with the 1st and 7th Panzer Divisions, under the command of 48th Panzer Corps (who also commanded the 25th). These were battle hardened, full-strength units that drove north then west to retake Zhitomir where the 25th became involved in heavy fighting. To counter this assault, the Russians attacked with the 7th Guards Tank Corps and a huge tank battle ensued, although not on the same scale seen at Kursk a few months previously. The heavy fighting continued until the end of November, when mud halted all operations. Although suffering heavy losses, largely due to inexperience, the division had played a significant role in halting a major Soviet advance east of Fastov (southwest of Kiev), as well as participating in the counterattacks against the Kiev Salient. At the start of the new year in 1944, the division had lost all offensive capabilities; in the following months, the retreat across Ukraine left the division with only 8,000 men when it was encircled with the 1st Panzer Army in Hube's Pocket and was almost completely destroyed. === Refitting and further fighting on the Eastern Front === In April 1944, the division was sent to Aalborg in Denmark to rebuild and where they absorbed the main forces of Panzer Division Norway as much needed reinforcements. By now, the hard-pressed Wehrmacht, which were now fighting on two fronts, was only able to raise a skeleton Panzer division. In September 1944, the situation was so bad on the Eastern front that although completely under strength, the division was sent again to battle the Red Army at the Vistula crossings in Poland and in the defense of Warsaw, also parts of it were involved in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. On 6 November 1944, after months of bitter fighting, the division was finally reinforced once more. Remnants of other brigades and battalions were absorbed, along with 25 Panther tanks which were much needed. In January 1945, after the defense of Warsaw, the division could only field a total of around 68 tanks, assault and self-propelled anti- aircraft guns: 5 Panzer IV, 15 Panzer IV/70, 21 Jagdpanzer IV/48, 23 Panther tanks and 4 Flakpanzer IV. The 25th and 19th Panzer Divisions counterattacked strongly, but were ultimately ineffective and were forced to retreat back the Oder River. By the end of January, the division had lost 622 men killed, 2,318 wounded, and 6,030 missing, a total of 8,970 casualties in only six weeks. === Last months of the war === After the retreat to the Oder River in January 1945, the division lost nearly all its tanks and had suffered irreplaceable losses. In April, the division was transferred to Vienna in Austria, and then posted north of the Danube river to protect the Austrian oil fields. By this time the 25th Panzer Division could no longer be classed as a viable fighting force. Down to 45 operational Panzers and manpower falling rapidly everyday, the division reluctantly fought on at Prottes, Hohenruppersdorf, Martinsdorf, and Schrick, eventually ending the war in Austria. Alongside the 11th Panzer Division, the 25th surrendered to the advancing Americans. === Equipment === The quality of the equipment was mixed since the division was issued with outdated French tanks, such as the Renault R35, Hotchkiss H39 and Char B1 and different models of the panzer tanks. Some German Tiger tanks (one company) were also reportedly in operation with the 25th. The artillery regiment had modern artillery pieces, but was the size of a battalion and so could only give limited fire support. The reconnaissance battalion had no armoured cars, it was made up entirely of motorcycles. At its height in the Summer of 1943, the division stood at a strength of 21,000 men and fielded 14 Panzer II tanks, 62 Panzer IIIs, 26 Panzer IVs, 40 Hotchkiss H39, 15 Somua S35, and 15 self- propelled assault guns such as the StuG III. ==Commanding officers== *Generalleutnant Johann Haarde, 25 February 1942 *Generalleutnant Adolf von Schell, 1 January 1943 *General der Panzertruppe Georg Jauer, 15 November 1943 *Generalleutnant Hans Tr√∂ger, 20 November 1943 ‚Äì 10 May 1944 *Generalmajor Oswin Grolig, 1 June 1944 *Generalmajor Oskar Aud√∂rsch, 18 August 1944 ‚Äì May 1945 == Order of battle, April 1943, Ukraine == * Panzer Regiment 9 * Panzer Grenadier Regiment 146 * Panzer Grenadier Regiment 147 * Panzer Artillery Regiment 91 (undersized) * Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion 25 * Motorcycle Battalion 8 * Panzerj√§ger Battalion 87 (Tank Destroyer Battalion) * Panzer Engineer Battalion 87 * Panzer Signal Battalion 87 * Panzer Pioneer Battalion 87 * Feldersatz Battalion (Field Replacement Battalion) == See also == *Battle of Kiev (1943) *List of German divisions in World War II *Organisation of a SS Panzer Division *Panzer division == References == * The Panzer Legions: A Guide to the German Army Tank Divisions of World War Two * The German Theater of Northern Operations: 1940-1945 25 Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ","title":"25th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)"},{"id":"9149692","text":"Raymond I (died 865) was the Count of Limoges (from 841), Rouergue and Quercy (from 849), and Toulouse and Albi (from 852).

Azis initially rose to prominence in Eastern Europe performing songs mostly in chalga, a genre which can be described as the Bulgarian rendition of pop-folk. Azis has collaborated with other Bulgarian pop-folk singers, such as Gloria, Malina, Sofi Marinova, Toni Storaro, and with Bulgarian rap artists ‚Äì Ustata and Vanko 1. Other than that, his repertoire includes duets with Serbian singers, including Indira Radiƒá, Marta Saviƒá and Jelena Karleu≈°a. Boyanov performed \\"Let Me Cry\\" at the 2006 Eurovision song contest with Mariana Popova, staying in the semi-finals. Other than his acclaimed career as a vocalist, he competed unsuccessfully in the Bulgarian parliamentary election of 2005 as a member of the EuroRoma party. Azis remains a prominent figure in the Bulgarian music scene. == Biography == Azis was born Vasil Troyanov Boyanov in Sliven, although his childhood was spent in Kostinbrod and Sofia. In 1989, after the fall of communism in Bulgaria, he moved with his family to Germany. There, his sister, Matilda, and brother Ryan were born. Azis married Nikolay Petrov Parvanov (stage name: Niki Kitaetsa, Cyrillic: –ù–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ü–∞) on 1 October 2006. Their marriage is not legally recognized under Bulgarian law. Azis' daughter was born on 5 August 2007 and was named Raya. Her mother is Azis' longtime friend, Gala. In 2008, Azis and Parvanov separated amicably. == Homosexuality controversies == In late November 2007, Boyko Borisov, then mayor of Sofia, censored billboards of Azis kissing Niki Kitaetsa, which pictured both men shirtless on the basis they were too graphic in nature. The picture was then censored in other cities in Bulgaria. == Appearances == * In 2007, Azis and Kitaetsa appeared in the VIP Brother 2 edition of Big Brother Bulgaria. Azis left the house voluntarily after nineteen days. * Azis was interviewed in the second episode of Michael Palin's New Europe. * In 2008 on PRO.BG, Azis co-hosted the talk show Azis' Late Night Show with actress Ekaterina Evro. * In August 2012, Anonymous used the video clip to Azis' song –ú—Ä–∞–∑–∏—à to deface the website of the Russian court Khamovnichesky, where the members of the band Pussy Riot were convicted. * Azis was a contestant on the widely popular reality show –ö–∞—Ç–æ –¥–≤–µ –∫–∞–ø–∫–∏ –≤–æ–¥–∞, which is the Bulgarian version of Your Face Sounds Familiar. After the 12 weeks and a wide spectre of enjoyed performances, he placed 2nd. == Covers == Greek laiko vocalist Panos Kiamos, made a cover of Azis' single Sen Trope entitled, Fotia me Fotia, (Fire to Fire). Serbian pop-folk singer Dragan Kojiƒá Keba covered the same song as \\"Ona to zna\\" (She knows), the Romanian singer Florin Salam as \\"Saint Tropez\\". In November 2012, the Greek singer Giorgos Tsalikis made a cover of Azis' song Hop, entitled Asto (Let it). == International acclaim == On 9 November 2011, a series of Azis' music videos were uploaded to Bilibili, a mainland Chinese video sharing website. The videos were numbered \\"av170001\\"(short for audio video) and have been popular, even one of the hottest videos on Bilibili since 2016. As of February 2020, the videos have been viewed over 21 million times and have received 788 thousand danmus (a special kind of comments) in all, and have been covered many times. Because of the wide spread of Hop, the first video of the series, Azis, known as \\"King of coquetry of Bulgaria (‰øùÂä†Âà©‰∫öÂ¶ñÁéã)\\", has become famous among some Chinese youths. == Discography  Studio albums === {class=\\"sortable \\" !Year!!Original title!!Transliteration !!

The River Spalding is not recorded, but would be the river now known as the River Foulness. The name may also be derived from the tribe known as the Spalda mentioned in the 7th century Tribal Hidage, which gave rise to the tribe or district known as the Spaldingas, the \\"dwellers by the Spald\\". If that explanation is correct, Spald could refer to some other fenland river or rivers. The Spaldingas also gave their name to the town of Spalding in Lincolnshire. Spaldington (Spellinton) was listed as being in the manor of Wressle (Weresa) in the Domesday Book of 1086. In around 1200 Eustace de Vesci and William Fitzpeter were joint lords of the manor; after de Vesci's death the manorship passed to Fitzpeter, then to his sister, to her eldest daughter who had married Peter dela Haye, then to the Vasavour's by the marriage of Isabella de la Haye to John Vavasour, father of John Vavasour died 1506. Spaldington Hall, an Elizabethan building was a seat of the Vavasour family. In 1838 the Hall was demolished. By 1850 'Hall farm' (or 'Old Hall farm') had been built on top of it.Ordnance Survey. 1855 (surveyed 1851-2) Sheet 223 A church or chapel dating to as early as 1650 was still extant in 1850, but had been demolished by 1890.Ordnance Survey. 1890. Sheet 223.5 A Wesleyan chapel, also used as school, was built in the village in 1820. By the 1830s the population (of the township) was 361. Spaldington mill, a corn mill on the Spaldington to Willitoft road was extant in 1850, but had been demolished by 1890 leaving the mill house; in the 20th century the mill house was removed, and the site levelled and field boundaries removed by the 1970s.Ordnance Survey 1854 (surveyed 1859-51) Sheet 222; 1890 Sheet 222.8; 1958 1:10560; 1972 1:2500; 1974‚Äì7 1:10000 The airship station RNAS Howden was built in the southern part of the parish in the early 20th century, opening in 1916, and closing in 1930.

Hall & Sons constructed a water tower for Howden Rural District Council at the A614 / Spaldington Lane junction. ===Wind farms=== In 2009, two planning applications were submitted for wind farms. Volkswind applied to build seven 2.3 MW turbines on Spaldington Common east of Spaldington; the application was refused in September 2010, the company appealed the decision, and the appeal was rejected in 2011. Falck Renewables and Coriolis Energy submitted an application for five 2.3 MW wind turbines, tip height with diameter blades, to be built west of the village on Spaldington Airfield; Spaldington parish council and a large number of residents objected to the scheme; the application was refused in September 2010, but allowed on appeal (under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) in 2011 (appeal reference APP/E2001/A/10/2137617). Falck Renewables expected construction to begin in 2013, with the wind farm operational by late 2014. In 2012 an application was submitted by RWE npower renewables for a third wind farm (River Valley Wind Farm) of six 2‚Äì3 MW wind turbines between Welham Bridge and Gribthorpe partly within the northern boundary of the parish. The application was refused in August 2013, and the developer submitted an appeal. ==References== * ==External links== Category:Villages in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in the East Riding of Yorkshire ","title":"Spaldington"},{"id":"9149746","text":"AASD may refer to: Schools: * Altoona Area School District, a public school district in Pennsylvania, United States * Appleton Area School District, a school district in Wisconsin, United States * Atlanta Area School for the Deaf, a school for the Deaf in Georgia, United States Other uses: * Applied Agile Software Development, a software development method ","title":"AASD"},{"id":"9149755","text":"Frizington is a village in Cumbria, England, historically part of Cumberland, near the Lake District National Park in England.

Piner Creek discharges to Santa Rosa Creek which in turn joins the Laguna de Santa Rosa.U.S. Geological Survey, Santa Rosa Quadrangle (1954, photorevised in 1980) The upper reaches in the foothills of the Mayacamas Mountains are at elevations of 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 meters), while the lower and middle reaches are located on the Santa Rosa Plain at elevations of between the 110- and 140-foot (33- and 43-meter) contours;U.S. Geological Survey, Aerial photograph stereo pair series (years 1957, 1965, and 1973) therefore, these lower reaches have a gradient of about 1:250 toward the southwest. Geologic studies in the lower and middle reaches of Piner Creek indicate groundwater levels ranging from three to 15 feet (one to 5 meters) below the surface.Environmental Site Assessment, 3230 and 3240 Coffey Lane, Santa Rosa, California Earth Metrics Incorporated, October 4, 1989 Prior to extensive urban development of the middle and lower reaches, the landscape earlier bore extensive agricultural uses including plum orchards, which fruit was subsequently processed for prunes. The Piner Creek watershed consists of , approximately three-fourths of which lies within the municipal boundaries of the city of Santa Rosa.Biological and Physical/Habitat Assessment in the Santa Rosa Watershed (2002) About one-third of the watershed is developed as residential use, and about one-sixth of the land is open space or used for recreation or agriculture. One of the early surviving architectural features of Sonoma County is within the Piner Creek catchment basin: A well preserved Round Barn, constructed in 1899, a testament to the 19th century pasturage uses within this watershed.History of Sonoma County, California ==Hydrology== Fountaingrove Lake, the origin of Piner Creek Piner Creek originates in the lower Mayacmas Mountains at Fountaingrove Lake. From its outlet at Fountaingrove Lake, Piner Creek flows down a relatively steep gradient, initially over a riprap lined channel, which has been modified in association with some alterations to lower Fountaingrove Lake. Thence Piner Creek flows northerly of an upscale modern office park before crossing under Redwood Highway and U.S. Highway 101. West of the U.S. 101 Freeway, Piner Creek winds through a retail and commercial/industrial area, before crossing under Piner Road near Coffey Lane; in this reach there is a large historic release to groundwater of solvent from manufacturing uses stemming back to the 1970s and 1980s. Water quality of Piner Creek is characterized by pH levels that are mildly basic, with upper reach pH levels about 8.5, declining to lower reach levels at 7.8 just above the discharge to Santa Rosa Creek.Water chemistry of the Laguna de Santa Rosa Watershed, Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca. (2007) The headwaters soils are typically of pH about 6.9. Water quality of Piner Creek is generally low in turbidity, except for highest flow periods resulting from heavy rains; the water is free from odor. Springtime water temperatures are typically in the range of 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 18 degrees Celsius). Piner Creek terminates at its confluence with Santa Rosa Creek, which watercourse discharges to the Laguna de Santa Rosa; the Laguna de Santa Rosa ultimately forms a confluence with the Russian River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. ==Geology== Piner Creek before its confluence with Santa Rosa Creek, on the Santa Rosa Plain As recently as the Miocene period, twelve million years ago, the entire watershed of Piner Creek was on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. After significant volcanic uplift and tectonic movement, the headwaters region of the Mayacmas Mountains emerged above the ocean. Piner Creek was one of the drainages that began to drain the new landmass, in formation of the eventual Santa Rosa Plain, through which the middle and lower reaches of Piner Creek flow. Occasional basaltic outcrops are seen in the upper reach of Piner Creek, betraying the volcanic origin of the Mayacmas Mountains.Volcanic Regions: Mayacamas and Sonoma Mountains The upper reach of Piner Creek watershed is characterized by presence of Goulding cobbly clay loam soil; this soil has slopes of up to 15 percent and is subject to moderate erosive potential.Soil Survey, Sonoma County, California, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Government Printing Office, Washington DC, May 1972 The actual soil depth is typically only about and may contain up to 25 percent cobblestones. Historic use of this soil has been for grazing. As the stream approaches the Santa Rosa Plain immediately east of U.S Highway 101, slopes diminish to a gradient of five to 15 percent and the predominant soil type is Felta very gravelly loam. This Felta soil is characterized by an upper surface grayish-brown color and texture of a fine, sticky and plastic nature. West of U.S. Highway 101, Piner Creek flows over the Santa Rosa Plain at gradients of less than two percent. Here the predominant soil type is Zamora silty clay loam, which has been deposited as an alluvial fan as the floodplain formed. The upper soil surface of the Zamora material is grayish- brown hard, firm, sticky and plastic. Permeability is moderately slow and fertility is high for these lower reach soils, which has resulted in historic orchard use and present day vineyards. ==Ecology== Formal habitat evaluation of Piner Creek has been conducted along with a number of other streams within the Laguna de Santa Rosa watershed. Habitat value of Piner Creek was found to be Fair compared to higher values scored by Matanzas Creek and Brush Creek and lower values scored by Colgan Creek. Most of the watercourse has been modified to accommodate urban development within Santa Rosa, and some alterations have been conducted to achieve higher levels of flood control. The dominant tree along the banks of Piner Creek is the coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia; within the streambed, a large number of cattail, Typha latifolia, stands are observed. A considerable number of bird species are found along the stream banks of Piner Creek. Based upon benthic macroinvertebrate sampling in Piner Creek, a low faunal diversity was found; moreover a declining trend of such biodiversity was noted over the period 2000 to 2003. In comparison with other streams of the Santa Rosa Creek watershed, Piner Creek was assessed to have above average epifaunal cover, riffle frequency and siltation characteristics. The high population level of tubificids in Piner Creek indicate the presence of excessive organic loading,E.B. Welch and T. Lindell, Ecological effects of wastewater, F P Spoon, London, England(2000) mostly due to high nitrate and phosphate runoff from urban uses (and possible reduced dissolved oxygen levels). ==See also== Historic Round Barn, built in 1899, located in the Piner Creek watershed *Flood control *Hiking *List of watercourses in the San Francisco Bay Area *Miwok == References == Category:Rivers of Sonoma County, California Category:Geography of Santa Rosa, California Category:Rivers of Northern California Category:Tributaries of the Russian River (California) ","title":"Piner Creek"},{"id":"9149911","text":"The plantar metatarsal veins run backward in the metatarsal spaces, collect blood from digital veins and communicate, by means of perforating veins, with the veins on the dorsum of the foot, and unite to form the deep plantar venous arch which lies alongside the plantar arterial arch. == References == Category:Veins of the lower limb ","title":"Plantar metatarsal veins"},{"id":"9149932","text":"Oak Grove High School is a combined American middle school and high school.

East of town, US 129 Alternate/SR 112/SR 257 head north, while SR 230 heads south and SR 27 head to the east. Almost immediately is an intersection with US 341/SR 26\\\\. Here, SR 26 joins the concurrency, while SR 27 departs to the east, running concurrent with US 341\\\\. US 129 Alternate/SR 26/SR 112/SR 257 head northeast for a short distance, until SR 257 leaves the concurrency to the northeast. It enters Bleckley County and passes through rural areas until it has a brief concurrency with US 23/SR 87 in Empire. During that concurrency, the three highways enter Dodge County. It continues to the northeast, until it enters Chester, where it has a short concurrency with SR 126\\\\. Upon leaving town, SR 257 enters Laurens County. In Dexter is another concurrency with SR 338\\\\. Just before entering Dublin, it has an interchange with I-16 and then intersects US 441 Bypass/SR 117\\\\. In town, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 319/US 441/SR 31. ==History== The portion of the highway in Laurens County was numbered as SR 277 until 1959. ===Interstate 175=== Interstate 175 (I-175) was a proposed auxiliary route of I-75. Most of the highway would have paralleled the current route of SR 300 (then numbered as SR 257). This highway would have connected the city of Albany to the Interstate Highway System via I-75, had it actually been built. I-175 and its unsigned State Route 412 were proposed in 1976 to travel east from the Liberty Expressway (US 19/US 82/SR 50) in Albany. It would then curve to the northeast, and travel on a routing that would have been located farther to the east than SR 257. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==ReferencesGeorgia Roads (Routes 241 - 260) 257 Category:Transportation in Crisp County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Dooly County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Wilcox County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Pulaski County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Bleckley County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Dodge County, Georgia Category:Transportation in Laurens County, Georgia ","title":"Georgia State Route 257"},{"id":"9149946","text":"United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), was a case regarding affirmative action in which the United States Supreme Court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not bar employers from favoring women and minorities.. The Court's decision reversed lower courts' rulings in favor of Brian Weber whose lawsuit beginning in 1974 challenged his employer's hiring practices. ==Facts== Brian Weber was 32 years old, and worked as a laboratory assistant at a chemical plant. His company, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp, had a policy of allowing whites and blacks into a training program on a one-to-one basis, even though there were many more whites than blacks. This came from a collective agreement with United Steelworkers of America. Weber did not get in. More training would have led to a pay raise. Weber claimed this violated Title VII. The company and the union argued it was pursuing affirmative action to remedy historical disadvantages among blacks. ==JudgmentLower courts=== Lower and federal courts supported Weber's claim that Title VII banned all forms of racial discrimination in employment whether against blacks or whites. ===Supreme Court=== By five to two the Supreme Court held that the affirmative action plan was lawful. The majority (Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall and Blackmun JJ) held that Title VII did not prohibit all kinds of affirmative action programs. They held that the plan of affirmative action must be transitional in nature and serve in fact to correct situations of imbalance by restoring equality at the starting point and should not set out to reproduce them artificially even when the effects of past discrimination have been wiped out. An affirmative action plan has to be (1) necessary (2) aiming to correct a statistical imbalance (3) not result in an absolute bar to hiring non- minorities (4) temporary, with an end date or goal (5) allow flexibility for hiring non-minorities. Chief Justice Burger, dissenting, said he might vote for it if he were a member of Congress but he was not, and Title VII explicitly prohibited that form of discrimination. Not having affirmative action was agreed to be the position when the Act was passed. He finished by quoting Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of Judicial Process (1921) 141, warning to beware of the 'good result' and judges exceeding their authority to get it. Justice Rehnquist dissented. He quoted George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-four (1949) 181, where in a sudden jump, mid sentence, the government declares war on Eastasia instead, without blinking, and said this was like the approach to interpretation of the majority: He cited two senators explaining precisely that the bill would not require a deliberate attempt to maintain a racial balance,because that would be recruiting on the basis of race, which would be unlawful. ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 443 * Griggs v.

They went through two name changes before debuting as \\"Lead\\" in May 2002 under the Pony Canyon sub-label Flight Master. The group consists of Shinya Taniuichi, Keita Furuya, Akira Kagimoto and, formerly, Hiroki Nakadoi. Upon debuting on July 31, 2002 with \\"Manatsu no Magic\\", the group experienced early success due to their dancing and vocal skills at a young age. The release of their second single \\"Show me the way\\" earned the group the Best Newcomer Award during the 44th Japan Record Awards. Their debut album Life On Da Beat took the #5 spot on the Oricon charts. In 2010, the group moved from Flight Master to the parent label of Pony Canyon with their single \\"Speed Star.\\" Beginning with the single \\"Wanna Be With You\\" (2012), the group began a string of top-charting singles. The single peaked at #3 on Orion and their singles for the following six years would continue to chart in the top five. Their album The Showcase (2016) became their highest- charting album at #2 and their following album Milestone (2018) became their longest-charting album, remaining on the charts for seven weeks. In 2013, leader and lead vocalist Nakadoi left the group after feelings of inadequacy. The last single he was featured in was \\"Still\\", and he officially left the group after their 2012 Upturn tour. In November 2019, he opened his own hair salon, heena. ==BiographyPre-debut and formation of Lead=== Hiroki Nakadoi, Shinya Taniuchi and Akira Kagimoto all attended the CALESS Vocal & Dance School („Ç≠„É£„É¨„Çπ„Éú„Éº„Ç´„É´&„ÉÄ„É≥„Çπ„Çπ„ÇØ„Éº„É´) in Osaka, Japan, where they met each other and became good friends. By March 2002, they began doing live street performances on the streets of Shiroten at Osaka Castle Park under the dance unit name of \\"Rhymix\\" („É™„Éü„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ). By May 2002, they renamed the group from \\"Rhymix\\" to \\"flow\\" and began performing by Kyobashi Station. After the name change, the three decided to recruit a fourth member. Meanwhile, on April 13, 2002, the Kyushu/Fukuoka Joint Starlight Audition (‰πùÂ∑û„ÉªÊ≤ñÁ∏ÑÂêàÂêå„Çπ„Çø„Éº„É©„Ç§„Éà„Ç™„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Ç∑„Éß„É≥) was being held in Okinawa by Rising Production on a search for new talent. At the time, Keita Furuya and another contestant, , were declared winners out of the 8,751 hopefuls that auditioned. flow tracked down Keita and he soon joined the group on May 18, 2002. On May 23, 2002, the group underwent another and final name change, officially becoming \\"Lead\\", whereas they had hoped to become a \\"leading group\\" of the age. ===2002‚Äì2007: Debut, Life On Da Beat and television roles=== Around early July 2002, Lead held their first live street performance as four-member group Lead at Osaka Castle Park to demonstrate their skills with dancing, singing and rapping. The event was deemed a success for the group with around 7,000 attendees. Lead also became the opening act for budding group w-inds for their first live tour - 1st Message - and performed in front of 120,000 people for each opening. Lead soon released their first single Manatsu no Magic on July 31, 2002. The release of their second single, \\"Show me the way\\" helped the group take the spot as Best Newcomer Award during the 44th Japan Record Awards, alongside the group day after tomorrow and soloists Mika Nakashima and Sachika Shino. In April the following year, they released their debut album, Life On Da Beat. It charted at #5 on the Oricon Albums Charts, giving the group more success in their early year. Their following single Fly Away also charted in the top ten at #10. Charting for seven weeks, it became, at the time, their longest-running single. Their debut album Life On Da Beat continued their success, securing the #5 spot on the charts. In 2003, the group performed the song \\"Get Wild Life.\\" The song would become the theme song for the 2004 film Kamachi, which all of the members would take part in, with Shinya being the titular character. The film was based on the life of Kamachi Yamada, a young savant who rebelled against the Japanese educational system. He created many works, which was come upon by his family after his untimely death in 1977. Lead was also featured in the 2003 film Boutaoshi! alongside fellow label-mates Flame and other Pony Canyon artists. The film was centered around the game bo- taoshi, or \\"pole-toppling\\", a popular sport in Japan. Shinya took on the lead role of Tsuguo Takayama, who was conned into joining the annual competition. In 2005, Hiroki played Taichi Kobayashi in the TV Tokyo series Pink no Idenshi. The series predominately followed the relationship of Taichi and Natsu Saito (Narumi Konno) throughout their time at Phoenix High School. ===2008‚Äì2011: Declining sales and annual singles=== By 2008, Lead had released a total of fourteen singles, five albums, seven DVDs and had performed five live tours. Along with making numerous guest appearances on talk shows, they had hosted their own TV shows, starred in several films and dramas, and had won a total of three Japan Record Awards. On July 30, 2008, Lead released their 15th single, \\"Sunnyday.\\" The single failed to break into the top 20 on the Oricon Singles Charts and became their lowest selling single, barely selling 3,000 copies. The single was followed by their first compilation album, Lead Tracks: Listener's Choice. The track list for the album consisted of songs between their 2002 debut with \\"Manatsu no Magic\\", up until \\"Sunnyday\\", which was released one week prior at the end of July. The songs for the album were voted on by fans throughout East Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. Songs with the highest vote were placed on the album. On August 5, 2009, they released their 16th single \\"GiraGira Romantic.\\" This marked the beginning of the group releasing one single a year for the next four years. This would also be their final single released under the Pony Canyon sub-label Flight Master, whereas the group would move to the main label. On July 28, 2010, their 17th single Speed Star was released. Their 18th single, Hurricane, was released on August 10, 2011. ===2012‚Äì2016: Hiroki's departure and increased popularity=== In 2012, the group began releasing two singles a year, along with the annual Upturn tours. Every single peaked in the top five on Oricon as the group's popularity and notoriety increased throughout the country. On March 14, 2012, the group released their highest-ranking, \\"Wanna Be With You\\", which peaked at #3 on Oricon. On December 12, 2012, their 20th single \\"Still\\" was released, peaking at #4. This became the first time since their debut to have two singles in a row to chart in the Top 5 on Oricon. This would also be the last single with group leader Hiroki. After Lead celebrated their tenth anniversary with the Leader's Party 10! concert for their fan club in March 2013, vocalist Hiroki Nakadoi stepped away from the group due to the belief that his bandmates had surpassed his abilities and he \\"shouldn't be with members who are aiming higher\\". Prior to Hiroki's final decision, the other members questioned if they should remain as a unit if Hiroki decided to leave. When Hiroki finalized his decision, with full support to the others as a group, they chose to stay together due to the constant support of their fans. Before retiring in the entertainment industry, Hiroki acquired a hairdresser's license and was active as a freelance hairdresser after retirement. On November 1, 2019, he opened up his own salon in Yoga, Setagaya called \\"heena\\". In 2013, they released the singles \\"Upturn\\" and \\"Green Days/Strings.\\" Both singles peaked in the top five at #5 and #4, respectively. They held their annual tour and released Lead Upturn 2013: Leap on DVD and Blu-ray in December. In 2014, the group released the single Sakura in February and became their fifth consecutive single to chart in the top five. In September, their single Omoide Breaker continued the string, debuting at #4. In 2015, they released \\"My One\\" and \\"Yakusoku.\\" While \\"My One\\" debuted at #3, it took #6 on the weekly ranking. Their seventh studio album, The Showcase, was released four years after their previous album, Now or Never, on June 8, 2016. The album's preceding singles were their highest charting singles since their debut in 2002, and the album became their highest charting album in their career, peaking at #2. The version of \\"Still\\" on the album was redone with only Shinya, Keita and Akira, omitting Hiroki's vocals. ===2017‚Äì2020: Milestone, Singularity and continued success=== A year-and-a- half after the release of their single Yakusoku, on March 8, 2017, the group released their twenty-seventh single, Tokyo Fever. It kept the group's streak of top-charting singles, charting at #5. The song was written by composer duo CLARABELL, who had been responsible for other top hits, including Avex artist Koda Kumi's song \\"Go to the Top\\", and E-girls songs \\"Gomennasai no Kissing You\\" and \\"Follow Me\\", among others. On August 23, they released Beautiful Day, which debuted at #4 before taking #6 on the charts. For the song, the group worked with Drew Ryan Scott and Sean Alexander. The coupling track, \\"Shampoo Bubble\\" was co-written by Japanese rapper KM-MARKIT, who was originally under the Pony Canyon label between 2005 and 2007 before creating Raider Music Record music label in 2010. On April 25, 2018, the group released Bumblebee, which became their highest debuting single at #2. The group released their eighth studio album on July 19, 2018, titled Milestone. The album became their longest charting album on Oricon, having stayed on the charts for seven weeks. On December 19, 2018, the group released their fifteenth tour DVD/Blu-ray, Lead Upturn 2018: Milestone. The DVD became their highest charting concert video, debuting at #17 on the Oricon DVD/Blu-ray charts. On January 30, 2019, the group released their thirtieth single Be the Naked, which peaked at #6 on the Oricon Daily Singles Charts. They released their thirty-first single, Summer Vacation, on July 24, 2019. They held several live events to help promote the single, with certain lives offering an After Party, which were only available to fan club members. The single debuted at #6 on the charts, continuing their streak of top 10 singles. It was followed by Hide and Seek/Sunset Refrain, which charted at No. 3. Despite being a double a-side, only the music video for \\"Sunset Refrain\\" was on the DVD. The music video for \\"Hide and Seek\\" was released on their ninth studio album, Singularity, which was released a month later on March 18, 2020. Singularity debuted at No. 12 on Oricon, becoming their first album in twelve years to not debut in the top ten. ===2020-present: Response to COVID-19, remix album and singles=== Beginning in April 2020, Lead became recurring guests on Tokyo MX to take part in Japan's \\"stay at home\\" order due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was to bring entertainment to the country's residents. On May 6, they released their first solo remix album, Joy Joy Home Mix. The album was released digitally as a continuing factor in Lead's participation. On September 23, 2020, Lead released their first single post-Singularity, titled Tuxedo. It continued their release of top ten singles, debuting at No. 5 on Oricon. The music video for it was choreographed by label-mate Tomohiro Taniguchi of DA PUMP, who had created the choreography for their own summer hit \\"U.S.A.\\" It was used as the ending theme song to the TBS show Hiruobi! beginning on the first of the month. They released two more videos to correspond with the single: a choreography version of \\"Tuxedo\\" and a video for \\"Kangoku Rokku\\" (a cover of Elvis Presley's 1957 \\"Jailhouse Rock\\"), the latter of which premiered on the streaming site YouTube the day before the single's release on September 22. ==MembersCurrent members=== * * * ===Former member=== * -- left on March 31, 2013 ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *2003: Life On Da Beat *2004: Brand New Era *2005: Lead!

Although this was not Williams' screen debut, it was her first Technicolor musical. The film was initially to be titled \\"Mr. Co-Ed\\", with Red Skelton having top billing. However, once MGM executives watched the first cut of the film, they realized that Esther Williams' role should be showcased more, and changed the title to \\"Bathing Beauty\\", giving her prominent billing and featuring her bathing-suit clad figure on the posters.The Million Dollar Mermaid: An Autobiography, By Esther Williams, Digby Diehl, Published by Harcourt Trade, 2000, , The film is also Janis Paige's film debut. After this film, Paige would go to Warner Brothers to make such films as Of Human Bondage, Hollywood Canteen, and Romance on the High Seas. In later years, Paige would return to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in few films. ==Plot== In Los Angeles, popular songwriter Steve Elliott (Red Skelton) prepares to marry Caroline Brooks (Esther Williams), who has pledged to give up her job as a college swimming instructor once she has wed. Likewise, Steve plans to quit his songwriting career, even though New York producer George Adams (Basil Rathbone) has already hired him to write new songs for a water ballet show. When George overhears Steve discussing his \\"retirement\\" with Caroline, he vows to prevent the marriage and enlists Maria Dorango (Jacqueline Dalya), an aspiring actress posing as a Latin-American singer, to help him. Moments after a justice of the peace pronounces the redheaded Steve and Caroline man and wife, Maria rushes in, claiming that Steve is her husband and the father of her three redheaded children, which she has paraded in at that moment. Although Steve pleads his innocence, Caroline storms off in a rage and returns to her teaching post at Victoria College in New Jersey. A determined Steve and his friend, Carlos Ramirez, follow her there, but are denied entrance to the all-female school. Later, in a New York nightclub, Steve meets drunken lawyer Chester Klazenfrantz (Donald Meek), and learns that Klazenfrantz has been hired to change the charter of Victoria College, which has never officially designated itself as all-female. Armed with this information, Steve returns to Victoria and insists on applying for admission. Unaware of Caroline's relationship to Steve, Dean Clinton (Nana Bryant) suggests to the faculty that he be admitted for a two-week probationary period, during which time they would give him 100 demerits, which would qualify him for expulsion before Parents Day. Once enrolled, Steve tries to speak with Caroline, but she refuses to listen to his explanations and tells him she is seeking an annulment. Later, in music class, stodgy Professor Hendricks (Francis Pierlot) attempts to discredit Steve, whose presence on campus has created a furor among the co-eds, by ordering him to write his own version of the Scottish ballad Loch Lomond and teach the next day's class. With help from several talented students, Carlos, the music teaching assistant (Ethel Smith), and Steve's friend Harry James and his orchestra, Steve meets Hendricks' challenge and is awarded an \\"A\\". That night, Steve visits Caroline at her house, but is turned out after Willis Evans (Bill Goodwin), a conservative botany professor who is in love with Caroline, arrives. When Caroline realizes that Steve is hiding in her closet, spying on her, she commands Willis' Great Dane, Duke, to guard the closet door, while reminding Steve that unless he is in his room in five minutes, he will be expelled for breaking curfew. With only seconds to spare, Steve manages to trick the dog long enough to escape back to his dingy basement room. Steve is then visited by George, who threatens to vilify him in the press unless he finishes his songs. When Steve swears deadly revenge on the person who hired Maria, however, George backs down and offers to help Steve do his homework. Concerned about the approaching Parents Day, Dean Clinton, meanwhile, commands Steve's professors, who have penalized him with only fifty-five demerits, to bear down on him. To that end, Mme. Zarka (Ann Codee), Steve's ruthlessly strict ballet teacher, forces him to wear a tutu and dance with the co-eds, but Steve once again rises to the occasion. A now desperate Dean Clinton asks Caroline to go out with Steve and ensure that he arrives back at Victoria after the curfew. Caroline agrees, but during the evening, Steve convinces her of his innocence, and as they drive back to school, the newlyweds make plans to return to California together. Unknown to Caroline and Steve, Maria is on campus, looking to expose George, who has been trying to get rid of her, to Steve. At the same time, a campus sorority descends on Steve's room, hoping to initiate him, and Jean Allenwood (Jean Porter), another co-ed, shows up with news that her parents and Dean Clinton are on their way over to inspect his room. As Steve desperately hides all the women in two closets and keeps Caroline from discovering Maria, George unexpectedly arrives. Although Steve succeeds in hiding George and himself and fooling Dean Clinton and the Allenwoods, Maria soon makes her presence known to Caroline, who once again leaves in a fury. Later, Steve promises to write songs for George's water ballet show on condition he make Caroline the star. George agrees, and after Maria is finally able to tell Caroline the truth, Caroline happily reunites with Steve, who then gives George a thrashing. ==Cast== * Red Skelton as Steve Elliot * Esther Williams as Caroline Brooks * Basil Rathbone as George Adams * Bill Goodwin as Professor Willis Evans * Jean Porter as Jean Allenwood * Nana Bryant as Dean Clinton * Carlos Ram√≠rez as Himself * Ethel Smith as Ethel Smith - Music Teacher * Lina Romay as Herself * Helen Forrest as Herself - Singer with Harry James and His Music Makers * Donald Meek as Chester Klazenfrantz * Jacqueline Dalya as Maria Dorango * Francis Pierlot as Professor Hendricks * Ann Codee as Mme.

He protested and after conferencing with his wife, only cut the hair once the studio paid him $200 in cash and saved all of the curls in a plastic bag. Another scene with Skelton proved difficult to complete with his character trapped in a house with a large aggressive dog outside. The scene was due to be scrapped until Buster Keaton visited the set and quickly suggested a satisfactory resolution. The pool sequences were shot on location at the Lakeside Country Club in San Fernando Valley. The film was shot during January and the grass on the rolling country club lawns was dead and brown. Director George Sidney brought in a paint crew and had the dead grass spray painted green, which lasted the entire week of shooting. However, that ruined the grass, and the studio had to send in crews in the spring to re-seed the lawn. Williams' date to the first preview of the film in Pomona was her future husband Sergeant Ben Gage. ==Release== The film premiered at the Astor Theater in New York. For the event, MGM publicity set up a six story-tall billboard of Williams diving into Times Square with a large sign that said \\"Come on in. The water's fine!\\" ===Critial response=== Response for the film was \\"glowing\\", as Williams wrote in her autobiography. A 1944 review from the New York Times scoffed at the title, but also wrote: \\"Miss Williams' talents as a swimmer‚Äînot to mention her other attributes‚Äîmake any title the studio wants to put on it okay by us. When she eels through the crystal blue water in a rosy-red bathing suit or splashes in limpid magnificence in the gaudy water carnival which John Murray Anderson has brought to pass, she's a bathing beauty for our money, even though dragged in by the heels. In other words, \\"Bathing Beauty\\" is a colorful shower of music, comedy, and dance. As July pants hotly on June's heels, it is a pleasant refreshment to have at hand.\\" ===Box office=== With the film's wonderful tunes and extravagant water sequences, Bathing Beauty was a smash at the box office. According to MGM records, the movie earned $3,284,000 in the US and Canada, and $3,608,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,132,000. It was one of the most popular movies of 1946 in France with admissions of 5,438,665.French box office of 1946 at Box Office Story ===Home media=== Esther Williams emerges from the water during the finale. On July 17, 2007, Turner Entertainment released Bathing Beauty on DVD as part of the Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 1. The 5 disc set contained digitally remastered versions of several of Williams' films, including Easy to Wed (1946), On an Island with You (1948), Neptune's Daughter (1949), and Dangerous When Wet (1953) ===Influence=== Several moments from the film became famous, one such scene in which swimmers dive past one another into the pool and water stunts involving Williams, including her being received as a queen emerging from the water, her high swan dive, and her being surrounded by several other swimmers who form a circle. The overhead shots of these elaborate choreographed sequences became iconic, especially for Williams and choreographer Busby Berkeley.

His career was interrupted from 1943 through 1945 by United States Navy service in the Pacific theatre of World War II.Baseball in Wartime Schmitz batted right-handed but threw left-handed. His nickname, \\"Bear Tracks\\", was inspired by the way he shuffled to the mound and his size 14 feet. Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, he was listed as tall and . ==Career== Originally signed by the Cleveland Indians in 1938, Schmitz was obtained by the Chicago Cubs from the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association as part of a minor league working agreement. He made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 6, 1941, at the age of 20. He was the fourth-youngest player that year. In his debut, he threw only one pitch. Schmitz pitched marvelously in the short stint that would be his first major league season: in five games‚Äîincluding three starts‚Äîhe went 2‚Äì0 with a 1.31 earned run average, and one complete game. That season was a foreshadowing of the success he would witness in the next few years of his career. In 1942, Schmitz posted a solid 3.43 ERA despite a mediocre 3‚Äì7 record with the Cubs (who as a team went 68‚Äì86 that year). He would end up missing the next three years due to military service, but in 1946 he came back better than ever. An All-Star that year, he posted a 2.61 ERA in 41 games, 31 started. He went 11‚Äì11, with 135 strikeouts in 224+ innings pitched, allowing just six home runs in that time. He led the league in strikeouts and was second in hits allowed per nine innings that year (he allowing just 7.38H/9IP). He was fourth in the league in games started, fifth in innings, sixth in ERA and complete games (14) and seventh in game appearances. This performance put him at 30th place in MVP voting that year. Schmitz' 1947 season was fairly disappointing‚Äîhe posted a record of 13‚Äì18, leading the league in walks. His 3.22 ERA was still good for 10th in the league, as were his 97 strikeouts. His four saves were ninth in the league, and his three shutouts were sixth. In 1948, Schmitz went 18‚Äì13 with a 2.64 ERA. He made the All-Star game for the second time of his career. He was 12th overall in MVP voting, third in the league in wins and complete games (18), fifth in ERA and sixth in games started (30). He also led the league in hits allowed per nine innings, giving up an average of only 6.92. Schmitz' next two and a half seasons with the Cubs were less than stellar. In that time, he went a combined 23‚Äì35, posting a cumulative ERA of 4.80. Still, he finished 23rd in MVP voting in 1949. It was this subpar performance that prompted a trade by the Cubs to the Brooklyn Dodgers (a team he'd won 18 games against) on June 15, 1951. Schmitz was sent from the Cubs along with Andy Pafko, Wayne Terwilliger and Rube Walker, to the Dodgers for Bruce Edwards, Joe Hatten, Eddie Miksis and Gene Hermanski. Schmitz never played a full season with the Dodgers. In parts of the 1951 and 1952, Schmitz went 2‚Äì5 with a 4.96 ERA in 26 games, 10 of them started. On August 1, 1952, he was selected off waivers from the Dodgers by the New York Yankees. He ended up posting a 3.60 ERA in five games with them before being traded with Jim Greengrass, Bob Marquis and Ernie Nevel to the Cincinnati Reds for Ewell Blackwell. He gave up no runs in five innings of work (in three games total) for the Reds that year. Shoulder and arm problems would result in him playing less and less. In the 1952/1953 offseason, Schmitz was purchased by the Yankees. He only appeared in three regular season games in 1953 with them before being picked up by the Washington Senators off waivers on May 12. His time with them in 1953 was quite similar to the last few seasons-he posted a 2‚Äì7 record. 1954 was quite a career revitalization for Schmitz. In 29 games, 23 of them started, he posted an 11‚Äì8 record to complement a 2.91 ERA, which was ninth best in the league. That success did not carry over to 1955, though. He went 7‚Äì10 that year with a 3.71 ERA. In the 1955 offseason, Schmitz was traded by the Senators with Bob Porterfield, Tom Umphlett and Mickey Vernon to the Boston Red Sox for Karl Olson, Dick Brodowski, Tex Clevenger, Neil Chrisley and Al Curtis, a minor leaguer. He ended up appearing in only two games with the Red Sox in 1956 before being purchased by the Baltimore Orioles. He ended his career with them, playing his final game on September 7. He was released by the Orioles on October 18, 1956. Overall, he went 93‚Äì114 in his career, posting an ERA of 3.55. He walked 757 batters and struck out 746. He was a poor hitter overall with a .141 career batting average, although he did hit two home runs. As a fielder, he committed 23 errors for a .963 fielding percentage. He was involved in 43 double plays in his career. Until his death Schmitz lived in Wausau, Wisconsin, and was greens keeper at the American Legion golf club Wausau. ==Military service== Schmitz missed the end of the 1942 baseball season when he entered the navy. His work as a specialist 3rd class took him to the Pacific Theatre. He was able to play baseball for military teams prior to his deployment. ==Other information== *Schmitz wore number 7 in 1941 (one of the rare times in history a pitcher wore a single digit number), 23 in 1942, 53 from 1946 to 1950, 53 and 19 in 1951, 19, 45, and 40 in 1952, 35 and 31 in 1953, 31 in 1954, 20 in 1954 and 1955 and 21 and 40 in 1956. *It has been determined that Schmitz earned $21,000 in 1949. *Quote: \\"Three inches in front of home plate it (Johnny Schmitz's curve ball) was up around your head; the catcher wound up catching it by your feet.

The technique involves cutting the long wire into one or more short wires and inserting a repeater between each new pair of short wires. The time it takes for a signal to travel from one end of a wire to the other end is known as wire-line delay or just delay. In an integrated circuit, this delay is characterized by RC, the resistance of the wire (R) multiplied by the wire's capacitance (C). Thus, if the wire's resistance is 100 ohms and its capacitance is 0.01 microfarad (ŒºF), the wire's delay is one microsecond (¬µs). To first order, the resistance of a wire on an integrated circuit is directly proportional, or linear, according to the wire's length. If a 1 mm length of the wire has 100 ohms resistance, then a 2 mm length will have 200 ohms resistance. For the purposes of our highly simplified discussion, the capacitance of a wire also increases linearly along its length. If a 1 mm length of the wire has 0.01 ¬µF capacitance, a 2 mm length of the wire will have 0.02 ¬µF, a 3 mm wire will have 0.03 ¬µF, and so on. Thus, the time delay through a wire increases with the square of the wire's length. This is true, to first order, for any wire whose cross-section remains constant along the length of the wire. wire resistance capacitance time delay length R C t 1 mm 100 ohm 0.01 ¬µF 1 ¬µs 2 mm 200 ohm 0.02 ¬µF 4 ¬µs 3 mm 300 ohm 0.03 ¬µF 9 ¬µs The interesting consequence of this behavior is that, while a single 2 mm length of wire has a delay of 4 ¬µs, two separate 1 mm wires only have a delay of 1 ¬µs each. The two separate wires cover the same distance in half the time! By cutting the wire in half, we can double its speed. To make this magic trick work properly, an active circuit must be placed between the two separate wires so as to move the signal from one to the next. An active circuit used for such a purpose is known as a repeater. In a CMOS integrated circuit, the repeater is often a simple inverter. Reducing the delay of a wire by cutting it in half and inserting a repeater is known as repeater insertion. The cost of this procedure is the additional new delay through the repeater itself, plus power cost because the repeater is an active circuit that must be powered, whereas the plain unrepeated wire was originally an unpowered passive component. For more details, see for example Anikreddy and Burleson's paper, Repeater Insertion in deep sub-micron CMOS: Ramp-based Analytical Model and Placement Sensitivity Analysis, in ISCAS 2000, the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, May 28‚Äì31, 2000, Geneva, Switzerland (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/6910/18588/00856173.pdf).

He led the Conservative group on the authority from 2003 to 2008. ==Early life and career== Welsh was educated at the independent school Dover College and at Lincoln College, Oxford. He joined the clothing company Levi Strauss & Co., and became their director of market development in 1976. ==European Parliament== At the 1979 European Parliament elections, Welsh fought and won the Lancashire Central seat for the Conservative Party. This constituency included Blackpool and Preston. He made a specialism in the textile industry which was a major employer in Lancashire. In 1981 he acted as rapporteur for the committee on External Economic Arrangements on the renewal of the Multi Fibre Agreement, and argued that the agreement should be extended for ten years, during which export levels should be fixed; he urged nations developing their textile industries not to force the EEC to put in protectionist measures. Later in the 1980s Welsh wrote a series of pamphlets concerning labour market policy, the European Community's role in collective security, the effects of German reunification on Europe, and on accountability of European institutions to the United Kingdom Parliament. He was narrowly re-elected at the 1989 election, when the Labour Party performed well. ==Defeat== In the 1994 election, Welsh lost his seat to the Labour candidate Mark Hendrick. He was given another appointment by the Conservative government of the day as Chairman of Chorley and District NHS Trust, and set up the Action Centre for Europe Ltd, a pro-European Union thinktank for Conservatives. Welsh supported the United Kingdom adopting the Euro as its currency, and was an active participant in the Conservatives' intra-party debate on European policy in the 1990s. ==Lancashire County Council== Welsh was elected to Lancashire County Council in 1997 from Preston North East Ward. He became Leader of the Conservative group in 2003. He has supported retaining a two-tier approach to local government rather than allowing larger councils to become unitary authorities.

Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games) are field games played by two opposing teams, in which the action starts when the defending team throws a ball at a dedicated player of the attacking team, who tries to hit it with a bat.In some games for a small number of players, such as workup and the way old cat games, there are no teams and players rotate through the positions. The best known modern bat-and-ball games are baseball and cricket, with common roots in the 18th-century games played in England. The teams alternate between \\"batting\\" (offensive) role, sometimes called \\"in at bat\\" or simply in, and \\"fielding\\" (defensive role), also called \\"out in the field\\" or out.Note that the terms \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" can have several other important meanings in various bat-and-ball sports; for an example of wordplay involving this in cricket that demonstrates the ambiguity inherent to the terms, see https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/page/429550.html. Only the batting team may score, but teams have equal opportunities in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed. The action starts when a player on the fielding team puts the ball in play with a delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a \\"bat\\", which is a club governed by the rules of the game. After striking the ball, the batter may become a runner trying to reach a safe haven or \\"base\\". While in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the batting team out, which varies by game. In modern baseball, the fielders put three players out. In cricket, they retire all players but one. In many forms of early American baseball (townball, roundball), a single out ended the inning. Some games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement between those \\"safe havens\\" is governed by the rules of the particular sport, and runs (points) may be scored when the batting team's players go from one safe haven to another. == Common features == This list may not apply to all bat-and-ball games, but covers certain features common to many of them: * Safe haven rules: ** Only one player can be protected by a given safe haven (i.e. both batters can't stay in the same crease in cricket to avoid a runout). *** Schlagball and Lapta (game) allow multiple runners at a safe haven. ** The number of safe havens may range from 2 to 4. * How to score runs: ** How runs are scored by running: *** In cricket, two partners occupy 2 opposing safe havens known as each partner's ground, and can swap safe havens to score one run. More swaps can be made to score more runs. *** In Schlagball, a runner must make it from one of the safe havens to the other, and back, to score one run. *** In various baseball-like games, a runner must complete a full trip around all of the bases to score a run. ** Alternative ways to score runs: *** A ball that is hit very far (such as to the edge of, or out of the field) through the air (such as a home run or six (cricket)), or potentially in a specific area or place, such as in Bat-and-Trap, may automatically give the batting team some points, or at least the chance of earning points. https://protoball.org/Modern_rules_of_Schlagball \\"Long hit point If a player hits the ball over the pitch into the long-hitting field, thus over 70 meters, the batting team is given a long hit point.\\" * Ways for a batter to get out: ** When a batter hits a ball in the air that is caught by a fielder without bouncing, the fielding team gets closer to getting the batting team out, or otherwise receives an advantage. *** In baseball and cricket, catches get the batter out. **** In early forms of baseball, the ball could bounce once before being caught.https://www.mlb.com/cut4/10-bizarre-rules-from-baseballs- past/c-124363454 \\"2. Fly balls could be caught off a bounce until 1864, and foul balls until 1883\\" The \\"one hand, one bounce\\" rule of street cricket is similar. *** In Schlagball, a one-handed catch taken \\"without bobbling\\" earns the fielding team a point. https://protoball.org/Modern_rules_of_Schlagball \\"Catch point If the batted ball caught by a player of the fielding team directly from the air, with one hand and without bobbling [Nachgreifen], the field team receives a catch point. Catch points also may be earned off invalid hits of the batting side by catching the ball.\\" *** A fielder must remain within the field of play for the catch to be valid. ** The batter may have a \\"strike zone\\" or area within which they are obliged to hit or deflect the ball if it is thrown there, lest they be put out. (In baseball, 3 unhit balls in the strike zone get a batter out, while one ball hitting a batter's wicket gets them out in cricket). * Penalties are rewarded to the batting team if the ball isn't thrown \\"fairly\\" to the batter (i.e. isn't thrown from far away enough, or is thrown too far from the batter's hitting zone) ** See wide (cricket) and ball (baseball statistics). * Strategy: ** Batters have some latitude in terms of how far or when to run when scoring points (i.e. a baseball batter may stop at 1st base or continue to 2nd if they desire, though their choice also depends on whether there is a runner at 2nd or 3rd; see Base_running#Strategy), and this creates a risk-reward decision that could result in either more points or more outs. *** Generally, the further the ball is hit from the fielders, the more time this affords for running. ** There may be decisions on where to place fielders (see Infield shift) in anticipation of where a batter may hit the ball, or decisions on how and who best to deliver the ball to the batter so as to prevent them from hitting it and scoring (see Bowling_(cricket)#Bowling_tactics). * There may be certain places where the batter is not allowed or penalized for hitting the ball to. See foul ball. * The ball may be thrown through the air to the batter, or it might bounce on the ground before reaching them. (See bowling (cricket)) * How batters alternate the batting: ** In cricket, the two safe havens are occupied at all times by one player each from the batting team. The ball is delivered to the player standing in one of the safe havens, with the two players being a batting pair that face all deliveries for their team until one of them is dismissed, at which point another player from the batting team comes to occupy the now-unoccupied safe haven. *** The batting order (cricket) is not fixed, and a player may not be on a safe haven if they were out earlier in the inning. ** In baseball and other sports, every time the batter runs to a new safe haven, another batter comes in to bat. *** These games tend to have a fixed batting order, and players can bat several times in an inning. === Field === The safe havens of a cricket field (left) and baseball field (right) are depicted in green. In cricket and baseball, the playing field is large, and is divided into an infield and outfield (based on proximity to where the batters are running). Cricket has the delivery and hitting of the ball done in the same area where the batters can run (the cricket pitch), while baseball always does the running in a separate area. Many bat-and-ball games have playing area in front of the batter (such as Schlagball), but may (like baseball) restrict batters from hitting the ball behind themselves or too far to the side; see foul territory. === Game length === T20 cricket and baseball both last about 3 hours, while other forms of cricket can last multiple days. Informal bat-and- ball games may take place in shorter periods of time, and in general, the possibility of a team's batters getting out rapidly in succession makes it theoretically possible for certain periods of play in most bat-and-ball games to end quicker than usual. * The game may be played for a certain number of innings. ** There can potentially be time restrictions (as in Test cricket), or the possibility of a game being suspended and resumed at a later date if necessary.. ** The team with fewer runs may have to bat more innings than the other team (see Follow on). * There may be no restriction on the number of innings or time.  Result  Bat-and-ball games are played until: * In baseball and Test cricket, the team with fewer runs must complete all of its scheduled innings for there to be a winner, with the end of the inning occurring when the team has a certain number of outs. ** Test cricket also has the potential of a draw, which is where time runs out before the team that is behind on runs completes its innings. ** In limited overs cricket, an inning can also be completed when a team has faced a certain number of (legal) deliveries to score off of. * In bete-ombro and early forms of baseball, a game can be played until either team scores a certain number of runs. Ties can be dealt with in several ways: * The tie may simply be considered a tie. * Both teams may get additional deliveries to try to score off of, to break the tie. ** Cricket has a Super Over of 6 additional deliveries. ** Baseball has extra innings. === Terminology === Here are some terms or concepts common to many bat-and-ball games: * The person who delivers the ball to the batter: the bowler (cricket), pitcher * Getting the batter out by throwing the ball at something near the batter, when the batter doesn't hit the ball: strike out, Bowled#Dismissal_of_a_batsman * The act of getting the batter or runner out when they are not in a safe haven: ** If the ball is thrown at the runner: plugging, soaking ** If a fielder touches the runner with ball in hand: tagout ** If a fielder gets the ball to the safe haven before the runner does: force out, runout * getting a batter out by catching the ball when hit in the air by the batter: fly out, caught out * The points both teams score: runs * The safe havens: base (baseball), ground (cricket), crease (cricket) * A ball hit out of the field of play through the air: home run, six (cricket) ===Equipment=== * Bat: generally resembles the round shape of a baseball bat or the flat shape of the larger cricket bat . Other designs include something similar to a hockey stick. * Ball: Often about as large as a cricket ball * Protective equipment for the batter and/or fielders, ranging from helmets to gloves. In the field, there may be: * Physical markers for the safe havens (such as bases, wickets, and lines like the crease (cricket)) * Physical markers for the \\"strike zone\\" near the batter (see the target in Vitilla) * A physical boundary for the field (see the fence in baseball) ==List of bat-and-ball games== Notable bat-and-ball games include: ===Mainstream sports=== * Baseball ‚Äì has four bases ** Softball * Cricket ‚Äì has two wickets ** Test cricket ** First-class cricket ** Blind cricket ** Club cricket ** French cricket ** Kilikiti ** One Day International ** Kwik cricket ** List-A cricket ** Pro40 ** Indoor Cricket ** Limited-overs cricket ** Short form cricket ** Single wicket ** Twenty20 ** T10 League ===Other games=== * Bat-and-Trap * Gilli Danda * Oina * Old Cat (One old cat, Two old cat, etc.) ‚Äì variable * P√§rk * Stoolball Similar to baseball * Blooperball ‚Äì Softball with a squishy, 16-inch ball * British Baseball ‚Äì four posts * Br√§nnboll ‚Äì four bases * Corkball ‚Äì four bases (no base-running) * Elle * Extreme Baseball a.k.a.

The objective is one batter (striking batter) on and at the right batter's box is pitched to, other batter (non-striking batter) stands on the left batter's box, then the striking batter must hit it and batter must runs around the bases in the normal counterclockwise direction, while the non-striking batter runs around bases in a clockwise direction at the same time. The game could last 12 innings of 5 overs. Non-bat-and-ball games Striking the ball with a \\"bat\\" or any type of stick is not crucial. These games use the foot or hand. Otherwise their rules may be similar or even identical to baseball. The first two use a large (35 cm) soft ball. * Kickball - four bases, sometimes called soccer baseball ** Matball - kickball with gym mats for bases * Punchball - four bases, sometimes called volleyball-style baseball or slug ==References== ==See also== *Comparison of baseball and cricket, the two largest bat-and-ball sports ==External links== * Project Protoball * Johnball * Best Youth Baseball Bat 2016 Category:Ball games ","title":"Bat-and-ball games"},{"id":"9150247","text":"State Route 254 (SR 254) is a southwest-northeast state highway located in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Georgia.

He is the main character starring in the series Powers. He was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Avon Oeming. The series was originally published through Image Comics beginning in 2000, but in 2004, it moved to Marvel Comics, where the series launched Marvel's Icon Comics division for creator-owned titles. ==Fictional character biography== Christian Walker's origin was explored in the story arc \\"Forever\\" in Powers (vol. 1), issues 31 to 37. Initially thought of as a boring, two dimensional character due to his lack of conversation (which has since been put down to a feeling of having had \\"every discussion before\\" like an \\"old man that couldn't be bothered to finish his sentences\\" in the letters pages of the book) the origin was acclaimed for its originality and filled out some questions surrounding Walker, while further raising some more. It all started at the dawn of man, when two pre-human hominids have a disagreement over a female and start fighting, both surprised and confused to find that they have powers. The fight rages on for days and destroys everything in its path as the first super powered battle, eventually tiring them out. They walk away from each other in a stalemate. One of these first ape-men was Christian Walker. In the Powers 2008 Annual, it is revealed that Walker and his rival clashed, this time as full Homo sapiens cave-dwellers. Walker, now known as Gor, has retired to a desolate cave where he sat alone for many years, simply metamorphosing to 'higher' forms of hominids (Evolution describes how species separate, not changes in individual life forms). Over time, Gor attracts a tribe, and becomes something like a worshipped chief to his people. When one of Gor's men is killed by a wound not made by teeth or claw, Gor is forced to investigate, following a trail that leads to his old rival. Gor's rival, now calling himself Blood Fist, has invented the world's first stone weapon (a knife made of rock and bone, suggesting he has a tendency to out-pace Walker in evolution) and has used it to violently take over a tribe. Now Blood Fist is preparing to challenge the tribe's \\"cave god\\", an enormous bear to which the tribe pays tribute, and claims to be a god himself. Remembering the two's past encounter Gor resolves to end their fight once and for all, and moves quickly into the cave, killing the bear with his bare hands and ripping off its skin. Gor challenges Blood Fist while wearing the bear skin, rejecting his words and claiming that they are both just men. Finally, Gor apparently ends their fight by stealing Blood Fist's weapon and stabbing him through the skull. Next the story shifts in time thousands of years, following a famous warrior named Gora (as Christian Walker is called here) as he is tracked down by a Princess warrior to fight for her father. His vicious powered enemy Haemon (who was the other early human that he fought before) appears, claims they are demons on earth, slays the Princess warrior and starts another momentous battle. Walking away in exhaustion, Haemon tells Gora to be ready for their next fight. Shift forward thousands of years more and we see Christian Walker walking up thousands of steps to the Woshu Mountain Temple in Peking, China to see Master Han Xian-Zi, leader of masters and warriors who live and study in the Great Temple. It is this great journey of walking up the steps to the Temple, making his feet \\"calloused and dead\\" that gives him the name 'Walker'. He hopes of discovering what makes him so different. He finds dozens similar to him, some immortal, mortal, or reincarnated, but all special and looking for a home. Walker is portrayed as tortured by the deaths of loved ones and not only confused by, but unwanting of the powers he holds. It is discovered that like many Powers, but not all of them, Detective Christian Walker, despite being as old as recorded time, can only remember as far back as a human mind can. He has his first meeting with Zora and the then Chinese version of Retro-Girl, and Supershock, who all would later play a big part in his life. It appears he likes Retro-Girl and most likely sparks up a relationship with her, much to Zora's disappointment. He lived there in peace for 16 years until an ordinary man travelled to the Temple from Peking to ask for help against the invading, deceptive foreigners who had taken many Peking people as slaves and had set off a chain reaction of violence and destruction in his city. The warriors within the Temple are split as whether to help these people so different from them, but Walker, along with Zora, Retro-Girl, Supershock and others decide to help, forming the first known super team. In homage to golden age superheroes first known as \\"Mystery Men\\", the story shifts to 1936 Chicago, where Walker had recently put on a mask to help his wife's brother out against Frank Nitti and the mob. Tracking down Einstein, he hopes to figure out how he does what he does, including an ability to fly. It is revealed parts of his memory do come back to him, but yet he has no idea why he left China or what happened to him in intervening years that include London. Einstein, of course, has no idea of the answers Walker needs and is shocked at his power. Einstein gives Walker one piece of classic superhero advice however. \\"Never let them know who you really are -- never take the mask off. They'll kill you.\\" Walker travels home to tell his wife that he felt better for the talk, to find his aging wife had been butchered by the man formerly known as Haemon. Clearly having a better memory than Walker, he had tracked him down to fight him once again, as he reveals he has done in many countries, in many eras. Shocked and angry that Walker does not have the same memories of him, Haemon (in this century, later calling himself Wolfe) beats him and leaves, expressing how he wanted to kill Walker when he could remember him and feed off of his hate. Switching to 1986 and the final chapter of Walker's origin of how he came to be, he is first shown in bed with Zora and Retro-Girl (modern) before being shown with them in costume as Diamond, \\"the costumed avenger that captured the hearts and minds of a generation\\". Triphammer (a great playboy inventor who uses his expertise to design suits that give him Powers, much like Iron Man) showed Walker the first Power Drainer, and its distinctive green glow. Walker expresses an interest in making such a power drain permanent to the disgust of Triphammer. Snapping, Diamond/Walker again expresses his anguish at watching his loved ones die time after time. Then their \\"family\\" of superheroes including himself, Zora, Retro-Girl and Triphammer confront the greatest villains of their era in a momentous battle, after getting word that Johnny Royale (another character that would haunt the Powers detectives in the future) was attempting to broker an alliance amongst the villains, to counter the latest superhero team. Wolfe (formerly Haemon) -- Walker's greatest enemy‚Äîshows up during the brawl, and decides Walker is now ready for the reiteration of their eternal duel. For the third time, Wolfe and Walker battle it out to exhaustion. Taking the initiative - and realizing that, like every other time, their fights can only end in stalemate - Walker flies Wolfe into Triphammer's building and activates the Power Drainer. Without powers, Walker is physically superior and proceeds to beat Wolfe half to death, while questioning him as to why he has been torturing him across time. Wolfe simply laughs and says he can no longer remember. Infuriated, Walker throws the fragile Wolfe into the Drainer, causing an explosion that leaves both of them stripped of their powers, seemingly forever. Wolfe is taken to prison and even questioned in the \\"Who Killed Retro-Girl Case?\\" during the first story arc. Walker waits two years before he introduces himself to a Captain on the police force, whom he had helped out in an as-yet unrevealed way earlier on in his career, and so Walker's new life as a detective begins. The final part of the story, although set just after Deena Pilgrim's first case with Christian Walker (see \\"Who Killed Retro-Girl?\\"), concludes the Walker/Wolfe storyline and so still makes up part of Walker's \\"origin\\", seeing as it, in part, makes who Walker is today and concludes the rivalry that shaped him through the ages. It is the modern day and Christian Walker, despite being powerless, has seemingly not aged a day as he became the very successful detective for Homicide cases involving Powers. Wolfe, having lived under a Drainer for the past twenty years, has evolved past Walker to regain his powers, but is rapidly deteriorating. With his body decaying from the sudden release of his long-dormant powers, he searches for Walker at his apartment. When the two confront each other, Wolfe admits he wasn't sure if he even intended to kill Walker. Disturbed and close to death, Wolfe asks for Walker's forgiveness. Walker refuses to give it to him and shoots him in the head. With his last breath, Wolfe hopes to take the \\"mighty Gora\\" out with him, exploding in a huge energy ripple that leaves Walker speechless. The issue and the arc finishes with Walker sitting in silence, clearly gaining no feeling of triumph from the death of his greatest foe. Currently... While investigating the death of a seemingly innocent civilian, Walker learns of a secret interstellar guardian guild known as Millennium. Walker is visited by spectres of both his past and present, who reveal they are actually projections from an alien race who supply the powers and uniform to the secret cosmic guardians of the universe. Choosing Walker as their next in line for Earth, he accepts the powers and new responsibility, with success in his first mission. ==Aliases== Gor *Walker's earliest full- human persona, revealed in the Powers 2008 Annual. Following his battle as a proto-human, Walker retires to a desolate cave where, after many years, he evolves into a full homo sapien. Gor is the worshipped leader of a tribe that has developed around his cave, and already his legend has drawn others to his protection. When one of Gor's tribesmen is murdered by other humans he follows the trail and discovers that his rival, now going by the name Blood Fist, has invented the first stone weapon and violently taken over a tribe. Gora *Many trillions of years ago, Walker was known as the mighty warrior Gora, many books were written about his victories and he was even more famous for having walked away from his kingdom when it was his to take. After doing this, he apparently roamed the known earth, helping people where he could. The Blue and Beige Streak *Walker's first alias as a super-hero and in fact one of the first super-heroes ever, the Blue Streak was created when Walker's brother-in- law got into trouble with the mob after Frank Nitti took over Chicago's crime syndicate. Not wanting them to know his or his wife's identity however, Walker put on a mask to fight crime. It is not known when he gave up this identity. Diamond *During the height of the super-hero era, Walker adopted the costume and name of Diamond. Despite not having been seen for some time, Diamond is still a popular pop culture reference in Powers. Posters will often be seen of him, and many ask where he has gone. Despite this, Walker's identity, while not hugely known, is public knowledge and many fictional fans talk about him on the internet. ==In other media== Christian Walker appears in the live- action series Powers, played by Sharlto Copley. ==References== Category:Image Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Fictional detectives Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000 ","title":"Christian Walker"},{"id":"9150322","text":"Bujalance is a town located in the heart of Andalucia, southern Spain, in the province of C√≥rdoba. , it had 7910 inhabitants.

It was initially published in San Francisco, California in 1987 by Richard Bulger and his partner Chris Nelson and marketed to the bear community within the larger LGBT community. ==HistoryBeginnings=== In San Francisco, in 1987, Richard Bulger began a self-xeroxed magazine called BEAR, dedicated to the appreciation of hairy, bearded, masculine gay men‚Äîsomething completely unrepresented at the time. Bulger had been running a modeling agency called Creative Options Agents (COA) with his photographer partner Chris Nelson. He saw a need for broader markets‚Äîand broader models. Thus, with his connection to gritty, edgy gay biker culture and proximity to the Lone Star Saloon; with the growing success of \\"'zine\\" desktop underground publication taking hold in San Francisco, Richard saw a unique opportunity. Common lore is that BEAR Magazine was begun by a man named Bart Thomas, who died of AIDS before the magazine was first published. In fact \\"Bart Thomas\\" was a pseudonym Richard Bulger chose for himself (\\"bart\\" being the German word for \\"beard\\") in the earliest days of the project. A good friend of Richard Bulger named David Grant was reported to have suggested the name \\"Daddy Bear\\" for this new magazine just before his death from complications from AIDS. The first copy of BEAR Magazine consisted of 45 xeroxed copies, promoted in \\"The Big Ad\\" and \\"Handjob Quarterly\\" (two established 'zines currently enjoying success at the time). Originally created as an alternate to the abundance of shaven men represented in gay mainstream media, BEAR grew over the course of years into an internationally distributed glossy magazine, which featured erotic photographs of masculine, mature men and erotic stories. There was also a classified personals section which, before the emergence of the internet, was one of the few ways for men to find compatible romantic and sexual partners, and to network with like-minded men. The first formal company office was established above a 1908 former fire-house at the corner of 16th and Albion Streets in San Francisco, where their various publications, clothing and lifestyle products were also displayed and sold. Then in 1994 Brush Creek Media moved its office and Bear Store to 367 9th Street in the South-of-Market district which is the center of San Francisco's gay leather district and around the corner from Rick Redewill's Lone Star Saloon. It is important to mention that the close proximity of Brush Creek Media to the Lone Star Saloon resulted in a synergistic relationship. With the Bear Store and nearby bars, shops and hotels catering to the bear-identified, the Lone Star Saloon eventually became the quintessential bear bar, further igniting the bear movement. This formed a circuit for locals, tourists and visitors to events like International Bear Rendezvous and Folsom Street Fair among others. Later that year in 1994, Beardog Hoffman purchased Brush Creek Media Inc. and began expanding the company into several special-interest gay magazines and video series. ===Temporary Setback=== In 2002 Brush Creek Media closed its doors when the IRS seized its inventory. BEAR Magazine was one of the casualties and publication ceased after issue #64. ===A New Chapter=== In 2006, the BEAR trademark was judicially assigned and registered to Butch Media Ltd of Las Vegas, Nevada, a creditor of Brush Creek Media. Similarly, in 2007 the court assigned BEAR Magazine and all the Brush Creek Media copyrights to Butch Media Ltd.U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Serial No. and Bear Omnimedia LLC, the parent company of Butch Media Ltd, revived BEAR Magazine in 2008 starting with issue #65. Under the new direction of Steven Wolfe (Publisher/Editor-in-Chief) and photographer Teddy Mark, the format was again updated in 2010 for an evolved bear movement and LGBT community, and now covers broader aspects of masculinity. BEAR Magazine continues in print as well as digital formats. ==References== ==External links== * Bear Magazine's Official Site Category:LGBT-related magazines published in the United States Category:Men's magazines published in the United States Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Bear (gay culture) Category:Gay men's magazines Category:Magazines established in 1987 Category:Magazines published in Nevada Category:Magazines published in San Francisco Category:Mass media in Las Vegas ","title":"Bear Magazine"},{"id":"9150379","text":"Takoma Academy is a parochial, co-educational high school located in Takoma Park, Maryland operated by the Potomac Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.

The book was based on a series of lectures given by Thomas in 1848 and is written in three parts, The Rudiments Of The World, The Things Of The Kingdom Of God And Of Jesus Christ and The Kingdoms Of The World In Their Relation To The Kingdom Of God.

He stood for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in North Down in the 1982 Assembly elections but failed to be elected. He was first elected as an MLA for the UUP in 2003 and subsequently re-elected in 2007 and again in 2011, before parting company with the UUP in 2012 and joining UKIP. He is a former UUP chief whip and education spokesman. He is the current Assistant Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. ==Political careerUUP=== In 1973, he stood unsuccessfully as a pro-White Paper Unionist candidate in the election to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and unsuccessfully again, this time for the United Ulster Unionist Council, in the Constitutional Convention election of 1975. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Ulster Unionist Party in the Northern Ireland Assembly election of 1982.Northern Ireland elections McNarry was selected in 2001 to contest the Strangford Westminster seat after the incumbent, John Taylor, announced he would be retiring. Iris Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party was the eventual winner of the seat. McNarry is a former local councillor and Deputy Mayor of Ards. Prior to his election to the Assembly, he was an adviser to First Minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble. He stood for the party leadership in 2005 along with Alan McFarland and Lord Reg Empey which Empey went on to win. Following the contest, he was appointed as the UUP education spokesman. He is a former chairman of the Ulster Young Unionist Council. McNarry resigned from the UUP Assembly group on 27 January 2012 after being sacked by party leader Tom Elliott as the Vice Chair of the Assembly Education Committee. During an investigation by a UUP Disciplinary Committee, McNarry was suspended. The new leader Mike Nesbitt commented publicly that he was unlikely to offer McNarry the UUP whip on completion of the suspension. A Northern Ireland Office (NIO) memo released in 2012 described him as \\"a dangerous nuisance\\". ===UKIP=== McNarry left the UUP and joined UKIP in October 2012, becoming UKIP's first MLA and first ever Member of a devolved Assembly in the United Kingdom. In 2013, McNarry was elected unopposed as the UKIP Leader in Northern Ireland. In the May 2014 local government elections, under McNarry's stewardship, UKIP gained two new local councillors in the region, taking the total number of UKIP councillors in Northern Ireland up to four. The party also received 24,584 (3.9%) first preference votes in the 2014 European election in Northern Ireland and although they failed to win a seat, this was a significant electoral performance. At the September 2014 UKIP national conference in Doncaster, McNarry delivered a keynote speech which was warmly received by delegates. He received praise from commentators who referred to the speech as a \\"statesman-like\\" address. In the speech, he noted that UKIP was the only UK-wide party to have elected representation in each of the four parts of the UK. Under McNarry's stewardship, councillors from the DUP, TUV, and a former UUP Belfast Lord Mayor, Bob Stoker, defected to the party. In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, UKIP failed to have a candidate elected, but in terms of votes finished as the highest performing of the non-Executive parties in Northern Ireland, receiving 18,324 (2.6%) votes whilst only fielding candidates in ten of the available eighteen seats. Prior to the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election, McNarry announced his intention to retire from front-line politics. He did not seek re-election to his Strangford seat, but he did represent the party as its Spokesman in the media during the election campaign. In the election, UKIP fielded 13 candidates and drew 10,109 (1.5%) votes. In November 2016, McNarry's term of Office as UKIP Leader in Northern Ireland formally ended when the party elected its new national leader. McNarry remains a supporter of UKIP ‚Äì but is no longer actively involved in party politics. He sits as a board member of the Ulster-Scots Agency. He is also active as a political commentator in the local media. ==References== ==External links== * NI assembly biography * UKIP Northern Ireland official website Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Ulster Unionist Party MLAs Category:Northern Ireland MLAs 2003‚Äì2007 Category:Northern Ireland MLAs 2007‚Äì2011 Category:Northern Ireland MLAs 2011‚Äì2016 Category:Members of Ards Borough Council Category:UK Independence Party MLAs ","title":"David McNarry"},{"id":"9150661","text":"Atlanta's Burning Down is the third studio album by Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band.

During this time, she was a member of the band Bandera Blanca, where she was the drummer. In 1993, she met the guitarist Juan Aguirre, who was a member of the band D√≠as De Vino Y Rosas. Together, they created the band Amaral. They moved to Madrid and later signed a contract with Virgin Records. They have recorded six successful studio albums and have performed as tour support for Lenny Kravitz's Spanish concerts. Their song Rosa de la Paz was included in a record to support Prestige boat victims, also performing at the Nunca M√°is demonstration in Madrid. Moby performs along with Eva Amaral on the song \\"Escapar\\", the Spanish version of the Amaral song \\"Slipping Away\\". Beto Cuevas, front man with the Chilean band \\"La Ley\\" joins Amaral on their song \\"Te Necesito\\". Pajaros En La Cabeza is their most famous album. == Family == Her father, Isidoro Amaral, was born in C√°ceres, Spain. He was the conductor of a music band, even though he did not like music. He died in 1998. Her mother, Carmen Lallana (1943‚Äì2007) died in Zaragoza in 2007. At the beginning, they did not like that their daughter worked as a musician, but they accepted it and ended up loving it. She has an older sister, who \\"was the one that introduced me to the Beatles‚Äô and Simon and Garfunkel‚Äôs music\\". == Biography == Even though some people believe that she was born in 1973, she confirmed that she turned 40 in 2012. \\"I just turned 40 and I feel much more secure and stronger than 20 years ago\\". She claims that she had a joyful childhood and that she never liked to play with dolls. Instead, she would play music with her cousin. She declares that she is shy and that as a teenager, she felt like a weirdo and had many insecurities. At a very young age, she started to play the drums in a self-taught way and she did not think she could sing until she started to do it and realized that it was a much more powerful way to communicate than the drums. She studied in Zaragoza at the school \\"Romareda\\". Afterwards, she studied volume techniques in the art school of Zaragoza. Meanwhile, she also worked as a bartender in \\"Azul Rock Caf√©\\". She began to study lyrical singing when she realized that she wanted to become a singer. First, she took lessons in a civic center, but the teacher was fascinated by her voice and she sent her to her master. \\"Her lessons were very expensive and I did not have much money...\\". She was asked to audition and the master admitted her with a discount. Eva and Juan met in 1992 at the back of a bar in Zaragoza. At that time, she played the drums in a local punk-rock band called \\"Bandera Blanca\\" and was also the leader single of another band called \\"Lluvia √Åcida\\". From the beginning, there was love, friendship and music between the two of them. They went through all the bars performing. They were together for five years before it all started. After that, they began to do some sporadic trips to Madrid and then they started to stay there a little longer, sleeping at friends‚Äô places, working in the catering industry and much more while they performed in \\"Libertad 8\\", \\"San Mateo 6\\", \\"El Rinc√≥n del Arte Nuevo\\" and \\"La Boca del Lobo\\". One day, Jes√∫s Ordov√°s invited them to Radio 3 and sometime later, a guy from the Virgin company attended one of their concerts and decided to work with them. Then, someday in 1997, they made the decision of staying in Madrid. == Musical career  Beginning and success === In 1998, Eva and Juan signed with the company Virgin-EMI and on 18 May, their first album was released. They called it \\"Amaral\\" and it was produced by Pancho Varona and Paco Bastante. The name of the band was Juan's idea, who took Eva's last name, even though she did not like it at first. In 2000, after touring to present her first album, she recorded her second one in London. It was called \\"Una peque√±a parte del mundo\\" (A small part of the world) and it contained 13 songs, 12 written by the band and a version of the song \\"Nada de nada\\" by Cecilia. This time, the album was produced by Cameron Jenkins, who also worked with The Rolling Stones, George Michael and Elvis Costello. Eva met him on the recording of an Enrique Bunbury's album, on which she collaborated. Cameron loved her extraordinary voice since the first time he heard it and he proposed the band to work with him. Jenkins produced all their albums until 2008. In 2001, Eva Amaral was given the title of \\"honorary citizen\\" by the local government of Zaragoza. The band recorded in London their third album, called \\"Estrella de mar\\" (Starfish). This was the best seller in Spain in 2002 and the most successful album of the band so far, having sold more than 2 million copies. The album appears as the number 24 on the list \\"The 50 best Spanish rock albums\\", made by the magazine Rolling Stone. They did a tour for two years where they gave more than 200 concerts and they played as supporting band in a concert of Lenny Kravitz. Furthermore, in 2003, Eva played the leading role in a short film by Andreu Castro called \\"Flores para Maika\\" (Flowers for Maika). === The hard time of \\"P√°jaros en la cabeza\\" === In November 2004, Eva and Juan left to London, where they recorded their fourth album, called \\"P√°jaros en la cabeza\\" (Birds in the head). The album was released in 14 May 2005 and they started the tour in June in Salamanca. Afterwards, they continued the tour in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Amaral made a stop in Barcelona to record the concert and release it on DVD. It was called \\"El comienzo del big bang\\" (The beginning of the big bang). \\"P√°jaros en la cabeza\\" was the most sold album in Spain in 2005, according to the SGAE (Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers). Eva and Juan remember this period as a difficult time. \\"After ‚ÄòP√°jaros en la cabeza‚Äô we toured and it was a long and hard phase. It was all too much to handle. Suddenly, there was a lot of people around us who made us be worried about a lot more things than music, so we decided to detach ourselves from all that. We wanted to reflect on it and live a little\\", says Eva. \\"Eva has shown me that she is very brave and she stays true to herself, against the interests of the market\\", claims Juan. The tour of \\"P√°jaros en la cabeza\\" turned into a nightmare, so they decided to give fewer concerts on the following tour, and with a band formed by friends, not by professional musicians. Juan declares that they \\"needed to go back to their origins\\" and Eva adds that they \\"have lived a complete regression\\". === Fifth record and self-management === In the summer of 2007, while \\"Gato negro-Drag√≥n rojo\\" was being recorded, Eva Amaral's mother died and the singer was not feeling strong enough to continue. \\"First, I thought that by locking myself in the studio I would get through it, but it was not that easy. But here we are, still standing on our feet, thanks to Juan, who really supported me\\". And Eva continues \\"We thought about quitting. We did not do it, but we thought about it\\". Juan also confirms that they almost quit \\"It was a bad time and we thought that maybe this was not making us happy. We liked to make music but we did not like to be public figures. There are some things that happen to you that turn you into something like a puppet, like the one on the cover of \\"P√°jaros en la cabeza\\". During these bad days, the producer Scott Litt had just replied to an email that Juan had sent him before. \\"We had sent him a song and he said that the voice sounded amazing and he wanted to see us. I was freaking out, I thought it was a joke\\", says Juan. Scott moved to Madrid, where he worked for a couple of weeks with the band. But Juan and Eva could not get over the personal downturn so they explained it to Scott and he understood it and stopped the project. \\"We thought that if you do something, you have to do it with all your heart and that was not our best time. We would rather lick our wounds on our own, we care more about ourselves than the band\\", continues Juan. Finally, Eva and Juan started the year 2008 making a version of \\"A Hard Rain¬¥s a-Gonna Fall\\" by Bob Dylan, the promotional song for the Expo Zaragoza 2008. The name of the version was Llegar√° la tormenta. On 27 May 2008 was released the fifth album of the duo from Zaragoza with the title \\"Gato negro-Drag√≥n rojo\\", a double disc with 19 songs. The tour 2008 started in Zaragoza in December 2008. They were accompanied by a new band, formed by Coki Gim√©nez (drums), Zulaima Boheto (cello), Octavio Vinck (acoustic guitar), Iv√°n Gonz√°lez (bass guitar) and Quique Mavilla (keyboard). On 2009, they had another tour that started in March in the Palau de la M√∫sica in Barcelona, a concert that was included on the Guitar Festival of the city. On July 2009, they participated in the concert of MTV Spain Murcia Night, celebrated in Cartagena by the wall of Carlos III and for more than 35.000 people. On 22 September 2009, closing the \\"Gato negro-Drag√≥n rojo\\" cycle, Amaral published a double CD+DVD/Blu-Ray named La barrera del sonido, which includes the concert recorded in the Palacio de los Deportes in Madrid in October 2008, closing like this a season to start a new band with the next studio album. With \\"Gato negro-Drag√≥n rojo\\" they started to self-manage their own songs. \\"(‚Ä¶) it¬¥s an idea that came up in 2006 and we started doing in 2007. This year we¬¥ve seen that it has caused interest. For us, it is a step forward\\" ‚Äúit¬¥s something that comes from long ago. We started the path of self-management with \\"Gato negro-Drag√≥n rojo\\", but the idea that we had was already from many years ago. We had our ideal world where everyone can just manage themselves and keep everything more familiar. As I was saying, we started the last CD with our own brand but it was distributed by EMI but this year we¬¥ve taken another step. The distribution is done by a small Spanish company and the truth is, we are very happy. We don¬¥t have any kind of problem with EMI, in fact, we still have a good relationship with them\\". === National Award for Modern Music === On 27 October 2010, the Spanish Ministry of Culture gave Amaral the II National Award of Modern Music 2010 for their \\"contribution to the renovation of the current music panorama\\". The prize consisted of an amount of ‚Ç¨30,000. The jury, headed by General Director of the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music (INAEM), F√©lix Palomero, consisted of Dania D√©vora, Rosa Le√≥n, Diego Alfredo Manrique, Luis Mendo, Beatriz P√©cker, Joan Manuel Serrat and Antonio Garde, the deputy director of Music and Dance of INAEM who acted as vice president. Through an official statement, the band thanked the jury for the prize and dedicated it to all of their fans. Likewise, they recognize their evolution (from small gigs to big concerts) and see this prize as a starting point to follow in the search for the \\"perfect concert\\" and their \\"best CD\\". The money was donated to the Vicente Ferrer Foundation and it will be used to build 16 houses in the village of Madirebail, in Anantapur, and to guarantee the university studies of 4 students. The award was given on 12 July 2011 in La Seu Vella (L√©rida), in front of the Princes of Asturias at the time, the Minister of Culture (√Ångeles Gonz√°lez-Sinde), the counselor of Culture (Ferr√°n Mascarel) and the mayor of the city (√Ångel Ros). Jordi Folgado collected the award, as the director of the Vincente Ferrer Foundation. === Sixth record under a personal brand === \\"Hacia lo salvaje\\" is the name of the sixth album by the band, released on 27 September 2011, already under the new brand created for the band, called \\"Ant√°rtida\\" and also produced by herself, Juan Aguirre and Juan de Dios Mart√≠n. Eva explains the name of the brand saying that \\"since we edited the CD with our own brand, it turned out that we didn¬¥t have a name because we are a bit of a mess (laughs). We also didn¬¥t care if it was our brand or Pepito Records'. We decided to name it ‚ÄúAnt√°rtida\\" because we were recording that song in the moment and it gave us the idea. We loved the image of the Antarctica, a completely imagined place as we've never been there. However, we loved the whiteness, something so pure and so real that it dazzles you. It also reminded us of that blank paper you have to face every time you start to write a song\\". The presentation tour began in Zaragoza 6 October, where they performed five concerts in a row with all tickets sold out. \\"Hacia lo salvaje\\" was chosen as the third most important Spanish CD of 2011 by the Rolling Stone magazine. * Trivia In 2012, she collaborated with the Spanish heavy metal band Bar√≥n Rojo in the song \\"La Reina √Åcida\\" from their new album \\"Tommy Bar√≥n\\". (The Spanish version of the song \\"Acid Queen\\" by The Who). ==References== ==External links== * Official Website in Spanish * Official Website in English * Unofficial Website in Spanish * Amaral's Fansite with videos, songs, photos in Spanish * Flores Para Maika Website in Spanish *Link to Amaral Song on Otro Corto Website in Spanish Category:Rock en Espa√±ol musicians Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish guitarists Category:Spanish female singer-songwriters Category:People from Zaragoza Category:Spanish rock singers Category:Aragonese musicians Category:Aragonese singers Category:Spanish female pop singers Category:21st- century Spanish singers Category:21st-century women singers Category:21st- century guitarists ","title":"Eva Amaral"},{"id":"9150754","text":"ULYSSES is a submarine communications cable network divided into two sections: ULYSSES-1 and ULYSSES-2 that transit the English Channel and the North Sea, respectively.

Gerard Callenburgh. Gerard was born in Willemstad, the son of a wood-trader, but chose to enter the Dutch navy in 1661 as a cadet, serving the Admiralty of the Maze. He was made second lieutenant in May 1666 during the Second Anglo- Dutch War. On 10 February 1671 he was promoted lieutenant. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War he served on Michiel de Ruyter's flagship, De Zeven Provinci√´n, in the Battle of Solebay. He was promoted to extraordinary captain on 15 March 1673, serving as second flagcaptain of De Zeven Provinci√´n in the Battle of Texel, below captain Pieter de Liefde. On 13 February 1674 he was made a full captain. In 1676 he commanded the Eendragt, the flagship of De Ruyter in the Mediterranean. When De Ruyter was killed, he became acting Vice- Admiral as squadron leader of the van, bringing home the body of the Admiral. In 1688 he was captain of the Maagd van Dordrecht in the invasion fleet of William III of Orange during the Glorious Revolution. Having excellent relations with the stadtholder he became Vice-Admiral of the Admiralty of the Northern Quarter on 16 April 1689. In 1690 he fought in the Battle of Beachy Head on the West-Friesland. On 18 April 1692 he returned to the Admiralty of de Maze in Rotterdam, using the new and fourth De Zeven Provinci√´n as flagship. However, on 20 November 1697 he again was relocated to the Admiralty of the Northern Quarter to be its Lieutenant-Admiral. He achieved his greatest fame during the War of Spanish Succession. In 1702, the Beschermer (90 cannon) was his flagship in the Battle of Vigo Bay. In 1704 he participated in the Anglo-Dutch invasion of Gibraltar, and helped in its defense in the Battle of V√©lez-M√°laga as commander of the Rear Division, when his flagship was the Graaf van Albemarle (64). On 14 February 1709 he was relocated to the Admiralty of Amsterdam; on 19 February 1711 his last assignment was with his old Admiralty of the Maas, making him supreme operational commander of the Dutch fleet, though he never fought in that capacity. Such changes, very rare in the earlier 17th century, now became common as centralisation grew and provincial loyalty and strife diminished. From 1678 to 1711 Callenburgh was a member of the vroedschap (town council) of Vlaardingen and often was chosen to be one of the burgomasters for a period of time. He died in Vlaardingen. ==Legacy== A Dutch type of destroyers was named after him : the Gerard Callenburgh class. ==Literature== *T. van Gent (2000), 17 Zeventiende eeuwse admiralen en hun zeeslagen, Plantijn Casparie Hilversum/Koninklijke Vereniging van Marineofficieren Category:17th-century Dutch military personnel Category:Admirals of the navy of the Dutch Republic Category:18th-century Dutch people Category:Royal Netherlands Navy admirals Category:Dutch naval commanders in the War of the Spanish Succession Category:Dutch naval personnel of the Anglo-Dutch Wars Category:1642 births Category:1722 deaths Category:People from Vlaardingen ","title":"Gerard Callenburgh"},{"id":"9150836","text":"Friedrich Christian, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe Friedrich Christian, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe (16 August 1655 ‚Äì 13 June 1728) was the second ruler of the County of Schaumburg-Lippe. ==Biography== He was born in B√ºckeburg, the son of Philip I, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe and Landgravine Sophie of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (1615‚Äì1670).

It is now a city park under the auspices of the city of London, KY. The park encompasses and includes a section of the Wilderness Road that early settlers used to reach Kentucky. The park is named for Levi Jackson, an early Kentucky pioneer. It serves as both a recreational and historic park. ==History== The historic Wilderness Road was the main route used by settlers for more than 50 years to reach Kentucky from Virginia. In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky. It was later lengthened, following Native American trails, to the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. The Wilderness Road was rough and steep. In the early days of the trail, it could only be traveled on foot or horseback. As more travelers passed, the road improved and horse-drawn wagons were able to follow the trail. In spite of the conditions, thousands of people used it. Many of their descendants still live in Kentucky including members of the McNitt Company, a group of pioneers who were attacked by Native Americans on October 3, 1786. The park is crossed by portions of the Wilderness Road and Boone's Trace, another pioneer trail blazed by Daniel Boone. It is still open today to hiking and while the Wilderness Road has since been paved as part of Kentucky Route 229. Levi Jackson was one of the first settlers in Laurel County. He arrived in 1802 with his partner, John Freeman, who claimed a large tract of land along the Wilderness Road as payment for Freeman's services in the American Revolutionary War. Jackson built a large two-story house which he licensed as a tavern in 1803. He and John Freeman ran the Wilderness Road Tavern and Laurel River Post Office. The surrounding area became known as \\"Jackson's Farm\\" and remained in the Jackson family until 1931 when the land was donated to the state to honor the pioneers of Kentucky. The land on which Levi Jackson Wilderness Road Park sits was donated to the state by his descendants in 1931. The park facilities were constructed during the Great Depression in 1935. The National Park Service spent $55,000, building cabins, foot-bridges, parking areas, an auditorium, and observation tower. Additionally, the Civilian Conservation Corps restored an old log cabin and built McHargue's Mill in 1939. ==FeaturesMill=== McHargue's Mill is a reproduction working watermill with authentic interior works. It was built on the banks of the Little Laurel River by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1939. Outside the mill is a large display of millstones. The working stones in the mill were brought over the Wilderness Road in 1805. Fresh ground corn meal can be purchased by visitors. The mill is open seasonally. ===Museum=== The Mountain Life Museum is a restored pioneer village that consists of several cabins and other pioneer era structures. Some of the cabins are arranged with tools and household items to demonstrate what a pioneer settlement looked like during the Wilderness Road era. Relics of the early settlers and the displaced Native Americans are also on display. Buildings on the grounds include a barn, stable, loom house, church and blacksmith shop. The blacksmith has barred windows and was used as a jail in location filming of The Kentuckian, a 1955 movie starring Burt Lancaster. As of 2014, the museum is closed to the public. ===Burial ground=== The McNitt Company was one of many large groups of early settlers who used the Wilderness Road to cross the Appalachian Mountains and move into the Ohio Valley. The group of fourteen families came under attack on the evening of October 3, 1786. On that night they failed to post a guard against attacks by Native Americans on whose land the settlers were encroaching. The settlers \\"danced and drank until late the evening\\" and were attacked after they had fallen asleep. Twenty-four known victims died that night with just three survivors. The dead were buried near the site of the massacre at what is known as the Defeated Camp Burial Ground, within the boundaries of Levi Jackson Wilderness Road State Park. ==Activities and amenities== The park is open for year-round recreation including picnicking, camping, hiking and bird-watching. *Camping: The park's wooded campground has 136 sites. Campers have access to utility hook-ups and a grocery store. There are three central services buildings featuring laundry and shower facilities as well as modern latrines.

It was while studying at Columbia that Martin's vocal talents were discovered. In 1901 he was granted an endowment by industrialist Henry Flagler to study to further his vocal studies in Paris with Giovanni Sbriglia, Jean de Reszke and L√©on Escala√Øs. Martin later completed his studies with Vincenzo Lombardi in Florence and Beniamino Carelli in Naples. He debuted as Faust in Nantes in 1904. Two years later he made his American debut in New Orleans, singing with the visiting San Carlo Opera. Martin bowed at the Metropolitan Opera on November 20, 1907 in Mefistofele; the performance also marked the American debut of Fyodor Chaliapin. Martin remained with the Metropolitan through the 1914-15 season, appearing in numerous leading tenor roles; he was among the first American-born leading men the company employed. He returned for the 1917-18 season. During his tenure at the Met, he created the lead tenor roles in three American operas: Walter Damrosch's Cyrano, Horatio Parker's Mona, and Frederick Shepherd Converse's The Pipe of Desire. After leaving the company he appeared with numerous companies throughout America and Europe, and spent three seasons with the Chicago Civic Opera. Martin died in New York City in 1952. ==Personal life== Martin is known to have married at least three times according to newspaper accounts and vital records. He first married in 1899, to Elfrida Hildegarde Klamroth, a fellow opera singer more widely known by the stage name Ruano Bogislav. They had one child, Beth Martin, commonly and professionally known as Bijie Martin. The couple divorced before 1920, largely due to career differences. Martin's 1923 marriage to aspiring actress Jane Grey also ended in divorce. His last known marriage was in 1932, to Allis Beaumont, who has recently become famous as Allis Beaumont Reid in the documentary \\"Must Read After My Death\\" (2007). ==References== *David Ewen, Encyclopedia of the Opera: New Enlarged Edition.

It began development in 1971, and was completed in 1973. It was a 32mm¬≤ MOS integrated circuit chip with about 2,800 silicon gates, fabricated on a 6 ¬µm process with NMOS logic. It was used in the Ford EEC engine control unit system, which began production in 1974 and went into mass production in 1975. The system memory included 512-bit RAM, 2kb ROM and 2kb EPROM. == TLCS-47 family == The microcontrollers in the TLCS-47 category are 4-bit systems. These are no longer advertised on the Toshiba website. == TLCS-48 family == The TLCS-48 family were clones of the Intel MCS-48 (8048) microcontroller. Alt URL == TLCS-Z80 family == Toshiba Z84C00 These were a series of Zilog Z80 compatible microcontrollers. == TLCS-90 family == Development version of a TLCS-90 family microcontroller with EPROM socket The microcontrollers in the TLCS-90 family use a 8-bit/16-bit architecture reminiscent of the Z80. These are no longer advertised on the Toshiba web site. Z80 features present in the TLCS-90 include: * seven 8-bit registers (A, B, C, D, E, H and L), * six 16-bit registers (BC, DE, HL, IX, IY, and SP), three of which are 8-bit register pairs, * the combined parity/overflow flag, * the unusual , and instructions, and * the and memory copy instructions. There are, however, significant differences. It omits the separate I/O address space of the Z80, but adds operations (notably multiply and divide) and several additional addressing modes: * stack pointer relative , * one-byte \\"zero page\\" addressing of memory from FF00-FFFF16, and * indexed . Also, the IX and IY registers are 20 bits wide, allowing the processor to address up to one megabyte of memory. Instructions are divided into one-byte basic and two-byte extended instructions. Opcodes E016 through FE16 are prefixes which begin an extended instruction. The instruction encoding is unusual in that the prefix specifies one operand of the extended instruction, and unlike the single-byte prefixes used by the Z80 or x86 architecture, may itself be followed by operand bytes. After the prefix bytes, the second opcode byte specifies the operation and second operand. For example, the instruction is encoded as , where the first two bytes specify the destination address, the third byte specifies the operation, and the fourth byte provides the source operand. == TLCS-870 family == The microcontrollers in the TLCS-870 family (TLCS-870, TLCS-870/X, TLCS-870/C and TLCS-870/C1 series) use a 8-bit/16-bit architecture inspired by the TLCS-90, but less like the Z80. The TLCS-870 is the original, with a 16-bit address space, which was extended in two different directions: * TLCS-870/X extends the architecture to 20 bits in an upward-compatible way. * TLCS-870/C retains the 16-bit address space, and provides a compatible assembly language, but changes the instruction encoding so that a different object code is required. * TLCS-870/C1 is an upward-compatible variant of the 870/C with minor extensions. == TLCS-900 family == The TLCS-900 family extend the TLCS-90 architecture to 32-bit registers and a 24-bit address bus. Most implementations (TLCS-900, TLCS-900/L, TLCS-900/H and TLCS-900/L1 series) have 16-bit internal data paths, like the MC68000 , while the TLCS-900/H1 series is 32 bits wide internally (like the MC68020). The instruction set is upward- compatible with the TLCS-90, although the binary encoding differs. The early models supported both a \\"minimum mode\\" where some registers (including the program counter) were 16 bits wide and a \\"maximum mode\\" which had all 32-bit general purpose registers. Later models omitted the minimum mode. == Features and differences == Current TLCS processors offer some or all of the following features: *multifunction, bi-directional general purpose I/O ports with optional built-in pull-up resistors *mask programmable, one time programmable, flash memory or EEPROM type of ROM. ROMless versions are also available *a variety of serial interfaces: **I¬≤C **Synchronous/Asynchronous Serial Peripherals (UART/USART) (used with RS-232, RS-485, and more) **Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI) ** USB *watchdog timer (WDT) *multiplexed 10-bit A/D converters; D/A converters *dual clock inputs and on-line clock switching by selecting different gear values (frequency divider), thus allowing either low-power low-frequency modes or high-performance high- frequency modes *prescalable 8-bit and 16-bit timers (may be used as Programmable Interval Timers) *8-bit and 16-bit pulse-width modulation (PWM) and programmable pulse generation (PPG) output *power voltage supply range between 1.8 and 5.5 Volt *external interrupt control *pattern generator, suitable for stepper motor control *Chip select/wait controller *different chip carrier formats As demand for these features differs widely depending on the requirements for a specific project (low energy consumption; high number of I/O ports; etc.), customers can choose from a wide range of different versions. == Development tools == Toshiba offers an ANSI C compatible C compiler and an assembler. Neither tool is available for free. The free Small Device C Compiler supports the TLCS-90. There is a project for porting GNU assembler to the TLCS-900 family. Alfred Arnold's The Macroassembler AS is a free assembler supporting the TLCS-47, TLCS-870, TLCS-90, TLCS-900 and TLCS-9000 families. == References == == External links == *Toshiba Japan website about the TLCS series *Toshiba USA website about the TLCS series Category:Microcontrollers Category:Toshiba ","title":"Toshiba TLCS"},{"id":"9150967","text":"Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum ( ‹°‹™‹¢ ‹°‹™‹ù ‹ê‹ù‹ì‹¢‹õ‹ù‹ò‹£ ‹ê‹¶‹™‹ù‹° ‹í‹™‹®‹ò‹°) (June 15, 1887 ‚Äì June 23, 1957) was the 120th Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church. He wrote, translated and published many scholarly works, including books on the tradition, liturgy, music, and history of Syriac Orthodox Church. ==Early life and career== He was born in Mosul, Ottoman Empire, and attended a school run by Dominican friars. He studied French and Turkish as well as religious literature and history, and later learned Arabic from studies under Muslim scholars. At the Deir al-Za\`faran monastery in Mardin, Turkey, where he started his theological training in 1905, he studied the Syriac language and literature. After his ordination as a priest in 1908, he remained at the monastery to teach, and in 1911 he assumed the additional responsibility of managing the monastery press. Later that year he began a scholar's visit to the monasteries and churches of Mesopotamia and Turkey. Soon after his return in 1913 he made a similar trip to examine Syriac manuscripts in the great libraries of Europe. ==Episcopal career== On May 20, 1918, Patriarch Ignatius Elias III consecrated Aphrem as metropolitan Mor Severius and named him the bishop of Syria. Rev. Joel E. Werda led the Assyrian delegation from the USA, representing the Diaspora community in Paris Peace Conference, 1919. He accompanied Bishop Aphrem Barsoum and his secretary. He was disillusioned, however, by the atmosphere of self-interest which prevailed among the delegates representing the European powers, and at one stage of the conference found himself defending not only the rights of the Assyrians, but those of the Arab nations. Though Mor Severius did not succeed in protecting the Assyrian's interests at Paris, the journey gave him ample opportunity for further study of Syriac literature before his return in May, 1920. Two years later, the League of Nations' action making Syria a French mandate brought him the new responsibility of providing for refugees from Cilicia, and he also undertook the building of many new churches in and near Aleppo. Another journey took Mor Severius to Geneva and Lausanne as an apostolic delegate to the World Conference on Faith and Order (August 3‚Äì21, 1927). Soon afterwards he came as an emissary of the Patriarch to the United States, where he investigated the condition of the Syriac Orthodox Church, consecrated three new churches, and ordained new priests. He also gave lectures on the Syriac language and literature at the Providence University and the University of Chicago, and served at the Oriental Institute of the latter institution until his return in 1929. ==Patriarchal Consecration== After the death of Patriarch Ignatius Elias III in 1932, the Synod of Bishops named Mor Severius his acting successor. On January 30, 1933, he was formally elected Patriarch of Antioch, assuming the ecclesiastical name of Mor Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum. The new Patriarch quickly showed himself as an active Church head, establishing new dioceses and founding a theological seminary at Zahla, Lebanon (later moved to Mosul, and then to Beirut). In the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the political situation in the new state of Turkey, where Deir al-Za\`faran, the seat of the Patriarchate, was located, Mor Aphrem was forced to relocate the Patriarchate to Homs in Syria. The great Patriarch died on June 23, 1957 and was buried in Homs. ==Literary works== Despite the numerous responsibilities of his work in the Church and frequent interruptions for travel, the Patriarch devoted much of his time to writing. Patriarch Aphrem produced many other works which have never been published. His Syriac-Arabic lexicon and his compendium of church history in the 20th century are written in both Syriac and Arabic. His history of Tur Abdin, in Syriac, was translated into Arabic by Bishop Bahnam. In Arabic, he also wrote a history of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch and the famous men of the Syriac Orthodox Church, a history of Syriac Orthodox Church dioceses, an index of Syriac manuscripts, and translations of ten liturgies of the Syriac Christianity. Also, he translated into Arabic the second part of the Ecclesiastical History of Bar \`Ebroyo in 1909 when he was a monk at the Monastery of Za\`faran. ===The Scattered Pearls=== The Scattered Pearls: history of Syriac literature and sciences () is a survey of Syriac literature; the review was written in the 1920s by Barsoum. The book was translated to several languages, the English by Matti Musa in 2003 (Gorgias Press ). ==See also== *Syriac Orthodox Church *Jacob Baradaeus *List of Patriarchs of Antioch - to 518 *List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch - list from 518 *Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church *Indian Orthodox Church *Saint Thomas Christians (Syrian Malabar Nasrani) *Mor Julius Isa Cicek *Ignatius Zakka I Iwas *Ignatius Afram I Barsoum *Ignatius Elias III ==References== ==External links== * Biography from Margonitho: Syriac Orthodox Resources * Biography from Syriac Orthodox in India Category:1887 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Assyrian Iraqi writers Category:Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch Category:Syriac writers Category:Syriacists Category:People from Mosul Category:Iraqi Assyrian people Category:Assyrians of the Ottoman Empire Category:20th-century Iraqi writers Category:19th-century people of Ottoman Iraq Category:20th-century people of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Ignatius Aphrem I"},{"id":"9150999","text":"Fred Talbot (born 1949) is a British former teacher and television presenter.

It took place February 3, 1863 near Wƒôgr√≥w in east Masovia. On January 22, Polish partisans liberated a town from Russian forces. Here Poles established a military base, in a few days gathering almost 3,500 soldiers.Eligiusz Koz≈Çowski, Mieczys≈Çaw Wrzosek, Historia orƒô≈ºa polskiego (The History of Polish Military), ; Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Wiedza Powszechna, Warszawa 1984, , pp.333-. But the Russians decided to recapture Wƒôgr√≥w by rapid attack force composed of a 1,000-strong unit with artillery, led by colonel Georgi Papaafanasopulo. The Poles were threatened by encirclement, and Polish commander Jan Matli≈Ñski ordered a retreat from the town. He left about 500 scythemen to cover the retreat of the main forces. Scythemen attacked the Russian left flank and routed Russian cavalry squadron and cannons, ensuring the safe retreat of the Polish forces from the town. Almost all attacking scythemen were killed by Russian infantry fire. Russians entered the town, but most of the Polish forces had already left it. The Polish attack was heard of throughout Europe. French poet Henri Auguste Barbier wrote a poem Attack at Wƒôgr√≥w, comparing the Polish fighters to Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.

The Great Western Railway put up half the capital, making it in effect a GWR subsidiary. It opened in 1874, and most long distance passenger and goods traffic, especially the heavy mineral traffic, transferred to it. It amalgamated with the GWR in 1876. The Llantarnam Link, connecting the upper Eastern Valley network, was opened in 1878 and from that time most local traffic transferred to the line. The main line was increasingly used for long distance passenger and goods traffic, especially from Bristol and the West of England after the opening of the Severn Tunnel. As local traffics declined and were extinguished, the PC&NR; main line remained a key part of the North and West Route from the Severn to Shrewsbury and from there to the Mersey, and North Wales, and carries that traffic at the present day. ==The Eastern Valley Line of the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company== The Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway in 1878In 1845 the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was authorised to build a line from Newport to Pontnewynydd, a short distance north-west of Pontypool, connecting industrial areas there. There were already mineral tramways beyond Pontnewynydd, but they brought mineral products to the canal, where they had to be transshipped for onward conveyance to Newport. The \\"Newport and Ponty-pool Railway\\", as it was called at first, was to be a standard gauge railway by-passing the canal and avoiding the delay and cost of the transshipment. The line was soon known as the Eastern Valley Line of the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company. The South Wales Main Line of the Great Western Railway was broad gauge at the time, and no connection between the two railways at Newport was contemplated.Aubrey Byles, The History of the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company, Village Publishing, Cwmbran, 1982, At the same time the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway had a Bill in Parliament for its line; it was promoted independently and was to be standard gauge. In this period Parliament was concerned to restrict what it saw as unnecessary parallel routes, and in authorising the NA&HR; line in 1846, it refused it permission to build south of Pontypool. The NA&HR; had to make a junction with the MR&C; company, and use its line from Pontypool to Newport. It also had to use the MR&CR; passenger station there, although mineral traffic to the docks was considerably dominant, and a northward flow, of coal to the River Mersey for bunkering ships, developed strongly.D S M Barrie, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas Nairn, second edition 1994, Stanley C Jenkins and Martin Loader, The Great Western Railway: volume 4: North and West Route, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2014, Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1981, There was a national financial crisis at the time of authorisation of these lines, and it proved impossible for some time to raise the capital for construction, which was much delayed. The Eastern Valley Line was eventually opened on 30 June 1852. The Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway was opened to goods trains on 30 July 1852, and full public opening to passengers took place on 2 January 1854.It was delayed due to a landslip. The iron and coal production in the lines served by the Monmouthshire line developed very considerably over the succeeding years, and although the company doubled the track, there was severe congestion, and the NA&HR; trains were adversely affected. The NA&HR; built its Taff Vale Extension Line from Pontypool to Quakers Yard, opening progressively from 1855 to 1858. This east-west route intersected numerous valleys and as their own railway systems developed, many mineral sites used the Taff Vale Extension to pass their production towards London and the north-west of England. The NA&HR; was merged with other companies to form the West Midland Railway in 1860, and that company in turn amalgamated with the Great Western Railway in 1863. Coal production at Aberdare was exceptionally buoyant, and much of the product was sent to London.Over \\"narrow\\" (standard) gauge routes via Hereford> Traffic from the collieries and ironworks in the area of the Upper Eastern Valley was brought into Newport docks over the Eastern Valley Main Line. If it was to continue from Newport by rail, the load was transshipped at sidings at Waterloo Junction, near Ebbw Junction, within the Newport sidings complex; the GWR was still a broad gauge railway at this time. The traffic could then continue towards Gloucester on the GWR main line.The Severn Tunnel was not opened until 1886. Newport GWR station itself was extremely congested at the time, and the transit over the Eastern Valley Line was in itself difficult. ==The Caerleon line proposed== The Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway (PC&NR;)There was another PC&NR; nearby: the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway. was promoted in the 1865 session of Parliament to build a new route to avoid the lower part of the Eastern Valley Line: it was an independent company. It was to build a standard gauge railway totalling, with branches, twelve miles in extent, from a triangular junction at Pontypool to a triangular junction at Maindee, immediately east of Newport station. At Pontypool this gave access from Hereford over the NA&HR; main line, and from their Taff Vale Extension Line. It appearsFrom the statutory newspaper announcement referenced. that the Blaenavon and Abersychan districts on the upper part of the Monmouthshire Railway were not to be connected at Pontypool, but by a connection to the Eastern Valley Main Line further south, near the 3 milepost from Newport, at a point where the River Usk makes a northward sweep near Malpas. Making the connection here would give access from the industrial sites intermediately on the Eastern Valley. (This connection was not actually made.) At Maindee, the westward arm of the triangular junction, coupled with the proposed mixed gauge track, would give access to Newport High Street station of the GWR, and to Waterloo Junction, where transhipment from narrow (standard) gauge wagons to broad gauge already took place; and also to the docks area in general. The eastern arm of the triangle to the future Maindee East Junction led nowhere, as there were no siding or other facilities to handle arriving narrow gauge trains. Powers were taken for the Great Western Railway, the Midland Railway and the London & North Western Railway, or any of them, to use or work the line or to subscribe for shares in the Company. Most importantly powers were taken for the laying of mixed gauge track on the GWR main line between Maindee West Junction and Waterloo Junction, and the use of Newport High Street GWR station.Statutory announcement in the Derbyshire Advertiser and Journal, 23 November 1864 The proposal was speculative; the junctions with the broad gauge GWR would still require transshipping of goods and minerals for onward transit, and the eastward spur at Maindee did not lead to sidings where that might be done. Nevertheless the possibility of the LNWR, who were running passenger trains to Newport over the Monmouthshire line, getting a firmer foothold at Newport was unattractive to the GWR, and it encouraged the new company. At the same time the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was extremely hostile, as the new line would abstract much of their Eastern Valley business. ==Authorisation== The Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 5 July 1865. Authorised capital was ¬£100,000,E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 of which the Great Western Railway subscribed ¬£50,000. However by this time it was plain that commercial pressure would oblige the GWR to convert the broad gauge track on the South Wales Main Line to narrow (standard) gauge in the foreseeable future. Moreover as the GWR had secured an alliance with the Caerleon line-- subscribing half the capital put the GWR in charge--the LNWR was for the time being excluded. Consequently in the meantime the GWR and the PC&NR; did not hasten to construct the line. The alliance was strengthened in 1871 by an understanding between the two companies, under which the board of the PC&NR; Company were entirely GWR nominees. The alignment of the PC&NR; to the GWR increased the hostility of the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company to the project, and this may explain the omission of the proposed connection near Caerleon. ==Opening== With the gauge conversion of the GWR lines in South Wales completed in 1872, the construction of the Caerleon line was put in hand, and it was opened to goods traffic on 17 September 1874, and to passenger trains on 21 December 1874.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 The London and North Western Railway was running passenger trains from Shrewsbury to Newport at the time, and these were transferred to Newport High Street station over the new line, enabling direct change of train for passengers there, from 1 January 1875.Barrie page 65; he says \\"From 1 January 1875 a LNWR through Shrewsbury - Mill Street passenger service operated.\\" He must mean High Street, not Mill Street. The inauguration of the new line enabled the Great Western Railway to divert to the route all of its traffic from the Eastern Valley Line; this included its heavy flow of coal from Aberdare over the Taff Vale Extension Line and over the PC&NR; line, turning east at Maindee to London and Southampton (via Basingstoke). Moreover the inconvenience of transshipping local narrow gauge traffic at Waterloo Junction and continuing through Newport was eliminated. ==Impact on the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company== The opening of the line had a considerable effect on the Monmouthshire Eastern Valley Line, as much business was diverted away from their line. The success of the transfer of traffic encouraged the GWR to propose a line connecting Sirhowy and Caerleon. The Taff Vale Extension Line was steeply graded and not without difficulty in operation, whereas the Sirhowy route would have easier gradients for the loaded mineral trains from Aberdare and elsewhere. It would avoid the use of the upper parts of the Monmouthshire Railway's Eastern Valley altogether; at the time the Monmouthshire company was suffering from a competitive disadvantage due to failure to modernise, and this new move threatened the further loss of a very considerable part of that company's business. At first the Monmouthshire opposed the GWR plans in the House of Commons, but the Bill passed nonetheless. Seeing the situation clearly now, the Monmouthshire negotiated a 99 year leaseTechnically an unlimited grant of running powers. of its 51 mile network to the GWR, which was effective from 1 August 1875. As well as the railways, the canal network also passed to the GWR: both arms of the original Monmouthshire Canal, except for the northern two miles above Pontymoile, which had been converted to a railway in 1854, and the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal. The PC&NR; was amalgamated with the GWR on 13 July 1876. ==Llantarnam link== The PC&N; line gave access to Newport and to the South Wales Main Line eastwards at Maindee, but at its northern end it was connected to Pontypool Road. Traffic from the Taff Vale Extension Line and from the Hereford direction could run directly to it, but local traffic from the upper sections of the Eastern Valley Line could only reach it by reversing at the Coedygric sidings complex near Pontypool Road. Now that those lines were all in GWR hands, the time had come to connect them. A connecting line further south, joining the Eastern Valley Line with the PC&NR; line near Cwmbran; it was 67 chains in length from Cwmbran Junction to Llantarnam Junction, and it opened in April 1878. From the following year all through traffic and local passenger trains were diverted away from the lower Eastern Valley Line. ==Growth== The availability of the Maindee East Loop coupled with the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886 vastly simplified the transfer of coal traffic to London and also to Portland and Southampton, where bunkering Royal Navy and ocean-going commercial shipping was experiencing considerable growth. As far as passenger services were concerned, as well as trains from Cardiff and Newport to the Hereford and Shrewsbury line, a developing traffic ran from Bristol and the West of England after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886 northwards from Maindee East Junction through Hereford. This enabled trains to reach the River Mersey (at Birkenhead) over track controlled solely or jointly by the GWR, whereas routing via Gloucester and Birmingham was dependent on the co-operation of competing companies. The route was marketed as \\"The North and West Route\\", and use of the route for through goods and passenger trains became very heavy.P W B Semmens, The Heydey of GWR Train Services, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1990, ==Decline of coal, and of local passenger traffic== Following 1945 coal business declined, gradually at first. The marginal pits in the Eastern Valley were hit, and the Eastern Valley line from Cwmbran Junction to Newport closed from 27 October 1963, all residual traffic being routed over the PC&NR; line. Local passenger traffic declined too, and many wayside stations had closed from 30 April 1962, and this left no passenger station open on the former PC&NR.; Only a basic Cardiff - Hereford - Shrewsbury service remained, although through freight business was reasonably buoyant.

(Prior to that, Ogunquit had been a village within the town of Wells.) Throughout 2008 and 2009, in an effort to comply with the state's 2008 school consolidation law, the district attempted to find another district to merge with, in order to form a Regional School Unit. Wells-Ogunquit explored merging with MSAD 71 (Kennebunk-Kennebunkport), as well as the York and Kittery school departments, but was unable to reach an agreement with any of them. Wells-Ogunquit submitted a waiver application to the state, which was rejected. The state then recommended that Wells-Ogunquit merge with the Acton School Department, despite the substantial geographic distance between Acton and the Wells- Ogunquit area. Under the pressure of a deadline from the state, the towns of Acton, Ogunquit, and Wells held referendums to determine whether voters would approve or deny the consolidation. Voters in all three towns rejected the plan. Under the consolidation law, Wells-Ogunquit is therefore allowed to remain a \\"stand-alone\\" district with no penalty. ==Governance== The district is governed by a school committee, which consists of six elected at-large members: three from Ogunquit and three from Wells. Committee members serve for three-year terms. The votes of Wells committee members are weighted more heavily than the votes of Ogunquit committee members, in order to reflect the population difference between the two towns. ==Schools and ProgramsCurrent=== Wells High School Wells Junior High School * Wells Elementary School provides classes for students in Kindergarten through fourth grade. 2011‚Äì2012 enrollment: 478 students. * Wells Junior High School provides classes for students in fifth grade through eighth grade. 2011‚Äì2012 enrollment: 449 students. * Wells High School provides classes for students in ninth grade through twelfth grade. 2011‚Äì2012 enrollment: 432 students. ** Wells-Ogunquit Adult Community Education, located on the premises of Wells High School, provides adult education classes for adults of all ages. ===Closed=== * Ogunquit Village School provided classes for Ogunquit students in Kindergarten through fifth grade.

It requires the horse, while bent in the direction of the turn, to move his forehand around his hindquarters so that he makes a very small circle with the inside foreleg. The horse should pivot around a hindleg, as seen in the spin. Additionally, the horse should continue to display basic requirements of dressage, such as an even and regular rhythm, relaxation, acceptance of the aids, balance, and freedom of movement. ==Uses== The main purpose of the turn on the haunches is to introduce collection to the horse, as a movement to build collection, and as a stepping stone to the move advanced pirouette. It may also be used as a training movement to help with other problems, such as transitions into the canter, when used right before the transition. For the dressage horse, the movement is first asked for in the second level tests (USDF). The turn on the haunches is also important for jumping horses, before beginning the more difficult rollback turns. For the rider, the turn on the haunches can teach coordination of aids, as the rider must balance both the driving and restraining aids, as well as maintain the correct bend using the inside leg pushing into the outside aids. ==Asking for the turn== The turn on the haunches is usually performed as a turn that is 90 (quarter turn), 180 (half turn), or 360 degrees (full turn), although as a training movement to improve other work, the rider may adjust the number of steps as needed. Before asking for the movement, the horse should be forward and on the bit, maintaining rhythm and relaxation. When first introducing the turn to horse and rider, the aim should not be to perform it on the spot, but simply to maintain the rhythm of the walk and correct bend while keeping the horse active with his hind legs. Additionally, the rider should first begin with a few steps, such as on a quarter turn, rather than asking for a full 360 degrees right away. If the rider asks for too much too soon, it is likely that the horse will begin to lose important qualities as the turn proceeds, such as rhythm, bend, or activity behind. The rider should never sacrifice quality for quantity. To ask for the turn on the haunches, the rider must coordinate several aids at once. The outside leg prevents the hindquarters from swinging out, the outside rein maintains a correct bend to the inside, and helps to regulate the driving aids, telling the horse to turn rather than walk forward. The inside leg asks the horse to bend to the inside, pushes the energy into the outside aids, and keeps the activity of the hindquarters. The inside seatbone should be engaged, again to ask the horse to bend in the direction of the turn, and the inside rein should help lead the forehand around and also remind the horse to bend in the direction of the turn. ==Problems== Common problems with the turn on the haunches include pivoting on one leg, backing through the turn (it is a much lesser sin for the horse to be moving slightly forward and make a wider circle), and loss of rhythm, as well as an incorrect turn (such as doing a turn on the forehand or a turn on the center if the rider allows the hindquarters to swing out). The horse should also remain straight (i.e. correctly bent) through the turn, rather than overbent in the neck or tilting the head. If the horse steps backward, the rider should apply more inside leg, and may need to decrease the restraining aids. Horses that make a turn around the center, instead of the hindquarters, do so because the rider did not prevent the hindquarters from swinging out, and therefore more outside leg is needed. Horses that overbend in the neck and pop out the outside shoulder may do so because the rider is trying to pull the horse through the turn using the inside rein, rather than using the inside leg to keep the energy and the outside aids to push the energy around the circle. ==Variations== The turn on the haunches may also be performed in motion at the walk, trot, or canter. In this case, the hind legs produce a small circle. When the movement is made on a half-volte (6 meter circle) it is called a passade'. This movement is usually used as a step before the horse is asked for a pirouette, and also to improve turns for jumping courses.

It forms a conservation area that is mostly within the London Borough of Ealing, with a small part to the east within the London Borough of Hounslow. The nearest underground station is Turnham Green (District line), and the London bus routes 94 and E3 serve the district. ==History== Bedford Park has been described as the world's first garden suburb.Affleck Greeves, T. 1975 \\"Bedford Park, the First Garden Suburb\\", Jones; Bolsterli, M. 1977 \\"The Early Community at Bedford Park: 'Corporate Happiness' in the First Garden Suburb\\". Although it was not built in the co-operative manner like some later developments (Brentham Garden Suburb, Hampstead Garden Suburb), it created a model that was emulated not just by the Garden city movement, but by suburban developments around the world. Sir John Betjeman described Bedford Park \\"the most significant suburb built in the last century, probably in the western world\\". Herman Muthesius, the celebrated German critic who wrote The English House in 1904 said, \\"It signifies neither more nor less than the starting point of the smaller modern house, which spread from there over the whole country.\\" St Michael and All Angels An artist's cottage at Bedford Park, designed by the architect C.F.A. Voysey The developer was Jonathan Carr (brother of J. Comyns Carr), who in 1875 bought of land just north of Turnham Green Station in West London which had been constructed six years earlier. The City of London was only 30 minutes by steam train and the site was blessed with many fine trees. The desire to protect the mature trees led to the informal plan that is major feature of Bedford Park. The first architect for the estate was Edward William Godwin, a leading member of the Aesthetic Movement, but his plans came in for some criticism in The Builder, the leading professional journal of its day, and Godwin and Carr parted company. Some designs were commissioned from the firm of Coe and Robinson, but in 1877 Carr hired Richard Norman Shaw the leading architect of his day to be the Estate architect. By then the layout of the Park had been set but Shaw's house designs, in the Queen Anne style, proved remarkably successful in creating an impression of great variety whilst employing a limited number of house types. Living in Bedford Park, with its church, parish hall, club, stores, pub and school of art, was the height of fashion in the 1880s. W. B. Yeats, the actor William Terriss, the actress Florence Farr, the playwright Arthur Wing Pinero and the painter Camille Pissarro lived here. Bedford Park is Saffron Park in G. K. Chesterton‚Äôs The Man Who Was Thursday and Biggleswick in John Buchan‚Äôs Mr. Standfast. So fashionable did it become that Bedford Park came in for some gentle ribbing in the St James's Gazette in the \\"Ballad of Bedford Park\\". As the 20th century drew on, the place became less a centre of fashion; the houses were multi-occupied and bus conductors called out \\"Poverty Park\\" when they stopped on the Bath Road. The demolition by Acton Council of The Bramptons and its replacement by a five-storey old people's home led directly to the foundation in 1963 of the Bedford Park Society. Through the activities of the society, in 1967 the government listed the greater part of the estate, a total of 356 houses. A few years later both Ealing and Hounslow councils designated Bedford Park a conservation area. Since that time the area has gradually improved. Houses have returned to family use and many have been renovated. ==The Bedford Park Society== The society, a registered charity, was formed in 1963 by two local residents, Harry Taylor ‚Äì president of the South Acton Conservatives ‚Äì and architect Tom Greeves who lived in Newton Grove and was a founder member of the Victorian Society. Their concerns about the future of Bedford Park were united by the demolition of The Bramptons in Bedford Park to make way for an old people's home. Taylor became chairman, Greeves the secretary and John Betjeman the first patron. In the first year the society grew to 200 members who were exhorted not to make unsuitable improvements to their homes. However, Greeves was aware that the only real protection for the whole estate lay in getting the buildings statutorily listed. The breakthrough came in 1967 with the staging of a local exhibition Artists and Architecture of Bedford Park 1875‚Äì1900 which was visited by Arthur Grogan, a government inspector from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Through Grogan, 356 of Bedford Park's houses were Grade II listed and the London Borough of Ealing (in 1969) and the London Borough of Hounslow (in 1970) declared conservation areas for their half of the suburb. Tom Greeves, who as secretary was de facto leader of the society for many years, died in 1997. The society has successfully resisted demolition plans and has protected the general architectural quality of the estate and its surrounding area. The society's Log Book, which is issued to every listed house, helps owners learn about the history of their dwelling and how it should be maintained. The society reviews all planning applications and gives its views to the local authorities. The society's main role is to protect the amenity of the first garden suburb. It is not a residents' association, but it does get involved in more general issues such as parking and traffic where these have an environmental impact. ===Conservation area=== The Bedford Park conservation area stretches from Esmond Road in the west, to Abinger Road in the east, from Flanders Road in the South to Fielding Road in the north. Within the Conservation area planning permission is required for most new building work, alterations and extensions. Cladding, new dormer windows and the erection of satellite dishes all require permission. ===Listed buildings=== Most of the early buildings in Bedford Park are Grade II listed. This means that the whole building is protected, including the interiors, outhouses and boundary walls and fences. Listed building consent is required for any alterations, extensions, excavations and demolition. ===Trees=== All trees in the conservation area are protected and it is an offence to carry out works on a tree without written permission of the local council. ===Planning committee=== The Bedford Park Society is invited by the two local authorities to review all planning applications. The views of the society are taken into account when determining applications. Additionally, Ealing has a conservation area advisory committee which also comments on applications. ===Notable residents=== *Richard Briers, English sitcom actor, lived and died at 6 The Orchard. *Marie Ault, English actress of silent films, lived at 8 The Orchard. *John Lindley, English botanist, lived at Bedford House, The Avenue (which is now marked by a blue plaque). *Jo Grimond, English Liberal politician, lived at 24 Priory Avenue. *Cecil Aldin, English animal painter, lived at 47 Priory Avenue. *Sir Sydney Cockerell, English Fitzwilliam Museum curator, arts collector, lived at 5 Priory Gardens and at 3 Fairfax Road. * The Irish poet W.

This was a tramroad which linked with other earlier tramroads to form a continuous line between Hereford and Abergavenny. It was bought by the Newport, Abergavenny & Hereford Railway in 1846. ==Hereford, Hay & Brecon Railway== The Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway was incorporated in 1859. It opened between Hereford and Moorhampton to goods traffic on 24 October 1862, to Eardisley for goods and passengers on 30 June 1863 and reached Hay-on-Wye on 11 July 1864. Initially the company used the short-lived Moorfields station to the west of the city but later used Barton and then Barrs Court station. The railway was taken over by the Midland Railway in 1874. The line closed to passengers on 31 December 1962, and was shut finally in 1964. ==Hereford, Ross & Gloucester Railway== Incorporated in 1851. The final section from Hopesbrook to Hereford section opened 1 June 1855. It was a broad gauge track, linking eventually to London Paddington through a 22-mile section from the Grange Court Junction in the Forest of Dean and on the South Wales Railway. On 29 July 1862 the line was amalgamated with the GWR. In 1869 the line was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge in a 5-day period. As part of the Beeching cuts the Gloucester to Hereford line was closed on 2 November 1964. ==Leominster and Kington Railway== Incorporated in 1854, the Leominster and Kington Railway connected Leominster with Kington and Presteigne. Connecting to the Hay Railway via the Kington and Eardisley Railway at Titley Junction, a proposed plan to develop a cross-Wales line via New Radnor to Aberystwyth was never realised. Taken over by the West Midland Railway, it became a constituent part of the Great Western Railway. It was at its busiest during World War II, when RAF Shobdon acted as a casualty distribution centre to local hospitals for both the British and later United States Army. It closed to passenger traffic in 1955, and shut pre-Beeching in 1963. ==Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway== The Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway (NA&HR;) was incorporated in 1846, formed by the amalgamation of the Hereford Railway, the Llanfihangel Railway and the Grosmont Railway. A joint opening with the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway took place on 6 December 1853. The company was taken over by the West Midland Railway in 1860, which became part of the Great Western Railway in 1863. The main Hereford station and headquarters of the Newport to Hereford line was Hereford Barton railway station to the west of the city. There was a short link which continued northwards to the Shrewsbury & Hereford line at Barrs Court junction, allowing for through North-South services. Later, in 1866, a connecting line was built branching East from the NA&HR; to the south of the city from Red Hill, to Rotherwas on the Hereford Ross and Gloucester line which continued into Barrs Ct. Station. This enabled NA&HR; trains to use Barrs Court station. Barton station was closed to passengers on 2 January 1893, with all services transferred to Barrs Coutt (the current Hereford station). Barton station was demolished in 1913, although facilities there remained open for freight until 1979. The through route from Red Hill to Barrs Court Junction, passing through Barton, remained open until around this time as a goods only line, avoiding the busy Barrs Court passenger station. ==Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway== The Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway was incorporated in 1846. The Hereford section of the line officially opened at Barrs Court station on 6 December 1853, although the line had been used for goods traffic since the earlier in the year. It was leased jointly by the London & North Western Railway and GWR from 1862 and was transferred to joint ownership in 1868. ==Worcester and Hereford Railway== Incorporated in 1853. This railway was opened by the Worcester and Hereford Railway in stages from 1859 to 1861 with the final section Malvern Wells to Shelwick Junction (Hereford) opened on 17 September 1861. Midland Railway and the London and North Western Railway both collaborated in the line - the solicitor, Samuel Carter, was also solicitor to both of these major companies. The Worcester and Hereford Railway became part of the West Midland Railway on 1 July 1861 and the GWR on 1 August 1863. ==West Midland Railway== Incorporated in 1860. This was originally the Oxford Worcester & Wolverhampton Railway. It changed its name in 1860 and absorbed the Newport Abergavenny & Hereford plus the Worcester & Hereford. It also had agreements to work or leases on numerous branch lines in the English West Midlands region. The West Midland Railway's independent life was very short. It was leased to the GWR in 1861 and amalgamated with it in 1863. ==References== A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Volume 13 - Thames and Severn. Rex Christiansen. 1981.

His father gave him the County of Rouergue and Quercy in 906 and he governed it to his death. His brother was Raymond II of Toulouse and together they governed the vast patrimony of their house in the first half of the tenth century. In 930, he donated property to the abbey of Vabres in a charter dated to the seventh year of King Rudolph bearing only the title of comes (count). In January 932, he made a similar donation with the title of princeps (prince). He was probably regarded as princeps Gothiae, a title which was to run in his family in the tenth century. He and his nephew Raymond Pons of Toulouse, together with Sancho IV of Gascony, went to the court of Rudolph that year to do homage for their lands.Flodoard gives this duke as Lupus Aznar Vasco, but Lewis, 184n, takes this as a reference to a duke of Gascony named S√°nchez. This did not have the desired effect, however, of satisfying royal desires for influence in the south and Rudolph accompanied Ebalus of Aquitaine against the Vikings a short while later, strengthening the Ramnulfid dynasty against that of the Rouergue in the fight for supremacy in Aquitaine.Lewis, 187. Ermengol and his wife Adelais (Adalaiz) had two known sons and one daughter, though charters of his eldest son indicate that he had other sons besides his two heirs. The eldest son was Raymond, who inherited Rouergue, and the second was Hugh, who received Quercy.

Modified ailerons produce a substantially improved roll response compared to the previous model. Approach control is by top surface Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes. The G103A Twin II Acro variant features strengthened mainspar caps and steel control pushrods which permit greater aerobatic performance. The G103 also has a FAA approved modification kit for all-hand control for handicapped operation.

Grob completed further investigations into the effects of certain flight conditions on the fuselage structure and the development of corrective procedures. Further static strength tests were conducted to verify the safety margin of the fuselage. The results of these tests restored the original flight speed limitations and maneuver operations for the Twin II and allowed the Twin II Acro only basic aerobatic maneuvers (spins, lazy eights, chandelles, stall turns, steep turns, and positive loops).

Until 1989 it was officially the newspaper for the Norwegian Labour Party. ==HistoryBorn from party split=== The newspaper was born as a consequence of the split of the Labour Party in the fall of 1923. Unlike in most of the country, there was a Communist majority in the local party organisation in Trondheim, and the newly formed Norwegian Communist Party, secured the party's assets, including the party newspaper Ny Tid, established in 1899. Among the most known staff in Ny Tid was Martin Tranm√¶l. The Labour Party in Trondheim prioritised the work to establish a new newspaper, and at the annual meeting it created an extra member fee for the purpose. A new newspaper was published on 15 March 1924 under the name Arbeider-Avisen - organ for the Norwegian Labour Party. The paper had its headquarters in Trondheim. Within the party many regarded the newspaper as a direct succession of Ny Tid. Tr√∏ndelag Social-Demokrat, established by the Social Democratic Labour who had left the Labour Party during the first party split in 1917, was merged into Arbeider-Avisen in 1927. At the same time, the Social Democrats were merged into Labour. Later the newspaper Folkets Rett in Levanger was merged with Arbeider-Avisen, making it a pan-Tr√∏ndelag newspaper. In 1939 Ny Tid lost the struggle against Arbeider- Avisen and became defunct. Arbeider-Avisen had prospered after the cabinet Nygaardsvold, led by Johan Nygaardsvold from Tr√∏ndelag, assumed national office. ===Stopped during the war=== During World War II and the German occupation of Norway the entire media environment in Trondheim changed. At the start of the war the city had four daily newspapers, the largest being Dagsposten (15,000 issues) followed by the conservative Adresseavisen (15,000 issues), Arbeider-Avisen (10,000 issues) and the liberal Nidaros (10,000 issues). Arbeider-Avisen continued to come out during the war, but soon met problems. In article and editorials there were clear stands in cases that were in conflict with the German interests, resulting in that the newspaper was stopped for shorter or longer periods. The first such stop occurred on 30 August 1940 and the newspaper was stopped for six days. The punishment came after a small notice from a municipal council debate in Leksvik under the title \\"Someone who doesn't give up\\". Under the real message was added: \\"We have taken under doubt to increase the line distance so the readers better can read between the lines\\". The final stop order came on 29 January 1941 when German and Norwegian police met up at Adresseavisen's printing press where Arbeider-Avisen was printed and wrecked the printed pages with a sledgehammer. The three other Trondheim newspapers barely mentioned the event with a small notice from central authorities: \\"Arbeider-Avisen has lately repeatedly published articles and messages that only has had the intention of giving an unwanted influence on the newspaper's readers, and by that evading civil obedience, at the same time it is damaging the work that Norwegian and German authorities are conducting in cooperation. The stop was intended to last only four weeks, but instead lasted throughout the entire war. The newspaper's editor Harald Langhelle was in October 1942 arrested and executed as one of ten after a sabotage at Fosdalen Mines in Malm. ===The end of the war=== When the peace came on 8 May 1945, Trondheims-Pressen was launched, a common newspaper created by Adresseavisen, Arbeider-Avisen and Nidaros. It was produced at Adresseavisen after press from the resistance, who wanted to avoid to much unfair competition because of the many newspapers that were stopped during the war. But on 14 May the ordinary newspapers were back on the street, each with about 30,000 issues. Dagsposten was not part of the project, the newspaper had voluntarily been nazified during the war and did not survive the peace. The Christian Dagsavisa was established in the ruins of Dagsposten and survived about ten years. In light of communisms newgained popularity Ny Tid was published again for two years, before being closed again. Adresseavisen had during the war taken over both advertisers and subscribers who had fled from Dagsposten. While Adresseavisen and to a certain extent Nidaros had intact production equipment, Arbeider-Avisa stated with nothing. Not even a pencil was left after the Germany occupants had cleansed the offices. But thanks to hard work from former employees and not least the labour unions, the newspaper could again start production, layout and printed at Adresseavisen, with Ole √òisang back as editor. Adresseavisen was convicted, as part of the newspaper trials after the war, to pay a compansation of NOK 600,000 to all newspapers. Despite this, it didn't take many days after the war to see that Adresseavisen had won the newspaper war. In 1947 Arbeider-Avisa (21.400) had half the number of subscribers as Adresseavisen (41.000). ===Post-war=== After the war Arbeider-Avisa had three major developments. The number of issues fell, costs exceeding income and the removal of the church journalism. In 1964 the newspaper merged with Namdal Arbeiderblad in the company A/S Tr√∏nderpresse and some time later with Stj√∏rdalens Blad to strengthen the economy, something that also happened. The two other newspapers were demerged in the 1970s and 90s respectively. Arbeider-Avisa was an innovative newspaper when it came to technology. Early in the 1970s it converted to tabloid format at the same time it started printing in offset at its own press. In 1974 it became a morning newspaper, but this was not a success since Adresseavisen was well established in the morning market. In the middle of the 1980s the newspaper was one of the first in Norway were the journalists wrote the articles directly into computers. Only once, in 1971, has the newspaper been close to the target issue number of 20,000, right before the 1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum. Editor Eigil Gullv√•g took a stand for Norwegian EEC membership, unlike most of the opinion in Central Norway and among the newspapers readers and the growth was changed to decline. Norsk Arbeiderpresse (now A-Pressen) went into the ownership of Arbeider-Avisa in the late 1980s and declared the newspaper a priority area, but neither this put an end to the rumours of an imminent death. Editor Terje Dalen lead the first dramatic cut- back and 30 prosent of the employees had to quit in 1989. After 45 years in Folkets Hus in Midtbyen Arbeider-Avisa moved the offices and press to a new building in Lade in 1990 under leadership of editor Bj√∏rn Stuevold. In Folkets Hus in the city centre the offices had grown so much it had been in four floors, connected through labyrinths of corridors. ===Last years=== In 1993 the newspaper changed name to Avisa Trondheim at the same time it moved back to the city centre. On the owner side there had been a small revolution as Student Welfare Organisation in Trondheim (SiT) and Norske Aller became coowners of the multimedia corporation Tr√∏ndelag Avis og Kringkasting through a cooperation with Radio 1 and Norsk Arbeiderpresse. A major refinancing was to insure the newspaper a good economy without debt. As part of the agreement SiT was to buy between 2,000 and 3,000 subscriptions and give these onwards to its students, an agreement that met large resistance among the students and was quickly abolished. A refinancing in the fall of 1994 was successful, where the competitor Adresseavisen was part. The year later all the employees in the newspaper were fired and asked to apply to new jobs in the newspaper in an attempt to reduce the number of employees and save money. But the losses continued, among others because of the reduction in sold newspapers. Just at the end of the newspapers life the owners in A-Pressen asked Adresseavisen if they wanted joint ownership in the company, but before they answered A-Pressen declared the newspaper bankrupt. The last issue came out on 27 February 1996 with 11,036 issues. Repeated attempts to start again failed. But after the bankruptcy was processed most of the creditors got their assets back. Arbeiderbladet bought the subscriber list while the Norwegian Labour Movement Archives and Library bought the archive. ===Revival as Arbeideravisa=== In January 2008, the newspaper resumed publication under the name Arbeideravisa. However, it only lasted until August the same year. ==Editors== * Hjalmar Waage 1924‚Äì1925 * Ole √òisang 1925‚Äì1940 * Harald Langhelle 1940‚Äì1942 * Ole √òisang 1945‚Äì1958 * Eigil Gullv√•g 1958‚Äì1983 * Terje Dalen 1983‚Äì1990 * Bj√∏rn Stuevold 1990‚Äì1992 * Randi Rassmussen 1992‚Äì1995 * Torgeir Winnberg 1995‚Äì1996 ==References== Category:1924 establishments in Norway Category:1996 disestablishments in Norway Category:Defunct newspapers published in Norway Category:Mass media in Trondheim Category:Norwegian-language newspapers Category:Publications established in 1924 Category:Publications disestablished in 1996 Category:Publications established in 2008 Category:Publications disestablished in 2008 Category:Socialist newspapers ","title":"Arbeider-Avisa"},{"id":"9151514","text":"Louis-Charles Malassez Bust of Louis-Charles Malassez, on his grave.

He studied medicine in Paris, where he worked as an interne from 1867. He served with the 5th Ambulance Corps during the Franco-Prussian War, afterwards returning to Paris, where he worked with distinguished physicians that included Claude Bernard, Jean-Martin Charcot and Pierre Potain. In 1875, he attained the chair of anatomy at Coll√®ge de France, and in 1894, became a member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine. He conducted histological research of the blood, and is credited for design of the hemocytometer, a device used to quantitatively measure blood cells. In the field of dentistry, he described residual cells of the epithelial root sheath in the periodontal ligament. These remaining cells are referred to as epithelial cell rests of Malassez (ERM). A genus of fungi called Malassezia bears his name. The species in the genus include: Malassezia furfur, Malassezia ovalis, Malassezia pachydermatis, Malassezia sympodialis and Malassezia orbiculare. Malassezia furfur is a lipophilic species that forms on human skin and can cause seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor, Malassezia pachydermatis is a species that is associated with otitis externa in dogs. == Selected publications == * 'De la num√©ration des globules rouges du sang.

Haunches-in, also called travers or t√™te au mur (\\"head to the wall\\" in French), is a lateral movement used in the dressage discipline of horse training. It has a close cousin, haunches-out, renvers, or croupe au mur (\\"rump to the wall\\"), that is slightly more difficult. Both movements are four-track, meaning they produce four lines of hoof prints in the sand, as opposed to the usual two seen if the horse is straight and to the three-track shoulder-in. In haunches-in, the horse bends its hindquarters slightly to the inside of the arena, away from the arena wall, so that the horse is bent in the direction of movement. The front legs and shoulders should not move from the original track. This produces the four tracks, with the outer track made by the outside foreleg, the second track by the inside foreleg, the third track by the outside hind leg, and the inside track made by the inside hind leg. In haunches-out (renvers), the horse is similarly bent in the direction of movement, but the hindquarters are bent toward the arena wall instead of away from it. This produces a four-track movement consisting of the outside track made by the outside hind leg, the second track by the inside hind leg, the third track by the outside foreleg and the inside track by the inside foreleg. This movement is considered to be more difficult than travers. A horse that naturally moves with its haunches slightly to the inside is simply travelling crooked, and is not performing haunches-in. These horses usually lack correct bend through the whole body, do not work properly into their outside aids, and do not show the same engagement or balance seen in horses ridden in a true haunches-in. ==Uses of travers and renvers== Both movements are used in dressage training, as they encourage collection from the horse, help to produce impulsion, can be used to supple the horse and make him more responsive to the aids, and help to strengthen the hindquarters. Additionally, travers is a stepping stone to the more advanced half-pass,\\"As travers is the preliminary exercise to half-pass, be prepared to accept less angle and more bend and establish easy and flowing steps.\\" Davison, p. 55. and goes together with the turn on the haunches, which also asks the horse to move in the direction of bend. Renvers (haunches-out) is a good exercise to counteract the tendency of many horses to travel crookedly. It is employed by the Spanish Riding School, due to their belief that travers encourages the horse to travel crookedly with their haunches leaning toward the center of the arena. Renvers therefore provides all the benefits of travers, without any of the drawbacks. ==Riding the Travers and Renvers== When first introducing the movement, the rider begins with haunches-in, as it is slightly easier. It is generally helpful to have begun other simple lateral movements, such as the leg-yield to teach the horse the concept of moving away from the leg, advancing to the shoulder-in to introduce the three-track movement. It is generally easier to perform the haunches-in if the horse first performs a 10-meter circle before moving into the movement, as the small circle gets the horse correctly bent to the degree needed for haunches-in. The rider should perform slightly less than one full circle, so that the forehand returns to the track while the hindquarters are still slightly to the inside, before asking the horse to move down the long side of the arena. Like all lateral movements, it is best to begin with a few steps of haunches-in when first teaching it, asking for quality rather than quantity. Additionally, the rider should ask for only a slight bend to the inside, before increasing the degree of bend (and thus difficulty) as the horse progresses. After performing the movement, the horse should be asked to move straight ahead and forward. To ask for the haunches in, the rider uses the outside leg to guide the horse's hindquarters from the track, and the rider's hips and upper body mirrors the axis of the horse's hips and shoulders. The rider's outside leg is used behind the neutral position to controls the outside hind leg of the horse, keeping it inward from the track and under the horse's body. This both encourages and requires collection and impulsion in this movement. The rider's outside rein maintains the connection, preventing the horse from swinging the shoulders to the outside and straightening its spine, maintaining the energy produced by the horse's outside hind leg. The rider's inside leg asks the horse to bend in the direction of movement and to maintain forward motion and rhythm. The inside rein used to keep the horse looking in the direction of travel and maintain bend. Renvers is slightly more difficult because the arena wall is not in a position to guide the horse's shoulders and requires the horse to be consistently and correctly on the aids. The movement quickly identifies a rider who uses the wall as a crutch. When moving along the wall of the arena, the horse's shoulders move toward the inside and the horse remains bent in the direction of movement. Renvers may be asked for through a pessade (small half- circle), to help position the horse properly. It may also be asked after going across the diagonal in half-pass, and then positioning the horse once it reaches the arena wall, instead of straightening. ==Notes== ==Sources== * Richard Davison, Dressage Priority Points, Howell Book House, New York 1995, * Jenny Loriston-Clarke, The Complete Guide to Dressage.

First opened in 1939, it is located near the summit of Logan Canyon in the Bear River Mountains, west of Bear Lake and near the border with Idaho. While smaller and less developed than a number of Utah ski resorts, Beaver Mountain is very popular with residents of nearby Logan, Utah State University, the surrounding Cache Valley, and the Bear Lake region, including southeastern Idaho. The slopes of the mountain are predominantly east-facing, and it receives somewhat less snowfall than those resorts facing west. Since it does not currently employ snowmaking equipment, the ski area is entirely dependent upon the (usually) ample natural snowfall, and therefore often opens several weeks later than most other resorts in Utah. \\"The Beav\\" is located northeast of Logan, just a mile (1.6 km) off of US-89, the Logan Canyon Scenic Byway, a national scenic byway. Garden City, Utah is the closest town, which is about ten to fifteen minutes away. The Idaho border (42nd parallel) is less than north and Bear Lake is approximately due east. Salt Lake City is south. The ski area is owned and operated by the Seeholzer family: founded by Harry (1902‚Äì1968) and succeeded by son it continues as a family operation under Ted's son Travis. == Facilities == Facilities at Beaver include a day lodge with grill restaurant, a full-service ski rental operation and a ski shop. While alpine skiing and snowboarding are the most popular activities, there is a dedicated area for Nordic (cross-country) skiers near the base. == Lifts == The Little Beaver Lift (a triple chairlift) serves primarily beginner terrain. Originally a double chair, it became a triple in 2011; the new lift adds about 100 yards to the run, by incorporating an area previously served by a rope tow, the other runs originating from the top of the Little Beaver Lift include \\"Little Beaver,\\" \\"Tiny Tim,\\" and access to the \\"Goat Trail\\" cat track, from which access can be had to the \\"Beaver Face Lift\\" and \\"Harry's Dream Lift,\\" further up the slope. The Beaver's Face Lift (double) serves only intermediate and advanced runs. The first chairlift on the mountain, it began operating in late 1961. It offers access to intermediate and expert terrain. Harry's Dream Lift (triple) was originally a double chair, installed in the fall of 1969. Already slated for replacement, a failed bearing in March 2006 closed the lift for the balance of the season. Over that summer and fall, the entire lift was replaced by a more modern triple chair. It unloads near the summit, with fabulous views of the surrounding countryside; all types of terrain served are served, and it also provides the only way to access the base of Marge's Triple Lift (q.v.). The lift is named for founder Harold Seeholzer, who died of cancer in 1968, the year prior to its installation.Beaver Mountain - history - accessed 2010-03-05 Marge's Triple Lift provides access to a half-dozen intermediate and advanced runs, as well as the larger of two terrain parks on the mountain. It can only be accessed by taking the Harry‚Äôs Dream Lift. Marge is the daughter-in-law of the founder, married to his second son, Ted. The couple has owned the area since 1997; Ted was previously the general manager and Marge handled ticket sales. ==ReferencesSki Utah.com - Beaver Mountain Category:Sports venues in Cache County, Utah Category:Ski areas and resorts in Utah Category:Event venues established in 1939 Category:1939 establishments in Utah ","title":"Beaver Mountain"},{"id":"9151551","text":"St Oswald's Church is a Church of England parish church in Sowerby, North Yorkshire, England.

The fine south doorway was probably built in the eleventh century and most of the stone work in the south wall of the nave is of medieval date. The tower, which contains the remains of the Norman church, was built in the fifteenth century with a hagioscope through which the altar is seen. In 1842, the church was restored and enlarged in nineteenth century Norman style. In 1883, further restoration and repair included the erection of an open Lantern of woodwork surmounted by a slated spire above the chancel crossing. In 1902, the north wall was taken down and made into an arcade and a spacious north aisle built. In the 1980s, re-ordering of the church took place including adding a free-standing altar to allow more intimate congregational worship. The church was Grade II* listed in 1966. The churchyard contains two Commonwealth war graves, of a Royal Air Force boy airman of the First World War and a Royal Armoured Corps soldier of the Second World War. ==Gallery== Norman Doorway at St Oswalds Sowerby - geograph.org.uk - 561891.jpg  Norman doorway The Font of St Oswalds, Sowerby ^2 - geograph.org.uk - 561915.jpg  The font The Altar and Chancel Crossing of St Oswalds Sowerby - geograph.org.uk - 561948.jpg  Chancel with altar ==References== ==External links== *St Oswald's Parish Church, Sowerby Sowerby, St Oswald's Church Category:Diocese of York Category:Grade II* listed churches in North Yorkshire ","title":"St Oswald's Church, Sowerby"},{"id":"9151558","text":"Mexican Flora and Fauna Protection Areas (√Åreas de Protecci√≥n de Flora y Fauna in Spanish) comprise 29 protected natural areas of Mexico administrated by the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas, or CONANP), an agency of the federal government.

The truth about these claims is highly doubtful, accounts being usually based on only one questionable source. The American literary scholar Roger Shattuck called this kind of research study \\"The Forbidden Experiment\\" because of the exceptional deprivation of ordinary human contact it requires. Although not designed to study language, similar experiments on non-human primates (labelled the \\"Pit of despair\\") utilising complete social deprivation resulted in serious psychological disturbances. ==In history== Throughout history, several rulers have claimed to have carried out this kind of experiment although most accounts seem to be myths: An early record of a study of this kind can be found in Herodotus's Histories. According to Herodotus (ca. 485 - 425 BE), the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik I (664 - 610 BE, i.e. 200 years before Herodotus) carried out such a study, and concluded the Phrygian race must antedate the Egyptians since the child had first spoken something similar to the Phrygian word bekos, meaning \\"bread\\".Herodotus, History II:2, found in \\"An Account of Egypt\\".

The experiments were recorded by the monk Salimbene di Adam in his Chronicles, who was generally extremely negative about Fredrick II (portraying his calamaties as parallel to the Biblical plagues in The Twelve Calamities of Emperor Frederick II) and wrote that Frederick encouraged \\"foster-mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children, but in no ways to prattle or speak with them; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the Hebrew language (which he took to have been the first), or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born. But he laboured in vain, for the children could not live without clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and blandishments.\\"Medieval Sourcebook: Salimbene: On Frederick II, 13th Century A long time after Frederick II's alleged experiment, James IV of Scotland was said to have sent two children to be raised by a mute woman isolated on the island of Inchkeith, to determine if language was learned or innate. The children were reported to have spoken good Hebrew, but historians were skeptical of these claims soon after they were made.Dalyell, John Graham, ed., The Chronicles of Scotland by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, vol. 1, Edinburgh (1814) pp. 249-250. Mughal emperor Akbar was later said to have children raised by mute wetnurses. Akbar held that speech arose from hearing; thus children raised without hearing human speech would become mute.M.

His authored works relate his belief that thinking is only the prelude to doing. This belief, combined with his passionate advocacy of freedom and self-government has naturally led to his conviction that civil society is something good and also simple to explain: i.e. the way to have a decent country is to ensure that it functions bottom- up, and that everyone gets involved and represented in the decisions about the common future. Officially a resident of the village of Mindya, in the Balkan mountain range, he established the CSP-NBU in 1994 and has led it ever since. He teaches political philosophy and social practices at the New Bulgarian University. He also regularly testifies in parliamentary hearings.

It takes advantage of the fact that two components of image noise, dark current and fixed-pattern noise, are the same from shot to shot. Noise from the image sensor include hot pixels, which light up more brightly than surrounding pixels. The technique works by taking a picture with the shutter closed and subtracting that electronically from the original photo exhibiting the noise. Dark-frame subtraction has been applied to the left half of the image. The right half is directly from the image sensor. A dark frame is an image captured with the sensor in complete darkness (i.e. with a closed shutter or the lens and viewfinder capped). Such a dark frame is essentially an image of noise produced by the sensor. A dark frame, or an average of several dark frames, can then be subtracted from subsequent images to correct for fixed-pattern noise. It is important that dark frames are taken at the same ISO sensitivity and exposure time as the original photo, because the brightness of fixed pixel noise is dependent on both. Under these circumstances, a single dark frame can be subtracted from multiple photos taken at these parameters, amounting to a time saving and allowing noise reduction for stacked star trail images, which do not allow interruption. Dark-frame subtraction is also used in digital photogrammetry, to improve the contrast of satellite and air photograms, and is considered a best practice, along with flat-field correction, for astrophotography. == Software support == Notable software that supports dark-frame subtraction includes: * dcraw with \`-K \` * RawTherapee * UFRaw with \`--darkframe=\` ==See also== * Bias frame ==References== Category:Astrophotography Category:Digital photography Category:Image noise reduction techniques Category:Photogrammetry Category:Photographic techniques ","title":"Dark-frame subtraction"},{"id":"9151868","text":"A lenslet is literally a small lens.

The bark is orange-brown weathering greyish, smooth at first, becoming fissured and exfoliating in long strips on the lower trunk on old trees. The foliage is produced in flattened sprays with scale-like leaves 1.5‚Äì8 mm long; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. The upper side of the foliage sprays is green without stomata, the underside is marked with dense patches of white stomata. The seed cones are 10‚Äì15 mm long, pale purple with a whitish wax coating, with four (rarely six) scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; the outer pair of scales each bears two winged seeds, the inner pair(s) usually being sterile; the cones are borne on a 4‚Äì6 mm long peduncle covered in small (2 mm) scale leaves. The cones turn brown when mature about 8 months after pollination. The pollen cones are 4‚Äì5 mm long. ==Variety species== It is very similar to Calocedrus macrolepis, and some botanists treat it as a variety of that, C. macrolepis var. formosana. They differ most obviously in the longer cone stem, 10‚Äì20 mm long, of C. macrolepis. ==Threats== The species has a very limited native range of less than 5,000 km¬≤, and is threatened by over-harvesting for its valuable wood and conversion of natural forest to plantations of faster- growing exotic species. Some areas are now protected in reserves, and a limited amount of replanting is taking place, but an overall decline continues.

Built by Supermarine at Woolston, the S.4 was primarily an all-wooden monoplane seaplane, although a mixed wood-metal construction fuselage was mated to an unbraced cantilever wing and monocoque fuselage, powered by a 680 hp (507 kW) Napier Lion VII engine. As an exceptionally \\"clean\\" monoplane seaplane, the S.4 design was in marked contrast to the biplane Supermarine Sea Lion flying boats which Mitchell had designed for previous Schneider Trophy races, which won in 1922 and came third behind the American Curtiss CR seaplanes in 1923.Green 1967, p. 744. ==Operational history== Registered G-EBLP,Jackson 1988, p. 317. the S.4 first flew on 24 August 1925.Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 175.

Hurricane engineering is a relatively new and emerging discipline within the field of civil engineering. It is an integration of many recognized branches of engineering, such as structural engineering, wind engineering, coastal engineering, and forensic engineering, with other recognized sciences and planning functions such as, climatology, oceanography, architecture, emergency management and preparedness, hazard mitigation, and hazard vulnerability analysis. Hurricane engineering aims to minimize risks to human safety, the natural and built environment, and business processes. As a result of the tremendous threats to life safety and economic disruptions caused by the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, governmental organizations, such as the United States National Science Foundation, have recognized the need to better understand hurricane threats and further establish this discipline. In September 2006, the National Science Board released recommendations to the United States Congress calling for major new investments in hurricane science and engineering. Accredited university engineering programs, such as the Louisiana State University civil engineering department and University of Notre Dame Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences, are establishing programs to better understand these catastrophic storms and their interaction with the environment. The LSU Hurricane Center has begun to offer hurricane engineering courses with the focus of educating students on the unique threats caused by hurricanes. In the Northwest Pacific, where the term for strong tropical cyclones is Typhoon, the concept of Typhoon Engineering, which is very similar to Hurricane Engineering, is being proposed. The past two decades have witnessed exponential growth in damage due to hurricanes and the situation continues to deteriorate. The most vulnerable areas, coastal counties along the Gulf and Atlantic seaboards, are experiencing greater population growth and development than anyplace else in the country. If the trend of rapidly increasing losses caused by hurricanes is to be reversed, a whole new philosophy of understanding, planning, and preparedness is required. The Hurricane Engineering curriculum is the result of a multidisciplinary project aimed at giving engineering students a comprehensive understanding of the hazards associated with hurricanes: *Extreme winds *Windborne debris *Storm surges *River flooding *Rain-induced landslides ==References== * * == External links == * NSF Hurricane Engineering and Science Recommendations * American Society of Civil Engineers: papers and articles about hurricane analysis, response and mitigation * LSU Hurricane Engineering curriculum development Category:Environmental engineering ","title":"Hurricane engineering"},{"id":"9152240","text":"Michael Kpakala Francis in 1992 Michael Kpakala Francis (born 12 February 1936 ‚Äì 19 May 2013) was a Liberian prelate of the Catholic Church who led the Apostolic Vicariate of Monrovia from 1976 to 1981 and then served as the first Archbishop of the newly established Archdiocese of Monrovia from 1981 to 2011. ==Biography== Michael Kpakala Francis was born on 12 February 1936 in Kakata District, Liberia. He was ordained a priest on 4 August 1963. On 28 October 1976, Pope John Paul II appointed him titular bishop of Ausuccura and Apostolic Vicar of Monrovia. He received his episcopal consecration on 19 December 1976 from his predecessor, Francis Carroll. On 19 December 1981, Pope John Paul appointed him the first Archbishop of the newly created Archbishop of Monrovia. He suffered a stroke in 2004 that left him paralyzed and unable to speak, confined to a wheelchair. Andrew J. Karnley was named apostolic administrator to help manage the affairs of the Archdiocese. Pope Benedict XVI accepted his resignation on 12 February 2011. He was the first priest and bishop to institute the Catholic Justice and Peace Council (J.P.C.) in Liberia. This council was organized to defend human rights and civil liberty in the war-ravaged country under then-President Charles Taylor. In 1996, after the famous 6 April fracas in Monrovia, the bishop decided to close all Catholic schools because he felt Catholic institutions (including Radio Veritas) were targeted by fighters loyal to Taylor. The bishop later reconsidered his decision in 1997, after a public outcry. He died on 19 May 2013. Francis was a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1999, given each year to an individual whose courageous activism is at the heart of the human rights movement and in the spirit of Robert F.

Keteleeria evelyniana grows in Vietnam at elevations above and is shade intolerant, prefers neutral soils, and is typically associated with Pinus spp. or with species of Fagaceae and Lauraceae. It is the most widespread conifer in NW Vietnam. ==Cultivation and uses== Timber is insect resistant and is useful for construction and household furniture making. Used in construction, railroad ties, mine timbering and sundry house implements. The seeds are rich in essential oil that can be used for burning and soap manufacturing. The tree can also be used in medicine. In mid-December 2009, a Keteleeria evelyniana located in Seattle's Washington Park Arboretum was cut down. It was thought that the unknown person who was responsible for the cutting down of the tree took it for a Christmas tree. The tree was planted in 1998, transplanted from China's Yunnan province. In 2013, the species was listed as vulnerable on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species after a 2010 assessment which found the tree's population to be in significant decline and fragmented.

Although his surname was actually Melcarne, he was referred to by his home town , a small town in the Province of Lecce. He worked as a singer at the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, as a maestro di cappella at Fano and at Ancona. His earliest extant work was published in Florence in 1606.Carter and Walker His guitar book Nuova inventione d'intavolatura per sonare li balletti sopra la Chitarra Spagniuola is the earliest to have been printed using alphabet notation of chords for rasgueado playing a five-course guitar. This had been in use in Italy and possibly Spain for some time before 1606. Montesardo does not claim to have invented this form of notation. His 'Nuova inventione' refers to his system for indicating the metre and note values with which the music is played. This involves using upper case and lower case letters to represent the minim and the crotchet respectively. A dot after the letter has the same function as it does is modern staff notation; it increases the value of the note by half its original value. This style of music printed in alfabeto became very popular in Italy during the 17th century. Nuova inventione includes versions of some of the most popular dance-songs and harmonic patterns of the time, including the Ruggiero, bergamasca, folia, and Ballo del gran duca, and was the first Italian publication to include the ciaccone and passacaglias. In terms of original music, Montesardo mainly composed polyphonic sacred music and madrigals. Montesardo also experimented with monody and published a collection of monody, which included his own experiments and works by Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini. He may be the same person as Gervasio Melcarne (Geruasio), two of whose madrigals appear in Pomponio Nenna's eighth book of madrigals for five voices (1618) alongside madrigals by Nenna and Carlo Gesualdo. == References == * Thomas Walker and Tim Carter. \\"Girolamo Montesardo\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

Scanning original proofs from a 1939 edition of Abraham Lincoln kept at Yale University, the publishers wished to recapture the richness and subtlety of the original illustrations.

The Senior School provides secondary education for 350 boys and girls aged 11‚Äì18. There are 150 children aged 4‚Äì11 in the Junior School and the Nursery has places for 16 children aged 3‚Äì4. Founded by the Augustinian friars in 1951, it is one of the network of Augustinian schools in other parts of the world and welcomes pupils of all denominations. ==History== At the request of the Diocese of Lancaster, the Order of Saint Augustine founded Austin Friars School, a day and boarding grammar school, to provide a Catholic education for boys in Cumbria and the city of Carlisle. The property was originally used by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart who had founded a school there before leaving for Newcastle upon Tyne in 1903 (and subsequently establishing Sacred Heart Catholic High School) and the Poor Sisters of Nazareth who ran an orphanage. It was then acquired by the Augustinians in 1951 and has been occupied by the school ever since.Carlisle Encyclopaedia - A Girls were admitted in 1986. Boarding ceased in 1998 due to declining interest. St Monica's, a coeducational junior school, was founded by parents as an independent charity when St Gabriel's closed. It was relocated to the same site as Austin Friars in 1985. The two schools legally merged in 2003 and renamed to Austin Friars St Monica's School. It became a trust after the last Augustinian priest, Father Bernard Rolls, who had himself been a pupil at the school, left for another assignment in 2005. Since then, the school has been operated entirely by lay staff and board of governors. It maintains its Catholic ethos and religious character.Our History In September 2015, the School was renamed as 'Austin Friars'. ==Houses== The school has three houses: Clare, Lincoln and Stafford. Determination of the house a pupil belongs to is random apart from when a relative (most usually a sibling) has previously belonged to a house. Each house has associated House Captains (usually one boy and one girl), along with a Head Boy and Head Girl (School Captains) and their Deputies that can be chosen from any house. Prefects are expected to perform various duties such as monitoring hallways etc. There is a voting system where each form group will receive a list of candidates to be house captain or school captain. Each year the School produces a musical or play and termly concerts are held in the School's Chapel. There are regular visits to theatres, concerts and galleries and school visits to the continent. The School Charities Committee also produces a very successful Fashion Show with proceeds supporting the work of Eden Valley Hospice (Jigsaw Children's Hospice) and Hospice at Home (Carlisle & North Lakeland). The school donates at least ¬£10000 to local, national and international charities each year. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Profile on the Independent Schools Council website * Augustinian Province of England and Scotland Category:Independent schools in Cumbria Category:Schools in Carlisle, Cumbria Category:Augustinian schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1951 Category:Roman Catholic independent schools in the Diocese of Lancaster Category:1951 establishments in England ","title":"Austin Friars"},{"id":"9152612","text":"The Rooster Crows: A Book of American Rhymes and Jingles, written and illustrated by Maud and Miska Petersham, is a 1945 picture book published by Simon & Schuster.

He was working as a fruiterer's assistant when he was called up for the Australian Citizens Military Forces (CMF), the militia, in May 1942.Greville, 2000 == Military career == Madden was initially posted to the 114th Australian General Hospital in Goulburn, New South Wales. As part of the CMF, he was not required to serve outside of Australia or its territories, but despite this he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force in August 1943. Nicknamed 'Slim' due to his lean build, Madden saw service with the 8th Field Ambulance in New Guinea, during which he contracted malaria.Ashcroft, 2010, pp.249251 He later served with the 5th Motor Ambulance Convoy Platoon on Bougainville and was part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan after the war. He was eventually discharged from the army in June 1947. After leaving the army, Madden took up work at a mental hospital. Two months after the Korean War broke out, he reenlisted with the Australian Army for service as a private in Korea. Initially assigned to 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) for duty as a driver, he later volunteered for signalling duties. In April 1951, the Chinese attacked the regiment's positions near Kapyong in what would be known as the Battle of Kapyong. Madden was among three Australian soldiers captured during the battle. During captivity, he demonstrated strong defiance to his captors. His defiant conduct, observed by many of the other prisoners and which would eventually see him nominated for the George Cross, was maintained despite beatings and other punishments such as extreme rationing of his food. His ill treatment eventually resulted in his death from malnutrition sometime in late November or December 1951 at age 27. Madden was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his conduct as a prisoner of war, which set an example for his fellow captives. === George Cross Citation === The George Cross was presented to his sister on 9 May 1956 by the Governor of New South Wales, Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott. Madden's body was recovered following the armistice that saw an end to the war and was subsequently buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery at Busan, South Korea. 3 RAR's Other Rank's (OR's) canteen, located within their barracks, is officially named the \\"Madden Club\\" after Bill Madden. == Notes == == References == * * == External links == * Category:1924 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Australian Army soldiers Category:Australian recipients of the George Cross Category:Australian military personnel of the Korean War Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Australian prisoners of war Category:Korean War prisoners of war Category:Australian military personnel killed in the Korean War Category:People from Sydney ","title":"Bill Madden (soldier)"},{"id":"9152630","text":"The Archdiocese of Monrovia (Archidioecesis Monroviensis) is the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Monrovia, Liberia.

Inside, the arch box has diaphragm braces (0.3 meters thick, 4.1 metres spacing) with corresponding vertical beams on the outer wall.

The upper deck rests on concrete girders (one for each track), 3.5 metres high, width varied from 0.5 to 0.7 metres. This bold bridge has become an icon of pre-World War II soviet propaganda, including a postage stamp (January 1941) and movie appearances.

In fact, Juan is good friends with Julian who's an old bell ringer and a gardener that isn't sure about the swallows' migration to a peaceful island in the summer. Julian explains to Juan how this beautiful mission was founded by Saint Francis and his brothers, especially Father Junipero Serra. He also explains to the Spanish lad how unsure he is about the swallow family's migration. Juan and Julian really love the swallows AKA las golondrinas very much and doesn't want them to leave Mission San Juan Capistrano. He and his friend feed tiny pieces of bread that Julian saves in his pockets. Plenty of birds appear in the garden including hummingbirds, sparrows, white doves and especially swallows. In the spring, he plants a garden on his vacation time. There's nothing more exciting to see the family of swallows nesting in the protagonist's very own garden. One of the children tells the other the amazing journey the swallows make all the way from South America to spend the summer in California during St. Joseph's Day to watch a family of swallows migrate far away from San Juan Capistrano to a peaceful island. On Saint Joseph's Day, Juan's dream comes true which gets to the point where Juan and Julian alert everyone in the village by ringing the bells of Mission San Juan Capistrano together. The swallow family gets to nest in the arches of the mission after all before summer begins. One day, a baby swallow falls out of the nest and Juan witnesses the shock of the situation with his feathered friends. His/her parents don't reject the chick at all after Juan saved him/her. Everyone gets ready for Saint Joseph's Day by dressing up and celebrating before summer arrives in the village. Juan sings \\"Las Golondrinas\\" before he plants his own garden for the swallows to nest at during his vacation time. On Saint Joseph's Day, the children sing \\"The Swallow Song\\" together while they join Juan in the garden. Juan returns to his adobe house and observes the migration of the swallows who nested in his garden on a rose bush that appears near Mission San Juan Capistrano. They'll always come back to Mission San Juan Capistrano in the spring even though he gets to hear Julian sing the swallow song that the children also sang on Saint Joseph's Day.

He was the son of Sir Rhys ap Thomas, the de facto ruler of most of south-west Wales who aided Henry Tudor in his victory on Bosworth Field in 1485 and Efa ferch Henry.Ralph A. Griffiths, Sir Rhys ap Thomas and his family (University of Wales Press, 1993), p. 39 et. seq.. ==Early life== In the reign of Richard III his father's loyalty was questioned to the house of York as support grew for Henry of Richmond (later Henry VII of England). Around the time of Richard's usurpation and Buckingham's rebellion in 1483, as a way of keeping Rhys ap Thomas's loyalty, Richard demanded an oath of allegiance from Gruffydd's father as well as demanding that his young son Gruffydd be in his own custody. Rhys assured Richard of his loyalty but refused to hand over young Gruffydd, who was only four or five at the time.Chrimes, S B Henry VII, pg. 43 When Gruffydd was older he became a member of Prince Arthur's household. Henry VII of England aimed to have his son friends with influential young men with powerful fathers in Henry's kingdom, and Gruffydd's father was one of the most powerful men in Wales after the death of Jasper Tudor in 1495, and he was chosen to serve the young Prince. Gruffydd and Prince Arthur seem to have been quite close; in 1501 Gruffydd was made a Knight of the Garter, and was with Arthur and his bride Catherine of Aragon when they returned to Ludlow in December 1501; and was there for Arthur's death in April 1502. ==Death of the Prince== On the death of Prince Arthur in 1502, Gruffydd ap Rhys was a prominent mourner. He accompanied the Prince's body from Ludlow to its final resting place in Worcester. The following contemporary record gives an account of Gruffydd as he travelled with the \\"rich chariot\\" which carried Prince Arthur's body: \\"in mourning habit, rode next before the leading horse on a courser trapped with black, bearing the Prince's banner.\\" During the funeral service for the Prince in Worcester Cathedral, he once again carried Arthur's \\"rich embroidered banner.\\" ==Later life== Sir Gruffydd ap Rhys's tomb. Gruffydd was present with Arthur's younger brother Henry VIII of England when Henry travelled to France for the famous Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Gruffydd married Catherine St John, daughter of John St John who was related to Margaret Beaufort around 1507 and had one son: Rhys ap Griffith (1508‚Äì1531), who was later executed by Henry VIII for treason as he was considered a threat to Henry VIII and was executed for treason on charges widely believed to be false in 1531 (purportedly for inscribing the name \\"Fitz Uryan\\" on his armor). Gruffydd's tomb is also in Worcester Cathedral. Catherine married Peter Edgecumbe. After his death, in July 1543 her friend the diplomat Ralph Sadler recommended her to Henry VIII to be sent to Scotland to join the household of Mary, Queen of Scots. This plan was interrupted by the war of Rough Wooing.Arthur Clifford, Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230. ==References== * * Steven Gunn and Linda Monckton, ed, Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales, Boydell 2009 Category:1521 deaths Category:History of Wales Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Welsh knights Category:16th-century Welsh people ","title":"Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas"},{"id":"9152697","text":"A forest division is a term used to signify an area containing one or more (usually) demarcated and (usually) protected or resource-managed forests, for administrative purposes.

URL accessed 12 January 2013. \\"The Woman who Lost her Dumplings\\" was the title of the original tale from Lafcadio Hearn's collection Japanese Fairy Tales, which Mosel had adapted. ==Plot== The story is set in Japan. The title character (which is a little old woman) likes to laugh (\\"Tee- he-he-he\\") and makes dumplings out of rice. One day, one of her dumplings rolls down a hole. The funny little woman chases the lost dumpling and ends up in a strange place underground lined with Jizo (guardian statues). The Jizo warn the old woman not to go after the dumpling because of wicked oni (monsters) who live there, but she does anyway. An oni grabs the old woman and takes her in a boat across a river to the house of the oni. She becomes surrounded by several more oni in the oni house. The oni team forces the old woman to cook rice dumplings for them. They give her a magic paddle to make a full pot of rice dumplings for dinner from a single grain. The magic paddle can make up to ten thousand rice dumplings at a time. When the woman (with the magic paddle) goes up to two thousand rice dumplings, the pot becomes full. Now, in the end, the oni team ends up having rice dumplings. Every day, there was always rice dumplings for dinner on them thanks to the fact that the old woman was always there to cook for them. It is revealed that oni eat more rice dumplings than most people. So every day, the woman lived with the monsters and there was always food (rice dumplings) for them every day (at every sequence of the day; day, afternoon, and night). But after a couple of millenniums later, the woman becomes homesick. One afternoon, she decided that it was time for her to return home. So she gave up being with the oni and decided to go back. When the oni are not looking, the woman takes the magic paddle, and escapes on a boat. Suddenly, the monsters returned and found that the woman was missing. They find her rowing her boat back home on the river. Then they try to follow the woman. It is also revealed that oni do not swim. Because oni cannot swim nor fly, the oni team thought of a plan to stop the old woman. They (secretly) drink all the river water in an attempt to stop her (that way they can keep her from leaving, live with them forever, and she can always continue to make rice dumplings for them). So, to stop the woman, they drink water from the river. When the water dries up, the water bed turns into nothing but a river of mud. The woman realized she was too worried to laugh. The boat gets stuck in the mud. Then the woman tried to run away. However, she found herself with her hands stuck, her feet stuck, and she fell into the mud (unable to run away). Her struggling to run in the river mud makes the oni laugh. The oni team mimics the woman's \\"laugh\\" (teasing/making fun of her). But when they do, their laugh accidentally results the water to be released from their mouths and causes it to flow back into the river, and allows the woman to finish crossing to the other side in the boat. The funny little woman returns home. She sees her family, sells rice dumplings to people (including her family) made with the magic paddle, and becomes \\"the richest woman in all of Japan.\\" ==References== Category:1972 children's books Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:Children's fiction books Category:American picture books Category:E.

The novel was first published in 1994. ==Plot summary== The Ramsay Scallop has two main characters, Thomas of Thornham and Elenor of Ramsay. They were betrothed to each other when they were young. When Thomas returns broken and disillusioned from the Crusades, he finds the idea of marriage and lordship overwhelming. Elenor dreads the idea of marriage to Thomas, both because she does not like him and because she is afraid of bearing children. She is afraid to bear children because her mother died giving birth to her. Father Gregory sends both of them on a religious pilgrimage to Santiago, Spain, to put the record of Ramsay's sins on the shrine of Saint James. Both of them are relieved because the pilgrimage means the delay of their marriage and a last chance for adventure. On their special pilgrimage, they meet different people, and discover the glorious possibilities of the world around them and within each other. At the end of the book both of them get married and they understand each other very well. Both of them realize that people can change and that nobody will be the same.

URL accessed 27 May 2009 As of 1993, the book has been published by Simon & Schuster. ==Description== The book‚Äôs 31 pages contains full-color, double-paged pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations, reproduced in combined line and halftone lithograph. The font of the text is set in 12 pt. Century Schoolbook. Each page measures 8\\"x10\\". == Plot == The story focuses on a young Native American girl who has a deep affinity for wild horses. She cares for the horses that her tribe relies on for the nomadic hunting of buffalo. One day, the herd stampedes due to a thunderstorm, while the girl is among them. She climbs onto the back of one of the horses, and is carried far away from their usual grazing grounds. The next day, the girl awakes to see a beautiful spotted stallion who identifies himself as the leader of all the wild horses, and welcomes her to live with them. Meanwhile, the girl‚Äôs tribe searches for her. About one year later, two hunters spot the girl riding with the horses, but she is driven away with the rest of the herd. The hunters return to the tribe with this news, and riders are sent in pursuit. The stallion defends the girl, but she is caught when her horse stumbles. The girl returns home, but is sad to leave the horses. She falls ill with no sign of improvement. The girl asks if she can return, and her parents honor her wish to live among the wild horses again. Each year, she would return to her parents with the gift of a colt. Then one year, she does not return. When the hunters see the wild horses again, they see a mare riding alongside the stallion. They believe this horse to be the girl transformed, which brings the tribe great pride to know they have one of their own riding among them. ==Writing and Illustration== The book features illustrations with colorful ethnographic imagery of the Plains Indians of North America typical of Goble‚Äôs work. The artwork features \\"Goble's trademark style-thin white space outlining the stylized figures in glorious traditional Plains Indian garb\\". Many of the illustrations depict groups of plants and animals found in the grassland regions of North America, such as prairie dogs, bison, badgers, birds, insects, and lizards. The storytelling and corresponding art combine to show the close relationship with nature typical of traditional Native American myths, folklore, and visual arts. ==Critical reception== The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses has been viewed favorably by critics, particularly for its artwork and positive portrayal of Native American culture. School Library Journal expressed that \\"the real strength of the book lies in the highly detailed, full-page lithographs finely printed in bright colors\\" and \\"the illustrations alone make this worth owning\\". The New York Times has referred to Goble as a \\"fine artist\\", having an \\"energetic, hard-edged dexterity\\" to his style, who \\"creates panoramas of the wild horses and their environment that are both dramatic and beautifully detailed\\". In The New York Times review of the book by Georgess McHargue, she declares that \\"anyone who admires Indian culture will appreciate this fully authentic portrayal of Plains camps, customs and costumes\\". The Horn Book Magazine has said \\"both storytelling and art express the harmony with and love of nature which characterizes Native American culture\\". According to Kirkus Reviews, \\"Goble tells the story soberly, allowing it to settle, to find its own level\\", with illustrations \\"in the familiar striking Goble style, but softened out here and there with masses of flowers and foliage\\". ==Awards== The book received the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1979.

For each of the twenty fables Lobel's text occupies one page, with his colour illustration on the facing page. He gives a moral to each, but while the moral is genuine, the tone of the fables is cheerful and playful rather than moralistic. For instance, in the first fable a bed-loving crocodile admires the orderly pattern of flowers on his bedroom wallpaper. When confronted with the riot of flowers in Mrs. Crocodile's garden he retreats to his bed in distress, where he is comforted by the neat floral rows of the wallpaper. After that he seldom leaves his bed, becoming a sickly shade of green.

His work includes portraiture and self-portraiture which consist of transsexual bodies in both clothed and nude form. ==Biography== Loren Rex Cameron was born in Pasadena, California on August 28, 1959. He moved to rural Arkansas in 1969 after his mother's death, where he lived as a self-described tomboy on his father's farm. By the age of 16, Cameron identified as a lesbian and encountered homophobic hostility in the small town where he lived. At this time, Cameron quit school and left his home to travel the country seeking work as a construction laborer and other blue collar employment. In 1979, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he identified socially with the lesbian community until the age of 26, when he confronted his dissatisfaction his body and was excluded from the lesbian community. Cameron's interest in photography coincided with the beginning of his physical changes as he documented his own physiological transition from female to male at this time. Despite his lack of formal training, beginning in 1993 Cameron studied the rudiments of photography and began to photograph the transsexual community. Since 1994, he has given lectures on his work at universities, educational conferences and art institutes. By 1995, Cameron's photographs had been shown in solo exhibitions in San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles. ==Career== Cameron's photography and writing was first published by Cleis Press in 1996. His first published works (Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits and Man Tool: The Nuts and Bolts of Female-to-Male Surgery) consist largely of self-portraits, and portraits of other female to male transsexuals. Body Alchemy documented Cameron's personal experience of transition from female to male, his life as a man, and the everyday lives of trans men he knew. The nude figures' poses in the artist's photography often portray moments of action and performance. In many of his self portraits, he includes the shutter-release bulb that he used to take the photograph. The choice to work alone and feature the bulb serves as a commentary on the self- made aspect of being transsexual. His photography shows how the issues of queer bioethics come up not only in clinical sites but also in public art and museum spaces. His work was intended to remove the clinical view of transsexual bodies and redefine them as not in need of a cure. Body Alchemy became a double 1996 Lambda Literary Award winner. It remains his most well- known work to date, though he has since published other photographic works. More recently published work includes representation of both female and male transsexuals, portraits and classical nudes (Body Photographs by Loren Cameron Volume 1 and 2. Cameron's work was first shown as part of a 1994 exhibit in San Francisco. His images have also been exhibited in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, in Santiago, Chile, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in Mexico City, Mexico. They have been published in numerous books such as Transgender Warriors (Leslie Feinberg, 1996) and Constructing Masculinity: Discussions in Contemporary Culture (Routledge, 1995). He has also posed for photographers such as Daniel Nicoletta, Amy Arbus, and Howard Shatz. The LGBTQ+ community has been the most supportive of the artist's photography. Highlighting the work in their community centers and print media. Cameron lectures throughout the United States at universities and other venues, including Smith College, Harvard, Cornell, Brown, the University of California at Berkeley, Penn State, and at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In May 2008, Cameron presented his work at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. On television, he has been profiled on the Discovery Health Channel's LGBT-themed one-hour special Sex Change: Him to Her, on the National Geographic Channel's \\"Taboo\\" Sexual Identity\\" series. He has also been interviewed in the magazine, The New Yorker. == Impact == Cameron's work is controversial among critics. Many praise his photographs as compelling and informative, while others criticize it for being sexually explicit. In 2012, The University of Minnesota-Duluth invited Loren Cameron to campus to present his photography. The University paid Cameron $4,000 from student services to cover his speaker‚Äôs fee and travel expenses. This decision was met with backlash, due to him and his subjects' identity as transsexual individuals, as well as the nudity in Cameron‚Äôs work. Despite the objections, Cameron delivered his presentation on September 26, 2012. Body Alchemy is considered by some to be influential for bringing attention to the social and medical issues that transsexual people face. ==Works Books === *Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits. 1996, Cleis Press. . *Cuerpos fotografiados por Cameron: fotograf√≠as.

The station goes by the name ESPN Radio 1320. WISW was formerly known as \\"News Talk 1320 WIS\\" or \\"WIS Radio\\",NewsTalk 1320 WIS ... Columbia's News / Talk leader taking the base of its call sign from the former WIS. The latter station was the longtime sister station of WIS (TV), Columbia's long-dominant NBC affiliate. The WIS portion of the call letters stood for \\"Wonderful Iodine State.\\" The former WIS is now WVOC. The station is owned by Cumulus Media, which also owns AC WTCB, classic hits WOMG, The Game WNKT and Urban AC WLXC in the Columbia radio market. All five stations share studios located at the Granby Building in Cayce and the WISW transmitter is in West Columbia. ==History== 1320 signed on as WKIX in 1945. The station featured local and national programing from the CBS Radio Network. In 1947, the station became WMSC, retaining the CBS Radio affiliation. The transmitter site was later used by WZLD and WXRY. In 1953, WMSC was sold to new owners and the station became WOIC. WOIC had begun on 1470 and was the first station to target the African American community in Columbia. In 1976, WOIC applied for an FM on 103.1, which was dismissed and awarded to another group. WOIC appealed, which caused the application to be held up. The case was dismissed in October 1981 and 103.1 became WPDN (now WOMG) in 1982. WPDN was acquired by WOIC's parent company, Nuance Corporation, by 1985. By the 1980s, WOIC's ratings started to decline due to the growth of new Urban Contemporary outlet WWDM. In the fall of 1989, it was announced by then-owners Price Broadcasting that the station would change over to a simulcast of WOMG-FM's Oldies format. In order to prevent any community backlash, an arrangement was worked out with 1230 WODE to move the staff and programing over to their station. WODE became WOIC, while WOIC became WOMG, simulcasting the majority of WOMG-FM's programming, breaking off at times for broadcasting various Clemson University sporting events. In 1995, WOMG became all-news WISW under a local marketing agreement with Cosmos Broadcasting, then-owners of NBC affiliate WIS; the \\"WIS\\" call letters had previously resided on AM 560 (now WVOC) from 1930 to 1986. The station featured AP News as well as simulcasts of WIS's newscasts. In 1997, the syndicated Imus In The Morning show was added. Despite the changes as well as exposure from WIS-TV, ratings did not materialize as hoped. In August 1999, Imus was dropped for \\"Good Morning Columbia\\", hosted by longtime former WSCQ air personalities Bill Benton, Doug Enlow, and Gene McKay (who died in 2007). Both McKay and Benton began in the Columbia market on the original WIS until leaving in the mid-1970s for WSCQ, which they were part-owners. Benton's son Charlie, a WISW sales manager, joined the show in 2007 after McKay's death. With the addition of \\"Good Morning Columbia\\", WISW shifted the format to a mostly satellite-fed Adult Standards format, but kept the WIS newscasts in the process. By 2002, the station adjusted its format again to a full-time news- talk format, competing head-on with rival WVOC. In addition to \\"Good Morning Columbia\\", the station featured a rotating \\"Local Angle\\" hour with nationally syndicated Neal Boortz, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Rollye James, and Jim Bohannon. Until the format and transmitter move of WNKT from Charleston to Columbia, a weeknight \\"Prime Time Sports\\" program and a weekly \\"Sporting News Radio\\" program were featured, but they moved to WNKT, which was now a Columbia-area station serving sports. That opened up Mark Levin's new ABC Radio show to WISW. Former WISW ident used until February 2014. Also in 2002, WISW became the official flagship station of the South Carolina Gamecocks after Host Communications decided to take the contract to Citadel Communications. WVOC had been the flagship of the Gamecocks for 48 years, but owner Clear Channel Communications was not willing to move any Gamecocks- related programming to the more powerful FM stations in its Columbia cluster. In contrast, Host's contract with Citadel guaranteed the Gamecocks airtime on Citadel's FM stations. The station lost flagship status when WNKT moved in from Charleston in 2007. However, WISW remains the exclusive home of the women's basketball program (when there is a conflict between men's and women's games, WNKT airs the men's game while WISW airs the women's game). \\"Good Morning Columbia\\" moved to WWNU and later WWNQ in 2012. On February 3, 2014, WISW shifted to a Sports Talk format, utilizing the NBC Sports Radio Network. After a brief period as \\"1320 The Fan,\\" it switched its branding to \\"NBC Sports Radio AM 1320\\". When NBC Sports Radio ended programming as a full-time sports format WISW switched to ESPN Radio, branded as \\"ESPN Radio 1320\\". ==See also== *List of radio stations in South Carolina ==Previous logo== 200px (WISW's logo under previous NBC Sports radio affiliation) ==References== ==External links== *WIS Radio's Official Website ISW Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:Cumulus Media radio stations Category:Radio stations established in 1945 Category:1945 establishments in South Carolina ","title":"WISW"},{"id":"9153162","text":"Obolon () is a station on Kyiv Metro's Obolonsko‚ÄìTeremkivska Line.

He was born in Henderson, Texas. In 1973, Cowart sustained debilitating injuries from a propane gas explosion that resulted in the loss of his hands and eyes. He suffered significant hearing loss, and was so severely burned over most of his body that the only place where his skin remained undamaged was on the bottom of his feet. Prior to the accident, he was known to his family and friends as Don or Donnie; however, after the accident he changed his first name to Dax because it was a rather uncommon name, easier for him to write, and it helped to avoid the embarrassment he felt after responding to someone he thought was addressing him, only to discover they were addressing someone else with the same name. Cowart's pleas that he be allowed to die were not honored even though, that same year, the American Medical Association had endorsed a competent patient's right to discontinue prolonged life-saving treatments. He said the doctors thought that if they forced him to receive treatment, he would change his mind and want to live, and that it would be the best outcome for him in the long run. Dax disagreed and continued to hold the belief that it is wrong to force a person who is in full control of their faculties to receive treatment against their will; a violation of one's civil rights. Despite the debilitating effects of his injuries, Cowart graduated from Texas Tech University in 1986 with a law degree, and established his own legal practice as a personal injury attorney. He became notable for the ethical issues he raised over the medical community's efforts to save his life against his wishes. His case is often cited in discussions of medical ethics. == Accident == On July 25, 1973 Cowart was a 25-year-old US Air Force Reserve pilot working with his father, a cattle rancher and real estate broker in Henderson, TX. The accident occurred as they returned to their car after inspecting a tract of land they were considering for purchase. A nearby underground pipeline was leaking propane gaswhich unlike natural gas is heavier than air and thus collects in low areas such as the creek bed near which they had parkedand as they started the car the propane exploded. The surrounding trees and vegetation caught fire as Cowart was showered with glass from the windshield. He made his way out of the car and ran, breaking through three walls of fire, rolling on the ground after each one to extinguish his burning clothes. After a mile and a half he collapsed. He later wrote: Cowart's father, who had been outside the car at the time of the explosion, was found barely alive near the edge of the fire. Both men were taken to a hospital in Kilgore, and from there another , in the same ambulance, to Parkland Hospital in Dallas; Cowart's father died en route. Fearing he would be unable to regain his former level of activity, he refused treatment en route to the hospital. In the hospital, he has written, he was \\"forcibly treated for 14 months\\" despite asking to be allowed to die. He likened some of the treatmentssuch as bandage replacement and chlorinated bathsto feeling he was being \\"skinned alive\\". He was given limited painkillers because of a poor understanding of their risks, and was denied access to legal assistance by which he might have forced treatment to end. Cowart's injuries required amputation of both his hands, leaving only a fragment of thumb by which he could grasp small items such as eating utensils and a cup handle. Both eyes were removed and damage to his ears left his hearing impaired. What little undamaged skin remained on his body was used for grafts to reshape his nostrils, lips, and eyelids. He attempted suicide several times. ==Later life and death== Cowart earned a law degree in 1986 from Texas Tech University. He opened his own law practice, and later worked with trial attorney Robert Hilliard, founder of Hilliard Munoz Gonzales LLC., Corpus Christi, Texas. After the accident, Cowart changed his first name to Dax to avoid confusion after he embarrassingly discovered that, on more than one occasion, he had mistakingly responded to the name Donald when another person was being addressed. The shorter name was also easier for him to write. He married Samantha Berryessa, a California attorney, and they lived on a farm in San Diego County. Cowart was a frequent teacher and speaker at the Trial Lawyers College in Dubois, Wyoming. The college was founded by Gerry Spence, and the courses provided are Continuing Legal Education (CLE) accredited by \\"the state in which the course is held.\\" Cowart spoke on patient rights in the US and abroad. His life and his reflections on what has happened to him challenged medicine's understanding of itself as a moral practice. A documentary of his plight titled Please Let Me Die was filmed in 1974, with a follow-up documentary titled Dax's Case filmed in 1984. Cowart's case illustrates several issues of patient autonomy.James F. Childress, Practical reasoning in bioethics, Indiana University Press, p122.

It was published by Philomel (Penguin Young Readers Group) in 1989. Young won the 1990 Caldecott Medal for the book's illustrations. ==Description== The story is a Chinese version of the popular children's fable \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" as retold by Young. Contrary to the original fable, in which there is only one child (Little Red Riding Hood) who interacts with the nemesis of the story (the wolf), Lon Po Po has three children. It is written from their point of view. The majority of the illustrations are divided into three pictures per every two pages to form a bigger picture (with a few exceptions). Young uses dark colors for the illustrations to set the tone of the story. ==Synopsis== The story is set in China. Three sisters, Shang, Tao, and Paotze are left alone overnight while their mother goes to visit their grandparents's house for the grandmother Po Po's birthday. She (before leaving for their grandmother and grandfather's house) warns them as she leaves to \\"Be good\\" and \\"Remember to close the door tight at sunset and latch it well\\". She then tells the girls she is returning home not tonight but after one or two nights. An old wolf lived nearby. The wolf, who sees the mother leave, then decides to come over to harm the children. The wolf pretends to be their grandmother, Po Po, to try to gain entry. The children question the wolf through the door, \\"Why are you here so late?\\" and \\"Why is your voice so low?\\", to which the wolf has clever answers. The two youngest children finally open the door and let the wolf in. Because of the darkness, the children can't see that it is a wolf. When it is time for bed, the children and the wolf are to sleep together. The children notice \\"Po Po's\\" wolflike characteristics. They question him like \\"Po Po, your foot has a bush on it\\", \\"Po Po, your hands have thorns\\" to which the wolf has more clever answers. Finally, Shang (the oldest) lights a candle and before it gets blown out, sees that Po Po is really a wolf. She devises a plan to get herself and her sisters out of the house. She tells the wolf about the delicious, magical gingko nuts that grow on the tree outside their home. The children go out and climb the tree where she tells the other two who Po Po really is, while the wolf follows. They tell the wolf to get a rope and a basket so they can pull him up the tree to get the nuts, all the while planning on dropping the wolf once in the basket to kill him. On the third time dropping the wolf to the ground they succeed in killing him (where he not only bumps his head but also breaks his heart into pieces). The girls (Shang, Tao, and Paotze) then ask the wolf if he is okay, but they hear no answer. There was no answer because the wolf had died from the fall (he fell to his death and broke into pieces). With the wolf defeated, the girls then go in the house and go to sleep (after seeing the wolf's dead and broken body). After the mother's return the next day they tell her what happened. ==Audiobook== Young's version was made into a critically acclaimed audiobook that was released in 2006. It was made into a 12-minute-long audiobook and colored video and DVD. It is narrated by actor B. D. Wong. ==Critical response== Lon Po Po has been critically acclaimed.

Boniface, in a letter to a Mercian priest, states that Abel was born and raised in England, as were the other four bishops who previously addressed King √Üthelbald by letter (see below). Folcuin, however, believed that Abel was Irish. Historian Wilhelm Levison has argued therefore that the monk must have been a different Folcuin, but Eugen Ewig accepts the identification. If Folcuin's late testimony has any basis in reality, it may be that Abel, like his near contemporary Ecgberht (d. 729), had once visited Ireland. Abel is one of the most well known saints in the world. He was commemorated as patron saint of the blind and lame. ==Bishop of Reims== Boniface (d. 754) presided over the Council of Soissons in March 744. The conciliar acts record that Abel was elected archbishop of an unspecified see, as was a certain Hartbert. Later that year, Pope Zacharias recalled that with the support of Pippin III, Boniface had \\"suspended from their sacred functions certain false priests as unworthy of their office\\" and instead promoted Grimo, Abel and Hartbert to the metropolitan sees of Rouen, Reims and Sens respectively.Letter by Pope Zacharias to Boniface, dated Nov. 5, 744, ed. Tangl (no. 58), tr. Emerton. The event has been interpreted as a return to the provincial system of Gaul, by which Boniface intended to prevent that powerful laymen obtained the office of archbishop for their own, secular ends. Milo (d. 762/3), for instance, who probably was a layman rather than a consecrated bishop, had held the sees of Trier and Reims since c. 722. In June, Pope Zacharias confirmed Abel as archbishop by sending him the pallium. He did the same for Hartbert, bishop of Sens, and Grimo, bishop of Rouen. In August, however, Boniface wrote again to request a pallium for Grimo alone, to which Zacharias replied asking why Hartbert and Grimo had not been included in his request. What followed is uncertain. The next time one hears of Abel, he is named as one of Boniface's 'fellow bishops' who around 746 sent a letter of exhortation to √Üthelbald, king of Mercia. It seems that Milo controlled the three sees, while Abel, Hartbert and Grimo remained in office only as suffragan bishops. In 751, Boniface once more addressed a letter to Pope Zacharias, in which he lamented the injustices of lay control over the church, but his erstwhile ambitions were never realised. It is unknown when Abel gave up his position or died. The 9th-century Life of Saint Remigius, written by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, claims that Milo had driven Abel from the see in favour of Tilpin, Abel's successor. The date given is 748, but it now appears that Tilpin succeeded in 762 or 763, when Milo died. ==Commemoration== In the early modern period, Abel's name was inserted in a number of martyrologies, under a variety of dates. Examples are the 17th-century martyrology of Gabriel Bucelin, the Martyrologium Gallicanum (1637) of Andr√© du Saussay, and John Mabillon. The Bollandists include a Life of Abel under 5 August, compiled by John Pinius.O'Hanlon, Lives of the Irish saints, 5 August. ==Notes== ==References== * ==Primary sources== *Acts of the Council of Soissons (744), ed. *Letters of Boniface, ed. ; tr. *Folcuin, Gesta abbatum Lobiensium, ed. *Hincmar, Vita Remigii episcopi Remensis, ed.

Published by Houghton Mifflin, it received mixed reviews upon its release but was the recipient of the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1991. The book tells four overlapping stories, each drawn with a distinct visual style. The four stories are \\"Seeing things\\", about a boy on a train trip by himself, \\"Problem parents\\", about siblings whose parents behave differently one night, \\"A Waiting Game\\", about people waiting for a train, and \\"Udder Chaos\\", about cows who escape and then return to their field. Macaulay had the idea of creating a book about journeys in the 1980s and combined several previously unrelated sketches in order to form the four stories in the book. Owing to its metafictional structure, the book is considered a main example of a postmodern picture book. The book is designed to be interpreted in a number of different ways and can be frustrating for readers who wish to have a simple narrative they can absorb without thinking too much about. The text and pictures of the book both complement each other and provide a sense of tension as they are sometimes in opposition to each other. Black and White is credited with helping to advance the form of a picture book and is seen as a direct or indirect inspiration for several other picture books. == Background and publication == David Macaulay started drawing the sketches which would become Black and White in the 1980s. The idea of journeys interested Macaulay, especially the idea that turning the page could be its own journey. Eventually, Macaulay decided to combine four different stories from his sketchbook into a single book. Macaulay wanted each story to look different‚Äî\\"I did everything I could to visually separate each fragment\\"‚Äîincluding choosing a different medium and set of characters for each. The book was published in March 1990 by Houghton Mifflin. == Plot == Each two-page spread of the book features one of four stories. In the upper left quadrant there is a story titled, \\"Seeing things\\". In this story a boy is on an overnight train trip to be reunited with his parents. At one point in the journey, the train's progress is stopped and he is briefly joined by what the text refers to as an \\"old woman\\" but which the illustrations suggest might be the robber from \\"Udder Chaos\\". Looking out the window, the boy is unable to tell what has stopped the train and laughs when the driver attempts to chase away what appear to be boulders. However, to the boy's amazement, the boulders begin to move off the tracks. Later the boy falls asleep only to be awoken by the train stopping and the sound of singing. Thinking he sees snow outside, the boy opens the windows but when he sticks out his hands to catch some, the boy realizes that it's actually torn up newspaper. The boy then notices \\"strange creatures\\" standing near the train who are responsible for the torn paper and singing. When the train resumes its journey, the boy falls back asleep only to be awoken at the train station where the boy is returns to his parents. A newspaper hat similar to that worn by several different characters in Black and White. In the lower left quadrant the story is titled, \\"Problem Parents\\". A brother and sister, with the sister serving as the narrator, know the routines of their parents who predictable in their actions, such as leaving for work each day at 7 a.m. and returning home at 7 p.m. However, one night the children, and their dog, recognize that the parents are not their normal selves because they come home wearing newspaper costumes and singing She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain. The children's parents then find newspapers at home and, ignoring attempts at normal conversation topics, dress the children in newspaper also. The brother joins in the fun more quickly than his sister, who unsuccessfully attempts to jolt her parents back to normal. The narrator is horrified when her brother suggests they go out to dinner dressed as they are and manages to convince the other family members to leave the costumes at home. In the end, the narrator admits the experience is fun, though she finds her parent's antics \\"exhausting\\" when they ask her about her homework as she's heading to bed. The upper right quadrant's story is titled, \\"A Waiting Game\\", with the only text representing announcements from a loudspeaker. A number of passengers, all of whom are reading a newspaper, wait for their train at a station, which has been delayed. Eventually the passengers finish reading their newspapers and become bored waiting for the train. One passenger, to applause, makes a triangle hat out of her newspaper causing other passengers to join in. Soon they start making newspaper shirts, bunting, and confetti. When the train arrives they throw the torn newspaper into the air. After the train leaves with the passengers, the only characters left are a robber, and the station master who is cleaning up the mess from the newspapers. The fourth story, in the lower right, is titled \\"Udder Chaos\\". While the text describes what happens if Holstein cows escape their field, the pictures illustrate the movements of a robber, dressed in black and white stripes and a black mask. At first he hides among the cows, and then among a choir who the cows pass by, and then once again among the cows who stop the progress of a train. In the end the robber has disappeared and the cows return home so that they can be milked. == Writing and illustrations == The book is considered one of the leading examples by some scholars and educators of a postmodern picture book. Part of this is because of its metafictional aspect,van Renen, C. (2011). Having their say: engaging with contemporary picture books at work and at play. Journal of Literary Studies, 27(2), 1+. Retrieved from ebscohost. something Macaulay himself spoke of in his Caldecott acceptance speech, \\"the subject of this book is the book. It is designed to be viewed in its entirety, having its surface 'read all over.'\\" It is a book of and about connections‚Äîbetween pictures and between words and pictures. Each of the four stories is presented with a unique design and illustration style. \\"Seeing things\\" was illustrated with watercolor, \\"Problem Parents\\" was illustrated in pen and ink and had dialogue through captions, \\"A Waiting Game\\" had colored ink, and \\"Udder Chaos\\" had colored ink with the lines removed. The printing technology enabling this kind of book with its multiple illustration styles and typesets was relatively new at the time of Black and White's publication. The various ways the stories overlap are never fully explained and are instead left for the reader to discern. The reader is primed to interact with the writing and illustrations by the unattributed warning on the title page to \\"carefully\\" inspect the different stories. Even the writing style, utilizing the passive voice, encourages the reader to take \\"agency\\" over the story. The number of stories, and their intersections, are determined primarily through analysis by the reader of the illustrations. Further, the stories can be read in any particular order or combination and indeed sometimes can only be understood by reading the book in a non-linear manner. In the words of Macaulay, \\"it isn't necessary to think in straight lines to make sense.\\" The text is written to be subtly funny through its use of irony. The illustrations also add core elements to the story; while there is an illustration of a mask on nearly every page the word does not appear in the text.Dresang, E. T., McClelland, K., & McCelland, K. (1995). Black and White: A journey. Horn Book Magazine, 71(6), 704‚Äì711. Retrieved from ebscohost. This complexity suggested it could be enjoyed by both traditional picture book readers, that is, children under the age of five, but also older children and teens. Macaulay plays with this interaction between text and pictures. At times they can be complementary as in the start of \\"Problem Parents\\" but at other times can be discordant as in Seeing Things when the text suggests it's an old woman on the train, while the illustrations suggest it's the robber. At times the text can be misleading, as in \\"Udder Chaos\\" where the text is about Holsteins while the illustrations focus on a robber and with some believing that the robber is merely a figment of imagination of the boy from \\"Seeing Things\\". The illustrations also intersect with one another and can even become part of the text, as when the drawing of a cow's udder becomes the U in the title for \\"Udder Chaos\\". There are also visual similarities between the stories and characters. The boy of \\"Seeing things\\" and the robber present in that story and \\"Udder Chaos\\" both wear striped shirts, while the mask of the robber and the dog's face are quite similar. The dog, whose name tag shows \\"Chris\\", has been interpreted by some as an homage to Chris Van Allsburg whose books have a reoccurring motif of a terrier. Themes in the story include the parent-child relationship and the interconnectivity of life. Trains are a motif through all four of the stories.Burns, M. M. (1990). Black and White. Horn Book Magazine, 66(5), 593‚Äì594. Retrieved from ebscohost. There can be thematic coherence found in the two stories on stories on the left page where two sets of children are attempting to make sense of unusual events and also wishing to be reunited with their parents. The book also promotes the idea that nothing is as simple as it seems, such as with the words \\"Black and White\\" appearing in blue, white, and green font on the cover and in red font on the title page. This red font has been interpreted as a reference to the joke \\"What is black and white and read all over? Newspapers\\" given newspapers' importance to the story. Black and White has both order and chaos, expressed through the story, illustrations, and design of the book. The chaos of the story increases, reaching its climax when the only colors used are black on white on a page, before order is restored at the end of the stories and at the end of the book. However, the final page, featuring a hand picking up the train station from \\"A Waiting Game\\" and the nose of the dog from \\"Problem Parents,\\" can have multiple interpretations. == Reception and awards == Macaulay in 2012alt= The book was given mixed reviews at the time of its publication. Kimberly Olson Fakih praised, \\"Macaulay's avalanche of creativity\\" in the Los Angeles Times. Professor and Children's book author Liz Rosenberg also noted the book's unusual format, \\"In its oddity and fixed unfixity it is a genuine original, and may perhaps become a children's puzzle classic.\\" In a mixed review, Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"endlessly inventive\\" but suggested that the complexity might be too much for readers to understand, though the reviewer later admitted her confusion was partially caused by being under deadline to produce the review.LONG, J. R. (2009). Black and White. Horn Book Magazine, 85(1), 71‚Äì72. Retrieved from ebscohost. Similarly, Karen Litton writing in School Library Journal suggested the book was confusing and \\"more show than go\\" in a mostly negative review.Litton, K. (1990). Black and White (Book). School Library Journal, 36(6), 104. Retrieved from ebscohost. This confusion was seen in a more positive way by The Horn Book Magazine's Mary Burns, \\"perhaps there is no one explanation but rather a series of playful allusions and clever delusions which are meant to be enjoyed by the freewheeling and freespirited as an escape from the ordinary.\\" The book proved popular immediately with children, being recognized as a \\"Children's Choice\\" by the International Reading Association in 1991.Children‚Äôs choices for 1991.

In his acceptance speech, he spoke of how he felt \\"obliged to say something tonight that matters, at least to me, and something which will, I hope, make a difference to you.\\" He delivered his speech in four parts, each named after one of the stories from the book. Previous Caldecott winner David Wiesner praised the book in 2012, \\"Structurally unlike any medal winner before it ‚Äî or since ‚Äî Black and White...redefined the way stories could be told in picture books. And, just as importantly, it did this while being very, very funny.\\" == Legacy == Black and White has been credited with helping to change the perceptions of what a picture book could be. This book was quickly seen as an important way of connecting with kids during a digital age. Black and White has been labeled a transition text from traditional to digital picture books.Gralley, J. (2006). Liftoff: When Books Leave the Page. Horn Book Magazine, 82(1), 35‚Äì39. Retrieved from ebscohost. Despite being enjoyed many children, when examining the book for use, teachers can feel that the complexity of the book is too much for children, while children who enjoy the book do so because of its complexity. Teachers who do choose to use the book can do so in a way that demonstrates that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and as an example of the value gained through group collaboration and discussion of literature. Black and White was seen as inspiring future books such as The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. == References == Category:1990 children's books Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:American picture books Category:Houghton Mifflin books ","title":"Black and White (picture book)"},{"id":"9153268","text":"Tuesday, written and illustrated by David Wiesner, is a 1991 wordless picture book published by Clarion Books.

Wiesner subsequently won the Caldecott Medal in 2002 for The Three Pigs, and the 2007 medal for Flotsam. ==Description== Tuesday is an almost wordless picture book for children, written and illustrated by American author David Wiesner. The book was originally published in 1991 by Clarion Books, and then re-published in 2001 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books for Young Readers. The book contains 35 pages and is designed for children ages 3 and up. Tuesday is dedicated to Tom Sgouros. ==Plot== The story contains only six words and three points that determine the time of the action. The whole story is narrated by colorful pictures of frogs flying on their lily pads. The story begins on \\"Tuesday evening, around eight\\". A group of frogs start their journey in some wetlands, then fly to the nearest town. They levitate past birds that sit on the electric wires, pausing at the kitchen window of a man eating his sandwich. The frogs pass through someone's backyard. They enter the house where an old lady sleeps in front of her television. The squadron of frogs appropriate her remote control and stare avidly at the screen. At \\"4:38 a.m.\\", they encounter a dog who tries to catch one of the frogs, but joins their adventure. At dawn, the frogs return to the pond and their normal life of resting on lily pads and swimming. Back in the city, people investigate traces left by the frogs. The final pages of the book show \\"next Tuesday\\" around eight in the evening, with pigs hovering above the roof of a farm building. ==Critical reception== The School Library Monthly declares that Tuesday has ‚Äúspellbinding effect on first-time readers that they may wish to join in the adventure‚Äù. The New York Times highlights that Tuesday ‚Äúallows readers to concoct their own story lines‚Äù. while Publisher Weekly calls the book ‚Äústunning: slightly surrealistic, imbued with mood and mystery‚Äù. Mary Lou White, from the Caldecott Award Selection Committee chair summarizes Wiesner's work as a ‚Äúmasterful use of light and dark, alternating perspectives, and variation in page design‚Äù. Kirkus Reviews claimed that Wiesner \\"provides plenty of intriguing visual details to ponder\\". ==Awards== *Caldecott Medal (1992) *Japan Picture Book Award (1992) ==Animation project== In 2002 Tuesday was used for the production of an animated movie which belongs to the anthology film Paul McCartney: Music & Animation. The director of the enterprise was Geoff Dunbar, with the production tasks carried out by Paul McCartney.

Published in 1998, the book is about Wilson Bentley, the first known photographer of snowflakes. Azarian won the 1999 Caldecott Medal for her illustrations.American Library Association: Caldecott Medal Winners, 1938 - Present. URL accessed 27 May 2009. == Description == Snowflake Bentley is a medium-size book, measuring 10 ¬Ω by 10 ¬º inches, and having 16 pages of illustrations. The majority of the pictures are large colorful prints, the typical art style of artist Mary Azarian, and each picture summarizes the wording for that page. Many of the pages have a vertical side bar in each layout, with a light blue background, and white snowflakes that contains factual information about Wilson Bentley. Azarian also uses a black bold frame around her illustrations, intended to represent a photo that has been taken. == Synopsis == The book is based on a true story. Martin has written about the first known snowflake photographer, Wilson Bentley, and his interest in capturing snowflakes. Wilson lived on a farm with his family in Jericho, Vermont, between Lake Champlain and Mount Mansfield, where the annual snowfall can reach up to about 120 inches. Wilson was very fond of snowflakes and wanted to capture them one day to share with others. With a microscope, Wilson tried to depict the snowflakes through drawings but was never able to finish, as the snow would melt too quickly. As Wilson grew older, he asked his parents if they could get him a camera, so that he could photograph snowflakes. Wilson‚Äôs parents decided to spend their savings to buy Wilson his camera because they wanted to support his dream of capturing snowflake photos. With his new-found camera, Wilson went out to take hundreds of pictures. In the beginning, Wilson‚Äôs photos were a bunch of failures, but that did not stop him from pursuing his dream. Wilson furthered himself by experimenting more with lighting, lenses and camera exposures. Not many people were interested in what Wilson was up to, nor did they care for his pictures. When it wasn't winter, Wilson loved taking pictures of nature, but taking snow pictures would always be his favorite. Wilson would even hold evening slideshows on his lawn to show his friends. Later down the road, Wilson wrote a book about snow and published his photos in magazines. When Wilson went to publish his first book to share to the world, he got caught in a blizzard on his trip, a misfortune which caused him to catch pneumonia and become ill. Two weeks later, Wilson died of the illness. In memory of him, Wilson‚Äôs friends and neighbors built a museum of his work so all would know of ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äù Bentley. == Critical reception == Snowflake Bentley received many reviews. Kirkus reviews says ‚ÄúThis is a lyrical biographical tribute to a farmer‚Ä¶whose love of snow and careful camera work expanded both natural science and photography‚Äù,Kirkus Reviews and Horn book review says ‚ÄúThe book exhibits a beautiful blend of Azarian‚Äôs splendid woodcuts, a lyrical text, and factual sidebars.‚ÄùHorn Book Reviews ==References== Category:American picture books Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:1998 children's books Category:Houghton Mifflin books Category:Children's history books Category:Works about photographers ","title":"Snowflake Bentley (book)"},{"id":"9153368","text":"The Three Pigs is a children's picture book written and illustrated by David Wiesner.

It is an entirely two-track and electrified mainline railway that is operated Deutsche Bahn. It is designed for speeds of up to 160 km/h. In section from Bremen Hauptbahnhof to Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof is 62.0 km long, but its extension via Bremerhaven-Lehe to the Bremerhaven-Speckenb√ºttel marshalling yard and on to Columbuskaje (Columbus Quay) is also often included. The most important intermediate station is Osterholz-Scharmbeck, where Regional-Express trains also stop. Bremerhaven Hbf Loxstedt Stubben Bremen Hbf The line was fully opened on 23 January 1862 jointly by the Royal Hanoverian State Railways and Bremen. Today it mostly sees freight traffic and local passenger trains. The last long-distance trains were InterRegio trains on the line Cuxhaven-Luxembourg that were discontinued in 2001. ==Current operations== The line has no long distance services. Until 2001, it had several long distance trains, including InterRegio, Intercity and Intercity-Express trains. An Intercity-Express running between Bremerhaven and Munich and InterRegio trains between Cuxhaven and Luxembourg and Saarbr√ºcken are recent examples. Regional-Express services run on the Bremerhaven‚ÄìBremen‚ÄìOsnabr√ºck line at 2-hour intervals (in peak hours trains operate hourly). Since December 2010, line RS 2 of the Bremen S-Bahn runs hourly between Bremerhaven-Lehe and Twistringen. In addition the line is used by a large amount of freight traffic, particularly for the transport of containers and cars to and from the Bremerhaven ports. The line used to be also called the Geeste Railway (, after the Geeste river, where it ended). This name was however also used for the Bremerhaven‚ÄìBuxtehude railway (west of Bremerv√∂rde), which is closer to the river. ==History== The route was a hard- fought compromise between Hanover and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, then independent countries. Around 1850, people from Vegesack and Blumenthal argued for a direct connection to the Weser estuary. This was expected to promote the development of the villages of the marshes on the eastern shore of the lower Weser (the Osterstade). Hanover, however, preferred a route via Lesum, Scharmbeck and Beverstedt. It would be possible to build a branch from Beverstedt towards Hamburg, making Hanoverian Geestem√ºnde a winter port for Hamburg. Bremen proposed as a compromise a route roughly along today's federal highway B 6, which was built between 1817 and 1839. Finally, both countries agreed to split the difference, so that the line runs near Stubben and Loxstedt. The end of the line was originally in Geestem√ºnde, now a district of Bremerhaven, but then not part of Bremen. The port of Bremerhaven (and since 1896 the first part of the Bremerhaven‚ÄìCuxhaven line) was connected from a junction just before the end of the line. In 1914 this became the route to today's Bremerhaven Hauptbahnhof, originally called Geestem√ºnde-Bremerhaven station. ==Notes== ==References== * * == External links == * Category:Railway lines in Lower Saxony Category:Railway lines in Bremen Category:1862 establishments in Germany ","title":"Bremen‚ÄìBremerhaven railway"},{"id":"9153906","text":"Forest Range Officer / Ranger / Forest Circle Officer () is an officer for a State Forest Service (SFS) in the Government of India.

Madame Figaro was spearheaded by Robert Hersant, who succeeded Jean Prouvost (creator of the French women's fashion magazine Marie Claire). The magazine experienced immediate success, owing to its diverse contents, and the quality of the writing, targeting affluent readers. The first female Editor-in-Chief of the magazine was Marie-Claire Pauwels, daughter of Louis Pauwels. The launch of Madame Figaro in 1980 marked a distinct distancing from the feminist movement of the preceding decade (notably from the movement to \\"liberate pornography\\" that had a goal of seizing power from the dominant moral and religious institutions). Madame Figaro had its origins as a single page feature appearing in Figaro Magazine, because that magazine's majority of readers were female, drawn to its orientation towards topics on culture and the art of living (l‚Äôart de vivre).Claire Blandin, Le Figaro: Deux si√®cles d‚Äôhistoire, Armand Colin, 2007, p.264 Le Figaro publishes a number of other supplements, each on a particular day of the week, for example, an economic news supplement, a supplement for its Paris-region readers, and so on. Madame Figaro is devoted solely to topics interesting to female readers. This has included such highly debated topics of the 1980s as: sexual relationships between men and women; aspirations towards equality between the sexes and to further women's emancipation; how to make families succeed during marriage; children and strong families. Madame Figaro is a mainstream women's magazine, feminine and a vehicle for ideas that are both liberal and conservative, since the beginning of the 1980s. A vital part of \\"Madame Figaro's\\" content is its focus on enhancing women's careers, and challenging conventional views of women's roles in society.Marianne Lohse, ¬´ 40 femmes qui font la France ¬ª, Madame Figaro, n¬∞ 11420, May 1981, p.18 Madame Figaro was among the first news publications in France to publish feature-length articles on the condition of women in foreign countries, using its own journalists. The worlds of fashion, beauty and interior design are the fundamental content of the magazine. Articles discussing elegance and distinction, all while taking a critical view of fashion's social conformity, have been hallmarks of the presentation of fashion in Madame Figaro.Marie-Claire Pauwels, ¬´ Madame Figaro ou le snobisme de masse ¬ª, Les √âchos de la Presse et de la Publicit√©, n¬∞ 1476, 15 December 1986, p. 44 Culture in its broad sense occupies a place of importance in Madame Figaro, from literature, to history, as well as music. The magazine has had many articles on French celebrities such as Jean Giono,Catherine Caubere, ¬´ D√©couvrez la Provence de Giono ¬ª, Madame Figaro, n¬∞11242, October 1980, p.20 Jean Anouilh,Constance Pontiatowski et Marion Thebaud, ¬´ Les spectacles du mois ¬ª, Madame Figaro, n¬∞11528, September 1981, p.10 as well as the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan.Jacques Doucelin et Jean-Luc Wachthausen, ¬´ Les disques du mois ¬ª, Madame Figaro, n¬∞11528, September 1981, p.22 The magazine had been published by Hachette Filipacchi until 2001 when it began to be published Quebecor World Inc. The first international edition was published in Portugal under the name M√°xima. During the 1980s, Madame Figaro expanded into several countries, such as Japan and Turkey, following the trend of globalization in women's magazines. In the 1990s, the Chinese version began to be published. In 2019, Madame Figaro further developed to a total of ten editions, latest of which started in Hong Kong in fall 2019. Madame Figaro appears with the Saturday edition of Le Figaro. ==Madame Figaro today== The magazine published an online edition in addition to its paper edition. A part of the content of Madame Figaro is accessible free of charge online. The online edition also has several blogs dedicated to fashion and beauty topics, such as Fashion, etc‚Ä¶ by Claudine Hesse.Fashion, etc. Madame Figaro. During the last half of 2007, the circulation of Madame Figaro was 455,802 copies. In 2011, the magazine had a circulation of 449,800 copies. The director of publishing in 2012 is Anne- Florence Schmitt. The magazine has two editors-in-chief, Nicole Picart (Fashion) and Blanche Rival (magazine). ==Editorial direction== The publication is dedicated to trends in beauty and fashion. The editorial approach and the design target readers with high incomes, with luxury good advertising, and publishing articles for readers with a familiarity with current affairs. Among its regular features are : Culture Madame, Rendez-vous Madame (public events and places), mode / accessoires et beaut√© (fashion, accessories, and beauty), le Carnet de St√©phane Bern (St√©phane Bern's journal), and the pages Conversation, Week-end, and others. === Notable former contributors === * Princess Grace of Monaco * Genevi√®ve Gennart * √âlisabeth Gassier * Marie-Dominique Sassin * Constance Poniatowski * Christine Clerc === Grand Prix Litt√©raire (great literary prize)=== The Grand Prix Litt√©raire de l'H√©ro√Øne Madame Figaro is a prize awarded every year since 2006 by the magazine.

Quirk, who wore uniform number 5, was notable for his hustle between plays on the football field, resulting in the length of games being shortened. He is known for being involved in a game that later became known as \\"The Instant Replay Game\\". ==Personal== Quirk attended high school at Long Branch High School in Long Branch, New Jersey, where he played football, and later graduated from in 1963. Following high school, he served two years at Fort Monroe in Virginia as a First Lieutenant in the Continental Army Command Headquarters Honor Guard Company. He was a guard and linebacker at the University of Delaware and later earned a master's degree in personnel administration from George Washington University. Quirk began a career in government securities on New York City's Wall Street in 1965. For thirty-two years, he traveled all over the world, trading with foreign banks. While working in New York City, his interest began in football officiating. A resident of Rumson, New Jersey, Quirk is married to Carol Christopher, his high school sweetheart; they have three children. ==Officiating careerEarly years=== Quirk began his football officiating career working high school games, and as an off-field official at Giants Stadium. During New York Giants football games, he served on the chain crew and later was the stadium's game clock operator. Progressing to the college level in 1977, he officiated in the Eastern College Athletic Conference as an umpire until 1988. ===NFL career=== Quirk was hired by the NFL in 1988 as a line judge and he later moved to the umpire position. Since coming into the league, he was assigned to Super Bowl XXXII, and he was an alternate in Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Instant Replay Game Quirk has worked memorable games throughout his career. In his second year in the NFL, he was involved in an instant replay decision during a 1989 NFL season game between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers. It would become known in NFL lore as \\"The Instant Replay Game\\". On fourth down, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski threw an apparent fourteen- yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe with thirty-two seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to tie the score of the game at 13-13. As a line judge, Quirk ruled that Majkowski's body had crossed the line of scrimmage, which under rules was an illegal forward pass, nullifying the touchdown and turning over the ball to Chicago. The play was reviewed by the replay official, Bill Parkinson. Parkinson relied on the view supplied by a fixed camera on the roof of the stadium to review the play. After a four minutes and 54 seconds, he ruled the ball was still behind the line, overruling Quirk's call, and giving the Packers the score. Green Bay kicked the extra point and won the game, 14-13. The impact of this play resulted in the change of the illegal forward pass rule for the 1990 NFL season to include a passer's body being across the line, not only the ball, in determining an infraction and a limit of two minutes for instant replay reviews. The following year, the Bears, still upset over the replay reversal, noted the game with an asterisk in the team's media guide as a \\"Replay ruling\\". It has been said this call was one of the factors that led to the resignation of Art McNally, who at the time was the league's supervisor of officials. Altercations with players As an umpire, Quirk often is responsible for breaking up scuffles among players. During a 1999 NFL season game between the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams, Quirk attempted to break up a skirmish between the Rams Jeff Robinson and the Bears Ty Hallock. Quirk grabbed Robinson by the waist and tackled him to the ground. Robinson was ejected by Quirk for throwing a punch at Hallock. As the game was concluding, Robinson asked Quirk if he could have a photo taken together. Robinson later had the photo enlarged and hung it on the wall of his den. After the game, Todd Lyght commented on Quirk's tackle saying, \\"He did that with authority, and that was an older guy, too. That wasn't one of the young umps. He put it on him. I think that might open up (ESPN's) Prime Time.\\" Dick Vermeil, then-coach of the Rams, later joked with Robinson, asking him, \\"(Quirk is a) Hell of a tackler, isn't he?\\" In another memorable game between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers, this time during the 2007 NFL season, Quirk grabbed Packers linebacker Nick Barnett around the neck and pulled him to the ground during a scuffle between the two teams. Following the game, Quirk was told by league officials privately that he went \\"over the line\\" in restraining Barnett, but he would not face disciplinary action. Mike Pereira, the league's director of officiating, said, \\"[Quirk] should refrain from similar techniques when trying to break up a potential skirmish.\\" At the time of the incident, Barnett's agent withheld from filing a formal grievance with the league in exchange for a public apology by the league that Quirk's actions were wrong. Joking about the incident, Barnett said, \\"I got in a choke hold, I couldn't really breathe a little bit. [Quirk] got a good one on me. I don't know how he got under that face mask, but he got a good hold on me.\\" On December 28, 2007, the NFL announced that Quirk was fined an entire game check, US$8,150, for his actions against Barnett and for an earlier altercation on December 16, 2007 with Atlanta Falcons fullback Jason Snelling on a kickoff return. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1940 births Category:American football linebackers Category:College football officials Category:Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football players Category:Long Branch High School alumni Category:National Football League officials Category:George Washington University School of Business alumni Category:People from Rumson, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Long Branch, New Jersey Category:Players of American football from New Jersey ","title":"Jim Quirk"},{"id":"9154054","text":"A stationary engineer (sometimes called an operating engineer or power engineer) is a technically trained person who operates, troubleshoots, and oversees industrial machinery and equipment that provides energy in various forms. Stationary engineers are also known as Process Operators in some settings. Stationary engineers are responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of a wide range of equipment including boilers, steam turbines, gas turbines, pumps, gas compressors, generators, motors, air conditioning systems, heat exchangers, refrigeration equipment, heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) that may be directly (duct burners) or indirectly fired (gas turbine exhaust heat collectors), hot water generators, and refrigeration machinery in addition to its associated auxiliary equipment (air compressors, natural gas compressors, electrical switchgear, pumps, etc.). Stationary engineers are trained in many areas, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, metallurgical, computer, and a wide range of safety skills. They typically work in factories, office buildings, hospitals, warehouses, power generation plants, industrial facilities, and residential and commercial buildings. The use of the title \\"Stationary Engineer\\" predates other engineering designations and is not to be confused with the title ‚ÄúPEng‚Äù typically given to professional engineers in their given field. The job of today's engineer has been greatly changed by computers and automation as well as the replacement of steam engines on ships and trains. Workers have adapted to the challenges of the changing job market. The stationary engineering profession emerged during the Industrial Revolution. The group includes railroad engineers and marine engineers. Famous people who began their working lives in this trade include George Stephenson and Henry Ford. The early steam engines developed by Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen which drew water from mines and the industrial steam engines perfected by James Watt and others employed the ancestors of today's engineers. Railroad engineers operated early steam locomotives and continue to operate trains today. The traditions and classification of the engineer were developed to the greatest extent by marine engineers who worked in the engine rooms of the great ocean liners in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many power engineers are becoming more involved with the technical aspect of the job as it has shifted toward a dependence on building automation. Building and central plant operations are now relying heavily on direct digital controls; and as such the engineer is required to be much more computer literate to work with the BAS (Building Automation System). In Canada, power engineers are ranked by classes, with Fifth class being the starting point and First class being the highest level attained. However, in India there are only two classes ‚Äì 1st class and 2nd class. This is a national standard in Canada and India. In the United States, stationary engineers must be licensed in several cities and states. The New York City Department of Buildings requires a Stationary Engineer's License to practice in the City of New York; to obtain the license one must pass a written and practical exam and have at least five years' experience working directly under a licensed stationary engineer, or one year if in possession of a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. Holders of the Stationary Engineer's License primarily work in large power generation facilities, such as cogeneration power plants, peaking units, and large central heating and refrigeration plants (CHRPs). For the State of California, Stationary Engineers are the State of California Military Department's sole source of Airfield Lighting and Repair. ==External links== * The International Union of Operating Engineers * The National Association of Power Engineers, history of \\"Stationary Engineers\\" *The American Society of Power Engineers *The National Institute for the Uniform Licensing of Power Engineers Category:Plant operator Category:Power engineering ","title":"Stationary engineer"},{"id":"9154059","text":"PME Aggregation Function (PAF) is a computer networking mechanism defined in Clause 61 of the IEEE 802.3 standard, which allows one or more Physical Medium Entities (PMEs) to be combined together to form a single logical Ethernet link. The PAF is located in the Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS), between the Media Access Control (MAC)-PHY Rate Matching function and the Transmission Convergence (TC) sublayer. It interfaces with the PMEs across the Œª-interface, and to the MAC-PHY Rate Matching function using an abstract interface. PAF is an optional function which was defined before 2007 for two IEEE 802.3 interfaces: 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS, both of which were Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM) copper physical layers. ==Details== PME Aggregation function has the following characteristics: * Supports aggregation of up to 32 PMEs * Supports individual PMEs having different data rates (max 1:4 ratio) * Ensures low packet latency and preserves frame order * Scalable and resilient to PME failure * Independent of type of EFM copper PHY * Allows vendor discretionary algorithms for fragmentation PAF Transmit function works by fragmenting incoming Ethernet frames into a number of fragments, limited in size to a range between 64 and 512 Bytes. A sequential fragmentation header is prepended to each fragment, indicating if the fragment is from the start-of-packet, end- of-packet or middle of packet. A frame check sequence (FCS) is appended to each fragment, which is then transmitted by the next available active PME in the aggregated group. The following diagram illustrates the PAF fragmentation: EFM PAF diagram PAF Receive function reassembles the original frames from the received fragments, which are buffered in a per-MAC fragment buffer. The algorithm uses the fragmentation header to make sure that the reassembled frames are in order. ==History== The PME Aggregation function was first defined in IEEE 802.3ah in 2004. The original Loop Aggregation proposal was submitted by Klaus Fosmark from now defunct First Mile Systems in 2001. It was later referenced by ITU-T G.998.2 (Ethernet-based multi-pair bonding) and its ANSI equivalent NIPP-NAI T1.427.02. ==Comparison== PAF algorithm and fragmentation header are very similar to MLPPP which works at layer 3 (IP). PAF is an asymmetric protocol, i.e. all information required for reassembly is contained in the fragmentation header sent with each fragment. While allowing great flexibility in Transmitter and Receiver implementations it requires an overhead consuming about 5% of the bandwidth (estimation for 2BASE-TL protocol, including 64B/65B encapsulation). PAF is optimized for the Ethernet traffic. Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) is another aggregation protocol, which unlike PAF uses fixed size cells, sending them across multiple links in a Round-Robin fashion. IMA is optimized for ATM and in the extreme cases (short Ethernet frames) may add as much as 40% overhead due to the AAL5 encapsulation. ITU-T G.998.3 (Multi-pair bonding using time-division inverse multiplexing) specification, a.k.a. G.Bond/TDIM, defines a symmetric aggregation protocol, in which both sides of a point-to-point link exchange information about the aggregation, so there's no need for a separate header. G.Bond/TDIM is optimized for both Time-Division Multiplexing and packet traffic with less than 3% overhead (estimation for Ethernet traffic, including Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) encapsulation). ==See also== * Ethernet in the First Mile * 2BASE-TL * 10PASS-TS ==External links== *Get IEEE 802.3 - \\"IEEE Standard for Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications\\", IEEE Std 802.3-2008, November 2008. *IEEE 802.3ah - Ethernet in the First Mile Task Force archive Category:Bonding protocols Category:Ethernet Category:Network protocols Category:Physical layer protocols ","title":"PME Aggregation Function"},{"id":"9154081","text":"Philip Nott Ober (March 23, 1902 ‚Äì September 13, 1982) was an American screen and stage actor.

Mercia was then ruled by Edward's sister √Üthelfl√¶d and her husband √Üthelred. ==Career== √Üthelstan seems to have been appointed Ealdorman of East Anglia and other parts by King √Üthelstan in about 932. The lands King √Üthelstan gave him had mostly been part of the Danelaw which had only been forced out of the area after the Battle of Tempsford in Bedfordshire fifteen years earlier in 917. √Üthelstan's brother √Ülfstan became Ealdorman of some parts of Mercia at about the same time and both of them may have participated in King √Üthelstan's invasion of Scotland in 934. His other brothers, Eadric and √Üthelwald, were witnessing charters as Ealdormen by 940. √Üthelstan and his family were supporters of the monastic reforms of Saint Dunstan which introduced the Benedictine rule to Glastonbury. Both Glastonbury, and Abingdon Abbey, were endowed by √Üthelstan.Higham, p. 4; Williams. √Üthelstan's wife was named √Ülfwynn. Her family came from the East Midlands. She was foster-mother of King Edgar of England. √Ülfwynn's lands would later endow Ramsey Abbey, refounded by Bishop √Üthelwold of Winchester, Bishop Oswald of Worcester, and √Üthelstan's son √Üthelwine. Byrhtferth of Ramsey, author of a Life of Saint Oswald in the early 11th century, devoted considerable space to √Üthelstan's family, several of whom were buried at Ramsey. The epithet Half-King comes from Byrhtferth's writings. Several members of the family were buried, or reburied, at Ramsey. The position of √Üthelstan and his brothers in the middle of the 10th century has been compared with the similar dominance of the family of Godwin, Earl of Wessex in the 11th century.Higham, p. 4; Miller; Williams. It is possible that √Üthelstan's withdrawal to Glastonbury may not have been voluntary.Higham, p. 4. However, the death of √Üthelwald in 962 resulted in the family's offices in Wessex passing to their chief rivals, the family of Ealdorman √Ülfhere. The result of this was that the two families were roughly equal in influence. √Ülfhere's death in the early 970s did not result in a return of the old dominance of √Üthelstan's family.Higham, pp. 5 & 68-69. ==Family== People associated with √Üthelstan's family include Ealdorman Byrhtnoth, whose defeat at the Battle of Maldon is commemorated in verse.Higham, p. 22. √Üthelstan's children included: * √Üthelwald (died c. 962), Ealdorman of Essex, then of East Anglia after his father became a monk. Queen √Ülfthryth, daughter of Ealdorman Ordgar, who was later the third wife of King Edgar, was first married to √Üthelwald. * √Ülfwald, called dux in charters.Byrhtferth of Ramsey (The Life of Saint Oswald, iii, 14) writes of √Ülfwald: \\"He was exalted with such great authority, that he even disdained to become an ealdorman; , retrieved 2007-01-28. √Ülfwald was a prominent supporter of the monasteries and ordered the death of one Leofsige who was attempting to claim lands belonging to the monastery of Peterborough.

The station joined the network in November 1982, following the opening of the line between Tynemouth and St. James. The station is located a short walk away from the National Rail station at Manors, which is situated on the East Coast Main Line. An abstract mural, Magic City by British artist Basil Beattie, was commissioned in 1987, and can be seen on the station concourse. The station is located towards the edge of the city centre, and is relatively lightly used. Manors was used by 170,337 passengers in 2017‚Äì18, making it the eighth-least-used station on the network. Heading east from Manors, the route surfaces alongside the East Coast Main Line, before crossing the dramatic Byker Viaduct over the Ouseburn Valley, towards Byker. The S-shaped viaduct was constructed for the Tyne and Wear Metro by Ove Arup, with work commencing in 1976, and completed in 1979. The former North Eastern Railway route between Manors and Jesmond is connected by a link tunnel, located to the west of the station. It is used only by trains running out of public service, allowing them to terminate at Manors, and then return to the depot at South Gosforth (and vice versa), without having to travel around the North Tyneside Loop. == Facilities == Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with two lifts providing step-free access to platforms at Manors. As part of the Metro: All Change programme, new lifts were installed at Manors in 2014, with new escalators installed in 2015. The station is equipped with ticket machines, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is fitted with automatic ticket barriers, which were installed at 13 stations across the network during the early 2010s, as well as smartcard validators, which feature at all stations. There is no dedicated parking at the station, however there are nearby pay and display car parks, operated by Newcastle City Council. There is the provision for cycle parking, with 5 cycle pods available for use. == Service and frequency == Manors is served by the , which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes. Services from platform 1 operate towards South Shields via Whitley Bay, with the first train departing at 05:51 (06:03 on Saturday and 06:10 on Sunday). Services from platform 2 operate towards St. James, with the first train departing at 05:49 (06:07 on Saturday and 06:52 on Sunday). Trains run frequently across the network, at intervals of up to every 12 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime), and every 15 minutes (evening and Sunday), with the last trains departing at around midnight.

The jumping position is a position used by equestrians when jumping over an obstacle. It usually involves what is known as the \\"forward seat\\" or \\"2 point\\" because the rider's legs provide two points over which the rider's weight is balanced on the horse. It was first developed by Captain Federico Caprilli. This involves the rider centered over his or her feet, with the stirrup leathers perpendicular to the ground. Continuing a line upwards from the stirrup leathers, the head and shoulders fall in front of the line, as do the knees, the hips fall behind it. A correct jumping seat serves two purposes: * It gives the horse the freedom to jump the obstacle, allowing it to keep the forelegs and hindlegs tight, thereby decreasing the chance of a rail down or a fall. It also encourages the horse to bascule over the fence, which improves jumping form and ability to jump higher obstacles. * It provides the rider the support needed to stay out of the horse's way while still maintaining a secure seat so that the horse is less likely to fall on landing. ==The influence of the horse on position== The jumping seat is not meant to be held by the rider, but rather it is a fluid seat that changes as the horse's balance changes. It keeps the rider in a position over the horse's center of gravity. It is important to note that the horse, not the rider, is responsible for opening and closing the rider's angles (notably, the hip and knee). As the horse takes off, it raises its upper body off the ground and comes closer to the rider. This makes the rider's hip angle (between the thigh and chest) close. Over the fence, the rider keeps the angles closed. As the horse lands, it moves away from the rider's body, which allows the hip angle to open and the rider to become more perpendicular to the ground. Also, if the horse takes a jump wrong in some manner, due to rider error or other, the rider may be thrown around a little bit and may sometimes get 'left behind', where the rider's center of balance is behind that of the horse's. This can also throw the horse off balance and lead to other problems such as knocking down a rail. ==Position of the leg== Poor leg position often makes it difficult for the rider to stay with the horse's efforts The lower leg is the anchor of the rider's position, and contributes a great deal to his security. Poor lower leg position makes a rider more likely to lose balance over fences, and therefore increases the chance that he may fall. It also tends to decrease the ability of the rider to communicate clearly with his or her horse. The leg should hang down the horse's side, making even contact along its whole length (inner thigh, knee, and calf), and should not change position when the upper body moves. The rider's weight is dropped along the back of the leg and into the heel through a flexible ankle, so that the heel is lower than the toes. The toes are generally turned out slightly, to a degree greater than in the flatwork-only English riding disciplines such as dressage or saddle seat. This places the back of the calf against the horse, instead of the whole inner calf as in dressage, which decreases the refinement in communication between horse and rider, but anchors the rider and increases security. Toes should turn no more than 45 degrees out. The stirrups are shortened from the length used for flatwork, adjusted according to the height of the fence. Grand Prix jumpers and eventers on cross-country generally need to shorten the stirrups the most, to allow them to gallop and jump in motion with their horse. The short stirrup provides more leverage and flexibility, and therefore security, better balance and a more secure position should the horse stumble, get a poor distance, or peck on landing. More importantly, a shorter stirrup allows the rider to get off the horse's back between and over the fence, freeing up the back and allowing the horse to bascule. The stirrup leather should remain perpendicular to the ground. The stirrup iron is usually placed on the ball of the foot, allowing the rider to have a flexible, shock-absorbing ankle. The rider should keep even pressure across the foot, rather than pushing on the inside or outside of the stirrup iron, as this makes the lower leg stiff. The result of a shorter stirrup is that the ankle and knee angle decrease. Both the angles are used as shock-absorbers, opening and closing accordingly with the thrust of takeoff and landing. Stiffness in these angles makes it harder to stay with horse's balance, which may result in the riders \\"jumping ahead\\" or being \\"left behind.\\" ===Variations in leg position=== Steeplechase jockeys shove their legs forward for extra security. Leg position may vary slightly between disciplines. Combining a relatively short stirrup with a need for security, Eventers and steeplechase jockies tend to have a slightly forward leg position, with the foot \\"home\\" in the iron. The more forward leg position increases security, making it more difficult for the rider to become dislodged. This is important in both sports because riders jump solid fences at high speed, where the horse is more likely to stumble or fall if it hits the fence. Especially in the case of steeplechase jockey, a fall could be extremely dangerous, as the other horses in the race could trample him or her. The foot can be placed \\"home\\" (with the stirrup behind the ball of the foot, near the heel) for security purposes. This decreases the chance that the rider will lose a stirrup should a horse jump or land awkwardly. However, this is very dangerous in the manner that should the rider fall, the foot may become caught in the iron and a rider could be dragged by the horse, ending in serious injury or death. ==Position of the seat, hips, and thighs== The rider keeps his or her weight toward the pelvis, and generally has enough weight in the stirrups to be suspended in the air over the saddle, rather than sitting on the horse's back. The rider should not bring the hips too far forward, over the pommel, as seen in the fault of jumping ahead. This changes the rider's balance, and creates a potentially dangerous position. The hip joints are especially important, as they are the connection between the lower leg (which remains still), and the upper body. The hips should be very flexible, opening and closing as needed. The hips should always move backward from the neutral position, not forward (a sign that the rider is jumping ahead). Between fences, the rider may ride in two-point position, where the thighs take up weight of rider, not the seatbones. Another position used in galloping, when additional control is needed, is the \\"half seat,\\" which resembles two-point position, but the rider's seat bones lightly touch the saddle. At slower speeds, or if considerable control is needed, the rider may sit down on the horse, where the seat bones touch the saddle. (Depending on regional terminology, both the half seat and a full seat are sometimes referred to as \\"three point\\" position) ==Position of the Upper body (shoulders, head, trunk)== Looking down causes the upper body to fall forward. In all disciplines, the rider should be looking up and in the direction of where he or she needs to go on landing. Looking down tends to cause riders to lean forward with the shoulders and round their back, thus placing them in a precarious position. The head should also not be tilted to one side, as this changes the rider's lateral balance and places more weight on one side. In general, the back should be flat. Overarching causes stiffness, rounding not only looks bad, but affects the rider's balance. A slightly rounded back is acceptable cross-country when used in the safety seat. The rider should have an open chest with shoulders back. This helps to prevent the rider from collapsing forward and helps to center the weight of the upper body over the lower leg, therefore helping to keep the rider secure. ==Releases== Short crest release. A long crest release being used for a large oxer to allow the horse more freedom. The automatic release: the rider has a straight line from elbow to bit, and maintains a soft, elastic contact with the horse's mouth. Slipping the reins while going down a drop. In all cases, the rider should release the horse over a fence, or in other words, lengthen enough rein so the horse can stretch its neck forward and use it as a balancing mechanism. The key to a good release is relaxed arms with proper hand, wrist, and elbow position. First, the arms (elbows and shoulders) should be soft and elastic, allowing the horse to pull them forward as needed. Preferably, there should be a straight line from bit to elbow (automatic release), as this improves contact and communication between horse and rider. The wrists of the rider should remain soft and straight, as bent wrists tend to stiffen the lower arm. The elbows should be next to the rider's side, not \\"chicken-winged\\" and pointing outward, which decreases flexibility and softness. As in all riding, the hands should be softly closed, neither tightly holding the reins which causes tension and stiffness, or so soft that the reins easily slip through. The one exception to this rule is when the rider needs to slip the reins. ===Types of releases=== There are three classic releases. Different releases are used depending on circumstances. However, all riders should strive to readily be able to use each one as needed, and should practice them all. Basic release: the rider grabs the mane of the horse. This allows the rider to avoid falling back and hitting the horse in the mouth or back, or try to use the mouth for balance. It is used by beginning riders who do not yet have the position and balance to do more advanced releases without risking hitting their horse in the mouth. It is also used by more advanced riders on green horses, who tend to overjump, or when a rider for some reason loses position due to an awkward jump. Riders should not think it is reserved for novices, and all good riders will grab mane to save their horse's mouth. However, it provides the least amount of control. It should therefore not be used if it is not required. It can also be used for galloping, where the riders weight should be in the heels, therefore giving the horse freedom. Short crest release: the rider slides the hands up the crest as the horse takes off, not before (which \\"drops\\" the horse). The hands should not slide far up the crest, only a couple inches, as needed. It provides support for the rider's upper body, while still providing a good amount of control because the rider did not release any more than needed. Best used on verticals, when the rider needs to turn mid-air, or when going down drop fences. An intermediate release. Long crest release: Similar to the short crest release, in that the rider slides his hands up the crest, but the hands are pushed much further along the neck. Gives a great deal of freedom, but fairly little control. Best for very wide oxers, to allow the horse to really stretch across, or for green horses that may jump large or awkwardly, for gymnastics grids, and for use on horses that have been hit in the mouth over fences and are reluctant to jump or stretch down over a fence. The rider should be careful not to associate a large movement forward with the hands and elbows to mean a movement forward with the hips. The hip angle should still close backward. Many riders get into the habit of jumping ahead with this release. Critics say this release is overused and exaggerated by hunter riders; in the hunter ring it is often used by experienced and/or professional riders on well-trained horses over jumps of relatively modest size. Proponents say that this shows off a talented hunter by proving the horse needs little assistance from the rider to jump in good form. Automatic release: The most advanced release, where the rider maintains a soft, elastic, steady rein contact with a straight line from elbow to bit as the horse jumps. This release results in a great deal of control and communication between horse and rider, allowing the rider to signal to the horse what to do on landing. It allows the rider to better turn while in the air, to correct horses that jump crookedly, and to provide the support that some horses prefer over fences. It is also good on horses that need much control after landing. However, the automatic release requires perfect balance from the rider to be executed correctly. An unsteady rider will catch the horse in the mouth, and an incorrect automatic release will spoil a horse's jump and confidence. However, if a rider is able to perform it correctly, it is often best to use this release whenever possible. Very useful in show jumping and eventing, where control is very important. Slipping the reins: Not a release, rather, simply letting the reins slide through the hands a bit. It is a very valuable tool all riders should have. To be used when the rider gets behind the motion by accident, when riding drop fences or fences with a downhill landing, or when a horse gets in trouble over a fence (such as catches a leg on a cross-country fence). Allows the rider to release the horse and give him the freedom he needs, without forcing the rider to do one of the other releases (which are inappropriate for drop fences). However, it results in extra long reins on landing, so the rider must be able to immediately gather up the reins and shorten them to the correct length. With experience, riders learn by feel to instinctively choose the correct release. ==Common Faults== Grand Prix fences will sometimes make even the best riders lose the classic position. * Swinging lower leg: this usually occurs if the rider pinches or grips with the knees, lacks contact throughout the whole leg (for example, has no contact with the thigh), or rides with stirrups that are too long to provide correct balance and support. Since the lower leg is the rider's anchor, a swinging lower leg greatly decreases security and can be very dangerous if the rider is jumping complex fences at high speeds. There are two common occasions for the swinging leg. First, the Grand Prix rider may lose position because the fences are so large, and the horse's thrust and motion is very difficult to follow. Riders of this caliber are generally able to compensate for their deviations from the classical position due to skill and experience. Second, this is commonly seen by show hunter riders, because their horses have such power jumps and round bascule that it is hard to stay with the jump. In both cases, however, there are riders able to maintain a classical position. * Toes down/Heels up: This is usually accompanied by the swinging lower leg. Often due to incorrect leg position, too-long stirrup or, in some cases, due to the rider standing on the toe, instead of sinking his or her weight down his lower leg. Again, this places the rider in a very precarious position. Doing this can have the rider too ahead of the horse. A rider jumping ahead. Note the open hip and knee angles, and the fact that her hips are in front of the line made by the stirrup leather. * Lower leg shoved forward: Pushing the lower leg slightly forward is appropriate for some fences (such as cross-country) for added security. However, it is not appropriate for riding on level ground in a manicured arena at low speeds. Shoving the lower leg forward tends to decrease the rider's ability to stay with the motion, placing them in \\"the back seat\\" and risking that they will fall down on their horse's back while over a fence. It is sometimes associated with \\"getting left behind.\\" * Jumping ahead: One of the most common jumping faults. This involves the rider opening the hip angle over the fence, rather than folding back, so that the majority of the body is in front of the line made by the stirrup leather. The lower leg usually swings backward. It places the rider in a very insecure position, since the rider not only loses his or her base of support (the lower leg), but also is in front of the horse's center of motion. This means that the rider will fall forward (and possibly off) if the horse for any reason slows down its motion (stops, runs out, or stumbles). Secondly, this throws the rider's weight over the horse's shoulders, making it very difficult for the horse to take off and harder to get out of trouble on landing. Riders most commonly jump ahead if they are trying to jump for their horse or if they anticipate the take-off and do not wait for the horse to close their hip and knee angles. It is also seen in the hunter arena, as some riders believe it makes their horse's jump look more powerful. This rider has been left behind, due to his horse's huge jump out of the water. He must be sure to slip his reins to prevent catching the horse in the mouth. * Getting \\"left behind\\": When the rider's body is mostly behind the line made by the perpendicular stirrup leather, and behind the horse's motion. This results in the rider placing extra amount of weight on the horse's back. Hitting the horse in the back is a huge fault in the hunter arenas, because it punishes the horse for rounding into the bascule which is essential in those disciplines, and can cause knockdowns in show jumping. However, being behind the motion is not marked down in eventing when riding cross-country. This is because a solid seat slightly behind the motion places the rider in an extremely secure seat (as riders usually fall off over the shoulder of the horse, not the hindquarters), and because a great bascule is not encouraged cross-country. Instead, it is better if the horse jumps slightly flat for most fences, because they are very wide, and because a flat jump is usually a quicker jump, therefore making it easier for the rider to make the time. This position is performed in degrees depending on the type of fence, with most fences where the rider is behind the motion but not putting his seatbones on the horse's back, and others, such as drop fences, where it is essential that the rider keep his or her seat completely in the saddle for security purposes. However, getting left behind sometimes occurs if the rider's upper body is too open and is leaning back before the fence, if the horse takes off from a very long distance (jumps from too far back), or if the rider's lower leg is shoved so far forward in front of the knee that it forces the upper body back. In all cases, the rider must slip the reins to provide the horse freedom of movement to get over the fence. * Snapping up: When the rider throws the upper body upward, quickly opening the hip angle on the landing side. This risks that the rider will catch the horse in the mouth or put too much weight on its back. It also disrupts the horse's jump. It usually occurs when a rider has gotten into the habit of falling forward (usually because the lower leg swings back), and tries to compensate by bringing his or her upper body back too soon before the horse has completed the jump. * Ducking: When the rider bends the hip angles too much and snaps the upper body over one shoulder. This makes the horse carry uneven weight on one side, which makes it more difficult for it to jump. This occurs when the rider has too much weight in one stirrup instead of being evenly centered. This rider has hit his horse in the mouth because he is not releasing sufficiently. * Not releasing: This is a cardinal sin in all riding circles, as it causes the horse to jump flat and, more importantly, can result in the horse detesting jumping because it is associated with pain, which will eventually lead to stopping. A poor release may occur for several reasons. First, the rider may use the reins for support over the fence because he or she has not developed correct balance. This rider should be sure to grab mane to avoid hitting the horse in the mouth. Secondly, a rider may be left behind the motion for various reasons. In these cases, the rider should be sure to slip the reins. Some riders ride this way when they are mounted on strong horses, and they wish to tell the horse to slow down over the fence before landing, or get in the habit of overusing their hands between fences and forget to release. In this case, the rider must make a conscious effort to remember to release the horse in the air. It also occurs when riders plant their hands on the neck over a fence to support their upper body, but the hands are placed too far back to allow adequate rein for the horse, or if the riders keep contact during takeoff but stiffen their elbows so that they don't follow that contact forward over the fence. Occasionally, it appears as if a rider is not releasing enough, when in fact he or she is slipping the reins or performing a correct automatic release. * Incorrect release: When the rider releases by throwing his hands above the horse's neck, into the air, or way down below the neck. This not only looks sloppy, but changes the rider's balance over fences.

The equation is :\\\\frac{dP}{dr}=-\\\\frac{G m}{r^2}\\\\rho\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{P}{\\\\rho c^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi r^3P}{mc^2}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2Gm}{rc^2}\\\\right)^{-1} Here, r is a radial coordinate, and \\\\rho(r) and P(r) are the density and pressure, respectively, of the material at radius r. The quantity m(r), the total mass within r, is discussed below. The equation is derived by solving the Einstein equations for a general time-invariant, spherically symmetric metric. For a solution to the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation, this metric will take the form :ds^2=e^{ u} c^2 \\\\,dt^2 - \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2Gm}{rc^2}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\,dr^2 - r^2\\\\left(d\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi^2\\\\right) where u(r) is determined by the constraint :\\\\frac{d u}{dr}=- \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{P+\\\\rho c^2} \\\\right) \\\\frac{dP}{dr} When supplemented with an equation of state, F(\\\\rho,P)=0, which relates density to pressure, the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation completely determines the structure of a spherically symmetric body of isotropic material in equilibrium. If terms of order 1/c^2 are neglected, the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation becomes the Newtonian hydrostatic equation, used to find the equilibrium structure of a spherically symmetric body of isotropic material when general-relativistic corrections are not important. If the equation is used to model a bounded sphere of material in a vacuum, the zero-pressure condition P(r)=0 and the condition e^{ u} = 1 - 2 G m/c^2 r should be imposed at the boundary. The second boundary condition is imposed so that the metric at the boundary is continuous with the unique static spherically symmetric solution to the vacuum field equations, the Schwarzschild metric: :ds^2=\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\\\right) c^2 \\\\,dt^2 - \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\,dr^2 - r^2(d\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi^2) ==Total mass== m(r) is the total mass contained inside radius r, as measured by the gravitational field felt by a distant observer. It satisfies m(0) = 0. :\\\\frac{dm}{dr}=4 \\\\pi r^2 \\\\rho Here, M is the total mass of the object, again, as measured by the gravitational field felt by a distant observer. If the boundary is at r = R, continuity of the metric and the definition of m(r) require that :M=m(R)=\\\\int_0^{R} 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\rho \\\\, dr Computing the mass by integrating the density of the object over its volume, on the other hand, will yield the larger value :M_1=\\\\int_0^{R} \\\\frac{4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\rho}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{2Gm}{rc^2}}} \\\\, dr The difference between these two quantities, :\\\\delta M=\\\\int_0^{R} 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\rho \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{2Gm}{rc^2}}\\\\right) \\\\, dr will be the gravitational binding energy of the object divided by c^2 and it is negative. ==Derivation from general relativity== Let us assume a static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid. The metric components are similar to those for the Schwarzschild metric: :c^2 \\\\,d\\\\tau^2 = g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\,dx^\\\\mu \\\\,dx^ u = e^{ u} c^2 \\\\,dt^2 - e^{\\\\lambda} \\\\,dr^2 - r^2 \\\\,d\\\\theta^2 - r^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\phi^2 By the perfect fluid assumption, the stress-energy tensor is diagonal (in the central spherical coordinate system), with eigenvalues of energy density and pressure: :T_0^0 = \\\\rho c^2 and :T_i^j = - P \\\\delta_i^j Where \\\\rho(r) is the fluid density and P(r) is the fluid pressure. To proceed further, we solve Einstein's field equations: :\\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\\\mu u} = G_{\\\\mu u} Let us first consider the G_{00} component: :\\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{c^4} \\\\rho c^2 e^ u = \\\\frac{e^ u}{r^2} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{d}{dr} r e^{-\\\\lambda} \\\\right) Integrating this expression from 0 to r, we obtain :e^{-\\\\lambda} = 1 - \\\\frac{2 Gm}{r c^2} where m(r) is as defined in the previous section. Next, consider the G_{11} component. Explicitly, we have :\\\\- \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{c^4} P e^{\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{- r u' + e^{\\\\lambda} - 1}{r^2} which we can simplify (using our expression for e^{\\\\lambda}) to : \\\\frac{d u}{d r} = \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2 G m}{c^2 r}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2 G m}{c^2 r} + \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{c^4} r^2 P\\\\right) We obtain a second equation by demanding continuity of the stress-energy tensor: abla_{\\\\mu} T^{\\\\mu}_{\\\\, u} = 0. Observing that \\\\partial_t \\\\rho = \\\\partial_t P = 0 (since the configuration is assumed to be static) and that \\\\partial_{\\\\phi} P = \\\\partial_{\\\\theta} P = 0 (since the configuration is also isotropic), we obtain in particular :0 = abla_\\\\mu T^\\\\mu_1 = - \\\\frac{d P}{d r} - \\\\frac12 \\\\left(P + \\\\rho c^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{d u}{d r} \\\\; Rearranging terms yields: :\\\\frac{dP}{dr} = - \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\rho c^2 + P}{2} \\\\right) \\\\frac{d u}{dr} \\\\; This gives us two expressions, both containing d u/dr. Eliminating d u/dr, we obtain: :\\\\frac{dP}{dr} = - \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\rho c^2 + P}{2} \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{2 G m}{c^2 r} + \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{c^4} r^2 P\\\\right) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2 G m}{c^2 r}\\\\right)^{-1} Pulling out a factor of G/r and rearranging factors of 2 and c^2 results in the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation: :{cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"border:2px solid #ccccff\\" \\\\frac{dP}{dr} = - \\\\frac{G}{r^2} \\\\left( \\\\rho + \\\\frac{P}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\left(m + 4 \\\\pi r^3 \\\\frac{P}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{2 G m}{c^2 r} \\\\right)^{-1} } ==History== Richard C. Tolman analyzed spherically symmetric metrics in 1934 and 1939. The form of the equation given here was derived by J. Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff in their 1939 paper, \\"On Massive Neutron Cores\\". In this paper, the equation of state for a degenerate Fermi gas of neutrons was used to calculate an upper limit of ~0.7 solar masses for the gravitational mass of a neutron star. Since this equation of state is not realistic for a neutron star, this limiting mass is likewise incorrect. Using gravitational wave observations from binary neutron star mergers (like GW170817) and the subsequent information from electromagnetic radiation (kilonova), the data suggest that the maximum mass limit is close to 2.17 solar masses. Earlier estimates for this limit range from 1.5 to 3.0 solar masses. ==Post-Newtonian approximation== In the Post-Newtonian approximation, i.e., gravitational fields that slightly deviates from Newtonian field, the equation can be expanded in powers of 1/c^2. In other words, we have :\\\\frac{dP}{dr}=-\\\\frac{G m}{r^2}\\\\rho\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{P}{\\\\rho c^2}+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi r^3P}{mc^2}+\\\\frac{2Gm}{rc^2}\\\\right) + O(c^{-4}). ==See also== * Hydrostatic equation * Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff limit * Solutions of the Einstein field equations * Static spherically symmetric perfect fluid ==References== Category:Astrophysics Category:Exact solutions in general relativity ","title":"Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff equation"},{"id":"9154661","text":"Raymond II (died 924) was the Count of Toulouse, N√Æmes, and Albi.

Brown, Jr. ran for a fourth term in this conservative, South Caroline coastal district and faced Democratic candidate Randy Maatta and Green Party candidate James Dunn. Though Brown was re-elected by a comfortable margin, it was a smaller margin than in previous elections. ==District 2== thumb Congressman Joe Wilson ran for re-election in this conservative district that starts along the South Carolina coastline and reaches into the central region of the state. Wilson faced Democratic candidate Michael Ellisor in a repeat of the 2004 election, and, though he was re-elected, his margin of victory was reduced somewhat by the Democratic wave sweeping through the country. ==District 3== thumb Though Congressman J. Gresham Barrett represented the most conservative district in South Carolina, he was held to just over sixty percent of the vote by Democratic candidate Lee Ballenger in 2006, in part due to the anti-Republican sentiment nationwide. ==District 4== thumb Republican Congressman Bob Inglis, seeking his fifth term overall and his second consecutive term, faced off against Democratic candidate William Griffith, Libertarian John Cobin, and Green candidate C. Faye Walters, which he won handily. This district, based in Spartanburg and Greenville, has a tendency to elect Republicans. ==District 5== thumb Long-serving Democratic Congressman John Spratt, in a bid for his thirteenth term, faced a credible challenge from State Representative Ralph Norman. Though Spratt's margin of victory was reduced from previous levels, he was still able to edge out Norman with nearly fifty-seven percent of the vote in this conservative, northern district. ==District 6== thumb Facing off against Republican challenger Gary McLeod for the third time in this staunchly liberal, African-American majority district, incumbent Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn overwhelmingly won election to an eighth term in Congress. ==See also== *United States House of Representatives elections, 2006 *South Carolina gubernatorial election, 2006 *South Carolina state elections, 2006 ==References== ==External links== *South Carolina Election Returns South Carolina 2006 Category:2006 South Carolina elections ","title":"2006 United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina"},{"id":"9154678","text":"Stephen Hunt may refer to: *Stephen Hunt (footballer, born 1956), England, Coventry, Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion footballer *Stephen Hunt (footballer, born 1981), Republic of Ireland footballer playing for Ipswich Town *Stephen Hunt (footballer, born 1984), English footballer *Stephen Hunt (author) (born 1966), British author *Stephen J.
