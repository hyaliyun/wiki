Member species are native to Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Africa. Some other genera of their subfamily Faboideae also have names containing \\"vetch\\", for example the vetchlings (Lathyrus) or the milk-vetches (Astragalus). The broad bean (Vicia faba) is sometimes separated in a monotypic genus Faba; although not often used today, it is of historical importance in plant taxonomy as the namesake of the order Fabales, the Fabaceae and the Faboideae. The tribe Vicieae in which the vetches are placed is named after the genus' current name. Among the closest living relatives of vetches are the lentils (Lens) and the true peas (Pisum). ==Use by humans== Bitter vetch (V. ervilia) was one of the first domesticated crops. It was grown in the Near East about 9,500 years ago, starting perhaps even one or two millennia earlier during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. By the time of the Central European Linear Pottery culture – about 7,000 years ago – broad bean (V. faba) had also been domesticated. Vetch has been found at Neolithic and Eneolithic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. And at the same time, at the opposite end of Eurasia, the Hoabinhian people also utilized the broad bean in their path towards agriculture, as shown by the seeds found in Spirit Cave, Thailand. Bernard of Clairvaux shared a bread-of-vetch meal with his monks during the famine of 1124 to 1126, as an emblem of humility. However, Bitter Vetch largely was dropped from human use over time. It was only used to save as a crop of last resort in times of starvation: vetches \\"featured in the frugal diet of the poor until the eighteenth century, and even reappeared on the black market in the South of France during the Second World War\\", Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, of Marseillais background, has remarked. However, broad beans remained prominent. In the Near East the seeds are mentioned in Hittite and Ancient Egyptian sources dating from more than 3,000 years ago as well as in the Christian Bible, and in the large Celtic Oppidum of Manching from the La Tène culture in Europe some 2,200 years ago. Dishes resembling ful medames are attested in the Jerusalem Talmud which was compiled before 400 AD. Worldwide vetch yield V. pannonica) is often grown for forage. In our time, the common vetch (V. sativa) has also risen to prominence. Together with broad bean cultivars such as horse bean or field bean, the FAO includes it among the 11 most important pulses in the world. The main usage of the common vetch is as forage for ruminant animals, both as fodder and legume, but there are other uses, as tufted vetch, V. cracca is grown as a mid-summer pollen source for honeybees. In 2017, global production of vetches was 920,537 tonnes.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. That year, 560,077 acreas were devoted to the cultivation of vetches in the world. Over 54% of that output came from Europe alone. Africa (17.8% of world total), Asia (15.6% of world total), Americas (10.6% of world total) and Oceania (1.8% of world total).[14] The bitter vetch, too, is grown extensively for forage and fodder, as are hairy vetch (V. villosa, also called fodder vetch), bard vetch (V. articulata), French vetch (V. serratifolia) and Narbon bean (V. narbonensis). V. benghalensis and Hungarian vetch (V. pannonica) are cultivated for forage and green manure. 4-Chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA), a phytohormone found in several vetches The vetches also have a broad variety of other purposes. The Hairy Vetch has well-established uses as a green manure and as an allelopathic cover crop. As regards the broad bean, it is known to accumulate aluminum in its tissue; in polluted soils it may be useful in phytoremediation, but with one per mil of aluminum in the dry plant (possibly more in the seeds), it might not be edible anymore. The robust plants are useful as a beetle bank to provide habitat and shelter for carnivorous beetles and other arthropods to keep down pest invertebrates. When the root nodules of broad bean are inoculated with the rhodospirillacean bacterium Azospirillum brasilense and the glomeracean fungus Glomus clarum, the species can also be productively grown in salty soils. In the 1980s, the auxin 4-Cl-IAA was studied in V. amurensis and the broad bean, and since 1990, the antibacterial γ-thionins fabatin-1 and -2 have been isolated from the latter species. Despite a small chromosome count of n=6, the broad bean has a high DNA content, making it easy for a micronucleus test of its root tips to recognize genotoxic compounds. A lectin from V. graminea is used to test for the medically significant N blood group. ==Toxicity== Leucoagglutinin, a toxic phytohemagglutinin found in raw Vicia faba The vetches grown as forage are generally toxic to non-ruminants (such as humans), at least if eaten in quantity. Cattle and horses have been poisoned by V. villosa and V. benghalensis, two species that contain canavanine in their seeds. Canavanine, a toxic analogue of the amino acid arginine, has been identified in Hairy Vetch as an appetite suppressant for monogastric animals, while Narbon bean contains the quicker-acting but weaker γ-glutamyl-S-ethenylcysteine. In common vetch, γ-glutamyl-β-cyanoalanine has been found. The active part of this molecule is β-cyanoalanine. It inhibits the conversion of the sulfur amino acid methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine, an intermediary product of this biochemical pathway, is secreted in urine. This process can effectively lead to the depletion of vital protective reserves of the sulfur amino acid cysteine and thereby making Vicia sativa seed a dangerous component in mixture with other toxin sources. The Spanish pulse mix ' contains common vetch and bitter vetch in addition to vetchling (Lathyrus cicera) seeds; it can be fed in small quantities to ruminants, but its use as a staple food will cause lathyrism even in these animals. Moreover, common vetch as well as broad bean – and probably other species of Vicia too – contain oxidants like convicine, isouramil, divicine and vicine in quantities sufficient to lower glutathione levels in G6PD-deficient persons to cause favism disease. At least broad beans also contain the lectin phytohemagglutinin and are somewhat poisonous if eaten raw. Split common vetch seeds resemble split red lentils (Lens culinaris), and has been occasionally mislabelled as such by exporters or importers to be sold for human consumption. In some countries where lentils are highly popular – e.g., Bangladesh, Egypt, India and Pakistan – import bans on suspect produce have been established to prevent these potentially harmful scams. ==Ecology== V. nigricans) help to distinguish it from other species. Vetches have cylindrical root nodules of the indeterminate type and are thus nitrogen- fixing plants. Their flowers usually have white to purple or blue hues, but may be red or yellow; they are pollinated by bumblebees, honey bees, solitary bees and other insects. Vicia species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some butterflies and moths, such as: * Coleophora cracella – only found on Vicia species * Coleophora fuscicornis – only found on smooth tare (V. tetrasperma) * Paratalanta pandalis – recorded on bush vetch (V. sepium) * Chionodes lugubrella – recorded on tufted vetch (V. cracca) * Lime- speck pug (Eupithecia centaureata) – recorded on tufted vetch (V. cracca) * Double-striped pug (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata) – recorded on broad bean (V. faba) * Provençal short-tailed blue (Everes alcetas) * Amanda's blue (Polyommatus amandus) – only found on Vicia species * The flame (Axylia putris) * Blackneck (Lygephila pastinum) – recorded on tufted vetch (V. cracca) * Angle shades (Phlogophora meticulosa) * Colias species, e.g., Clouded sulphur (C. philodice) * Wood white (Leptidea sinapis) * Pea moth (Cydia nigricana) Most other parasites and plant pathogens affecting vetches have been recorded on the broad bean, the most widely cultivated and economically significant species. They include the mite Balaustium vignae whose adults are found on broad bean, the potexviruses Alternanthera mosaic virus, clover yellow mosaic virus and white clover mosaic virus, and several other virus species such as Bidens mosaic virus, tobacco streak virus, Vicia cryptic virus and Vicia faba endornavirus. ==Selected species== Vicia amoena V. cassubica) Vicia grandiflora V. pisiformis) Vicia tenuifolia ssp. dalmatica * Vicia americana – American vetch, purple vetch, mat vetch * Vicia amoena * Vicia amurensis Oett.

He negotiated the \\"Harris Treaty\\" between the US and Japan and is credited as the diplomat who first opened Shogunate Japan to foreign trade and culture in the Edo period. ==In New York== Harris was born in the village of Sandy Hill (now Hudson Falls), in Washington County in upstate New York. He moved early to New York City, where he became a successful merchant and importer from China. In 1846 Harris joined the New York City Board of Education, serving as its president until 1848. He was an avid and critical reader and also taught himself French, Italian and Spanish. He founded the Free Academy of the City of New York, which later became the City College of New York, to provide education to the city's working people. A city high school bearing Harris's name, Townsend Harris High School, soon emerged as a separate entity out of the Free Academy's secondary-level curriculum; the school survived until 1942 when Fiorello La Guardia closed it because of budget constraints. Townsend Harris High School was re-created in 1984 as a public magnet school for the humanities. == Harris Treaty of 1856 with Siam == Harris, though anxious to get to his new post in Japan, went first to Bangkok, to update the 1833 Roberts Treaty. In his formal audience with the English-speaking and Western-oriented Second King, Phra Pin Klao, Harris stated America's position: > The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it > desire any. The form of government forbids the holding of colonies. The > United States, therefore, cannot be an object of jealousy to any Eastern > Power. Peaceful commercial relations, which give as well as receive > benefits, is what the President wishes to establish with Siam, and such is > the object of my mission. Finalization of the Bowring Treaty of 1855 delayed Harris for about a month, but he had only to negotiate minor points to transform it into the Harris Treaty of 1856. Re-designated the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, the amendments granted Americans extraterritorial rights in addition to those in the Roberts Treaty. American missionary Stephen Matoon, who had acted as translator, was appointed the first United States consul to Siam.Dennett, Tyler (1922).

Harris demanded the courtesies due to an accredited envoy and refused to deliver his president's letter to anyone but the Shogun in Edo, and to him personally. After prolonged negotiations lasting 18 months, Harris finally received a personal audience with the Shogun in the palace. After another four months, he successfully negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, or the \\"Harris Treaty of 1858,\\" securing trade between the US and Japan and paving the way for greater Western influence in Japan's economy and politics. Harris served during the first Japanese Embassy to the United States, during which a false report reached the US of his death. Harris returned home in 1861. Upon his departure, senior Japanese diplomat Moriyama wrote to him \\"You have been more than a friend. You have been our benefactor and teacher. Your spirit and memory will live forever in the history of Japan.\\" Harris was favorably impressed by his experiences in Japan at the end of its self-imposed period of isolation. He wrote: \\"The people all appeared clean and well-fed... well clad and happy looking. It is more like the golden age of simplicity and honesty than I have ever seen in any other country\\".Quoted in Perrin, p.90 According to a persistent legend, Harris adopted a 17-year-old geisha known as , whose real name was . The legend has it that she was heavily pressured into the relationship by Japanese authorities and then ostracized after Harris' departure, eventually committing suicide in 1892.http://www.cis.doshisha.ac.jp/kkitao/Japan/shimoda/s1.htm However, it appears that Okichi was merely one of Harris' housekeepers, and the Kodansha Encyclopedia states that Harris fired her after just three days of work. ==Aftermath== As reported in The New York Times, when he was interviewed in 1874 by the author William Elliot Griffis who had recently returned from Japan, his first question was, \\"What do the Japanese think of me?\\"Griffis, William.

As We Saw Them: The First Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860). University of California Press (1979), p. 173. Harris is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In 1986, the nation of Japan presented a gift of a refurbished gravesite including paving stones, a stone lantern, a cherry tree, a dogwood tree, and two commemorative stones, in commemoration of the continuing respect and affection of the Japanese people for Harris. ==Portrayal in fiction== Harris was portrayed by John Wayne in the 1958 movie The Barbarian and the Geisha, directed by John Huston. Although the primary plot, dealing with Harris' attempt diplomatically to achieve détente between the U.S. and Japan, is essentially accurate, the subplot dealing with the love affair between Harris and Okichi is substantially fictionalFalk, Ray (January 12, 1958). \\"Shooting a 'Barbarian'; Townsend Harris Biography Is Filmed At Authentic Japanese Locales\\", New York Times. ==See also== * Hotta Masayoshi * List of Westerners who visited Japan before 1868 * Sakoku ==Notes== ==References== * Cosenza, Mario Emilio.

The event was held at two parks simultaneously which shared the same bill; artists performed at one location on Saturday and then swapped on Sunday. The sites were located at Hylands Park in Chelmsford and Weston Park in South Staffordshire. It was announced by Richard Branson on 30 October 2017 that V Festival would be discontinued but that a new festival would replace it. In 2018, a new festival called \\"Rize\\" was held in on the same weekend as the \\"V Festival\\" but only at Hylands Park. However, on 5 August 2020, it was announced that the \\"V Festival\\" was to return to Hylands Park, without an audience (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), later that monthhttps://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/18629655.olly- murs-anne-marie-headline-virtual-v-festival/. The \\"V\\" represented the Virgin Group, with the event being sponsored by Virgin Media. It was originally televised by Channel 4 from 1997 to 2013, predominantly on their sister channel 4 Music, with the exception of the 2003 event with ITV in charge. It was then televised by MTV from 2014 to 2015, and the 2016 edition of the festival was televised by Channel 5. ITV returned to televising the V Festival upon its return in 2020, with coverage hosted by Joel Dommett and Maya Jamahttps://www.braintreeandwithamtimes.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/18629655.olly- murs-anne-marie-headline-virtual-v-festival/. ==History== The idea for V came in 1996 when Pulp's front man Jarvis Cocker said that he would love to play two outdoor venues in two days. Pulp's promoters got together and came up with the idea of putting the gig into Victoria Park Warrington and Hylands Park Chelmsford giving fans in both the North and South a chance to see the band. Then came the idea of adding more bands to the bill, putting on a second stage and letting people camp for the weekend. In the end Victoria Park was just too small for 3 stages and camping. So in August 1996 there was one day of artists in Victoria Park and 2 days at Hylands Park with camping. The northern leg of V97 was switched to Temple Newsam, Leeds to provide room for camping and three stages. In 1999 the Northern leg of the festival was moved to Weston Park in Staffordshire, and has remained there since. Previously it had been held at Temple Newsam in Leeds, before being replaced by Carling's Leeds Festival. Originally, the festival took the name of the current year, with the first festival being named \\"V96\\". Since 2003 it has been known as simply the V Festival. Its weekend format, low queuing times and professional organisation have given it a loyal audience. The festival sold out in record time in 2006. Mel C, Dido, and N.E.R.D. have all performed at the festival, and both Razorlight and Faithless performed in 2006. V showcases a mix of British and international musicians, from up-and-coming bands such as Coldplay in 2000 and the Kaiser Chiefs in 2003 and 2008, and glam rockers El Presidente in 2005, to veteran crooner Tony Christie. Girls Aloud also performed at the 2006 show, and received rave reviews for their performance. V97 was the first V Festival to be webcast. This was audio-only, and had about 30,000 unique listeners. ==Festivals and line-ups by year== ===V96=== The first V festival took place on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 August 1996, and had two stages and one tent. * V stage: Pulp, Paul Weller, Supergrass, The Charlatans, Cast, Lightning Seeds, Gary Numan, Shed Seven, Stereolab, Incognito, Jonathan Richman, The Mike Flowers Pops, Longpigs, Edge Park * 2nd Stage: Elastica, Sleeper, Heavy Stereo, Menswear, Fluffy, The Cardigans, Super Furry Animals, The Wannadies, Denim, Kula Shaker, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Space, Tiger, Pusherman, Orbital * Dance Arena: Tricky, The Aloof, Morcheeba, Lamb, Mad Professor, Alan Hale & Helen Welch ===V97=== This year introduced the NME stage. * V Stage: Blur, The Prodigy, Kula Shaker, Beck, Dodgy, Foo Fighters, Reef, Placebo, Pavement, Fluke, Teenage Fanclub, Apollo 440, The Supernaturals, Echobelly, Linoleum * NME Stage: Ash, The Bluetones, Mansun, Gene, The Divine Comedy, Longpigs, Monaco, Echo & the Bunnymen, Symposium, Geneva, Silver Sun, Veruca Salt, Embrace, Hurricane#1, AC Acoustics, Stereophonics, The Driven, Radish * Virgin High Energy Tent: The Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, Dreadzone, Propellerheads, Death in Vegas, Sneaker Pimps, GusGus, Lionrock, Jimi Tenor, Olive, Finley Quaye, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Carl Cox, Trademark ===V98=== * V Stage: The Verve, The Charlatans, The Seahorses, Texas, Green Day, Robbie Williams, The Lightning Seeds, Space, Iggy Pop, James, Chumbawamba, Stereophonics, Marion, Feeder, Whale, Rialto, Young Offenders, Headswim * NME Stage: Underworld, Fun Lovin' Criminals, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Ian Brown, Catatonia, PJ Harvey, Saint Etienne, Morcheeba, Lo Fidelity Allstars, Republica, Gomez, The Dandy Warhols, The Montrose Avenue, theaudience, Midget, One Lady Owner, Superstar, The Smiles * Dance Tent: James Brown, All Saints, Roni Size, K-Gee, Björn Again, Cornershop, Roachford, 67y, Karen Ramirez, Faithless, Regular Fries, DJ Norman Jay, Tin Star, Lionrock, Dean Thatcher, Moloko, Boom Boom Satellites, Disque Blu, Cuba ===V99=== * V Stage: Manic Street Preachers, Suede, The Beautiful South, Stereophonics, Placebo (withdrew due illness, replaced by Supergrass), Happy Mondays, Cast, The Levellers, Gomez, Faithless, The Cardigans, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Afro Celt Sound System, The Saw Doctors, Melanie C * NME Stage: James Brown, Massive Attack, Super Furry Animals, Mercury Rev, Shed Seven, DJ Shadow, Travis, Gay Dad, dEUS, Red Snapper, A, Death in Vegas, Dot Allison, Eve 6, Liz Horman, YY29, Medal, One Lady Owner * JJB Arena Stage: Orbital, Finley Quaye, lan brown Lamb, Rae & Christian, Freestylers, Sneaker Pimps, The Egg, Groove Armada, Mishka, Richie Hawtin, Luke Slater, Regular Fries, Technique, ManCHILD, Archive * Reebox Arena: Paul Oakenfold, DJ Sneak, Dave Ralph, Derek Carter, Dope Smugglaz, Justin Robertson, Aphrodite, Dave Angel, Jumping Jack Frost, Andy Weatherall, Layo, Mr. C, Matthew B ===V2000=== * Richard Ashcroft (of The Verve) goes solo and Travis unveil their cover of Britney Spears' \\"...Baby One More Time\\" which they had already played at Glastonbury Festival in June 2000. * V Stage: Travis, Richard Ashcroft, Macy Gray, Paul Weller, Ocean Colour Scene, James, All Saints, Cypress Hill, Morcheeba, Barenaked Ladies, Semisonic, Brand New Heavies, The Bootleg Beatles, Björn Again, Andreas Johnson, Toploader * MTV Stage: Supergrass, Moby, Mansun, Beth Orton, Bloodhound Gang, Joe Strummer, Saint Etienne, Feeder, Dum Dums, The Dandy Warhols, Soulwax, Coldplay, Hefner, SX 10, Big Leaves, The Webb Brothers, Pacifica * JJB Puma Arena: Underworld, Leftfield, The Flaming Lips, Death in Vegas, Moloko, Groove Armada, Bentley Rhythm Ace, Kelis, M.

The other main stage headliner was Kings Of Leon, with headliners on other stages including Jamie Cullum, Basement Jaxx and former Swedish House Mafia DJ Steve Angello. For the 2013 festival, one stage was renamed: the stage previously known as 'Virgin Media Undercover Tent' now became known as 'Futures Stage'. A poster released by the organisers initially seemed to suggest that the stage previously known as '4Music Stage' had been renamed as 'Stage 2', leading to speculation that Channel 4 had ended their sponsorship of the event, however a revised version of the poster released later reinstated the original name of the stage. Multiple changes were made to the bill in the days leading up to the festival. Beady Eye were scheduled to headline opposite Beyoncé on the 4Music Stage, however they had to cancel all live shows through August 2013 because of the hospitalisation of member Gem Archer. Thus, their headlining slot on the 4Music Stage was taken over by Steve Angello, whose own previous headlining slot on The Arena Stage was taken over by Ocean Colour Scene. Ocean Colour Scene had themselves previously been scheduled to play an earlier timeslot on the main stage on the opposite day - that slot was taken over by Scouting For Girls, whose previous slot on the 4Music Stage was in turn taken over by previously-unannounced act Reverend and The Makers. In unrelated developments, Little Mix were removed from the line- up for undisclosed reasons, and their fellow The X Factor winner James Arthur also cancelled his appearance the very day before the festival, citing a throat infection. Finally, on the official V Festival lanyard offered to festival attendees upon their arrival on site, it was confirmed that four previously-unannounced acts had been added to the Futures Stage - these were James Bay, Hero Fisher, Gamu Nhengu and Paul McCartney's son James McCartney. The majority of the line-up, with day and stage splits, was announced on 30 May 2013. With the Comedy Stage line-up announced later, as well as the changed outlines above, the full bill ended up as follows: {class=\\" plainlist\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! witdth=26%  Day !! witdth=19%  Virgin Media Stage !! witdth=17%  4Music Stage !! witdth=16%  The Arena Stage !! witdth=15%  Futures Stage !! witdth=10%  Glee Club Comedy Tent - valign=top align=center  * * Weston Park Sunday  * Beyoncé * The Script * Jessie J * Two Door Cinema Club * Paloma Faith * James * Deacon Blue * The Fratellis  * Steve Angello * The Courteeners * Fun. * Labrinth * Of Monsters & Men * Maverick Sabre * Lissie * Conor Maynard * The Pigeon Detectives  * Ocean Colour Scene * DJ Fresh/Live * Travis * Mark Owen * Katy B * Jessie Ware * Netsky Live! * Gabrielle Aplin * Idris Elba * Nina Nesbitt * K-Koke  * Benjamin Francis Leftwich Monsta * Misha B * Hoffmaestro * Sam Smith * Tori Kelly * A*M*E * Goldie Lookin' Chain * Nell Bryden * Ed Drewett * Moya * Silhouette * Vox Empire  * Eddie Izzard * Josh Widdicombe * Shappi Korsandi * Katherine Ryan * Andrew Bird * David Fulton * Eddy Brimson * Danny Slim Gray * Suzi Ruffell * Andrew Ryan * Nathan Caton * Justin Moorhouse * MC: Mark Olver - valign=top align=center  * Hylands Park Sunday / * Weston Park Saturday  * Kings of Leon * Stereophonics * Emeli Sande * The Vaccines * Olly Murs * Jason Mraz * Scouting For Girls * The Saturdays  * Calvin Harris * Rita Ora * Kendrick Lamar * Maxïmo Park * Rudimental * Seasick Steve * Tom Odell * Reverend & The Makers * The Heavy * Lawson  * Basement Jaxx * Jaguar Skills * Ellie Goulding * Eels * Lianne La Havas * McFly * Everything Everything * Laura Mvula * John Newman * 5ive * The Original Rudeboys  * Jamie Cullum * Naughty Boy * Lewis Watson * The Skints * Lucy Spraggan * Diana Vickers * James Skelly & The Intenders * Exit Calm * James Bay * James McCartney *Hero Fisher * Gamu  * Jon Richardson * Paul Chowdhry * Rob Beckett * Andrew O'Neill * Ricky Grover * Imran Yusuf * Joel Dommett * Mark Simmons * Elis James * Fredrik Andersson * Peter Johansson * Angela Barnes * MC: Kevin McCarthy } ===V Festival 2014=== The 2014 V Festival was the first to be staged with the new shareholders Live Nation and new broadcaster and sponsor MTV, took place over the weekend of 16–17 August 2014.

The program was based on the 1996 book The Ferocious Beast with the Polka-Dot Hide and its sequels, all of which were also written by the Paraskevases. The show began as a series of shorts aired on the Canadian channel Teletoon in 1998. The first full-length episode premiered on Teletoon on August 26, 2000. The series ran for three seasons, airing its final episode on June 9, 2002. ==Premise== A young girl named Maggie creates her own map of an imaginary world known as \\"Nowhere Land\\" that, in reality, takes the characters nowhere. She imagines that characters Beast and Hamilton Hocks are her friends. ==Episodes== ==Characters== ===Main=== * Maggie (voiced by Kristen Bone) is a five-year-old girl (who later turns six years old) and the human protagonist of the show. She is Hamilton's and Beast's best friend. They both look up to Maggie very much and always turn to her for advice. Maggie is the leader of the group and is always there to be the compassionate voice of reason to her dear friends. * The Ferocious Beast (voiced by Stephen Ouimette) appears ferocious, but is actually gentle and kind. He is yellow, with big red removable spots, and three horns on his head. He often wears multi-colored galoshes which he pronounces as \\"Goo-lashes\\". His favorite catchphrase is \\"Great googly moogly!\\", which he says several times per episode. In \\"Hide And Go Beast\\", it is shown that he is allergic to pollen. Beast loves pretty much any kind of food, especially Hamilton's cooking, and is almost always hungry. He even loves baths. Maggie and Hamilton are his best friends. Hamilton often corrects his pronunciation, but he does not believe him. * Hamilton Hocks (voiced by Michael Caruana) is a pig who can be bossy and quite fussy, but he has a warm heart. He lives inside a portable cardboard box which he loves, is the best cook in Nowhere Land, and is a total clean freak. Hamilton's most prized possessions are his beautiful \\"H\\" sweater and his cardboard box, which also happens to be his home. Maggie and the Beast are his best friends. ===Recurring=== * Rudy the Mouse (Voiced by John McGrath): Rudy is a cheese- loving mouse who lives in a large wheel of cheese in a part of Nowhere Land called Cheese Town. It is revealed in one episode that Rudy's hat and boots do not come off because they are glued to him. Strangely enough, this character started off with the name Pippy but was renamed by the writers soon after. * Nedley the Rabbit (Voiced by Dwayne Hill): Nedley speaks in rhymes. He says rhymes almost all through every episode that he appears in, but sometimes he talks normally a little bit before starting his rhyme again. Nedley lives in a rabbit hole next to his carrot patch in Nowhere Land. * The Moo Sisters (Mavis voiced by Tamara Bernier): They are the three cows who live in a part of Nowhere Land called Mooville. They love to sing and do it often. They are sisters and their names are Millicent, Mavis and Marge. * Mr. Moon: He is the only non-human and non-animal character in the episode \\"Blue Moon\\". He is usually grumpy because people say he is made of green cheese. * The Kindly Giant: The Kindly Giant is not at all scary but instead kind hearted. The others are scared at first but they soon get used to him and they sometimes go to him for advice or a favour. He refers to Maggie, Hamilton and the Beast as little ones. He owns a garden full of fruits and vegetables, from which he always lets the ever hungry Beast scarf up a giant blueberry or two. His face is never shown, and he only appears in a few episodes. He is big and strong. Even the Beast seems small compared to the giant. The Kindly Giant lives in an area of Nowhere Land where all the fruits and vegetables are giant sized. Usually, only his shoes and ankles are seen due to his largeness. * The Dream Sheep: White sheep that make \\"baa\\" sounds. They are occasionally up in the clouds. * The Jellybean Team: They are a group of seven jellybeans. There is a red one, an orange one, a yellow one, a purple one, a black one and two green ones. They are small, of course, but have big personalities. They also tend to argue with each other a lot because they each think they are more important than the others. * The Triplets (All voiced by Julie Lemieux): Maggie's baby cousins (Zack, Max, and Oscar). They only appear in four episodes, \\"One, Two, Three\\", \\"Home of the Kindly Giant\\", \\"The New Rubber Ball\\" and \\"Which Way Did They Go?\\". * Big Duck: A large duck with white feathers who lives in the water. She is the focus of the episode \\"The Big Duck\\" and appears in the series' theme song. * Reggie Van Beast (Voiced by Dan Chameroy): Beast's cousin. His coloring is the inverse of Beast's, being red with yellow spots, and he wears a monocle. He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \\"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\\". ==Production== The theme song for the show is \\"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\\" which is an original song by Isabella Molley. Maggie and the Ferocious Beast is produced by Nelvana and produced with the participation of Teletoon, and directed by Jamie Whitney and Stuart Shankly. The series debuted in 2000 and the series aired its last episode in 2002. The show is distributed by Nelvana. ==Broadcast== In Canada, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast aired on Teletoon and Treehouse TV. In the United States, it aired on Nickelodeon as part of its Nick Jr. block from June 5, 2000, to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel Noggin (now Nick Jr.) from April 7, 2003, until September 27, 2009, when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010.

Some tracks on Mark II are up-beat with only few lyrics and could also be characterized as dance or techno. The lyrics are old stories from Danish folk tradition, about jealousy, murder, mythology and creatures. In \\"Kirstin\\" from Mark II a father serves his daughter a meal of her boyfriend's heart. In \\"Ulver\\" from III a man takes his girlfriend into the forest to kill and bury her. He falls asleep and she cuts him into pieces with his own sword.

Religiosity is the pivot around which the music and amusements of the village folk of Bihar revolve. There are songs like sohar - performed during childbirth, sumangali - associated with wedding, ropnigeet - performed during the season of sowing paddy, katnigeet - performed during the paddy harvesting season. The influence of Bihari music is seen in regions such as Mauritius, South Africa and the Caribbean, where many Bihari indentured labourers were taken during the nineteenth century as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh where many Bihari Muslims migrated to after the partition of India. There is a great tradition of folk songs started by Bhikhari Thakur, an artist from the Bhojpur region. In the field Bhojpuri Music and Songs, there are notable works done by Mahendar Misir, Radhamohan Chaubey 'Anjan', Laxman Pathak Pradeep, and Sharda Sinha. Other wandering folk singers include the Kathaks, who travelled in groups and performed accompanied by dholak, sarangi, tamburu and majira. Other musician classes included Roshan Chouki, Bhajaniya, Kirtaniya, Pamaria and Bhakliya. 'Harkirtan' are famous religious folk songs. 'Astajam' are also famous religious folk songs in which 'Hare-Rama, Hare-Krishna' is sung regularly for twenty four hours at Hindu religious places. In Bihar there is Caste Bhatt (Brahma Bhatt) whose tradition is singing and music. Although with the passage of time they have left there profession. Some small groups also sings Sohar songs at the birth time. Some transgender people (Kinners) also sing for livelihood money. In village particularly some theatres are popular. 'Chand- Bijali' are very popular singer and dancer with their group from Village-Natwar of District-Sasaram. Her songs are very realistic although sometimes become little vulgar but liked by people. An example of a very popular and unique folk dance is the Launda (Babua) Dance, in which male children dress themselves in female attire and dance in the female role. This is accompanied by folk song. This art is dying because artists do not get proper money and they do not get proper social respect. They never receive any awards. There are many small groups who go to villages and sing folk songs and play Dholak, Harmonium etc. They are called by some 'STREET SINGERS'. They are the real Folk Singers today who are waiting for recognition, respect and money. Small theatres are also important who give opportunities to small unrecognised artists. They are real entertainers, but sometimes they become vulgar. 'BABUA MANDALI' is working for development and restoration of the rich heritage of Folk Songs and Music of Bihar. Popular Male dancers are called 'Babua Dancer' not Launda Dancer. Female dancers are called 'Babuni Dancers' not Bar Dancers. 'Babua Mandali' have sung a popular 'CHAITA' song about the Great Tribal freedom fighter 'NILAMBAR-PITAMBER' of Latehar District of Jharkhand State which was earlier in Bihar State. Chero and Kharwar tribe of Palamu comissionory sing 'CHAITA' folk song in the month of chait. ==References== Category:Culture of Bihar Bihar ","title":"Music of Bihar"},{"id":"1422246","text":"Simulation result for formation of inversion channel (electron density) and attainment of threshold voltage (IV) in a nanowire MOSFET. Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45 V. The threshold voltage, commonly abbreviated as Vth, of a field-effect transistor (FET) is the minimum gate-to-source voltage VGS (th) that is needed to create a conducting path between the source and drain terminals. It is an important scaling factor to maintain power efficiency. When referring to a junction field-effect transistor (JFET), the threshold voltage is often called \\"pinch-off voltage\\" instead. This is somewhat confusing since pinch off applied to insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET) refers to the channel pinching that leads to current saturation behaviour under high source–drain bias, even though the current is never off. Unlike pinch off, the term threshold voltage is unambiguous and refers to the same concept in any field-effect transistor. ==Basic principles== In n-channel enhancement-mode devices, a conductive channel does not exist naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate- to-source voltage is necessary to create one such. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a depletion region, and the voltage at which this occurs is the threshold voltage of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called inversion. The reverse is true for the p-channel \\"enhancement-mode\\" MOS transistor. When VGS = 0 the device is “OFF” and the channel is open / non- conducting. The application of a negative (-ve) gate voltage to the p-type \\"enhancement-mode\\" MOSFET enhances the channels conductivity turning it “ON”. In contrast, n-channel depletion-mode devices have a conductive channel naturally existing within the transistor. Accordingly, the term threshold voltage does not readily apply to turning such devices on, but is used instead to denote the voltage level at which the channel is wide enough to allow electrons to flow easily. This ease-of-flow threshold also applies to p-channel depletion-mode devices, in which a negative voltage from gate to body/source creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions. For the n-channel depletion MOS transistor, a negative gate-source voltage, -VGS will deplete (hence its name) the conductive channel of its free electrons switching the transistor “OFF”. Likewise for a p-channel \\"depletion-mode\\" MOS transistor a positive gate-source voltage, +VGS will deplete the channel of its free holes turning it “OFF”. In wide planar transistors the threshold voltage is essentially independent of the drain–source voltage and is therefore a well defined characteristic, however it is less clear in modern nanometer-sized MOSFETs due to drain-induced barrier lowering. In the figures, the source (left side) and drain (right side) are labeled n+ to indicate heavily doped (blue) n-regions. The depletion layer dopant is labeled NA− to indicate that the ions in the (pink) depletion layer are negatively charged and there are very few holes. In the (red) bulk the number of holes p = NA making the bulk charge neutral. If the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage (left figure), the \\"enhancement-mode\\" transistor is turned off and ideally there is no current from the drain to the source of the transistor. In fact, there is a current even for gate biases below the threshold (subthreshold leakage) current, although it is small and varies exponentially with gate bias. If the gate voltage is above the threshold voltage (right figure), the \\"enhancement-mode\\" transistor is turned on, due to there being many electrons in the channel at the oxide-silicon interface, creating a low- resistance channel where charge can flow from drain to source. For voltages significantly above the threshold, this situation is called strong inversion. The channel is tapered when because the voltage drop due to the current in the resistive channel reduces the oxide field supporting the channel as the drain is approached. ==Body effect== The body effect is the change in the threshold voltage by an amount approximately equal to the change in the source-bulk voltage, V_{SB}, because the body influences the threshold voltage (when it is not tied to the source). It can be thought of as a second gate, and is sometimes referred to as the back gate,and accordingly the body effect is sometimes called the back-gate effect.Marco Delaurenti, PhD dissertation, Design and optimization techniques of high-speed VLSI circuits (1999)) For an enhancement-mode nMOS MOSFET, the body effect upon threshold voltage is computed according to the Shichman–Hodges model,NanoDotTek Report NDT14-08-2007, 12 August 2007 which is accurate for older process nodes, using the following equation: ::V_{TN} = V_{TO} + \\\\gamma\\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\left V_{SB} - 2\\\\phi_F \\\\right} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\left 2\\\\phi_F \\\\right} \\\\right) where V_{TN} is the threshold voltage when substrate bias is present, V_{SB} is the source-to-body substrate bias, 2\\\\phi_F is the surface potential, and V_{TO} is threshold voltage for zero substrate bias, \\\\gamma = \\\\left(t_{ox}/\\\\epsilon_{ox}\\\\right)\\\\sqrt{2q\\\\epsilon_\\\\text{Si} N_A} is the body effect parameter, t_{ox} is oxide thickness, \\\\epsilon_{ox} is oxide permittivity, \\\\epsilon_\\\\text{Si} is the permittivity of silicon, N_A is a doping concentration, q is elementary charge. ==Dependence on oxide thickness== In a given technology node, such as the 90-nm CMOS process, the threshold voltage depends on the choice of oxide and on oxide thickness. Using the body formulas above, V_{TN} is directly proportional to \\\\gamma, and t_{OX}, which is the parameter for oxide thickness. Thus, the thinner the oxide thickness, the lower the threshold voltage. Although this may seem to be an improvement, it is not without cost; because the thinner the oxide thickness, the higher the subthreshold leakage current through the device will be. Consequently, the design specification for 90-nm gate-oxide thickness was set at 1 nm to control the leakage current.Sugii, Watanabe and Sugatani. Transistor Design for 90-nm Generation and Beyond. (2002) This kind of tunneling, called Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling.S. M. Sze, Physics of Semiconductor Devices, Second Edition, New York: Wiley and Sons, 1981, pp. 496-504. ::I_{fn} = C_1WL(E_{ox})^2e^{-\\\\frac{E_0}{E_{ox}}} where C_1 and E_0 are constants and E_{ox} is the electric field across the gate oxide. Before scaling the design features down to 90 nm, a dual-oxide approach for creating the oxide thickness was a common solution to this issue. With a 90 nm process technology, a triple-oxide approach has been adopted in some cases.Anil Telikepalli, Xilinx Inc, Power considerations in designing with 90 nm FPGAs (2005)) One standard thin oxide is used for most transistors, another for I/O driver cells, and a third for memory-and-pass transistor cells. These differences are based purely on the characteristics of oxide thickness on threshold voltage of CMOS technologies. ==Temperature dependence== As with the case of oxide thickness affecting threshold voltage, temperature has an effect on the threshold voltage of a CMOS device. Expanding on part of the equation in the body effect section ::\\\\phi_F = \\\\left(\\\\frac{kT}{q}\\\\right) \\\\ln{\\\\left(\\\\frac{n_i}{N_A}\\\\right)} where \\\\phi_F is half the contact potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, q is the elementary charge, N_A is a doping parameter and n_i is the intrinsic doping parameter for the substrate. We see that the surface potential has a direct relationship with the temperature. Looking above, that the threshold voltage does not have a direct relationship but is not independent of the effects. This variation is typically between −4 mV/K and −2 mV/K depending on doping level.Weste and Eshraghian, Principles of CMOS VLSI Design : a systems perspective, Second Edition, (1993) pp.48 For a change of 30 °C this results in significant variation from the 500 mV design parameter commonly used for the 90-nm technology node. ==Dependence on random dopant fluctuation== Random dopant fluctuation (RDF) is a form of process variation resulting from variation in the implanted impurity concentration. In MOSFET transistors, RDF in the channel region can alter the transistor's properties, especially threshold voltage. In newer process technologies RDF has a larger effect because the total number of dopants is fewer.Asenov, A. Huang,Random dopant induced threshold voltage lowering and fluctuations in sub-0.1 μm MOSFET's: A 3-D “atomistic” simulation study, Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions, 45 , Issue: 12 Research works are being carried out in order to suppress the dopant fluctuation which leads to the variation of threshold voltage between devices undergoing same manufacturing process.Asenov, A.

The two largest blocs were Herut and the Liberal Party, which had formed the Gahal alliance between 1965 and 1973. In 1973 the two parties were joined by the Free Centre, the Independent Centre (a breakaway from the Free Centre), the National List and the Movement for Greater Israel.

Hook was born on 26 September 1917 and was educated at Canford School, Dorset, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after which he was commissioned into the Unattached List of the Indian Army on 27 January 1938. From 1 April 1938 he was attached to the 1st battalion the Queen's Regiment. He was admitted to the Indian Army on 27 November 1939 and posted to the Royal Deccan Horse (9th Horse). He was promoted lieutenant on 27 April 1940 and captain on 27 January 1946. During the Second World War Hook served in New Guinea and Burma. He transferred to the 7th Hussars (later the Queen's Own Hussars) as a Captain on 28 June 1947. Later postings included Aden, Germany, Hong Kong, and the Sudan. He was promoted major on 27 January 1951 and finally retired the service as an honorary lieutenant-colonel on 13 October 1964. Hook became famous with the British public in the 1980s as the result of a BBC documentary entitled Home from the Hill directed by Molly Dineen. This portrayed him as having led a full life of adventure in the British Empire, before coming home to an England which had changed out of all recognition to the one he remembered. Memorable scenes included Hook relaxing on the veranda of the game lodge he ran in Kenya while an African servant mowed the lawn, and back in England attempting to operate a kitchen appliance and voicing his displeasure at a pop music act on television. The documentary was based on Hook's autobiographical book Home from the Hill, in which he describes participation in activities such as pig- sticking, elephant hunting and polo. It deals with the themes of colonialism, international development, and the end of the British Empire – in particular, through his alienation from the modern world having lived all his life in a vastly different culture. The phrase 'home from the hill' is from a line of Robert Louis Stevenson's poem \\"Requiem\\": Home is the sailor, home from sea, And the hunter home from the hill. On his return to England, Hook settled at Westbury, Wiltshire. On 12 June 1987, the night after the British General Election, he appeared on a memorable edition of After Dark on Channel 4.After Dark article, accessed 30 March 2009 He died in September 1990 at the age of 82. ==See also== * Sudan Defence Force ==References== * Molly Dineen's CV, with details of Home from the Hill documentary * London Gazette (various dates) * Indian Army List (various dates) * The Half-Yearly Army List, February 1950 Category:1917 births Category:1990 deaths Category:7th Queen's Own Hussars officers Category:British Indian Army officers Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Indian Army personnel of World War II Category:People educated at Canford School Category:Queen's Own Hussars officers Category:Royal Tank Regiment officers ","title":"Hilary Hook"},{"id":"1422257","text":"Hassan Massoudy (حسن المسعود الخطاط), born in 1944, is an Iraqi painter and calligrapher, considered by the French writer Michel Tournier as the \\"greatest living calligrapher\\",cited in Caravanes, Vol. 1, Phébus, 1989 currently lives in Paris.

Her Chambre bleue (the \\"blue room\\" of her hôtel particulier) offered a Parisian refuge from the dangerous political factionalism and coarse manners of the royal court during the regency of Louis XIV. One of the central figures of the salon that gathered at the Hôtel de Rambouillet was Madeleine de Scudéry. She wrote voluminous romance novels that embodied the refinements of preciosité including the concepts of feminine elegance, etiquette and courtly Platonic love that were hugely popular with female audiences, but scorned by most men, including Molière, who satirized the Précieuses in his comedy Les Précieuses ridicules (1659). The \\"questions of love\\" that were debated in the précieuses' salons reflected the \\"courts of love\\" (fictional courts which judged lovers' behavior) that were a feature of medieval courtly love. None of the women ever actually used or defined the term Précieuse themselves.The first use of précieuse to denote a literary patron of formidable powers of taste and judgment dates to 1654, according to W. Zimmer, Di literarische Kritik am Preciösentum 1978:51, noted in Patricia Howard, \\"The Influence of the Précieuses on Content and Structure in Quinault's and Lully's Tragédies Lyriques\\" Acta Musicologica 63.1 (January 1991, pp. 57-72) p 58, note. Myriam Maître has found in préciosité not so much a listable series of characteristics \\"as an interplay of forces, a place to confront and resolve the tensions that extended through the century, the court and the field of literature\\".\\"...Qu'un jeu de forces, un lieu d'affrontement et réglage mutuel de certaines des tensions qui traversent le siècle, la cour et le champ littéraire\\". Myriam Maître, Les Précieuses: naissance des femmes de lettres en France au XVIIe siècle (Paris:Champion) 1999:19. In assessing the career of Philippe Quinault, which began at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1653, Patricia Howard noted, \\"For if in French theatre in the second half of the century, women's roles are preeminent, it was the précieux movement which made them so.\\"Howard 1991:58. One préciosité parlor game, the retelling of fairy tales as if spontaneously (though the tales were in fact carefully prepared), was to have great effects.Terri Windling, Les Contes des Fées: The Literary Fairy Tales of France Many of these fairy tales, in the préciosité style, were written, mostly notably by Madame d'Aulnoy. This fashion for fairy tales, and the writers themselves, were a notable influence later upon Charles Perrault,Jack Zipes, When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition, pp. 38-42 and Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve, the author of Beauty and the Beast.Terri Windling, Beauty and the Beast The stories tended to vary from the folk tradition, for example the characters were made to be of genteel origin.Paul Delarue, The Borzoi Book of French Folk-Tales, p xi, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York 1956 Whilst the heroes and heroines of fairy tales written by the précieuses often appeared as shepherds and shepherdesses, in pastoral settings, these figures were often secretly royal or noble.Lewis Seifert, \\"The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the Contes de Fées in Late Seventeenth Century France\\", Jack Zipes, ed., The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, pp. 920-1, The précieuses are also remembered through the filter of Molière's one-act satire, Les Précieuses ridicules (1659). After years touring the provinces, this bitter comedy of manners brought Molière and his company to the attention of Parisians and attracted the patronage of Louis XIV. Les Précieuses ridicules is considered to be the origin of the pejorative connotation of précieuse as \\"affected\\". The phenomenon of the précieuses in establishing French literary classicism was first revived by Louis Roederer in 1838. His Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de la société polie en France, evoked an atmosphere of nostalgia for the douceur de vivre of the Ancien Régime and the aristocratic leisure of its authors, at least for the upper classes. Later, Roxane, a critical character in Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, is described as a précieuse. René Bary (died in 1680) a French historiographer and rhetorician wrote La Rhétorique française où pour principale augmentation l'on trouve les secrets de nostre langue published in Paris in 1653 for the female audience of the précieuses. ==Notes== ==References== *Howard, Patricia, \\"Quinault, Lully, and the Precieuses: Images of Women in Seventeenth-Century France.\\" in Cecilia Reclaimed: Feminist Perspectives on Gender and Music ed.

Based on first-hand field research by several ethnographers in the 1990s, people who self-identify as Chuvans seem to do so by living in small villages and in the tundra in areas that are primarily associated with reindeer herding. ==History== Historical accounts describe the Chuvans as a Yukaghir group. They roamed along the upper tributaries of the Anadyr River and Anyuy River in the 17th century. The Chuvans were engaged in hunting, fishing and reindeer-breeding. In the 18th century, some Chuvans retreated to the Kolyma River following attacks by the Chukchi. There they gradually russified. The other part was assimilated by the Koryaks and Chukchis. According to the 2002 Russian Census, there were 1087 Chuvans in Russia. ==Language== The Chuvan language, which was a Yukaghir language, became extinct in the early 1900s.

On the other hand, some, such as those living in the village of Markovo on the Anadyr River, neither herd reindeer nor are they able to speak Chukchi.

The terminology for various degrees of inversion is described by Tsividis. In digital circuits, subthreshold conduction is generally viewed as a parasitic leakage in a state that would ideally have no current. In micropower analog circuits, on the other hand, weak inversion is an efficient operating region, and subthreshold is a useful transistor mode around which circuit functions are designed. In the past, the subthreshold conduction of transistors has usually been very small in the off state, as gate voltage could be significantly below threshold; but as voltages have been scaled down with transistor size, subthreshold conduction has become a bigger factor. Indeed, leakage from all sources has increased: for a technology generation with threshold voltage of 0.2 V, leakage can exceed 50% of total power consumption. The reason for a growing importance of subthreshold conduction is that the supply voltage has continually scaled down, both to reduce the dynamic power consumption of integrated circuits (the power that is consumed when the transistor is switching from an on-state to an off-state, which depends on the square of the supply voltage), and to keep electric fields inside small devices low, to maintain device reliability. The amount of subthreshold conduction is set by the threshold voltage, which sits between ground and the supply voltage, and so has to be reduced along with the supply voltage. That reduction means less gate voltage swing below threshold to turn the device off, and as subthreshold conduction varies exponentially with gate voltage (see MOSFET: Cut-off Mode), it becomes more and more significant as MOSFETs shrink in size. Subthreshold conduction is only one component of leakage: other leakage components that can be roughly equal in size depending on the device design are gate-oxide leakage and junction leakage. Understanding sources of leakage and solutions to tackle the impact of leakage will be a requirement for most circuit and system designers. ==Sub-threshold electronics == Some devices exploit sub-threshold conduction to process data without fully turning on or off. Even in standard transistors a small amount of current leaks even when they are technically switched off. Some sub- threshold devices have been able to operate with between 1 and 0.1 percent of the power of standard chips. Such lower power operations allow some devices to function with the small amounts of power that can be scavenged without an attached power supply, such as a wearable EKG monitor that can run entirely on body heat. ==See also== * Integrated circuit * Moore's law * Subthreshold slope ==References== ==Further reading== * draft version 2013-09-25 --> (455 pages) Category:Transistor modeling Category:Electric current Category:MOSFETs ","title":"Subthreshold conduction"},{"id":"1422293","text":"Hard Rain is a live album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on September 13, 1976 by Columbia Records.

Travelling bards are a historic part of the country's heritage. In the 11th century, Odissi music was codified into a classical style, related to other styles of Indian classical music. It has been noted that the Odissi music is a type of ancient Indian classical music known as Odramagadhi music, different from the more famous Hindustani & Karnatik musics. ==Overview== Like Hindustani and Carnatic systems, Odissi music is a classical music and a part of Ancient Odramagadhi music,[ which all the essential as well as potential ingredients of Indian classical form. But it has not risen to prominence due to apathy from the time of British rule in Odisha.[ Despite this, the traditional music form could be saved because of the supported efforts given by Jaga Akhadas of Puri district, who preserved its tradition. The music movement of Odisha, however, took a different turn after independence. The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories: # Tribal music # Folk music # Light music # Light-Classical music # Classical music The tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population. They are distributed over 62 tribal communities. Odisha has folk songs which are sung on different festivals and specific occasions for their own enjoyment. Folk music in general is the expression of the ethos and mores of the folk communities. Of the variety of folk music of Odisha, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, Kela Keluni Geeta, Dalkhai Geeta, Kendra Geeta, Jaiphula Geeta, Ghumura Geeta, Ghoda Nacha and Danda Nacha Geeta, Gopal Ugala and Osa-Parva-Geeta. Bhajan, Janan, Odiya songs based on ragas, Rangila Chaupadi are grouped under light classical music, which forms a segment of Oriya music. Sri Geetagovinda, Anirjukta Pravadha, Divya Manusi Prabandha, Chautisa, Chhanda, Chaupadi (now known as Orissi), Champu, Malasri, Sariman, Vyanjani, Chaturang, Tribhang, Kuduka Geeta, Laxana and Swaramalika are the various sub-forms, which individually or collectively constitute the traditional Odissi music.

The Rustavi Ensemble, or the Georgian State Academic Ensemble, is a Georgian folk music ensemble that was created in 1968 by Anzor Erkomaishvili, a singer and folklorist from a distinguished Georgian musical lineage that goes back seven generations. Since its formation Rustavi has successfully toured more than 50 countries of the world. ==Features== Songs and dances for work and war, spectacular costumes, the unique Georgian style of polyphonic singing and rich voices characterize the Rustavi Choir. Their sacred hymns with their overlapping, continuously moving harmonies are spellbinding. Rustavi is also performing a high-quality comprising national and diverse traditional dances. Excellent costumes, brilliant performance, and elaborate choreography. Erkomaishvili's vision was to break through ethnic boundaries of regional styles while performing ethnographically authentic music from all of Georgia. The Rustavi's performance style synthesizes the powerful, rough-hewn sound characteristic of the traditional regional folk choirs with a newer, cleaner, more finely-honed aesthetic whose orientation is towards concert presentation - nowadays on an increasingly international scale. While striving to preserve, and in some cases recreate, authentic voicings and vocal timbres, the Rustavi singers have simplified the complex scales used by the earlier choirs in order to create firmer, more brilliant harmonies. The use of a smaller number of singers for certain songs has also helped to clarify their musical structure. ==Awards== The UNESCO Pacha Prize has been awarded in 2001 to the Rustavi State Academic Ensemble of Singing and Dancing for the safeguarding and promotion of Georgian polyphonic singing in the Republic of Georgia. ==Recordings== In 1998, the group recorded the CD Mirangula under the name Rustavi Folk Choir, which has allowed for a wider appreciation of their music outside Georgia.

After Franklin Roosevelt's election in 1932, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman (right), Under Secretary of the Interior Jebby Davidson (center), and President Harry S. Truman, (December 21, 1950). In 1939, Chapman was an early victim of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, as then- chairman Martin Dies, Jr. published a list of the government employees who were members of a Communist-controlled organization (Chapman was considered a member because there was a record that he had contributed two dollars to the American League for Peace and Democracy, which was raising money for the loyalists during the Spanish Civil War). At the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, Chapman was impressed by Truman sticking to his early agreement to support the current Vice-President Henry A. Wallace. He was promoted to serve as the Under-Secretary by President Harry S. Truman in 1946. Chapman was one of Truman's advisers supporting the decision to recognize the state of Israel in May 1948 over the objections of the State Department. Chapman worked to promote Truman in 1948 election, and late in 1949, was promoted to serve as Secretary of the Interior, replacing to Julius A. Krug, who had not supported Truman's campaign. In 1951, Chapman denied a government loan to the aluminum company being run by Lea M. Harvey, because of a scandal that Harvey had sold artillery shells to the Navy during World War II that were dangerously out of specification. After end of his service in the Department of the Interior, he practiced law in the firm of Chapman, Duff, and Paul. == Personal life and family == On December 21, 1920, at aged 24, Chapman married his first wife, Olga Pauline Edholm, from the Methodist.

It is usually printed above but can be occasionally below (when it is upside down) the note to be extended. When a fermata is placed over a bar or double-bar, it is used to indicate the end of a phrase or section of a work. In a concerto, it indicates the point at which the soloist is to play a cadenza.The Oxford Dictionary of Music, p. 293 A fermata can occur at the end of a piece (or movement) or in the middle of a piece. It can be followed by either a brief rest or more notes.McElheran, Conducting Technique, Chapter XVII, \\"Fermatas\\", p. 85. The author classifies them into three types: fermatas followed by uninterrrupted sound, fermatas followed \\"by a short period of silence,\\" and fermatas \\"followed by a long period of silence.\\" After that classification, the author gives detailed advice for conducting each type. Other names for a fermata are corona (Italian), point d'orgue (French), Fermate (German), calderón (Spanish), suspensão (Portuguese). ==History and use== right This symbol appears as early as the 15th century. It is quite common in the works of Guillaume Du Fay and Josquin des Prez. In chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach and other composers of the Baroque, the fermata often signifies only the end of a phrase, and a breath is to be taken. In a few organ compositions, the fermatas occur in different measures for the right and left hands and for the feet, which would make holding them impractical. \\"In the older music the sign for the fermata is used, as frequently by Bach, merely as indicating the end of the piece, after a Da Capo, when modern composers usually write the word 'fine.' It does not then imply any pause in the music between the first and second part of the number.\\" In the classical and baroque eras, fermatas were usually points at which performers were expected to improvise cadenzas commensurate with its place in the score: in the middle of a movement required short cadenzas, over a I and it implied the kind of cadenzas that are associated with the ending of concerto movements. The word lunga (shortened form of the Italian lunga pausa, meaning \\"long pause\\") is sometimes added above a fermata to indicate a longer duration, the length of which is at the discretion of the performer rather than note values. right right Some modern composers (including Francis Poulenc, Krzysztof Penderecki, György Kurtág, and Luigi Nono) have expanded the symbol's usage to indicate approximate duration, incorporating fermatas of different sizes, square- and triangle-shaped fermatas, and so on to indicate holds of different lengths. However, that is not standard usage. In the music notation program Sibelius: \\"By default, a regular fermata is set to 1.5 times written duration, a long (square) fermata is set to 1.75 times written duration, and a short (triangular) fermata is set to 1.25 written duration.\\"Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). \\"Sibelius 5 Reference\\", p.284.

This chevron-shaped community is one of Chicago's 16 lakefront neighborhoods near the southern rim of Lake Michigan 10 miles south of downtown. A working-class neighborhood, it is bordered by East 79th Street on the north, South Chicago Avenue (the Chicago Skyway) on the southwest, a small stretch of East 95th Street on the south. With the Calumet River on the community's southeast side, South Chicago can be considered the literal gateway to the Calumet Region and the first among the four Chicago neighborhoods (East Side, Hegewisch and South Deering) that are considered by the locals as Chicago's Southeast Side. The Southeast Side is a description that, although true, the city itself continues to resist including this neighborhood with all of Chicago's South Side communities. ==History== Once a separate community, South Chicago began as a series of scattered Native American settlements before becoming a village. First occupied by a chief named Askhum, considered 'lord' of the vast Callimink (Calumet) Valley and leader of the Pottawatomie people. They and other Native peoples used South Chicago and the shallow Calumet River area as portages, for seasonal settlements, hunting and fishing thousands of years before White settlers arrived to the \\"New World\\". The post-Civil War era brought with it great industrial innovation. Developer James H. Bowen, the \\"Father of South Chicago,\\" and others in a massive land grab wrested the land from its former existence and founded \\"Ainsworth\\" among other communities. This community was formed out of wetland prairie to provide residence for the labor force of European immigrants coming to work at the industries developing along the Calumet River, most notably the North Chicago Rolling Mill Company, built at the mouth of the river in 1881. Only fractions of the original topography and habitat remain as is the case with most of urban Chicago. With the entire Chicago Lakefront built on miles of landfill and slag there still remains a small stretch of semi-secluded beachfront just north of the Southworks Site. This bit of lakefront, once a seasonal settlement for the Pottawatomie, was left alone due to an umovable and deeply embedded bedrock of granite, which defied the development techniques of the time. It is the only natural beach frontage left and virtually unknown on the entire Chicago coastline. This beachfront and the massive outcrop of the Southworks table slag to the south and the water treatment plant to the north is a perfect demonstration of the vigorous advancement of the steel industry and 20th-century development. The four communities of Ainsworth; the Bush, Millgate Cheltenham/South Chicago and Calumet quickly developed into one village referred to collectively as South Chicago during the wave of annexation in 1883. The predominantly woodframed architecture of the Bush, Millgate and eastern Cheltemham are a lesson in Victoriana with the 'sunken yards' and bridge-like walk ups from street like Houston, Baltimore and Brandon attesting to the degree infrastructure built up from the original topography of that time. It also demonstrates how South Chicago was not immediately affected by the housing ordinances restricting the use of lumber for home building after The Great Fire of 1871. Most of the neighborhood north of East 83rd Street and west of South Manistee Avenue was developed after WWII and contain mostly brick homes, but under the ordinance brick homes began being built throughout the newly annexed neighborhood after 1883. South Chicago was bustling with waves of immigrants as the popularity of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The steel mill became U.S. Steel South Works in 1901, continuing to attract immigrants from Ireland, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and Italy. During the 1950s many residents called the northeast section of South Chicago *\\"The Bush\\" and worked in the local massive steel mill, US Steel. Others worked in neighboring steel mills such as Youngstown Steel, Republic Steel, Bethlehem Steel, and LaSalle Steel. At its zenith, South Chicago helped make the Chicago metropolitan area the leading producer of steel products in the nation. The Willis Tower and the Hancock Building were built from South Chicago steel. The embers, (graphite) from the smokestacks would cause the cars and sidewalks to sparkle and created a golden glow throughout the night. Softball and bowling were popular pastimes. Large Polish weddings on Saturdays were also a common sight. Throughout the early 1910s, Mexicans from a variety of regions within Mexico began to settle in communities throughout Chicago including South Chicago. South Chicago became one of the first growing Mexican communities in Chicago. The community faced many challenges including many racist attacks by the more assimilated groups. The early Mexican community began to band together and worked to help build Our Lady of Guadalupe Church as they were not welcomed in other churches throughout the area. South Chicago's Mexican Patriotic Club's Mexican Independence Day (Sept. 16th) Parade was the first such parade in Chicago also celebrated with a carnival of rides and booths. ==Current life== While South Chicago has a sizable African American population, existing ethnic groups continue to have strong community ties in the area. Our Lady of Guadalupe is the oldest parish founded by Mexicans in the City of Chicago. Immaculate Conception, St. Michael's, two churches built in the 'Polish Cathedral style' and later Saint Bronislava have served South Chicago's Polish residents for over 80 years and now have significant sized Latino populations as well. The first Catholic parish established in South Chicago was St. Patrick, which was founded by Irish Catholics. Much of the business and shopping is done along Commercial Avenue. Several privately owned businesses such as clothing stores, furniture and retail, and beauty salons, can be found along Commercial Avenue. Restaurants from Nigerian to Italian cuisine are found in South Chicago. Despite the slow economy, more \\"Mom and Pop\\" stores flourish throughout South Chicago's residential areas, than in any other neighborhood. East 83rd Street, East 87th Street and south along Commercial Avenue to East 95th Street have attracted corporations, businesses and new banks into the community. Commercial Avenue is also home to many non-profit organizations including Healthy South Chicago, the Alianza Leadership Institute, Centro Comunitario Juan Diego, El Valor, Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, and SEDCOM. ==Parks and infrastructure== Wedged between East 89th Street, South Muskegon Avenue and the sycamore tree-lined South Chicago Avenue is the historic triangular Bessemer Park, named after English inventor Henry Bessemer, whose iron ore refining process revolutionized steel production. The park was designed by the Olmsted Brothers of the renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted of New York City's Central Park, as well as Chicago landmarks Washington Park and Jackson Park, built for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1891. Their work on the park started in early 1904 and finished late in 1905. The fieldhouse, only modestly upgraded, retains much of its original charm. The Bessemer Park Nature and Wildlife Garden is among Chicago's 23 noted natural \\"preserves\\" of native fauna and wildlife habitat. Bessemer Park and Russell Square Park on the corner of Bond Avenue and East 83rd Street (*the Bush), are among their last commissions, Bessemer Park is one of the largest parks on the South Side. Eckersall Playground Park and Stadium is centrally located in South Chicago at the corner of East 83rd Street and South Yates Avenue. Other new greenspaces are planned throughout the community including what is currently called \\"Park No. 503\\" at 8900 South Green Bay Avenue in the Millgate community. Designated bicycle paths from East 83rd Street, South Shore Drive/Mackinaw Avenue and South Chicago Avenue connect directly to the Burnham Greenway Trail which links to a comprehensive system of greenways throughout the Calumet Region. salt pile between South Harbor Avenue and the Calumet River Since the de- industrialization of South Chicago's once inaccessible shoreline from the late 1970s on, East 87th Street has been extended to Lake Michigan with the look and feel of a landscaped boulevard. The former Southworks site brownfield, an area larger than the Loop, is a cleared and remediated table of slag and concrete, currently being transformed into Chicago's newest lakefront park with the feel of wide open prairie land. The purchase of the property from notable world-class developers, has put South Chicago at the center of the city's, and the Nation's largest lakefront redevelopment effort in the 21st century. Mixed residential, retail and lake recreation are quietly planned. The new lakefront park, as yet nameless (which is nearing completion), was the missing link effectively closing the century-old gap between Chicago's world- class chain of parks between South Shore's Rainbow Beach Park in South Shore and Calumet Park in East Side neighborhoods, fulfilled the dreams of noted Chicago planner and architect, Daniel Burnham and business mogul and philanthropist Montgomery Ward, for a free and clear lakefront. Famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright had also once designed a comprehensive plan for the shoreline before it became hyper-industrialized. ==Transportation== South Chicago is not currently connected to the Chicago \\"L\\" rapid transit system. The nearest CTA Red Line station is located 3 miles west, at 95th Street & Dan Ryan Expressway. The CTA Green Line is 5 miles north, at 63rd Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. The South Chicago neighborhood does, however, contain 4 newly rebuilt Metra Electric Line, South Chicago Branch stations: Cheltenham and East 79th Street, East 83rd Street, 87th Street, and 93rd Street/South Chicago, which terminates in the heart of the neighborhood's business district along South Baltimore Avenue, and is the community's most accessible commuter rail service to downtown Chicago. Although Metra is mainly a suburban service, the outbound South Chicago Branch, which terminates within Chicago's city limits is the only Metra line to do so. The Chicago Skyway borders South Chicago Avenue, running northwest towards the Dan Ryan Expressway and southeast towards Hammond, Indiana. It can be entered nearby only towards Indiana, but has one westbound entrance, to the southeast at Indianapolis Boulevard & Avenue B. South Chicago is also served by a number of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes, services which enable commuters to make relatively easy connections to downtown and other Chicago neighborhoods. The buses that serve South Chicago are: * N5 South Shore Night Bus * 6 Jackson Park Express * J14 Jeffery Jump * 15 Jeffery Local * 26 South Shore Express * 30 South Chicago * 71 71st St./South Shore * 79 79th Street * N79 79th Street Owl * 87 87th Street * 95 95th Street ==Future== As part of an effort to stimulate sustainable and equitable economic development in the South Chicago neighborhood, the City of Chicago is sponsoring its redevelopment. The effort represents one of the largest sustainable neighborhood revitalization developments in the country and should serve as a guide to the city for sustainable redevelopment on the south side for the next 25 years. Chicago's plan is to be rated by the United States Green Building Council and is part of the Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Neighborhood Development pilot program. ===US Steel South Works Site redevelopment=== A thirty-year development plan estimated to cost $4 billion was approved by the city in September 2010, for the former site of the huge steel mill, which operated along the neighborhood's shoreline from 1880 to 1992. The site has undergone extensive demolition and environmental remediation since 1992. The plan called for extension of Lake Shore Drive, with site construction and was to begin in 2012. ==Politics== South Chicago is a stronghold for the Democratic Party.

They live in regions of the Magadan Oblast and Kamchatka Krai and northern parts of Sakha east of the Lena River. According to the 2002 census, there were 19,071 Evens in Russia. According to the 2010 census, there were 22,383 Evens in Russia. They speak their own language called Even language, one of the Tungusic languages. The Evens are close to the Evenks by their origins and culture. Officially, they were considered to be of Orthodox faith since the 19th century, but the Evens managed to preserve different forms of non-Christian beliefs, such as shamanism. Traditional Even life is centred upon nomadic pastoralism of domesticated reindeer, supplemented with hunting, fishing and animal-trapping. There were 104 Evens in Ukraine, 19 of whom spoke Even. (Ukr. Cen. 2001) ==History== The ancestors of the Evens were believed to have migrated from the Transbaikal area to the coastal areas of eastern Siberia. The economy was supplemented by winter hunts to obtain wild game. Hunters sometimes rode reindeer, sometimes moved along on wooden skis. In the 17th century, the people today known as the Eveni were divided into three main tribes: the Okhotsk reindeer Tungus (Lamut), the Tiugesir, Memel’ and Buiaksir clans as well as a sedentary group of Arman’ speakers. Today, they are all known as Eveni.B. O. Dolgikh and Chester S. Chard (trans.), “The Formation of the Modern Peoples of the Soviet North\\" Arctic Anthropology 9(1) (1972): 17-26 The traditional lodgings of the Evens were conical tents which were covered with animal skins. In the southern coastal areas, fish skins were used. Settled Evens used a type of earth and log dugout. Sheds were erected near the dwellings in order to house stocks of frozen fish and meat. The Soviet years marked significant changes for the Evens. The Soviets created a written language for them and got rid of illiteracy among the Evens in the 1930s. Many nomadic Evens chose to settle down, joined the kolkhozes and engaged themselves in cattle-breeding and agriculture. ==Notable Evens== *Varvara Belolyubskaya, linguist and poet *Viktor Lebedev, freestyle wrestler ==References== ==Further reading== *James Forsyth, \\"A History of the Peoples of Siberia\\",1992 * ==External links== * The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire: The Evens * Aboriginal Peoples of the Russian North: Links to On-Line Resources * Notes on the Evens and Evenks Category:Ethnic groups in Russia Category:Tungusic peoples Category:Indigenous peoples of North Asia Category:Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East Category:Indigenous peoples in the Arctic Category:Modern nomads * ","title":"Evens"},{"id":"1422353","text":"Crataegus mollis, known as downy hawthorn or red hawthorn, occurs in eastern North America from southeastern North Dakota east to Nova Scotia and southwest to eastern Texas. The range of this species is from southern Ontario and Michigan to eastern North Dakota and southward to Denison, Texas, and Arizona. This tree inhabits wooded bottomlands, the prairie border, and the midwest savanna understorey. This tree grows to 10–13 m high with a dense crown of thorny branches and an ash-grey trunk. The leaves are 5–10 cm in length and often drop in late summer due to defoliation by leaf diseases. The tree seems to suffer little from the early loss of its leaves. Among the earliest in the genus to bloom, downy hawthorn also has earliest ripening fruit, which decorate the defoliated tree in late summer and early fall. The large brightly colored edible fruit of the species ripen from the middle of August to early in September. It is closely related to Crataegus submollis, but the two species have separate native ranges. Amongst other differences between these two species, C. submollis has approximately 10 stamens, whereas C. mollis has approximately 20 stamens per flower.Phipps, J.B., O'Kennon, R.J., Lance, R.W. (2003). Hawthorns and medlars. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K. The white flowers are borne in clusters at the end of the branches in spring. The bright red edible fruit ripens in late summer and early fall and falls soon after. This species is a target of Gypsy moths. Leaf rusts and fireblight are among the many foliage diseases to affect this species. The sharp thorns are a hazard. This species is uncommon in cultivation. The seeds of the species usually do not germinate until two to three years after the fruit has ripened as they have a latent period. ==Images== Image:Crataegus-mollis- trunk.jpg Image:Crataegus-mollis-bud-break.jpg Image:Crataegus-mollis- fruit.jpg ==References== *Sternberg, G.

The 47th numbered area, it is located on the city's far south side. This area is also called \\"The Triangle\\" by locals, as it is bordered by railroad tracks on every side; the Illinois Central on the west, the Rock Island on the south and the Nickel Plate Railroad (now Norfolk-Southern) on the east. With a population of 2,254 in 2016, it is the least populous of the community areas, as well as the second smallest by area after Oakland. ==History== ===Etymology=== The Burnside station subsequently the community area is named for Ambrose Burnside, a general for the Union in the American Civil War and an official in the Illinois Central Railroad (ICRR). ===19th century=== The area was mostly undeveloped swamp land north of Lake Calumet until after the American Civil War. The ICRR built the Burnside Station at 95th street. By the 1890s, the ICRR began construction of a roundhouse and repair shop at 95th and South Park Boulevard on what is now the site of Chicago State University. Developer W. V. Jacobs purchased the land in the triangle and began building residential homes. The area was settled by predominantly Hungarian, Polish, Italian and Ukrainian immigrants. Factory jobs were plentiful at the nearby Burnside Shops as well as Pullman Company, Burnside Steel Mill and other nearby factories. ===20th century=== Originally considered part of Roseland and the Chatham communities, it was distinguished as one of the 77 Chicago community areas when the University of Chicago established its sociological map of Chicago communities. Following World War II, the area's population makeup included a growing number of African-Americans. This was one of several transformations that this working-class neighborhood would undergo. Burnside's fortunes began to change in the 1960s when industry patterns lead to economic decline. Nearby steel mills were shuttered. The Pullman Company scaled back production and eventually closed for good in 1981. Skyrocketing crime rates, gang violence and urban decay forced longtime residents and businesses to move away, a phenomenon referred to as white flight. ==Geography== Burnside is community area #47. It is located south of the Loop. It is geographically the smallest of the community areas. It is bounded by the ICRR to the west, the New York Central Railroad to the east, and the Rock Island Railroad to the south. ==Demographics== According to an analysis of United States Census data by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 2,254 people and 956 households in Burnside. The racial makeup of the area was 0.4% White, 97.5% African American, and 0.6% other races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 1.5% of the population. In the area, the population was spread out, with 16.9% under the age of 19, 21.8% from 20 to 34, 15.5% from 35 to 49, 19.4% from 50 to 64, and 26.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. 45.7% of residents lived alone, 28.8% of residents lived with one other person, 8.1% of residents lived in three-person households, and 17.4% of residents lived in a household of four or more people. == Politics == Burnside is a stronghold for the Democratic Party. Its small size and closed boundaries have historically rendered it unattractive to most politicians and resulted in it receiving few rewards. ===Local=== In the Chicago City Council Burnside is part of the 8th ward where it is represented by Democratic alderman Michelle A. Harris. Throughout the 20th century it historically alternated between the 9th and 10th wards. ===State=== In the Illinois House of Representatives Burnside is part of the District 33, where it is represented by Democrat Marcus C. Evans Jr. In the Illinois Senate it is part of District 17, where it is represented by Democrat Elgie Sims. ===Federal=== In the 2016 presidential election, Burnside cast 1,206 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 19 votes Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Burnside cast 1,427 votes for Barack Obama and 8 votes for Mitt Romney. ==References== ==External links== * Official City of Chicago Burnside Community Map * Community Map Category:Community areas of Chicago Category:South Side, Chicago ","title":"Burnside, Chicago"},{"id":"1422361","text":"The French as Seen by...

The park shares its southern border with Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which is part of the larger Superior National Forest. These large wilderness parks are often collectively referred to as the Boundary Waters or the Quetico- Superior Country. ==Geography== The park includes over 2000 unofficial, unimproved wilderness campsites spread throughout more than 600 lakes. Canoeists require permit reservations and in-season may enter the Quetico only via six Ranger Stations, which serve 21 specific entry points. Visitors may drive to three of these ranger stations: Dawson Trail, Atikokan, and Lac La Croix. Beaverhouse can be reached only by portage and paddle; visitors may paddle or take a tow from an outfitter to reach Cache Bay or Prairie Portage stations. Drive-in camping is available only at the Dawson Trail campground; log cabins are also available to rent. Most of the southern half of the Park is a region known historically as \\"Hunter Island\\" (not a real island). ==History== French River Rapids, field sketch by Paul Kane, 1845. Canoe pictograph, Agnes Lake The north country was inhabited by the Paleo-Indian culture circa 8000 BC. Limited artifacts have been found in the park from that era and the subsequent Archaic period circa 6000 years ago. Among these is rock art, such as a canoe pictograph at Agnes Lake. Artifacts from the Early Woodland Era (circa 1300 years ago) have not been found there, but pottery and clay pipes from the Later Woodland Indians have been found there.{{cite journalurl= title=Paddling Down BWCAW Historylast=Montheifirst=Heather journal=Boundary Waters Journal date= Spring 2020pages=48–57 In 1909, an \\"Order in Council\\" by the Government of Ontario established the Quetico Forest Reserve. Early the same year, the United States federal government established the adjacent Superior National Forest and Superior Game Refuge, part of which would eventually be designated and protected as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Quetico Provincial Park was created in 1913 through passage of the Provincial Parks Act. Road access was not constructed until 1954. Ontario's creation of the park created a conflict with the Lac La Croix First Nation, who had a reserve located within the park boundaries. In 1915, the province cancelled the band's right to Reserve 24C and relocated the people, also effectively cancelling their treaty rights from the reserve. The grievances of the band were not addressed until 1991, when the Minister of Natural Resources, Bud Wildman, made a landmark, formal apology in the legislature for these actions. Wildman also committed to government \\"immediate and long-term assistance to improve the economic and social conditions of the band.\\" He approved one of the band's requests: to allow them to use mechanized boats and canoes on three additional lakes in the park for the purposes of guiding, and to expand use of floatplanes, during an interim period while public review was conducted. The origin of the park's name is obscure. Locals say the park is named after the \\"Quebec Timber Company\\". The name may also be a version of the French words quête de la côte, which means \\"search for the coast\\". It may also be from an Ojibwe name for a benevolent spirit who resides in places of great beauty. The park has been completely protected from logging since 1971. Motor vehicles, including boats, were banned in the Quetico in 1979. An exception allows members of the Lac La Croix Guides Association, part of the Lac La Croix First Nation, to operate power boats with engines of no more than 10 horsepower (7.5 kW) on Quetico, Beaverhouse, Wolseley, Tanner, Minn, and McAree lakes. Following public review of an amended management plan in the late 1990s, and additional changes, in the early 21st century, the official plan (Agreement of Coexistence) is to phase out motorized guiding activities by the Lac La Croix First Nation in Quetico Provincial Park through simple attrition by the year 2015. ==Regulations== Falls near Pickerel Lake Quetico has restrictions as a wilderness park: Group size may not exceed 9 members. Containers of fuel, insect repellent, medicines, personal toilet articles, and other items that are not food or beverage are the only cans or bottles that may be brought into Quetico. It is an offence to possess non-burnable and non- reusable food or beverage containers. Mechanized devices such as power saws, generators, ice augers, or portage wheels are prohibited. It is illegal to damage live trees and other plants, and to remove any plants from the park. Fishing regulations were updated effective 1 January 2008. Fisherman are permitted to use only barbless hooks and artificial bait in the Park. \\"This means that no live or dead organic bait can be used in the park, including but not limited to leeches, worms, and salted minnows.\\"Ontario Parks, \\"Quetico Provincial Park Wilderness Guide 2009.\\" Barbed hooks may be carried in a tackle box but must not be used on the fishing line. Barbed hooks must be pinched before being attached to a fishing line. Park users are encouraged to use only lead-free tackle when fishing within the park. Hunting or molesting wildlife, or possession of a firearm or fireworks is not allowed. ==Geology and drainage== Agnes Lake Quetico is near the southern edge of the Canadian Shield, an exposed 1000-mile expanse of ancient Precambrian rock, some of which is among the oldest exposed rock in the world. The park contains numerous \\"young\\" lakes (only tens of thousands of years old) that are held by this ancient bedrock. Due to its proximity to the Laurentian Divide, the park can be considered to be in the headwaters of the Hudson Bay watershed. It and the adjacent Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the United States comprise the most popular canoeing area in the world. The southern part of the park is drained by the Basswood River, the central and eastern parts of the park by the Maligne River, and the northern part of the park by the Quetico River. All of these rivers flow into the Namakan River west of the park. It flows into the Rainy River, Winnipeg River, Nelson River and finally into Hudson Bay. == Wildlife == Common Loon Quetico Provincial Park is home to many different species of animals. Because of Quetico's strict regulations for keeping the habitat of these animals unchanged, there are a wide variety of animals that will be seen during a visit to Quetico. A majority of the animals include small mammals. These small mammals include, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoon's, groundhogs, rabbits, minks, gophers, weasels, and porcupines. Other small animals that live in Quetico are otters, muskrats, beavers, and fishers. Besides small mammals, the wildlife in Quetico makes a perfect home for larger mammals. While visiting, one may see moose, wolves, coyotes, lynxes, bobcats, cougars, white-tailed deer, foxes, and black bears. Due to the risk of bear attacks, it is important to see how to handle bear encounters. There are also a wide variety of birds living in the park. Some of the common birds seen in Quetico include common loons, bald eagles, herring gulls, Canada geese and red-tailed hawks. Quetico is known for its excellent fishing. The four most popular fish in Quetico's water are smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye and lake trout. Bunchberry plant Some of the more common native plants to Quetico include the following. White pine is a common tree in the area, these trees are home to bald eagles and other large birds. Another tree that can be found is the red pine. Red pines are different from white pines in that the red pine has long clusters of two needles with red bark. The white pine has five soft thin needles. Other trees include cedar, birch, trembling aspen, red osier dogwood and many others. Because of all the wet marsh areas, there are many wetlands in Quetico. Labrador Tea is a shrub that can be found in some of these wetlands. Labrador Tea has a leathery texture with a soft green color. This plant was commonly used by Native Americans and Voyageurs for tobacco and tea. Bunchberry plants have four or six leaves. The plant has white flowers in the spring and red berries in the summer. Although there are many plants in the park with berries, it is important to learn which berries are edible before eating them. ==Gallery== File:A Great View on Beaverhouse.JPGView from a campsite on Beaverhouse Lake File:Sunset on Beaverhouse.JPGSunset on Beaverhouse Lake File:Beach on Beaverhouse.JPGHidden beach on Beaverhouse Lake File:Thunderstorm on Kawnipi.JPGSevere summer storm crashing over Kawnipi Lake File:Double Rainbow on Kawnipi.JPGDouble rainbow after the storm on Kawnipi Lake File:Early Morning Fog on Keats.JPGSome early morning fog on Keats Lake File:Rainstorm over Keats.JPGRainstorm skirts over Keats Lake File:A Beautiful Day on Keats.JPGSummer day on Keats Lake File:Snake Falls on Keats.JPGSnake Falls, on the east side of Keats Lake ==Northern Tier High Adventure== The park is used by the Boy Scouts of America as part of the Northern Tier High Adventure. ==See also== *Boundary Waters *Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness *La Verendrye Provincial Park *Lake Saganaga *Voyageurs National Park *Voyageurs ==References== ==External links== * *The Quetico Foundation *Friends of Quetico Park *Quetico Superior Foundation Category:Provincial parks in Ontario Category:Protected areas of Rainy River District Category:Protected areas established in 1909 Category:1909 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Quetico Provincial Park"},{"id":"1422384","text":"Calumet Heights, located on the South Side of the city, is one of the 77 well defined community areas of Chicago, Illinois.

He is best known for Between Pacific Tides (1939), a pioneering study of intertidal ecology, and for his influence on writer John Steinbeck, which resulted in their collaboration and coauthorship of the Sea of Cortez (1941), later republished as The Log from the Sea of Cortez (1951). ==Life== Ricketts was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Abbott Ricketts and Alice Beverly Flanders Ricketts. He had a younger sister, Frances, and a younger brother, Thayer. His sister, Frances (Ricketts) Strong, said of him that he had a mind like a dictionary and was often in trouble for correcting teachers and other adults. Ricketts spent most of his childhood in Chicago, except for a year in South Dakota when he was ten years old. After a year of college, Ricketts traveled to Texas and New Mexico. In 1917 he was drafted into the Army Medical Corps. He hated the military bureaucracy but, according to John Steinbeck, \\"was a successful soldier.\\" After discharge from the army, Ricketts studied zoology at the University of Chicago. He was influenced by his professor, W. C. Allee, but dropped out without taking a degree. He then spent several months walking through the American south, from Indiana to Florida. He used material from this trip to publish an article in Travel magazine titled \\"Vagabonding Through Dixie.\\" He returned to Chicago and studied some more at the university. In 1922 Ricketts met and married Anna Barbara Maker, whom he called \\"Nan.\\" A year later they had a son, Edward F. Ricketts, Jr., and moved to California to set up Pacific Biological Laboratories with Albert E. Galigher: Galigher was Ricketts' college friend with whom he had run a similar business on a smaller scale. In 1924 Ricketts became sole owner of the lab, and soon two daughters were born: Nancy Jane on 28 November 1924, and Cornelia on 6 April 1928. Between 1925 and 1927, Ricketts' sister Frances and both his parents moved to California; Frances and their father Abbott worked with Ricketts at the lab. In late 1930 Ricketts met aspiring writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol, who had moved to Pacific Grove earlier in the year. For more than a year Carol worked half-time for Ricketts at the lab, until 1932 when Ricketts' wife Nan left, taking their two daughters, and Ricketts no longer had enough money to pay Carol's salary. Steinbeck himself also spent time at the lab, learning marine biology, helping Ricketts preserve specimens and talking about philosophy. Steinbeck lived very near the lab. What kept them together was the discovery that each had an almost boundless curiosity about almost everything, and that their personality meshed so well. Steinbeck had a need to give, and Ricketts a need to receive. Ricketts made listening an art. At one point in Steinbeck's life, he suffered an \\"overwhelming emotional upset\\", and went to the lab to stay with Ricketts. Ricketts played music for Steinbeck until he could bear to come back to himself.Benson 1990 Nan's separation from Ricketts in 1932 was the first of many separations. In 1936 Ricketts and Nan separated for good, and he took up residence in his lab. On 25 November 1936, a fire spread from the adjacent cannery, destroying the lab. Ricketts lost nearly everything, including an extraordinary amount of correspondence, research notes, manuscripts, and his prized library, which had held everything from invaluable scientific resources to his beloved collection of poetry. However, the manuscript of Ricketts' textbook (with Jack Calvin) Between Pacific Tides had already been sent to the publisher. John Steinbeck would become a silent 50% partner in the lab, after funding its reconstruction costs. Steinbeck, late in life In 1940 Ricketts and Steinbeck journeyed to the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California) in a chartered fishing boat to collect invertebrates for the scientific catalog in their book, Sea of Cortez. Also in 1940, Ricketts began a relationship with Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony \\"Toni\\" Solomons Jackson, who became his common-law wife. As Steinbeck's secretary, Jackson helped edit The Log From the Sea of Cortez. Jackson, who had attended the University of California, Los Angeles, was the daughter of Katherine Gray Church and Theodore Solomons, an explorer and early member of the Sierra Club, who had discovered and defined the John Muir Trail. Jackson and her young daughter Katherine Adele moved in with Ricketts and lived with him until 1947. In addition to Steinbeck, their circle of friends included the novelist and painter Henry Miller and the mythologist, writer, and lecturer Joseph Campbell.Mavericks on Cannery Row American Scientist, Book review. During World War II, Ricketts again served in the Army, this time as a medical lab technician; he was drafted in October 1942, missing the age cut-off by days. During his service, he kept collecting marine life and compiling data. His son was drafted in 1943. In 1945, Steinbeck's novel Cannery Row was published. Ricketts, the model for \\"Doc,\\" became a celebrity, and tourists and journalists began seeking him out. Steinbeck portrayed \\"Doc\\" (and thus, Ricketts) as a many-faceted intellectual who was somewhat outcast from intellectual circles, a party-loving drinking man, in close touch with the working class and with the prostitutes and bums of Monterey's Cannery Row. Steinbeck wrote of \\"Doc\\": \\"He wears a beard and his face is half Christ and half satyr and his face tells the truth.\\"See Tamm 2004, p. 292; Burkhead 2002, p. 91; Steinbeck 1994 [1945], Chapter V, p. 29 Ricketts himself read Cannery Row with exasperation, by all accounts, but ended saying simply that it could not be criticized because it had not been written with malice.Tamm, Eric Enno. Beyond the Outer Shores: The Untold Odyssey of Ed Ricketts, the Pioneering Ecologist Who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell. Four Walls Eight Windows, 2004. Ricketts was also portrayed as \\"Doc\\" in Sweet Thursday, the sequel to Cannery Row; as \\"Friend Ed\\" in Burning Bright; as \\"Doc Burton\\" in In Dubious Battle; as Jim Casy in The Grapes of Wrath; and as \\"Doctor Winter\\" in The Moon is Down. In September 1946, Ricketts' daughter Nancy Jane had a son, making Ricketts a grandfather. That same year, his stepdaughter Kay's health deteriorated due to a brain tumor; she died the following year, on 5 October 1947. Kay's mother, Toni left Ricketts shortly afterwards. Just a few weeks later, Ricketts met Alice Campbell, a music and philosophy student half his age. They \\"married\\" in early 1948, though the marriage was not valid because Ricketts had never legally divorced Nan. In March 1948 in New York City, Toni Jackson married Dr Benjamin Elazari Volcani, a renowned microbiologist she had met while he was working with the famous microbiologist C. B. van Niel (a student of Albert Kluyver's) at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey in 1943. In 1948, Ricketts and Steinbeck planned together to go to British Columbia and write another book, The Outer Shores, on the marine life north towards Alaska. On previous trips Ricketts had already done most of the needed research and he gave Steinbeck the typescripts for these as he had done previously with The Sea of Cortez.Bruce Robison, \\"Mavericks on Cannery Row,\\" American Scientist, vol. 92, no. 6 (November–December 2004, p. 1: a review of Eric Enno Tamm, Beyond the Outer Shores: The Untold Odyssey of Ed Ricketts, the Pioneering Ecologist who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell, Four Walls Eight Windows, 2004. A week before the planned expedition, on 8 May 1948, as Ricketts was driving across the railroad tracks at Drake Avenue, just uphill from Cannery Row, on his way to dinner after his day's work, a Del Monte Express (passenger train) hit his car.Bruce Robison, \\"Mavericks on Cannery Row,\\" American Scientist, vol. 92, no. 6 (November–December 2004, p. 1.Marquis Childs, \\"A Novel Aquarium Depicts the Story of Monterey Bay,\\" Smithsonian, vol. 16, no. 6 (June 1985), p. 95. He lived for three days, conscious at least some of the time, before dying on May 11. A life-size bust of Ricketts, at the site of the long-defunct rail crossing, commemorates the biologist-philosopher who inspired novelist John Steinbeck and mythologist Joseph Campbell. Passers-by often pick nearby flowers and place them in the statue's hand. Also at the crossing are derelict crossbucks marking the site of the accident. ==Lab== 800 Cannery Row In 1923, Ed Ricketts and his business partner Albert Galigher started Pacific Biological Laboratories (PBL), a marine biology supply house. The lab was located in Pacific Grove at 165 Fountain Avenue. The business was later moved to 740 Ocean View Avenue, Monterey, California, with Ricketts as sole owner. Today, that location is 800 Cannery Row. On 25 November 1936, a fire broke out at the Del Mar Cannery next to the lab. Most of the laboratory's contents were destroyed. The typescript of Between Pacific Tides survived, as it had already been sent to Stanford University for publication. With an investment from John Steinbeck, who became silent partner and 50% owner of the business as a result, Ricketts rebuilt the lab using the original floorplan. Ricketts' lab on Cannery Row had attracted visitors who ran the gamut from writers, artists and musicians to prostitutes and bums. Gatherings often included discussions of philosophy, science and art, and sometimes developed into parties that continued for days. Participants in meetings had included Steinbeck, Bruce Ariss, Joseph Campbell (who had worked at the lab as Ricketts' assistant), Adelle Davis, Campbell Chronology Accessed March 30, 2009 Henry Miller, Lincoln Steffens and Francis Whitaker. Amidst the tumult of commercial activity and tourist attractions that Cannery Row has become in recent decades, the modest and mostly unnoticed and unmarked lab stands as a silent witness to the bygone era celebrated in Steinbeck's work. Ricketts' laboratory business was fictionalized in Steinbeck's Cannery Row as \\"Western Biological Laboratories.\\" Steinbeck was inspired to write The Pearl after visiting La Paz, Baja California Sur, with Ricketts on their Sea of Cortez expedition. ==Philosophy== In addition to his writings on marine life, Ricketts wrote three philosophical essays; he continued to revise them over the years, integrating new ideas in response to feedback from Campbell, Miller, and other friends. The first essay lays out his idea of \\"nonteleological thinking\\" - a way of viewing things as they are, rather than seeking explanations for them. In his second essay, \\"The Spiritual Morphology of Poetry,\\" he proposed four progressive classes of poetry, from naive to transcendent, and assigned famous poets from Keats to Whitman to these categories. The third essay, \\"The Philosophy of 'Breaking Through',\\" explores transcendence throughout the arts and describes his own moments of 'breaking through', such as his first hearing of Madame Butterfly.Bayuk, Kevin (2002) An Analysis of the Concept of Breaking Through Cannery Row Foundation. According to his letters, conversations with composer John Cage helped Ricketts clarify some of his thoughts on poetry, and gave him new insight into the emphasis on form over content embraced by many modern artists. Even though Steinbeck presented the essays to various publishers on behalf of Ricketts, only one was ever published in his lifetime: the first essay appears (without attribution) in a chapter titled \\"Non-Teleological Thinking\\" in The Log From the Sea of Cortez. All of his major essays, along with other shorter works were published in The Outer Shores, vols. 1 and 2, edited by Joel Hedgpeth, and with additional biographical commentary also by Hedgpeth. Much of this material appears in Katharine Rodger's book, Breaking Through: Essays, Journals, and Travelogues of Edward F. Ricketts (2006). Joseph Campbell worked for a while as Ricketts' assistant In the 1930s and 1940s, Ricketts strongly influenced many of Steinbeck's writings. The biologist inspired a number of notable characters in Steinbeck's novels, and ecological themes recur in them. Ricketts' biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for East of Eden (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts' death in 1948. Ricketts also influenced the mythologist Joseph Campbell. This was an important period in the development of Campbell's thinking about the epic journey of \\"the hero with a thousand faces.\\" Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska, on the Grampus. Like Steinbeck, Campbell played with a novel written round Ricketts as hero, but unlike Steinbeck, didn't complete the book.Tamm, Eric Enno (2005) Of myths and men in Monterey: \\"Ed Heads\\" see Doc Ricketts as a cult figure Bruce Robison writes that \\"Campbell would refer to those days as a time when everything in his life was taking shape.... Campbell, the great chronicler of the \\"hero's journey\\" in mythology, recognized patterns that paralleled his own thinking in one of Ricketts's unpublished philosophical essays. Echoes of Carl Jung, Robinson Jeffers and James Joyce can be found in the work of Steinbeck and Ricketts as well as Campbell.\\" Henry Miller wrote about Ricketts in his book The Air-Conditioned Nightmare: [Ed Ricketts is] \\"a most exceptional individual in character and temperament, a man radiating peace, joy and wisdom\\" and said that Ricketts was (apart from L. C. Powell) the only person whom Miller, during his journey across USA, found being \\"satisfied with his lot, adjusted to his environment, happy in his work, and representative of all that is best in the American tradition.\\" Henry Miller, The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, New Directions, 1945, pp. 18 - 19 ==Ecology== In Ricketts' day, ecology was early in its development. Now-common concepts such as habitat, niche, succession, predator- prey relationships, and food chains were not yet mature ideas. Ricketts was among a few marine biologists who studied intertidal organisms in an ecological context. His first major scientific work — now regarded as a classic in marine ecology, and in its fifth edition — was Between Pacific Tides, published in 1939, co-authored with Jack Calvin. The third and fourth editions were revised by Joel Hedgpeth, a contemporary of Ricketts and Steinbeck; Hedgpeth continued the book's taxonomic excellence, while retaining its ecological approach. The pioneering nature of Ricketts' book may be appreciated by comparison with another classic work, now in its fourth edition, that was published two years later, in 1941: Light's Manual, by S. F. Light, of the University of California, Berkeley. Light's Manual is technical, difficult for laymen, but essential for specialists. On the other hand, Ricketts' Between Pacific Tides is readable, full of observations and side comments, and readily accessible to anyone with a genuine interest in seashore life. It cannot serve as a thorough manual to marine invertebrates, but it addresses the common and conspicuous animals in a style that invites and educates newcomers and offers substantial information for experienced biologists. It is not organized according to taxonomic classification, but instead by habitat. Thus, crabs are not all treated in the same chapter; crabs of the rocky shore, high in the intertidal, are in a separate section from crabs of lower intertidal zones or sandy beaches. Some concepts that Ricketts used in Between Pacific Tides were novel then and ignored by some in academia. Ricketts, writes Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, \\"was 'a lone, largely marginalized scientist' with no university degrees, and he had to struggle... against... traditionalists\\" to get the book published by Stanford University Press. Ricketts' subsequent book, Sea of Cortez, is almost two separate books. The first section is a narrative, co- written by Steinbeck and Ricketts (Ricketts kept a daily journal during the expedition; Steinbeck edited the journal into the narrative section of the book). Later, the narrative was published alone as The Log From the Sea of Cortez, without Ricketts's name. The remainder of the book, about 300 pages, is an \\"Annotated Phyletic Catalog\\" of specimens collected. This section was Ricketts' work alone. It was presented in the traditional taxonomic arrangement, but with numerous notes on ecological observations. Ricketts pursued pathfinding studies in quantitative ecology, analyzing the Monterey sardine fishery. In a 1947 article in the Monterey Peninsula Herald, he documented sardine harvests, described sardine ecology, and noted that harvests were declining as fishing intensity increased. When the sardines became depleted and the industry was destroyed, Ricketts explained what had happened to the sardines: \\"They're in cans.\\"Early years and family info, pp. xv-xxii; daughters, pp. 111 and 199; WWII draft, p. 177; Separation from Nan, fire, p. xxxi; Toni and Kay, Alice, death, pp. xliv-lii; Nancy Jane's son, p. 237; Essay info, pp xxxii-xxxvii; John Cage reference, pp. 81-84 and p. 194. Ricketts, Edward Flanders. Rodger, Katharine A. (2003). Renaissance Man of Cannery Row: The Life and Letters of Edward F. Ricketts. University of Alabama Press. The research Ricketts did on sardines was a seminal application of ecology to fisheries science, but it was not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably due to the fact that his stuff isn’t widely available... This is strange, but fisheries scientists so far as they are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts”.Ed Ricketts’ death, 50 years ago last week, preceded that of Cannery Row by only a few months. – Eric Enno Tamm (2005) Monterey County Weekly.

It includes the neighborhoods of Fernwood, Princeton Park, Lilydale, the southern portion of West Chesterfield, Rosemoor, Sheldon Heights and West Roseland. ==History== Dutch immigrant population Roseland was settled in the 1840s by Dutch immigrants, who called the area \\"de Hooge Prairie\\", the High Prairie, because it was built on higher, drier ground than the earlier Dutch settlement several miles further south of the Little Calumet River, which was called \\"de Laage Prairie\\", the Low Prairie, now South Holland, Illinois. The community was entirely agrarian until the late 19th century, when the town of Pullman, Chicago was built between Roseland and Lake Calumet. George M. Pullman planned a model industrial city built around a factory that manufactured his \\"Palace\\" railway coaches. Modern brick homes were built with electricity, plumbing and gas utilities. Skilled tradesmen from all over Europe immigrated to the town of Pullman with many settling in nearby Roseland. The Pullman Freight Car Works was built in the 1900s decade on 103rd Street, and survives to this day as a distribution center for flat-rolled steel. Roseland was annexed into Chicago in 1892. The Roseland area became a very cosmopolitan community made up of multi cultural, ethnic and racial backgrounds. There was a large population of Italian Americans just east of Roseland in the Kensington community. While some Italians of southern Italian origins came to the area from the Little Italy neighborhood on Taylor Street, many other Italians who settled in the area came from the northern Italian regions of Piedmont, Tuscany, and the Veneto. All these Italians from varied regions of Italy helped to make the Kensington area, and the wider Roseland area, centers of South Side Italian life. Sant' Antonio di Padua (St. Anthony's) Church (built 1903) and its grammar school were key religious and cultural landmarks of the area. Supporting businesses flourished rapidly changing the farmland into commercial and residential communities surrounded by a number of industries. Stores on Michigan Avenue served the entire south side of Chicago. Fortunes began to change in the 1960s when industry patterns lead to economic decline. Steel mills to the east were shuttered. Pullman scaled back production and eventually closed for good in 1981. The huge Sherwin-Williams paint factory closed for good in 1995. A period of rapid ethnic succession took place. The much lauded mural \\"I Welcome Myself to a New Place: Roseland Pullman Mural,\\" by Olivia Gude, Jon Pounds, and Marcus Jefferson, 1988, was designed to unite the predominantly African American community of Roseland with its nearest neighbor, the predominantly white Pullman community. == Neighborhoods == === Fernwood === Fernwood lies on the western edge of Roseland, between 99th and 103rd Streets. It was considered an \\"upscale\\" neighborhood of Roseland and extended west into the Washington Heights community up to Halsted Street. Sometimes referred to as West Roseland, it was incorporated in 1883. The area was known for a gardenlike parkway between 95th and 103rd Streets along Eggelston that was known as Fernwood Parkway. The area is noted for one of the worst race riots in Chicago history. In mid August 1947, several black veterans and their families moved into the CHA Fernwood Park Housing Project at 104th and Halsted. Area residents viewed this as one of several attempts by the CHA to initiate racial integration into white communities.Arnold R. Hirsch, (1998) \\"Making the Second Ghetto: Race and Housing in Chicago 1940–1960\\" page 54. The University of Chicago Press A violent mob action resulted which lasted for three days and mobilized over 1,000 law enforcement officers to control.Chicago Tribune, August 17, 1947 page 10 \\"1,000 Policemen keep order at Homes Project\\" During the 1950s and 1960s the community witnessed the combined effects of blockbusting by unscrupulous real estate agents and the ensuing white flight resulting in complete ethnic transition. Like the surrounding communities of Roseland and Washington Heights, Fernwood Park remains predominantly African-American. ===Lilydale=== Lilydale is a small enclave of modest homes in the northwest corner of Roseland. In the 1920s and 1930s the thinly populated area was referred to as little more than a \\"cabbage patch\\". It consisted of mostly vacant land between 91st and 95th Streets and between State Street and the Chicago & Eastern Illinois Railroad tracks (then, the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad). The 1940s saw a peak in the Second Migration of Black workers from the South seeking jobs and a better life in the industrialized North. Affordable housing for Blacks was limited and generally restricted to the \\"Black Belt\\" on the south side of Chicago. Housing shortages grew more severe with the onset of World War II as defense workers moved into the city to aid the war effort. Lilydale became an attractive area due to its proximity to the steel mills and other defense industries on the south side. It was centrally located and convenient to railroads and streetcars. Beginning in 1942, Black contractors Matthew Goodwin and \\"Duke\\" Hodges began building simple, low cost single family homes and duplexes for a growing working-class black neighborhood.Albert G. Barnett, \\"Chicago Negroes Fight Housing Shortage, Build Their Own Homes,\\" Chicago Defender, June 7, 1947, pg. 13 To Black trades workers, Lilydale represented an all-too-rare opportunity to use their skills and help resolve their own housing problem. While the homes were modest, they were made of brick and many still stand today. They were originally intended to be rented to defense workers and sold to veterans after the War. The homes were dramatically more affordable than similar homes in the area making them attractive to workers and veterans alike. Today, only about 12 city blocks remain of the original settlement and the area is generally referred to as a part of Princeton Park. === Princeton Park === Princeton Park is a community of single-family homes built in 1944 and is located in the northwest corner of the Roseland community area in Chicago. Originally, it was a subdivision of low cost multi-family row houses between 91st and 95th streets and Wentworth and Harvard streets. The eastern boundary later extended to State Street (now the Dan Ryan Expressway). This area includes single-family homes, classic bungalows, that were part of the Lilydale community. Donald O'Toole The project was the creation of banker/real estate developer Donald O'Toole.Encyclopedia of Chicago \\"Roseland\\" http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1094.html The land had previously been used for farming by the primarily Dutch settlers in the Roseland area. In the early 1900s, Roseland transitioned from a farming community to an urban residential neighborhood. As one of the last remaining open spaces it was primed for development. The low cost housing was marketed exclusively to the African-American community making it the first established black community in Roseland. It remains a segregated African-American community today. Once established, Princeton Park was on the leading edge of the ensuing \\"panic peddling\\" that engulfed Roseland. Unscrupulous realtors used scare tactics such as blockbusting to frighten and intimidate white residents; churning the real estate market for quick profits. As suburban housing and commuting became more accessible in the 1960s and 1970s, middle class whites left the Roseland area resulting in a total ethnic transformation. ==Politics== Roseland is a stronghold for the Democratic Party. In the 2016 presidential election, Roseland cast 20,042 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 316 votes for Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Roseland cast 24,400 votes for Barack Obama and cast 132 votes for Mitt Romney. == Transportation == Train service in the community area is provided by Metra. The Metra Electric District's Main Line runs along the Roseland community area's border with the Pullman community area with stations at 95th Street, 103rd Street, 107th Street, 111th Street, and 115th Street. The 95th/Dan Ryan station, a terminal station of the Chicago \\"L\\" Red Line, is located in Roseland. Red Ahead, a program to extend the Red Line south to 130th Street, would result in new stations in Roseland at 103rd Street, 111th Street, 115th Street. In 2018, it was estimated that this project would commence construction in 2022 and the service would be ready in 2026. ==Education== The Kids off the Block memorial featuring hundreds of stones, one for each person killed by gun violence in Roseland Chicago Public Schools operates public schools in Roseland. K-8 schools in Roseland and serving sections of Roseland include Bennett, Cullen, Curtis, Scanlon, Dunne, Frank L. Gillespie, Alex Haley Academy, L. Hughes, Kohn, and Lavizzo. K-8 Schools outside of Roseland and serving sections of Roseland include Evers, Fernwood, Pullman, Ryder, and Smith.\\"Far South Elementary Schools .\\" Chicago Public Schools.

Strong was the first artist to record a hit for Motown, although he is best known for his work as a songwriter, particularly in association with producer Norman Whitfield. Among his most famous work at Motown, Strong wrote the lyrics for many of the songs recorded by the Temptations. He was born in West Point, Mississippi. ==Career== Strong was among the first artists signed to Berry Gordy's fledgling label, Tamla Records, and was the performer on the company's first hit, \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", which reached No. 2 US R&B; in 1960. The single was originally released on Tamla, Motown's first label, but was then leased to the Anna label as it was getting airplay, and it was on the Anna label that it was a hit. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. \\"Money\\" was later recorded by a number of acts, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kingsmen, Richard Wylie and His Band, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Searchers, the Flying Lizards, the Sonics and Buddy Guy. Strong claims that he co-wrote \\"Money\\" with Gordy and Janie Bradford; his name appears on the song's original copyright registration with the United States Copyright Office. Gordy disputed these claims, stating that Strong's name was only included because of a clerical error. In the mid 1960s, Strong became a Motown writer lyricist, teaming with producer Norman Whitfield. Together, they wrote some of the most successful and critically acclaimed soul songs ever to be released by Motown, including \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" by both Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight & the Pips; \\"War\\" by Edwin Starr; \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\\" by Paul Young; \\"Smiling Faces Sometimes\\" by the Undisputed Truth; and the long line of \\"psychedelic soul\\" records by the Temptations, including \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"I Can't Get Next to You\\", \\"Psychedelic Shack\\", \\"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\\", and \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\", amongst others. Strong received a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Song in 1973 for \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\". Strong and Whitfield also co-wrote the ballad \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)\\", a 1971 Billboard No. 1 that also marked the last Temptations single to feature original members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. After Motown moved its operations base from Detroit, Michigan, to Los Angeles, California, Strong left the label and resumed his singing career. He signed with Epic in 1972. Strong left the label for Capitol Records, where he recorded two albums in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Strong recorded \\"Rock It Easy\\" on an independent label, and wrote \\"You Can Depend on Me\\", which appeared on their The Second Time album (1988). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004. Strong has re-released his latest album, Stronghold II, which he wrote and composed in collaboration with rocker/songwriter Eliza Neals in 2008, in digital format only. In 2010, Strong appeared in \\"Misery\\", his first music video in his fifty years of recording music, co-produced by Eliza Neals and Martin \\"Tino\\" Gross with Strong at the helm. ==See also== *List of 1960s one-hit wonders in the United States ==Discography== ===Albums=== * 1975: Stronghold (No. 47 – Billboard Black Albums chart) * 1976: Live & Love * 1987: Love Is You * 2008: Stronghold II ===Singles=== * 1959: \\"Let's Rock\\" / \\"Do the Very Best You Can\\" – Tamla 54022 * 1959: \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" / \\"Oh I Apologize\\" (No. 23 Pop / No. 2 R&B;) – Tamla 54027 (re-released as Anna 1111) * 1960: \\"Yes, No, Maybe So\\" / \\"You Knows What To Do\\" – Tamla 54029 (re-released as Anna 1116) * 1960: \\"Whirlwind\\" (with The Rayber Voices)\\" / \\"I'm Gonna Cry (If You Quit Me)\\" – Tamla 54033 * 1961: \\"Money and Me\\" / \\"You Got What It Takes\\" - Tamla 54035 * 1961: \\"Misery\\" / \\"Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right\\" - Tamla 54043 * 1962: \\"Seven Sins\\" / \\"What Went Wrong\\" – ATCO 6225 * 1964: \\"Make Up Your Mind\\" / \\"I Better Run\\" – Tollie 9023 * 1972: \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\" – The Temptations, (US #1, UK #8) originally recorded by the Undisputed Truth * 1973: \\"Stand Up and Cheer for the Preacher\\" / (instrumental version) – Epic 5-11011 * 1975: \\"Surrender\\" / \\"There's Something About You\\" – Capitol 4120 * 1975: \\"Is It True\\" / \\"Anywhere\\" – Capitol 4052 * 1976: \\"Man Up In the Sky\\" / \\"Gonna Make It Right\\" - Capitol 4223 * 1980: \\"Love Is You\\" / \\"You Make Me Feel the Way You Do\\" - Coup CP-2007 * 1981: \\"Rock It Easy\\" / \\"Love Will Make It Alright\\" - Phase II WS8 02048 ==ReferencesCategory:American soul musicians Category:1941 births Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Living people Category:Motown artists Category:People from West Point, Mississippi Category:Singers from Mississippi Category:African-American singers Category:Singers from Detroit ","title":"Barrett Strong"},{"id":"1422435","text":"Robert René de Cotret, (February 20, 1944 - July 9, 1999) was a Canadian politician. Robert de Cotret was the President and CEO of The Conference Board of Canada from 1976-78 before being elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1978 by-election. He was elected as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa Centre, and was one of the few francophone MPs in the Tory caucus. Despite the Tory victory in the 1979 general election, Robert de Cotret lost his seat. In need of French-Canadian Cabinet ministers, Prime Minister Joe Clark appointed de Cotret to the Senate of Canada and to Cabinet as Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce in Clark's minority government. When the government was defeated in a motion of non-confidence, a new election was called for February 18, 1980. Cotret resigned his Senate seat in order to run for a seat in the House of Commons in the riding of Berthier—Maskinongé, but was defeated in the 1980 election along with the Clark government. He ran again in the 1984 election, and was elected along with a Progressive Conservative majority government led by Brian Mulroney. Mulroney appointed Cotret to Cabinet as President of the Treasury Board. In 1987, Cotret became Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, and reassumed the Treasury Board portfolio in 1989. In 1990, he became Minister of the Environment and then Secretary of State for Canada in 1991.

Originally from Etobicoke, Ontario, he was a founding member of the rock band Rheostatics, and currently performs with Bidiniband. In addition, he has published several books about music, travel and sports, and has written feature journalism pieces and columns for numerous Canadian magazines and newspapers. He is the only Canadian to have been nominated for all three of Canada's main entertainment awards, the Gemini Award for television work, the Genie Awards for film work and the Juno Awards for music, as well as being nominated on Canada's national book awards program, Canada Reads. ==Rheostatics (1979–2007)== With bass player / singer Tim Vesely, keyboardist Dave Crosby, and drummer Rod Westlake, Bidini formed the Rheostatics in 1979. After their first studio session and early shows (the band debuted in February 1980 at The Edge), Westlake left the band, and Bidini recruited drummer Dave Clark, which cemented the band's formative lineup. They released their first independent single, \\"Satellite Dancing/My Generation,\\" and played their first few Toronto shows in 1980, notably opening for Popular Spies at Toronto's legendary Edge Club. When Crosby left the band after 1981, they enlisted a horn section (\\"Trans Canada Soul Patrol\\"), released a few independent cassettes, and in 1985, began playing with guitarist / singer / songwriter Martin Tielli. Two of the band's eleven albums, 1990's Melville and 1992's Whale Music have been listed among top Canadian records of all time, both in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Albums and in three reader polls conducted by the music magazine Chart. In 1995, they recorded Music Inspired by the Group of Seven, a commissioned work from the National Gallery of Canada, and later made The Story of Harmelodia, a concept album considered one of the finest children's recordings of its time. Their biggest chart hit was 1994's \\"Claire,\\" which they recorded as part of the soundtrack to the film Whale Music, and two years later, the band opened a cross-Canada tour for The Tragically Hip, which became the basis for Bidini's book On a Cold Road. After 27 years, the Rheostatics broke up in 2007. Their final show was in March 2007 at Toronto's Massey Hall. Bidini's wife, Janet Morassutti—guitar player in Toronto noir-folk quintet The Billie Hollies—has received songwriting credit on the band's songs \\"Dope Fiends and Boozehounds\\", \\"Delta 88\\" and \\"Northern Wish\\", and was the narrator on the band's 1999 children's album The Story of Harmelodia. ==Bidiniband (2007–present)== After the demise of Rheostatics, Bidini formed Bidiniband, featuring former Rheostatics member Don Kerr on drums, Paul Linklater on guitar, and Doug Friesen on bass. Their debut album, The Land is Wild, was produced by Kerr and was released on Pheromone Recordings in 2009. Bidini's website describes the album features \\"more songs about dead hockey players, cannibalism and lesbian school teachers.\\"http://www.davebidini.ca In between records, the band hosted the annual \\"Stolen From a Hockey Card\\" concert at CBC's Hockey Day in Canada. They backed up musicians ranging from Sarah Harmer to John K. Samson to Bryan Trottier to Carmen Townshend performing original songs about hockey players and the games cultures. They have also been part of Bidini's annual Torn From the Pages literary event, which gathers musicians and writers to create original works based on a single work of fiction, including Linden MacIntyre's Why Men Lie and Michael Crummey's Galore. The band's second album, In the Rock Hall, was released on January 31, 2012 and recorded at Toronto's Revolution Recordings. The song \\"I Wanna Go to Yemen\\" was named one of the Top 100 songs of 2012 by CBC Radio 3. The album's title comes from a poem by Paul Quarrington.Kaplan, Ben. \\"Dave Bidini is living on the edge\\" . National Post. January 24, 2012. The band's third album, The Motherland, was released on May 29, 2014.\\"Stream The Motherland, the third album from BidiniBand\\". CBC Music, May 12, 2014. ==Writing== Bidini was first published at 11 years old in the Toronto Sun's \\"Young Sun\\" pullout section, writing a poem about Maple Leaf hockey player Eddie Shack. He started contributing for The Sunshine News, a national highschool newspaper, and later, Toronto alternative rock magazine Shades, for whom he interviewed Harlequin, Devo, The Dickies, R.E.M., Katrina and the Waves, The B-52s, The Ramones and other artists. Afterwards, he wrote for OP magazine as well as the Village Voice, which is where his first sports writing appeared – including \\"Why I Love Wayne,\\" which later became \\"Why I Love Wayne Bradley,\\" from his book The Five Hole Stories. In 1986, he wrote a piece about Canadian musician Stompin' Tom Connors for Nerve magazine, which ended up encouraging the exiled musician to come out of retirement (the story also appeared in Bidini's first book, On a Cold Road). Bidini was a columnist for the Toronto Star between 1991–1993; his stories were written on a portable typewriter from the road and submitted via gas station faxes, and his 1996 tour diary for the same paper became the essence of his first book. His second book, Tropic of Hockey, about playing hockey in China, Dubai and Transylvania, was named one of the Top 100 Canadian books of all-time, and established what would become the writer's template: travel, sports and music written from an experiential perspective. He has been called everything from \\"the Ry Cooder of hockey\\" to \\"George Plimpton soaked in maple syrup.\\" In 2010, broadcaster Ron MacLean told a Saturday night audience on Hockey Night in Canada that Bidini was \\"one of this country's most important voices in music and hockey\\" before premiering a track, \\"The Land is Wild,\\" from his band's first album. In 2007's Around the World in 57.5 Gigs, he documented being among the first ever Canadian rock bands to embark on a festival tour of China, performing in towns that had never seen western rock music before, and in Home and Away, he wrote about the experiences of Canada's homeless soccer team at the Homeless World Cup. After the book's success, Bidini later became a board member for Street Soccer Canada, a non-profit body that sends teams annually to the tournament. Bidini wrote a weekly Saturday column for the National Post, but was famously dismissed in 2015.https://nowtoronto.com/news/think-free-blog/national-post- dumps-dave-bidini-column/ His 2002 book Baseballissimo was optioned for the screen by co-producer Geddy Lee of Rush with a script written by actor Jay Baruchel (Goon). In 2011, On a Cold Road was named a finalist for Canada Reads, CBC Radio's national books contest. In 2009, he successfully championed Paul Quarrington's novel King Leary on the same series. ==Books== * On a Cold Road: Tales of Adventure in Canadian Rock (1998) * Tropic of Hockey (2001) * Baseballissimo (2004) * For Those About to Rock (2004) * The Best Game You Can Name (2005) * The Five Hole Stories (2006) * For Those About to Write: I Refute You (2007) * Around the World in 57½ Gigs (2007) * Home and Away: In Search of Dreams at the Homeless World Cup of Soccer (2010) * Writing Gordon Lightfoot: The Man, the Music, and the World in 1972 (2011) * A Wild Stab For It: This Is Game Eight From Russia (2012) * Keon and Me: The Search for the Lost Soul of the Toronto Maple Leafs (2013) * Midnight Light: A Personal Journey to The North (2018) ==Plays== Bidini has written two plays, Five Hole: Tales of Hockey Erotica, which was toured nationally in 2009 by One Yellow Rabbit, and The Night of the Dogs, which has been staged, in sections, by the sketch comedy group, The Imponderables. In 2012, Bidini lent the sketch group the song \\"I Wanna Go to Yemen\\" for their popular web series Bill and Sons Towing. ==Awards== He has won three National Magazine Awards for his writing. In 2010, his story \\"Travels in Narnia\\", published in Maisonneuve, placed first, and his article on Clara Hughes in the Calgary Herald's Swerve Magazine won an honourable mention. He previously won for the Saturday Night piece \\"Hockey Night in Dubai\\", which was later expanded into one of Tropic of Hockey's narrative triptych. His tenth book, Writing Gordon Lightfoot: The Man, the Music, and the World in 1972, was nominated for a Toronto Book Award in 2012. ==Films== Bidini wrote and hosted the Gemini Award-winning adaptation of Tropic of Hockey, called Hockey Nomad, which was first broadcast on CBC Television in January 2003. In the film, he travelled to Dubai, Transylvania and Mongolia to play the game and explore local hockey culture. His follow-up film was The Hockey Nomad Goes to Russia, which was nominated for a subsequent Gemini Award. In the film, Bidini became the only Canadian in history to dress as a member of the Russian Legends' national team, playing left defence on a touring club featuring members of the 1972 Russian national team, and others. The film features, amongst others, Alexander Yakushev, Yuri Blinov, Alexander Gusev and a 12-year-old Zhenya Kuznetsov, who six years later would be drafted by the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. The CBC also commissioned Bidini for a one-hour documentary on soccer entitled Kick in the Head for the 2008 Soccer Day in Canada. == References BidiniBand at Pheromone Recordings * * Dave Bidini author's page at the National Post Category:Canadian rock guitarists Category:Canadian male guitarists Category:Canadian songwriters Category:Canadian writers about music Category:Canadian sportswriters Category:Living people Category:Canadian diarists Category:Musicians from Toronto Category:Canadian indie rock musicians Category:1963 births Category:People from Etobicoke Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Post people Category:Writers from Toronto Category:20th- century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Canadian male writers Category:21st-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:20th- century Canadian guitarists Category:21st-century Canadian guitarists Category:Rheostatics members Category:Canadian male non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Canadian male musicians Category:21st-century Canadian male musicians ","title":"Dave Bidini"},{"id":"1422446","text":"War for the Oaks (1987) is a fantasy novel by American writer Emma Bull. The book tells the story of Eddi McCandry, a rock musician who finds herself unwillingly pulled into the supernatural faerie conflict between good and evil. War for the Oaks is one of the first works in the subgenre of urban fantasy: although it involves supernatural characters, the setting (Minneapolis) is decidedly real-world. ==Plot summary== Walking home one night through the streets of Minneapolis after quitting her rock band and breaking up with her boyfriend, Eddi McCandry discovers that she is being pursued by a threatening man and an even more threatening black dog. They turn out to be one and same: a shapeshifting prankster faerie known as a phouka, who drafts Eddi to be the linchpin in the ongoing battle between faerie's good and noble Seelie Court and the evil Unseelie Court, ruled by the Queen of Air and Darkness. Eddi soon finds herself in a struggle for survival against the Unseelie Court, all while trying to put a new rock band together. Meanwhile, her initial feelings of resentment toward the phouka develop into gratitude for his efforts to protect her against the dark queen, and ultimately turn into love. The novel climaxes in a rock concert playoff between Eddi and the Queen of Air and Darkness, which decides the fate of both faerie courts, as well as the fate of her loved one. ==Characters== ; Eddi McCandry: The book's protagonist. A guitarist and gifted singer; the nature of her gift is revealed during the course of the novel. Several plot points in the book involve her relationships with her ex-boyfriend Stuart Kline, Willy Silver, and the phouka. ; Phouka : A trickster faerie resembling the musician Prince with the ability to shapechange into a dog. He is never named in the book, although at one point in the novel he temporarily adopts the name Robin Goode. When he meets Eddi, he is nominally working on behalf of the Seelie Court, but it is revealed he has other motives for his actions. ; Carla DiAmato: Eddi's best friend and confidante, and drummer for her band. Carla is instrumental to the formation of the band - she pressures Eddi into starting one and suggests their name, Eddi and the Fey. ; Dan Rochelle: Keyboard player for Eddi's band. Eventually, he and Carla fall in love. ; Hedge: Bassist who responds to Eddi's classified ad. He is reserved most of the time, but at one point sings a soft, tuneful folk song. Member of Faerie, allied to the Seelie Court. ; Willy Silver: Lead guitarist who responds to Eddi's classified ad. Willy is one of the Daoine Sidhe and a member of the Seelie Court. ==Allusions/references from other works== Many references are made to British folklore. During the course of the novel, Eddi meets a glaistig, the phouka, a brownie, and redcaps. Many traditional beliefs about faeries are incorporated; for example, their aversion to rowan berries and St John's wort. Rock music also features prominently in the novel. Much of the novel is devoted to Eddi's efforts in putting together a rock band. Her band plays covers of songs by diverse musicians including Prince, Peter Gabriel, The Beatles, Kim Carnes, Men Without Hats, and Bram Tchaikovsky. Eddi also plays songs written by herself - in actuality of course, written by the author, Emma Bull. Some of these (including Wear My Face and For It All) were performed by the band Cats Laughing (of which Emma Bull is a member), and are on their second album Another Way To Travel. There are also references to historical landmarks of Minneapolis as locations for the story. Eddi is chased down Nicollet Mall at night by the phouka; the Fey battles take place at Minnehaha Falls and at Como Zoo and Conservatory; and her band, Eddi and the Fey, plays at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and at First Avenue, which is where the climactic playoff occurs for the fates of Minneapolis and the phouka.

His father, Bill Lipinski, held the seat which was previously numbered as the 5th district from 1983 to 2005. The district encompasses parts of southwestern Chicago as well as much of its nearby suburbs. A member of the Blue Dog Coalition, Lipinski represents a district described as \\"ancestrally Democratic, culturally conservative, multiethnic and viscerally patriotic\\" which has earned a reputation as being home to Reagan Democrats.Barone, Michael; Richard E. Cohen (2005). The Almanac of American Politics 2006. Washington, D.C.: National Journal Group. p. 567. . Lipinski has worked for a number of politicians, including U.S. Representatives George E. Sangmeister, Rod Blagojevich and Dick Gephardt, and Cook County State's Attorney Richard A. Devine. He has a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University. He taught at the University of Notre Dame from 2000 to 2001 and at the University of Tennessee from 2001 to 2004. In 2004, Lipinski's father won the Democratic primary for Illinois's 3rd congressional district, and shortly afterward withdrew his reelection bid. Upon Bill Lipinski’s retirement, the state Democratic Party chose the younger Lipinski to replace his father on the ballot. Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger in this heavily Democratic district. Lipinski has a reputation as one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. He did not endorse President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012, opposes legalized abortion and stem cell research, was the only House Democrat from Illinois to vote against the Affordable Care Act, supported reauthorizing the Patriot Act in 2006, and supported the Defense of Marriage and First Amendment Defense Acts. In January 2020, Lipinski, fellow Democratic Representative Collin Peterson, 166 Republican representatives and 39 Republican senators submitted an amicus curiae brief calling on the Supreme Court to reconsider and potentially overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, two cases that upheld abortion rights. Despite his social conservatism, Lipinski has voted with the Democratic Party 87% of the time since he's been in Congress.Simone Pathe. \\"Gillibrand PAC Endorses Lipinski Primary Challenger in Illinois\\". RollCall. Retrieved 1 August 2019. In 2020, Lipinski was defeated in the Democratic primary by progressive challenger Marie Newman, who had unsuccessfully challenged him in the 2018 primary. == Early life, education, and career == Lipinski was born in Chicago, the son of Rose Marie (née Lapinski) and former U.S. Congressman Bill Lipinski. He attended St. Ignatius College Prep, graduating in 1984. He received a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Northwestern University in 1988, an M.S. in engineering-economic systems from Stanford University in 1989 and a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University in 1998. In the summer of 1992, Lipinski interned at the United States Department of Labor. He interned for U.S. Congressman George E. Sangmeister from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996 Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman Jerry Costello. He then served on Cook County State's Attorney Richard A. Devine's campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman Rod Blagojevich's staff, Lipinski served as a communications staff aide to then-House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. From 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the University of Notre Dame. In 2001, he joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee, where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004. ==U.S. House of Representatives== In 2004 Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd district—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; since the younger Lipinski had not lived regularly in Illinois since 1989 or run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He then bought a home in Western Springs as his residence in the district. As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the general election. In the 2006 Democratic primary Lipinski won 55% of the vote against two opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski defeated Republican Michael Bendas with over 70% of the vote. Lipinski faced Marie Newman in the 2018 Democratic primary and defeated her with 51.2% of the vote to Newman's 48.8%. She challenged him again in 2020, as did Muslim-American activist and businessman Rush Darwish and local resident Charles Hughes. Another primary challenger, Abe Matthew, dropped out and endorsed Newman. Newman won the primary. ===Committee assignments=== Lipinski serves on two House Committees: Transportation & Infrastructure and Science, Space, & Technology. He is the most senior member from Illinois on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Aviation and the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, which he chairs. On the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Lipinski was previously the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research and sits on the Subcommittee on Energy. His district includes Argonne National Laboratory. * Committee on Science, Space & Technology ** Subcommittee on Research & Technology ** Subcommittee on Energy * Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure ** Subcommittee on Aviation ** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, & Hazardous Materials (Chairman) ** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit ===Caucus memberships=== * Blue Dog Coalition * Congressional Arts Caucus * Afterschool Caucuses * Congressional Buy American Caucus (Founder and co-chair) * Bi- partisan Congressional Pro-life Caucus (Co-chair) * Blue Collar Caucus * United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus * Veterinary Medicine Caucus * Climate Solutions Caucus ==Political positions== Lipinski is one of the most socially conservative Democrats in Congress. In recent years his district has been described as largely liberal, but it has long been the most conservative of the eight districts in and around Chicago, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+6; no other Chicago-based district has a PVI lower than D+15. The district earned a reputation as being home to Reagan Democrats when in the 1980 presidential election it was one of only two Chicago districts (out of nine) to be won by Republican Ronald Reagan.Guide to U.S. Elections (5th ed.). Washington, D.C.: CQ Press. 2005. p. 1217. . Lipinski has repeatedly argued that the Democratic Party is moving too far to the left, which he believes helped Donald Trump become president. ===Abortion and stem cell research=== Lipinski is anti-abortion and serves as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. He is a co-sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. In June 2013, Lipinski was one of only six Democrats in Congress who voted for a nationwide 20-week abortion ban. In 2007, Lipinski voted against legislation to increase funding for embryonic stem cell research. ===Barack Obama=== Lipinski did not endorse President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012.Robert Anderrson, \\"Illinois Democratic congressman won't endorse Obama \\" October 30, 2012 Medill Reports ===Economy=== Lipinski introduced the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act on June 12, 2012. The bill would require the government to implement policies that support manufacturing products that qualify for the \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" label, such as the establishment of a Manufacturing Strategy Board within the United States Department of Commerce that includes federal officials, two state governors from different parties, and nine private-sector leaders and stakeholders from the manufacturing industry. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012, by a 339–77 vote. Lipinski has proposed what he calls a \\"Five-Point Jobs Plan\\". According to Lipinski, the plan would \\"strengthen manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, educate the workforce, force other countries to trade fairly and invest in innovation.\\" ===Foreign policy and national security=== After the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement broke out, Lipinski joined Senator Sherrod Brown's and Representative Chris Smith's effort to introduce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would update the United States–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. He expressed support for Hong Kong's autonomy and the pro-democracy protests, saying, \\"conducting free and fair elections by universal suffrage is a guarantee that China itself made to Hong Kong. Any effort to end these demonstrations with aggressive force or disrupt the unique government structure that exists between China and Hong Kong will have a serious impact on China's relationship with the many nations of this world that stand for democracy and freedom.\\"S.2922 – Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , Congress.gov, November 13, 2014H.R.5696 – Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , Congress.gov, November 13, 2014H.R.1159 – Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , Congress.gov, February 27, 2015 Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment Act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent. === Healthcare === Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which passed the House on March 21, 2010. He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion. Lipinski had previously voted for a version of the bill that contained more stringent restrictions on abortion funding. In 2017 he said he was trying to prevent Republicans from repealing Obamacare. In October 2013 Lipinski was the primary sponsor of HR3425, which would have delayed any penalties under the PPACA until four months after the program's website was fully functional. === Immigration === In 2018, while facing a strong primary challenge, Lipinski expressed support for creating a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as minors). Previously he voted against the DREAM Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for those individuals. === LGBT rights === Lipinski opposed recognition of same-sex marriage until the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges. In 2011, he supported the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to gay couples. The portion of DOMA that prohibited gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013; by 2015, Lipinski had not publicly changed his support for DOMA. Lipinski supported the First Amendment Defense Act, which would prohibit the federal government from requiring that some businesses not discriminate against same-sex couples. In 2009 Lipinski voted for the Hate Crimes Expansion bill, which expands the definition of hate crime and strengthens enforcement of hate-crime laws. In 2010 he voted in favor of repealing Don't ask, don't tell. Lipinski now says he personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports the status quo \\"because it has been declared the law of the land.\\" In 2016, he supported the Republican version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which sought to allow businesses to deny services to individuals if they felt providing service would violate their religious beliefs. ==Electoral history== ==References== ==External links== * Congressman Daniel Lipinski official U.S. House website * Dan Lipinski for Congress * * - - Category:1966 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Catholics from Illinois Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Duke University alumni Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois Category:People from Western Springs, Illinois Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:Robert R.

Its creators, functional programming researchers Simon Peyton Jones and Norman Ramsey, designed it to be generated mainly by compilers for very high-level languages rather than written by human programmers. Unlike many other intermediate languages, its representation is plain ASCII text, not bytecode or another binary format. There are two main branches of C--. One is the original C-- branch, with the final version 2.0 released in May 2005. The other is the Cmm fork actively used by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler as its intermediate representation. == Design == C-- is a \\"portable assembly language\\", designed to ease the task of implementing a compiler which produces high quality machine code. This is done by having the compiler generate C-- code, delegating the harder work of low-level code generation and optimisation to a C-- compiler. Work on C-- began in the late 1990s. Since writing a custom code generator is a challenge in itself, and the compiler back ends available to researchers at that time were complex and poorly documented, several projects had written compilers which generated C code (for instance, the original Modula-3 compiler). However, C is a poor choice for functional languages: it does not guarantee tail call optimization, or support accurate garbage collection or efficient exception handling. C-- is a simpler, tightly- defined alternative to C which does support all of these things. Its most innovative feature is a run-time interface which allows writing of portable garbage collectors, exception handling systems and other run-time features which work with any C-- compiler. The language's syntax borrows heavily from C. It omits or changes standard C features such as variadic functions, pointer syntax, and aspects of C's type system, because they hamper certain essential features of C-- and the ease with which code-generation tools can produce it. The name of the language is an in-joke, indicating that C-- is a reduced form of C, in the same way that C++ is basically an expanded form of C. (In C-like languages, \\"--\\" and \\"++\\" are operators meaning \\"decrement\\" and \\"increment\\".) The first version of C-- was released in April 1998 as a MSRA paper, accompanied by a January 1999 paper on garbage collection. A revised manual was posted in HTML form in May 1999. Two sets of major changes proposed in 2000 by Norman Ramsey (\\"Proposed Changes\\") and Christian Lindig (\\"A New Grammar\\") lead to C-- version 2, which was finalized around 2004 and officially released in 2005. == Type system == The C-- type system is deliberately designed to reflect constraints imposed by hardware rather than conventions imposed by higher-level languages. In C--, a value stored in a register or memory may have only one type: bit vector. However, bit vector is a polymorphic type and may come in several widths, e.g., , , or . A separate 32-or-64 bit family of floating-point types is supported. In addition to the bit-vector type, C-- also provides a Boolean type , which can be computed by expressions and used for control flow but cannot be stored in a register or in memory. As in an assembly language, any higher type discipline, such as distinctions between signed, unsigned, float, and pointer, is imposed by the C-- operators or other syntactic constructs in the language. C-- version 2 removes the distinction between bit-vector and floating-point types. Programmers are allowed to annotate these types with a string \\"kind\\" tag to distinguish, among other things, a variable's integer vs float typing and its storage behavior (global or local). The first part is useful on targets that have separate registers for integer and floating-point values. In addition, special types for pointers and the native word is introduced, although all they do is mapping to a bit vector with a target-dependent length. C-- is not type-checked, nor does it enforce or check the calling convention. == Implementations == The specification page of C-- lists a few implementations of C--. The \\"most actively developed\\" compiler, Quick C--, was abandoned in 2013. === Haskell === A C-- dialect called Cmm is the intermediate representation for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. GHC backends are responsible for further transforming C-- into executable code, via LLVM IR, slow C, or directly through the built-in native backend.GHC Backends Some of the developers of C--, including Simon Peyton Jones, João Dias, and Norman Ramsey, work or have worked on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. Work on GHC has also led to extensions in the C-- language, forming the Cmm dialect. Cmm uses the C preprocessor for ergonomics.GHC Commentary: What the hell is a .cmm file? Despite the original intention, GHC does perform many of its generic optimizations on C--. As with other compiler IRs, GHC allows for dumping the C-- representation for debugging.Debugging compilers with optimization fuel Target-specific optimizations are, of course, performed later by the backend. ==See also== * BCPL * LLVM ==References== ==External links== * Archive of old official website (cminusminus.org) * Quick C-- code archive (the reference implementation) Category:C programming language family Category:Compilers ","title":"C--"},{"id":"1422468","text":"The Wellington Cathedral of St Paul (also called St Paul's Cathedral or Wellington Cathedral) is an Anglican church in the city of Wellington, New Zealand. It is the mother church of the Diocese of Wellington and the cathedral of the Bishop of Wellington. Situated in Thorndon, the main entrance to the cathedral is on Hill Street, at its junction with Molesworth Street; it is located close to the parliament precinct. The building was designed in the 1930s by New Zealand architect Cecil Wood. Construction began in 1954, and was completed in 1998. It was constructed in reinforced concrete due to the effects of the 1931 Napier earthquake making other choices impractical. The church was initially envisioned as a war memorial cathedral, and it was designed on a monumental scale. Archbishop of New Zealand Reginald Herbert Owen declared in 1958: \\"Every nation needs in its capital city a great church to express its belief in the things of the spirit\\". The building began to be used as an Anglican cathedral in 1964 (replacing Old St Paul's), and was consecrated in 2001. ==Services== As well as being a popular attraction, St Paul's Cathedral is a working church with daily services. The cathedral, as the largest church in Wellington, also plays a role in many state occasions. , the normal services are held: *Monday–Friday: Morning Prayer, 8.15am *Monday–Wednesday and Friday: Evening Prayer, 5.15pm *Thursday: Choral Evensong, 5.30pm *Sunday: Choral Eucharist and Choral Evensong, 10am and 5pm respectively Choral services often involve the Cathedral Choir. Services normally follow the New Zealand Prayer Book, or other modern printed liturgy. ==History== ===Background=== Mulgrave Street in 1866, with Old St Paul's, the pro-cathedral, on the right The first Church of St Paul stood behind where the Beehive stands today. This served as the first Anglican parish church for the early British settlers. As early as the 1840s preparations for a cathedral had been made and bricks were laid. However, the first project came to an end in 1855 after an earthquake hit Wellington, which highlighted the unsuitability of brick buildings in such an area. Construction of a second church, today known as \\"Old St Paul's\\", located behind the Pipitea Marae, began in 1855. It was the pro-cathedral church for the Anglican Diocese of Wellington from 1866 to 1964. Old St Paul's is still consecrated, owned by Heritage New Zealand. In 1907, the diocese acquired land for a permanent cathedral, a site close to the Basin Reserve. In July 1917, the diocesan synod approved preliminary plans drawn up by architect Frank Peck for an elaborate Gothic structure on the site. It was to include a memorial military chapel in the west wing, in which the names of all New Zealanders who had fallen in the Boer War and First World War would be commemorated, and flags of the regiments displayed. Fund-raising for the proposed \\"Wellington Memorial Cathedral\\" began the following year, with collections even in England. However, in 1923, the synod decided the original ambitious plans were too costly to proceed with. ===Construction=== Cecil Wood, H St Barbe Holland and Will Appleton discussing plans for the new Wellington Cathedral in 1945 (from left) Plans were revived in 1937, when it was decided to make the cathedral a project for the national centennial of 1940. The diocese selected Cecil Wood, a New Zealand architect, to design the building. A new site was acquired on Molesworth Street, close to the Parliament Buildings and the Roman Catholic Cathedral. After the 1931 Napier earthquake, the decision was made to construct the cathedral primarily out of reinforced concrete, which was deemed to be more earthquake-resistant. Wood was inspired by the Art Deco architecture of Southern California, and the neo- Byzantine-style of the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral, London. His final design, which has been implemented relatively unchanged, was a long and high building. Cathedral foundation stone, laid by the Queen on 13 January 1954. Construction of the new cathedral was delayed by the Second World War and its aftermath, and ultimately the project took about 50 years to complete. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 January 1954; the first stage was dedicated on 17 May 1964; the second stage was dedicated on 5 November 1972. The cathedral's bell tower was added in 1984, and dedicated on Easter Day, April 1984. In 1992, the diocesan synod decided to raise money for a third and final stage of construction. The completed cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1998 and consecrated on 15 October 2001; finally, on 24 February 2002, the Queen unveiled the consecration stone. ==Chapels== The wooden Lady Chapel is along the ambulatory to the left of the pulpit. The Lady Chapel was formerly the parish church of St Paul's at Paraparaumu. Designed by the diocesan architect Frederick de Jersey Clere, the chapel was opened on its Paraparaumu site in 1905. It was moved to the grounds of Wellington Cathedral in 1990, and consecrated on 12 May 1991. A second smaller chapel space is located to the left of the entrance. It is furnished plainly with a small altar. ==Features== ===Artwork and memorials=== One of the Hutton glass angels; the dossal is visible through the glass The cathedral's nave contains many stained-glass windows by church artist Brian Thomas, who had previously designed windows in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral, London. Thomas took as his theme words of St Paul at the Areopagus: “The Unknown God: Him I now proclaim”. The windows were created by Whitefriars of London and depict figures and scenes such as the conversion of St Paul; Jacob, the patriarch who wrestled with an angel; Moses, the law giver; David the hero King; the nativity of Jesus; and Christ's crucifixion and the resurrection. The narthex (lobby) is separated from the rest of the nave by a wall consisting of glass panels depicting figures representing angels. The etchings are the work of New Zealand-born artist John Hutton. Similar work by Hutton exists in Coventry Cathedral in England. ====Holm Window==== The Holm Window, installed 1970 In 1970, the Holm Memorial Window was installed above the three doors leading to the cathedral's Loaves and Fishes Hall. It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, a leading New Zealand stained-glass artist, and made by Roy Miller of Dunedin. The window is a memorial to prominent Wellington businessman Ferdinand Holm, founder of the Holm Shipping Company, and his wife Mary. St Paul, the patron saint of the cathedral, is shown at the top of the centre panel; the top of the left panel depicts the stars of the Southern Cross and the flag of the Company; three ships represent stages in the development of the Company. ====War memorials==== Although plans for a military chapel had been abandoned during construction, the cathedral authorities did allow for the installation of three sets of memorial windows in the Sanctuary—allocating two lancets each to the Army, Navy and Air Force. Fund-raising for the two Air Force windows began in September 1957. Designed by the English artist Edward Liddall Armitage, these were installed in April 1962. They are dedicated to the members of the Air Force and New Zealanders who died in the service of the air forces of the Commonwealth during the Second World War. The four remaining windows were designed by New Zealand artist Howard Malitte and adapted for stained-glass by Brian Thomas. Governor-General Brigadier Sir Bernard Fergusson unveiled the Army memorial windows on 9 August 1966. They stand on either side of the organ loft, with the memorial tablet placed on the wall to the left of the Bishop's cathedra (\\"The two windows above this tablet were installed by serving and former members of the New Zealand Army to commemorate those who have served in the New Zealand Army at home and abroad since the foundation of our country…\\"). The naval and merchant service windows were unveiled on 22 October 1967. They were dedicated in memory of the men and women who lost their lives in the navies and merchant services of the Commonwealth during the two world wars. All six military windows incorporate a rich visual symbolism. A range of memorial flags is also housed in the bell tower. The Memorial to Chunuk Bair, installed in 1998, is one of four memorials erected to commemorate New Zealand soldiers who died in the Battle of Gallipoli and whose graves are not known. ====Dossal==== The Sanctuary is dominated by a large altarpiece—a hanging artwork referred to as a dossal. It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, and installed in 1990. It consists of three panels, in total measuring approximately by . The centre panel depicts the Risen Christ; the two side sections contain symbols used in historic Christian art. ===Font=== The wooden baptismal font, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is designed to be moved around the cathedral. During Eastertide it is placed in the centre of the nave. The base is decorated with four silver panels of cherubim; the cover depicts a dove, symbolising the Holy Spirit which descended on Christ after his baptism. ===Organ=== The organ, located above the choir stalls in the chancel, January 2016 In 1980, the cathedral organ was rebuilt and enlarged. It had been first installed in Old St Paul's in 1877 as a two-manual tracker action instrument blown by water pressure. The console now has four manuals, 81 stops and there are some 3,500 pipes. The organ suffered \\"significant damage\\" after an earthquake in November 2016. Following the damage to the old organ, the cathedral used two temporary digital organs. In October 2018, a replacement digital organ, a Viscount Regent Classic, was installed in place of the old one; it features four manuals, 85 stops and 42 speakers. ===Bells=== The cathedral's bell tower is one of only seven in New Zealand where change ringing takes place. It has 14 bells, ranging in size from Little James, weighing in at 4 cwt (200 kg) to the People's Bell at 27¾ cwt (1,400 kg). The bells were installed in 1984; seven of the bells are over 100 years old and were moved from a demolished church, St Edmund's in Northampton, England. ==Deans of St Paul== The Chapter of St Paul has had eight deans: * 1948–1962: David Jones Davies * 1963–1977: Walter Edmund Wilmshurst Hurst * 1978–1985: James Thomas * 1985–2002: Michael Henry Brown * 2003–2004: Douglas Everett Sparks\\"Dean quits Wellington Cathedral to return to US\\", The New Zealand Herald, 8 June 2004, (Retrieved 9 February 2013) * 2004–2012: Frank Nelson (afterwards Dean of Adelaide, 2012) * 2012–2018: Digby Wilkinson *2018–present: David Rowe ==Gallery== File:Cathedral of St Paul's, Wellington, NZ (5943119395).jpgMain entrance of the cathedral off Hill Street.

His plane was a Cessna Model AW with a Warner-Scarab engine, one of only 48 built, that he called \\"The Kangaroo\\". He set the east- to-west, then the west-to-east, and the combined round trip record. He was the youngest certificated pilot in the United States, and the youngest certified airplane mechanic. He was a pilot in the Spanish Civil War in the Yankee Squadron. He died in an airplane crash in 1940, while training another pilot, when a Boeing-Stearman Model 75 belonging to the United States Navy Reserve overtook him and clipped his plane's tail at Floyd Bennett Field. ==Birth and family== Eddie August Henry Schneider was born on October 20, 1911 at 2nd Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan in New York. His father was Emil August Schneider (1886–1955) who was born in Bielefeld, Germany. His mother was Inga Karoline Eldora Pedersen (1882–1927), who was born in Farsund, Norway.United States passport for Emil August Schneider from April 14, 1921 Eddie had one full sibling: Alice Violetta Schneider (1913–2002) who married John Harms (1905–1985). He was never called Edward, he was baptized as \\"Eddie Auguste Henry Schneider\\" on November 12, 1911 at Our Saviour's Lutheran Church in Queens, New York City. == Early years == The family moved from Manhattan to Red Bank, New Jersey, and then to Jersey City, New Jersey by 1920 where his father owned a delicatessen. Eddie attended William L. Dickinson High School and dropped out of school in 1926, at age 15 to go to work as a plane mechanic at Roosevelt Field in Hempstead, Long Island. His mother died In 1927 after which he, his father, and sister visited Bielefeld and Farsund to visit with relatives. In Germany Eddie went on a plane ride from Hamburg to Hanover and then aviation became his obsession. In 1928–1929 he trained at Roosevelt Field on Long Island and became the youngest person in the United States to receive a commercial pilot certificate. That same year he also received a mechanics certificate, becoming the youngest certificated airplane mechanic in New York. In April 1930 Eddie was living in Hempstead, Long Island with Carl Schneider (1898-?) who was also working as a mechanic. Eddie's father bought him a used, red, 1927 Cessna Model AW monoplane with tail number C9092. It already had been flown five hundred thousand air miles. He called it \\"the kangaroo\\". == Transcontinental air speed record == Eddie reported that he intended to fly to the Pacific coast and back on July 30, 1930. On August 25, 1930 he set the round-trip transcontinental air speed record for pilots under the age of twenty-one years in his Cessna using a Warner Scarab engine. The trip was sponsored by Richfield Oil. He flew from Westfield, New Jersey on August 14, 1930 to Los Angeles, California in 4 days with a combined flying time of 29 hours and 55 minutes. He lowered the East to West record by 4 hours and 22 minutes. He then made the return trip from Los Angeles to Roosevelt Airfield in New York in 27 hours and 19 minutes, lowering the West to East record by 1 hour and 36 minutes. His total elapsed time for the round trip was 57 hours and 14 minutes, breaking the preceding record for the round trip. Frank Herbert Goldsborough held the previous record which was 62 hours and 58 minutes. When Eddie landed in New York on August 25, 1930, his first words were to his father: \\"Hello Pop, I made it.\\" He was carrying letters from the Mayor John Clinton Porter of Los Angeles, to Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City. Combined he set three records. ==Air tours== After setting the transcontinental speed record he entered in the 1930 Ford National Reliability Air Tour in Chicago, which ran from August 23, 1930, to September 1, 1930. He won the Great Lakes Trophy. Nancy Hopkins also flew in the tour that year. In 1931 Eddie participated in, what was the last Ford National Reliability Air Tour, in his Cessna. A defect in his engine forced a landing while flying over a mountainous section of Kentucky. He made a forced landing in a corn patch on the side of the mountain. A new engine was sent to him and after a difficult takeoff, he went on to win first place for single engine aircraft, and finished third overall. Time wrote: During one of the National Air Tours, Schneider had taken off in his Cessna with the Warner Scarab engine, from Chicago bound for the balloon races in Cleveland. He saw the crowd scatter below, looked up and saw the 40-foot left wing of a twenty passenger Burnelli transport plane directly over him. Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled to the other side of the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races. ==Marriage== In 1932 he went to work for the Hoover Air League as co-director of the Aviation Division. He married Gretchen Frances Hahnen (1902–1986) in New York City on June 2, 1934 at the New York Municipal Building in Manhattan. Gretchen was the daughter of Zora Montgomery Courtney (1882–1962) and was originally from Peoria, Illinois. Her father was Herman F. Hahnen from Des Moines, Iowa. She was a member the Jersey City Young Woman's Christian Association (YWCA) and was director of the Aviation Club of The Jersey Journal, and the editor of the Junior Club Magazine. Eddie met her at an aviation function. They did not have any children. == Jersey City Airport == Starting on January 1, 1935, Eddie leased the Jersey City Airport and ran his flying school from there until the field was converted into a sports stadium using WPA money. Eddie was taking off in a Travel Air three-seat, open-cockpit biplane with his student, Fred Weigel (1904–1990), when the motor died. From an altitude of 100 feet they crashed into Newark Bay, but were unhurt and were able to walk ashore. He also taught Herbert Sargent to fly with just 55 minutes in lessons. == Spanish Civil War == In 1936, Eddie left for Spain to fly in the Yankee Squadron for the Spanish Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War with Frederic Ives Lord, Bertrand Blanchard Acosta, and Gordon Berry. They were recruited by a lawyer in New York City. Time magazine wrote on December 21, 1936: He was living at 50 Jones Street in Jersey City at the time he was recruited. He was promised he would be paid $1,500 ($ today) each month and given a bonus of $1,000 ($ today) for every rebel plane he shot down. Another American flyer, Hilaire du Berrier, was already is Spain by time they arrived. Frederic Ives Lord became their squadron commander, and he tried to convince the Loyalist authorities that the planes they were given were too dilapidated to fly. When the commandant insisted that the planes were safe, Lord took him up for a test flight, and at two thousand feet up one of the four wings broke off. The commandant motioned Lord to climb higher so they could escape by using their parachutes. Lord wanted to try to land with the remaining lower wings intact. He landed the plane safely but he was arrested and was going to be shot. The airplane mechanics intervened and explained that his loss of the wing was accidental, not intentional. Things became so difficult and dangerous for the Americans that each time one of them landed they pulled out their pistols in case someone was coming to arrest them. They went to Valencia, Spain to complain to the air ministry, but the ministry was only interested in reading to the flyers the reports on Bertrand Blanchard Acosta and his heavy drinking. Berry, Lord, Acosta and Schneider decided it was time to demobilize and return to the United States. Acosta, Schneider and Lord planned to escape from Bilbao to Biarritz, France by motorboat after they had been refused a promised Christmas leave. Their plan was discovered and the pilot of their boat was arrested and executed. The pilots were then jailed for 18 hours. On returning to New York City in January 1937, Schneider claimed he was never paid in full. Spain claimed that they were paid in full, and were not owed any money. Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: > I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet despite the fact that all three of us > are old-time aviators who did our part for the development of the industry, > we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. > Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said \\"This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got to the point where we did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back.\\" The flyers had their passports confiscated, and they were to be returned when they attested that they had never forsworn allegiance to America. == Middle years == In 1938 Eddie stood at 5-foot, 8 inches (68 inches) and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg).World War II draft registration He had blue eyes and blond hair, and he was living at 38 Broadway in Manhattan. Eddie began work for American Airlines at Newark Airport in New Jersey, he then moved to Jackson Heights, Queens on Long Island, when the American Airlines eastern terminal had moved to LaGuardia Airport. Eddie registered for the draft on October 16, 1940 when he was living at 32-50 73rd Street in Jackson Heights, Queens in New York.H. V. Pat Reilly; Balloon to the Moon (1992); == Death == On December 23, 1940, around 1:25 pm, Eddie was killed in an accident at Floyd Bennett Field at age 29,Eddie Schneider's death certificate while training George Wilson Herzog (1903–1940). They were flying at about 600 feet, about to land, when United States Navy Reserve pilot Kenneth A. Kuehner, age 25, of Minster, Ohio struck the tail assembly of Eddie's plane with his Boeing-Stearman Model 75. Eddie's plane went into a spin and crashed into Deep Creek, just off of Flatbush Avenue. Both Herzog and Schneider were dead at the scene of impact. The bodies were taken to King's County Hospital, and Eddie's cause of death was listed as \\"crushed chest & abdomen; hemothorax & hemoperitoneum in aeroplane crash\\". The accident was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and Kuehner was ruled at fault for flying too low and failing to observe the traffic in front of him. The air traffic controllers were also chastised.Civil Aeronautics Board Investigation of July 1941, box 14 The United States House of Representatives reported the accident as follows on November 7, 1941: > It appears that on December 23, 1940, a private plane piloted by Eddie > Schneider was struck by a Navy plane, piloted by Ensign Kenneth A.

On February 13, 1942 Gretchen again appealed to Congress for financial relief with HR 5290. Around 1953–1954 Gretchen donated Schneider's books to the Smithsonian Institution and they are now housed at the National Air and Space Museum. In 1961 she was given an award by the Early Fliers Club of Long Island. ==Aircraft== * 1927 Cessna Model AW called \\"the Kangaroo\\".

It occurs most commonly around 25 weeks of pregnancy. Symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, and dangerously low blood pressure. Complications for the mother can include disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and kidney failure. Complications for the baby can include fetal distress, low birthweight, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. The cause of placental abruption is not entirely clear. Risk factors include smoking, preeclampsia, prior abruption, trauma during pregnancy, cocaine use, and previous cesarean section. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and supported by ultrasound. It is classified as a complication of pregnancy. For small abruption bed rest may be recommended while for more significant abruptions or those that occur near term, delivery may be recommended. If everything is stable vaginal delivery may be tried, otherwise cesarean section is recommended. In those less than 36 weeks pregnant, corticosteroids may be given to speed development of the baby's lungs. Treatment may require blood transfusion or emergency hysterectomy. Placental abruption occurs in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. Along with placenta previa and uterine rupture it is one of the most common causes of vaginal bleeding in the later part of pregnancy. Placental abruption is the reason for about 15% of infant deaths around the time of birth. The condition was described at least as early as 1664. == Signs and symptoms == In the early stages of placental abruption, there may be no symptoms. When symptoms develop, they tend to develop suddenly. Common symptoms include sudden-onset abdominal pain, contractions that seem continuous and do not stop, vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus disproportionate to the gestational age of the fetus, decreased fetal movement, and decreased fetal heart rate. Vaginal bleeding, if it occurs, may be bright red or dark. A placental abruption caused by arterial bleeding at the center of the placenta leads to sudden development of severe symptoms and life-threatening conditions including fetal heart rate abnormalities, severe maternal hemorrhage, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Those abruptions caused by venous bleeding at the periphery of the placenta develop more slowly and cause small amounts of bleeding, intrauterine growth restriction, and oligohydramnios (low levels of amniotic fluid). ==Risk factors== * Pre-eclampsia * Chronic hypertension. * Short umbilical cord * Prolonged rupture of membranes (>24 hours). * Thrombophilia * Multiparity * Multiple pregnancy * Maternal age: pregnant women who are younger than 20 or older than 35 are at greater risk Risk factors for placental abruption include disease, trauma, history, anatomy, and exposure to substances. The risk of placental abruption increases sixfold after severe maternal trauma. Anatomical risk factors include uncommon uterine anatomy (e.g. bicornuate uterus), uterine synechiae, and leiomyoma. Substances that increase risk of placental abruption include cocaine and tobacco when consumed during pregnancy, especially the third trimester. History of placental abruption or previous Caesarian section increases the risk by a factor of 2.3. == Pathophysiology == In the vast majority of cases, placental abruption is caused by the maternal vessels tearing away from the decidua basalis, not the fetal vessels. The underlying cause is often unknown. A small number of abruptions are caused by trauma that stretches the uterus. Because the placenta is less elastic than the uterus, it tears away when the uterine tissue stretches suddenly. When anatomical risk factors are present, the placenta does not attach in a place that provides adequate support, and it may not develop appropriately or be separated as it grows. Cocaine use during the third trimester has a 10% chance of causing abruption. Though the exact mechanism is not known, cocaine and tobacco cause systemic vasoconstriction, which can severely restrict the placental blood supply (hypoperfusion and ischemia), or otherwise disrupt the vasculature of the placenta, causing tissue necrosis, bleeding, and therefore abruption. In most cases, placental disease and abnormalities of the spiral arteries develop throughout the pregnancy and lead to necrosis, inflammation, vascular problems, and ultimately, abruption. Because of this, most abruptions are caused by bleeding from the arterial supply, not the venous supply. Production of thrombin via massive bleeding causes the uterus to contract and leads to DIC. The accumulating blood pushes between the layers of the decidua, pushing the uterine wall and placenta apart. When the placenta is separated, it is unable to exchange waste, nutrients, and oxygen, a necessary function for the fetus's survival. The fetus dies when it no longer receives enough oxygen and nutrients to survive. == Diagnosis == Ultrasound showing placental abruption. Placental abruption is suspected when a pregnant mother has sudden localized abdominal pain with or without bleeding. The fundus may be monitored because a rising fundus can indicate bleeding. An ultrasound may be used to rule out placenta praevia but is not diagnostic for abruption. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, meaning other possible sources of vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain have to be ruled out in order to diagnose placental abruption. Of note, use of magnetic resonance imaging has been found to be highly sensitive in depicting placental abruption, and may be considered if no ultrasound evidence of placental abruption is present, especially if the diagnosis of placental abruption would change management. === Classification === Based on severity: * Class 0: Asymptomatic. Diagnosis is made retrospectively by finding an organized blood clot or a depressed area on a delivered placenta. * Class 1: Mild and represents approximately 48% of all cases. Characteristics include the following: ** No vaginal bleeding to mild vaginal bleeding ** Slightly tender uterus ** Normal maternal blood pressure and heart rate ** No coagulopathy ** No fetal distress * Class 2: Moderate and represents approximately 27% of all cases. Characteristics include the following: ** No vaginal bleeding to moderate vaginal bleeding ** Moderate-to-severe uterine tenderness with possible tetanic contractions ** Maternal tachycardia with orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate ** Fetal distress ** Hypofibrinogenemia (i.e., 50–250 mg/dL) * Class 3: Severe and represents approximately 24% of all cases. Characteristics include the following: ** No vaginal bleeding to heavy vaginal bleeding ** Very painful tetanic uterus ** Maternal shock ** Hypofibrinogenemia (i.e., <150 mg/dL) ** Coagulopathy ** Fetal death == Prevention == Although the risk of placental abruption cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced. Avoiding tobacco, alcohol and cocaine during pregnancy decreases the risk. Staying away from activities which have a high risk of physical trauma is also important. Women who have high blood pressure or who have had a previous placental abruption and want to conceive must be closely supervised by a doctor. The risk of placental abruption can be reduced by maintaining a good diet including taking folate, regular sleep patterns and correction of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Use of aspirin before 16 weeks of pregnancy to prevent pre-eclampsia also appears effective at preventing placental abruption. == Management == Treatment depends on the amount of blood loss and the status of the fetus. If the fetus is less than 36 weeks and neither mother or fetus are in any distress, then they may simply be monitored in hospital until a change in condition or fetal maturity whichever comes first. Immediate delivery of the fetus may be indicated if the fetus is mature or if the fetus or mother is in distress. Blood volume replacement to maintain blood pressure and blood plasma replacement to maintain fibrinogen levels may be needed. Vaginal birth is usually preferred over Caesarean section unless there is fetal distress. Caesarean section carries an increased risk in cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation. People should be monitored for 7 days for postpartum hemorrhage. Excessive bleeding from uterus may necessitate hysterectomy. The mother may be given Rhogam if she is Rh negative. == Prognosis == The prognosis of this complication depends on whether treatment is received by the patient, on the quality of treatment, and on the severity of the abruption. Outcomes for the baby also depend on the gestational age. In the Western world, maternal deaths due to placental abruption are rare. The fetal prognosis is worse than the maternal prognosis; approximately 12% of fetuses affected by placental abruption die. 77% of fetuses that die from placental abruption die before birth; the remainder die due to complications of preterm birth. Without any form of medical intervention, as often happens in many parts of the world, placental abruption has a high maternal mortality rate. ===Mother=== * A large loss of blood may require a blood transfusion. * If the mother's blood loss cannot be controlled, an emergency hysterectomy may become necessary. * The uterus may not contract properly after delivery so the mother may need medication to help her uterus contract. * The mother may develop a blood clotting disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation. * A severe case of shock may affect other organs, such as the liver, kidney, and pituitary gland. Diffuse cortical necrosis in the kidney is a serious and often fatal complication. * Placental abruption may cause bleeding through the uterine muscle and into the mother's abdominal cavity, a condition called Couvelaire uterus. * Maternal death. ===Baby=== * The baby may be born at a low birthweight. * Preterm delivery (prior to 37 weeks gestation). * The baby may be deprived of oxygen and thus develop asphyxia. * Placental abruption may also result in death of the baby, or stillbirth. * The newborn infant may have learning issues at later development stages, often requiring professional pedagogical aid. == Epidemiology == Placental abruption occurs in approximately 0.2–1% of all pregnancies. Though different causes change when abruption is most likely to occur, the majority of placental abruptions occur before 37 weeks gestation, and 14% occur before 32 weeks gestation. == References == == External links == Category:Health issues in pregnancy Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Placental abruption"},{"id":"1422482","text":"Captain William Fly (died 12 July 1726) was an English pirate who raided New England shipping fleets for three months in 1726 until he was captured by the crew of a seized ship. He was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts and his body publicly exhibited as a warning to other pirates. His death is considered by many to mark the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. ==Career== William Fly's career as a pirate began in April 1726 when he signed on to sail with Captain John Green to West Africa on the Elizabeth. Green and Fly began to clash until one night William led a mutiny that resulted in Capt. Green being tossed overboard; Fly then took command of the Elizabeth. Having captured the ship, the mutineers sewed a Jolly Roger flag, renamed the ship Fames' Revenge, elected William Fly as captain, and sailed to the coast of North Carolina and north toward New England. They captured five ships in about two months before being captured themselves. Following his capture, Cotton Mather tried, and failed, to get Fly to publicly repent. William Fly and his crew were hanged at Boston Harbor on 12 July 1726. Reportedly, Fly approached the hanging with complete disdain and even reproached the hangman for doing a poor job, re- tying the noose and placing it about his neck with his own two hands. His last words were, roughly, a warning to captains to treat their sailors well and pay them on time - \\"Our Captain and his Mate used us Barbarously. We poor Men can’t have Justice done us. There is nothing said to our Commanders, let them never so much abuse us, and use us like Dogs.\\" Fly urged that \\"all Masters of Vessels might take Warning of the Fate of the Captain that he had murder'd, and to pay Sailors their Wages when due.\\" Following Fly's execution his body was hung in chains (gibbeted) on Nixes Mate Island in Boston Harbor as a warning to others not to turn to piracy. ==References== ==Further reading== *Flemming, Gregory.

The exam is administered on the first saturday in December.http://math.scu.edu/putnam/ ==Mathletic off-season training== The academic off-season (traditionally referred to as \\"summer\\") can be especially difficult on mathletes, though various training regimens have been proposed to keep mathletic ability at its peak. Publications such as the MAA's The American Mathematical Monthly and the AMS's Notices of the American Mathematical Society are widely read to maintain and hone mathematical ability. Some coaches suggest seeking research internships or grants, many of which are funded by the National Science Foundation. At higher levels, mathletes can obtain funding from host institutions to work on summer research projects. For example, the University of Delaware offers the Groups Exploring the Mathematical Sciences project (GEMS project) to first year graduate students. The students act as the principal investigator and work with an undergraduate research assistant and a faculty adviser who will oversee their summer research. ==References== ==External links== * World Math Day * Algorithm Olympics Category:Education terminology Category:Mathematics competitions ","title":"Mathlete"},{"id":"1422484","text":"Henry William Banks Davis (1833–1914) was a popular English landscape and animal painter, noted for his pastoral scenes, often populated with cattle and other farm animals. ==Life and works== He studied and exhibited at the Royal Academy, becoming an associate in 1873 and Royal Academician in 1877, and where he was awarded two silver medals.

He has composed and performed music for dance performances and film soundtracks. ==Life and career== John Surman at the 2017 Oslo Jazz Festival Surman was born in Tavistock, Devon. He initially gained recognition playing baritone saxophone in the Mike Westbrook Band in the mid-1960s, and was soon heard regularly playing soprano saxophone and bass clarinet as well. His first playing issued on a record was with the Peter Lemer Quintet in 1966. After further recordings and performances with jazz bandleaders Mike Westbrook and Graham Collier and blues-rock musician Alexis Korner, he made the first record under his own name in 1968. In 1969 he founded the well-regarded and influential group The Trio along with two expatriate American musicians, bassist Barre Phillips and drummer Stu Martin. In the mid-1970s he founded one of the earliest all-saxophone jazz groups, S.O.S., along with alto saxophonist Mike Osborne and tenor saxophonist Alan Skidmore. During this early period he also recorded with (among others) saxophonist Ronnie Scott, guitarist John McLaughlin, bandleader Michael Gibbs, trombonist Albert Mangelsdorff, and pianist Chris McGregor's Brotherhood of Breath.Cotterrell, Roger. ‘John Surman: Perpetual Motion’ Jazz Forum 76 (March 1982), 25-29. By 1972 he had begun experimenting with synthesizers. That year he recorded Westering Home, the first of several solo projects on which he played all parts himself via overdubbing. He recorded his final album with Mike Westbrook, Citadel/Room 315 in 1975. Many of the musical relationships he established during the 1970s have continued to the present. These include a quartet with pianist John Taylor, bassist Chris Laurence, and drummer John Marshall; duets and other projects with Norwegian singer Karin Krog; and duets and other projects with American drummer/pianist Jack DeJohnette. His relationship with ECM Records has also been continuous from the late 1970s to the present, as Surman has recorded prolifically for the label playing bass clarinet, recorders, soprano and baritone saxophones and using synthesisers, both solo and with a wide range of other musicians. In recent years he has composed several suites of music that feature his playing in unusual contexts, including with church organ and chorus (Proverbs and Songs, 1996); with a classical string quintet (Coruscating); and with the London Brass and Jack DeJohnette (Free and Equal, 2001). He has also played in a unique trio with Tunisian oud-player Anouar Brahem and bassist Dave Holland (Thimar, 1997); has performed the songs of John Dowland with singer John Potter formerly of the Hilliard Ensemble; and made contributions to the drum and bass album Disappeared by Spring Heel Jack. Other musicians he has worked with include bassist Miroslav Vitous, bandleader Gil Evans, pianist Paul Bley and Vigleik Storaas, saxophonist (and composer) John Warren, guitarists Terje Rypdal and John Abercrombie and trumpeter Tomasz Stańko. == Awards and honors == * 1999: Spellemannprisen in the category Jazz, with Karin Krog for the album Bluesand * 2013: Spellemannprisen in the category Jazz, with Karin Krog for the album Songs About This and That == Discography == === As leader === * John Surman (Deram, 1969) * How Many Clouds Can You See?

Construction began in 1535 and completed in 1649. It is dedicated to St John, Apostle and Evangelist. ==Description== The nave of the Cathedral. Main facade Portada del Perdón Lima Cathedral, by night Francisco Pizarro's tomb In keeping with the majority of cathedrals the front facade has three large doorways. The main or central gateway is called the Portada del Perdón or the \\"door of forgiveness\\". Above the doorway is the Peruvian seal and the phrase \\"Plus Ultra\\" rather than Lima's coat-of-arms. The two high towers with spire of slate, are neoclassical with stylistic influences of the school \\"El Escorial\\" and of northern Europe. There are 14 side chapels, one of which opens on to Calle de Judíos (Street of the Jews) and another on to the Patio de los Naranjos (Square of the Orange Trees, connected to the Cathedral). At the rear are two more entrances: Santa Apolonia and San Cristóbal. Set on the front facade are sculptures of the Apostles and in the middle, the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Adjoining the Cathedral are the Parroquia del Sagrario (one of the oldest ones in Lima) and the Archbishop's Palace. Inside, along the side aisles, are a sequence of large paintings of the Via Crucis, \\"Way of the Cross.\\" Pope John Paul II visited this cathedral on two occasions, in 1985 and 1988. This is commemorated with signs at the entrance. In the left aisle, the first chapel holds the ancient baptistery. Here can be seen a beautiful image of Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza, who presides over the events during Cuaresm and Holy Week. During a recent restoration, ancient pictures were found in this chapel that have been restored and are displayed again for the public. The next chapel is Capilla de la Sagrada Familia (chapel of the Holy Family), featuring figures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph. The Basilica Cathedral of Lima is also home to the tomb of Francisco Pizarro ==Timeline== St. Matthew on the front facade The following chronological data is based on the work of the priest and art historian Antonio San Cristóbal.

The large gap overlooked by the two wooden terraces pictured is the breach that caused the Johnstown Flood. An 1889 stereoscope view of the dam after the flood. The South Fork Dam was an earthenwork dam forming Lake Conemaugh (formerly Western Reservoir, also known as the Old Reservoir and Three Mile Dam, a misnomer),\\"Sailboats on the mountain\\", The Johnstown Flood, by David McCullough; Simon & Schuster; New York, NY, USA; p. 25. Retrieved June 11, 2019. an artificial body of water near South Fork, Pennsylvania, United States. On May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam failed catastrophically and 20 million tons of water from Lake Conemaugh burst through and raced 14 miles (23 km) downstream, causing the Johnstown Flood. The South Fork Dam was originally built between 1838–1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of the canal system to be used as a reservoir for the state's Main Line of Public Works canal basin in Johnstown. It was abandoned by the commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests. The dam was 72 feet (22 m) high and 931 feet (284 m) long. Between 1881 when the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprung leaks. It was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner had removed and sold for scrap the three cast iron discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Before the flood, speculators had bought the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Members of this exclusive and secretive retreat in the mountains were 61 wealthy Pittsburgh steel and coal financiers and industrialists, including Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, Philander Knox, John George Alexander Leishman, and Henry Clay Frick. Daniel Johnson Morrell, of the Cambria Iron Works of Johnstown, also became a member, ostensibly to monitor the condition of the dam. ==Lake Conemaugh== ===Dam Failure=== On May 31, 1889, after several days of unprecedented rainfall, the dam gave way. A torrent of water raced downstream, destroying several towns. When it reached Johnstown, 2,209 people were killed, and there was $17 million in damage. This was the first major disaster relief effort handled by the new American Red Cross, led by Clara Barton. After the flood, victims suffered a series of legal defeats in their attempt to recover damages from the dam's owners. Public indignation at that failure prompted a major development in American law: state courts' move from a fault-based regime to strict liability. The Johnstown Flood became a symbol of the power and potential destructive force of the elements. Part of the St. Michael neighborhood, and most of Creslo, of the town St. Michael-Sidman, Pennsylvania now sits on the bed of the former Lake Conemaugh. ==See also== *Kelly Barnes Dam ==External links== *Johnstown flood museum ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Cambria County, Pennsylvania Category:Dams in Pennsylvania Category:Disasters in Pennsylvania Category:Dam failures in the United States Category:1889 disasters ","title":"South Fork Dam"},{"id":"1422508","text":"An APL intelligence report sent to the U.S. government detailing pro-German statements The American Protective League (1917-1919) was an organization of private citizens that worked with Federal law enforcement agencies during the World War I era to identify suspected German sympathizers and to counteract the activities of radicals, anarchists, anti-war activists, and left-wing labor and political organizations. At its zenith, the APL claimed 250,000 members in 600 cities. ==Organizational history== ===Founding=== The APL was formed in 1917 by A. M. Briggs, a wealthy Chicago advertising executive. Briggs believed the United States Department of Justice was severely understaffed in the field of counterintelligence in the new wartime environment, so he proposed a new volunteer auxiliary, with participants to be neither paid nor to benefit from expense accounts.World's Work, 395 Briggs was given authority to proceed with his plan by the Department of Justice on March 22, 1917, and the American Protective League (APL) was born. Although technically a private organization, the APL nevertheless was the beneficiary of semi-official status. The group received the formal approval from Attorney General Thomas Gregory, who authorized the APL to carry on its letterhead the words \\"Organized with the Approval and Operating under the Direction of the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Investigation.\\" Under this directive, the APL worked with the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) — precursor to the FBI — which gathered information for U.S. District Attorneys. APL assistance was welcomed by the BOI, which in 1915 had only 219 field agents, without direct statutory authorization to carry weapons or to make general arrests.Glen L. Roberts, \\"APL and the BOI,\\" Full Disclosure Magazine. Thus the author of a letter to the New York Times claimed membership in the APL and described it as \\"a volunteer unpaid auxiliary of the Department of Justice\\" in which he and his colleagues \\"have been acting upon cases assigned by the Department of Justice, Military Intelligence, State Department, Civil Service, Provost Marshal General, etc.\\"New York Times: \\"An Error of Omission,\\" December 7, 1918, accessed March 17, 2010 APL members sometimes wore badges suggesting a quasi-official status: \\"American Protective League –Secret Service.\\" The Attorney General boasted of the manpower they provided: \\"I have today several hundred thousand private citizens... assisting the heavily overworked Federal authorities in keeping an eye on disloyal individuals and making reports of disloyal utterances.\\"Kennedy, 82 In a letter to Briggs, the Justice Department told the APL that it was not only \\"of great importance prior to our entering the war, it became of vastly greater importance after that step had been taken.\\" The government had been receiving complaints of disloyalty and enemy activities, and while the Bureau of Investigation was doing its best to contain the situation, the letter continued, the Protective League served as an auxiliary force to put a stop to corruption within the borders of the United States.Biltmore Industries Achieves: T. W. Gregory \\"Office of the Attorney General,\\" letter to Mr. A. M. Briggs, November 16, 1917. American Protective League , accessed February 4, 2009 ===Membership and structure=== An American Protective League membership card At its zenith, the American Protective League claimed 250,000 dues-paying members in 600 cities.Linfield, 38 It was claimed that 52 million Americans — approximately half of the country's population — lived in communities in which the APL maintained an active presence. The national headquarters of the APL was established in Washington, D.C., with Briggs installed as the Chairman of the governing National Board of Directors.World's Work, 394 Charles Daniel Frey, of Chicago, served as the national director of the American Protective League. From Charles Daniel Frey Papers, ca. 1917-1919 In addition to its regular geographically-based network, the APL attempted to organize secret units inside factories producing clothing and war materiel, with a view to identification of those advancing \\"discouraging disloyalty\\" or engaging in pro-German activities.World's Work, 396 Suspects would be reported within the APL organization, which would then make use of its broader network in the community to investigate the activities of these individuals after working hours, if deemed so necessary.World's Work, 396-397 ===Activities=== Teams of APL members conducted numerous raids and surveillance activities aimed at those who failed to register for the draft and at German immigrants who were suspected of sympathies for Germany.Hagedorn, 27-8 APL headquarters and the Justice Department in Washington often lost control over field operations, to the point that U.S. Attorneys and BOI agents, assisted by cadres of volunteers from the APL and other similar patriotic auxiliaries, pursued suspects of disloyalty on their own initiative and in their own manner. APL members \\"spotted violators of food and gasoline regulations, rounded up draft evaders in New York, disrupted Socialist meetings in Cleveland, broke strikes, [and] threatened union men with immediate induction into the army.\\"Odysseus Group: John Taylor Gatto, \\"The American Protective League\\" , accessed March 16, 2010; Hagedorn, 30 In the most extraordinary cooperative action, thousands of APL members joined authorities in New York City for three days of checking registration cards. This resulted in more than 75,000 arrests, though fewer than 400 of those arrested were shown to be guilty of anything more than failing to carry their cards.Ackerman, 19-20; New York Times: \\"Get 1,500 Slackers in 3-Day Roundup,\\" September 6, 1918, accessed March 17, 2010 APL agents, many of them female, worked undercover in factories and attended union meetings in hope of uncovering saboteurs and other enemies of the war effort.Hagedorn, 27, 324 APL members were accused of acting as vigilantes, allegedly violating the civil liberties of American citizens, including so- called \\"anti-slacker raids\\" designed to round up men who had not registered for the draft. The APL was also accused of illegally detaining citizens associated with anarchist, labor, and pacifist movements.Kennedy, 82-3, 165-6 An APL report on its actions in the Northwest for five months in 1918 showed that among its 25 activities, its largest effort (some 10% of its activity), was in disrupting the IWW. Some IWW members had been involved in violent labor disputes and bomb plots against U.S. businessmen and government officials. In turn, the IWW alleged that APL members burgled and vandalized IWW offices and harassed IWW members. ===Criticism=== During World War I, the APL was joined by many similar \\"secret societies\\" and groups formed by civilians to fight against foreign infiltration and sabotage. The \\"Anti Yellow Dog League\\" was a similar organization composed of school boys over the age of ten, who sought out disloyal persons. Such leagues and societies branched across the nation.Higham, page? President Woodrow Wilson knew of the APL's activities and had misgivings about their methods. He wrote to Attorney General Gregory expressing his concern: \\"It would be dangerous to have such an organization operating in the United States, and I wonder if there is any way in which we could stop it?\\" Kennedy, 83, 87-8; Hagedorn, 28 But he deferred to Gregory's judgment and took no action to curtail the APL. The APL also worked with the army's Military Intelligence Division (MID), the government's principal investigatory agency in this period.Hagedorn, 25-6 When the relationship between the APL and the MID became public early in 1919, the revelations embarrassed Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Baker tried to end the War Department's use of volunteer spies.Hagedorn, 58-59 ===Disbandment=== After the Armistice with Germany ended the war, Attorney General Gregory credited the APL with the defeat of German spies and propaganda. He claimed that his Department still required the APL's services as enemy nations sought to weaken American resolve during the peace negotiations, especially as newly democratic Germany sought kindlier treatment than its predecessor government might have expected.New York Times: \\"German Intrigue is Still Kept Up,\\" November 22, 1918, accessed March 17, 2010; New York Times: \\"Topics of the Times: Peace Does Not Change their Minds,\\" November 23, 1918 A. Mitchell Palmer succeeded Gregory as Attorney General on 5 March 1919. Before assuming office, he had opposed the APL activities. One of Palmer's first acts was to release 10,000 aliens of German ancestry who had been taken into government custody during the war. He stopped accepting intelligence gathered by the APL.Coben, 199 He also refused to share information in his APL-provided files when Ohio Governor James M. Cox requested it. He called the APL materials \\"gossip, hearsay information, conclusions, and inferences\\" and added that \\"information of this character could not be used without danger of doing serious wrong to individuals who were probably innocent.\\"Pietruszka, 193 In March 1919, when some in Congress and the press were urging him to reinstate the Justice Department's wartime relationship with the APL, he told reporters that \\"its operation in any community constitutes a grave menace.\\"Hagedorn, 186-7, 227; Coben, 199-200 A few months after the Armistice, the League officially disbanded, even as its members insisted they could serve as they had earlier in wartime against America's post-war enemies, \\"these bomb fiends, Bolsheviki, IWW's and other fiends.\\"Hagedorn, 186-7 The publication of the organization's story as The Web: A Revelation of Patriotism was an attempt to revive its fortunes as well. That volume by Emerson Hough, an author of Western novels, called for a program of \\"selective immigration, deportation of un-Americans, and denaturalization of 'disloyal' citizens and anarchists.\\" It said: \\"We must purify the source of America's population and keep it pure.\\"Hagedorn, 226-7; Emerson Hough, The Web: A Revelation of Patriotism (Chicago: Reilly & Lee, 1919). For a review of The Web, see New York Times: \\"What America Did,\\" June 29, 1919, accessed March 17, 2010 On June 3, 1919, the Washington Post called for the revival of the APL to fight anarchists.Hagedorn, 230 The APL survived as a series of local organizations under other names, such as the Patriotic American League (Chicago) and the Loyalty League (Cleveland).Hagedorn, 431; see also 231 for Minneapolis activity. New Jersey members served as investigators for New York's Lusk Committee investigation of radicals and political dissenters.Hagedorn, 152-3 APL members continued to provide information and manpower to the Department of Justice, notably during the Palmer raids of January 1920. In the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan recruited members from the Southern branches of the APL.Hagedorn, 421-2, 431; Coben, 228. It is not clear that Palmer knew the role played by APL members in the raids. For years following the war, J. Edgar Hoover's General Intelligence Unit in the Justice Department drew on the APL for information about radicals.Hagedorn, 332 ==See also== *Alexander Mitchell Palmer *National Security League *American Defense Society *Ralph Van Deman ==Notes== ==References== * Ackerman, Kenneth D.

He was the driving force behind the abolition of slavery in Maryland in 1864.Wagandt, Charles Lewis, The Mighty Revolution: Negro Emancipation in Maryland, 1862-1864 (The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1964) ==Early life and career== Born in Annapolis, Maryland, his father, the Reverend Henry Lyon Davis (1775–1836), was a prominent Maryland Episcopal clergyman and was for some years president of St John's College at Annapolis. The son graduated at Kenyon College at Gambier, Ohio in 1837, and from the law department of the University of Virginia in 1841, and began the practice of law in Alexandria, Virginia, but in 1850 removed to Baltimore, Maryland, where he won a high position at the bar. Davis was a man of scholarly tastes, an orator of unusual ability and great eloquence, tireless and fearless in fighting political battles, but impulsive to the verge of rashness, impractical, tactless and autocratic. He wrote an elaborate political work entitled The War of Ormuzd and Ahriman in the Nineteenth Century (1853), in which he described the American Republic and the Russian Empire as the ultimate opponents in the struggles of humanity; it also dismissed the Southern contention that slavery was a divine institution. ==Career in Congress== Henry Winter Davis Early becoming imbued with strong anti-slavery views, though by inheritance he was himself a slaveholder, he began political life as a Whig. After the Whig Party disintegrated, he became a Know Nothing, and served as a member of the Know Nothing–influenced American Party in the House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861. By his independent course in Congress he won the respect and esteem of all political groups. In the contest over the speakership at the opening of the 36th United States Congress in 1859 he voted with the Republicans, incurring a vote of censure from the Maryland Legislature, which called upon him to resign. In the 1860 presidential election, not yet ready to become a Republican, he declined to be a candidate for the Republican nomination for Vice President of the United States, instead supported the Constitutional Union ticket of John Bell and Edward Everett. Defeated that year for reelection to Congress, in the winter of 1860 and 1861―between the secession of some Southern states and the beginning of the Civil War with the assault on Fort Sumter―Davis was involved in compromise measures. After Abraham Lincoln was elected and the Civil War began, Davis became a Republican. He was re- elected in 1862 to the U.S. House of Representatives and quickly became an aggressive Radical Republican, which was viewed as particularly surprising given that Maryland was a slaveholding border state. From December 1863 to March 1865 Davis served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1864, unwilling to leave the delicate questions concerning the French intervention in Mexico entirely in the hands of President Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward, Davis brought in a report very hostile to France, which was adopted by the House but not by the Senate. With other Radical Republicans, Davis was a bitter opponent of Lincoln's plan for the Reconstruction of the Southern states, which he thought too lenient. Oration on the life and character of Henry Winter Davis book of 1866 On February 15, 1864, he reported from committee a bill placing the process of Reconstruction under the control of Congress, and stipulating that the Confederate states, as a condition of being re-admitted to the Union would disfranchise all important civil and military officers of the Confederacy, abolish slavery, and repudiate all debts incurred by or with the sanction of the Confederate government. In his speech supporting this measure, Davis declared that until Congress should recognize a government established under its auspices, there is no government in the rebel states save the authority of Congress. The bill, the first formal expression by Congress with regard to Reconstruction, did not pass both Houses until the closing hours of the session. President Lincoln disapproved and on July 8 issued a proclamation defining his position. Soon afterward, on August 5, 1864, Davis joined Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio, who had piloted the bill through the Senate, in issuing the so-called Wade–Davis Manifesto, which violently denounced President Lincoln for encroaching on the domain of Congress and insinuated that the presidential policy would leave slavery unimpaired in the reconstructed states. In a debate in Congress some months later he declared, \\"When I came into Congress ten years ago this was a government of law. I have lived to see it a government of personal will.\\" He was one of the radical leaders who preferred John C. Frémont to Lincoln in the 1864 election, but subsequently withdrew his opposition and supported the President for re-election. Joining the Unconditional Union Party, he early favored the enlistment of negroes, and in July 1865 publicly advocated the extension of the suffrage to them. He was not a candidate for re-election to Congress in 1864. On Election Night, 1864, during a discussion, Lincoln said: \\"It has seemed to me recently that Winter Davis was growing more sensible to his own true interests and has ceased wasting his time by attacking me. I hope for his own good he has. He has been very malicious against me but has only injured himself by it. His conduct has been very strange to me. I came here, his friend, wishing to continue so. I had heard nothing but good of him; he was the cousin of my intimate friend Judge Davis. But he had scarcely been elected when I began to learn of his attacking me on all possible occasions.\\"Paul M. Angle (1947), ed., The Lincoln Reader, 1955 reprint, New York: Pocket Books, Ch. 22, \\"The Second Election\\", p. 529; John Hay's diary, November 8. Davis died in Baltimore at the very end of 1865. His remains were interred in Greenmount Cemetery. Henry W. Davis was a cousin of David Davis, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and later a U.S. Senator from Illinois. He was also a first cousin of Brevet Brigadier General Moses B. Walker who served as an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court. ==See also== * Anna Ella Carroll * James Morrison Harris * Thomas Holliday Hicks * Henry William Hoffman * Anthony Kennedy * John Pendleton Kennedy * Cornelius Leary * Plug Uglies * James Barroll Ricaud * Rip Raps * Edwin Hanson Webster ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *The Speeches of Henry Winter Davis (New York, 1867), to which is prefixed an oration on his life and character delivered in the House of Representatives by Senator John A.

Born in England in 1847, Anstey was educated at Rugby from 1863 to 1865. In 1877, he was living in Earl's Court, Kensington, Middlesex and working as a civil engineer; that year he married Edith Euphemia Carnegie. Anstey arrived in Western Australia on the in June 1887, and set up a metallurgical laboratory in Perth. Shortly afterwards, Anstey was invited to join the prospectors Richard Greaves and Edward Payne in a prospecting expedition to Bindoon. Soon after their return, news reached Perth that a Yilgarn station owner had found a nugget while sinking a well. In response to this news, a prospecting syndicate was formed, and the party was sent to the Yilgarn, with Anstey in command. On about 20 October the party discovered a reef in the Yilgarn Ranges at Ennuin, northwest of the current town of Southern Cross. The discovery prompted the gold rush that established Southern Cross and the Yilgarn Goldfield, and led to the subsequent rich finds at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie that established the Eastern Goldfields. After returning to Perth, Anstey was appointed Government Assayer in 1889. In 1890 he was living in the Cockburn Sound area, and from 1893 he was a farmer at Jarrahdale. From 22 August 1893 until July 1894, Anstey was a nominated member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. On 16 July 1894, he contested the Legislative Council seat of South West Province but was unsuccessful. In subsequent years he speculated in real estate in Claremont and Bassendean, but in 1898 financial difficulties prompted him to sell his properties and move to Cardup, where he became an orchardist. In 1899, Anstey returned to England. Some time in the early 1910s he moved to Camberley, Surrey. After his wife died in 1926, he retired to Falmouth. He died on 6 July 1927 in a private nursing home in London. == References== ;Sources * * . Republished in 1981 by Victoria Park, Western Australia: Hesperian Press. .

He was the eldest surviving son of Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, who died when Bernard was only nine years old. His mother was Gwendoline Herries, 12th Lady Herries of Terregles, and he inherited her peerage when she died in 1945. He was educated at the Oratory School and was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards in 1931, but resigned his commission in 1933. He joined the 4th (Territorial Army) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment in 1934, and was promoted Major in 1939. He served briefly in the Second World War, during which he was wounded in action. He subsequently served as Agricultural Secretary in Winston Churchill's Cabinet from February 1940 until June 1945. As hereditary Earl Marshal, he organised the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the funeral of Winston Churchill, and the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. He was a keen cricket fan and was the manager of the English cricket team in Australia in 1962–63, which excited much press interest. ==Personal life== The duke married the Hon Lavinia Mary Strutt, daughter of Algernon Strutt, 3rd Baron Belper and his wife Eva, on 27 January 1937. They had four daughters, three granddaughters and two great-grandchildren: * Lady Anne Elizabeth Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Lady Herries of Terregles, Baroness Cowdrey of Tonbridge (12 June 1938 – 23 November 2014); she married Colin Cowdrey, Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge in 1985. * Lady Mary Katharine Fitzalan- Howard, 15th Lady Herries of Terregles, DCVO (14 August 1940 – 7 April 2017); she married G/Capt. Anthony Mumford in 1986. * Lady Sarah Margaret Fitzalan- Howard (23 June 1941 – 14 June 2015) she married Nigel Clutton on 25 March 1988 * Lady (Theresa) Jane Fitzalan-Howard, Marchioness of Lothian, 16th Lady Herries of Terregles (24 June 1945) she married Michael Andrew Foster Jude Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian 7 June 1975. They have three daughters and two grandchildren. The 16th duke died on 31 January 1975, and is buried at Fitzalan Chapel on the western grounds of Arundel Castle. ==Cricket== The announcement that the Duke would manage the MCC cricket team in Australia in 1962–63 came as a complete surprise. He was a keen cricketer, who was President of the MCC in 1956–57 and was still a member of its powerful committee. He had managed his own tour of the West Indies with a Duke of Norfolk's XI in 1956–67, which had included the England players Tom Graveney, John Warr, Doug Wright and Willie Watson, and would organise another in 1969–70. His father, the 15th Duke, had built the picturesque Arundel Castle Cricket Ground and the Duke hosted matches against touring teams there from 1954, a tradition continued by his widow, Lavinia.R.L. Arrowsmith, The Barclays World of Cricket, Collins, pp. 216–17 (1986). He was not a good cricketer, even at village green level, and it was customary to let him get off the mark before he returned to the pavilion. At Arundel the umpire was his own butler, who when he was out would diplomatically announce \\"His Grace is not in\\".Dickie Bird, White Cap and Bails, Adventures of a Much Travelled Umpire, Hodder & Stoughton, pp. 259–60 (1999). The Duke was chosen after a chance remark while having drinks after a MCC Committee meeting. Billy Griffith was the prime candidate to manage the tour, but he had just been appointed the Secretary of the MCC and needed to remain at Lord's to oversee the change from the old divisions between amateurs and professionals that had been decided that autumn. The Duke offered his services when it was mentioned that the new captain Ted Dexter would be difficult to control. Player's cigarettes featuring Earl Marshal in coronation dress. Like Dexter, the Duke was a keen follower of horse-racing, and as President of Sussex County Cricket Club he was often at Hove and Arundel and had appointed Dexter county captain. When his appointment was announced it was joked that only a duke could manage \\"Lord Ted\\".E.W. Swanton, Swanton in Australia, with MCC 1946–1975, Fontana, pp 118–19 (1977). In those days the MCC tour was seen as a social event and the team were scheduled to attend many high society events for which the Duke was well suited. His relationship with Fred Trueman was mixed; he first spoke to him at the Second Test by calling \\"Trueman! Over here!\\" and beckoning him with his finger, to which the fast bowler took exception, but they later became good friends.Fred Trueman, As It Was, The Memoirs of Fred Trueman, Pan Books, pp 2–3, 286 (2004). Socially, the Duke was a great success, his transparent enjoyment of the game and affability with the players, press and public making him popular.Alban George Moyes, With the M.C.C. in Australia 1962–63, A Critical Story of the Tour, The Sportsmans Book Club, pp xiv–xv, p. 165 (1965).E.W.

As Earl Marshal of England, while in Australia he prepared the Queen's 1963 Royal Visit. He had to return to Great Britain for reasons of state for a month during the tour, which allowed Griffith to fly out and take over in his absence, this gaining useful experience of touring Australia. ==Dukedom of Norfolk and Earl Marshal== As Duke of Norfolk, he was Earl Marshal and Hereditary Marshal of England. In that capacity, the Duke had helped to organise various state ceremonies such as the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He also helped to organise the state funerals of King George VI in 1952 and of Winston Churchill in 1965. In 1969, he also took part in the planning for the investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales. On his death, the dukedom passed to his second cousin once removed Miles Stapleton-Fitzalan- Howard, 12th Baron Beaumont, 4th Baron Howard of Glossop. The Lordship of Herries of Terregles, being an old Scottish peerage, was inherited by his eldest daughter, Anne (14th Lady Herries of Terregles, Baroness Cowdrey of Tonbridge), who had married English cricketer Colin Cowdrey. ==Titles and honours== Garter-encircled shield of arms of Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel. ===Titles=== *Earl of Arundel (1908–1917) *His Grace The Duke of Norfolk (1917–1975) ===Honours=== *Knight of The Most Noble Order of The Garter (1937) *Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (1946) *Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (1968) *Territorial Decoration (1969) *Privy Council of the United Kingdom (1936) *Lord Lieutenant of Sussex (1949–1974) *Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex (1945) *Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex (1974–1975) ==See also== *Dukes of Norfolk family tree *Re Duke of Norfolk's Settlement Trusts [1982] Ch 61, a case concerning the payment of the trustees of the 16th Duke's family trust ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1975 deaths *24 Category:British Army personnel of World War II 316 Category:Earls Marshal *34 123 306 Category:English Roman Catholics Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Lord-Lieutenants of Sussex Category:Lord-Lieutenants of West Sussex Category:Lords Herries of Terregles Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Churchill caretaker government, 1945 Category:Ministers in the Churchill wartime government, 1940–1945 Category:People educated at The Oratory School Category:Presidents of the Marylebone Cricket Club Category:Recipients of the Royal Victorian Chain Category:Royal Horse Guards officers Category:Royal Sussex Regiment officers ","title":"Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk"},{"id":"1422524","text":"The word lunula means little moon and may also refer to: * Lunula (amulet), a Roman amulet worn by girls, the equivalent of the bulla worn by boys * Lunula (anatomy), the pale half-moon shape at the base of a fingernail * Lunule (bivalve), a crescent-moon shaped area on the shells of some marine bivalves * Two round brackets and the text between them * Gold lunula, a specific kind of archaeological solid collar or necklace from the Bronze Age or later * The openings in the test of a sand dollar * Calophasia lunula, a species of moth * Chaetodon lunula, a species of butterflyfish ==See also== * Lunette (disambiguation) * Lune (disambiguation) ","title":"Lunula"},{"id":"1422530","text":"Affing is a municipality near (10 km) Augsburg in Aichach-Friedberg district, in Swabia - Bavaria, southern Germany.

Having completed his education at the College de Sainte Barbe in Paris, he entered his father's business, but devoted his leisure hours to chemical and electrical researches, and between 1836 and 1848 published several papers on these subjects. In 1840, he enclosed a platinum coil in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it, thus creating one of the world's first electric light bulbs.In many years of studying primary sources relating to Warren De La Rue I have never found any which make this claim. De La Rue himself seems never to have referred to it, and it appears to be erroneous.The only reference of relevance is an 1855 comment by him that he proposed to use a platinum wire ignited by a voltaic battery as a guiding light for an aerial telescope (Royal Society MM11, 27, p11; and Le Conte, David (2011): Warren De La Rue, Pioneer Astronomical Photographer, in The Antiquarian Astronomer, Issue 5, p17.) The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although it was an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use. Attracted to astronomy by the influence of James Nasmyth, he constructed in 1850 a 13-inch reflecting telescope, mounted first at Canonbury, later at Cranford, Middlesex, and with its aid executed many drawings of the celestial bodies of singular beauty and fidelity. His chief title to fame, however, is his pioneering work in the application of the art of photography to astronomical research. In 1851 his attention was drawn to a daguerreotype of the moon by G. P. Bond, shown at the great exhibition of that year. Excited to emulate and employ the more rapid wet-collodion process, he succeeded before long in obtaining exquisitely defined lunar pictures, which remained unsurpassed until the appearance of the Lewis Morris Rutherfurd photographs in 1865. In 1854 he turned his attention to solar physics, and for the purpose of obtaining a daily photographic representation of the state of the solar surface he devised the photoheliograph, described in his report to the British Association, On Celestial Photography in England (1859), and in his Bakerian Lecture (Phil. Trans. vol. clii. pp. 333–416). Regular work with this instrument, inaugurated at Kew by De La Rue in 1858, was carried on there for fourteen years; and was continued at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from 1873 to 1882. The results obtained in the years 1862–1866 were discussed in two memoirs, entitled Researches on Solar Physics, published by De La Rue, in conjunction with Professor Balfour Stewart and Mr B Loewy, in the Phil. Trans. (vol. clix. pp. 1–110, and vol. clx. pp. 389–496). He took some of the very first photos of the moon, so he got a crater named after him the \\"De La Rue (crater)\\". In 1860 De La Rue took the photoheliograph to Spain for the purpose of photographing the total solar eclipse which occurred on 18 July of that year. This expedition formed the subject of the Bakerian Lecture already referred to. The photographs obtained on that occasion proved beyond doubt the solar character of the prominences or red flames, seen around the limb of the moon during a solar eclipse. In 1873 De La Rue gave up active work in astronomy, and presented most of his astronomical instruments to the university observatory, Oxford. Subsequently, in the year 1887, he provided the same observatory with a 13-inch refractor to enable it to take part in the International Photographic Survey of the Heavens. With Dr Hugo Müller as his collaborator he published several papers of a chemical character between the years 1856 and 1862, and investigated, 1868–1883, the discharge of electricity through gases by means of a battery of 14,600 chloride of silver cells. He was twice president of the Chemical Society, and also of the Royal Astronomical Society (1864–1866) and in 1862 received the gold medal of the latter society. In June 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in addition to their Bakerian Lecture in 1862 was awarded in 1864 their Royal Medal \\"for his observations on the 1860 total eclipse of the sun and his improvements in astronomical photography.\\" He died in London in 1889.

The highway travels through the southern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions, and is designated State Route 30 for most of its length. Outside of Perth the highway is predominately a sealed, single carriageway with regular overtaking lanes in some undulating areas. Albany Highway commences at The Causeway, a river crossing that connects to Perth's central business district. The highway heads south-east through Perth's metropolitan region, bypassed in part by Shepperton Road and Kenwick Link, and continues south-eastwards through to Albany. It intersects several major roads in Perth, including the Leach, Tonkin, Brookton, and South Western highways. The rural section of Albany Highway connects to important regional roads at the few towns and roadhouses along the route, including Coalfields Highway at Arthur River, Great Southern Highway at Cranbrook, and Muirs Highway at Mount Barker. Prior to European settlement, the indigenous Noongar people had a considerable network of tracks, including a trade route between the areas now known as Perth and Albany. Construction of a road between Perth and Albany began soon after the naming of Albany in 1832, but progress was slow, with only completed by 1833. A monthly mail route which operated in the 1840s had such trouble with the journey that a new contractor was required each year, and from 1847 the mail route detoured via Bunbury. The introduction of convicts in 1850, and thus convict labour, allowed a road along the direct route to be fully constructed by 1863. The rise of the motor vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain prominence once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth end of the road in the 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepperton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw Main Roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s Main Roads has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass. == Route description == Albany Highway commences at The Causeway, a river crossing that connects to Perth's central business district. The highway heads south-east through Perth's metropolitan region, and continues through the southern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions to Albany on the south coast of Western Australia. Albany Highway is generally a two-lane single carriageway road, but with additional lanes and dual-carriageway sections in Perth and Albany. The highway is allocated State Route 30, except for bypassed sections in Perth, and the southernmost portion in Albany. The part bypassed by Kenwick Link is allocated Alternate State Route 30, and a short length in Arthur River is concurrently allocated State Route 107\\\\. Albany Highway also carries sections of Heritage Country Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive 205) and Great Southern Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 356). Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state's road network, including various locations along Albany Highway. In the 2013/14 financial year, the recorded traffic volumes ranged between 3880 and 70,690 vehicles per weekday in Perth, 1980 to 3880 in the Wheatbelt, and 1720 to 5120 in the Great Southern. The highest percentage of heavy traffic was 29.2%, south of Jarrahdale Road in the Wheatbelt. Reports commissioned by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) in 2006 and 2008 gave the majority of the highway a three-star safety rating out of five, with an approximately section south-east of Armadale rated at a two star level. The overall highway network was generally rated as three-star or four- star, but around 10% in 2006 and 5% in 2008 received a two-star rating. ===Perth to Armadale=== In Perth, Albany Highway's north-western terminus is at a parclo interchange with The Causeway, Shepperton Road, and Great Eastern and Canning Highways in Victoria Park. The first of the road is one-way into the interchange, but only connecting to The Causeway and Canning Highway – there is no direct access to the other roads. For the next , the highway is a two-lane, two-way high street serving Victoria Park's town centre, and continuing south-east through East Victoria Park. The nearby four-lane Shepperton Road serves as a bypass, carrying through-traffic as well as State Route 30. Albany Highway as a dual carriageway in Cannington The two roads converge at an intersection with Welshpool Road, and for Albany Highway serves as an arterial route in Perth's south-eastern suburbs, varying between a single carriageway and dual carriageway, and between a four- and six-lane capacity. This part of the highway is dominated by commercial shopping precincts in Bentley, Cannington, Maddington, Gosnells and Kelmscott, with numerous sets of traffic lights. The section of Albany Highway through Beckenham and Kenwick is allocated Alternate State Route 30, while State Route 30 follows a bypass, Kenwick Link. Albany Highway has a folded diamond interchange with Tonkin Highway in Gosnells, and continues south for past commercial and residential properties in Kelmscott and Mount Nasura. The highway has a T junction that is the western terminus of Brookton Highway, at the boundary between Kelmscott, and Mount Nasura. Further south in Armadale, the highway intersects the eastern end of Armadale Road and northern end of South Western Highway. ===Regional highway=== Two-lane highway section near Mount Barker Albany Highway and South Coast Highway intersection outside Albany Albany Highway proceeds east and then south from Armadale, around the suburb of Mount Richon. The road continues south-east, with signs of human activity becoming more sparse as the highway crosses the Darling Scarp, and the scenery transitions to native forest. Further south, after , it transitions again to pastures, with farming activities such as livestock rearing and orchards. Over the next , the highway encounters few towns: Williams, Kojonup and Mount Barker are on the highway, but are apart. Roadhouses exist at North Bannister, Crossman and Arthur River, while many of the service towns in the region are approximately to the east on Great Southern Highway, including Narrogin, Wagin and Katanning. Closer to Albany, there are large tracts of blue gum eucalypt plantations. from the road's south-eastern terminus, it passes Albany Airport. The highway passes by suburban areas before intersecting South Coast Highway at a Y intersection, and only beyond it, a large five-way roundabout. This roundabout is the southern terminus of State Route 30, and connects the highway with Chester Pass Road (which continues east to South Coast Highway), North Road, and Hanrahan Road. The final stretch takes the highway south-east into the centre of Albany. ==History== ===Background=== Prior to European settlement, the indigenous Noongar people had a considerable network of tracks around their territory in the south-west of Western Australia. One such track, used as a trade route, linked the Swan River (in modern-day Perth) with the area now known as Albany. The track followed a similar alignment to modern-day Albany Highway. cited in On 25 December 1826, the New South Wales colonial government brig Amity, under the command of Major Edmund Lockyer, arrived at King George Sound to establish a military garrison. On 21 January 1827, as instructed by the Colonial Secretary, the Union Jack was raised and a feu de joie fired by the troops, formally annexing the territory, in assertion of the first official claim by the Imperial Government to British possession over the whole continent of Australia. On 7 March 1831 the King George Sound and colony was made part of the Swan River Colony and a free settlement. Albany was officially named by Governor Stirling at the beginning of 1832, at the time that political authority passed to the Swan River colony. The construction of a road from Albany to Perth began soon thereafter, but only had been completed by 1833. Due to this slow progress, the settlers of Albany petitioned England to supply convicts to work on the road. At the time the government in Perth derided the proposal, and Western Australia would not become a penal colony until 1849. ===Surveying and initial routes=== In October and November 1835, Governor Stirling and Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe travelled overland from Perth to Albany, with the focus of the journey being the route south of the Hotham River. A more comprehensive survey was undertaken in July–September 1836 by Assistant Surveyors Alfred Hillman and D. Smith. Hillman started from the Albany end, while Smith concurrently commenced from Perth. A few months later, in February 1837, Hillman accompanied a group that made the trip to Perth in 12 days travelling time, journeying via Chorkurup, Thokokup, Mount Barker, Lake Matilda, Kojonup, Williams and Arthur River. This group was led by Mr J. Harris, and included Lieutenant Armstrong with eight soldiers of the 21st Fusiliers, Albany settlers Patrick Taylor and Dr. Thomas Harrison, as well as Kartrull, who was referred to as \\"the native 'Handsome. The place where they arrived in Williams was right opposite the road from Kelmscott to Williams, Mr Harris describe Hillnman as please having previously survey the route from Perth to Kelmscott. In April 1838 four bridges were built near Albany by John Young, and in 1839 Governor John Hutt ventured out to Albany on an official visit, travelling through Williams and Kojonup. Assistant Surveyor Hillman led a large group of Albany settlers to Perth in 1840, via Kinunup, Yarenup, Joseph's Wells, Balgarrup and Mandalup; whilst in the same year Edward John Eyre shepherded 550 sheep and 70 cattle from Albany to York, and then over to Perth. A monthly mail route was set up in June 1841, travelling from Albany to Perth via Kojonup and Williams. The following year, a service through Guildford commenced. The tough conditions of the mail route saw a different contractor providing the service each year. The 1845 contractor James Martin had particular trouble with debts, which led to his mail horse being seized; while he managed to acquire a replacement animal, he also had trouble servicing the resultant debt of £2. In 1847, the Perth–Albany route was adjusted, so that the mail would travel from Albany to Kojonup, then head to Bunbury on the coast, and subsequently up to Perth via Rockingham and Fremantle. The new route still had difficulties, such as flooding in the winter of 1847 that resulted in a \\"terrible trip\\" which took a month to complete. The people of Albany, who could travel as passengers on the mail cart, found the trip to Perth long and deplorable. With the arrival of the convict ship Scindian on 1 June 1850 and the advent of convict labour, early completion of the Perth–Albany road seemed assured. Investigations of a direct route via Kelmscott, Hotham, Williams and Kojonup began in late 1851. Assistant Surveyor A. C. Gregory reported in 1852 that the direct route would be shorter than the route via Bunbury, and shorter than the York route. Construction was recommended in late 1852, after the mail contractor George Maxwell completed a journey along the proposed route in September, and soon commenced. had been completed by October 1853, and the whole road was finished in 1863. The road served as the main link between Perth and Albany until the 1880s, when the Great Southern Railway opened. ===Early 20th century=== The rise of the motor vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain prominence once more. The newly formed Main Roads Board took over control and maintenance of the Perth–Albany road and twenty-one other important roads between 1926 and 1928, which were declared \\"main roads\\". At this stage the Perth–Albany road was not much more developed than a bush track. To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the Board's work schedule prioritised upgrading the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. In 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the Perth–Albany road were improved, but many were short, and drivers would experience quite varied conditions, from new sealed road to gravel road, and then a boggy dirt in just a few miles. By 1932, the improved conditions allowed an average speed of to be reached, for a total trip of eight to nine hours instead of two days. In 1938, a total of had been sealed, and the following year the whole route had been completed. In 1935, a town planning report for the City of Perth noted traffic congestion on Albany Road in Victoria Park. As widening the existing road would have left the council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead. To provide the bypasses, parallel roads would be upgraded and extended: Berwick Street to the south-west, and Shepperton Road to the north- east. In 1937, work had progressed on extending Berwick Street eastwards, and it had been extended to Alday Street by November 1938. A new causeway to extend Berwick Street north over the Swan River, and make it a truck route, was considered by the state government in 1940. The existing Causeway, from which Albany Road commenced, had experienced almost a doubling of traffic volume between 1930 and 1939. However, the new Causeway was eventually constructed adjacent to old Causeway, which was then demolished. The cooperation of the Canning Road District would be required to continue the Berwick Street bypass south-east beyond the city's boundary at Boundary Road, and ultimately through to Albany Road. The South Perth Road Board was also in favour of such a bypass, which would improve access for South Perth residents. A deputation from the Canning and South Perth Road Boards to the Acting Minister For Works, Mr E. H. Gray, in June 1940 complained about the congestion in Albany Road. The traffic delays were worsened by cars parked on both sides of the road and slow-moving trams. The deputation suggested extending Berwick Street to Albany Highway as the solution, as well as removing the trams. Gray contended that parking should be prohibited, and refused to scrap the trams, but said he would consider the resumption of land east of Berwick Street to enable a extension to Albany Road. However, Berwick Street was diverted to the south-west to connect with Chapman Road, providing a longer continuous route west of Albany Highway. Shepperton Road ran parallel to Albany Road between Harvey Street, from The Causeway, and Somerset Street, further along. In 1937, a road from Asquith Street to Albany Road was constructed, to eventually link in with Shepperton Road. In the same year, the intersection of Albany Road, Milford Street, and Welshpool Road was reconfigured to improve visibility, and in anticipation of an eastern extension to Shepperton Road. In April 1940, that extension was nearing completion, which was expected to be by the end of May, while the demolition of houses on land resumed for the western extension was being arranged. On 29 September 1941, the Perth City Council decided to construct the link between Asquith Street and Harvey Street early the following year, completing the Shepperton Road bypass. Buses were rerouted onto Shepperton Road in 1946, by which time it had become the preferred route for motorists. In November 1939, the State Advisory Committee on Nomenclature recommended that the Perth–Albany road be named Great Southern Highway, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. This suggestion followed on from the naming of Great Eastern Highway, in April of the previous year. The committee sent letters to all the local governments in the area to advise them of the proposal. Feedback was mixed; whilst the name was \\"thoroughly approved\\" by the Tambellup Road Board, and the Perth City Council's general purposes committee recommended that no objection be raised, the Kojonup Road Board believed that \\"sufficient grounds [did] not exist for the proposed change\\", and the Albany Municipal Council objected strongly to not retaining \\"Perth–Albany\\" in the name. The State Advisory Committee made a new recommendation in April 1940 for Albany Highway instead of Great Southern Highway. This new proposal received support from the Albany Municipal Council and Tambellup Road Board. However, the Perth City Council still preferred Great Southern Highway, and recommended that within its boundaries – from The Causeway to Welshpool – the road be named Albany Road, and that one of the proposed bypasses in the area would be better suited to the highway name. The entire road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, superseding the previously used names Albany Road, Perth–Albany Road, and High Street in Kojonup. ===Post-World War II=== During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its activities on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was spurred on by the closure of railway lines in addition to the establishment of new land settlements. In Perth, a roundabout was constructed at the north-western end of Albany Highway, to improve the flow of traffic onto and off The Causeway. It opened in 1952, with guides on the usage of the roundabout published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began to upgrade the intersection to a partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of The Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974. Tunney By the late 1970s, the road sections sealed in the 1950s and 1960s were in need of repair or maintenance to prolong the pavement life. Old bitumen surfaces would deteriorate and crack. Resealing such cracks was a high priority, as expensive reconstruction would be required if water was allowed to enter the road base. Over a ten-year period, $49 million was spent on repairing Albany Highway. The techniques used in this process were then formalised into the 4R Program, which aimed to alleviate a growing maintenance problem – based on a thirty- five-year pavement lifespan, the amount of reconstruction required would be more than double the actual rate of reconstruction. \\"4R\\" abbreviated the options that could be used keep roads serviceable: *Restoration – maintaining the condition of a road *Resurfacing – resealing a bitumen surface which was no longer waterproof, to prevent pavement failure *Rehabilitation – improving a deteriorated road to its original condition *Reconstruction – done when deterioration was beyond the point of repairs Interventions to prevent a road requiring reconstruction, the most costly option, would save money. From the 1980s Main Roads began planning for the future needs of Albany Highway within the City of Canning in Perth, in conjunction with the City and the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority. A section between Leach Highway and Nicholson Road was subsequently upgraded between November 1992 and June 1994. The four-lane undivided road had been one of the most congested in Perth but was improved by adding a third lane in each direction as well as a median strip. The project was recognised with an Excellence Award from the Institution of Engineers Australia in 1994. In the 1990s several other improvement projects were planned across the length of the highway, including between Bedfordale and North Bannister, through Mount Barker, and between Narrikup and Albany. Closer to Perth, the section along Bedfordale Hill (south-east of Armadale) was upgraded to a four-lane dual carriageway, with work completed in June 1999. This period also saw the planning and construction of additional junctions with new major roads in Perth. At Armadale, Armadale Road would connect to what had been a three-way junction with South Western Highway, while a highway deviation was proposed to connect to the extension of Roe Highway through Beckenham. The proposed deviation became Kenwick Link, constructed as part of the Roe Highway extension towards Fremantle. It was initially built as a single carriageway, and upgraded to a dual carriageway later. It opened on 17 April 1998, ahead of the Roe Highway extensions from Welshpool Road to Kenwick Link (opened 30 November 2002) and from Kenwick Link to Nicholson Road (opened 21 January 2003). Further work was undertaken in Perth in 2011 and 2012, between John Street in Bentley and Leach Highway. The road was widened and a median installed to increase both safety and efficiency. The works also upgraded intersection, including installation of new traffic lights. Downer EDI Works Pty Ltd completed the work under a $3.65 million contract. In January 2014, work began on widening and reconstructing of Albany Highway north of Kojonup. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Western Australia ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Main Roads Western Australia * State Library of Western Australia Pictorial collection of historical Albany Highway photographs Category:Highways and freeways in Perth, Western Australia Category:Highways in rural Western Australia ","title":"Albany Highway"},{"id":"1422573","text":"Lookin' for Trouble is the 1980 debut album of Canadian rock band Toronto.

After Jan de Baen He associated himself closely with his younger brother, the Raadpensionaris of Holland (\\"Grand Pensionary\\") Johan de Witt, and supported him throughout his career with great ability and vigour. In 1667 he was the deputy chosen by the States of Holland to accompany Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter in his famous raid on the Medway. Cornelis de Witt on this occasion distinguished himself greatly by his coolness and intrepidity. He again accompanied De Ruyter in 1672 and took an honorable part in the great battle of Solebay against the united English and French fleets. Compelled by illness to leave the fleet, he found on his return to Dortrecht that the Orange party were in the ascendant, and he and his brother were the objects of popular suspicion and hatred. He was arrested on false accusations of treason, but did not confess despite heavy torture and was ultimately unlawfully condemned to be banished. He was assassinated by the same carefully organised lynch mob that killed his brother on the day he was to be released, victim of a conspiracy by the Orangists Johan Kievit and Lieutenant-Admiral Cornelis Tromp. Both their bodies were mutilated and their hearts were carved out to be exhibited as trophies. The scene was painted by Jan de Baen, the same painter who had twice painted his portrait, in The Corpses of the De Witt Brothers. Cornelis de Witt was married to Maria van Berckel (1632–1706). The couple had one daughter, Wilhelmina de Witt (1671–1702). She married her first cousin (the son of Johan de Witt) Johan de Witt Jr. (1662–1701), secretary of Dordrecht. ==In popular culture== Cornelis de Witt and his role in Dutch politics was depicted in the 2015 film Michiel de Ruyter.

November 2007, 61(5): 1091–6. Reil used the term 'psychiaterie' in a short-lived journal he set up with J.C. Hoffbauer, Beytrage zur Beforderung einer Curmethode auf psychischem Wege (1808: 169). He argued there should not just be a branch of medicine (psychische Medizin) or of theology or penal practice, but a discipline in its own right with trained practitioners. He also sought to publicize the plight of the insane in the asylums and to develop a 'psychical' method of treatment, consistent with the moral treatment movement of the times. He was critical of Frenchman Philippe Pinel, however. Reil was mainly theoretical, with little direct clinical experience, by contrast with Pinel. Reil is considered a writer within the German Romantic context, and his 1803 work Rhapsodien uber die Anwendung der psychischen Kurmethode auf Geisteszerrüttungen ('Rhapsodies about applying the psychological method of treatment to mental breakdowns') has been called the most important document of Romantic psychiatry. Reil didn't conceptualize madness as just a break from reason but as a reflection of wider social conditions, and believed that advances in civilization created more madness. He saw this as due not to physical lesions in the brain or to hereditary evil, but as a disturbance in the harmony of the mind's functions (forms of awareness or presence), rooted in the nervous system.Theodore Ziolkowski, German Romanticism and its Institutions. Princeton, N.J.:Princeton University Press, 1990, pp. 181–217. Reil also wrote on Blumenbach's idea of the Bildungstrieb (literally, \\"building power\\"), a vital force within each organism that compels it to create, maintain, and repair its form. In Reil's essay \\"Von der Lebenskraft,\\" he argued that each organism contained a \\"dormant germ\\" that was activated by the addition of the father's \\"animal force.\\"Watson, p. 83.

He was considered one of the most adept of Celtic kings, ruling the three tribes of Celtic Galatia from his fortress in Blucium. The name Deiotarus is generally translated as Galatian Celtic \\"Divine-bull\\" (*deiuo-tauros; cf. Old Irish dia, Welsh duw, Old Welsh duiu, \\"God\\" and Old Irish tarb, Welsh tarw \\"bull\\", with Western Celtic metathesis of the cluster -uro- to -ruo-).Xavier Delamarre (2003). Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise. Editions Errance, Paris, p. 142.Matasovic, Ranko, Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic, Brill, 2009, p. 371. ==Biography== Deiotarus was a faithful ally of the Romans and became involved in the struggles between the Roman generals that led to the fall of the Republic from 44 BC. He changed sides and supported the triumvirs, keeping his kingdom until his death. He is first heard of at the beginning of the Third Mithridatic War, when he drove out the troops of Mithridates VI of Pontus under Eumachus from Phrygia, and he was a witness where Mithridates VI saw his invasion of Phrygia stopped by the Roman ally, both in 75 BC or 74 BC. His most influential friend was Pompey, who, when settling the affairs of Asia after Mithridates VI failed in his invasion of Phrygia and was finally defeated by the Romans in 65 BC, 64 BC, 63 BC or 62 BC, rewarded him for his assistance against him with the title of King and an increase of territory (part of eastern Pontus, to which the Senate granted him Lesser Armenia and most of Galatia). On the outbreak of the civil war from 49 BC to 45 BC, Deiotarus naturally sided with his old patron and ally Pompey and the Optimates in their stand against Julius Caesar, who was defying the Senate, and after being defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC escaped with him to Asia. When Pompey was defeated he faced execution, but was saved in part due to the advocacy of Cicero between 49 BC and 45 BC. During this time, Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, had seized Lesser Armenia, and defeated Deiotarus' army near Nicopolis. Fortunately for Deiotarus, Julius Caesar at that time (47 BC) arrived in Asia from Egypt, and was met by the tetrarch in the dress of a suppliant. Caesar pardoned him for having sided with Pompey, ordered him to resume his royal attire, and hastened against Pharnaces, whom he defeated at Zela. In consequence of the complaints of certain Galatian princes, Deiotarus was deprived of part of his dominions in 47 BC, but was pardoned by Caesar and allowed to retain the title of King. On the death of Mithridates of Pergamum, Tetrarch of the Trocmi, Deiotarus was a candidate for the vacancy. Other tetrarchs also pressed their claims; and, further, Deiotarus was accused at Rome in 45 BC by his grandson Castor of having attempted to assassinate Caesar when the latter, then Dictator, was his guest in Galatia. Cicero, who entertained a high opinion of Deiotarus, whose acquaintance he had made when governor of Cilicia, undertook his defence, the case being heard in Caesar's own house at Rome. Cicero to Gaius Caesar: \\"... for it was king Deiotarus who raised your family, when abject and obscure, from darkness into light. Who ever heard of your father, or who he was, before they heard whose son-in-law he was?\\"\\"Speech in Behalf of King Deiotarus\\", by Marcus Tullius Cicero, translated by Charles Duke Yonge, A.B. The matter was allowed to drop for a time, and the assassination of Caesar prevented any final decision of the verdict being pronounced. In his speech Cicero briefly dismisses the charge of assassination, the main question being the distribution of the provinces, which was the real cause of the quarrels between Deiotarus and his relatives. After Caesar's death, Mark Antony, for a large monetary consideration, publicly announced that, in accordance with instructions left by Caesar, Deiotarus was to resume possession of all the territory of which he had been deprived. When civil war again broke out, Deiotarus was persuaded to support the anti-Caesarian party of Brutus and Cassius, but after the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, went over to the triumvirs. He remained in possession of his kingdom until his death at a very advanced age. Deiotarus was the patron to whom the Greek agricultural manual by Diophanes of Nicaea was dedicated. He was married to Berenice, Princess of Pergamon, daughter of Attalus III Philomater Euergetes, King of Pergamon, and his wife of the Attalid dynasty. They were the parents of Adobogiona, who married Brogitarus, King of Galatia, who reigned concurrently with his father- in-law.Cicero. De harusp. resp. 13. Adobogiona and Brogitarus were the parents of Amyntas, Tetrarch of the Trocmi and King of Galatia. ==Legacy== The Legio XXII Deiotariana, a Roman legion, traced its lineage back to Deiotarus. It was originally part of the Galatian Army, and the equivalent of three legions. After suffering a defeat it was considered just a single legion, and functioned as an informal Roman legion under Julius Caesar until Deiotarus' death, at which point it was incorporated into the Roman Army with its former king as its namesake. ==See also== *Adobogiona ==Notes== ==References== * Encyclopedia, MS Encarta 2001, under article \\"Galatia\\" * John King, Kingdoms of the Celts. * See also \\"Endnotes\\" in the Encyclopædia Britannica footnote.

Death sits astride a manticore whose long tail ends in a ball of flame (Hell). Famine points to her hungry mouth. The Great Famine of 1315–1317 (occasionally dated 1315–1322) was the first of a series of large- scale crises that struck Europe early in the 14th century. Most of Europe (extending east to Russia and south to Italy) was affected. The famine caused many deaths over an extended number of years and marked a clear end to the period of growth and prosperity from the 11th to the 13th centuries. The Great Famine started with bad weather in spring 1315. Crop failures lasted through 1316 until the summer harvest in 1317, and Europe did not fully recover until 1322. Crop failures were not the only problem; cattle murrains caused sheep and cattle numbers to fall as much as 80%. The period was marked by extreme levels of crime, disease, mass death, and even cannibalism and infanticide. The crisis had consequences for the Church, state, European society, and for future calamities to follow in the 14th century. ==Background== Famines were familiar occurrences in medieval Europe. For example, localised famines occurred in France during the 14th century in 1304, 1305, 1310, 1315–1317 (the Great Famine), 1330–34, 1349–51, 1358–60, 1371, 1374–75, and 1390. In England, the most prosperous kingdom affected by the Great Famine, there were additional famines in 1321, 1351, and 1369. For most people there was often not enough to eat, and life was a relatively short and brutal struggle to survive to old age. According to official records about the English royal family, an example of the best off in society, for whom records were kept, the average life expectancy at birth in 1276 was 35.28 years. Between 1301 and 1325, during the Great Famine it was 29.84 years, while between 1348 and 1375 during the Plague, it was only 17.33 years. It demonstrates the relative steep drop between 1348 and 1375 of about 42%.Note: the average life expectancy figures are inclusive of child mortality which was naturally high compared to that during the modern era, even during non-famine years. During the Medieval Warm Period (the period prior to 1300), the population of Europe exploded compared to prior eras, reaching levels that were not matched again in some places until the 19th century—indeed parts of rural France today are still less populous than at the beginning of the 14th century. However, the yield ratios of wheat, the number of seeds one could eat per seed planted, had been dropping since 1280, and food prices had been climbing. After favourable harvests, the ratio could be as high as 7:1, but after unfavourable harvests it was as low as 2:1—that is, for every seed planted, two seeds were harvested, one for next year's seed, and one for food. By comparison, modern farming has ratios of 30:1 or more (see agricultural productivity). The onset of the Great Famine coincided with the end of the Medieval Warm Period. Between 1310 and 1330, northern Europe saw some of the worst and most sustained periods of bad weather in the entire Middle Ages, characterized by severe winters and rainy and cold summers. The Great Famine may have been precipitated by a volcanic event, perhaps that of Mount Tarawera, New Zealand, which lasted about five years. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, and population level at a historical high made it a time for little margin for error in food production. ==Great Famine== Europe in 1328 In the spring of 1315, unusually heavy rain began in much of Europe. Throughout the spring and the summer, it continued to rain, and the temperature remained cool. Under such conditions, grain could not ripen, leading to widespread crop failures. Grain was brought indoors in urns and pots to keep dry. The straw and hay for the animals could not be cured, so there was no fodder for the livestock. The price of food began to rise; prices in England doubled between spring and midsummer. Salt, the only way to cure and preserve meat, was difficult to obtain because brine could not be effectively evaporated in wet weather; its price increased from 30 to 40 shillings. In Lorraine, wheat prices grew by 320%, making bread unaffordable to peasants. Stores of grain for long-term emergencies were limited to royalty, lords, nobles, wealthy merchants, and the Church. Because of the general increased population pressures, even lower-than-average harvests meant some people would go hungry; there was little margin for failure. People began to harvest wild edible roots, grasses, nuts, and bark in the forests. A number of documented incidents show the extent of the famine. Edward II of England stopped at St Albans on 10 August 1315 and had difficulty finding bread for himself and his entourage; it was a rare occasion in which the King of England was unable to eat. The French, under Louis X, tried to invade Flanders, but in low-lying areas of the Netherlands, the fields were soaked and the army became so bogged down that they were forced to retreat, burning their provisions where they left them, unable to carry them away. In the spring of 1316, it continued to rain on a European population deprived of energy and reserves to sustain itself. All segments of society from nobles to peasants were affected but especially the peasants, who represented 95% of the population and who had no reserve food supplies. To provide some measure of relief, the future was mortgaged by slaughtering the draft animals, eating the seed grain, abandoning children to fend for themselves (see \\"Hansel and Gretel\\") and, among old people, voluntarily refusing food for the younger generation to survive. The chroniclers of the time noted many incidents of cannibalism, although, \\"one can never tell if such talk was not simply a matter of rumor-mongering\\". The height of the famine was in 1317, as the wet weather continued. Finally, in that summer, the weather returned to its normal patterns. By then, however, people were so weakened by diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis, and so much of the seed stock had been eaten, that it was not until 1325 that the food supply returned to relatively normal levels and the population began to increase again. Historians debate the toll, but it is estimated that 10–25% of the population of many cities and towns died. Though the Black Death (1347–1351) would kill more people, it often swept through an area in a matter of months, whereas the Great Famine lingered for years, prolonging the suffering of the populace. Jean-Pierre Leguay noted the Great Famine \\"produced wholesale slaughter in a world that was already overcrowded, especially in the towns, which were natural outlets for rural overpopulation.\\" Estimates of death rates vary by place, but some examples include a loss of 10-15% in the south of England. Northern France lost about 10% of its population. ===Geography=== The Great Famine was restricted to Northern Europe, including the British Isles, Northern France, the Low Countries, Scandinavia, Germany, and western Poland. It also affected some of the Baltic states except for the far eastern Baltic, which was affected only indirectly. The famine was bounded to the south by the Alps and the Pyrenees. ==Consequences== The Great Famine is noteworthy for the number of people who died, the vast geographic area that was affected and its length but also its lasting consequences. ===Church=== In a society whose final recourse for nearly all problems had been religion, and Roman Catholicism was the only tolerated Christian faith, no amount of prayer seemed effective against the root causes of the famine. This undermined the institutional authority of the Roman Catholic Church, and helped lay the foundations for later movements that were deemed heretical by the Roman Catholic Church, as they opposed the papacy and blamed the perceived failure of prayer upon corruption and doctrinal errors within the Roman Catholic Church. ===Cultural=== Medieval Europe in the fourteenth century had already experienced widespread social violence, and even acts then punishable by death such as rape and murder were demonstrably far more common (especially relative to the population), compared to modern times.Historical research has calculated that approximately 12% of human deaths from 700 to 1500 A.D. were homicides, compared to an estimated rate of 1.3% in the 21st century. The famine led to a stark increase in crime, even among those not normally inclined to criminal activity, because people would resort to any means to feed themselves or their family. For the next several decades, after the famine, Europe took on a tougher and more violent edge; it became an even less amicable place than during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. This could be seen across all segments of society, perhaps most strikingly in the way warfare was conducted in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Years' War, when chivalry ended, as opposed to the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries when nobles were more likely to die by accident in tournament games than on the field of battle. The famine also undermined confidence in medieval governments for their failure to deal with its resulting crises. ===Population=== The Great Famine marked a clear end to an unprecedented period of population growth that had started around 1050. Although some believe growth had already been slowing down for a few decades, the famine was undoubtedly a clear end of high population growth. The Great Famine would later have consequences for future events in the fourteenth century, such as the Black Death, when an already weakened population would be struck again. ==See also== *Medieval demography *Popular revolts in Late Medieval Europe *List of famines *Crisis of the Late Middle Ages *The General Crisis ==Notes== ==Further reading== *Aberth, John From the Brink of the Apocalypse: Confronting Famine, Plague, War and Death in the Later Middle Ages, 2000, —Chapter 1, dealing with the Great Famine, is available online. * * * (The first book on the subject, it is the most comprehensive treatment.) * *Kershaw, Ian, \\"The Great Famine and Agrarian Crisis in England 1315–1322\\", Past & Present, 59, pp. 3–50 (May 1973).

He was briefly a national affairs columnist for the Toronto Star in 2016-17. Before that, he was a columnist for Maclean's for 13 years; his column originally appeared in the back page slot famously occupied for many years by Allan Fotheringham, but was subsequently moved to the front of the magazine with other columns. == Background == Wells was born in Sarnia, Ontario, the son of Seigrid Eleanor (Wedin) and Allen Rollins Wells.macleans.ca \\"Lessons from my Dad\\" , 15 Jun 2012 His mother's family was Swedish.http://swedesinminnesota.com/getperson.php?personID=I14708&tree;=minnesota He attended Northern Collegiate Institute and Vocational School where he played trumpet in the school's jazz band and captained a winning Reach for the Top team. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario in 1989 with a BA in political science. While at UWO, Wells spent a lot of his time working on The Gazette, the undergraduate student newspaper, where he was news editor. After graduation, he landed an internship at the Montreal Gazette. Midway through his tenure there, Wells took a year off and moved to France to study politics and improve his French, hoping that this would help him move to the political beat. In 1994 the Gazette assigned Wells to Ottawa as a political columnist. His work for the Gazette and his occasional pieces in Saturday Night magazine during this period brought him to the attention of editors and political writers, and in 1998 Wells moved to the new National Post daily newspaper as a political columnist. Wells became frustrated at the Post after its sale to the Asper family and the severe downsizing that followed, and in 2003 he moved to Maclean's. Wells supplements his weekly column with his blog, Inkless Wells hosted on the Maclean's website. Wells' first book, Right Side Up: The Fall of Paul Martin and the Rise of Stephen Harper's New Conservatism, debuted in October 2006 and quickly appeared on multiple Canadian best seller lists.McClelland.com  Books  Right Side Up by Paul Wells In early 2012, he released his e-book The Harper Decade, following Stephen Harper's rise to power.

Through his many passions in life he contributed to elevating the field of music education to the same stature as the field of musicology. He developed the doctoral program in music education at the University of Michigan, where he directed 51 dissertations. He contributed heavily to the history of music pedagogy in early America, especially singing schools. To combine his two interests of music education and history he joined with Marguerite V. Hood, Warren S. Freeman, and Theodore F. Normann and created the Journal of Research in Music Education (JRME). Less than a decade after developing the journal for Music Educators National Conference (MENC), he became its president from 1960 to 1962. It was during this time that Russia had launched Sputnik and the United States tried to counteract that advancement by going \\"Back to the Basics.\\" This meant that there was little monetary support for music. As the president of the Music Educators National Conference, he took it upon himself to harness the full potential of this organization's political power. MENC, now the National Association for Music Education, has since exercised its influence over numerous political and social actions. ==Early life== Britton was born on May 25, 1914, in Elgin, Kane County, Illinois. He was the oldest son of Walter Allen and Mary (Perdue) Britton. The family lived on a farm just west of Elgin for Allen's first six years, then moved into Elgin. Allen married his high school sweetheart Veronica Fern Wallace on August 30, 1938, in Elgin, Illinois. ==Education== Britton obtained his high school diploma from Elgin High School, Illinois in 1932. He then attended the University of Illinois, from which he graduated with a B.Sc. in Instrumental Music in 1937, and a M.A. in English and Education in 1939. In 1949, he completed his Ph.D. in Musicology at the University of Michigan, his thesis titled Theoretical Introductions in American Tune-Books to 1800. ==Work experience== Britton taught band and English in the public schools of Griffith, Indiana and also at Eastern Illinois University. He served in the US Army during the Second World War as a military policeman and a band member. Britton had learned German from his German-born grandmother. Britton served as assistant professor of music at the University of Michigan from 1950, full professor in 1959, assistant dean in 1960, and as dean of the School of Music from 1971 to 1979. He was also a trustee of the National Music Camp at Interlochen. ==Publications== Britton was founding editor of Journal of Research in Music Education (JRME), at which he worked from 1953 to 1972. He was also the editor of the textbook series Foundations of Music Education and the founding editor of American Music. Britton wrote American Sacred Music Imprints, 1698-1810: A Bibliography with Irving Lowens, American Music Education: Is It Better Than We Think? A Discussion of the Roles of Performance and Repertory, Together With Brief Mention of Certain Other Problems (which was published in Basic Concepts in Music Education), Research in Music Education, with Particular Reference to the Historic and Scientific (which appeared in Music in American Schools 1838-1988 from the University of Maryland).

Radiations may affect one clade or many, and be rapid or gradual; where they are rapid, and driven by a single lineage's adaptation to their environment, they are termed adaptive radiations. ==Examples== Perhaps the most familiar example of an evolutionary radiation is that of placental mammals immediately after the extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. At that time, the placental mammals were mostly small, insect-eating animals similar in size and shape to modern shrews. By the Eocene (58–37 million years ago), they had evolved into such diverse forms as bats, whales, and horses.This topic is covered in a very accessible manner in Chapter 11 of Richard Fortey's Life: An Unauthorised Biography (1997) Other familiar radiations include the Cambrian explosion, the Avalon explosion, the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, the Mesozoic–Cenozoic Radiation, the radiation of land plants after their colonisation of land, the Cretaceous radiation of angiosperms, and the diversification of insects, a radiation that has continued almost unabated since the Devonian, .The radiation only suffered one hiccup, when the Permo-Triassic extinction event wiped out many species. ==Types== Adaptive radiations involve an increase in a clade's speciation rate coupled with divergence of morphological features that are directly related to ecological habits; these radiations involve speciation not driven by geographic factors and occurring in sympatry; they also may be associated with the acquisition of a key trait. Nonadaptive radiations arguably encompass every type of evolutionary radiation that is not an adaptive radiation, although when a more precise mechanism is known to drive diversity, it can be useful to refer to the pattern as, e.g., a geographic radiation. Geographic radiations involve an increase in speciation caused by increasing opportunities for geographic isolation. Radiations may be discordant, with either diversity or disparity increasing almost independently of the other, or concordant, where both increase at a similar rate. Where the mechanism of diversification is ambiguous and the species seem to be closely related, sometimes the terms \\"species radiation,\\" \\"species flock\\" or \\"species complex\\" are used. ==In the fossil record== Much of the work carried out by palaeontologists studying evolutionary radiations has been using marine invertebrate fossils simply because these tend to be much more numerous and easy to collect in quantity than large land vertebrates such as mammals or dinosaurs. Brachiopods, for example, underwent major bursts of evolutionary radiation in the Early Cambrian, Early Ordovician, to a lesser degree throughout the Silurian and Devonian, and then again during the Carboniferous. During these periods, different species of brachiopods independently assumed a similar morphology, and presumably mode of life, to species that had lived millions of years before. This phenomenon, known as homeomorphy is explained by convergent evolution: when subjected to similar selective pressures, organisms will often evolve similar adaptations. Further examples of rapid evolutionary radiation can be observed among ammonites, which suffered a series of extinctions from which they repeatedly re-diversified; and trilobites which, during the Cambrian, rapidly evolved into a variety of forms occupying many of the niches exploited by crustaceans today.Aquagenesis, The Origins and Evolution of Life in the Sea by Richard Ellis (2001) ==Recent examples== A number of groups have undergone evolutionary radiation in relatively recent times. The cichlids in particular have been much studied by biologists. In places such as Lake Malawi they have evolved into a very wide variety of forms, including species that are filter feeders, snail eaters, brood parasites, algal grazers, and fish-eaters.The Cichlid Fishes: Nature's Grand Experiment in Evolution by George Barlow (2002) Caribbean anoline lizards are another well-known example of an adaptive radiation.Parallel Adaptive Radiations - Caribbean Anoline Lizards.

It is owned by the Knowledge Network Corporation, a Crown corporation of the Government of British Columbia, and began broadcasting on January 12, 1981. Rudy Buttignol is president and CEO of British Columbia's Knowledge Network. Knowledge Network’s broadcast licence is for satellite-to-cable programming. The network is available on the Bell Satellite TV satellite service, on channel 268, on Shaw Direct channel 354, and on TELUS Optik TV channel 117. It has also been broadcast over-the-air in remote locations throughout British Columbia, with these repeater sites being operated by local volunteers in the few areas of the province where cable television is not available. The network used the callsign CKNO, although the transmitters were assigned numeric callsigns with the prefix \\"CH\\" due to being low-powered.http://www.global-cm.net/TV%20CAN-BC.pdf Knowledge receives funding both from the British Columbia government and from public donations. The station supports lifelong learning for children and adults by providing quality, commercial-free programming through its broadcast channel, websites and apps. Knowledge Network also invests in documentaries and children’s programs produced by independent filmmakers and helps to develop skills within the independent production community. ==Overview== Knowledge Network is British Columbia's public educational broadcaster and is required to be distributed as part of the basic cable service in British Columbia. When Knowledge first signed on in 1981, its broadcast schedule originally ran from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. In later years, it broadcast from 7:00 a.m.-12 a.m. until July 2007, when programming hours were expanded to 6:00 a.m.-1:00 a.m. In late 2007, Knowledge Network began changing its logo from the green tree to its new wordmark logo, and as of June 2008 the green tree logo has been removed. The channel is currently a 24-hour broadcaster. The network obtains an average of 1.5 million viewers, or over one-third of British Columbians per week. Currently, within the province, the station holds the number one position on weekday mornings for kids age two to six. Also, it has experienced an increase in viewers age 29 to 49 for its prime time programs. In its programming, Knowledge Network covers a range of topics including politics, history and culture, arts and music, health, parenting, and science. It has a children's block, Knowledge Kids, that features characters Luna, Chip and Inkie. With funding from the provincial government and over 40,000 individual donors, Knowledge Network acquires and commissions over 750 hours of original programming per year. In 2011, Knowledge Network acquired Shaw Media's stake in the children's television service BBC Kids, and converted it into a commercial-free service. Knowledge Network launched an HD feed on September 25, 2013. It became available to customers of Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct on October 8, 2013. ==Logos== File:Knowledgenetwork.svgLogo used from 2007–2008 File:Knowledge logo.svgAlternate logo, now used as the on-air bug.

He was the brother of the Pennsylvania Plate Glass Company founder, John Pitcairn, Jr. ==Personal life== Pitcairn was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He accompanied his parents to the United States and settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On July 26, 1856, Robert Pitcairn married Elizabeth Erb Rigg of Altoona, Pa. Their children were: Agnes Laurene Pitcairn (born in 1857), Lillian Pitcairn (born in 1859), Susan Blanche Pitcairn (born in 1868) and Robert Pitcairn, Jr. (born on October 2, 1874). In 1906, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Pitcairn Jr. built a house in Pasadena, California, designed by the outstanding architectural firm Greene and Greene. The Pitcairn family home was at the corner of Ellsworth and Amberson avenues in the Shadyside section of Pittsburgh. Robert Pitcairn was a deeply religious man: he lived his Scottish Presbyterian beliefs as a founder, longtime member and leader of the Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh's fashionable East End. Before the congregation built its current building, for many years, Pitcairn served as its choir director. ==Career== Pitcairn's first job was as a messenger boy for the Eastern Telegraph Company where he worked alongside future steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. In 1853, when Carnegie left to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad, he got Pitcairn a job as a ticket agent at the Mountain House at Hollidaysburg, from there he was transferred to Altoona. Both men worked their way up the corporate ranks rapidly. When Andrew Carnegie left the railroad to start Carnegie Steel, Pitcairn replaced Carnegie as general agent and superintendent of the Pittsburgh division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. He was also a friend and financial backer of George Westinghouse. Pitcairn ordered construction of a rail yard along Turtle Creek near Pittsburgh that would become the largest rail yard in the world. The borough of Pitcairn, Pennsylvania, located adjacent to the yard, was named in his honor. ===Riots of 1877=== Pitcairn was the superintendent of the Pittsburgh division of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company beginning in the Spring of 1865, and occupied that position during the 1877 riots which occurred in Pittsburgh Pa., as part of larger national railroad riots occurring the same year. ===Political and social career=== Pitcairn was a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. The club, founded by Henry Clay Frick and composed of wealthy Pittsburgh industrialists including Carnegie, Andrew Mellon and Philander Knox, owned the South Fork Dam which collapsed on May 31, 1889 causing the Johnstown Flood. Pitcairn was responsible for sending the first relief train to Johnstown to assist flood victims. He was also Past Grand Commander of the Order of Knights Templar, and one of the Directors of the Carnegie Public Library in Pittsburgh. A Republican, Pitcairn served as a Presidential Elector for Pennsylvania in 1904. ===Retirement and death=== While serving as superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Pitcairn was instrumental in implementing a policy that every worker who had been with the company at least 25 years should be pensioned upon reaching the age of 70. He was to become the first recipient of this policy; when he reached 70, President A.J. Cassatt required that Pitcairn, then serving as Resident Assistant to the President, retire. From this point on, Pitcairn's health declined, and in 1909 he died from a \\"general breakdown\\". ==References== ==External links== * Pitcairn's testimony at the PRR's Johnstown Flood inquiry *Scotland's mark on America - Scots in banking, finance, insurance and railroads Category:1836 births Category:1909 deaths Category:19th-century American railroad executives Category:Andrew Carnegie Category:People from Pennsylvania Category:Businesspeople from Pittsburgh Category:People from Johnstone Category:Pitcairn family Category:Scottish emigrants to the United States Category:Pennsylvania Republicans ","title":"Robert Pitcairn"},{"id":"1422777","text":"Assault & Flattery is Toronto's sixth and final album, released in 1984.

It is bordered by Woodrow to the north, the Lower New York Bay to the south, Richmond Valley to the west, and Prince's Bay to the east. The neighborhood is represented in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli. \\"Welcome To Pleasant Plains\\" sign (Amboy Rd. Facing south, corner of Pleasant Plains Ave.; August 2007). View looking north across Mount Loretto Unique Area with church in distance (July 2008). Situated on the island's South Shore, Pleasant Plains has a population of 5,000 according to the 2000 census. It was named by officials of the Staten Island Railroad Corporation, the original owners of what is now known as the MTA Staten Island Railway. When the railroad line was extended to Tottenville in 1860, a station crossing Amboy Road approximately two miles north of Tottenville was named Pleasant Plains. Eventually, the name \\"Pleasant Plains\\" was applied to the community which soon sprung up around the station. ==History== In 1882, a farm southeast of the railroad station was purchased from the Bennett family by the Reverend John Christopher Drumgoole founder of the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin. He started the mission in Manhattan in 1871 originally to aid homeless newsboys. Subsequent parcels were added for a combined area of . The formal name became The Mission of The Immaculate Virgin at Mount Loretto but was and still is referred to solely as \\"Mt. Loretto\\". An orphanage for boys and a working farm was established on the site. At one time it was the largest farm in New York State. In 1888 Father Drumgooles successor began construction on St. Elizabeth's Building, a six-story Georgian Style building to be used as a girls' orphanage with a capacity of 350 children. It was destroyed by fire in Mar. 2000 as a result of arson. The building had been abandoned and neglected for a number of years. A parcel of land south of Hylan Blvd. was sold to The State of New York. The park named, \\"The Mount Loretto Unique Area\\" is maintained by the New York State Dept. of Environmental Conservation. The state park adjoins Lemon Creek Park, which is partially in Pleasant Plains. The Pleasant Plains' portion includes a fishing pier at the foot of Sharrotts Ave. The park contains . high red clay bluffs overlooking Prince’s Bay, part Outer New York Harbor, they are part of the terminal moraine the southern terminous of the Wisconsin Glacier which receded 10,000 yrs. ago./ Geology of Staten Island, College of Staten Island They are the tallest ocean-facing bluffs in New York State. On the highest section of these bluffs The Prince's Bay Lighthouse was built in 1864. The lighthouse has attached living quarters./ Lighthouse Friends. Com In 1978, 126 acres (510,000 m²) on the north side of the property were converted into the Cemetery of the Resurrection by the church's Archdiocese of New York, which needed to open a new cemetery on Staten Island as most of the burial plots at the island's existing Catholic cemeteries had already been used. In 1973, the Church of St. Joachim and St. Anne was destroyed by fire. The exterior of this church was used in the baptism scene from The Godfather the year before. In 2004 a 12-acre (49,000 m²) tract at the northeastern corner of the mission's property, which had been the site of a convent maintained by the Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary, a Franciscan order of nuns, was sold to residential developers for US$19 million, despite steadfast opposition from local conservation activists. Part of the mission property became the Mount Loretto Unique Area. The commercial core of this community centers around the intersection of Bloomingdale Road, Amboy Road and Pleasant Plains Avenue. Like many of the South Shore's old commercial cores, it is experiencing a mild, yet noticeable rebirth. ==Transportation== Pleasant Plains is served by the Staten Island Railway station of the same name near Amboy Road/Bloomingdale Road. It is served by the local bus on Amboy Road and Bloomingdale Road. Express bus service to and from Manhattan is provided by the on Amboy Road and Bloomingdale Road. ==Education== The New York City Department of Education operates public schools. Public school students living in Plesant Plains are zoned for Tottenville High School, which is located in the Huguenot neighborhood of Staten Island. Private school options include Staten Island Academy, a non-religious private school serving grades pre-k3 to 12th grade. Additionally there are numerous Catholic school options such as Saint Joseph By the Sea High School, a co-educational school, Monsignor Farrell High School, an all-boys school, and Notre Dame Academy, which is an all-girls school with an elementary school and High school. The main campus of South Richmond High School, a special education school, is in Pleasant Plains.Fioravante, Janice. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Charleston, Staten Island; Neighborhood That Grew From a Clay Pit.\\" The New York Times.

Design rules for production are developed by process engineers based on the capability of their processes to realize design intent. Electronic design automation is used extensively to ensure that designers do not violate design rules; a process called design rule checking (DRC). DRC is a major step during physical verification signoff on the design, which also involves LVS (layout versus schematic) checks, XOR checks, ERC (electrical rule check), and antenna checks. The importance of design rules and DRC is greatest for ICs, which have micro- or nano-scale geometries; for advanced processes, some fabs also insist upon the use of more restricted rules to improve yield. ==Design rules== The basic DRC checks - width, spacing, and enclosure Design rules are a series of parameters provided by semiconductor manufacturers that enable the designer to verify the correctness of a mask set. Design rules are specific to a particular semiconductor manufacturing process. A design rule set specifies certain geometric and connectivity restrictions to ensure sufficient margins to account for variability in semiconductor manufacturing processes, so as to ensure that most of the parts work correctly. The most basic design rules are shown in the diagram on the right. The first are single layer rules. A width rule specifies the minimum width of any shape in the design. A spacing rule specifies the minimum distance between two adjacent objects. These rules will exist for each layer of semiconductor manufacturing process, with the lowest layers having the smallest rules (typically 100 nm as of 2007) and the highest metal layers having larger rules (perhaps 400 nm as of 2007). A two layer rule specifies a relationship that must exist between two layers. For example, an enclosure rule might specify that an object of one type, such as a contact or via, must be covered, with some additional margin, by a metal layer. A typical value as of 2007 might be about 10 nm. There are many other rule types not illustrated here. A minimum area rule is just what the name implies. Antenna rules are complex rules that check ratios of areas of every layer of a net for configurations that can result in problems when intermediate layers are etched. Many other such rules exist and are explained in detail in the documentation provided by the semiconductor manufacturer. Academic design rules are often specified in terms of a scalable parameter, λ, so that all geometric tolerances in a design may be defined as integer multiples of λ. This simplifies the migration of existing chip layouts to newer processes. Industrial rules are more highly optimized, and only approximate uniform scaling. Design rule sets have become increasingly more complex with each subsequent generation of semiconductor process. ==Software== The main objective of design rule checking (DRC) is to achieve a high overall yield and reliability for the design. If design rules are violated the design may not be functional. To meet this goal of improving die yields, DRC has evolved from simple measurement and Boolean checks, to more involved rules that modify existing features, insert new features, and check the entire design for process limitations such as layer density. A completed layout consists not only of the geometric representation of the design, but also data that provides support for the manufacture of the design. While design rule checks do not validate that the design will operate correctly, they are constructed to verify that the structure meets the process constraints for a given design type and process technology. DRC software usually takes as input a layout in the GDSII standard format and a list of rules specific to the semiconductor process chosen for fabrication. From these it produces a report of design rule violations that the designer may or may not choose to correct. Carefully \\"stretching\\" or waiving certain design rules is often used to increase performance and component density at the expense of yield. DRC products define rules in a language to describe the operations needed to be performed in DRC. For example, Mentor Graphics uses Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) language in their DRC rules files and Magma Design Automation is using Tcl- based language. A set of rules for a particular process is referred to as a run-set, rule deck, or just a deck. DRC is a very computationally intense task. Usually DRC checks will be run on each sub-section of the ASIC to minimize the number of errors that are detected at the top level. If run on a single CPU, customers may have to wait up to a week to get the result of a Design Rule check for modern designs. Most design companies require DRC to run in less than a day to achieve reasonable cycle times since the DRC will likely be run several times prior to design completion. With today's processing power, full-chip DRC's may run in much shorter times as quick as one hour depending on the chip complexity and size. Some example of DRC's in IC design include: *Active to active spacing *Well to well spacing *Minimum channel length of the transistor *Minimum metal width *Metal to metal spacing *Metal fill density (for processes using CMP) *Poly density *ESD and I/O rules *Antenna effect ===Commercial=== Major products in the DRC area of EDA include: * Advanced Design System Desktop DRC by PathWave Design (Keysight Technologies Previously Agilent's EEsof EDA division) * Calibre by Mentor Graphics * Diva, Dracula, Assura and PVS by Cadence Design Systems * Hercules and IC Validator by Synopsys * Guardian by Silvaco * HyperLynx DRC Free/Gold by Mentor Graphics * PowerDRC/LVS by POLYTEDA LLC * Quartz by Magma Design Automation ===Free software=== * Electric VLSI Design System http://www.staticfreesoft.com/ * KLayout https://klayout.de/ * Magic http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/ ===References=== *Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook, by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, A survey of the field, from which part of the above summary were derived, with permission.

It officially opened on May 1, 1989. In September 2008, all of its clubs were closed, but its retail stores and restaurants remained open. The area is now called The Landing and is the central part of Disney Springs. ==History== Pleasure Island in 1995Pleasure Island opened emulating Church Street Station in Downtown Orlando, Florida. At that time, this was a highly successful gated attraction which offered admission to multiple clubs for one price. The legend the Disney Company created is that Pleasure Island was based on the fictitious owner, Merriweather Adam Pleasure, and was carried on into one of its clubs, The Adventurers Club. Merriweather Pleasure was an industrialist and explorer that decided to move his family to Florida and start a new sailmaking and yacht construction business on the island during the 1920s through early 1940s. He enjoyed throwing parties for his employees and friends after hours, but eventually, he was lost at sea, his sons failed at running the company without him and the island was mostly destroyed in a storm. As the story goes, Disney would rediscover the ruins of the Pleasure complex and establish a nightclub district to carry on Pleasure's merrymaking spirit. Every night at midnight, \\"New Year's Eve\\" was celebrated at Pleasure Island with a fireworks show. This tradition lasted from 1990 through New Year's Eve 2005. ===Changes in 2006=== Major renovations to Pleasure Island were made in March 2006 in an attempt to reverse declining attendance. These changes included the closing and dismantling of the West End Stage and the Hub Stage. Since there was no longer an entry fee, the free entertainment provided by these stages was attracting large groups of local teens which was considered undesirable. The area formerly occupied by the West End Stage is the location of the new pedestrian bridge to Downtown Disney West Side and provides visitors a greater line-of- sight view from Pleasure Island to the West Side. The removal of the Hub Stage opened a small area to a view of the lagoon located behind Pleasure Island, including a dock. In late June 2006, a life-size Jessica Rabbit sign above the facility of \\"Pleasure Island Tonight!\\" was removed. The construction of new docks allow boat transportation links between West Side, Pleasure Island, Marketplace, and Disney resorts across the lagoon and up the Sassagoula River. ===Changes from 2007 to 2009=== Effective January 1, 2007, the dance clubs reverted to a policy which required guests to be age 21 or older. Minors could still visit the Comedy Warehouse and Adventurers Club, as well as the shops and restaurants on the island. In late June 2008, Disney announced that the six remaining night clubs at Pleasure Island would close by September 28, 2008, to make room for additional family-oriented entertainment. Effective June 27, 2008, customers who purchased annual passes to Pleasure Island could receive a pro-rated refund for that purchase, due to the September 2008 scheduled closure of all of its nightclubs. Disney officials stated that the Pleasure Island nightclub closures are in response to customers who desire more broad-based dining and retail opportunities.The party's over at Pleasure Island: Disney to shut down 6 nightclubs - OrlandoSentinel.com September 27, 2008 was Pleasure Island's last night. Among the capacity crowd were many of its past actors and cast members, some of whom started to line up at 9am to ensure entrance to what would be a very emotional and busy night. Highlights included Frankie and the West End Boys playing on the waterfront stage. At midnight, \\"New Year's Eve\\" was celebrated one last time. A fireworks show was complemented by popular songs heard on the island over the years. The final song played in Mannequins was \\"Everybody’s Free (To Feel Good)\\" by Rozalla. With that, Pleasure Island was officially shut down. By the next day, many of the clubs' signs and logos were being removed or painted over. In February 2009, amid rumors of a partial reopening of Pleasure Island, Disney announced that three former clubs would become available for private party rentals. Motion, Soundstage Club, and Adventurers Club were available for rental through the end of March 2010. In 2009, a building that previously housed stores and a fast food restaurant was completely renovated by E-Brands, the operator of the Samba Room restaurant in Orlando, into Paradiso 37, a Central/South American-themed restaurant. ===Hyperion Wharf=== On November 10, 2010 Disney announced Hyperion Wharf would be the new name for Pleasure Island. The new theme of the island would be an early 20th-century nautical warehouse district. $3.2 million in new lighting features were to be added, in addition to a waterfront entertainment area and a lighthouse structure. No names for shops, restaurants or entertainment venues were announced. There was no indication that any of the former clubs would reopen. Permits and plans showed the buildings which formerly housed the Motion and Rock 'n' Roll Beach Club, Adventurers Club and BET Soundstage Club would be demolished. The buildings which formerly housed the Comedy Warehouse, 8TRAX and Mannequins clubs would remain. Demolition of Motion and Rock 'n' Roll Beach Club took place between December 2010 and February 2011. Earlier in 2010, the bridge from the Downtown Disney Marketplace to Pleasure Island was widened to accommodate a new, wider pedestrian pathway across the island. On December 3, 2012, Disney allowed the trademark for Hyperion Wharf to expire. Renovation plans for the area were announced as part of the Downtown Disney redevelopment in 2013. During 2014, Disney closed access to the Pleasure Island portion of Downtown Disney, as additional retailers and theme restaurants were brought into the mix. Disney ultimately decided against using the name \\"Hyperion Wharf\\". ===The Landing=== Instead, in April 2015, Disney reopened Pleasure Island as the middle link of the Downtown Disney shopping area. This section of the complex is now called \\"The Landing.\\" The former dance clubs, jazz club and Adventurer's Club are no longer part of the concept. Instead, the area focuses on retail and restaurants, though one restaurant circuitously links the new area to its predecessor: Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar was ostensibly opened by pilot Jock Lindsey (who appeared in the 1981 Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark), who is a member of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers. A fez housed in the Skipper Canteen in Magic Kingdom's Adventureland establishes that Pleasure Island founder Merriweather Adam Pleasure was also a member of the S.E.A., with his Adventurers club retroactively serving as his own private chapter of the Society. ==Operating attractions== ===Restaurants=== * Paradiso 37 — A North, South and Central American restaurant named for the 37 countries located in those areas, and includes a food court section as well as an upscale tequila bar. It features a focus on dishes famously sold by street vendors in those countries. This restaurant is managed by E Brands, and was the first new restaurant to open from the Pleasure Island renovations which began in 2008. It is located in a building which formerly housed shops and a fast food restaurant. Dishes include sandwiches, steaks, chicken, and an extensive appetizer menu. Paradiso 37 opened on June 4, 2009. * Portobello Restaurant — An Italian restaurant patterned after an osteria. It opened with the clubs in 1989. Portobello Restaurant was known as Portobello Yacht Club until renovations in late 2008. In the context of the Island's backstory, the restaurant was once the Pleasure Family Home. * Raglan Road Irish Pub & Restaurant — Operated by Great Irish Pubs Florida. It opened in October 2005, replacing Merriweather's Market and the Pleasure Island Jazz Company. ===Shopping=== For many years, a number of small shops and boutiques were located between the Adventurers Club and Rock 'n' Roll Beach Club. Many of these shops closed in March 2006 as part of the renovation of the island. However, Disney has begun to reintroduce selected stores on the island. * Curl by Sammy Duvall — A surf-themed retail establishment operated by Florida-based water skier Sammy Duvall. Curl opened in 2008, replacing Superstar Studios. * Fuego by Sosa Cigars — A cigar bar which opened in 2007, located near the center of the island. * Orlando Harley- Davidson — A \\"gear shop\\" operated by Orlando's Harley-Davidson franchiser. It opened in 2005, located near Raglan Road. * Walrus Pit ==Former attractions== ===Shopping=== * Superstar Studios — A long-time \\"make-your-own-video\\" studio which was replaced by Curl by Sammy Duvall in 2008. * Jessica's - A store featuring the character Jessica Rabbit from the 1989 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which opened in 1990 and closed in 1992. A two-sided, thirty-foot neon sign of Jessica Rabbit with a swinging leg and moving sequins hung over the building until the store's closing. In 1993, the sign was relocated to the West End Stage where it resided until 2006. * Avigators Supply - A store located close to the Adventurers Club. It sold aviation and adventure gear branded with the Avigators logo. It also sold Adventurers Club and Indiana Jones merchandise. It was replaced by Mouse House which was replaced by Paradiso 37. * Changing Attitudes - Trendy clothing and unusual gifts.Pleasure Island Guide Fall 1993 * Doodles - Pleasure island memorabilia, hip graphic T-shirts, trendy gifts. * Hammer and Fire - Hand-crafted jewelry, accessories and unusual gifts. * The Mouse House - Disney T-shirts, plush animals and gifts. * Suspended Animation - Disney animated cels, posters, prints and lithographs. * DTV - Modern Disney fashions from silks and sequins to painted jeans. * Music Legends - Clothing, books, music, and music memorabilia. ===Restaurants=== Fulton's Crab House riverboat restaurant * Fulton's Crab House — A seafood restaurant which has been operated by Levy Restaurants since March 10, 1996. It originally opened on May 1, 1977 as the Empress Lilly. The head chef is Frank Walason. * The Empress Lilly — An authentic recreation of a 19th-century paddle steamer boat in Rococo (Louis XIV) style. It was operated by Disney and named in homage to Walt Disney's's wife Lillian. Upon becoming Fulton's Crab House, the boat lost its paddle wheel and smokestacks. It was divided into four separate restaurants and lounges, including the Baton Rouge Lounge, Steerman's Quarters, Fisherman's Deck, and the Empress Room. * Fireworks Factory — A pyrotechnics-themed restaurant operated by Levy Restaurants. According to the island's fictional backstory, Merriweather Pleasure manufactured fireworks in the building until one of his cigars caused an explosion. The restaurant was decorated with authentic pyrotechnic props from the Grucci family. It operated from 1989–1997, and was replaced by the Motion dance club. * Merriweather's Market — A food court that operated from 1989–1993, and was replaced by Raglan Road Irish Pub & Restaurant in October 2005. * Planet Hollywood - It was a Pleasure Island attraction when it opened in 1994. In 1998 it moved to West Side. In 2017 it was replaced by the Planet Hollywood Observatory. * Hill Street Diner - Pizza, hotdogs, hot deli sandwiches, french fries and assorted salads. * D-Zertz - Cappuccino and espresso, pastries, frozen yogurt and soft serve ice cream with toppings. ===Entertainment=== * 8TRAX — A 1970s and 1980s themed dance club. It closed on September 27, 2008. The club opened on December 31, 1992 , replacing: **Videopolis East — Opened in 1989, playing new wave music on 170 video screens. In 1990 it was renamed Cage, adding more progressive music before closing in 1992. * Adventurers Club — A 1930s-style British explorers' club that featured a staff of flamboyant characters portrayed by improv actors. The club closed on September 27, 2008. * BET Soundstage — A hip-hop and R&B; dance club operated by Black Entertainment Television (formerly BET Holdings Inc). It closed on September 27, 2008. The licensing agreement with BET Holdings Inc. was created before Black Entertainment Television was purchased by Viacom in 2000. The club opened in 1998, replacing: **Neon Armadillo — A club featuring live country music bands, it operated from 1989–1998. * Celebrate Tonight — An outdoor dance party featuring DJs and cast members known as the Party Team. Focused mainly on families with children, it opened in early April 2009 and closed on June 26, 2010. It took place in the large brick expanse between the former Comedy Warehouse and BET Soundstage, an area renamed Celebration Plaza. * Comedy Warehouse — A nightclub which featured an improv comedy troupe. It originally featured a parody show called \\"Forbidden Disney\\". The club soon attracted a large return audience. The move to the improv format after a couple of seasons was made to keep the show fresh. The club closed September 27, 2008. * Mannequins Dance Palace — A techno-trance multi-story dance club which featured a revolving lighted dance floor. The club featured nightly light shows with synchronized music and live performances by human \\"mannequins\\".

They eventually sold their interest in the building back to Disney, and the venue closed in 2001. * Pleasure Island Jazz Company — A club featuring live jazz musicians which opened on August 27, 1993. It was replaced by Raglan Road Irish Pub & Restaurant in October 2005. * Rock 'n' Roll Beach Club — A rock-themed dance club which featured live bands (usually local cover bands). It closed on February 2, 2008. The club opened on April 4, 1990, replacing: **XZFR Rockin' Rollerdrome — A short lived club where guests could strap on skates and dance to rock and roll *West End Stage - A stage used for events every night. The roof of the stage was torn down in 2009 and most of the stage was taken to the Disney Boneyard with small parts intact. It was replaced by Celebration Plaza in 2009. *AMC Pleasure Island 24 - In April 1990 these theaters opened with 10 screens as a Pleasure Island attraction but in January 1998 AMC expanded to 24 screens and became a part of West Side. The name was changed in 2010 to AMC Theatres Downtown Disney 24 and then, the name was changed to AMC Theatres Disney Springs 24 in 2015. In 1989, New Kids on the Block performed at Pleasure Island. In '92, Marky Mark & the Funky Bunch performed there. In '93, Blind Melon played the West End Stage. In 1995, Johnny Cash played there. In '95, Boy George performed there. In '95, Orlando's own *NSYNC filmed a demo at Rock 'n' Roll Beach Club. In '97, Savage Garden played there. In '99, Christina Aguilera performed on the West End Stage. On New Year's Eve in 1999, Hootie & the Blowfish performed there with The B-52's from Georgia and Styx. In 2000, Duran Duran performed at Pleasure Island. ====Gallery==== Image:Adventurer's club.jpgThe cast of the Adventurers Club.

Briceville played an important role in three major late-19th and early-20th century incidents related to the region's coal mining activities: the Coal Creek War in 1891, the Fraterville Mine disaster of 1902, and the Cross Mountain Mine disaster of 1911. ==History== The Knoxville Iron Company, cofounded by Welsh immigrants in 1868, began mining coal in the Coal Creek Valley in the late 1860s, initially hauling the coal from the mines via wagon, and later by railroad after the completion of a Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad line between Knoxville and Coal Creek (now Lake City) in 1869. In subsequent years, Knoxville Iron and other companies gradually worked their way up the Coal Creek Valley, opening mines in The Wye, Fraterville, and Slatestone Hollow. In 1888, at Senator Calvin Brice's behest, a railroad spur was built connecting Coal Creek with Slatestone Hollow. After this line's completion, the Slatestone Hollow community was renamed \\"Briceville.\\" Briceville and the Coal Creek Valley grew rapidly in the 1890s as the demand for coal soared. By 1900, the valley had over 4,000 residents, and by 1910 Briceville was the largest community in Anderson County. Briceville's most prominent structure, the Briceville Community Church, was built by volunteers in 1887 on a hill near the center of the community. The church was initially non-denominational, but as the community's population grew, Baptists and Presbyterians built their own churches, and in 1896 the Briceville Community Church became a Methodist church. ===Coal Creek War=== Briceville in 1891, at the start of the Coal Creek War In the early 1890s, Briceville played a central role in the Coal Creek War, a labor uprising that grew out of local coal miners' opposition to the state's practice of leasing prisoners to businesses, which reduced the need for conventional labor.James B. Jones, Jr., Convict Lease Wars, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Three of the conflict's chief instigators-- Eugene Merrell, George Irish, and S. D. Moore-- lived in Briceville. Merrell, a French-born Knights of Labor activist, had been chased out of mining towns in Indiana before settling in Briceville, where he was blacklisted for Union activities in 1889, and made his living operating a mercantile store. Irish, who also operated one of the community's mercantile stores, had lived in the area since 1880. Moore was a local Baptist preacher and farmer.Karin Shapiro, A New South Rebellion: The Battle Against Convict Labor in the Tennessee Coalfields, 1871-1896 (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1998), pp. 85, 99, 205. In the spring of 1891, miners at the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC) mine in Briceville went on strike after the company demanded they sign an iron-clad contract. To break the strike, TCMC leased several dozen convicts from the state, built a stockade in Briceville to house them, and reopened its mine on July 5, 1891. On July 14, 300 armed miners attacked the stockade and marched the convicts out of the valley. This action prompted Governor John P. Buchanan to lead the state militia into the valley to restore order. On July 16, Buchanan met with the Briceville miners at Thistle Switch (just north of Briceville), where he made a plea for calm, but was shouted down by Merrell, who demanded the governor enforce the state's laws against iron-clad contracts.Shapiro, pp. 75-102. The miners seized the TCMC stockade again on July 20, prompting Buchanan to request a 60-day truce while he summoned the legislature to discuss the issue. The legislature rejected the miners' demands, however, and on October 31, the miners burned the Briceville stockade and freed all of its convicts.Shapiro, pp. 134-144. The conflict, which eventually spread across the state's entire Cumberland Plateau region, dragged on for several months before the militia launched a crackdown in August 1892, arresting hundreds of miners. Merrell fled the state, and Irish and Moore were arrested. While the uprising was crushed, it induced the state to end the convict lease system.Shapiro, pp. 184-205. ===Fraterville Mine disaster=== In 1902, an explosion occurred at a mine in Fraterville-- which lies almost adjacent to Briceville to the northeast-- killing 216 miners, including several Briceville residents. A large memorial service for the Fraterville deceased was held at the Briceville church on June 8, 1902. At least one victim of the explosion is buried in the church's cemetery. ===Cross Mountain Mine disaster=== On December 9, 1911, an explosion occurred at the Cross Mountain Mine, which lay at the end of Slatestone Hollow in the extreme west of Briceville. The explosion killed or trapped 89 miners who had entered the mine that morning, although five were eventually freed by an intensive rescue effort initiated by the Bureau of Mines. Several miners killed in this explosion were buried in a circular formation known as the Cross Mountain Miners' Circle, located in Circle Cemetery just off Highway 116 near the Laurel Branch Baptist Church. Others were buried in the Briceville Community Church's cemetery.Coal Creek Watershed Foundation, \\"Cross Mountain Mine Disaster and Rescue,\\" 2000-2008. Retrieved: 15 February 2010. ==Post office== The Briceville post office was established in 1888. As of 2011, it served a population of about 1,400 in Briceville and northwestern Anderson County, with 332 post office boxes in the post office and one rural postal carrier route extending from Fraterville to the New River community.Bob Fowler, Briceville residents ponder possible loss of community's post office, Knoxville News Sentinel, July 29, 2011 In July 2011 the U.S. Postal Service identified it as one of 3,653 retail post offices proposed for closure.

It is a fervent plea for religious tolerance. It was never performed during Lessing's lifetime and was first performed in 1783 at the Döbbelinsches Theater in Berlin. Set in Jerusalem during the Third Crusade, it describes how the wise Jewish merchant Nathan, the enlightened sultan Saladin, and the (initially anonymous) Templar, bridge their gaps between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. Its major themes are friendship, tolerance, relativism of God, a rejection of miracles and a need for communication. ==Synopsis== The events take place during the Third Crusade (1189-1192) during an armistice in Jerusalem. When Nathan, a wealthy Jew, returns home from business travel, he learns that his foster daughter Recha was saved from a house fire by a young Christian Templar. The knight, in turn, owes his life to the Muslim ruler of Jerusalem, Sultan Saladin, who pardoned him as the only one of twenty prisoners because he looks like Saladin's late brother Assad. Despite these fortunate circumstances, the rational-thinking Nathan is unwilling to believe the events to be a miracle and also convinces Recha that believing in the work of guardian angels is harmful. Saladin, somewhat indifferent in terms of money, is currently in financial trouble. That is why, on the advice of his more calculating sister Sittah, he has the wealthy Nathan brought to him to test his generosity, which is praised throughout Jerusalem: Instead of asking him directly for a loan, Saladin pretends that he wants to test Nathan's famous wisdom and asks him about the \\"true religion\\". Nathan, who had already been informed about Saladin's financial troubles by his friend Al-Hafi and warned of his financial recklessness, recognizes the trap. He decides to answer Saladin's question with a \\"fairy tale\\", the so-called \\"ring parable\\". Deeply impressed, Saladin immediately understands this parable as a message about the equality of the three major monotheistic religions. Moved by Nathan's humanity, he asks him to be his friend from now on. Nathan willingly agrees and, on top of that, grants Saladin a generous loan without being asked. The Templar, who had saved Recha from the flames, but, until now, was not willing to meet her, is united with her by Nathan. He falls head over heels in love with her and wants to marry her on the spot. However, his name makes Nathan hesitate to give his consent, which insults the Templar. When he finds out from Recha's companion Daja, a Christian, that Recha is not Nathan's biological daughter, but is only adopted, and that her biological parents were Christians, he turns to the patriarch of Jerusalem for advice. Although the Templar frames his request as a hypothetical case, the fanatical head of the church guesses what this is about and wants to search for \\"this Jew\\" immediately and have him burned at the stake for temptation to apostasy. He does not consider Nathan's noble motives and the fact that Nathan did not raise the Christian child as a Jew, but on the contrary in no belief, does not soften the patriarch's stance, but aggravates him: \\"That’s nothing! Still the Jew is to be burnt— / And for this very reason would deserve / To be thrice burnt.\\" Through records of the friar who once brought Recha to Nathan as a toddler, it finally turns out that Recha and the Christian Templar are not only brothers and sisters - hence Nathan's reservations about marriage - but also the children of Saladin's brother Assad. These connections are revealed to everyone in the final scene at Saladin's palace, which ends with all main characters repeatedly embracing each other in silence. ==Ring Parable== The centerpiece of the work is the \\"Ring Parable\\", narrated by Nathan when asked by Saladin which religion is true: an heirloom ring with the magical ability to render its owner pleasing in the eyes of God and mankind had been passed from father to the son he loved most. When it came to a father with three sons whom he loved equally, he promised it (in \\"pious weakness\\") to each of them. Looking for a way to keep his promise, he had two replicas made, which were indistinguishable from the original, and gave on his deathbed a ring to each of them. The brothers quarreled over who owned the real ring. A wise judge admonished them that it was impossible to tell at that time – that it even could not be discounted that all three rings were replicas, the original one having been lost at some point in the past; that to find out whether one of them had the real ring it was up to them to live in such a way that their ring's powers could prove true, to live a life that is pleasant in the eyes of God and mankind rather than expecting the ring's miraculous powers to do so. Nathan compares this to religion, saying that each of us lives by the religion we have learned from those we respect.An English translation of the Parable, with German original at: http://www.gkoehn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NathanTransExcerpt.pdf ==Background== The character of Nathan is to a large part modeled after Lessing's lifelong friend, the eminent philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Like Nathan the Wise and Saladin, whom Lessing brings together over the chess- board, they shared a love for the game.Daniel Dahlstrom, Moses Mendelssohn, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 3 December 2002. Accessed online 26 October 2006. The motif of the Ring Parable is derived from a complex of medieval tales which first appeared in the German language in the story of Saladin's table in the Weltchronik of Jans der Enikel. Lessing probably had the story in the first instance from Boccaccio's Decameron.The Decameron consists of ten tales told on each of ten days. The \\"Ring Parable\\" is found in the third tale of the first day, although the characters here are Saladin and Melchisedech (as the wise Jew). ==English language translations and stage adaptations== * Nathan the Wise: a Philosophical Drama, translated by Rudolf Erich Raspe.

Melbourne Gardens was founded in 1846 when land was reserved on the south side of the Yarra River for a new botanic garden. It extends across that slope to the river with trees, garden beds, lakes and lawns. It displays almost 50,000 individual plants representing 8,500 different species. These are displayed in 30 living plant collections. Cranbourne Gardens was established in 1970 when land was acquired by the Gardens on Melbourne's south-eastern urban fringe for the purpose of establishing a garden dedicated to Australian plants. A generally wild site which is significant for biodiversity conservation, it opened to the public in 1989. On the site, visitors can explore native bushland, heathlands, wetlands and woodlands. One of the features of Cranbourne is the Australian Garden, which celebrates Australian landscapes and flora through the display of approximately 170,000 plants from 1,700 plant varieties. It was completed in 2012. Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria is home to the State Botanical Collection which is housed in the National Herbarium of Victoria, including 1.5 million preserved plants, algae and fungi, and Australia's most comprehensive botanical library. ==Governance and history== The gardens are governed under the Royal Botanic Gardens Act 1991 by the Royal Botanic Gardens Board, who are responsible to the Minister for Environment. In 1846 Charles La Trobe selected the site for the Royal Botanic Gardens from marshland and swamp. In 1857 the first director was Ferdinand von Mueller, who created the National Herbarium of Victoria and brought in many plants. In 1873 William Guilfoyle became Director and changed the style of the Gardens to something more like the picturesque gardens that were around at that time. He added tropical and temperate plants. In 1877 Sir Edmund Barton, Australia's first Prime Minister and Jane Ross were married at the Royal Botanic Gardens. In 1924 a shooting massacre occurred at the Gardens resulting in the death of four people.Massacre at the Botanical Gardens Retrieved 11 January 2020 In June 2015 the Gardens brought together the elements of the organisation under the name Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, incorporating Melbourne Gardens, Cranbourne Gardens, the National Herbarium of Victoria and the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology (ARCUE) ==Horticulture== Ornamental Lake Southern Lawn Autumn at the gardens Living collections at the Botanic Gardens include the Australian Forest Walk, California Garden, Cacti and Succulents, Camellia Collection, Cycad Collection, Eucalypts, Fern Gully, Grey Garden, Herb Garden, Long Island, New Caledonia Collection, New Zealand Collection, Oak Lawn, Perennial Border, Roses, Southern Africa Collection, Southern China Collection, Tropical Display-Glasshouse, Viburnum Collection and Water Conservation Garden. ==Ecology== The gardens include a mixture of native and non-native vegetation which invariably hosts a diverse range of both native and non-native fauna. The gardens host over 10,000 floral species, the majority being non-native species. The gardens were the origin from which many introduced species spread throughout south-eastern Australia as seeds were traded between early European botanists in the mid-19th century, studying the Australian flora. ===Native vegetation=== From the gardens establishment in 1846, much of the native vegetation was removed as botanists such as Baron Von Mueller planted a range of species from around the world. While initially much of the native wetlands and swamplands in the gardens were left, around the turn of the 20th century these were re-landscaped to create the Ornamental Lake. Despite this however, there are some large eucalypts remaining including the prominent Separation Tree, a 300-year-old River Red Gum, under which Victoria was declared a separate colony.

The Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne focus solely on Australian native plants. ===Non-native traditional gardens=== The Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne were initially intended to be a horticultural exhibition for the public to enjoy, many seeds were traded between early European botanists such as Arthur and Von Mueller, who planted non-native species. The Queen and her grandfather, Dame Nellie Melba and Paderewski contributed plantings on occasions throughout the gardens history. ===Plant science=== Since its earliest days, the Royal Botanic Gardens is involved in plant research and identification. This is done primarily through the National Herbarium of Victoria, which is based at the Gardens. The Herbarium is also home to the State Botanical Collection, which includes over 1.2 million dried plant specimens, and an extensive collection of books, journals and artworks. Research findings are published in the journal Mulleria, which is a scientific representation of the work done in the Gardens in any one year. More recently, the Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology has been established to look at plants which grow in urban environments specifically.

It is targeted to women, offering a blend of lifestyle, information and entertainment programming. Until 2018, OWN was the only Canadian channel maintaining a brand licensing deal with Discovery Inc. that was not owned by Bell Media and remains the only other Canadian network that Discovery does not have an ownership stake in (the other being Investigation Discovery). After completing its acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive in 2018, Discovery took stakes in the Canadian versions of DIY Network, Food Network, Cooking Channel and HGTV; all of which are majority- owned by Corus Entertainment. ==History== ===As Canadian Learning Television=== In September 1996, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Ltd. (LSTA) (controlled by CHUM Limited through a 60% interest in the company) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) called Canadian Learning Television. The channel was licensed to provide \\"formal and informal educational programs on a wide range of topics.\\" Canadian Learning Television logo used from 1999 to 2003. The channel launched on September 1, 1999 as Canadian Learning Television,Official Website Archive retrieved on 2011-09-18 with a mix of educational and informational television programs. CHUM would later gain 100% ownership of the channel when it completed its purchase of the remaining interest in LSTA on February 15, 2005.The history of CHUM, The Globe and Mail, June 12, 2006. The company would later be renamed Access Media Group. In 2003, Canadian Learning Television adopted a new logo and on-air presentation. With this change, the channel began using the brand \\"CLT\\" in most media, instead of using its full name, although Canadian Learning Television remained the official name of the channel. Logo as CLT (2003-2008), often the wording below the circle was omitted In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, included in the sale was CLT.Bell Globemedia acquires CHUM ; Fasken Martineau; 2006-07-12 The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165; CRTC; 2007-06-08 and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007. In less than a year after taking ownership of Canadian Learning Television, on March 7, 2008, CTVglobemedia announced it would sell the channel to Corus Entertainment for approximately $73 million CAD. The deal was approved by the CRTC on August 22, 2008.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-206; CRTC; 2008-08-22 The transaction was then finalized on September 1, 2008. ===Refocusing as a lifestyle channel=== In October 2008, Corus announced it would relaunch CLT as Viva, a female-focused entertainment and lifestyle channel targeting the baby boomer demographic. The rebrand took effect on November 3, 2008.Corus set to bow new women's specialty net MediaInCanada.com 2008-10-15 Logo used as Viva On September 29, 2010, Corus announced it had finalized an agreement to launch a Canadian version of the Oprah Winfrey Network in Canada in 2011. Although Corus had said the new channel would involve rebranding an existing channel owned by the company, it had not announced which channel it would be, nor did Corus announce a specific launch date. However, in November 2010, Corus announced that Viva would be rebranded as OWN on March 1, 2011,CORUS ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES MARCH 1, 2011 AS THE CANADIAN LAUNCH DATE FOR OWN: OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK, CNW, 2010-11-09 two months after the Discovery Health channel in the United States was relaunched as the Oprah Winfrey Network on January 1. During that time, select OWN programming was broadcast on Viva and on another Corus-owned female-targeted channel, W Network. An HD feed was also launched. ====CRTC licence controversy==== In December 2012, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission held a hearing investigating OWN's non- compliance with its mandate to air formal education programming – a holdover of its establishment as Canadian Learning Television. Although Corus stated that it was planning changes to the network's programming to comply with the requirements (including the introduction of four new weekly educational programs to its lineup), the CRTC warned that it could revoke the channel's license or require Corus to apply for a new category B license to operate the channel under. right On March 15, 2013, the CRTC further issued a \\"mandatory order\\", the last step before license revocation. The order asked for the reduction of programming about \\"life enhancement,\\" and for more programming addressing the building of job and credit-building skills, along with violations of programming, including airing films, which the network is not allowed to do, and that what did air had only a short professor introduction without any tie-in to the film. The CRTC increased monitoring requirements for the network and asked Corus for a new programming plan to be introduced no later than April 5. In October 2015, the requirement to air adult education programming, as well as the increased monitoring requirements, were both dropped by the CRTC at the request of Corus, as the CRTC is currently in the process of discontinuing the genre protection rules as part of reforms to policies regarding specialty television services. ==Programming== When the channel was launched as CLT, it aired a mix of formal and informal educational and informational programming in the style of newsmagazines, talk shows, documentaries, and more. Over time, the channel introduced more entertainment- based programs such as films and television dramas. The channel maintained a similar scheduling format as Access (now CTV Two Alberta), a television service in Alberta which aired a mix of entertainment and educational programming, both of which were under the same ownership of CHUM and later CTVglobemedia before CLT was sold to Corus Entertainment. As Viva, the channel aired a mix of entertainment and loosely based educational programming to satisfy its CRTC licence requirements, and to that end, many programs continued to be tied to some sort of ongoing course at a Canadian post- secondary institution as it did under CLT. However, with the changeover to Viva, most of the programs had begun with a short introduction from an instructor at the applicable institution. Under the OWN moniker, the channel continues to target female audiences with programming ranging from lifestyle and information to entertainment programming. ===Current=== As of April 2015http://tvschedule.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=20714&channel;=72&aid;=tvschedule * 2 Fat 2 Fly * 20/20 * All for Nothing? * Anna & Kristina's Grocery Bag * Be the Boss Canada * Breaking Down the Bars * Cold Blood * Dateline * Divine Design * Extreme Makeover: Home Edition * Family Feud * Ghostly Encounters * Iyanla, Fix My Life * Motives & Murders: Cracking the Case * Murder She Solved * Oprah's Master Class * Oprah's Next Chapter * Oprah: Where Are They Now? * Our America with Lisa Ling * Psychic Investigators * Rescue Mediums * Super Soul Sunday * The Devil You Know * To Catch a Killer * Undercover Boss * Undercover Boss Canada * What Would You Do? ===Former=== * Buy.o.logic * Chef Worthy * Dark Waters of Crime * Eat Yourself Sexy * Extraordinary Acts of Courage * Extreme Clutter with Peter Walsh * Fearless in the Kitchen * Golden Sisters * The Haves and the Have Nots * He Said, She Said * Healthy Gourmet * Houston Beauty * In the Bedroom with Dr. Laura Berman * Let's Learn Japanese (as CLT) * Maxed Out * Million Dollar Neighbourhood * Miracle Detectives * Mystery Diagnosis * Remedy Me! * Searching For... * Shimmy * Simple Fresh Delicious * Snapped * The Cupcake Girls * The Locator * The Nate Berkus Show * The Oprah Winfrey Show * The Right Fit * The Shopping Bags * Tosca: Flexing at 49 * True CSI * Unfaithful: Stories of Betrayal ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 Category:Corus Entertainment Category:Analog cable television networks in Canada Category:Oprah Winfrey Category:Women's interest channels Category:English-language television stations in Canada Category:1999 establishments in Canada ","title":"Oprah Winfrey Network (Canadian TV channel)"},{"id":"1422848","text":"Gertrude E. \\"Trudy\\" Pitts (August 10, 1932 – December 19, 2010) was an American soul jazz keyboardist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was known primarily for playing the Hammond B3 organ. ==Biography== Trained as a musician and a music educator, Pitts studied at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, Temple University and Juilliard, as well as other institutions. Early work experience included a position as an assistant to the pianist in the Tony Award-winning musical Raisin. At the end of the musical's tour, she was encouraged by her husband (who had worked with Shirley Scott as a drummer) to continue developing her repertoire. In 1967, the Boston Globe printed a piece calling her a rising star and complimented her drawbar variation, vibrato shadings, and bass pedal work. Her husband, William Theodore Carney II (born 1925), aka \\"Mr. C.\\", often joined her on the drums. Trudy Pitts eventually went on to play with Ben Webster, Gene Ammons, and Sonny Stitt. She recorded four albums for Prestige Records, appearing with Willis Jackson among others. In 1999, a compilation album of several records was released as Legends of Acid Jazz: Trudy Pitts With Pat Martino. Recent festival appearances include the 11th Annual Mary Lou Williams Women in Jazz Festival at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in May 2006. On September 15, 2006, Pitts was the first jazz artist to play a concert on Philadelphia's Kimmel Center's 7,000 pipe organ, \\"taking the medium to a whole new level\\". In 2008, she again performed on an exceptional organ, this time the Kennedy Center's Filene Organ.

An original member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of that group in 2015 and the Blues Hall of Fame in his own right in 2016. Bishop feels that the limitations of his voice have helped his songwriting. ==Early life and education== Bishop was born in Glendale, California, the son of Mylda (Kleege) and Elvin Bishop, Sr. He grew up on a farm near Elliott, Iowa. His family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma when he was 10. There he attended Will Rogers High School, winning a full scholarship to the University of Chicago as a National Merit Scholar. He moved to Chicago in 1960 to attend the university, where he majored in physics. ==Career== In 1963, Bishop met harmonica player Paul Butterfield in the neighborhood of Hyde Park and joined Butterfield's blues band, and remained with them for five years. Bishop was originally Butterfield's only guitarist, but was later joined by Mike Bloomfield, who largely took over the lead guitar role for the band's classic first two albums. After Bloomfield departed, the Butterfield Band's third album, The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw, took its name from Bishop's nickname and his renewed role as lead guitarist. Bishop recorded a fourth album, In My Own Dream, with Butterfield, his last with the band, in 1968. During his time with the Butterfield Blues Band, Bishop met blues guitarist Louis Myers at a show. Bishop persuaded Myers to trade his Gibson ES-345 for Bishop's Telecaster. Bishop liked the Gibson so much he never gave it back and has used it throughout his career. Bishop has nicknamed his Gibson ES-345 \\"Red Dog,\\" a name he got from a roadie for the Allman Brothers Band. In 1968, he went solo and formed the Elvin Bishop Group, also performing with Bloomfield and Al Kooper on their album titled The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper. The group signed with Fillmore Records, which was owned by Bill Graham, who also owned the Fillmore music venues. Bishop sat in with the Grateful Dead on June 8, 1969, at the Fillmore West in San Francisco. He opened the second set with the lengthy blues jam \\"Turn on Your Lovelight\\" without Pigpen or Jerry. He played two more songs with the Dead, \\"The Things I Used to Do\\" and \\"Who's Lovin' You Tonight.\\" Photo of the group in 1975 In March 1971, The Elvin Bishop Group and The Allman Brothers Band co-billed a series of concerts at the Fillmore East. Bishop joined The Allman Brothers Band onstage for a rendition of his own song, \\"Drunken-Hearted Boy.\\" Over the years, Bishop has recorded with many other blues artists, such as John Lee Hooker, and with Zydeco artist Clifton Chenier. In late 1975, he played guitar for a couple of tracks on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll album and, in 1995, he toured with B.B. King. Bishop made an impression on album-oriented rock FM radio stations with \\"Travelin' Shoes\\" in 1975 but, a year later, in 1976, Bishop released his most memorable single, \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love,\\" which peaked at No. 3 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart (and No. 34 in the UK Singles Chart). The recording featured vocalist Mickey Thomas and drummer Donny Baldwin who both later joined Jefferson Starship. During the 1960s and 1970s he recorded for the Fillmore, Epic and Capricorn labels. Bishop performing at the Riverwalk Blues Festival, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in February 2006 Bishop appeared at the 1984 Long Beach Blues Festival. In 1988, he signed with Alligator Records and released Big Fun featuring Whit Lehnberg & The Carptones, 1991's Don't Let the Bossman Get You Down, 1995's Ace in the Hole, 1998's The Skin I'm In and That's My Partner (2000), on which he paired with an early Chicago blues teacher, Little Smokey Smothers. He later revisited Smothers in the studio, where the two recorded another album in 2009, Little Smokey Smothers & Elvin Bishop: Chicago Blues Buddies. Bishop was inducted into the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2005, Bishop released his first new solo CD in seven years, Gettin' My Groove Back. In 2008, Bishop released The Blues Rolls On, on September 23, 2008, switching labels to Delta Groove Music. He was supported by Tommy Castro, James Cotton, Warren Haynes, B.B. King, Derek Trucks, George Thorogood, Kim Wilson, John Németh and Angela Strehli. The album was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album. In 2010, Bishop released Red Dog Speaks. His first live concert DVD, That's My Thing: Elvin Bishop Live in Concert, was recorded live at the Club Fox in Redwood City, California, on December 17, 2011. It was released on the Delta Groove label in October 2012. The DVD was nominated for Best Blues DVD of 2012 by the Blues Foundation. The same organization announced that Bishop had six nominations for the 36th Blues Music Awards held in May 2015. He triumphed in three of them. In April 2015, Bishop was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an original member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. In November 2017, his album Elvin Bishop's Big Fun Trio received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album. The Grammy was won by The Rolling Stones for Blue and Lonesome. ==Personal life== Bishop's daughter Selina and ex-wife Jennifer Villarin were murdered along with three other victims in an August 2000 crime spree. The culprits were later identified as Selina's then-boyfriend Glenn Taylor Helzer, Helzer's brother Justin Helzer, and accomplice Dawn Godman. The murders reportedly occurred as part of a scheme to extort money from an elderly couple from Concord, California. Both killers were sentenced to death for the murders; Justin Helzer, blind and partially paralyzed from an attempt on his own life while incarcerated, committed suicide in San Quentin prison. ==In popular culture== Charlie Daniels mentions Bishop in his 1975 song \\"The South's Gonna Do It\\", with the lyric, \\"Elvin Bishop sittin' on a bale of hay; he ain't good lookin', but he sure can play.\\" Bishop, on his 1974 album Let it Flow, had previously mentioned Charlie Daniels. Molly Hatchet also references Bishop in their 1978 song \\"Gator Country\\", with the lyrics, \\"Elvin Bishop out struttin' his stuff with little Miss Slick Titty Boom, I'm goin' back to the Gator Country and get me some elbow room.\\" \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\\" was included in the soundtrack album for Guardians of the Galaxy titled Awesome Mix Vol. 1. The song also is heard playing during the wedding reception scene after Billy Riggins and Mindy Collette were married in the Friday Night Lights episode \\"Tomorrow Blues\\" (Season 3, Episode 13). This song can also be heard playing in the background in the local bar scene between Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson in the movie The Family Stone. Jeff Garlin's character plays this song during a scene in the Netflix comedy, Handsome. The song was also featured in a memorable scene in the movie Boogie Nights (1997), at Jack's pool party early in the film, and was featured on the second volume of the movie soundtrack, Boogie Nights 2: More Music from the Original Motion Picture. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *The Elvin Bishop Group (Fillmore, 1969) *Feel It!

It developed as a distinct strain of thought after Otto von Bismarck's unification of the German states but began its development in earnest only under Emperor Wilhelm II. Central concepts concerning the German race regarding economic space demonstrate continuity from the German Empire to Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. However, imperial geostrategist, German geopoliticians, and Nazi strategists did not have extensive contacts with one another, suggesting that German geopolitik was not copied or passed on to successive generations but perhaps reflected the more permanent aspects of German geography, political geography, and cultural geography. It developed from widely varied sources, including the writings of Oswald Spengler, Alexander Humboldt, Karl Ritter, Friedrich Ratzel, Rudolf Kjellén, and Karl Haushofer. It was eventually adapted to accommodate the ideology of Hitler. Its defining characteristic is the inclusion of organic state theory, informed by social Darwinism. It was characterized by clash of civilizations-style theorizing. It is perhaps the closest of any school of geostrategy to a purely nationalistic conception of geostrategy, which ended up masking other more universal elements. Germany acted as a revisionist state within the international system during both World Wars by attempting to overthrow British domination, and counter what it saw as rising US and Russian hegemony. As a latecomer to nationhood proper, lacking colonies or markets for industrial output but also experiencing rapid population growth, Germany desired a more equitable distribution of wealth and territory within the international system. Some modern scholars have begun to treat the two World Wars, participated in by Germany, as a single war in which the revisionist Germany attempted to bid for hegemonic control with which to reorder the international system.Gilpin, p. 200; Knutsen, pp. 6–7; Tammem, pp. 51–52; Rasler & Thompson, p. 4. German foreign policy was largely consistent in both wars. The Nazi foreign policy was unique insofar as it learned from what it saw as past imperial mistakes but essentially followed the very same designs laid out by German geopolitik and the historical record of the empire. == Geopolitik rises == German geopolitik contributed to Nazi foreign policy chiefly in the strategy and justifications for Lebensraum. It contributed five ideas to German foreign policy in the interwar period: the organic state; lebensraum; autarky; pan-regions and the land power/sea power dichotomy. Geostrategy as a political science is both descriptive and analytical like political geography but adds a normative element in its strategic prescriptions for national policy.Mattern, pp. 40–41. While it stems from earlier US and British geostrategy, German geopolitik adopts an essentialist outlook toward the national interest, oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a panacea.Walsh, p. 41. As a new and essentialist ideology, geopolitik found itself in a position to prey upon the post–World War I insecurity of the populace.Mattern, p. 32. In 1919, General Karl Haushofer would become professor of geography at the University of Munich. That would serve as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas, magazine articles and books. By 1924, as the leader of the German geopolitik school of thought, Haushofer would establish the Zeitschrift für Geopolitik monthly, devoted to geopolitik. His ideas would reach a wider audience with the publication of Volk ohne Raum by Hans Grimm in 1926, popularizing his concept of lebensraum.Dorpalen, pp. 16–17. Haushofer exercised influence both through his academic teachings, urging his students to think in terms of continents and emphasizing motion in international politics, and through his political activities.Walsh, pp. 4–5. While Hitler's speeches would attract the masses, Haushofer's works served to bring the remaining intellectuals into the fold.Beukema, pxiii. Geopolitik was in essence a consolidation and codification of older ideas, given a scientific gloss: * Lebensraum was a revised colonial imperialism; * Autarky a new expression of tariff protectionism; * Strategic control of key geographic territories exhibiting the same thought behind earlier designs on the Suez and Panama canals; and * Pan-regions based upon the British Empire, and America's Monroe Doctrine, Pan- American Union and hemispheric defense.Mattern, p. 37. The key reorientation in each dyad is that the focus is on land-based empire rather than naval imperialism. Ostensibly based upon the geopolitical theory of US naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan, and British geographer Halford J. Mackinder, German geopolitik adds older German ideas. Enunciated most forcefully by Friedrich Ratzel and his Swedish student Rudolf Kjellén, they include an organic or anthropomorphized conception of the state, and the need for self-sufficiency through the top-down organisation of society. The root of uniquely German geopolitik rests in the writings of Karl Ritter who first developed the organic conception of the state that would later be elaborated upon by Ratzel and accepted by Hausfhofer. He justified Lebensraum, even at the cost of other nations' existence, because conquest was a biological necessity for a state's growth.Walsh, p. 39. === Friedrich Ratzel === Friedrich Ratzel Ratzel's writings coincided with the growth of German industrialism after the Franco- Prussian war and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with England. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion.Mattern, p. 60. Influenced by Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self- sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.Dorpalen, pp. 66–67. Haushofer was exposed to Ratzel, who was friends with Haushofer's father, a teacher of economic geography,Dorpalen, p. 52. and would integrate Ratzel's ideas on the division between sea and land powers into his theories by saying that only a country with both could overcome the conflict.Dorpalen, pp. 68–69. Here, Hitler diverged with Haushofer's writings in consigning Germany to sole pursuit of land power. Ratzel's key contribution was the expansion on the biological conception of geography, without a static conception of borders. States are instead organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement.Dorpalen, pp. 49–50, 61–62. It is not the state proper that is the organism but the land in its spiritual bond with the people who draw sustenance from it.Mattern, p. 55. The expanse of a state's borders is a reflection of the health of the nation.Mattern, p. 58. Haushofer adopts the view that borders are largely insignificant in his writings, especially as the nation ought to be in a frequent state of struggle with those around it.Dorpalen, pp. 61–62. Ratzel's idea of Raum would grow out of his organic state conception. The early Lebensraum was not political or economic but spiritual and racial nationalist expansion.Dorpalen, p. 56. The Raum-motiv is a historically driving force, pushing peoples with great Kultur to naturally expand.Mattern, p. 56. Space for Ratzel was a vague concept, theoretically unbounded just as was Hitler's. Raum was defined by where German people live, where other inferior states could serve to support German people economically and German culture could fertilise other cultures.Dorpalen, pp. 58–59. Haushofer would adopt that conception of Raum as the central program for German geopolitik, and Hitler's policy would reflect the spiritual and cultural drive to expansion. === Rudolph Kjellén === Rudolph Kjellén was Ratzel's Swedish student who would further elaborate on organic state theory and first coined the term \\"geopolitics\\".Mattern, p. 63. Kjellén's State as a Form of Life would outline five key concepts that would shape German geopolitik.Mattern, p. 73. * Reich was a territorial concept that comprised Raum, Lebensraum, and strategic military shape.Mattern, p. 76. * Volk was a racial conception of the state. * Haushalt was a call for autarky based on land, formulated in reaction to the vicissitudes of international markets.Mattern, p. 78. * Gesellschaft was the social aspect of a nation's organization and cultural appeal,Mattern, p80. Kjellén going further than Ratzel in his anthropomorphic view of states relative to each other.Mattern, p69. And finally, * Regierung was the form of government whose bureaucracy and army would contribute to the people's pacification and coordination.Mattern, p. 87. Kjellén disputed the solely legalistic characterization of states by arguing that state and society are not opposites but rather a synthesis of the two elements. The state had a responsibility for law and order but also for social welfare/progress, and economic welfare/progress.Mattern, p. 65, 86. Autarky, for Kjellén, was a solution to a political problem, not an economic policy proper. Dependence on imports would mean that a country would never be independent. Territory would provide for internal production. For Germany, Central and Southeastern Europe were key, along with the Near East and Africa. Haushofer was not interested in economic policy, but advocated autarky as well; a nation constantly in struggle would demand self-sufficiency.Dorpalen, p. 221, 223. === Haushofer's contribution === Haushofer's geopolitik expands upon that of Ratzel and Kjellén. While the latter two conceive of geopolitik as the state as an organism in space put to the service of a leader, Haushofer's Munich school specifically studies geography as it relates to war and designs for empire.Dorpalen, p. 23–24. The behavioral rules of previous geopoliticians were thus turned into dynamic normative doctrines for action on lebensraum and world power.Dorpalen, p. 54. Haushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as \\"the duty to safeguard the right to the soil, to the land in the widest sense, not only the land within the frontiers of the Reich but also the right to the more extensive Volk and cultural lands\\". Culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic special expansion. It provided a guide as to the best areas for expansion and could make expansion safe, but projected military or commercial power could not.Dorpalen, p80. Haushofer even held that urbanisation was a symptom of a nation's decline by giving evidence of a decreasing soil mastery, birth rate and effectiveness of centralized rule.Dorpalen, p. 78. To Haushofer, the existence of a state depended on living space, the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies. Germany had a high population density, but old colonial powers had a much lower density, a virtual mandate for German expansion into resource-rich areas.Dorpalen, pp. 38–39. Space was seen as military protection against initial assaults from hostile neighbors with long-range weaponry. A buffer zone of territories or insignificant states on one's borders would serve to protect Germany.Dorpalen, pp. 94–95. Closely linked to that need was Haushofer's assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the international system. The small states surrounding Germany ought to be brought into the vital German order.Dorpalen, pp. 205–206. These states were seen as being too small to maintain practical autonomy even if they maintained large colonial possessions and would be better served by protection and organization within Germany. In Europe, he saw Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Switzerland, Greece and the \\"mutilated alliance\\" of Austria-Hungary as supporting his assertion.Dorpalen, p. 207, 209. Haushofer's version of autarky was based on the quasi-Malthusian idea that the earth would become saturated with people and no longer able to provide food for all. There would essentially be no increases in productivity.Dorpalen, p. 237. Haushofer and the Munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past the borders of 1914 and \\"a place in the sun\\" to a New European Order and then to a New Afro-European Order and eventually to a Eurasian Order.Mattern, p. 17. That concept became known as a pan-region, taken from the Monroe Doctrine, and the idea of national and continental self- sufficiency.Mattern, p. 39. It was a forward-looking refashioning of the drive for colonies, something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity but more as a matter of prestige and putting pressure on older colonial powers. The fundamental motivating force would be not economic but cultural and spiritual.Dorpalen, pp. 235–236. Beyond being an economic concept, pan-regions were a strategic concept as well. Haushofer acknowledges the strategic concept of the Heartland, put forward by the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder.Dorpalen, p218. If Germany could control Eastern Europe and subsequently Russian territory, it could control a strategic area to which hostile seapower could be denied.Mackinder, p78. Allying with Italy and Japan would further augment German strategic control of Eurasia, with those states becoming the naval arms protecting Germany's insular position.Walsh, p9. ==== Contacts with Nazi leadership ==== Evidence points to a disconnect between geopoliticians and the Nazi leadership, although their practical tactical goals were nearly indistinguishable. Rudolf Hess, Hitler's secretary who would assist in the writing of Mein Kampf, was a close student of Haushofer's. While Hess and Hitler were imprisoned after the Munich Putsch in 1923, Haushofer spent six hours visiting the two, bringing along a copy of Friedrich Ratzel's Political Geography and Carl von Clausewitz's Vom Kriege.Walsh, pp. 14–15. After World War II, Haushofer would deny that he had taught Hitler, and claimed that the National Socialist party perverted Hess's study of geopolitik. He viewed Hitler as a half-educated man who never correctly understood the principles of geopolitik passed onto him by Hess, and Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop as the principle distorter of geopolitik in Hitler's mind.Walsh, p. 15. While Haushofer accompanies Hess on numerous propaganda missions, and participated in consultations between Nazis and Japanese leaders, he claimed that Hitler and the Nazis only seized upon half-developed ideas and catchwords.Walsh, p. 8. Furthermore, the Nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik, leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of Haushofer's theories. Ultimately, Hess and Von Neurath, Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs, were the only officials Haushofer judged to have had a proper understanding of geopolitik.Walsh, pp. 35–36. Father Edmund A. Walsh S.J., professor of geopolitics and dean at Georgetown University, who interviewed Haushofer after the allied victory in preparation for the Nuremberg trials, disagreed with Haushofer's assessment that geopolitik was terribly distorted by Hitler and the Nazis. He cites Hitler's speeches declaring that small states have no right to exist and the Nazi use of Haushofer's maps, language and arguments. Even if distorted somewhat, Fr. Walsh felt that was enough to implicate Haushofer's geopolitik.Walsh, p. 17, 41. Haushofer also denied assisting Hitler in writing Mein Kampf, saying that he knew of it only once it was in print and never read it.Walsh, p. 36. Fr. Walsh found that even if Haushofer did not directly assist Hitler, discernible new elements appeared in Mein Kampf, as compared to previous speeches made by Hitler. Geopolitical ideas of lebensraum, space for depth of defense, appeals for natural frontiers, balancing land and seapower, and geographic analysis of military strategy entered Hitler's thought between his imprisonment and publishing of Mein Kampf. Chapter XIV, on German policy in Eastern Europe, in particular displays the influence of the materials Haushofer brought Hitler and Hess while they were imprisoned.Walsh, p. 42. Haushofer was never an ardent Nazi, and did voice disagreements with the party, leading to his brief imprisonment. He did profess loyalty to the Führer and make anti-Semitic remarks on occasion. However, his emphasis was always on space over race.Mattern, p. 20. He refused to associate himself with anti-Semitism as a policy, especially because his wife was half-Jewish.Walsh, p. 40, 35. Haushofer admits that after 1933 much of what he wrote was distorted under duress: his wife had to be protected by Hess's influence; his son was murdered by the Gestapo; he himself was imprisoned in Dachau for eight months; and his son and grandson were imprisoned for two-and-a-half months.Walsh, p. 16. == Hitler's geostrategy == The name \\"National Socialism\\" itself describes the fundamental orientation of Hitler's foreign policy. The nation, as a concept, was historically used almost interchangeably with race or ethnicity. Even under the legalistic framework of the League of Nations for European state relations, states had been drawn upon ethnically determined boundaries, following the tenets of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points speech.Wilson. The first priority of the National Socialists was to focus on the racial aspects of foreign policy. Socialism, on the other hand, is focused on the equitable distribution and redistribution of material goods within an economic system. As a latecomer to nationhood proper and industrialization, Germany was far behind other older colonial powers in the acquisition of territory abroad. Burdened with a burgeoning population, Germany had lagging ability to raise agricultural production to meet food demands, compete in markets for industrial goods, obtain cheap sources of raw materials, and find an acceptable outlet for emigration. National Socialist foreign policy thus focused on what they perceived as a more equitable international redistribution of material resources and markets.Mattern, pp. 119–120. Hitler's foreign policy strategy can be divided into two main concepts: race and space. In 1928, Hitler dictated the text of a follow-up text to Mein Kampf focused on the elaboration of the foreign policy concepts he had previously set forth.Weinberg, \\"Introduction.\\" p. xiv, xxi. Unedited and unpublished, it allows a clearer picture of Hitler's thoughts than the edited and revised Mein Kampf or his populist and over-simplified speeches. There is a lack of development or major shifts in his worldview between the 1926 volume and his assumption of power in 1933, supporting the idea that Hitler was not a foreign policy opportunist but that his ideas were specific and formed before he had the power to implement his designs.Weinberg, \\"Introduction.\\" p. xxvi. Hitler outlined eight principles and four goals that were to guide his foreign policy. The principles were concerned with the German military, the League of Nations and the situation with France. Hitler's first concern was the reinvigoration of the German military without which all other aims could not be achieved. The League of Nations was a prohibitive factor in the development and change of Germany because those with influence in the League were the same states that had demanded Germany's crippling.Hitler, p. 153. Germany could not hope for allies found outside the League but only discontented states that would be willing to break away. They would not be willing to leave unless Germany established a clear and articulated foreign policy, with clear costs and consequences, which the others could then follow. He cautions, however, that Germany cannot rely upon inferior allies, undesirable either by dint of their race or past military weakness.Hitler, pp. 153–154. France and the containment alliance it led against Germany could not be challenged without the strong military that Hitler envisioned and a decisive preemptive strike. He recognized that no matter what path Germany takes to regain its strength, France would always assist or even lead a coalition against it.Hitler, p. 154. Hitler's goals for Nazi foreign policy were more straightforward, focusing on German space rather than the strictly racial aspects of his policy. His designs are meant to give Germany the focus that it lacked in the previous thirty-five years of \\"aimlessness.\\".Hitler, p. 157. He calls for a clear foreign policy of space, not international trade or industry. The concept of Lebensraum in the East overrided any perceived need for naval power, which would only bring Germany into conflict with England and Italy. Industrial exports and trade would require a merchant marine force, meeting most directly with the enmity of England, and France its willing ally. Therefore, land expansion was Hitler's primary goal, eschewing the borders of 1914; he calls them nationally inadequate, militarily unsatisfactory, ethnically impossible, and insane when considered in light of Germany's opposition in Europe.Hitler, pp. 158–159. === Race === While the goals and principles Hitler enunciated were primarily focused on the redistribution of space, they grew out of his focus on race. By 1923, Hitler had outlined his basic ideas on race. According to Hitler, the Jews had betrayed Germany in World War I, which necessitated a domestic revolution to remove them from power. He saw history as governed by the racial aspects of society, both internal and national. In his mind, a vulgarized sort of Social Darwinism determined the rise and fall of civilizations.Weinberg, pp. 2–3. The world was composed not of states but of competing races of different values,Hitler, p. 34. and politics was fundamentally a struggle led by those with the greatest capacity for organization, a characteristic held by Germanic peoples more than any other.Hitler, p. 9. Nations of pure and strong racial makeup would eventually prosper over those with ideas of racial equality: France is condemned in this regard because of its acceptance of blacks and the use of black units in World War I against German troops. Acceptance of inferior races is intimately connected to the Jewish menace and its threat to the strength of the Germanic race.Weinberg, p4–5. The vital strength of a race and its will to survive were the most important conditions which would lead to a resurgence of Germany despite its lack of resources and materiel.Hitler, p. 29. The re-establishment of a truly nationalist German army, free from the hired mercenaries of the imperial era, was Hitler's first goal.Hitler, p. 93. With the threat or use of force, Germany would be able to move forward in achieving its goals for space. Thus, he implemented the Four Year Plan in order to overcome internal obstacles to military growth. A German army of considerable size would push its neighbors into conciliation and negotiation without the need for actual military adventures.Weinberg, pp. 359–360. In justifying the need for decisive military action, Hitler cites a lesson from World War I: those that are neutral gain a little in trade but lose their seat at the victor's table and thus their right to decide the structure of the peace to follow. He thus renounced neutrality and committed his country to taking vital risks that would lead to greater gains.Hitler, p. 129. === Space === Hitler's racial ideas were indirectly expressed in his concept of space for German foreign policy. Space was not a global concept in the same way that older imperial states conceived of it, with their massive colonial empires dividing up the world abroad. Hitler saw value in only adjacent and agriculturally viable land, not in trade and industry outlets that required a maritime orientation. He had no faith in increasing productivity, thus leading to the need to expand within Europe.Weinberg, pp. 5–6. Lebensraum for Germany required moving beyond the \\"arbitrary\\" goal of the border of 1914, expanding into the East and adopting policies toward the Western European nations, Great Powers, and treaty arrangements, which would facilitate this land redistribution. A lack of space for a race's growth would lead to its decay through degenerate population control methods and dependence upon other nations' imports. Expansion is directly correlated to the race's vitality, space allowing for larger families that would repopulate the nation from the losses it incurs fighting wars for territory. Where Hitler's expansionism differed most from that of imperial nations was his idea of racial purity, which required driving out or exterminating the native populations of any conquered territory.Weinberg, p. 6. Industry and trade were only transient solutions, subject to the vicissitudes of the market, likely leading to war as economic competition escalates.Hitler, p. 26. Lebensraum was thus the only permanent solution for securing the German race's vitality.Hitler, p. 17, 51. Colonies would take far too long to solve the Reich's agriculture and space problem; furthermore, they constitute a naval and industrial policy rather than a land- based agricultural policy, which is where Germany's strength lies.Hitler, p. 76–77. Thus, Hitler committed Germany to a role as a land power rather than a sea power and focused his foreign policy on attaining the highest possible concentration of land power resources for a future that lay in Europe.Hitler, p. 227. The racial struggle for space envisioned by Hitler was essentially unlimited, a policy that could only have two results: total defeat or total conquest. Hess discovered in 1927, while the two were imprisoned at Landsberg prison, that Hitler believed only one race with total hegemony could bring about world peace.Weinberg, p. 7. Hitler confirmed this attitude, regarding Europe specifically, in August 1943 speaking to his naval advisors and declaring, \\"Only if all of Europe is united under a strong central power can there be any security for Europe from now on. Small sovereign states no longer have a right to exist\\".Walsh, p. 48. In Mein Kampf, Hitler states his view that the total (but, as he saw it, temporary) destruction of civilization was, to him, an acceptable condition of final Aryan victory. Lebensraum as a foreign policy concept was based upon domestic considerations, especially that of population growth and the pressure it placed upon existing German resources. War, for Lebensraum, was justified by the need to re-establish an acceptable ratio between land and people.Hitler, p. 18. Whereas the Weimar Republic foreign policy was based on borders, the National Socialist foreign policy would be based on space and expansionism and point to fundamentally different conceptions of world order: the bourgeois saw in terms of states and law, but Hitler maintained an image of ethnic or racially defined nationhood.Hitler, p. 49. Lebensraum served to create the economic condition of autarky in which the German people would be self-sufficient, no longer dependent on import or subject to demand shifts in international markets, which had been forcing industry to struggle against other nations.Hitler, p. 228. To achieve Lebensraum, Hitler cautioned against what he saw as a dangerous Weimar policy of demanding a return to the 1914 borders. Foremost and inexcusable in his mind, the borders would not unite all ethnic Germans under the Reich.Hitler, p. 102. To commit to a nation of all German-speaking peoples, the borders of 1914 must be abandoned as incompatible with racial unity and their arbitrary nature.Hitler, pp. 96–98. Open advocacy of border restoration would only urge a coalition to form against Germany before it could raise an army to achieve its ends.Hitler, pp. 94–95. Further, he believed that empty saber rattling on this issue would shift public opinion against Germany in support of France's anti-German measures, and even if it was achieved, it would guarantee only instability without achieving the racial goals that he sees as so central to German vitality.Hitler, p. 119. The doctrine of space focused on Eastern Europe, taking territory from the ethnically inferior Slavs.Weinberg, p. 12. While Western European nations were despised for allowing racial impurity, they were still essentially Aryan nations, but the small and weak Slavic nations to the East were legitimate targets. In talking to the Associated Press, Hitler commented that if Germany acquired Ukraine, Urals and territory into the heartland of Siberia, it would be able to have surplus prosperity. Thus, Germany would have to be concerned about the newly independent states to the East, sitting between Germany and its goal of Russian territory. Such states, especially the reconstituted Poland, were viewed as Saisonstaat, or states that exist for no enduring reason.Weinberg, p. 13. No alliance with Russia would be possible either because of German designs on Eastern territory.Hitler, p. 134, 152. Still, Hitler maintained faith that if Germany were to make clear its aspirations for space in the inferior East, the Great Powers in Europe would not intervene, with the possible exception of France. === Great Power relationships === Because of French opposition, it was crucial for Germany's plans to defeat France before moving against the states in the East and Russia.Weinberg, p. 14. As France was an ally of Poland and Yugoslavia, a supporter of racial equality and a constant opponent of German designs, action against France was deemed the highest priority in allowing German designs to come to fruition. By allying with states hostile to France and its coalition, Germany's military first strike would be quickly successful.Weinberg, pp. 19–20. Britain was supposed to be Germany's natural ally, according to Hitler. It maintained good relations with Italy and shared key German interests, the foremost of which was that neither country desired a French continental hegemon.Hitler, p. 226. Since Hitler had decided to abandon Germany's naval power, trade and colonial ambitions, he believed that the British would be likely to ally with Germany against France, which still maintained conflicting interests with Britain. Because Russia threatened British interests in Middle Eastern oil and India, action against Russia ought to also find German and Britain on the same side.Weinberg, p. 15. Italy would serve as Germany's other natural ally. Hitler perceived that their interests as being far enough apart that they would not come into conflict.Hitler, p. 225. Germany was concerned primarily with Eastern Europe, and Italy's natural domain was the Mediterranean. Still, their divergent interests both led them into conflict with France. Ideological ties were supposed to ease their relations, providing something more than simply shared interests to bind them together.Weinberg, p. 16–17. The major sticking point between the two countries was the province of South Tyrol. Hitler believed, incorrectly in retrospect, that if he were to cede the territory, Italy would drop its objections to the Anschluss.Weinberg, p. 18. Hitler repeatedly stressed another long term fear, apparently driving his desire for German economic domination of European resources, which was the rise of the United States of America as a great power. Underlining his lack of faith in the ability to increase agricultural or industrial productivity, he cites America's vast size as the reason that economic policy will fail, and expansionism can be the only route for Germany.Hitler, p. 107. He rejects popular conceptions of a Pan-European economic union designed to counter American economic power by saying that life is not measured by quantity of material goods but by the quality of a nation's race and organization.Hitler, p. 113. Instead of the Pan-Europe, Hitler desires a free association of superior nations bound by their shared interest in challenging America's domination of the world. In his mind, US economic power is more threatening than British domination of the world. Only after defeating France and Russia could Germany establish its Eurasian empire that would lead nations against the USA, whose power he saw as undermined by its acceptance of Jews and Blacks.Weinberg, p. 21. === Bases for Hitler's strategies === In constructing the designs for Europe, Hitler realized that treaties would serve him as only short-term measures. They could be used for immediate space-gaining instruments, partitioning third countries between Germany and another power, or they could function as a means of delaying a problem until it could be dealt with safely. Treaties of alliance were regarded as viable only if both parties clearly gained; otherwise, they could legitimately be dropped. Multilateral treaties were to be strenuously avoided.Weinberg, p8, 359. Even among countries that shared interests, alliances could never be planned on being permanent, as the allied state could become the enemy at short notice.Hitler, p. 127. Still, Hitler realized that Germany would need allies in order to successfully leave the League of Nations and pursue its goals.Hitler, p. 123. Hitler had not traveled abroad or read extensively, and as such, his foreign policy grew out of his domestic concerns.Weinberg, p. 1. Foreign policy's ultimate goal was the sustenance of its people and so domestic concerns were tightly connected and complementary to foreign policy initiatives.Hitler, p38. Thus, the traditional separation of domestic and foreign policy do not apply in the same way to German policy under the National Socialists. The domestic situation informed foreign policy goals, and foreign policy requirements demanded certain domestic organization and mobilization.Weinberg, p. 358. It is clear, however, that what appears as opportunism in the conduct of Nazi foreign policy was actually the result of plans conceived well before Hitler assumed power, in line with his long-term theories of political vitality based on historical experience.Weinberg, p. 2. Hitler idolized Germany in the times of Bismarck's Prussia, before the democratic Reich botched treaties and alliances, ultimately undermining German ethnic goals.Hitler, p. 69. Bismarck succeeded in giving Germany a suitably \\"organic\\" state, such that the German race could realize its \\"right to life\\".Hitler, p. 60. Bismarck achieved prestige for Germany by uniting the varied German states into the Reich, but he was unable to unite the whole German nation or pursue a truly ethnic foreign policy.Hitler, pp. 52–54. Hitler perceived the Reich's rallying cry of peace as giving it no goal, consistency or stability in foreign policy, allowing it no options to take aggressive steps to realize the goals.Hitler, p. 120. He cites the warning of the Pan-German League against the \\"disastrous\\" policy of the Wilheminian period.Hitler, p. 41. The borders of the Reich were inherently unstable in his opinion, allowing for easy avenues of attack by hostile powers, with no natural geographic barriers for protection and incapable of feeding the German people.Hitler, pp. 54–55. His central criticism of the Reich was that it failed to unify the German people and or to pursue a policy that would solve the agricultural problem, in lieu of policies aimed at attaining international prestige and recognition.Hitler, p. 56. The Weimar government, which could do no good in Hitler's eyes, was centrally responsible for the treasonous act of signing the Treaty of Versailles, which he held crippled Germany and placed it at the mercy of hostile powers. In fact, Versailles had not significantly weakened Germany, as it still had the largest population in Europe, with skilled workers and substantial resources. Russia, which Bismarck had feared and allied with Austro-Hungary against, had been defeated in World War I and then underwent a destabilizing revolution. Austria-Hungary itself had been divided into a number of small weak states. Germany was in a relatively if not absolutely, better position than most other states after World War I.Weinberg, pp. 357–358. == Overview == Hitler's National Socialist foreign policy contained four broad goals (racial unification, agricultural autarky, lebensraum in the East) culminating in a Eurasian land-based empire. Not justified by strategic or realpolitik considerations, Hitler's ideas stemmed almost exclusively from his conception of racial struggle and the natural consequences of the need for German expansion. The historical record shows that German geopoliticians, among them chiefly General Karl Haushofer, were in contact with and taught Nazi officials, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Konstantin von Neurath. Furthermore, Nazi leaders used the language of geopolitik, along with Haushofer's maps, and reasoning in their public propaganda. How receptive they were to the true intent of Haushofer's geopolitik and what that intent was exactly are unclear. The ideas of racial organic states, Lebensraum and autarky clearly found their way into Hitler's thinking, and pan-regions and the landpower-seapower dichotomy did not appear prominently, much less correctly, in National Socialist strategy. Examination of Germany's pre-World War I imperial aims demonstrates that many of the ideas which would later surface in Nazi thought were not novel but simply continuations of the same revisionist strategic aims. Racially motivated autarky, achieved by annexation, especially in the East, found its way into National Socialist policy as a continuous and coherent whole. However, Hitler, along with the geopoliticians, would drop the imperial focus on industry, trade and naval power. The practical outcomes of imperial, geostrategic, and Nazi foreign policy plans were all largely the same. == See also == * Geojurisprudence * Mitteleuropa * Mittelafrika == References == * Beukema, Col.

He serves as the technology and computer expert of the team. * Shalimar Fox (Victoria Pratt) is a recombination of human and animal DNA – a Feline Feral – giving her great strength and agility, healing ability, and superhuman senses. After further mutation, she develops a sixth sense which allows her to anticipate incoming danger to herself. Adam found her starving and frightened in a sleazy motel. Like all Feline Ferals, Shalimar is extremely territorial, has a heightened fear of fire, and is immune to hypnosis. * Emma DeLauro (Lauren Lee Smith) is a Tele-Empath who can sense, project and manipulate the emotions of those around her. She has limited precognition, and also has the ability to induce hallucinations into the minds of others by drawing upon their own emotions. Emma later developed the power to project blasts of pure psychic energy which she uses to knock her opponents unconscious, alter and erase memories, and even kill. Before Adam Kane found her, DeLauro sold clothes and used her control of emotions to become a successful businesswoman. Initially resistant to joining Mutant X, she eventually developed an attachment to Brennan Mulwray. DeLauro was killed in an explosion at Naxcon Corporation Industries (Nicholas Fox's company). (seasons 1–2) * Brennan Mulwray (Victor Webster) is an Elemental Electrical with the ability to generate electricity, enough to power a small city. He can shoot electrical bolts from his hands which, if fired downward, are capable of launching him high into the air. His primary weakness is water, which causes him to short circuit. Before Adam Kane found Mulwray, he was a thief. Mason Eckhart captured him and used him to hunt down the other New Mutants. However, Mulwray escaped and managed to join Mutant X along with Emma DeLauro. * Adam Kane (John Shea) is the strategist and moral center of Mutant X. Head chief bio-geneticist of the scientific experiments that led to the creation of the New Mutants, Kane created Mutant X to atone for his mistakes. The group seeks to protect New Mutants and help them control their powers. Viewing the New Mutants as his responsibility, Kane is looking for treatments for their various conditions. To this end, Kane has stolen The Creator's database, which can be used to track other New Mutants. (seasons 1–2; recurring, season 3) * Lexa Pierce (Karen Cliche) was the first member added to the original Mutant X team. As a Chromatic Molecular, she can bend light to make herself and anything she is touching temporarily invisible. In addition, she can shoot beams of light from her fingertips and can project blinding flashes. She is searching for her long lost brother, and her methods and motives leave her untrusted by her teammates. (season 3) ===Recurring=== * Mason Eckhart (Tom McCamus) is the former head of security of Genomex and the current head of the Genetic Security Agency (GSA). After an accident involving Adam and the production of the New Mutants, Eckhart's immune system has been severely weakened, forcing him to wear a white wig, synthetic skin, and thick gloves. He formed the GSA to protect the public from what he deemed as a threat from the New Mutants, capturing them to perform further genetic testing to find a \\"cure\\". He is put into stasis after being double crossed by one of his agents and Dr. Harrison, allowing Ashlocke to rise to power. Some time before the season 2 finale, he has escaped his imprisonment and convinced Shalimar's father to fund his research to cure himself, but he is ultimately killed by Brennan. * Dr. Kenneth Harrison (Andrew Gillies) is a biogeneticist working for Tricorp Botanicals, and a former employee of Genomex. Eckhart seeks him out to produce a mind-controlling toxin from the plants he studies so he can create New Mutants under his own control. He continues to work with the GSA, but ultimately double-crosses Eckhart to allow Ashlocke to take control of Genomex. * Gabriel Ashlocke (Michael Easton) is \\"Patient Zero\\" of the New Mutants. He possesses the abilities of all known kinds of New Mutants, particularly the Mutant X team. In the past, Adam was hired by Genomex to attempt to hamper the young Ashlocke's powers and psychopathy, but he failed to prevent the boy from killing his parents in a powerful rage and only damaged the young boy's genome. To prevent his death, Ashlocke was put in stasis, only to be freed by a member of the GSA to usurp Eckhart's power. Ashlocke takes his revenge against Adam and Mutant X in his attempts to prevent his own death, but is ultimately unsuccessful. However, his loyal followers known as the Links used the genetic material of four similarly powered New Mutants, including Brennan, to produce a child that would effectively be Ashlocke's second coming. However, another New Mutant whose DNA was used to make this child took the boy into her own care to raise him to be a kind person instead of the monster Ashlocke turned out to be. (seasons 1–2) * Lexa's Dominion contact (George Buza) is the liaison between Lexa and the organization known as The Dominion, as she and the remaining Mutant X team work for The Dominion to solve New Mutant-related mysteries and crimes. (season 3) ==Episodes== ==Home media== ADV Films released all three seasons on DVD in region 1 in 2004 and 2005. In late 2008, a complete series collection was scheduled to be released by ADV Films, but it was later cancelled. In 2008, Beyond Home Entertainment also re-released each season for region 4. In 2010, Alliance Home Entertainment re-released each season on DVD in Canada. Season 1 was released on August 31, 2010, season 2 on September 28, 2010, and season 3 on October 26, 2010. In region 2, Revelation Films released all three seasons individually on March 25, 2013. On June 20, 2016, they released a complete series set on DVD in the UK. On October 24, 2016, Revelation Films released a region free complete series Blu-ray set. Lionsgate Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on February 26, 2019. ==Comic book tie-in== In May 2002, Marvel Comics released a tie-in comic called Mutant X: Origin, which chronicled the early life of Adam Kane. In the story, Adam and a friend Paul did research on the DNA of the mustard plant in college that drew the attention of the U.S. government, who offered them the Genomex company to work on a cure to genetic diseases. During this story, Eckhart is exposed to radiation, which leads to his vulnerability to diseases. ==Lawsuits== On April 15, 2001, 20th Century Fox sued Marvel, Tribune Entertainment, and Fireworks Entertainment for breach of their licensing agreement and false advertisement. Fox stated it had exclusive rights from Marvel to develop the X-Men property, and anything similar was an infringement. Fox claimed that Mutant X was too similar to X-Men, and Mutant X was being advertised as an \\"X-Men replacement.\\" Marvel countersued Fox, saying that the two were dissimilar and asking the courts to allow Mutant X production to go forward. Production was allowed, as long as X-Men material was not used in the promotion of Mutant X. On March 9, 2003, Fox and Marvel resolved their differences in a confidential settlement of their suits. Meanwhile, Fox continued to pursue their case against Tribune and Fireworks. Tribune sued Marvel for fraud and breach of contract, claiming Marvel encouraged Tribune to connect Mutant X to the X-Men, misrepresented what they were getting in their license, and caused millions in losses due to the need to alter storylines and characters to ensure the mandated distance between Mutant X and X-Men, as well as fighting Fox's litigation. In November 2005, the dispute was settled in private. ==References== == External links == * * Category:2000s American science fiction television series Category:2001 American television series debuts Category:2004 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian science fiction television series Category:2001 Canadian television series debuts Category:2004 Canadian television series endings Category:ADV Films Category:English-language television shows Category:First-run syndicated television shows in Canada Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Superhero television shows Category:Television series about genetic engineering Category:Television series by Tribune Entertainment Category:Television series produced in Toronto ","title":"Mutant X (TV series)"},{"id":"1422891","text":"Streptophyta, informally the streptophytes (from the Greek strepto, for twisted, i.e., the morphology of the sperm of some members), is a clade of plants.

It airs programming related to food, cooking, cuisine, and the food industry. The Canadian version of Food Network is a joint venture between Corus Entertainment and the American network's parent company Television Food Network, G.P. (which is majority-owned by Discovery Inc.). ==History== The American Food Network was available in Canada since 1997 and became one of the more popular foreign cable channels available in Canada. This prompted the creation of a Canadian version which would then be able to access ad revenue through commercials under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations. Corus Entertainment and Alliance Atlantis launched the channel on October 9, 2000. Food Network's logo used from 2000 to 2005. After that it was changed to match the 2003 Food Network USA logo. The licence for Food Network Canada was approved by the CRTC in early 2000. The channel was launched in October of that year; on the day of the launch, the American service was removed from the list of foreign channels eligible to be broadcast in Canada. On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media bought Alliance Atlantis and gained AAC's interest in Food Network.

A younger brother of George Armstrong Custer, he served as his aide at the Battle of Little Bighorn against the Lakota and Cheyenne in the Montana Territory. Together with the younger Boston Custer, the three brothers were killed in that overwhelming defeat of United States forces. ==Early life and Civil War== Studio portrait of George Armstrong Custer, Thomas Ward Custer and Elizabeth Bacon Custer, c. 1865 Thomas Custer was born in New Rumley, Ohio, the third son of Emanuel and Marie Custer. The paternal line was of ethnic German descent. He enlisted in the Union Army, in September 1861, at age 16, and served in the early campaigns of the Civil War as a private in the 21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He saw action at numerous battles, including Stones River, Missionary Ridge and the Atlanta Campaign. He mustered out in October 1864 as a corporal. Commissioned a second lieutenant in Company B of the 6th Michigan Cavalry, he became aide-de-camp to his brother George Armstrong Custer and accompanied him throughout the last year of the war. Custer distinguished himself by winning successively the brevets of captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, although he was barely 20 years of age when the Civil War ended. He was awarded two Medals of Honor. He was the first soldier to receive the dual honor, one of only four soldiers or sailors to receive the dual honor during the Civil War, and one of just 19 in history. ==Medals of Honor== Thomas W. Custer received the Medal of Honor twice for gallantry for his actions during the American Civil War Both actions that earned Custer the Medal of Honor involved capturing Confederate regimental flags (2nd North Carolina Cavalry flag at Namozine Church on April 3, 1865, and again at Sailor's Creek on April 6, 1865).http://www.history.army.mil/moh/civilwar_af.html#COHN Such battle flags \\"denoted individual persons, or units, on the field of battle. The flag symbolized the honor of the regiment...In combat, with the field full of noise and smoke, the soldiers watched their regimental flag and if it advanced or retreated they followed. The names of the battles that the regiment participated in were sometimes stitched onto the flag. The loss of a regimental flag was a disgrace to the command.\\" ===First award=== Custer earned his first Medal of Honor for actions during the Battle of Namozine Church, April 3, 1865.see heading date of actions Among Union forces charging Confederate barricades, Custer had his horse leap a barricade while coming under fire. The Confederates fell back in confusion before him, while he saw a color bearer. Racing forward he seized the flag of the Second North Carolina cavalry from the bearer and commanded those around him to surrender. He took three officers and eleven enlisted men as prisoner, took them back behind the federal column, and requisitioned another horse, as his had been shot during the charge. ===Second award=== Similar actions in the Battle of Sailor's Creek resulted in Custer being the first American soldier to receive two Medals of Honor. Riding alongside Colonel Charles E. Capehart when the command to charge was given, he raced his horse toward the enemy barricades through a line of rifle fire, then leapt the barricade to be surrounded by the enemy. He discharged his pistol to both sides, scattering the enemy. He noticed Confederates attempting to make a new battleline and saw the color bearer they were rallying to. Custer charged the bearer. Colonel Capehart reported the rest of the events in a letter to Libbie Custer: (Pictures taken shortly after the battle show a scar \\"with minor soft tissue damage to his lower jaw extending to a point just below the right ear\\"; though the wound to Tom's face was across blood-rich tissue and covered him in his own blood, had the bullet gone through the mouth or the soft tissue of the neck it would have likely struck a major vessel and have caused him to bleed to death.) Having captured the flag Custer held it aloft and rode back to the Union column. An officer of the Third New Jersey cavalry, seeing Custer ride back with the banner flapping, tried to warn him that he might be shot by his own side: \\"For God's sake, Tom, furl that flag or they'll fire on you!\\" Custer ignored him and kept riding towards his brother Armstrong's personal battle flag and handed the captured flag to one of Armstrong's aides while declaring, \\"Armstrong, the damned rebels shot me, but I've got my flag.\\" Custer turned his horse to rejoin the battle, but Armstrong (who had only seconds before seen another of his aides be shot in the face and fall from his horse dead) ordered Custer to report to the surgeon. Tom ignored the order and his brother placed him under arrest, ordering him to the rear under guard. ===Date of actions=== Until 1948, official references for the date of actions for which Thomas Custer was awarded the Medal of Honor were listed as April 2 and 6, 1865. However, that year a U.S. Army book on Medal of Honor citations listed the dates as May 11, 1863, and April 6, 1865.The Medal of Honor of the United States Army, Government Printing Officer, Washington, 1948. Consolidated lists of all Medal of Honor citations were published by the U.S. Senate in 1963, 1973, and 1979 with the incorrect first date of May 11, 1863; and in 1963 and 1973 with the correct second date of April 6, 1865. The 1979 edition published the second date as April, 1865, and this would seem to be why the online Army Medal of Honor citations at United States Army Center of Military History has two incorrect dates. The Civil War Army recipient who follows Thomas Custer alphabetically is Byron Cutcheon, whose date of action was May 10, 1863. This may explain how the first date of action for Thomas Custer appeared as May 10, 1863. ==Indian Wars== Following the war, Custer was appointed first lieutenant in the 7th Cavalry in 1866. He was wounded in the Washita campaign of the Indian Wars, in November 1868. He later served with the Army during the Reconstruction era, assigned to keep the peace in South Carolina. He participated in the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, where he fought in the Battle of Honsinger Bluff, and the Black Hills Expedition of 1874. Custer was appointed captain in 1875 and given command of Company C of the 7th Cavalry. In 1874, at the trading post at Standing Rock Agency, Custer participated in the arrest of chief Rain-in-the-Face (Lakota), suspected in the 1873 murder of Dr. John Honsinger. During the 1876 Little Bighorn campaign of the Black Hills War, he served as aide-de-camp to his older brother Lt. Col. George A. Custer and died with his brother on June 25, 1876. Lt. Henry Harrington actually led Company C during the battle. George and Thomas' younger brother, Boston Custer, also died in the fighting, as did other Custer relatives and friends. It was widely rumored that Rain-in-the-Face, who had escaped from captivity and participated at the Little Bighorn, cut out Tom Custer's heart after the battle. The chief denied it later during an interview. Custer's corpse was so badly mutilated that the remains were identified only by a recognizable tattoo of his initials on his arm. Tom Custer was first buried on the battlefield. He was exhumed with other soldiers the next year and reburied in Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. A stone memorial slab marks the place where his body was discovered and initially buried. ==Possible Cheyenne descendants== George Custer was alleged (by Captain Frederick Benteen, chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral tradition) to have unofficially married Mo-nah-se-tah, daughter of the Cheyenne chief Little Rock, in the winter or early spring of 1868–1869.Utley, Robert M. (2001). Cavalier in Buckskin: George Armstrong Custer and the Western Military Frontier, revised edition. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press. , p. 107. Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Battle of Washita, in which her father was killed. Cheyenne oral history tells that she bore a second child fathered by Custer in late 1869. Some historians believe that George Custer had become sterile after contracting gonorrhea while at West Point, and that the father of these children was his brother Thomas.Wert (1996), pp. 287–288. ==See also== *List of Medal of Honor recipients *List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A–F ==References== ==Bibliography== : * ==External links== *Thomas and George Custer Tobacco Return for 7th Cavalry, 1875, Shapell Manuscript Foundation * Category:1845 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Union Army soldiers Category:Union Army officers Thomas Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:People from Harrison County, Ohio Category:United States Army officers Category:People of Ohio in the American Civil War Category:People of Michigan in the American Civil War Category:People of the Great Sioux War of 1876 Category:American military personnel killed in the American Indian Wars Category:Michigan Brigade Category:American Civil War recipients of the Medal of Honor Category:Battle of the Little Bighorn Category:Double Recipients of the Medal of Honor ","title":"Thomas Custer"},{"id":"1422914","text":"Longarone is a town and comune on the banks of the Piave in the province of Belluno, in northeast Italy. It is situated from Belluno. 4,642 people work all together in Longarone, which is 112.62% of the total population, with most actual inhabitants working within the village. ==Geography== The town is located on a road linking Belluno to Cortina d'Ampezzo, close to the borders of Veneto with Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Its nearest villages are Castellavazzo, Casso and Erto. ==History== There is evidence of Roman presence in the site of Longarone. In the regions of Fortogna and Pirago tombs have been discovered, and at Dogna, a burial site with coins, rings, bracelets, clay jars and a plaque dedicated to Asclepius, a Greco-Roman god (demigod) of medicine. Remains of a Roman road were also found. But the early story of the city is not clear until the establishment of the municipality by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806. In the Middle Ages and modern era, the city was subject to the social and political events taking place in Belluno, being dominated by several groups and families, such as the Vescovi, the Ezzelino Romano in 1250, the Scala family in 1300, the families of Carrara and Visconti and the Venetian State domination in 1420. Longarone was the site of a battle in World War I, in which a few companies of German troops led by Erwin Rommel successfully captured an entire Italian division of over 10,000, retreating after the Battle of Kobarid (Caporetto). Rommel was awarded his Pour le Mérite medal for this achievement. == Dam disaster == Pre- (1960) and post-flood LongaroneThe village was destroyed in the Vajont Dam disaster on October 9, 1963, when a landslide from Monte Toc forced 50 million cubic metres (1,800 million cu ft) of water over the top of the Vajont Dam. Longarone lay in the immediate path of the wave of mud and water which swept into the valley below. 1,909 villagers were killed. The new town Longarone was rebuilt following the tragedy and is now once again a thriving community. The fortieth anniversary of the disaster was marked, in October 2003, by a commemorative ceremony in Longarone attended by President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. ==Twin towns== * Urussanga, Brazil * Bagni di Lucca, Italy == References == == External links == * Longarone official site Category:Cities and towns in Veneto ","title":"Longarone"},{"id":"1422916","text":"Richmond Valley is the name of a neighborhood located on the South Shore of Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, the largest city in the United States.

A Lisowczyk may be the subject of one of the Dutch master's greatest works. Though the rider's identity is not known, one theory is that it is a portrait of Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Marcjan Aleksander Oginski, made in c.1655. It has little to do with the Lisowczycy, though much of the clothing and war gear would have been similar that worn by the real Lisowczyks of 30 years earlier. Lisowczyk – painting by Juliusz Kossak, circa 1860-65, after Rembrandt. Lisowczycy (; also known as Straceńcy ('lost men' or 'forlorn hope') or chorągiew elearska (company of ); or in singular form: Lisowczyk or elear) – the name of an early 17th-century irregular unit of the Polish–Lithuanian light cavalry. The Lisowczycy took part in many battles across Europe and the historical accounts of the period characterized them as extremely agile, warlike, and bloodthirsty. Their numbers varied with time, from a few hundreds to several thousands. Lisowczycy (Archery) – painting by Józef Brandt 1885 The origin of the group can be traced to konfederacja (a form of semi-legal mutiny of royal forces, practiced in the Kingdom of Poland and then in the Commonwealth), organized around 1604 by Aleksander Józef Lisowski. They began to grow in strength and fame a few years later, when Lisowski's irregulars were incorporated into the forces fighting in Muscovy. The Lisowczycy unit of the Polish cavalry received no formal wages; instead, they were allowed to loot and plunder as they pleased. They relied on their speed and fought without tabors, foraging supplies from lands they moved through. The Lisowczycy were feared and despised by civilians wherever they passed and they gained dubious fame for the scores of atrocities they carried out (pillage, rape, murder and other outrages). However, they were also grudgingly respected by their opponents for their military skills. They did not hesitate to plunder even their homeland, where they sacked the Racovian Academy university of the Polish brethren. Such actions were among the reasons the Commonwealth ruler Sigismund III Vasa tried to keep them away from the Commonwealth for as long as possible. The Lisowczycy took part in many conflicts, including the Dymitriads (where their actions help explain the text of the infamous placard in Zagorsk: three plagues: typhus, Tatars, and Poles) and in the Battle of White Mountain (where they were essential in lifting the Transylvanian siege of Vienna and Bohemia's defeat). They were eventually disbanded in 1635. An account of Lisowczycy's exploits was written by their chaplain, Wojciech Dembołęcki (or Wojciech Debolecki), in Przewagi Elearów polskich co ich niegdy Lisowczykami zwano (1619–1623) (Deeds of Polish Elears once known as Lisowczycy (1619–1623)). Lisowczycy at the inn – painting by Józef Brandt == Prologue: the konfederacja == In 1604, during the early stages of the Polish–Swedish War, the Sejm of the Commonwealth failed to gather the money to pay its soldiers fighting in Livonia against the Swedes. Aleksander Józef Lisowski became one of the leaders of the resulting konfederacja – a section of the army that mutinied and decided to gather its outstanding wages by pillaging local civilians, not caring whether these owed their allegiance to the Commonwealth or to Sweden. Although this annoyed Great Hetman of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, and resulted in Lisowski being banished from the Commonwealth, little was done to stop the mutineers. Soon after, Lisowski with his followers joined the Sandomierz rebellion or rokosz of Zebrzydowski, a revolt against the absolutist tendencies of the King Sigismund III Vasa. == Trial of Blood: the Dymitriad == Eventually, after the rebel forces were defeated at the Battle of Guzow, Lisowski's fortunes turned for the worse and he became persona non grata in most of the Commonwealth, and was forced to seek refuge with the powerful Radziwiłł family. In the meantime, Muscovy's Time of Troubles were brewing, and Lisowski did not pass over the opportunity of profiting from this, as many other local magnates and noblemen already had, by meddling in Russian affairs. He soon decided he could profit best by lending his support to the Muscovite pretender, False Dmitriy II. In 1608, together with Aleksander Kleczkowski, leading his forces – a band of few hundred ragtag soldiers of fortune, mainly Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians – he defeated the armies of tsar Vasili Shuisky, led by Zakhary Lyapunov and Ivan Khovansky, near Zaraysk and captured Mikhailov and Kolomna, moving on to blockade Moscow. However, he was soon to be defeated at Miedźwiedzi Bród, losing most of his loot. He reorganized the army and joined with Jan Piotr Sapieha, but they failed to capture the Troitse-Sergieva Lavra fortress and were forced to retreat to near Rakhmantsevo. Then came successful pillages at Kostroma, Soligalich, and some other cities (those battles took place around 1608–09). He took Pskov in 1610 and clashed with Swedes operating in Muscovy during the Ingrian War. The Lisowczycy proved essential in the defence of Smolensk in 1612, when most of the Commonwealth regular army, the (wojsko kwarciane), mutined and joined the Rohatyn Confederation. For the next three years Lisowski's forces were of importance in the guarding of the Commonwealth border against Muscovy incursions. In 1615, Lisowski gathered many outlaws and invaded Muscovy with 6 companies of cavalry. He besieged Bryansk and defeated the Muscovite relief force of a few thousand soldiers under Kniaz Yuri Shakhovskoy near Karachev. Lisowski moved on to defeat the Muscovite advance guard of a force (several times larger than his) under the command of Kniaz Dmitry Pozharsky, who decided to not to attack and fortified his forces inside a camp. Lisowski's men broke contact with other forces, burned Belyov and Likhvin, took Peremyshl, turned north, defeated a Muscovite army at Rzhev, turned towards the Kara Sea coast, then to Kashin, burned Torzhok, returned to Commonwealth without any further contact with Muscovy forces. Until the autumn of 1616, Lisowski and his forces remained on the Commonwealth-Muscovy border, when Lisowski suddenly fell ill and died on October 11. == Lisowski's soldiers in Northern Russia (1612–13) == In 1612, when the Polish occupation of the Moscow Kremlin had ended (see Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)), loose Polish forces, which had fought under Lisowski, scattered over vast territory of the Tsardom of Russia, taking advantage of the so-called Time of Troubles. Exact whereabouts of Aleksander Jozef Lisowski at that time are unknown: the legendary leader most likely roamed across northern Russia, together with his men. After Russian recapture of Moscow, most of the Polish brigands headed to the area of Vologda. On September 22, 1612, the town was captured, looted and burned by the invaders commanded by Colonel Andrzej Nalewajko, who returned in December 13 of the same year. On December 16, Poles burned the Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery, located near Vologda. On July 10, 1612, Poles captured Belozersk without fight. The town was looted, and its governor fled to Kirillov, hiding in the fortified Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. Lisowski's men reached the monastery on August 20, but its siege did not begin until December 1612. Since Polish brigands, numbered at some 3000 men, did not have any artillery, they failed to capture the abbey with its stone walls. On December 12–15, 1612, a unit of Bobowski three times tried to capture the town of Kargopol, located on the left bank of the Onega River. On January 25, 1613, Poles led by Jakub Jacki attacked the town of Veliky Ustyug, but without success. In search of food and booty, Lisowski's soldiers moved further northwards, reaching as far as Yemetsk on the Yemtsa River, Solvychegodsk, Kholmogory, and Arkhangelsk. Solvychegodsk was captured and looted on January 22, 1613. The brigands stayed in the town for three days, and then headed towards Yemetsk, which is located 150 kilometers from Arkhangelsk. Its residents, aware of the danger, managed to fortify the town and arm themselves. The \\"Lithuanians\\", as they were commonly called, tried to attack the town from the Northern Dvina, but were repelled. A battle ensued, in which two Russian traitors were captured, and sent to Kholmogory, where they warned residents of a planned attack. The brigands, numbering some 1200 and commanded by Stanislaw Jasinski, appeared at Kholmogory on December 6, 1613. Again, they failed to capture the town, and decided to head to Arkhangelsk, which they unsuccessfully besieged between December 14–19, 1613. Jasinski and his soldiers then marched towards the Northern Dvina estuary and the White Sea shore. There, they captured Severodvinsk and burned Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery, after which they ransacked local villages, reaching as far as Karelia. == Death of Lisowski, birth of the Lisowczycy == Lisowczycy on the Rhein River The name of Lisowczycy was carried by the troops ever since Lisowski's passing. Despite his death, they remained a most significant threat: in 1616 they captured Kursk and defeated Russian forces at Bolkhov, in 1617 relieved Smolensk from a Muscovite siege – the invading troops retreated to Bely as soon as they received news that the Lisowczycy, then under the command of Stanisław Czapliński, were in the neighbourhood. When Czapliński died at Kaluga, Lisowczycy elected Walenty Rogowski for the new commander. They accompanied Władysław's forces in 1617, and while he retreated, they are said to have moved inland as far as the Ob River, where they were are shown to have been impressed by a giant golden statue (possibly a Buddha, but also attachable to the Zlota Baba myth). == Devils in the Holy Empire == Lisowczyk. Another modern impression, after Rembrandt's famous picture. Painting by Dariusz T. Wielec. From 1619, the Lisowczycy, then stationed near Kaunas (Kowno) were sent by Zygmund III Vasa to aid Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor against the Protestants in the Thirty Years' War. Under the command of Walenty Rogowski, they defeated Transylvanian forces under George I Rákóczi at the Battle of Zavada and/or Battle of Humenné in November of that year. After the victory, they engaged in their traditional pastime (as they were not paid and they were obliged to gain everything by their own), plundering nearby lands, 'killing even children and dogs', as contemporary chroniclers recorded. It was around that time that they gained their new nickname: Riders of the Apocalypse. Then Lisowczycy split: part of them, with Rogowski, decided to return to Poland, pillaging Slovakia on their way. Others, under Jarosz Kleczkowski, remained in the service of the Emperor for the next few years. After the death of Kleczkowski (March 4, 1620) at the Battle of Krems, Stanisław Rusinowski became the new commander of the Lisowczycy. Under Rusinowski, the Lisowczycy took part in the Battle of White Mountain (November 8) where they captured twenty standards. On May 7, 1621, the Emperor paid them their outstanding wages and released them from service, due to numerous complaints about their behaviour. Some of them returned to Poland, others served under Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. == Cecora and Chocim (Khotyn) == The Lisowczycy fought in the wars between Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire, not least in the last phase of the Polish magnates' wars in Moldavia. * Battle of Cecora * Battle of Chocim == Epilogue == After the conflict with the Ottomans was settled, many Lisowczycy, then under the command of Stanisław Stroynowski, were taken into German employment during the mayhem of the Thirty Years' War, mostly in support of the Roman Catholic Emperor, against his Protestant enemies. Their indiscipline and pillaging became legendary, and they devastated the nearby German lands of the Holy Roman Empire, especially Silesia. The local population often believed it was being attacked by Tatar hordes or non-European barbarians. Eventually, after the French declined to employ Lisowczycy mercenaries, and other sides of the conflict turned them down as well, in 1622 Stroynowski decided to officially disband the unit and return to the Commonwealth. However, the Lisowczycy proved to be a pestilence wherever they went, and soon most of its members formed bandit groups, pillaging the Commonwealth and German countryside and burning down the town of Radomsko. Condemned by the szlachta and by many sejmiks, they were increasingly hunted down by local government forces and militias. Stroynowski's group was destroyed in 1624, and he himself was executed two years later. The last time that companies using the Lisowczycy name took part in a major war was during the late 1620s, when they were temporarily reformed to fight in Poland's continuing conflict against the Swedes in Polish Prussia, yet another stage of the Polish–Swedish War – the same conflict that set Aleksander Lisowski on the path to forming the unit that was to bear his name. These Lisowczycy were finally disbanded by an act of the Sejm, in 1636. Even after the formation was disbanded, its members were respected (or at least, feared) even beyond the Commonwealth. Soon, their atrocities were forgotten and their exploits as the defenders of the Commonwealth and faith against the Orthodox, Protestants and Muslims turned them into a legend which lives on to this day. == Sources == * Lisowczycy nad oceanem Lodowatym.Opowieść o św.

It is situated north west of the city of Wolverhampton. Which it forms part of the boundary of the Staffordshire and West Midlands County border although along with Perton it is built up around Wolverhampton. ==History== In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded six people in Codsall. They were probably the heads of households so the population would have been a little larger. Toponymists have the name Codsall coming from the old English 'Cod's Halh' – meaning a nook of land belonging to a man named Cod (Cod being an early English personal name, possibly in shortened form).'Notes On Staffordshire Place Names' by W. H. Duignan (1902) The Church of St. Nicholas is the oldest building. It has a Norman doorway thought to date from the 11th century. Since medieval times, the area around the church, on the top of the hill, was the hub of the village with a windmill, village pond, forge, bakery and public house. The administration of the village would have been conducted from the church through the decisions of the vestry. Agriculture was the mainstay of the village and even now the strip-field system of cultivation can be seen to the west and north-east of St Nicholas' church. Church Street, now called Church Road, lies between the road junction and the church. There was a significant change after Codsall railway station, on the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, opened in 1849. The station became the commercial hub of the village with a goods yard, coal yard and cattle pens. Development took place along Station Road and beyond with some substantial properties being built to accommodate wealthy businessmen from Wolverhampton and the Black Country. Gradually the focus of activity changed from the area around the church and the station to the crossroads or 'Square'. Emphasis on the Square was increased after 1900 when Baker's Nurseries expanded on the site of Old Hall Farm in Church Street. The growth of public transport, with a terminus for buses to Wolverhampton in the Square, the coming of electricity and the digging of the deep sewer all in the 1920s, helped to change the function of the village from an agricultural centre into a dormitory for Wolverhampton. This has been reflected in the development of several housing estates, new schools and improved roads. ==Present day== Bilbrook and Codsall Community Fire Station, on Duck Lane, Codsall, in October 2015 Codsall has expanded since World War II, forming the largest part of three adjoining villages (the others being Bilbrook and Oaken). It is the site of the headquarters of South Staffordshire District Council. It is twinned with the French commune of Saint-Pryvé-Saint-Mesmin. The village also has a cricket club called Codsall Cricket Club (Codsall CC), the club was established in 1897 and plays at the Village Hall. There is also a 3-par, 18 hole golf course (The Ledene). In the village, Codsall Community High School runs a post-16 Football Academy for their students. The main shopping area around The Square has a variety of shops including a local wine shop. Another shopping area is around Birches Bridge, where the shops include a branch of The Co-operative Food. Although not part of the city of Wolverhampton. Codsall along with neighbouring villages Perton, Wombourne, Himley, Swindon, Featherstone and Ettingston form part of a built up area of South Staffordshire around the West Midlands County (Wolverhampton and Dudley) and Shropshire (Cosford and Albrighton). ==Education== Codsall Community High School is the only high school in the area and it has three feeder middle schools; Codsall Middle School, Bilbrook Middle School and Perton Middle School. There are also three first schools; Lane Green First School, St. Nicholas' C of E and Birches First School. St Christopher's Roman Catholic Primary School is the only primary school in the area. Codsall Community High School was judged to be good by Ofsted in November 2013. ==Public houses== Codsall has several pubs, bars and members' clubs. The oldest is The Crown Joules in Codsall Square, renamed from the Crown in 2015 following the purchase of the site by Joules Brewery. The Crown was briefly named 'Butlers Bar & Bistro' in 2008, but reverted to 'The Crown' in 2009. Also in Codsall Square is The Bull, another traditional old pub serving ale with an extensive lunchtime food menu. There is also the award- winning Codsall Station on the corner of Chapel Lane & Oaken Lanes, a working railway station with a Holdens Brewery pub on the platform. Codsall has two social clubs, the Codsall Legionnaires club (known locally as 'the Legion'), and The Firs (formerly Codsall Conservative Club). Codsall Legionnaires club has a modern 'members bar' area. Its former function room has been acquired by the Pet Stop, a local pet shop, as approved by Codsall Parish Council in May 2011, on condition that the car park remains for public use.http://www.codsallparishcouncil.co.uk/Minutes/110525p.htm Codsall Parish Council Minutes 25 May 2011 ==Events== The first Codsall Beer Festival took place on 3 October 2015 at Codsall village hall, with over 35 real ales and ciders, many fruit wines and live music from local artists. Proceeds were donated to the Harry Will Walk charity & Codsall Community Group, a volunteer group that looks after the green spaces in Codsall, Codsall Wood and Oaken.

It is represented in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli. Ocean View Burial Park Bay Terrace is bordered by Richmondtown to the north, Oakwood to the east, Great Kills to the west, and the Great Kills Harbor to the south. ==History== The street originally named \\"Bay Terrace Avenue.\\" which is bisected by the Staten Island Railway main line. Formerly known as Whitlock, the community's main thoroughfare was originally named Bay Terrace Avenue; however, by the late 1940s the word \\"Avenue\\" had been dropped and the street's name became simply Bay Terrace. The vicinity around the street was largely undeveloped until the late 1950s, when single-family home construction began there; the area itself then acquired the name of Bay Terrace, which may refer to its flat, ramp like terrain, which gradually slopes downward to the east until reaching the Lower New York Bay in Great Kills Park. In the 1970s many Jewish families from Brooklyn and Queens settled in Bay Terrace, providing a significant demographic contrast with the surrounding communities, whose populations are still largely Italian-American, though they are becoming increasingly Russian-American as well. In recent years, many new commercial establishments -- most notably a large shopping center built on the site of a former swim club -- have sprung up to serve the area's growing population. Part of Oceanview Cemetery, originally established by the Lutheran Church but open to those of all faiths, is considered to be in Bay Terrace, which is regarded by many Staten Island geographers as the southernmost neighborhood of the East Shore, the South Shore beginning with Great Kills, which lies immediately to the south.bay terrace Retrieved August 11, 2018 ==Famous residents== Guy Molinari, an American politician who was a member of the New York State Assembly and the United States House of Representatives.

Laney is the largest of the four colleges of the Peralta Community College District, which serves northern Alameda County. Laney College is named after Joseph Clarence Laney. The college offers both certificates and credits for Associate of Arts degree, as well as prerequisites to transfer to four year universities. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. ==History== Laney College traces its history to the Central Trade School by the Oakland Board of the Education in 1927 and the Merritt School of Business (now Merritt College) founded in 1929. The trade school was later renamed Joseph C. Laney Trade and Technical Institute. Oakland Junior College was founded in 1953 with Laney serving as the vocational training center and Merritt hosting the liberal arts and business programs. In 1958 the college was renamed Oakland City College. With the establishment of the Peralta Junior College District in 1964, Laney Institute, located on the current campus, and Merritt College in Alameda became separate autonomous colleges in their present-day forms. The current campus was opened prior to 1970-71 academic year. ==Campus== Most of the college's academic and administrative buildings are clustered together in a complex in the northern corner of the campus. The buildings are arranged on a rigid grid, with two levels of concrete pathways providing circulation. The square in the center of the complex has been reserved for the quad. Surrounding the quad are the student center, theater, library, and gymnasium. On one corner is the triangular \\"Laney Tower\\", the main administration building; on the opposite is another triangular building housing a lecture hall and dance studio. Academic buildings form the outer ring of the complex. Each has a similar design, with outdoor courtyards in the centers of each square on a higher level, ringed by classrooms and offices; and more classrooms and vocational facilities on the lower level, all accessed from the perimeter of the building. However, none of the higher levels are on the same level with each other; they are connected by voluminous stairs and ramps. Most of the outer buildings occupy two or three squares on the grid. The entire complex shares a red brick and concrete theme, with sharp corners, square and triangular shapes, and little vegetation. The newest academic building is the art center, which is adjacent to the main complex but has its own architectural style. The building opened in the 2006-2007 school year. It was designed by Beverly Prior Architects to be built from prefabricated materials, because of the short time frame between the start of construction and planned opening. The channel that connects Lake Merritt to the Oakland Estuary runs through the center of the campus. The southeastern half of the campus on the other side of the channel is mainly used for athletic and Peralta Community College District facilities. This section was also the former site of the World War II \\"Auditorium Housing Project\\" which housed war industry workers from around the United States, many of whom worked in the Kaiser Shipyards. The housing was demolished sometime after the war, and in the early 1960s, a temporary football stadium called Frank Youell Field was constructed on the site for use by the Oakland Raiders. ==Athletics== ===Football=== The Laney Eagles compete in the Bay Valley Conference, which is governed by the California Community College Athletic Association. They are led by head coach John Beam, who also won the CCCAA Coach of the Year award. In the 2018 season, Laney won the CCCAA State Football Championship and was deemed the Mythical National Champion, due to the regional splits between the CCCAA, which governs all 68 California junior college football programs, and the National Junior College Athletic Association, which governs junior college athetics across the rest of the United States, and covers 65 football programs.

Iran only uses the term \\"Persian Gulf\\" and does not usually recognize the naming when it is referred to as \\"Arabian Gulf\\" or just the \\"Gulf\\" or by any other alternative. Iran does not consider the latter an impartial usage, and views it as an active contribution to the abandonment of the historical name. In a 1974 interview by Mike Wallace in 60 Minutes, the last Shah of Iran himself preferred the term \\"Persian Gulf\\" while talking to Wallace. In February 2010 Iran threatened to ban from its airspace foreign airlines, especially those from the Gulf region, who did not use the term \\"Persian Gulf\\". In 2011 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a speech to the United Nations General Assembly during which he said that the only correct name of the sea between Iran and the Arabian peninsula was the Persian Gulf, and he dismissed the use of any other names as “illegitimate and void.” Iran officially designated 30 April as National Persian Gulf Day. The date coincides with the anniversary of Abbas I of Persia's successful military campaign when the Portuguese navy was driven out of the Strait of Hormuz in the Capture of Ormuz (1622). The decision was taken by the High Council of Cultural Revolution, presided over by former President Mohammad Khatami, noting that the campaign launched in 2009 by certain Arab states to rename Persian Gulf was the driver behind the decision.\\"Iran Names Persian Gulf National Day\\" .

Abdel Khaleq al-Janabi, a Saudi Arabian historian, said \\"It's this name [Persian Gulf] that has been retained by history books and Arab historians, like Ibn Khaldoun and Ibn al Athir.

In an interview with Al Wasat, Bahraini writer Hussain al-Baharna said one of the reasons for the dispute over naming the \\"Arabian Gulf as the Persian Gulf\\" is that the Red Sea was named Arabian Gulf back then, which \\"prevented the Arabian Gulf from being named as Arabian Gulf, and instead the name Persian Gulf became common\\".

The word \\"Persian\\" is erased from the phrase \\"Persian Gulf\\". ==Viewpoint of third parties== ===United Nations=== According to the book Documents on the Persian Gulf's name (pp 92–98), the United Nations Secretariat and its specialized agencies have requested its staff to use only \\"Persian Gulf\\" as a standard geographical designation. The United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names discussed the naming issue during its 23rd session, held in Vienna from 28 March to 4 April 2006. According to the report of the meeting, \\"It is interesting that from among 6000 existing historical maps published up to 1890, there are only three maps mentioning the names of Basreh Gulf, Ghatif Gulf, and Arabic Gulf, in addition to which the name of small gulfs located at the coast with local utilization can be also named such as Chah Bahar Gulf, Siraf Gulf, Basreh Gulf, Ghatif Gulf, Bahrain Gulf,…. but such names are not applied to the entirety of the Persian Gulf. It is obvious that the promotional use by the Arabs of the three aforementioned maps, whose identity and originality are not clear, in comparison with 6000 maps and more than 200 historical and tourism books from Irastus to Herodotus to Estakhri and Ibn Houghal, who have all called the water body, Persian Gulf, shall lack any value.\\"Historical, Geographical and Legal Validity of the Name: PERSIAN GULF. Working Paper No. 61, United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, United Nations. New York, 2006.. The report further notes that \\"any change, destruction, or alteration of the names registered in historical deeds and maps is like the destruction of ancient works and is considered as an improper action. Therefore, the names of geographical features profiting from a unique historical identity, should not be utilized as political instruments in reaching a political, tribal, and racial objective, or in any clash with national interests and other's values,\\" and finally concludes \\"...it is worth mentioning that the name of Persian Gulf has been admitted in all the live languages of the world so far and all the countries throughout the world, name this Iranian Sea, just in the language of the people: Persian Gulf. Even Arab brothers do not need to alter a historical name to have a gulf of their own, because there had been a gulf in their own name previously mentioned in the historical and geographical works and drawings, which is called at present the Red Sea (Bahr Ahmar).\\" ===International Hydrographic Organization=== The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), an international body for provision of hydrographic information for worldwide marine navigation and other purposes, uses the name \\"Gulf of Iran (Persian Gulf)\\" for this body of water, in its standard S-23 (Limits of Oceans and Seas), section 41, published in 1953. ===United States=== President Obama mentioned the term Persian Gulf in his Nowruz Message to the Iranian People at 2015.«President Obama’s Nowruz Message to the Iranian People » at White House official website Retrieved: August 4, 2016. website. The United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency GEOnet Names Server (GNS) is the \\"official repository of standard spellings of all foreign place names\\" sanctioned by the Board of Geographical Names (BGN).

In Persian Gulf States Country Studies published in 1993 by the Federal Research Division of the U.S. Library of Congress, the authors follow the practise of the BGN by using \\"Persian Gulf\\" while acknowledging that the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain \\"officially reject the use of the term Persian Gulf—as do other Arab governments—and refer to that body of water as the Arabian Gulf\\". Since about 1991, due to increased cooperation with Arab states of the Persian Gulf, various branches of the United States armed forces have issued directives to their members to use the \\"Arabian Gulf\\" when operating in the area to follow local conventions (\\"Persian Gulf\\" is still used in official publications and websites).\\"Navy Causes Controversy by Changing 'Persian Gulf' to 'Arabian Gulf'\\".

The practice of the United States Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is to use \\"Arabian Gulf\\": ===Atlases and other media=== Map of Persia The National Geographic Society uses the name Persian Gulf to refer to this body of water. In 2004, the society published a new edition of its National Geographic Atlas of the World using the term \\"Arabian Gulf\\" as an alternative name (in smaller type and in parentheses) for \\"Persian Gulf\\". This resulted in heavy protests by many Iranians, especially the Internet user community and the Iranology Academy, which led to the Iranian government acting on the issue and banning the distribution of the society's publications in Iran. On 30 December 2004, the society reversed its decision and published an Atlas Update, removing the parenthetical reference and adding a note: \\"Historically and most commonly known as the Persian Gulf, this body of water is referred to by some as the Arabian Gulf.\\". National Geographic. The 2000 AP Stylebook elaborates: Persian Gulf is the \\"long- established name\\" and the best choice. \\"Some Arab nations call it the Arabian Gulf.

This was the combined efforts of hundreds of bloggers, webmasters and Persian forums who pointed links with the word Arabian Gulf to a spoof error page found at this link. Some atlases and media outlets have taken to referring to \\"The Gulf\\" without any adjectival qualification. This usage is followed by the BBC and The Times Atlas of the World. Iran does not consider this an impartial usage and views it as an active contribution to abandonment of the historical name. In June 2006, Iran banned the sale of The Economist for the above reason, after a map in the magazine labeled the Persian Gulf as \\"The Gulf\\". The magazine repeated this act in its 18 February 2010 article titled \\"Iraq, Iran and the Politics of Oil: Crude Diplomacy\\". It also used the name \\"Arabian Gulf\\" in the same article. Google had previously put both Persian Gulf and Arabian Gulf on its Google Maps. After May 2012, it removed both names from the body of water stating that it does not name every place in the world and that it did not want to take a political stance.

The Iran national football team does not take part in the Arabian Gulf Cup for national teams surrounding the waters. The top football league in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was founded in 1973 as the UAE Football League. In 2007, the name was changed to UAE Pro-League. Starting from the 2013–14 season the name was changed to UAE Arabian Gulf League, as well as their League Cup and Super Cup competitions. The name change has been viewed as a revival of the Persian Gulf naming dispute with Iran accusing the United Arab Emirates of racism, and the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran barring the transfer of Javad Nekounam to a UAE club. Similarly, the Arab Gulf Cup Football Federation was founded in 2016 for the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. ==Gallery== ===Persian Gulf or equivalent=== File:Basra-ps64.JPGBasora-Persian Sea File:Map of persia.jpgMap of Persia, Mecran File:Heinrich Kiepert.

He studied classical piano and trumpet as a child, and then taught himself to play guitar as he entered his teens. Starting out as a Hank Marvin-influenced rock guitarist with The Vanguards, Rypdal turned towards jazz in 1968 and joined Jan Garbarek's group and later George Russell's sextet and orchestra. An important step towards international attention was his participation in the free jazz festival in Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1969, where he was part of a band led by Lester Bowie. During his musical studies at Oslo university and conservatory, he led the orchestra of the Norwegian version of the musical Hair. He has often been recorded on the ECM record label, both jazz-oriented material and classical compositions (some of which do not feature Rypdal's guitar).

As an accomplished zoologist and ecologist, Allee was best known and recognized for his research on social behavior, aggregations and distributions of animals in aquatic as well as terrestrial environments.The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica. \\"Warder Clyde Allee\\", Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Retrieved on 2014-03-20. Allee attended Earlham College and upon his graduation in 1908, pursued advanced studies at the University of Chicago where he received his PhD and graduated summa cum laude in 1912. Allee’s most significant research occurred during his time at the University of Chicago and at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole in Massachusetts. His research findings led to many publications, with the most notable being Principles of Animal Ecology and Animal Aggregations. Allee was married to author Marjorie Hill Allee and remained active in the field of biology until his death in 1955 at the age of 70. ==Early life== Warder Clyde Allee was born on June 5, 1885, on a farm in Bloomingdale, Indiana to Mary Emily Newlin and John Wesley Allee. He is of French Huguenot heritage; the original surname was spelled d'Ailly.https://www.geni.com/people/Warder-Allee/6000000025590635333 He was named after his paternal grandmother, Sarah Ann Warder. His father was orphaned as a child and grew up at the homes of various relatives in the Bloomingdale region. Clyde Allee attended a one-room country school and led his class in scholarship. At Bloomingdale Academy he was again at the head of his graduating class and the winner of the oratorical contest. At the age of seventeen, he taught country school for a year and then the fifth and sixth grades in the Bloomingdale elementary school for another year. Then, at nineteen, he began his first year at Earlham College. He was a Methodist, and joined the Society of Friends to marry Marjorie Hill, whose Quaker ancestry extended back into the seventeenth century. His strong Quaker beliefs would play a large role in his research later in his academic and professional career. ==Personal life== Family background combined with the Quaker influence at Earlham College contributed to the Quaker mold in which Allee was cast. In 1912, he confirmed himself as a member of the Society of Friends in order to marry Marjorie Hill. Allee met Marjorie when she was a freshman at Earlham College while Allee was a senior. Marjorie was most interested in English Literature and Writing and would go on to help her husband in his books and scientific papers. Specifically, she served as a critic, collaborator, and joint author to the works of her husband. Eventually, she established herself as an author, with a notable series of novels for girls. ==University career== Allee was born in Bloomingdale, Indiana. He received the S.B. degree from Earlham College in 1908, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1910 and 1912, where he graduated summa cum laude. He was a student of Victor Ernest Shelford and there imbibed the ideas of ecological succession. Allee worked as an assistant professor in Zoology from 1910 to 1912. Between 1912 and 1921 he taught at the University of Illinois, Williams College, University of Oklahoma, Lake Forest College, and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1921 as an assistant professor of zoology and was promoted to professor in 1928.Allee, Warder Clyde (United States 1885–1955)\\". Western Kentucky University website. Retrieved on April 11, 2011. In addition, he served as dean in the College of Arts, Literature, and Science (1924–1926) and secretary of the Department of Zoology (1927–1934). After retirement in 1950, he worked at the University of Florida at Gainesville, where he was head professor of biology until his death in March 1955. ==Career== Allee was strongly influenced by Frank R. Lillie, head of the Department of Zoology at the University of Chicago and one of the founders of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. Allee gained interest in the interactions and patterns of the distribution of marine mammals during his time as an instructor at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole in Massachusetts from 1914 to 1921. Allee was also influenced by Peter Kropotkin's theory of mutual aid. In 1923, Allee began to write a series of papers entitled, Animal Aggregations. Eight years later, he published his findings in a book under the same name. The results of Clyde Allee's research demonstrated the existence of an unconscious drive within species for fellow individuals of the same species. This research helped to prove that under crowding was detrimental to some animals. Allee's research also helped to describe protocooperation, where two species interact with one another in a beneficial way that is not essential to the survival of either organism. It should also be noted that Allee's biological basis of democracy arrived at a time when the future of world politics and human kind's morality were in question themselves. As a Quaker, Allee was committed to world peace and this commitment anteceded his theory of sociality.Mitman, Gregg. \\"From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson.\\" Journal of the History of Biology. Oklahoma, 6 January 1988. Retrieved on 2014-03-20. Allee's Quaker beliefs led to the development of his dedication to show how cooperation is essential in the natural world. This led to the development of the Allee effect. ===Allee effect=== Allee dedicated his life to researching the benefits of organisms acting in a group rather than as individuals. Through observing groups of organisms, Allee discovered that cooperation is both beneficial and essential in nature. The Allee effect describes the positive correlation between population density and individual fitness of a population or species. ===Social Implications=== Allee's research on social aggregations and the evolution of cooperation coincided with his social activism, religious beliefs, and opposition to war. Raised as a Quaker, Allee publicly renounced war, which made him a target of harsh criticism and persecution.\\"Warder Clyde Allee\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. Retrieved on 2014-04-20. In the 1940s, Allee argued that his research on the social behaviors of animals provided clear evidence against a biological basis for war. Specifically, he believed that his theory on the sociality of organisms based on cooperation among individuals proved that war was not a natural occurrence. According to Gregg Mitman, Allee saw ecologists as \\"social healers\\" who were able to provide a naturalistic foundation for ethics through their research. ==Involvement in other scientific work== A spinal tumor caused paralysis, and Allee used a wheelchair after 1935. He nevertheless maintained a full schedule of teaching, research and writing. Allee continued to spend summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, and served as a trustee from 1932 to 1955. Having been on the editorial board of Physiological Zoology, a journal published by the University of Chicago Press, since its founding in 1928, Allee took over as managing editor in 1937 and remained in that position until his death. He also chaired the Committee on the Ecology of Animal Populations of the National Research Council which was established in 1941 to solicit and administer funds for research projects in the field. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. ==Publications== Allee's dedication to research resulted in more than 200 papers and over a dozen books, including Animal Aggregations: A Study in General Sociology (1931), Animal Life and Social Growth (1932), The Social Life of Animals (1938), Principles of Animal Ecology, co-authored by Alfred E. Emerson, Orlando Park, Thomas Park, and Karl P. Schmidt (1949), and Cooperation among Animals, with Human Implications (1951). ==Commemoration, death, and legacy== Many biologists and historians believe that Allee's reputation was diminished by the work of another ecologist, George C. Williams. Williams's work, Adaptation and Natural Selection (1996), refutes Allee's research on group cooperation by stressing the importance of individual selection and providing samples that invalidated the idea of group selection. However, the research and legacy of Allee is still recognized and discussed today as many scientists remain interested in the principles behind the Allee effect. In 1973, the Animal Behavior Society began to offer the W.C. Allee Award for the best presentation of an ethological work of research by a student in a juried competition held at their annual meeting. Allee died in Gainesville, Florida, aged 69, in 1955. ==Bibliography== *Allee, W. C. (1931). Animal Aggregations. A study in General Sociology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. *Allee, W. C.

Cecil accepts and, after Bugs takes a big lead, hurries to a telephone center, to a phone intended for turtles only, and rings up his cousins on a telephone, devises a scheme in which they will double as him at significant points along the track while he himself crosses the finish line ahead of Bugs. The plan works, with Bugs being befuddled at what looks like Cecil always being one step ahead of him. After reaching the finish line, thinking he's won, Bugs finds Cecil waiting for him, the apparent victor. Bugs, both furious and perplexed, pays Cecil his owed ten dollars. As Bugs somberly walks away, he suddenly wonders if he'd been tricked. When he turns around, Cecil and his cousins, each with one of the ten dollars in hand, say to him in unison, \\"Ehhh, it's a possibility,\\" and all of them then kiss Bugs. ==See also== * Tortoise Wins by a Hare * Rabbit Transit ==Availability== *DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, Disc One *Blu-ray/DVD - Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2, Disc Two ==ReferencesCategory:1941 films Category:1941 short films Category:1941 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:Films directed by Tex Avery Category:Running films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:American films Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Works based on fables Category:American animated short films Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Films produced by Leon Schlesinger Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ","title":"Tortoise Beats Hare"},{"id":"1423051","text":"The Lurkers are an English punk rock band from Uxbridge, West London. They are notable for being the first group ever on Beggars Banquet Records for whom they released two albums, the first of which charted in the UK Album Charts, while five singles also charted in the UK Singles Chart. ==Career== The Lurkers formed late in 1976, the original line-up consisting in Pete Stride on Guitar, Pete \\"Manic Esso\\" Haynes on drums, Pete \\"Plug\\" Edwards on vocals and Nigel Moore on bass. Edwards was replaced by Howard Wall after a few rehearsals, with him becoming the band's road manager. Stride was the band’s main songwriter. The band played their first gig at Uxbridge Technical College in December supporting Screaming Lord Sutch to an audience of 10. The band were one of the early punk bands that played live in the first few months of the Roxy Club in London. Nigel was swiftly replaced by Arturo Bassick. They supported The Jam in February 1977, Eater in March, and Slaughter & The Dogs in April.Thompson, D. (2000) Punk, Collector’s Guide Publication, Ontario, Canada, pp. 61-62 The Lurkers recorded four sessions at Maida Vale 4 studio for John Peel at BBC Radio 1, on 18/10/1977, 18/04/1978, 25/07/1978, and 24/01/1979. Their debut single \\"Shadow\\", the first release on Beggars Banquet Records, was voted by John Peel's listeners as twelfth best track of the year in 1977's Festive Fifty. with \\"Love Story\\", the B-side, at number 31. Bassick left the band after this first single, and was replaced by former Saints member Kym Bradshaw, who left before the recording of the third single, 1978's \\"Ain't Got a Clue\\"/\\"Ooh, Ooh I Love You\\" which saw the return of Nigel Moore to the band. That single was their biggest hit, reaching No. 45 on the UK singles chart. The following month, the band’s debut album, Fulham Fallout, reached No. 57 on the UK albums chart. One reviewer described it as \\"by far their best with production that really makes the guitar kick. It's sloppy and amateurish, but that's what makes it so great.\\" \\"Be My Prisoner\\", a song from the album, also appeared on Streets, a 1977 compilation album of early UK punk bands from a variety of independent record labels. In January 1979, The Lurkers’ fifth single, \\"Just Thirteen\\", was released, and in 2001 it was included in Mojo magazine’s list of the best punk rock singles of all time.Mojo (October 2001) - 100 Punk Scorchers , Issue 95, London A month after the release of this single, The Lurkers' track \\"I'm on Heat\\" appeared, alongside songs by more famous bands like The Jam and The Stranglers, on the punk compilation 20 of Another Kind (Polydor, POLS 1006). The album reached number 45 in the UK charts. Another of the band's tracks, \\"Out in the Dark\\", appeared on the follow-up 20 of Another Kind Volume 2. The band’s second album was not as well received, critically or commercially, as their debut, and the band split for a few years. Pete Stride collaborated with ‘Honest’ John Plain (of English punk band the Boys) and released an album in January 1980.Joynson, V. (2001) Up Yours!

The band broke up again in 1984.Thompson, D. (2000) Punk, Collector’s Guide Publication, Ontario, Canada, p. 83; In the years since, they have reunited with various members numerous times, and continue to record and perform around the world to this day, although in reality this is just Arturo and some of his friends. Their legacy, however, is primarily based on their late 1970s output. \\"Shadow\\", \\"Ain't Got a Clue\\", and \\"Just Thirteen\\" in particular are cited by punk cognoscenti as classic examples of the style, and still show up from time to time on genre overview compilations. The current line-up is: Bassick (bass and vocals) who also plays for 999, Dave Kemp (guitar) and Stuart Meadows (drums). In January 2009 the band supported punk legends the Buzzcocks on fourteen dates of their UK tour. In the 2010s, Esso, Stride and Moore collaborated again, initially under the name of The Lurkers:God's Lonely Men before later reverting to just The Lurkers. They released a CD in 2012 entitled Chemical Landslide which contained tracks considered a lot heavier than anything they had previously recorded under the Lurkers name. In 2016 they released a further album The Future's Calling and collaborated on follow-up material with The Featherz' lead singer Danie Cox. The fruit of the collaboration with Cox - the single A Side High Velocity - was released on 24 November 2017 as a limited edition of 500 copies on 7 inch pink vinyl. and the band recorded further material with Cox in December 2017. By February 2018 Cox, now known as Danie Centric, was enlisted as long term vocalist for Esso, Stride and Moore's version of the band (while also continuing with The Featherz, with whom, during their set at the 2018 Rebellion Festival, she previewed live a new Lurkers song, \\"This Is Your Revolution.\\") The band's second single with Centric - \\"Electrical Guitar\\"/\\"That Was Julia\\" was released in January 2019 and topped the UK Vinyl Singles chart.

Headquartered in the provincial capital of Regina, the channel is owned by the Rogers Media subsidiary of Rogers Communications and operates as a de facto owned-and-operated station of its Citytv television network. Its studios are shared with CBC's Regina studios on 2440 Broad Street in Downtown Regina. Citytv Saskatchewan is licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) as an educational programming service for the province of Saskatchewan. It was formerly operated by the government of Saskatchewan as a public broadcaster. In March 2010, the government announced that it would shut down the network due to low viewership. In June 2010, the government announced that it would instead privatize and sell the network to Bluestone Investment Group. Under Bluestone, SCN was converted to a format similar to Alberta's Access network, airing commercial-supported entertainment programming during the late-afternoon and prime time hours, and commercial- free educational and cultural programming from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. In late-December 2011, SCN announced that it would affiliate with Rogers' Citytv network for its entertainment programming beginning on January 2, 2012. In June 2012, Rogers would acquire SCN entirely, maintaining the same programming model implemented by Bluepoint. Because it is licensed as an educational broadcaster, Citytv Saskatchewan is required to be distributed as part of the basic cable service in Saskatchewan, and is also available on Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct. The channel is defined as a satellite-to-cable television programming undertaking, meaning that it has full simultaneous substitution rights for its programming in Saskatchewan, but does not operate any over-the- air transmitters. ==History== ===Public television=== In February 1991,Decision CRTC 91-98 CRTC, 1997-02-14 the Government of Saskatchewan (led at the time by Premier Grant Devine) was granted a broadcast licence for a non-commercial educational service by the CRTC. The channel, Saskatchewan Communications Network (SCN), was launched on May 6 of that year. (Ontario's TVOntario was launched on September 27, 1970; British Columbia's Knowledge was launched on January 12, 1981; and Alberta's Access, which is now the privately owned CTV 2 Alberta, was launched on June 30, 1973.) As a publicly owned entity, SCN received funding from the Government of Saskatchewan and from the general public in the form of donations. At the time, SCN frequently stopped between shows to ask for pledges like other public broadcasters such as PBS in the United States. ===Privatization=== On March 24, 2010, the Government of Saskatchewan (now led by Premier Brad Wall) announced that it would wind down SCN's operations, citing low ratings, with some operations such as distance education broadcasts to be transferred to SaskTel.Government Provides SCN Core Services in More Efficient Manner , Government of Saskatchewan press release, 2010-03-24 The channel was to have shut down at the end of April, but it was later decided to keep the channel in operation while offers to buy SCN were evaluated.Neil Scott, SCN to remain operating while expressions of interest evaluated, Leader-Post, 2010-05-01, accessed 2010-05-01 On June 21, 2010, the Government of Saskatchewan announced the channel would be sold to Bluepoint Investment Corporation. During the CRTC approval process, Bluepoint requested several amendments to SCN's licence, which would allow the channel to air limited amounts of non-educational programming with commercials.Sask. TV network sold to Ontario firm, CBC News, 2010-06-21, accessed 2010-06-21 The CRTC approved the sale of SCN to Bluepoint and the licence amendments on December 23, 2010.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-965 The transaction was completed shortly thereafter, and at that point, SCN lost its original funding streams of government funding and public donations. Under Bluepoint's approved amendments to its licence, SCN was still required to air commercial-free educational programming from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m.; after 3 p.m., the channel would be allowed to air entertainment-based programming with up to 14 minutes of advertising per hour – Bluepoint planned to use this new ability to air programming that could attract new advertising revenue to the channel, in a hybrid format similar to Alberta's Access. When Bluepoint took over control of the station, few changes were made to SCN's programming, other than introducing films seven nights a week starting at 9 p.m. during the summer of 2011.SCN Summer Schedule SCN press release 2011-05-03 The first major changes to the channel occurred on September 12, 2011, premiering a new prime time lineup of current American network series such as Supernatural and The Insider, and classic series such as Danger Bay, Family Ties, and Frasier.Claassen’s Bluepoint to introduce revamped SCN in September Marketing 2011-08-15 ===Affiliation with Citytv, acquisition by Rogers=== On December 20, 2011, SCN announced that it had entered into an affiliation agreement with Rogers Communications to air Citytv programs from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. starting on January 2, 2012, with educational, children's and locally produced programming continuing to air on SCN outside those hours (to fulfill the channel's licence as an educational station). The post-3 p.m. programming, branded as \\"Citytv on SCN\\", consisted of entertainment programming sourced from Rogers' Citytv stations, including the network's prime time lineup.Citytv and SCN Sign Affiliate Agreement CNW press release 2011-12-20 With the Citytv affiliation, SCN became the second Canadian educational television service to carry entertainment programming from one of the major commercial networks or television systems. The other was Alberta's Access, which adopted the CTV Two name and lineup upon its relaunch in August 2011. It also gave the Citytv system affiliations in all provinces west of Quebec and south of the federal territories of Northern Canada. (Rogers later expanded Citytv into Quebec when it affiliated with CJNT Montreal in June 2012, which the company also purchased.)Citytv expanding into Quebec & Western Canada , CityNews, May 3, 2012. The next year, Rogers Media announced its intent to acquire SCN from Bluepoint Investment Corporation. The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 21, 2012 and closed later that month, making the channel an owned-and-operated station of the Citytv system. Rogers relaunched the channel as Citytv Saskatchewan on July 1.Rogers Media Receives CRTC Approval to Launch Citytv Saskatchewan CNW press release 2012-06-21 Rogers planned to invest into improving the channel's infrastructure, and to launch a high definition feed for the channel in the coming year. No regional news programming is planned for the channel under Rogers ownership; as such, Citytv Saskatchewan is the first Citytv owned-and-operated station to carry no localized news programming (All other Citytv stations air nightly CityNews broadcasts at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., as well as a national broadcast of Breakfast Television. Citytv stations in Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver also air their own local versions of BT.) ==Programming== In addition to airing Citytv's schedule of entertainment programming, Rogers committed when the channel was purchased to maintaining the channel's requirement to air commercial-free educational programming from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. Children's programming airs from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. in a block branded as CityKids, with educational programming for adults and older youth aired from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. daily. ==See also== * CTV 2 Alberta - a similar cable-only affiliate of CTV 2 in the Canadian province of Alberta; formerly Access * CTV 2 Atlantic - a similar cable-only affiliate of CTV 2 in Atlantic Canada; formerly the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) and A Atlantic * The CW Plus - an alternate feed of The CW for small and mid-size television markets in the United States, consisting of privately owned digital multicast channels and cable-only affiliates, with syndicated programs supplied by the network in addition to CW network programming ==References== ==External links== * Category:Educational television networks in Canada Category:Public television in Canada Category:Citytv stations Category:Companies based in Regina, Saskatchewan Category:Television stations in Saskatchewan Category:Television channels and stations established in 1991 Category:Analog cable television networks in Canada Category:Former Crown corporations of Canada Category:Crown corporations of Saskatchewan Category:1991 establishments in Saskatchewan ","title":"Citytv Saskatchewan"},{"id":"1423056","text":"Radiation reduced hybrid is procedure in discovering the location of genetic markers relative to one another. The relative location of these markers can be combined into a physical map or a genetic map. The radiation hybrid technique begins as another way to amplify and purify DNA, the first step in any sequencing project; radiation is used to break the DNA into pieces and these pieces are incorporated into the hybrid cell; the hybrid can be grown in large quantities. One can then check for the presence of various genetic markers using PCR and linkage analysis to resolve the distance between the markers. That is, if two genetic markers are near each other, they are less likely to be separated by the DNA-breaking radiation. The technique is similar to traditional linkage analysis, where we depend on genetic recombination to calculate the distance between two genetic markers. == Procedure == The procedure utilizes two cell lines, neither of which can survive in toxic media, but contain genes that can resist the toxin when contained by the same cell. The cell line under study is irradiated, causing breaks in the DNA. These cells are fused with the other cell line, producing a hybrid. If the hybrid incorporates genes from both cells, it will be able to survive in the toxic media. The cells that survive can be grown in large quantities, thus amplifying the DNA that was incorporated from the irradiated cell line. One can prepare a sample of DNA from the hybrid cell line and use PCR to amplify two specific genetic markers. By running the PCR products on a gel, one can determine if both markers are in the cell line. If both markers are usually in the hybrid, we can conclude that they are near each other. == References == * Category:Genetics ","title":"Radiation reduced hybrid"},{"id":"1423069","text":"PDL is an initialism for: == Politics == *Democratic Liberal Party (Partidul Democrat Liberal), a former political party in Romania *Labour Democratic Party (Partito Democratico del Lavoro), a former political party in Italy *Pole of Freedoms (Polo delle Libertà), a former political alliance in Italy *The People of Freedom (Il Popolo della Libertà), a former political party in Italy * Free Destourian Party (Parti Destourien Libre), a current political in Tunisia == Science, mathematics and technology== ===Computing=== *Page description language *Perl Data Language and the data type it supports *Program Design Language, a method of software construction *Progressive download *Public Documentation License, used with OpenOffice.org *Personal Distribution List *People Data List *Permissioned distributed ledger ===Other uses in science and technology=== *Periodontal ligament *Power door locks *Propositional dynamic logic *Pulsed dye laser *Poundal, a unit of force (abbreviated pdl) *Polarization Dependent Loss, see Polarization mode dispersion == Sport == *Premier Development League, the former name of a developmental soccer league in the United States and Canada now known as USL League Two. *Professional Development League, an English system of youth football leagues. == Other uses == *Purpose Driven Life, the best-selling bible study book written by Christian pastor Rick Warren and published by Zondervan in 2002. *Payday loan *PDL BioPharma, formerly Protein Design Labs *Punch-Drunk Love, a 2002 film *João Paulo II Airport (IATA code PDL) *Previously-Developed Land, see Brownfield land *Ponta Delgada Airport *Poorly Drawn Lines, an absurdist webcomic ","title":"PDL"},{"id":"1423072","text":"Alexey, Alexei, Alexie, or Aleksey ( ; ) is a Russian and Bulgarian male first name deriving from the Greek Aléxios (), meaning \\"Defender\\", and thus of the same origin as the Latin Alexius.

Born into a Jewish family, he was raised as a non-Jew but was not baptized. “Many persons have become Jews since Hitler,\\" he said. \\"I have been a Jew since the murder of Walther Rathenau [in 1922], from which date I have emphasized that I am a Jew.””Emil Ludwig, Famous Biographer, Calls on Jews to Answer Hitler ‘in Own Terms’”, The Sentinel (Chicago), 13 August 1936, p. 36.Harry Hansen, “Ludwig, Emil,” Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. 7, New York: Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc., 1942, p. 231. Ludwig studied law but chose writing as a career. At first he wrote plays and novellas, also working as a journalist. In 1906, he moved to Switzerland, but, during World War I, he worked as a foreign correspondent for the Berliner Tageblatt in Vienna and Istanbul. He became a Swiss citizen in 1932, later emigrating to the United States in 1940. At the end of the Second World War, he went to Germany as a journalist, and it is to him that we owe the retrieving of Goethe's and Schiller's coffins, which had disappeared from Weimar in 1943/44. He returned to Switzerland after the war and died in 1948, in Moscia, near Ascona. In 1944, Ludwig wrote a letter to The New York Times where he urged that \\"Hitler’s fanaticism against the Jews could be exploited by the Allies. The Three Powers should send a proclamation to the German people through leaflets and to the German Government through neutral countries; threatening that further murdering of Jews would involve terrible retaliation after victory. This would drive a wedge into the already existing dissension of the generals and the Nazis, and also between ultra- Nazis and other Germans.”Emil Ludwig Says Hitler’s Anti-semitism Can Be Exploited by Allies to Split Germans JTA.com During the 1920s, he achieved international fame for his popular biographies which combined historical fact and fiction with psychological analysis. After his biography of Goethe was published in 1920, he wrote several similar biographies, including one about Bismarck (1922-24) and another about Jesus (1928). As Ludwig's biographies were popular outside of Germany and were widely translated, he was one of the fortunate émigrés who had an income while living in the United States. His writings were considered particularly dangerous by Goebbels, who mentioned him in his journal. Ludwig interviewed Benito Mussolini and on 1 December 1929 Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. His interview with the founder of the Republic of Turkey appeared in Wiener Freie Presse in March 1930, addressing issues of religion and music. He also interviewed Joseph Stalin in Moscow on 13 December 1931. An excerpt from this interview is included in Stalin's book on Lenin. Ludwig describes this interview in his biography of Stalin. Ludwig's extended interviews with T.G. Masaryk, founder and longtime president of Czechoslovakia, appeared as Defender of Democracy in 1936. == French and English editions of works by Ludwig == The following French editions of Emil Ludwig's books were published in the period 1926-1940: Biographies: Goethe (3 volumes), Napoléon, Bismarck, Trois Titans, Lincoln, Le Fils de l'Homme, Le Nil (2 volumes). Political works: Guillaume II, Juillet 1914, Versailles, Hindenburg, Roosevelt, Barbares et Musiciens, La Conquête morale de l'Allemagne, Entretiens avec Mussolini, La Nouvelle Sainte-Alliance. Biographies of Goethe, Napoleon, Bismarck and Wilhelm Hohenzollern are available in English from G. P. Putnam's Sons (New York and London). Emil Ludwig was – and remains – renowned for a popular biography of Napoleon published in English in 1926, just after it was published in Germany in the original German, while Ludwig was still living there. This book is still quite readable today – Ludwig has a rare gift of evoking a vanished era in straightforward plain prose. The book has a rare quality of immediacy, as if what Ludwig writes of were almost current history.

Nos. 1 and 2 were composed for orchestra, and later arranged for piano, piano duet and two pianos, whereas nos. 3 and 4 were written for piano only. Of the four, the first is the most popular and has been frequently performed in concert and recorded.Hamilton, 80. Associated with the Mephisto Waltzes is the Mephisto Polka, which follows the same program as the other Mephisto works. ==The Waltzes== === No. 1, S.514 === Excerpt from the beginning of the Mephisto Waltz No. 1 Mephisto Waltz No. 1 is the best-known of the series and, together with No. 3, the most praised musically. Mephisto Waltz No. 1, Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke (The Dance in the Village Inn) is the second of two short works he wrote for orchestra. While the work preceding it, \\"Midnight Procession\\" (\\"Der nächtliche Zug\\"), is rarely given (though both works have been recorded together), the waltz has been a concert favorite, with its passion, sensuality and dramatics generating an emotional impact. James Huneker described the work's \\"langourous syncopated melody\\" as \\"one of the most voluptuous episodes outside of the Tristan score\\". The Mephisto Waltz No. 1 is a typical example of program music, taking for its program an episode from Nikolaus Lenau's 1836 verse drama (not from Goethe's Faust). The following program note, which Liszt took from Lenau, appears in the printed score: > There is a wedding feast in progress in the village inn, with music, > dancing, carousing. Mephistopheles and Faust pass by, and Mephistopheles > induces Faust to enter and take part in the festivities. Mephistopheles > snatches the fiddle from the hands of a lethargic fiddler and draws from it > indescribably seductive and intoxicating strains. The amorous Faust whirls > about with a full-blooded village beauty in a wild dance; they waltz in mad > abandon out of the room, into the open, away into the woods. The sounds of > the fiddle grow softer and softer, and the nightingale warbles his love- > laden song.Quoted in Liszt intended to publish the Waltz simultaneously with the Night Procession: \\"...The publication of the two Lenau's Faust episodes... I entrust to Schuberth's own judgement; as to whether the piano version or the score appears first, makes no difference to me; the only important thing is that both pieces should appear simultaneously, the Night Procession as No.1 and the Mephisto Waltz as No.2. There is naturally no thematic relationship between the two pieces; but they are related nonetheless by all the contrasts of emotions. A Mephisto of this kind may only arise from such a poodle!...\\"From a letter of Liszt to Fr. Brendel, Rome, 29 August 1862. Liszt’s request was not fulfilled and the two episodes were published separately. The waltz was conceived as both an orchestra and a piano work. Three versions, orchestral (S.110/2), piano duet (S.599/2) and piano solo, (S.514), all date more or less from the same period (1859–62). The piano duet version is a straightforward transcription of the orchestral version, while the solo piano version is an independent composition. Liszt dedicated the piece to Karl Tausig, his favourite pupil.Howard, Waltzes, 3. A further two piano version, published by Schuberth in 1885, was arranged by Dr. Fritz Stade and later revised by Isidor Philipp. The orchestral version also has an alternate, softer ending which, while not as rousing as the usual coda, some critics argue is closer to the intent of Lenau's tale. While this ending is not often heard in the concert hall, both Fritz Reiner and James Conlon have recorded it. He also provided two extra passages for the piano solo version. It is not known when Liszt wrote these extra passages, but it was a habit of his later years to make alterations while teaching his works to his pupils. === No. 2, S.515 === The Second Mephisto Waltz followed the first by some 20 years. Its composition took place between late 1880 and early 1881. Liszt wrote the orchestral version (S.111) first, then based both the piano solo (S.515) and four-hand (S.600) versions on it. The orchestral version was premiered in Budapest in 1881. After this performance Liszt extended the work and changed the ending radically. The printed music for all three versions is based on this revision and is dedicated to Camille Saint-Saëns.Franz Liszt's music manuscripts in the national Széchényi Library, Budapest. By Mária P. Eckhardt, Országos Széchényi Könyvtár Harmonically, the second waltz anticipates Scriabin, Busoni and Bartók. Liszt begins and ends the work with an unresolved tritone, a musical interval famous as representing the devil in music, and the music overall is more violently expressive than both its predecessor and Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse macabre, which Liszt had transcribed a few years earlier.Searle, \\"Final,\\" 70. The piece, for all its dissonance, remains firmly in E major until the B–F tritone shatters the work's climax at the piece's end. This gesture leaves the work's ending unresolved harmonically.Searle, New Grove, 14:783. === No. 3, S.215a and S.216 === Composed in 1883, the Third Mephisto Waltz (S.216) takes the harmonic language even further, featuring chords built up by fourths with numerous passages of descending minor triads whose roots are a semitone apart. The chord on which these progressions are based, according to Alan Walker, \\"is difficult to explain in terms of traditional harmony. It is best regarded as a 'fourths' chord in its last inversion.\\"Walker, The Final Years, 450–451. Tonally, the music is pulled between F major, D minor and D minor. As in its predecessors, the Third Waltz has the devil dancing in triple time while other groups of three move past so quickly that a larger rhythm of four is established, and triple time is abandoned altogether in the dreamlike passage near the work's conclusion. Humphrey Searle, in his book The Music of Liszt, considers this piece to be one of Liszt's finest achievements.Searle, Music, 114–115. This waltz bore no dedication initially. After French pianist Marie Jaëll played the work for the composer (who asked her to repeat certain passages over and over again), he made extensive changes to the work and dedicated it to her. Saint-Saëns, Jaëll's composition teacher at the Paris Conservatoire (who also dedicated his first piano concerto to her), commented about her interpretation of Liszt's works that \\"only one person in the world [besides Liszt] who can play Liszt—Marie Jaëll\\".A Study of Franz Liszt's Concepts of Changing Tonality as Exemplified in Selected \\"Mephisto\\" Works. By Jung-Ah Kim Liszt made no orchestral version of the piece. However, British composer and arranger Gordon Jacob orchestrated this along with other late works of Liszt for the Sadlers Wells ballet Apparitions, a project conceived by composer Constant Lambert. The first recording of this piece was by France Clidat in her traversal of Liszt's works for Decca.Liner notes to the France Clidat recordings. === No. 4, S.216b === The Fourth Mephisto Waltz (S.696) remained unfinished and was not published until 1955. Liszt worked on the piece in 1885. Like the second waltz, the fourth uses an introduction and coda which do not stick to the basic key. While the work is mainly in D, it begins and ends on a C. This, writes noted Australian Liszt scholar and pianist Leslie Howard,Howard recorded all of Liszt's solo piano pieces (over 95 CDs) and has written extensively on Liszt's work. was an encouragement while working on his performing version to refer to the main material in the slow Andantino and to recapitulate a portion of the fast Allegro before Liszt's coda.Howard, Waltzes, 4. Some critics do not consider this waltz as original as its predecessors and surmise that, had Liszt lived to complete it, he might have made considerable improvements.Searle, \\"Final,\\" 71. No orchestral version of this waltz was made by Liszt. Despite its being unfinished, this waltz is still considered playable. It is usually performed in a version (S.216b) combining the completed fast outer sections, omitting the incomplete slow middle section. Howard made a performing version of this waltz in 1978 which utilizes a middle section assembled from Liszt's manuscript sources, completed in line with the composer's late style and with a minimum number of added notes from Howard. A recording of this completion is available on Hyperion's \\"Complete Piano Music of Liszt\\" series, while the sheet music, dedicated to Alfred Brendel, has been published by Basil Ramsey,Howard, 1. and once again in 1988 by Orpheus Publications. However, the first recording of a version of this piece was by France Clidat in her traversal of Liszt's works for Decca. ==Bagatelle sans tonalité== The Bagatelle sans tonalité (Bagatelle without tonality; German: Bagatelle ohne Tonart), S. 216a, is sometimes included with Liszt's Mephisto Waltzes. The manuscript bears the title \\"Fourth Mephisto Waltz\\"Howard, Waltzes, 1, 3. and may have been intended to replace the Fourth Mephisto Waltz when it appeared Liszt might not be able to finish it.Baker, 116. Critics point out the similarity in tonal center between these two pieces (D major) as confirmation of their composition shortly after one other in 1885 as well as Liszt's initial intent with the \\"Bagatelle\\".Baker, 118–119. ==Legacy== The pieces are referenced as the title of the 1969 novel, The Mephisto Waltz by American author and Juilliard-trained pianist Fred Mustard Stewart. Composer Jerry Goldsmith incorporated the pieces into his score for the 1971 film of the same name based on Stewart's novel. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ed.

It is a multi-purpose rock and earth-fill embankment dam on the Bhagirathi River near Tehri in Uttarakhand, India. It is the primary dam of the THDC India Ltd. and the Tehri hydroelectric complex. Phase 1 was completed in 2006. The Tehri Dam withholds a reservoir for irrigation, municipal water supply and the generation of of hydroelectricity. The dam's 1,000 MW variable-speed pumped-storage scheme is currently under construction with expected commissioning in May 2018. ==History== Tehri dam in November 2004 A preliminary investigation for the Tehri Dam Project was completed in 1961 and its design was completed in 1972 with a 600 MW capacity power plant based on the study. Construction began in 1978 after feasibility studies but was delayed due to financial, environmental and social impacts. In 1986, technical and financial assistance was provided by the USSR, but this was interrupted years later with political instability. India was forced to take control of the project and at the first, it was placed under the direction of the Irrigation Department of Uttar Pradesh. However, in 1988 the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation was formed to manage the dam and 75% of the funding would be provided by the federal government, 25% by the state. Uttar Pradesh would finance the entire irrigation portion of the project. ==Technical description== The main power house of Tehri Dam that houses four generators each capable of producing 250 MW of power. Tehri Dam is a ' high rock and earth-fill embankment dam. Its length is , crest width , and base width . The dam creates a reservoir of with a surface area of . The installed hydrocapacity is 1,000 MW along with an additional 1,000 MW of pumped storage hydroelectricity. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage plant is created by the Koteshwar Dam downstream. The Tehri Dam and the Tehri Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Power Plant are part of the Tehri Hydropower Complex which also includes the 400 MW Koteshwar Dam.Tehri Dam: An Engineering Marvel, by Basistha Raj Adhikari Tehri pumped storage plant (4 X 250 MW) has variable speed features which can optimize the round trip efficiency under varying water levels in its reservoirs. Power is distributed to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh . The complex will afford irrigation to an area of , irrigation stabilization to an area of , and a supply of of drinking water per day to the industrialized areas of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The total expenditure for this project was USD 1 billion. ===Scheduling and generation dispatch=== The scheduling and dispatch of the Tehri Hydro Power plant is done by Northern Regional Load Dispatch Center which is the apex body to ensure the integrated operation of the power system grid in the Northern region and comes under Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO). At present, THDC India Ltd. is generating around 3,000 GWh annually from this dam. ==Environmental issues== Tehri dam in July 2008 The Tehri Dam has been the object of protests by environmental organizations and local people of the region. Virendra Dutt Saklani, lawyer and founder of the Anti-Tehri Dam Struggle Committee, was quick to point out the consequences associated to the large project. Environmental activist Sunderlal Bahuguna led the Anti-Tehri Dam movement from 1980s till 2004. The protest was against the displacement of town inhabitants and environmental consequence of the weak ecosystem. In addition to the human rights concerns, the project has spurred concerns about the environmental consequences of locating such a large dam in the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayan foothills. There are further concerns regarding the dam's geological stability. The Tehri dam is in the Central Himalayan Seismic Gap, a major geologic fault zone. This region was the site of a 6.8 magnitude earthquake in October 1991, with an epicenter from the dam. Dam proponents claim that the complex is designed to withstand an earthquake of 8.4 magnitude, but some seismologists say that earthquakes with a magnitude of 8.5 or more could occur in this region. Were such a catastrophe to occur, the potentially resulting dam-break would submerge numerous towns downstream, whose populations total near half a million. A protest message against Tehri dam, which was steered by Sundarlal Bahuguna for years. It says \\"We don't want the dam. The dam is the mountain's destruction.\\" The relocation of more than 100,000 people from the area has led to protracted legal battles over resettlement rights and, ultimately, resulted in the project's delayed completion.Terminski, Bogumil (2013). \\"Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges\\", Indiana University, available at http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/8833?show=full Since 2005, filling of the reservoir has led to the reduced flow of Bhagirathi water from the normal to a mere . This reduction has been central to local protest against the dam, since the Bhagirathi is considered part of the sacred Ganges whose waters are crucial to Hindu beliefs. At some points during the year, the tampering with Bhagirathi waters means this tributary stops flowing. This has created resentments among many Hindus, who claim that the sanctity of the Ganges has been compromised for the generation of electricity. The officials say that when the reservoir is filled to its maximum capacity the flow of the river will again become normal.

The purchase was tied to Bell Media's pending takeover of Astral Media; an earlier proposal had been rejected by the CRTC in October 2012 due to concerns surrounding its total market share following the merger, but was restructured under the condition that the companies divest certain media properties. In a separate deal, Corus also acquired Shaw's interests in Séries+ and Historia, giving it full ownership. The deals were approved by the CRTC on 20 December 2013 and Corus officially become the full owner of the channel on 1 January 2014. On October 17, 2017, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire Séries+ and Historia from Corus for $200 million, pending regulatory approval. Corus cited the two channels as not being part of the company's \\"strategic priorities\\" at this time; the deal came shortly after an announcement that Corus no longer planned to commission original programs for the two channels. On 28 May 2018, both transactions were blocked by the Competition Bureau, as it violated a condition of the Astral Media purchase which bars Bell from re-acquiring any of the properties it divested for 10 years. As a result, Bell and Corus mutually agreed to shelve the sale.

It is named for its resemblance to the roots of the banyan tree which cross over in complex patterns. Logical banyan switches are used in logic or signal pathways to crossover switching of signals onto new pathways. They can be mechanical microelectromechanical systems, electrical or optical NLO. Their complexity depends on the topology of the individual switches in a switch matrix (how wide it is by how many 'plies' or layers of switches it takes), to implement a desired crossover logic. ==Design== Typical crossover matrices follow this formula: an N×N banyan switch uses (N/2) log2 N elements. Other formulas are used for differing number of crossover layers, and scaling is possible, but becomes very large and complex with large N×N arrays. CAD can be used to take the drudgery out of creating these designs. A banyan network is implemented by interconnecting 2×2 switching networks in multiple and recursive stages. The switches are measured by how many stages, and how many up/down sorters and crosspoints they have. Switches often have buffers built-in for faster switching. A typical switch may have: # A 2×2 and 4×4 down sorter # Followed by an 8×8 up sorter # Followed by a 2×2 crosspoint banyan switch network This results in 3 level sorting for a 3-stage banyan network switch. ==A simple example== left Consider a 2×2 banyan switch, which requires (2/2) log2 2 = 1 switching element. This switch takes two inputs, numbered 0 and 1, and two outputs, numbered 0 and 1. Every packet that comes in has a header that contains one bit indicating what its destination is (either 0 or 1). If the switch reads the bit and it has value 0, it sends the packet to its higher output (which is 0 in this case), and to its lower output if the routing bit is one. By connecting these switching elements in series and parallel it is possible therefore, to route packets in more complicated ways depending on the desired routes to establish. ==Future directions and further information== The future is moving to larger arrays of inputs and outputs needed in a very small space. See wafer fabrication and VLAs. ==See also== *Crossover switches *Crossbar switches *Clos network a non blocking crossover switch that needs fewer than N² switches *Nonblocking minimal spanning switch and signal switching. *Optical computer ==References== * Category:Switches ","title":"Banyan switch"},{"id":"1423144","text":"Bojan Djordjic ( or Bojan Đorđić, born 6 February 1982) is a Swedish former footballer who played as a midfielder. ==Club career== === Early career and Manchester United === Born in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia, to Serbian professional footballer Ranko Đorđić, Djordjic started his career at IF Brommapojkarna before moving to Manchester United in 1999 as a youth player. Although considered a budding talent, having been awarded the club's Jimmy Murphy Player of the Year Award at the age of 18, he only made two competitive appearances for the club. He also scored with a chip in a 2–0 win against Celtic in Tom Boyd's testimonial at Celtic Park on 15 May 2001, after coming on as a substitute for Ryan Giggs. He was loaned to Sheffield Wednesday, Aarhus GF and Red Star Belgrade, where he scored his first senior goal against Odense BK in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup. === Rangers === He signed for Rangers in Scotland in January 2005 on a free transfer. On 9 January 2005 he made his full debut against Celtic in the Scottish Cup. However, injuries limited his chances to establish himself in the first team at Ibrox Stadium. === Plymouth Argyle === Djordjic moved to Plymouth Argyle on at the end of the 2004–05 season having made four league appearances during Rangers title winning campaign. Other club interested in the winger was Stockholm-based side AIK, the club that Djordjic supports. On 24 August 2006, after spending just over a season at Plymouth, Djordjic was placed on the transfer list by manager Ian Holloway as a result of his sometimes lax attitude towards the team when playing and training. He was promised the opportunity to get back into the first team once his attitude improved. Djordjic finally returned to the starting lineup after he scored eight goals in five games for the reserves and after exactly a three-month absence, on 18 November 2006, scoring in the fifth minute in a 1–1 away draw at Southend United. He was removed from the transfer list the following week, and went on to score in the next two consecutive games (Leeds United and Luton Town). === AIK === On 19 October 2007, Djordjic's contract was terminated by mutual consent due to lack of first-team opportunities. On 13 November, it was officially announced he had signed a two-year deal with Swedish club AIK. His first season for the club has not been what he was hoping for with several injuries and on 13 September 2008 he was injured once again and missed the remaining eight matches of the season.Bojan Djordjic opererad His first match for AIK was against Kalmar FF on 30 March 2008 in the first game of the 2008 season.AIK närmast segern i underhållande match During the 2009 transfer season, Djordjic was approached by Maccabi Haifa which offering him a contract, however Djordjic rejected saying that he wanted to stay with the club in his heart AIK.

Due to the start of the season of 2010, AIK was underperforming as defending champions. This led that club was struggling to avoid relegation. The coach Mikael Stahre left for Panionios GSS and much criticism was aimed at the team's bad performances. === Videoton === On 28 June media reported that the Hungarian club Videoton had bought both Djordjic and Martin Mutumba. The director of the Hungarian club compared Djordjic with Roberto Baggio and Mutumba was compared with Ronaldinho. The transfer led to many speculations in media, especially since AIK had appointed the Scottish manager Alex Miller only a couple of days before the transfer were made. The players claimed that it was Mr. Millers decision to let the players go, but the organization of AIK claimed that they got such a good offer that they could not refuse to sell. One year later, he terminated his contract that would have expired 2013. === Blackpool === Djordjic joined Blackpool on a two- year contract in June 2011, reuniting him with manager Holloway. \\"Ollie (Ian Holloway) is one of the few managers to get the best out of me and I always thought about that,\\" he said. \\"It's a big step when you're 29 to come back to English football to a club that's just been relegated from the Premier League.\\" His salary is believed to be a minimum of around £160,000 annually, with before bonuses.http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/internationell/england/article14030045.ab He cancelled his contract with Blackpool by mutual consent on 9 January 2012. === Royal Antwerp === On 4 February 2012, he signed a short-term contract with the Belgian Second Division club Royal Antwerp. === Return to Sweden === In June 2012, Djordjic returned to his boyhood club Brommapojkarna. in January 2014, he signed with the Division 1 Norra club Vasalunds IF. === Indian Super League === On 21 August 2014, Djordjic was a picked in the inaugural ISL International Draft, signing for Chennaiyin.

At one time, the montane shrew and the Orizaba long-tailed shrew were considered to belong to the same species. ==Range and habitat== This animal inhabits open and wooded areas in western Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide. In Canada, it is found in southern British Columbia, including Vancouver Island, and as far east as extreme south-western Alberta. In the United States, it is found throughout most of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as far south as central California, in northern and central Nevada, northern Utah, and western Montana and Wyoming. Their preferred habitat appears to be wet grassland and meadows, ranging from alpine tundra to swampland, and they are often found close to rivers or other sources of water. They are also found in open coniferous forest, but only rarely in dense woodlands. Because they often use fallen logs as cover, they prefer areas with moderate amounts of woody debris, and they may also prefer areas with more acidic soils than other local shrew species. One subspecies is found only in salt marshes. There are three recognised subspecies: * Sorex vagrans halicoetes - salt marshes in central California * Sorex vagrans paludivagus - central Californian coast * Sorex vagrans vagrans - throughout the remainder of the range Pleistocene fossils attributed to the species have been reported from Arkansas, New Mexico, and Texas. However, such fossils can be difficult to distinguish at the species level, and may represent close relatives such as montane or Pacific shrews. ==Description== Vagrant shrews are generally red brown in color with white or grey underparts, although coastal populations can be much darker, being almost black on the upper parts of the body. They have a long tail which is sometimes paler in color underneath, especially in juveniles. Although similar in appearance to other shrews found in the same area, it can be distinguished from the montane shrew by its smaller size and shorter tail, and by having a smaller number of friction pads on the hind feet. It can most readily be distinguished from Trowbridge's shrew by examining fine details of the shape of the skull, although the latter species also tends to have a more distinctly pale underside to the tail in adults. During winter, its fur is dark brown. The fall molt occurs between September and October, beginning firstly on the rump and progressing forwards, and then, separately, on the snout, and moving backwards. The timing of the spring molt is much more variable, even in the same population, so that individuals with summer and winter coats can be found together for several months during the spring, and even into the early summer. Its body is about in total length, including a long tail. The adult body weight ranges from , with males being slightly larger than females. The basal metabolic rate of vagrant shrews is 5.4 ml O2/g/h, with no evidence of torpor in winter. They are referred to sometimes as wandering shrews. ==Behavior== Vagrant shrews feed mainly on earthworms, spiders, insects, and other small invertebrates, but also eat some plant material. Because of their high metabolic rate, they have been reported to consume over 160% of their own body weight in food each day. Their primary predators include owls, and even bobcats. They are active throughout the day, typically for just five to ten minutes at a time before resting. They do, however, spend longer periods of time foraging at night than they do during the hours of daylight. They are generally solitary outside the spring breeding season, defending home ranges of around , by squeaking and making short charges at intruders, although actual fighting is rare. During the spring, home ranges are much larger, especially for the males. Throughout most of the year, vagrant shrews construct shallow cup-shaped nests, up to across, from vegetation and animal hair. In winter, they cover the nests with a domed roof to provide shelter. Females also construct similar domed nests during the breeding season, in which to rear their young. These are, however, larger than the winter nests, and may reach as much as across and up to in height. Vagrant shrews sometimes use echolocation to orient themselves in unfamiliar locations, although they are probably not able to use it to locate prey. It often uses runways created by voles. ==Reproduction== Vagrant shrews primarily breed between April and June, although births may occur as early as February, or as late as September. Gestation lasts twenty days, and results in the birth of a litter of two to eight young. A female may give birth to up to three litters each year. The young are born hairless and blind, weighing less than each. They grow rapidly throughout the first few weeks of life, beginning to develop fur by two weeks, opening their eyes by three weeks, and being weaned between sixteen and twenty five days after birth. The average life expectancy of a vagrant shrew has been estimated at a little over six months. However, they can live much longer; although few survive for more than seventeen months, a few survive their second winter and reach two years of age. ==References== Category:Sorex Category:Animals that use echolocation Category:Mammals described in 1857 Category:Taxa named by Spencer Fullerton Baird ","title":"Vagrant shrew"},{"id":"1423187","text":"In electronics, a crossover switch or matrix switch is a switch connecting multiple inputs to multiple outputs using complex array matrices designed to switch any one input path to any one (or more) output path(s). There are blocking and non-blocking types of cross-over switches. These switches can be microelectromechanical systems, electrical, or optical non-linear optics, and are used in electronics and fiber optic circuits, as well as some optical computers. A banyan switch is one type of cross-over switch. Their complexity depends on the topology of the individual switches in a switch matrix (how wide it is by how many 'plies' or layers of switches it takes), to implement the desired crossover logic. Typical crossover matrices follow the formula: an N×N Banyan switch uses (N/2) log N elements. Other formulas are used for differing number of cross-over layers, and scaling is possible, but becomes very large and complex with large N×N arrays. CAD and AI can be used to take the drudgery out of these designs. The switches are measured by how many stages, and how many up/down sorters and crosspoints. Switches often have buffers built in to speed up switching speeds. A typical switch may have a 2×2 and 4×4 down sorter, followed by an 8×8 up sorter, followed by a 2×2 crosspoint banyan switch network, resulting in a 3-level sorting for a 3-stage banyan network switch.

Julius Waldemar Grosse (25 April 1828 - 9 May 1902), German poet, the son of a military chaplain, was born at Erfurt. ==Biography== He received his early education at the gymnasium in Magdeburg, and on leaving school and showing disinclination for the ministry, entered an architect's office. But his mind was bent upon literature, and in 1849 he entered the university of Halle, where, although inscribed as a student of law, he devoted himself almost exclusively to letters. His first poetical essay was with the tragedy Cola di Rienzi (1851), followed in the same year by a comedy, Eine Nachtpartie Shakespeares, which was at once produced on the stage. The success of these first two pieces encouraged him to follow literature as a profession, and proceeding in 1852 to Munich, he joined the circle of young poets of whom Paul Heyse and Hermann Lingg (1820-1905) were the chief. For six years (1855-1861) he was dramatic critic of the Neue Münchener Zeitung, and was then for a while on the staff of the Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung, but in 1862 he returned to Munich as editor of the Bayrische Zeitung, a post he retained until the paper ceased to exist in 1867. In 1869 Grosse was appointed secretary of the Schiller-Stiftung, and lived for the next few years alternately in Weimar, Dresden and Munich, until, in 1890, he took up his permanent residence in Weimar. He was made Grand-ducal Hofrat and had the title of professor. He died at Torbole on the Lago di Garda on 9 May 1902. Grosse was a most prolific writer of novels, dramas and poems. As a lyric poet, especially in Gedichte (1857) and Aus bewegten Tagen, a volume of poems (1869), he showed himself more to advantage than in his novels, of which latter, however, Untreu aus Mitleid (2 vols, 1868); Vox populi, vox dei (1869); Maria Mancini (1871); Neue Erzahlungen (1875); Sophie Monnier (1876), and Ein Frauenlos (1888) are remarkable for a certain elegance of style. His tragedies, Die Ynglinger (1858); Tiberius (180); Johann von Schwaben; and the comedy Die steinerne Braut, had considerable success on the stage. Grosse's Gesammelte dramatische Werke appeared in 7 vols in Leipzig (1870), while his Erzahlende Dichtungen were published at Berlin (6 vols, 1871-1873).

He also succeeded to the hereditary office of Earl Marshal held by the Dukes of Norfolk. In 1895 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Postmaster General by Lord Salisbury, a post he held until early 1900, when he resigned in order to serve in the Boer War.http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/issue/21st-april-1900/38#articles In 1895 he also became Mayor of Sheffield; serving two terms during which he arranged the city's monumental celebrations in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Shortly thereafter he was appointed the first Lord Mayor of Sheffield, but retained the office only until November 1897. He was appointed an honorary Freeman of the City of Sheffield three years later.

In his dual role as Premier Duke and most prominent Roman Catholic in England, he undertook a programme of philanthropy which served in part to reintegrate Roman Catholics into civic life. He was born a generation after the Catholic Relief Act 1829 but before the reconstitution of Roman Catholic dioceses in 1850. By the time he came of age as Duke in 1868, the process of Catholic Emancipation had made the establishment of Catholic institutions legal, but the reality of two hundred years of legislation in favour of the Church of England left Roman Catholics with few structures of their own. Norfolk's first major benefaction commemorated his coming of age as Duke. At his ancestral seat of Arundel Castle (being also one of the Earls of Arundel), he sponsored the construction of the Church of Our Lady and St Philip Neri between 1868 and 1873. This church was later chosen to serve as Arundel Cathedral in 1965 and rededicated in 1971 to include Saint Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel, one of his ancestors. In 1877, he married his first wife, Lady Flora Hastings. He later wrote, 'Shortly after my most happy marriage, I wished to build a church as a thank-offering to God.' To commemorate this occasion, he undertook construction of a church in his titular ancestral seat in Norwich, Norfolk. After commencing in 1882 with a gift of £200,000, construction would not be completed until 1910, nearly 23 years after Lady Flora's death in 1887. This church was also later chosen to serve as St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich when the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia was re-established in 1976. In the 1890s Norfolk was instrumental in the campaign that convinced the Vatican authorities to relax its restrictions on Catholic students enrolling at the great English universities, culminating with the co-founding of St Edmund's College, Cambridge along with Baron Anatole von Hugel. He was a significant contributor to the Father Damien fund to fight leprosy. He also donated funds for the building of the University of Sheffield and was its initial Chancellor between 1905 and 1917.

He was National Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1996 until 1998, representing the regional Queensland-based seat of Capricornia. Marek was born at Mount Isa. He was a fitter and turner by trade, working at the Blair Athol coal mine at the time of his election, and operated his own smash repair business at Clermont. He was also a Shire of Belyando councillor, a local vice-president of the Australian Metal Workers' Union, and held a pilot's license. Marek was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 federal election, winning the marginal seat of Capricornia from Labor MP Marjorie Henzell in the major Liberal victory that year. During the campaign, he said that he \\"did not support the gay and lesbian movement\\" and \\"would prefer if they were back over the border where they were some 10, 15 years ago.\\" In November 1996, it emerged in parliament that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority had decided not to prosecute the newly-elected Marek for unauthorised and substandard plane maintenance, leading to opposition allegations of \\"special treatment\\". Marek became one of three outspoken right- wing Queensland Nationals MPs (along with De-Anne Kelly and Bob Katter) who broke with their own government's line on numerous occasions. In October 1997, the three MPs crossed the floor to support \\"about 40\\" amendments to the government's native title legislation after the Wik High Court case, with the intent of further restricting native title beyond the government's bill; however, Marek voted for the final bill after their amendments were voted down. In November, Marek stated that he wanted all Indigenous services to be abolished after the Wik legislation passed and said that land should have been bought from Indigenous people in earlier years, stating \\"all we would have to give them is 20 bucks and a box of Jatz\\". The Labor opposition attacked the remarks in parliament as \\"disgraceful\\" and \\"appalling and contemptible\\" and called for an apology, but senior colleagues Ron Boswell and John Herron refused to criticise him. During the 1998 federal election campaign, Marek spoke of the challenges of selling Coalition policy in his electorate amidst the rise of the new One Nation Party and broke with his party on two major policies. He stated that there was \\"no guarantee\\" that he would support his government's flagship goods and services tax proposal, noting that he believed \\"about 40 percent\\" of Australians opposed the GST altogether. He suggested that he would cross the floor to vote against it if his electorate opposed it, and requested that fruit and vegetables be granted an exemption from the tax. Marek was also resistant to the privatisation of Telstra, stating that he would not support the sale of any more than 49% of it. Along with Kelly and Katter, he broke with his national colleagues and directed preferences to One Nation above Labor at the election. The Sydney Morning Herald suggested during the campaign that Marek had \\"managed to neutralise much of the One Nation\\" insurrection\\" through his renegade policy stances and preference decisions. However, he was resoundingly defeated at the 1998 election by Labor candidate Kirsten Livermore. In 1999, he was the Townsville organiser of the \\"No\\" campaign in the 1999 Australian republic referendum. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Capricornia Category:People from Mount Isa Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Paul Marek"},{"id":"1423256","text":"Elimination of noise by using differential signaling. Differential signaling is a method for electrically transmitting information using two complementary signals. The technique sends the same electrical signal as a differential pair of signals, each in its own conductor. The pair of conductors can be wires (typically twisted together) or traces on a circuit board. The receiving circuit responds to the electrical difference between the two signals, rather than the difference between a single wire and ground. The opposite technique is called single-ended signalling. Differential pairs are usually found on printed circuit boards, in twisted-pair and ribbon cables, and in connectors. ==Advantages== Provided that the source and receiver impedances in a circuit are equal (it is balanced), external electromagnetic interference tends to affect both conductors identically. Since the receiving circuit only detects the difference between the wires, the technique resists electromagnetic noise compared to one conductor with an un-balanced reference (low-Ω connection to ground). Contrary to popular belief, differential signalling does not affect noise cancellation. Balanced lines with differential receivers will reject noise regardless of whether the signal is differential or single-ended, but since balanced line noise rejection requires a differential receiver anyway, differential signalling is often used on balanced lines. This improves SNR, reduces EMI, and makes the signal more immune to ground currents or differences. The technique works for both analog signaling, as in balanced audio—and digital signaling, as in RS-422, RS-485, Ethernet over twisted pair, PCI Express, DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB. In a system with a differential receiver, desired signals add and noise is subtracted away. === Suitability for use with low-voltage electronics === The electronics industry, particularly in portable and mobile devices, continually strives to lower supply voltage to save power. A low supply voltage, however, reduces noise immunity. Differential signaling helps to reduce these problems because, for a given supply voltage, it provides twice the noise immunity of a single-ended system. To see why, consider a single-ended digital system with supply voltage V_S. The high logic level is V_S\\\\, and the low logic level is 0 V. The difference between the two levels is therefore V_S - 0\\\\,\\\\mathrm{V} = V_S. Now consider a differential system with the same supply voltage. The voltage difference in the high state, where one wire is at V_S\\\\, and the other at 0 V, is V_S - 0\\\\,\\\\mathrm{V} = V_S. The voltage difference in the low state, where the voltages on the wires are exchanged, is 0\\\\,\\\\mathrm{V} - V_S = -V_S. The difference between high and low logic levels is therefore V_S - (-V_S) = 2V_S\\\\,. This is twice the difference of the single-ended system. If the voltage noise on one wire is uncorrelated to the noise on the other one, it takes twice as much noise to cause an error with the differential system as with the single-ended system. In other words, differential signalling doubles the noise immunity. === Resistance to electromagnetic interference === This advantage is not directly due to differential signaling itself, but to the common practice of transmitting differential signals on balanced lines. Single-ended signals are still resistant to interference if the lines are balanced and terminated by a differential amplifier. == Comparison with single-ended signaling == In single-ended signaling, the transmitter generates a single voltage that the receiver compares with a fixed reference voltage, both relative to a common ground connection shared by both ends. In many instances single-ended designs are not feasible. Another difficulty is the electromagnetic interference that can be generated by a single-ended signaling system that attempts to operate at high speed. == Generalization: Ensemble Signaling == The disadvantage of differential signal transmission is that it requires twice as many wires as single-ended signal transmission. Ensemble signaling improves this by using n wires to transmit n−1 differential signals. n = 2 is equivalent to differential signalling. === 2-wire ensemble signalling (encoding one signal using two wires) === Encoder: Using the generator matrix : \\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} +1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the input vector x := (x_1, x_2) you get y = \\\\mathbf{G} \\\\cdot x, the two signals to transmit. Decoder: Using the control matrix \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\mathbf{G}^{-1} : \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} +1/2 & -1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\;\\\\; 1/2 & \\\\;\\\\; 1/2 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the input vector y you get your initial vector x := \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\cdot y. ;But: Only x_1 is insensitive to common mode interferences, x_2 is highly sensitive to common mode interferences. By removing x_2 from the calculation you get normal differential signaling: : \\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} +1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\; and \\\\; \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} +1/2 & -1/2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} === 4-wire ensemble signalling (encoding three signals using four wires) === Encoder: Using the generator matrix : \\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1/3 & -1/3 & 1/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & 1 & -1/3 & 1/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & -1/3 & 1 & 1/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & -1/3 & -1/3 & 1/3 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the input vector x := (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) you get y = \\\\mathbf{G} \\\\cdot x, the four signals to transmit. Decoder: Using the control matrix \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\mathbf{G}^{-1} : \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3/4 & 0 & 0 & -3/4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 3/4 & 0 & -3/4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 3/4 & -3/4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3/4 & 3/4 & 3/4 & 3/4 \\\\end{pmatrix} and the input vector y you get your initial vector x := \\\\mathbf{H} \\\\cdot y. ;But: x_1, x_2 and x_3 is insensitive to common mode interferences, x_4 is highly sensitive to common mode interferences. By removing x_4 from the calculation you get the matrices for ensemble signaling using four wires to transmit three signals differentially. : \\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1/3 & -1/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & 1 & -1/3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & -1/3 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/3 & -1/3 & -1/3 \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\; and \\\\; \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} 3/4 & 0 & 0 & -3/4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 3/4 & 0 & -3/4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 3/4 & -3/4 \\\\end{pmatrix} === n-wire ensemble signalling (encoding n−1 signals using n wires) === \\\\mathbf{G} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\\\cdots & -1/(n-1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/(n-1) & \\\\cdots & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1/(n-1) & \\\\cdots & -1/(n-1) \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\; and \\\\; \\\\mathbf{H} := \\\\begin{pmatrix} (n-1)/n & \\\\cdots & 0 & -(n-1)/n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & -(n-1)/n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cdots & (n-1)/n & -(n-1)/n \\\\end{pmatrix} . == Uses == The technique minimizes electronic crosstalk and electromagnetic interference, both noise emission and noise acceptance, and can achieve a constant or known characteristic impedance, allowing impedance matching techniques important in a high-speed signal transmission line or high quality balanced line and balanced circuit audio signal path. Differential pairs include: * twisted-pair cables, shielded and unshielded * microstrip and stripline differential pair routing techniques on printed circuit boards Differential pairs generally carry differential or semi-differential signals, such as high-speed digital serial interfaces including LVDS differential ECL, PECL, LVPECL, Hypertransport, Ethernet over twisted pair, Serial Digital Interface, RS-422, RS-485, USB, Serial ATA, TMDS, FireWire, and HDMI etc. or else high quality and/or high frequency analog signals (e.g., video signals, balanced audio signals, etc.). === Data rates of some interfaces implemented with differential pairs === * Serial ATA 1.5 Gbit/s * Hypertransport 1.6 Gbit/s * Infiniband 2.5 Gbit/s * PCI Express 2.5 Gbit/s * Serial ATA Revision 2.0 2.4 Gbit/s * XAUI 3.125 Gbit/s * Serial ATA Revision 3.0 6 Gbit/s * PCI Express 2.0 5.0 Gbit/s per lane * 10 Gigabit Ethernet 10 Gbit/s (4 differential pairs running at 2.5 Gbit/s each) * DDR SDRAM 3.2 Gbit/s (differential strobes latch single-ended data) == Transmission lines == The type of transmission line that connects two devices (chips, modules) dictates the type of signaling. Single-ended signaling is used with coaxial cables, in which one conductor totally screens the other from the environment. All screens (or shields) are combined into a single piece of material to form a common ground. Differential signaling is used with a balanced pair of conductors. For short cables and low frequencies, the two methods are equivalent, so cheap single-ended circuits with a common ground can be used with cheap cables. As signaling speeds become faster, wires begin to behave as transmission lines. == Use in computers == Differential signaling is often used in computers to reduce electromagnetic interference, because complete screening is not possible with microstrips and chips in computers, due to geometric constraints and the fact that screening does not work at DC. If a DC power supply line and a low-voltage signal line share the same ground, the power current returning through the ground can induce a significant voltage in it. A low-resistance ground reduces this problem to some extent. A balanced pair of microstrip lines is a convenient solution, because it does not need an additional PCB layer, as a stripline does. Because each line causes a matching image current in the ground plane, which is required anyway for supplying power, the pair looks like four lines and therefore has a shorter crosstalk distance than a simple isolated pair. In fact, it behaves as well as a twisted pair. Low crosstalk is important when many lines are packed into a small space, as on a typical PCB. == High-voltage differential signaling == High-voltage differential (HVD) signaling uses high-voltage signals. In computer electronics, \\"high voltage\\" normally means 5 volts or more. SCSI-1 variations included a high voltage differential (HVD) implementation whose maximum cable length was many times that of the single- ended version. SCSI equipment for example allows a maximum total cable length of 25 meters using HVD, while single-ended SCSI allows a maximum cable length of 1.5 to 6 meters, depending on bus speed. LVD versions of SCSI allow less than 25 m cable length not because of the lower voltage, but because these SCSI standards allow much higher speeds than the older HVD SCSI. The generic term high-voltage differential signaling describes a variety of systems. Low- voltage differential signaling or LVDS, on the other hand, is a specific system defined by a TIA/EIA standard. ==See also== *Backplanes *Current loop signaling *Current mode logic (CML) *DDR2 SDRAM *Differential amplifier *Differential TTL *DisplayPort *Longitudinal voltage *Signal integrity *Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS) *Humbucker == References == Category:Computer buses Category:Communication circuits Category:Telecommunications engineering ja:差動信号 ","title":"Differential signaling"},{"id":"1423259","text":"Joseph Victor Gomez Ejercito (born December 26, 1969), commonly known as JV Ejercito or JV Ejercito Estrada, is a Filipino politician and legislator who served as a Senator of the Phlippines, he is the son of former Philippine president Joseph Estrada. Ejercito first served as Mayor of San Juan from 2001 to 2010 before running and winning a seat in the congress for one term in 2010 serving up to 2013. After finishing his only term as a Congressman, he ran immediately and won a bid in the Senate in 2013. Ejercito credits himself as the author of the Universal Health Care Act of the Philippines. == Early life == Joseph Victor \\"JV\\" G. Ejercito was born December 26, 1969 to the then newly elected San Juan City Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada and businesswoman and now current mayor of San Juan, Guia Gomez. == Education == He attended Xavier School for his primary and secondary education and completed his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science at De La Salle University. == Political career == === San Juan mayor === Ejercito served as mayor of San Juan City for three consecutive terms from 2001 to 2010. === House of Representatives === During the 2010 elections, Ejercito ran for the position of congressman for the lone district of San Juan. Over the course of his term, Ejercito authored and/or sponsored 161 bills and/or House measures, five of which were approved by the House and passed to the Senate for consideration: *HB 4225: Participatory Governance Through CSOs Empowerment Act of 2011 *HB 4541: Mercury Exposure Information Act of 2011 *HB 4565: Local Housing Boards Act *HB 5870: Cadastral Survey Act of 2012 *HB 6144: Domestic Workers Act of 2012 or Kasambahay Bill === Senate === On October 1, 2012, Ejercito filed his certificate of candidacy for the 2013 Philippine senate elections, in which he won as the eleventh out of twelve of the senators elected. During his six years in the Senate, Ejercito filed a total of 140 bills and resolutions. Ejercito also chaired the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Urban Planning, Housing and Resettlement and the Health and the Demography Committee in the 17th Congress. On April 6, 2016, Sandiganbayan Fifth Division issued an arrest warrant against Ejercito and four other government officials, in connection with allegations on misuse of funds during his term as San Juan City mayor. However, Ejercito was cleared of the charges because the case was dismissed. Ejercito ran and launched a campaign to secure a second consecutive-term in the 2019 Philippine Senate election, his candidacy was endorsed by President Rodrigo Duterte. His brother, former Senator Jinggoy, who was previously jailed & charged with multiple counts of plunder in 2014, also sought a Senate return. During the campaign, the siblings had a disagreement in the idea of them running at the same time, Ejercito expressed that Estrada running would \\"ruin his chances\\", he also threw shade against Estrada as he referred himself as \\"The Good One\\" in political ads. After conceding defeat, his brother Jinggoy wished that Senator Nancy Binay would make it over Ejercito, with both senators vying for the last spot in the partial and unofficial count, Ejercito responded by telling Estrada that he placed 13th in his own hometown, “Let him speak... It’s painful to accept that even in your own bailiwick you are unwanted,\\". Eventually, the siblings both lost as Ejercito ended up in 13th place, just a spot outside the winning circle, while Estrada finished at 15th place. == Personal life == He is married to Hyacinth \\"Cindy\\" Lotuaco with whom he has a son, Julio Jose. He also has an older son, Jose Emilio. Joseph Victor is also a Commissioned Reserve Officer of the Philippine Marine Corps with the rank of Major. He is an adopted member of the Philippine Military Academy Class of '88, Maringal. Ejercito has a tattoo on his right arm: A red eight- rayed sun with the baybayin character for ka at the center, and the phrase Para sa Bayan (\\"For the country\\") and the letter \\"K\\" on top of the sun.

It is a sixteenth-century country house, best known for its twentieth-century owner, Charles Paget Wade, an eccentric who amassed an enormous collection of objects that interested him. He gave the property to the National Trust in 1951, and his collection is still housed there. == Manor house == The property is located in Snowshill. It is a typical Cotswold manor house, made from local stone; the main part of the house dates from the 16th century. It is a Grade II* listed building, having been so designated since 4 July 1960. Also listed are the brewhouse, the dovecote, some of the garden buildings, the wall and gate-piers, and the group of four Manor Cottages. ==History== Snowshill Manor was given to Winchcombe Abbey in 821 by King Coenwulf of Mercia. Two hundred and sixty four years later, the village and Manor were listed in the Domesday Book (1085) as Snawesille, property of the Abbey of Saint Mary of Winchcombe. The Manor remained the property of the Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 when it was confiscated by King Henry VIII, who included the Manor in his dowry to his last queen, Catherine Parr, in 1543. The earliest surviving part of the Manor, the rooms named and now known as Dragon, Nadir, Ann's, Music and Seraphim by Charles Paget Wade, was built around 1550 and it is probable that this section of the Manor was joined to a contemporaneous building to the south, which was later demolished. In the 1600s the Manor was again extended southwards and attic rooms added. In the early part of the 18th century the house was owned by one William Sambach, who added extra rooms on the south- west corner in about 1720. He also added a new main door in the south front, placing the Sambach coat of arms in the pediment above it, which is now the main entrance to the house. After several further changes of owner, John Small of Clapham took over the property, being the first of a series of absentee landlords: for the next 150 years the house was occupied by tenant farmers, until its purchase in 1919 by Charles Paget Wade. Wade was an architect, artist-craftsman, collector, poet and heir to the family fortune. He restored the property, living in the small cottage in the garden and using the Manor house as a home for his collection of objects. By the time of his death he had amassed over 22,000 objects. He gave the property and the contents of this collection to the National Trust in 1951. == Collections == The house contains an eclectic collection of thousands of objects, gathered over the years by Charles Paget Wade, whose motto was \\"Let nothing perish\\". The collection includes toys, Samurai armour, musical instruments, and clocks. Today, the main attraction of the house is perhaps the display of Wade's collection. From 1900 until 1951, when he gave the Manor to the National Trust, Wade amassed an enormous and eclectic collection of objects reflecting his interest in craftsmanship. The objects in the collection include 26 suits of Japanese samurai armour dating from the 17th and 19th centuries, bicycles, toys, musical instruments, and more. == Priest's House == Wade was an eccentric man and lived in the Priest's House while housing his collection in the manor. It is said to be haunted by a monk, and by the ghost of a young woman forced in 1604 to marry against her will in one of the upstairs rooms. == Garden == The garden at Snowshill was laid out by Wade, in collaboration with Arts and Crafts movement architect, M. H. Baillie Scott, between 1920 and 1923. Their elaborate layout resembles a series of outside rooms seen as an extension to the house. Features include terraces and ponds, and the gardens demonstrate Wade's fascination with colours and scents. As well as formal beds, the gardens include an ancient dovecote, a model village, kitchen garden, orchards and small fields with sheep. == References == Category:Country houses in Gloucestershire Category:National Trust properties in Gloucestershire Category:Historic house museums in Gloucestershire Category:Gardens in Gloucestershire Category:Museums in Gloucestershire Category:Toy museums in England Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Gloucestershire ","title":"Snowshill Manor"},{"id":"1423272","text":"Sergio \\"Serging\\" Veloso Osmeña Jr. (December 4, 1916 – March 26, 1984) was a Senator of the Philippines, and ran against Ferdinand Marcos in the 1969 Philippine Presidential election. He was the son of Sergio Osmeña, the fourth President of the Philippines. His son in turn was Sergio \\"Serge\\" Osmeña III, who also became a Senator of the Philippines. ==Early life== Osmeña was born in Cebu City on December 4, 1916, to former Philippine President Sergio Osmeña Sr. and Estefania Chiong Veloso. He has a brother named Emilio Osmeña, father of Emilio Mario Osmeña Jr. and John Henry Osmeña. He graduated Associate of Arts, cum laude, from Ateneo de Manila University on 1935, and Bachelor of Science in Commerce, summa cum laude, from New York University in 1936. After graduating which Osmeña opened an import-export business in New York. ==Actions in World War II== Osmeña was accused of collaborating with the Japanese in World War II. He overcame the charges and returned to the Philippines and became President of the De La Rama Steamship Co. ==Political career== In 1951, he was elected provincial governor of Cebu and Mayor of Cebu City for three terms in 1955, 1959 and 1963. Elected as representative for the second district of Cebu in 1958, his notable work as fiscalizer brought him recognition from the Congressional Press Club which voted him as one of the Ten Most Outstanding Congressmen of 1959. In 1961, Osmeña ran for Vice President of the Philippines as an independent, but lost to Senator Emmanuel Pelaez. In the November 1965 elections, he won a seat in the Philippine Senate. ===1969 Philippine Presidential election=== Osmeña publicly opposed the Marcos administration. On April 5th 1969, at the St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, Marcos accused Osmeña of collaborating with the Japanese in World War II. Later on June 15, Osmeña won the Liberal Party nomination for President of the Philippines, and would run against incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos for the 1969 Philippine presidential election. It was an election regarded as the \\"dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt\\" in Philippine history. Marcos spent $50 million USD in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate. This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972. Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osmena spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone. The Marcos administration conducted vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching. Marcos also used the Armed Forces of the Philippines to disseminate his campaign propaganda. ===Subsequent activities=== Following his presidential loss, Osmeña continued as a leader in the Liberal Party. On August 21, 1971 Osmeña along with prominent members of the Liberal Party held a proclamation rally at the Plaza Miranda in Quiapo. While on stage with the other Liberal leaders, two hand grenades were thrown onto the stage injuring Osmeña. The Plaza Miranda bombing, injured 95, including Osmeña, and killed 9. Afterwards, Osmeña left for the United States and lived in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. Marcos proclaimed martial law in September 1972 and submitted documents to the U.S. Congress. The documents were regarded as bizarre, in addition to a \\"communist threat\\" of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the \\"rebellion\\" of the Muslim Independence Movement, the documents charged that declaration of martial law was also due to a plot to kill Marcos. Osmeña was accused of being a key figure in the plot, though no formal charges were filed against him. ==Personal life== He was married to Lourdes de la Rama of Negros Occidental with whom he had five children: Sergio Osmeña III; María Victoria Osmeña; Esteban Osmeña; Tomas Osmeña; and Georgia Osmeña. ==Death== Osmeña died of respiratory failure at the age of 67 on March 26, 1984 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:Candidates in the 1969 Philippine presidential election Category:Cebuano people Category:Children of Presidents of the Philippines Category:Deaths from respiratory failure Category:Filipino Roman Catholics Category:Governors of Cebu Category:Independent politicians in the Philippines Category:Liberal Party (Philippines) politicians Category:Mayors of Cebu City Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Cebu Category:New York University Stern School of Business alumni Sergio Category:People from Cebu City Category:Philippine vice-presidential candidates, 1961 Category:Senators of the 6th Congress of the Philippines Category:Senators of the 7th Congress of the Philippines ","title":"Sergio Osmeña Jr."},{"id":"1423277","text":"Man's hand showing yubitsume, with the upper two portions of the little finger having been removed. is a Japanese ritual to atone for offenses to another, a way to be punished or to show sincere apology and remorse to another, by means of amputating portions of one's own little finger. In modern times, it is primarily performed by the yakuza, one of the most prominent Japanese criminal organizations. == Origin == The ritual is thought to have originated with the bakuto, itinerant gamblers who were predecessors of the modern yakuza.Kaplan, D.; Dubro, A: Yakuza, p.14. University of California Press, 2003 If a person was unable to pay off a gambling debt, yubitsume was sometimes considered an alternative form of repayment. In Japanese swordsmanship, or Kendo, the little finger's grip is the tightest on the hilt. A little finger-amputee was therefore unable to grip his sword properly, weakening him in battle and making him more dependent on the protection of his boss. == Ritual details == To perform yubitsume, one lays down a small clean cloth and lays the hand onto the cloth facing down. Using an extremely sharp knife, or tantō, the person cuts off the portion of his left little finger above the top knuckle on the finger or the tip of the finger. He then wraps the severed portion in the cloth and submits the \\"package\\" very graciously to his oyabun (\\"godfather\\" or boss), who is also referred to as a kumicho (patriarch/head of the family). If more offenses are committed, then the person moves on to the next joint of the finger to perform yubitsume. More infractions could mean removing portions of the right little finger when no more joints of the left finger remain. In some cases, a person expelled from a yakuza gang might be required to perform the yubitsume ritual. The finger of the yakuza directly responsible for an offense is called an iki yubi, \\"living finger\\", while the finger of the yakuza that is directly in charge of him is called a shinu yubi, \\"dead finger\\". ==References== ==External links== Category:Yakuza Category:Organized crime terminology Category:Japanese culture Category:Amputations ","title":"Yubitsume"},{"id":"1423278","text":"Johan Ihre Johan Ihre (3 March 1707 - 1 December 1780) was a Swedish philologist and historical linguist. ==Life== Ihre was born in Lund, son of the theologian Thomas Ihre and his spouse Brita Steuchia.

In 1730-1733 he studied abroad, in Oxford, London and Paris. He was in 1734 appointed docent in Uppsala, 1735 librarian at the University Library, and was from 1737 until his death holder of the Skyttean professorship in Eloquence and Government.

The engagement was part of the Duke of Marlborough's campaign to save the Habsburg capital of Vienna from a threatened advance by King Louis XIV's Franco-Bavarian forces ranged in southern Germany. Marlborough had commenced his march from Bedburg, near Cologne, on 19 May; within five weeks he had linked his forces with those of the Margrave of Baden, before continuing on to the river Danube. Once in southern Germany, the Allies' task was to induce Max Emanuel, the Elector of Bavaria, to abandon his allegiance to Louis XIV and rejoin the Grand Alliance; but to force the issue, the Allies first needed to secure a fortified bridgehead and magazine on the Danube, through which their supplies could cross to the south of the river into the heart of the Elector's lands. For this purpose, Marlborough selected the town of Donauwörth. Once the Elector and his co-commander, Marshal Marsin, knew of the Allies' objective, they dispatched Count d'Arco with an advance force of 12,000 men from their main camp at Dillingen to strengthen and hold the Schellenberg heights above the town. Rejecting a protracted siege, Marlborough decided in favour of a quick assault, before the position could be made impregnable. After two failed attempts to storm the barricades, the Allied commanders, acting in unison, finally managed to overwhelm the defenders. It had taken just two hours to secure the bridgehead over the river in a hard-fought contest, but following the victory, momentum was lost to indecision. The deliberate devastation of the Elector's lands in Bavaria failed to bring Max Emanuel to battle or persuade him back into the Imperial fold. Only when Marshal Tallard arrived with reinforcements to strengthen the Elector's forces, and Prince Eugene of Savoy arrived from the Rhine to bolster the Allies, was the stage finally set for the decisive action at the Battle of Blenheim the following month. == Background == The Battle of Schellenberg was part of the Grand Alliance's campaign of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400 km) march from Bedburg near Cologne towards the Elector of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders – Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine – into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle farther to the north. However, when the Elector was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's march from the Low Countries, he had correctly predicted that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 173. The Duke of Marlborough's march from Bedburg (near Cologne) to the Danube. His march was a masterpiece of deception, meticulous planning and organisation. Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I was keen to lure the Elector back into the Imperial fold after he had switched allegiance to fight for King Louis XIV before the war. Given this duplicity, Marlborough thought the best way to secure Bavaria for the Alliance was to negotiate from a position of strength by invading the Elector's territories, hoping to persuade him to change sides before he could be reinforced.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 356. An agent of the King of Prussia was still in the Bavarian camp, negotiating with the elector for this purpose. By 22 June Marlborough's army had linked up with elements of the Margrave of Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim; by the end of June their combined strength totalled nearly 80,000 men (see map on right). The Franco-Bavarian army camped at Ulm were numerically inferior to the Allies, and a large part of the Elector's troops were scattered about garrisons in his territories as far as Munich and the Tyrolese frontier, but his position was far from desperate: if he could hold out for a month, Tallard would arrive from the Rhine with French reinforcements.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 355. Once the Allies had combined their forces, the Elector and Marsin moved their 40,000 troops into the entrenched camp between Dillingen and Lauingen on the north bank of the Danube. The Allied commanders – unwilling to attack such a strong position rendered impregnable by redoubts and inundations – passed round Dillingen to the north through Balmershofen and Armerdingen in the direction of Donauwörth. If captured, the bridgehead at Donauwörth (overlooked by the Schellenberg) would offer new communications with the friendly states in central Germany by way of Nördlingen and Nuremberg, as well as providing a good crossing-place over the Danube for re-supply when the Allies were south of the river. == English Forces == The English regiments engaged in the battle were (unless stated, 'regiments' contained only 1 battalion): * King's Regiment of Carabiniers * Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons (Scottish) * James Wynne's Regiment of Dragoons (Irish) * Queen's Regiment of Horse * Earl of Plymouth's Horse * Duke of Shrewsbury's Regiment of Horse * Lord Cavendish's Regiment of Horse * Unknown Battalion from 1st Regiment of Foot Guards * 1st & 2nd Battalions, Earl of Dumbarton's Regiment of Foot (Scottish) * Prince George of Denmark's Regiment of Foot * Princess Anne of Denmark's Regiment of Foot * Earl of Bath's Regiment of Foot * Sir William Clifton's Regiment of Foot * Archibald Douglas's Regiment of Foot * Earl of Granard's Regiment of Foot (Irish) * Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot (Scottish) * Lord Herbert's Regiment of Foot * Sir Edward Dering's Regiment of Foot * Earl of Angus's Regiment of Foot (Scottish) * Thomas Meredith's Regiment of Foot (Irish) == Prelude == === Schellenberg's defences === The Schellenberg heights dominate the skyline to the northeast of Donauwörth – the walled town on the confluence of the Wörnitz and Danube rivers. With one flank of the hill protected by dense, impenetrable trees of the Boschberg wood, and the river Wörnitz and marshes protecting its southern and western quarters, the Schellenberg heights offer a commanding position for any defender. However, its oval shaped summit was flat and open, and its 70-year-old defences, including an old fort built by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War, were neglected and in a dilapidated state. When the unexpected attack took place the bastions, the curtain, and the ditch were fairly complete along the long eastern face from the shore of the Danube to the wooded hilltop, but in the shorter section from the wood to the fort – the angle where Marlborough's attack was delivered – the earthwork had been more hastily made up of fascines of brushwood thinly covered with soil. The western section of the lines ran steeply downhill from the fort to the city walls. Here, there was little to show in terms of defences, but to compensate the line could be protected by a flanking fire from the town.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 357. (See 'Schellenberg' map below.) In 1703 Marshal Villars had advised the Elector to fortify his towns, \\"... and above all the Schellenberg, that fort above Donauwörth, the importance of which the great Gustavus taught us.\\"Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 787. The Elector, whose relationship with Villars had since collapsed, had initially ignored the advice to repair the decaying defences, but once it was realised that Donauwörth was to be attacked, Count d'Arco, a Piedmontese officer, was despatched from the camp at Dillingen with orders to strengthen and hold the position. D'Arco was entrusted with 12,000 men, most of whom were drawn from Bavaria's best units including the Elector's Guards and the regiment of the Prince Electoral, led by veteran officers. In total, the garrison defending the Schellenberg consisted of 16 Bavarian and seven French infantry battalions, six squadrons of French and three squadrons of Bavarian dragoons, supported by 16 guns. In addition, Donauwörth was held by a French battalion and two battalions of Bavarian militia.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 29. === Initial manoeuvres === Protagonists march to the Schellenberg June/July 1704. On the night of 1–2 July, the Allies were camped at Armerdingen, from Donauwörth. It was here when Marlborough received an urgent message from Baron Moltenburg, Prince Eugene's Adjutant-General, that Marshal Tallard was marching with 35,000 troops through the Black Forest to reinforce the Franco-Bavarian army. This news convinced Marlborough that he did not have time for a protracted siege and, despite protestations from Baden – arguing that a direct assault would incur severe casualties – the Duke planned for an outright assault on the position. D'Arco knew of the whereabouts of the Allied camp at Armerdingen, and was confident he had at least a full day and night to prepare his defences. At 03:00 on 2 July the Allied advance guard began to break camp for the march towards Donauwörth and the Schellenberg heights.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 176. Marlborough personally oversaw the advance of the initial assault force of 5,850 foot, drawn up in groups of approximately 130 men from each battalion under his command. The Dutch General Johan Wijnand van Goor would lead this vanguard. Behind these stormers came 12,000 Allied infantry in two echelons, each of eight battalions (English, Dutch, Hanoverian and Hessian) under Major General Henry Withers and Count Horn, supported by Henry Lumley's and Graf Reynard van Hompesch's 35 squadrons of British and Dutch cavalry and dragoons. Baden, whose wing of the army marched behind Marlborough's, would hold a brigade of Imperial grenadiers ready for action when the opportunity came as there was insufficient room in front of the Schellenberg for them to fully deploy. In all, the Allies were deploying 22,000 men in the operation. Riding far ahead of the army Marlborough personally examined the enemy position, observing through his telescope preparations for a camp on the far side of the river in expectation of the arrival of the Elector's main force the following day.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 359. There was, therefore, no time to be lost. Although the Duke had 12 hours of light remaining in the day his men were still struggling in the mud, miles away behind the river Wörnitz, and they could not hope to launch the attack before about 18:00, leaving just two hours before nightfall.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 793. According to Winston Churchill there was no doubt that nearly all the generals on both sides thought it inadmissible for the Allies to fight a battle before 3 July. As the Allies marched, work on the defences of Donauwörth and the Schellenberg were proceeding in earnest. With the aid of French engineer officers d'Arco started to repair and strengthen the of old entrenchments that connected the fort of Gustavus with the Danube on one side, and the town walls on the other. A French commander in Bavarian service and chronicler of the period, Colonel Jean Martin de la Colonie, later wrote – \\"The time left to us was too short to complete this satisfactorily.\\"La Colonie: Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 1692–1717, 179. The Allied cavalry began to appear at about 08:00, or away on d'Arco's left front to the north- west, followed by the infantry. By 10:00 Marlborough's Quartermaster-General, William Cadogan, began to mark out land for an encampment within sight of the Schellenberg – short of the Wörnitz – to give the impression they were intending a leisurely siege.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 795. Count d'Arco watched Cadogan's preparations and, falling for the deception, left the supervision of the still incomplete defences to lunch with the French commander of Donauwörth, Colonel DuBordet, safe in the belief that he had the rest of the day and night to finish the defences.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 177. However, the columns marched purposefully onwards, and by mid- afternoon they had crossed the river Wörnitz at Ebermorgen, intent on launching an immediate assault. The Allies were spotted by the Bavarian outposts who, after setting fire to Berg and surrounding hamlets, rushed off to sound the alarm. General d'Arco, rudely interrupted from his lunch, rushed up the Schellenberg and called his men to arms.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 33. == Battle == === Marlborough's first assault === Sir Godfrey Kneller. The English duke favoured a head-on assault of the Schellenberg but Prince Louis of Baden preferred a protracted siege. Although Marlborough knew a frontal attack on the Schellenberg would be costly, he was convinced that it was the only way of securing the speedy capture of the town: unless he captured the summit by nightfall, it would never be taken – the defences would be too strong, and the main Franco- Bavarian army, which was hastening from Dillingen towards Donauwörth, would arrive to defend the position. A female dragoon, Christian Welsh (she had disguised her true sex) remembered, \\"Our vanguard did not come into sight of the enemy entrenchments til the afternoon; however, not to give the Bavarians time to make themselves yet stronger, the duke ordered the Dutch General Goor ... to attack as soon as possible.\\"Christian Davies, known also as Mother Ross or Mrs Davies, had concealed her identity and enlisted in the army as a man in 1693. At about 17:00, as a preliminary to the attack, Marlborough's artillery commander, Colonel Holcroft Blood, pounded the enemy from a position near Berg; each salvo was countered by d'Arco's guns from Gustavus's fort and from just outside the Boschberg wood. Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden (1655–1707). Both Baden and Marlborough considered the battle his own victory.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 212. General d'Arco now ordered de la Colonie's French grenadiers into reserve on top of the Heights (above the breastworks manned by the Bavarians), ready to plug any gaps in their defences at the appropriate time. However, due to the flatness of the summit this position offered his men limited protection from the Allied guns. This exposure was noted by Colonel Blood who, sighting his artillery upon the summit, was able to inflict serious casualties upon de la Colonie's men.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 179. De la Colonie later recorded – \\"They concentrated their fire upon us, and with their first discharge carried off Count de la Bastide ... so that my coat was covered with brains and blood.\\"La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 182. Notwithstanding this barrage, and despite losing five officers and 80 grenadiers before firing a shot, de la Colonie insisted his French regiment stayed at their post, determined as he was to maintain discipline and ensure his troops would be in good order when called into action.La Colonie: Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 1692–1717, 183. De la Colonie. There was just enough time before nightfall to storm the position on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but not enough time to develop simultaneous attacks from other sides.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 360. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 179. Although Mordaunt and Munden survived the day, little more than a handful of the forlorn hope were not killed. Falkner states 17 men of the 'forlorn hope' survived the day. Trevelyan states 11 men survived (including Mordaunt). The main force followed closely behind. \\"The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming\\", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to drown out the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge \\"so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people.\\"La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 184. As the range closed the Allies became easy targets for the Franco-Bavarian musket- and grape-shot; the confusion exacerbated by fizzing hand-grenades thrown down the slope by the defenders.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 34. To aid their assault, each Allied soldier carried a bundle of fascines (earlier cut from the Boschberg wood), with which to bridge the ditches in front of the breastworks to speed their passage. However, the fascines were mistakenly thrown into a dry gully – formed by the recent summer rains – instead of the Bavarians' defensive trench about 45 m (50 yards) farther on. Nevertheless, the Allies continued to push forward, joining battle with the Bavarians in savage hand-to-hand fighting. Behind the defences the Elector's Guards and la Colonie's men bore the brunt of the attack so that, \\"The little parapet which separates the two forces became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that could be conceived.\\" But the assault failed to penetrate the defences, and the Allies were forced to fall back to their lines. General Johan Wijnand van Goor, a favourite of Marlborough who had led the attack, numbered among the Allied fatalities. === Marlborough's second assault === The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue- coated Dutch advanced side by side in perfect order for a second attempt. Requiring from them another concerted effort their general officers personally led the men from the front into a second torrent of musket-shot and grenades.La Colonie states the defenders had 'several wagon loads' of grenades. Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. With broken ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 35. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 362. === Baden's assault === Battle of Schellenberg, 1704. Half an hour after Marlborough attacks the 'death-angle', Baden's forces storm the weakly defended western lines. At this moment, having failed twice to make a breakthrough, Marlborough received intelligence that the defences linking the town walls with the breastwork on the hill were now sparsely manned (Marlborough's unsuccessful attacks had drawn d'Arco's men away from other parts of the stronghold, leaving his left flank almost defenceless and highly vulnerable).Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 36. This intelligence was discovered by a soldier who had drifted off to the right of the attack. De la Colonie states a lieutenant and 20 men were sent off to reconnoitre the area. The other Allied commander, the Margrave of Baden (who had entered the battle half an hour after Marlborough), also noticed this opportunity and was soon hurrying with his grenadiers from the hamlet of Berg, and across the Kaibach stream to assault the position.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 36. Critically, Donauwörth's garrison commander had withdrawn his men inside the town, locked the gates, and could now only offer scattered shots from its walls.La Colonie: Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 1692–717, 187. De la Colonie states the commandant thought this was the best way to secure the town, however \\"... the result was our ruin.\\" Baden's Imperial troops (now supported by eight of Marlborough's reserve battalions), easily breached these weakened defences, defeated the two battalions of infantry and a handful of cavalry still defending the area, and were able to form up at the foot of the Schellenberg, interposing themselves between d'Arco and the town. Noticing the danger d'Arco hurried to the rear to summon his dismounted French dragoons (held back in the lee of the hill) in an attempt to stem the advancing Imperialists marching up the glacis. However, three companies of Baden's grenadiers confronted them with concentrated volleys, forcing the cavalry to retire. This action subsequently left d'Arco out of position and out of contact with his main force fiercely resisting on the crest of the hill. The Franco-Bavarian commander headed for the town and, according to de la Colonie – \\"... had some difficulty in entering owing to the hesitation of the commandant to open the gates.\\"La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, 190. === Breakthrough === Aware that Imperial troops had breached the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring d'Arco's men to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly effectiveness of their musketry and grenades. But the defenders, including la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated their left flank, and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth),Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 182. Spencer states that d'Arco had assumed the rest of his men had preceded him into the town but in this, he was mistaken. were still confident in their ability to repel the enemy – \\"We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and kept our opponents in check.\\" It was not long, however, before the Franco- Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching from the direction of the town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. \\"They [Baden's Imperial grenadiers] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without our being aware of the possibility of such a thing.\\" Wrote de la Colonie. \\"So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post ...\\" After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy at last fell into confusion.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 37. The outnumbered defenders of the Schellenberg had resisted the Allied assaults for two hours, but now under pressure from both Baden's and Marlborough's forces, their stalwart defence was over. As panic spread through the Franco-Bavarian army, Marlborough unleashed 35 squadrons of cavalry and dragoons to pursue the fleeing troops, ruthlessly cutting down the enemy soldiers to the shouts of \\"Kill, kill and destroy!\\"Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 805. There was no easy escape route. A pontoon bridge over the Danube had collapsed under their weight, and many of d'Arco's troops, most of whom could not swim, drowned trying to cross the fast-flowing river.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 39. Many others who had been cut off on the northern shore of the Danube ran for their lives amongst the reed-beds, vainly endeavouring to avoid the Allied sabres. Others headed for the village of Zirgesheim, straining to escape to the wooded hills beyond. Only to the west could Marlborough detect a few Franco-Bavarian battalions crossing the Danube by Donauwörth's bridge in tolerable order, before darkness descended over the battlefield.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 363. == Aftermath == De la Colonie was one of the few to escape, but the Elector of Bavaria had lost many of his best troops which was to have a profound effect on the ability of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of the campaign. Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 183. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second- in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, overwhelming the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 364. Of the English and Scots engaged every third man had fallen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions of senior officers as they led their men forward in the assaults.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 806. No other action in the War of the Spanish Succession claimed so many lives of senior officers.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 184. The victory produced the usual spoils of war. As well as capturing all the guns on the Schellenberg the Allies captured all the regimental colours (apart from de la Colonie's Grenadiers Rouge Régiment), their ammunition, baggage and other rich booty. But the large casualty figures caused some consternation throughout the Grand Alliance.Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 191. Although the Dutch cast a victory medal showing Baden on the obverse and a Latin inscription on the other side, there was no mention of the Duke of Marlborough.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, 807. Medal inscription reads: The enemy defeated and put to flight and their camp plundered at Schellenberg near Donauwörth, 1704. The Emperor, though, wrote personally to the Duke: \\"Nothing can be more glorious than the celerity and vigour with which ... you forced the camp of the enemy at Donauwörth\\".Spencer: Blenheim: Battle for Europe, 192. With the town abandoned that night by Colonel DuBordet, the Elector, who had arrived within sight of the battle with reinforcements only to see the flight and massacre of his best troops, drew his garrisons out of Neuburg and Ratisbon, and fell back behind the river Lech near Augsburg. === Devastation of Bavaria === Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria (1662–1726). In the style of Sir Anthony van Dyck. Marlborough had won his bridgehead over the Danube, and had put himself between the French and Vienna; yet the battle was followed by a curious, dragging anti- climax.Barnett: Marlborough, 100. The Duke was determined to lure the Elector into battle before Tallard arrived with reinforcements, but since the battle on the Schellenberg neither Allied commander could agree on their next move, resulting in a protracted siege of Rain. Due to the initial lack of heavy guns and ammunition (promised by the Empire but not delivered on time) the town did not fall until 16 July.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 367. The big guns promised Marlborough arrived late, short of ammunition, and the gunners unskilful. La Colonie and the remains of his grenadiers had retired to Rain following their defence of the Schellenberg (Churchill 811). Rain's garrison marched out with full military honours and were permitted to rejoin their army in Augsburg. Nevertheless, Marlborough promptly occupied Neuburg which, together with Donauwörth and Rain, provided the Allies with enough fortified bridges across the Danube and Lech rivers to manoeuvre with ease.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1, 812. The Allied commanders now marched to Friedberg, watching their enemy across the river Lech in Augsburg, at the same time preventing them from entering Bavaria or drawing from it any supplies. But the transfer of Bavaria from the party of the Two Crowns to the Grand Alliance was the prime concern to the Allies. As the Elector sat behind his defences at Augsburg Marlborough sent his troops deep into Bavaria on raids of destruction, burning buildings and destroying crops, trying to lure the Bavarian commander into battle or convince him to change his allegiance back to Emperor Leopold I. The Emperor had offered a full pardon, as well as subsidies and restoration of all his territories, with additional lands of Pfalz-Neuburg and Burgau if he returned to the Imperial fold, but negotiations between the parties were making little headway.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1, 813. It was the Elector's interest to bargain with the Allies for peace, and with France for help. In the words of Churchill, no appeal to France could be so potent as the open threat to change sides. The spoliation of Bavaria led to entreaties from the Elector's wife, Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, for him to divest himself of the French alliance. Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to Louis XIV, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold I and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard's reinforcements – some 35,000 men – would soon be in Bavaria.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 44. Marlborough now intensified the policy of devastating the Elector's territory. On 16 July the Duke wrote to his friend Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, \\"We are advancing into the heart of Bavaria to destroy the country and oblige the Elector one way or the other to a compliance\\".Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 368. The policy compelled the Elector to send 8,000 troops from Augsburg to defend his own property, reserving only a fraction of his army to join the French under Marsin and Tallard.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 370. But although Marlborough thought it a necessary strategy to secure success, it was of doubtful morality. The Duke himself confessed his reservations to his wife, Sarah, \\"This is so uneasy to my nature that nothing but an absolute necessity would have obliged me to consent to it. For these poor people suffer only for their master's ambition.\\" Accounts differ as to the actual amounts of damage done. De La Colonie thought that reports of the devastation were perhaps exaggerated for propaganda purposes; yet Christian Davies serving with Hay's Dragoons wrote, \\"The allies sent parties on every hand to ravage the country ... We spared nothing, killing, burning or otherwise destroying whatever we could not carry off.\\"Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 43. To Historian David Chandler, Marlborough must bear the full responsibility for the destruction, for although he undoubtedly found it hard to stomach it was taken under Baden's, and the Emperor's protests.Chandler: Marlborough as Military Commander, 139. The French, forgetting their destruction of the Palatinate in the Nine Years' War, proclaimed that this barbarism was worthy only of the Turks. (Churchill 823). There are accounts of the 1704 plundering which have been recorded in various churches of Upper Bavaria, such as in Erdweg, Petershausen, Markt Indersdorf and Dachau. The villages of Viehbach and Bachenhausen (near Fahrenzhausen, ca. 30 km north of Munich) also recorded the plundering and fires. When their homes were spared destruction, they swore a vow to forever hold a Mass every year on St. Florian's Day (May 4) to remember their deliverance. The proclamation can still be seen in the old village church in Viehbach. The failure of the Empire to provide an effective siege train had, up to this point, robbed the Allies of victory – neither Munich nor Ulm could be taken, and the Elector had neither been defeated nor compelled to change allegiance.Chandler: Marlborough as Military Commander, 136. The Imperialist siege train had fallen into enemy hands the previous year. Other guns had been held up at Mainz and Nuremberg. When some guns arrived they were, in Churchill's words, 'weak and ill-equipped'. Prince Eugene had become increasingly worried that no decisive action had followed the victory on the Schellenberg, writing to the Duke of Savoy, \\"... I cannot admire their performances. They have been counting on the Elector coming to terms ... they have amused themselves with ... burning a few villages instead of ... marching straight upon the enemy.\\"McKay: Prince Eugene of Savoy, 84. Tallard arrived in Augsburg with French reinforcements on 5 August.Lynn and McKay put this date at 3 August. Eugene, shadowing Tallard, was also heading south with 18,000 men, but he had been forced to leave behind 12,000 troops guarding the Lines of Stollhofen with which to prevent Villeroi bringing further French reinforcements to the Danube.Falkner: Blenheim 1704: Marlborough's Greatest Victory, 44. Falkner states Eugene's reinforcements numbered 20,000. Moreover, the Elector had at last sent orders to the large Bavarian contingents on the Tyrolese border to rejoin the main army. For the Allies, therefore, time was short: they must defeat the French and their allies at once, or all south Germany would be lost.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, 371. On 7 August the three Allied commanders – Marlborough, Baden and Eugene – met to decide their strategy. To give themselves another major crossing over the Danube a plan by Baden to besiege the city of Ingolstadt with a force of 15,000 men was agreed to, despite leaving the Allied army numerically inferior.Holmes: Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius, 279. To Mérode-Westerloo, and subsequent historians, this decision was largely a ploy to remove the cautious and obstructive Baden from the decisive battle. However, to Historian Richard Holmes there was no 'trace of subterfuge' in this decision, and to Marlborough the siege made perfect strategic sense. This army, totalling 52,000 men and now without the commander who led the Imperial troops on the Schellenberg, would meet the Franco- Bavarian forces, numbering 56,000 men, in and around the small village of Blindheim. The engagement, fought on 13 August 1704, would become known in German as the Battle of Höchstädt, and in English, as the Battle of Blenheim. == Cultural references == * Joseph Addison's poem The Campaign == Notes == Explanatory notes Citations == References == === Primary === * La Colonie, Jean Martin de (1904).

The battle is notable for having been fought largely on the frozen lake, which gave the battle its name. A significant defeat was sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades, which were directed against pagans and Eastern Orthodox Christians rather than Muslims in the Holy Land. The Crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Slavic territories for the next century. The event was glorified in Sergei Eisenstein's historical drama film Alexander Nevsky, released in 1938, which created a popular image of the battle often mistaken for the real events. ==Background== In 1221, Pope Honorius III was again worried about the situation in the Finnish-Novgorodian Wars after receiving alarming information from the Archbishop of Uppsala. He authorized the Bishop of Finland to establish a trade embargo against the \\"barbarians\\" that threatened Christianity in Finland. in 1221. In Latin. The nationality of the \\"barbarians\\", presumably a citation from Archbishop's earlier letter, remains unknown, and was not necessarily known even by the Pope. However, as the trade embargo was widened eight years later, it was specifically said to be against the Russians.See papal letters from 1229 to and . In Latin. Based on Papal letters from 1229,See letters by Pope Gregory IX: , , , , , , . All in Latin. the Bishop of Finland requested the Pope enforce a trade embargo against Novgorodians on the Baltic Sea, at least in Visby, Riga and Lübeck. A few years later, the Pope also requested the Livonian Brothers of the Sword send troops to protect Finland. Whether any knights ever arrived remains unknown.. In Latin. Hoping to exploit Novgorod's weakness in the wake of the Mongol and Swedish invasions, the Teutonic Knights attacked the neighboring Novgorod Republic and occupied Pskov, Izborsk, and Koporye in autumn 1240. When they approached Novgorod itself, the local citizens recalled to the city 20-year-old Prince Alexander Nevsky, whom they had banished to Pereslavl earlier that year. During the campaign of 1241, Alexander managed to retake Pskov and Koporye from the crusaders. Medieval Livonia In the spring of 1242, the Teutonic Knights defeated a detachment of Novgorodians about 20 km south of the fortress of Dorpat (Tartu). Led by Prince-Bishop Hermann of Dorpat, the knights and their auxiliary troops of local Ugaunian Estonians then met with Alexander's forces by the narrow strait (Lake Lämmijärv or Teploe) that connects the north and south parts of Lake Peipus (Lake Peipus proper with Lake Pskovskoye). ==Battle== On April 5, 1242, Alexander, intending to fight in a place of his own choosing, retreated in an attempt to draw the often over-confident Crusaders onto the frozen lake. Estimates on the number of troops in the opposing armies vary widely among scholars. A more conservative estimation has it that the crusader forces likely numbered around 2,600, including 800 Danish and German knights, 100 Teutonic knights, 300 Danes, 400 Germans, and 1,000 Estonian infantry. The Russians fielded around 5,000 men: Alexander and his brother Andrei's bodyguards (druzhina), totalling around 1,000, plus 2,000 militia of Novgorod, 1,400 Finno-Ugrian tribesmen, and 600 horse archers. The Teutonic knights and crusaders charged across the lake and reached the enemy, but were held up by the infantry of the Novgorod militia. This caused the momentum of the crusader attack to slow. The battle was fierce, with the allied Russians fighting the Teutonic and crusader troops on the frozen surface of the lake. After a little more than two hours of close quarters fighting, Alexander ordered the left and right wings of his army (including cavalry) to enter the battle. The Teutonic and crusader troops by that time were exhausted from the constant struggle on the slippery surface of the frozen lake. The Crusaders started to retreat in disarray deeper onto the ice, and the appearance of the fresh Novgorod cavalry made them retreat in panic. It is commonly said that \\"the Teutonic knights and crusaders attempted to rally and regroup at the far side of the lake, however, the thin ice began to give way and cracked under the weight of their heavy armour, and many knights and crusaders drowned\\"; but Donald Ostrowski in Alexander Nevskii’s \\"Battle on the Ice\\": The Creation of a Legend contends that the part about the ice breaking and people drowning was a relatively recent embellishment to the original historical story. He cites a large number of scholars who have written about the battle, Karamzin, Solovev, Petrushevskii, Khitrov, Platonov, Grekov, Vernadsky, Razin, Myakotin, Pashuto, Fennell, and Kirpichnikov, none of whom mention the ice breaking up or anyone drowning when discussing the battle on the ice. After analysing all the sources Ostrowski concludes that the part about ice breaking and drowning appeared first in the 1938 film Alexander Nevsky by Sergei Eisenstein. ==Casualties== Battle of the Ice anniversary, 750 years.

The knights' defeat at the hands of Alexander's forces prevented the crusaders from retaking Pskov, the linchpin of their eastern crusade. The Novgorodians succeeded in defending Russian territory, and the crusaders never mounted another serious challenge eastward. Alexander was canonised as a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1574. The event was glorified in Sergei Eisenstein's patriotic historical drama film Alexander Nevsky, released in 1938. The movie, bearing propagandist allegories of the Teutonic Knights as Nazi Germans, with the Teutonic infantry wearing modified World War I German Stahlhelm helmets, has created a popular image of the battle often mistaken for the real events. In particular, the image of knights dying by breaking the ice and drowning originates from the film. Sergei Prokofiev turned his score for the film into a concert cantata of the same title, the longest movement of which is \\"The Battle on the Ice\\". During World War II, the image of Alexander Nevsky became a national Russian symbol of the struggle against German occupation. The Order of Alexander Nevsky was re-established in the Soviet Union in 1942 during the Great Patriotic War. Since 2010, the Russian government has given out an Order of Alexander Nevsky (originally introduced by Catherine I of Russia in 1725) given for outstanding bravery and excellent service to the country. In 1983, a revisionist view proposed by historian John L. I. Fennell argued that the battle was not as important, nor as large, as has often been portrayed. Fennell claimed that most of the Teutonic Knights were by that time engaged elsewhere in the Baltic, and that the apparently low number of knights' casualties according to their own sources indicates the smallness of the encounter. He also says that neither the Suzdalian chronicle (the Lavrent'evskiy), nor any of the Swedish sources mention the occasion, which according to him would mean that the 'great battle' was little more than one of many periodic clashes.John Fennell, The Crisis of Medieval Russia 1200–1304, (London: Longman, 1983), 106. Russian historian Alexander Uzhankov suggested that Fennell distorted the picture by ignoring many historical facts and documents. To stress the importance of the battle, he cites two papal bulls of Gregory IX, promulgated in 1233 and 1237, which called for a crusade to protect Christianity in Finland against her neighbours. The first bull explicitly mentions Russia. The kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark and the Teutonic Order built up an alliance in June 1238, under the auspices of Danish king Valdemar II. They assembled the larger western cavalry force of their time. Another point mentioned by Uzhankov is the 1243 treaty between Novgorod and the Teutonic Order, where the knights abandoned all claims to Russian lands. Uzhankov also emphasizes, with respect to the scale of battle, that for each knight deployed on the field there were eight to 30 combatants, counting squires, archers and servants (though at his stated ratios, that would still make the Teutonic losses number at most a few hundred).Александр Ужанков.

Interning strings makes some string processing tasks more time- or space-efficient at the cost of requiring more time when the string is created or interned. The distinct values are stored in a string intern pool. The single copy of each string is called its intern and is typically looked up by a method of the string class, for example String.intern() in Java. All compile-time constant strings in Java are automatically interned using this method. String interning is supported by some modern object-oriented programming languages, including Java, Python, PHP (since 5.4), Lua, Ruby (with its symbols), Julia and .NET languages. Lisp, Scheme, and Smalltalk are among the languages with a symbol type that are basically interned strings. The library of the Standard ML of New Jersey contains an \`atom\` type that does the same thing. Objective-C's selectors, which are mainly used as method names, are interned strings. Objects other than strings can be interned. For example, in Java, when primitive values are boxed into a wrapper object, certain values (any \`boolean\`, any \`byte\`, any \`char\` from 0 to 127, and any \`short\` or \`int\` between −128 and 127) are interned, and any two boxing conversions of one of these values are guaranteed to result in the same object. ==History== Lisp introduced the notion of interned strings for its symbols. Historically, the data structure used as a string intern pool was called an oblist (when it was implemented as a linked list) or an obarray (when it was implemented as an array). Modern Lisp dialects typically distinguish symbols from strings; interning a given string returns an existing symbol or creates a new one, whose name is that string. Symbols often have additional properties that strings do not (such as storage for associated values, or namespacing): the distinction is also useful to prevent accidentally comparing an interned string with a not-necessarily- interned string, which could lead to intermittent failures depending on usage patterns. ==Motivation== String interning speeds up string comparisons, which are sometimes a performance bottleneck in applications (such as compilers and dynamic programming language runtimes) that rely heavily on associative arrays with string keys to look up the attributes and methods of an object. Without interning, comparing two distinct strings may involve examining every character of both.The string comparison can halt at the first character mismatch. For strict equality, the lengths of the strings can also be compared before traversing the string: but finding the length of null-terminated strings does itself require traversing the string. This is slow for several reasons: it is inherently O(n) in the length of the strings; it typically requires reads from several regions of memory, which take time; and the reads fill up the processor cache, meaning there is less cache available for other needs. With interned strings, a simple object identity test suffices after the original intern operation; this is typically implemented as a pointer equality test, normally just a single machine instruction with no memory reference at all. String interning also reduces memory usage if there are many instances of the same string value; for instance, it is read from a network or from storage. Such strings may include magic numbers or network protocol information. For example, XML parsers may intern names of tags and attributes to save memory. Network transfer of objects over Java RMI serialization object streams can transfer strings that are interned more efficiently, as the String object's handle is used in place of duplicate objects upon serialization. ==Issues== ===Multithreading=== One source of drawbacks is that string interning may be problematic when mixed with multithreading. In many systems, string interns are required to be global across all threads within an address space (or across any contexts which may share pointers), thus the intern pool(s) are global resources that should be synchronized for safe concurrent access. While this only affects string creation (where the intern pool must be checked and modified if necessary), and double-checked locking may be used on platforms where this is a safe optimization, the need for mutual exclusion when modifying the intern pool can be expensive. Contention can also be reduced by partitioning the string space into multiple pools, which can be synchronized independently of one another. ===Reclaiming unused interned strings=== Many implementations of interned strings do not attempt to reclaim (manually or otherwise) strings that are no longer used. For applications where the number of interned strings is small or fixed, or which are short- lived, the loss of system resources may be tolerable. But for long-running systems where large numbers of string interns are created at runtime, the need to reclaim unused interns may arise. This task can be handled by a garbage collector, though for this to work correctly weak references to string interns must be stored in the intern pool. ==See also== *Flyweight pattern ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Visual J# String class *.NET String Class *Guava Java Library - Interner - Non-permgen String.intern and supports other immutable types with weak and strong referenced implementations Category:Software optimization Interning ","title":"String interning"},{"id":"1423289","text":"Sunnyside is the name of a neighborhood in the Mid-Island region of the New York City borough of Staten Island. ==History== Sunnyside was originally farmland on either side of Clove Road. As farms gave way to residential housing, the Vanderbilt family built homes in the area, including two which still stand at the corner of Victory Boulevard and Clove Road. The area was once known as Clove Valley or Clovenia, and then adopted the name Sunnyside from a boarding house that was established there in 1889. Prior to the advent of cable television service, Sunnyside was noted for having the worst television reception on Staten Island. This resulted from its being hemmed in by several hills, including Grymes Hill, Emerson Hill and Castleton Hill, the latter separating Sunnyside from neighboring Castleton Corners. Sunnyside was once the home of a campus of the College of Staten Island, located at the foot of Emerson Hill. In 1993 this campus was moved to the grounds of the former Willowbrook State School, and an advanced-placement high school, the Michael J. Petrides School, took its place. This center is also an evacuation site for residents during floods or other emergencies. Sunnyside Hospital was located on Little Clove Road and Ontario Avenue, but was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Staten Island Expressway (I-278). A large percentage of Sunnyside's residents are civil service workers, this demographic trait being typical of many Mid-Island neighborhoods. ==Parks and boundaries== Sunnyside is situated amid several large city parks: Clove Lakes Park and Silver Lake Park to the north, and Deere Park to the south. Slosson Avenue forms an unofficial western boundary, separating Sunnyside from Castleton Corners. Clove Road and Ocean Terrace approximate an eastern boundary, separating Sunnyside from Grymes Hill and Emerson Hill. ==Transportation== Sunnyside is served by the local buses and the express buses. ==See also== *Independence Manor ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island ","title":"Sunnyside, Staten Island"},{"id":"1423292","text":"MK Electric is a company that makes electrical accessories.

After he qualified as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1907, he went to work for Raymond Unwin, one of the founders of the architectural partnership of Parker and Unwin, major proponents of the Arts and Crafts Movement. There he worked with M.H. Baillie Scott, to whom he would later turn for help in designing the gardens at Snowshill Manor. In 1911 Wade's father died and he inherited a share in the family business based on sugar estates on the island of St Kitts in the West Indies. After service in France during World War I, Wade purchased the estate at Snowshill in 1919, first restoring the Manor House and laying out the gardens from 1920 to 1923. Having started collecting at the age of 7, Wade eventually built up a collection of more than 22000 items of furniture, clothing, paintings, and many other pieces which reflected his interest in colour, design and good craftsmanship. He housed the collection in the Manor House at Snowshill, choosing to live in a small cottage in the garden. He continued to add to his collection over the years. Wade married in 1946. His spouse, Mary McEwan Gore Graham (1902–1999), was working in the nearby village of Broadway during World War II when she first visited Snowshill Manor in 1945. After the marriage they spent increasingly greater amounts of time at their house in the West Indies. Wade gave the estate to the National Trust in 1951. He died in 1956 during a visit to England and is buried in the village churchyard with other members of his family.

He served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1872 to 1884. ==Background and education== Brand was the second son of General Henry Trevor, 21st Baron Dacre, who inherited the barony in 1851, second son of Thomas Brand and Gertrude Roper, 19th Baroness Dacre. His mother was Pyne, daughter of the Very Reverend the Hon. Maurice Crosbie, Dean of Limerick, son of the 1st Lord Brandon (Brandon's wife was a granddaughter of Sir William Petty, FRS). He descended, almost directly, from Colonel John Hampden, \\"the Patriot\\"; his forebear, Sir John Trevor III (1624–72) of Plas Teg, son of Sir John Trevor II of Plas Teg and Trevalun, by Anne daughter of Sir Edmund Hampden of Wendover, had married John Hampden's daughter Ruth, who was his first cousin. That is to say the 19th Baron Dacre (aka Gertrude Roper (d.1819) wife to Thomas Brand V (1749–94)) was the great-great-granddaughter of The Patriot. He was educated at Eton and was a member of Brook's, Reform and Athenaeum clubs. Brand was in the Coldstream Guards for 12 years, from 20 April 1832 until 6 September 1844. He was their 963rd officer. His father, the General, had been their 690th officer serving 28 years between 1793 and 1821. ==Political career== Hampden's autograph and photograph published by George Potter in 1891. Brand entered parliament as a Liberal in 1852, sat for Cambridgeshire, and for some time was Chief Whip of his party. He was a Lord of the Treasury during the first Palmerston ministry, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury during the second. At some point he was Keeper of the Privy Seal to the Prince of Wales. In 1872 he was elected speaker, and retained this post till February 1884. It fell to him to deal with the systematic obstruction of the Irish Nationalist Party, and his speakership is memorable for his action on 2 February 1881 in refusing further debate on W. E. Forster's Coercion Bill—a step which led to the formal introduction of the closure into parliamentary procedure. He was appointed a GCB in 1881 and on his retirement he was created Viscount Hampden, of Glynde in the County of Sussex. In 1890 he also succeeded in the barony of Dacre on the death of his brother. ==Estates== According to John Bateman, who derived his information from statistics published in 1873, Hon. Sir Henry Bouverie William Brand, G.C.B., of Glynde, Lewes, had 8,846 acres in Sussex (worth 8,121 guineas per annum). ==Family== Lord Hampden married Eliza (1818-8 March 1899, Pelham House, Lewes), daughter of General Robert Ellice by his wife Eliza Courtney, illegitimate daughter of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey by Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, on 16 April 1838.

The North American blizzard of 2005 was a three-day storm that affected large areas of the northern United States, dropping more than 3 feet (0.9 m) of snow in parts of southeastern Massachusetts, as well as much of the Boston metropolitan area. While this was by far the hardest hit region, it was also a significant snowstorm for the Philadelphia and New York City areas, which both suffered occasional blizzard conditions and 12-15 inch (30–38 cm) snow accumulations. The storm began dropping snow on the upper Midwest on Thursday, January 20, 2005. It slowly moved eastward affecting the Great Lakes region and the Mid-Atlantic states on Friday and Saturday, January 21 and January 22, 2005. On Saturday evening the storm entered the Southern New England area. The strength of the storm, coupled with the extreme Arctic temperatures, created a light, fluffy snow which increased the snowfall totals. The storm shut down Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts and T. F. Green Airport in Rhode Island, while also impairing travel throughout much of Massachusetts due to the high amount of snow covering the roads. Practically all schools in the Metrowest and South East regions of Massachusetts were closed for at least two days. Cape Cod Community College, as well as all public schools on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket were closed for up to a week. After traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, the storm system hit parts of Great Britain and Ireland and the Scandinavian peninsula, causing even more widespread blackouts and a small number of deaths in the region. ==Conditions== Conditions throughout much of eastern Massachusetts were near- whiteout and, in some cases, were whiteout. State Police in both Dartmouth and Middleborough suggested that residents travel as little as possible. Major highways, such as Route 24, Route 6 and Route 140, could not be properly cleared because of the heavy snowfall and high winds. Secondary highways, such as Route 79 were nearly impassable in some areas. Many Boston-area newscasters credit the New England Patriots football game on January 23 for keeping most travellers indoors, avoiding the pile-ups and endless lines of stuck cars that were the hallmark of the Blizzard of 1978. The fact that the storm fell on a weekend when many people did not have to go to work or school also helped to this effect. ==Aftermath== With much of the snow cleared from the roads by the evening of January 24, snowpiles on street corners were in excess of ten feet high in some locations. Roads were severely narrowed in most congested areas, due to parked cars that were not towed and instead simply plowed in. Most schools in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island remained closed for an extended period of time to allow for clean-up of the road debris. ==Storm totals== Location - storm total - time/date -

Along with the parishes of St Michael and All Angels, Barnes and Holy Trinity Barnes it forms the Barnes Team Ministry; the current Team Rector is Rev'd James Hutchings. ==History== The church was built of coursed flint some time between 1100 and 1150. It was enlarged and re-consecrated in 1215, after the signing of Magna Carta, by Cardinal Stephen Langton (c. 1150–1228), who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1207 to 1228. It was extended to the west in the 13th century, and later to the east, creating a chancel. A west tower was added in the late 15th century. The north wall was demolished in the late 18th century to create a north aisle. The full set of eight bells in the tower was completed in 1897 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. A major fire on 8 June 1978 destroyed parts of the church, but left the tower and Norman chapel almost intact. The church was restored by Edward Cullinan with the inclusion of elements of its former structure. The north wall contains a Gothic Revival east window. The church was re-dedicated in February 1984, with the original building now named as the Langton Chapel, commemorating Archbishop Stephen Langton. ==Notable burials== * Major General Roger Elliott (c. 1665–1714), who lived at Byfeld House in Church Road, Barnes, was buried in the churchyard in May 1714. *John Moody (c. 1727–1812), actor, who lived at 11 The Terrace, Barnes, c.1780 until his death, is buried in the churchyard with his two wives. ==References== ==Further reading== *Official Guidebook to The Parish Church of St. Mary, Barnes ==Gallery== File:St Mary's Church, Barnes 02.JPGExterior view File:Entrance to St Mary's Church, Barnes.jpgChurch entrance File:St Mary's Church, Barnes 14.JPGClock File:20th Century Extension to the Church of Saint Mary, Barnes.jpg20th- century extension File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, interior.jpgInterior view File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, Langton Chapel.jpgLangton Chapel File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, monumental brass to Edith and Elizabeth Wylde, 1508.jpg1508 brass monument to Edith and Elizabeth Wylde in Langton Chapel ==External links== * Category:1100s establishments in England Barnes Barnes Category:Churches in Barnes, London Category:Flint buildings Category:Grade II* listed churches in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:History of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Rebuilt churches in the United Kingdom ","title":"St Mary's Church, Barnes"},{"id":"1423328","text":"Roswell Dwight Hitchcock (August 15, 1817 - June 16, 1887) was a United States Congregationalist clergyman. ==Biography== He was born at East Machias, Maine.

He was a tutor at Amherst in 1839–1842, and was minister of The Congregational Church in Exeter, Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1845–1852. He became professor of natural and revealed religion in Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, in 1852, and in 1855 professor of church history in the Union Theological Seminary in New York, of which he was president in 1880–1887.

Hitchcock...Dr. Hitchcock was a man of wide and genuine learning, but still more remarkable for his mental and spiritual insight. He saw religious truth in clear perspective and in just proportion. As a church historian, he knew and honored the historic Church, but he lived in the full freedom of the spirit. His independence could rise, if there was occasion, into courage. He was broadly and fearlessly progressive. Personally he was capable of sharing the riches of his mind and heart. His friendship had the reality and the charm of intimacy. Though several years my senior he never allowed the intervening years or the wisdom for which these stood, to create the slightest impression of conscious superiority. He was to me a most lovable man, not in spite of his great intellectual gifts, but because of them. I felt whenever I talked with him that I had access to the whole man. It was to me of great significance in the following years that this intimacy of personal friendship was in no sense dependent on frequent contact. The letters which came to me at Andover until his death bore the marks of the same rare and quickening friendship.\\" My Generation: An Autobiographical Interpretation, p. 80. ==Notes== == Sources == * ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary Category:1817 births Category:1887 deaths Category:American theologians Category:Bowdoin College faculty Category:People from East Machias, Maine Category:Amherst College alumni Category:American Congregationalist ministers ","title":"Roswell Dwight Hitchcock"},{"id":"1423332","text":"Cookstown District Council (; Ulster Scots: Districk Cooncil o Cookestoun) was a district council covering an area largely in County Tyrone and partly in County Londonderry.

His father was not only a scientific jurist, but also a lawyer in large practice in Berlin. After working under his father, Hinschius in 1852 began to study jurisprudence at Heidelberg and Berlin, the teacher who had most influence upon him being Aemilius Ludwig Richter (1808–1864), to whom he afterwards ascribed the great utriusque juris, and in 1859 was admitted to the juridical faculty of Berlin. In 1863 he went as professor extraordinarius to Halle, returning in the same capacity to Berlin in 1865. In 1868, Hinschius became professor ordinarius at the University of Kiel, which he represented in the Prussian Upper House (1870–1871). He also assisted his father in editing the Preussische Anwaltszeitung from 1862 to 1866 and the Zeitschrift fur Gesetzgebung and Rechtspflege in Preussen from 1867 to 1871. In 1872, he was appointed professor ordinarius of ecclesiastical law at Berlin. In the same year he took part in the conferences of the ministry of ecclesiastical affairs, which issued in the famous \\"Falk Laws.\\" In connexion with the developments of the Kulturkampf which resulted from the \\"Falk Laws,\\" he wrote several treatises: e.g. on \\"The Attitude of the German State Governments towards the Decrees of the Vatican Council\\" (1871), on \\"The Prussian Church Laws of 1873\\" (1873), \\"The Prussian Church Laws of the years 1874 and 1875\\" (1875), and \\"The Prussian Church Law of 14th July 1880\\" (1881). He sat in the Reichstag as a National Liberal from 1872 to 1878, and again in 1881 and 1882, and from 1889 onwards he represented the University of Berlin in the Prussian Upper House. The two great works by which Hinschius established his fame are the Decretales Pseudo-Isidorianae et capitula Angilrantni (2 parts, Leipzig, 1863) and Das Kirchenrecht der Katholiken and Protestanten in Deutschland, vols. i.-vi. (Berlin, 1869–1877). The first of these, for which during 1860 and 1861 he had gathered materials in Italy, Spain, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, was the first critical edition of the False Decretals. His most monumental work, however, is the Kirchenrecht, which remains incomplete. The six volumes actually published (System des katholischen Kirchenrechts) cover only book i. of the work as planned; they are devoted to an exhaustive historical and analytical study of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its government of the church. The work is planned with special reference to Germany; but in fact its scheme embraces the whole of the Roman Catholic organization in its principles and practice. Unfortunately even this part of the work remains incomplete; two chapters of book i. and the whole of book ii., which was to have dealt with \\"the rights and duties of the members of the hierarchy,\\" remain unwritten; the most notable omission is that of the ecclesiastical law in relation to the regular orders. Incomplete as it is, however, the Kirchenrecht remains a work of the highest scientific authority. Epoch-making in its application of the modern historical method to the study of ecclesiastical law in its theory and practice, it has become the model for the younger school of canonists.

Diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia in the 1950s, he spent most of his adult life in and out of psychiatric hospitals.Poetic Australians. Carol Treloar. The Advertiser. 7 September 1991. His output was prolific and his work has often been published in anthologies. ==Early life== Francis Webb was born in Adelaide. His father was a musician, Director of the North Sydney Academy of Music before moving to Adelaide where he became the owner of a piano importing business in Grenfell Street. His mother was a socialite with a keen interest in horse racing. She died when he was two years old, and his father was hospitalised a year later. In 1928, Webb and his three sisters (Mavis, Claudia, and Leonie) were sent to live with their paternal grandparents, Charles and Amy Webb-Wagg, in Sydney. Webb wrote his first poems as a birthday present for his paternal grandmother when he was seven years old, under the tutelage of an aunt who died before she could see them in print. When Webb was 14 years old his much loved grandfather died. Webb's first major individual publication came with the appearance of 'Palace of Dreams' in The Bulletin (10 June 1942). Having finished high school, Webb considered entry into Sydney University on a scholarship, but this plan was disrupted by the Second World War. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force between 1943 and 1945 and spent time during the war based in Canada. His father died at Sydney's Callan Park Hospital a few weeks after his demobilisation. ==Career== Webb enrolled at Sydney University in early 1946 but discontinued studies by mid-1946. His desire to write and travel saw his return to Canada in 1947, where he worked for the publisher Macmillan. In 1948, Angus & Robertson published his first collection of poems, A Drum for Ben Boyd, with illustrations by Norman Lindsay. In 1949, after a period of employment, and the termination of his engagement to a Jewish girl named Ethel (whom he had met in Canada during the war), he set off for Britain. During this time, Webb's correspondence with Norman Lindsay faltered and he rejected illustrations proposed by Lindsay for his second collection, Leichhardt in Theatre, which was eventually published by Angus & Robertson in 1952 (minus illustrations). Webb's break from Lindsay marked his rejection of Lindsay's renowned anti-Semitism. Angus & Robertson did not publish his work again until he had regained the full support of Douglas Stewart (editor of The Bulletin and Lindsay's friend) a few years later. Soon after Webb's 1949 arrival in England, he was confined to a mental asylum following a suicide attempt. His younger sister Leonie flew to England and retrieved her brother in 1950, stopping off at Rome on the trip home. Once back in Australia, he endured a period of itinerancy combined with ecstatic episodes of writing in Galston, New South Wales; Melbourne; Semaphore, South Australia; and Jamestown, South Australia until 1953. The creative product of these years, including his famous poems 'Birthday' (about Adolf Hitler's last hours) and 'The Canticle' (a poem about the life of Francis of Assisi), was self-published in his third collection simply entitled Birthday (1953). In late 1953 Webb returned to England. On his trip to England he made a stopover in India, the inspiration for such poems as 'Song of Hunger' and 'Back Street in Calcutta'. But once in England he was confined at a number of asylums over a period of seven years. During this time he wrote many of the poems, including 'Eyre All Alone', which would comprise his fourth collection Socrates and other poems, eventually published in 1961. Following a Commonwealth Literary Fund Fellowship, in 1958, and with the support of Douglas Stewart and other concerned Australian poets such as Rosemary Dobson, David Campbell and Vincent Buckley), his supervised release from David Rice Hospital (Norwich) was organised. His passport was returned to him and he came home to Australia in late 1960. His paternal grandmother died shortly after his return. Webb spent the rest of his life in and out of New South Wales and Victorian psychiatric facilities. In 1964, Angus & Robertson published his fifth collection The Ghost of the Cock, then in 1969 released his well-known Collected Poems, with an unforgettable foreword by Sir Herbert Read (the eminent leading British critic in his day) that compared Webb's work on equal footing with that of major European and American poets Pasternak, Lowell, Rilke and Eliot. After the publication of The Ghost of the Cock in 1964, Webb wrote eight substantial poems (two of which appear in Collected Poems while the rest can be found in the recent selection of his work in the online Australian literary journal Thylazine). In 1967, Webb was praised by Read as \\"one of the greatest poets of our time . . . one of the most unjustly neglected poets of the century,\\" and Webb has since attracted substantial critical acclaim for his profound vision, his unique spiritual quest to discover the heart of things. Webb died on 23 November 1973 in Sydney's Rydalmere Psychiatric Hospital of a coronary occlusion. He is buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery in northern Sydney, with 'Sunset Hails a Rising' from his poem 'The Stations' upon his headstone.

Jean-Charles della Faille (Dutch: Jan-Karel della Faille, Spanish: Juan Carlos della Faille), born in Antwerp, 1 March 1597 and died in Barcelona, 4 November 1652, was a Flemish Jesuit priest from Brabant, and a mathematician of repute. Theoremata de centro gravitatis partium circulis et ellipsis, 1632 He was born in Antwerp, part of the Spanish Empire at that time. He was educated at the Jesuit school founded by François d'Aguilon, and joined the Jesuit order in 1613. He then went to a Jesuit college in Mechelen for two years. Afterwards, he came back to Antwerp where, as one of the best Mathematics' students of Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, he became also his disciple. In 1620, he went to Dole, also part of the Spanish Empire, to teach mathematics and learn theology in view of being ordained to the priesthood. The ordination took place 10 April 1621. From 1626 to 1628, he taught mathematics at the Jesuit scholasticate of Louvain, before being appointed to the Imperial College in Madrid. He there advised Philip IV, king of Spain, on military questions, specially fortifications, and taught mathematics as well. His most famous book is Theoremata de centro gravitatis partium circuli et ellipsis (1632) in which he determined the centre of gravity of the sector of a circle, for the first time. At the request of della Faille's family, the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck painted a portrait of the mathematician in 1629. The portrait shows the mathematician in his Jesuit outfit with a set of tools (including a compass,The compass in the painting is the model of compass developed earlier by another mathematician established in Antwerpen, Michiel Coignet. Several of these compasses are on display in the \\"Ciencias Nauticas\\" Room of the Madrid Naval Museum. a t-square and a globe).

Nong Khai has become a popular destination during the Buddhist Lent festival when mysterious balls of light, or Naga fireballs, rise from the Mekong River. The balls resemble an orange sun. They rise out of the river approximately 6–9 meters (20 to 30 feet) and disappear after three to five seconds. Although the fireballs can be seen at other times, most Thais travel to see them during the full moon in October when the incidence of them is considered to be much higher. Nong Khai's main sight is Sala Keoku (alternatively spelled as Sala Kaew Ku, also known as Wat Khaek), a park of colossal sculptures, some over 20 m tall. The park is the handiwork of the mystic Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who bought the land in 1978 when he was exiled from his native Laos, where he had built a similar park in Vientiane in the 1950s. Synthesizing Buddhist and Hinduist ideologies, Buddhas, many-armed goddesses, a seven-headed Naga snake, and various human-animal hybrids dominate the site. ==Climate== == References == ==External links== * Category:Populated places in Nong Khai Province Category:Laos–Thailand border crossings Category:Populated places on the Mekong River Category:Cities and towns in Thailand Category:Isan ","title":"Nong Khai"},{"id":"1423372","text":"Marcos Prado Troyjo in 2017.

He contributed to contemporary periodicals and engaged in literary battles with poets, playwrights and scientists. He is remembered for his illustrated botanical compendium The Vegetable System, one of the first works to use the nomenclature of Carl Linnaeus. In recognition of his efforts, he was created a knight of the Order of Vasa in 1774 by Gustav III of Sweden and thereafter called himself Sir John Hill.\\"The Vegetable System : plates, volume I 1759\\". Royal Collection Trust. Retrieved 2 August 2020. == Biography == He was the son of the Rev. Theophilus Hill and is said to have been born in Peterborough. He was apprenticed to an apothecary and on the completion of his apprenticeship he set up in a small shop in St Martin's Lane, Westminster. He also travelled over the country in search of rare herbs, with a view to publishing a hortus siccus, but the plan failed. He obtained the degree of M.D. from the University of St. Andrews at a time when its fortunes were at a low ebb, and practised as a quack doctor, making considerable sums by the preparation of dubious herb and vegetable medicines. He was known for his \\"pectoral balsam of honey\\" and \\"tincture of bardana\\".Anonymous. (1892). \\"A Forgotten Quack\\". Chemist and Druggist: The Newsweekly for Pharmacy 40: 151. == Work == His first publication was a translation of Theophrastus's History of Stones (1746). From this time forward he was an indefatigable writer. He edited The British Magazine (1746–1750), and for two years (1751–1753) he wrote a daily letter, \\"The Inspector,\\" for the London Advertiser and Literary Gazette. He also produced novels, plays and scientific works; and was a major contributor to the supplement of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia. From 1759 to 1775 he was engaged on a huge botanical work, The Vegetable System (26 folio volumes), illustrated by 1,600 copper-plate engravings and published (plain) at thirty-eight guineas, and (coloured) at one hundred and sixty guineas. Hill's botanical labours were undertaken at the request of his patron, Lord Bute, and he was rewarded by the Order of Vasa from the King of Sweden in 1774. Of the seventy-six separate works with which he is credited in the Dictionary of National Biography, the most valuable are those that deal with botany. He is reputed to have been the author of the second part of The Oeconomy of Human Life (1751), the first part of which is by Lord Chesterfield, and Hannah Glasse's famous manual of cookery was generally ascribed to him (see Boswell, ed. Hill, iii. 285). Samuel Johnson said of him that he was \\"an ingenious man, but had no veracity.\\" See a Short Account of the Life, Writings and Character of the late Sir John Hill (1779), which is chiefly occupied with a descriptive catalogue of his works; also Temple Bar (1872, xxxv. 261–266). John Hill's often provocative and scurrilous writings involved him in many quarrels, both in the field of science and that of literature. === Quarrel with the Royal Society, 1750–1751 === During the 1740s, and especially in 1746–1747, Hill attended many meetings of the Royal Society, and there presented the results of several of his studies, both in the field of botany (on the propagation of moss), medicine (a surgical operation to remove a needle from the abdominal wall of a man), and geology- chemistry (on the origin of the sapphire's colour, on chrysocolla, on an alternative to Windsor loam for the making of fire-resistant bricks). His works On the manner of seeding mosses and On Windsor loam appeared in the Royal Society's journal, the Philosophical Transactions. On the basis of these contributions, Hill apparently hoped to be elected Fellow of the Royal Society. Furthermore, he had the backing of several members of the Royal Society: the botanist Peter Collinson, the physician and scientist William Watson, and the antiquarian William Stukeley. Moreover, Hill had links with important nobles: John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, also Fellows of the Royal Society; and Sir Thomas Robinson, Governor of Barbados and antiquarian. Despite Hill's merits as a scientist (at a time when many Fellows had no scientific background) and his relations, his election to the title of Fellow failed to materialise. Disappointed by the Royal Society's lack, in his opinion, of scientific standards, Hill started to criticise the Society. In December 1749, he started writing anonymous, critical reviews of some articles published in the Philosophical Transactions. Moreover, in January 1750, Hill began a campaign of criticism and derision against the Royal Society and its president, Martin Folkes, by publishing, under an alias, a treatise entitled Lucina sine concubitu. A letter humbly address'd to the Royal Society; In which is proved, by most Incontestable Evidence, drawn from Reason and Practice, that a Woman may conceive and be brought to bed, without any commerce with Man. Under the false name of Abraham Johnson, a physician and man-midwife, Hill claimed to have observed cases where women had become pregnant without having had any kind of sexual relations with a man. === The \\"paper war\\" of 1752–1753 === Henry Fielding attacked him in The Covent Garden Journal, Christopher Smart wrote a mock- epic, The Hilliad, against him, and David Garrick replied to his strictures against him by two epigrams, one of which runs: \\"For physics and farces, his equal there scarce is; His farces are physic, his physic a farce is.\\" He had other literary passages-at-arms with John Rich, who accused him of plagiarising his Orpheus, also with Samuel Foote and Henry Woodward. == Recent biography and scholarship == In 2012 George Rousseau published a full-length biography of Hill entitled The Notorious Sir John Hill: The Man Destroyed by Ambition in the Era of Celebrity.George Rousseau. The Notorious John Hill: the man destroyed by ambition in the era of celebrity. Lehigh University Press, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 2012.

Rousseau’s biography also demonstrates Hill’s polymathic endeavors as apothecary, botanist, conchologist, doctor, entrepreneur, geologist, herbalist, journalist, novelist, satirist, and all- around Wit and ‘Man about Town’ in an era when ‘Wits’ ruled the civilized world and when metropolitan culture was beginning to assume the power it has wielded over the last two centuries. Reviews of The Notorious Sir John Hill have so far applauded Rousseau’s aim to demonstrate that Hill was driven by the ambition to possess a ‘celebrated life’ and become a ‘celebrated figure’ during a generation when celebrity culture was on the ascendancy. \\\\---- \\\\---- == Selected publications == * Hill, John (1750), Lucine sine concubitu: a letter addressed to the Royal Society. * Hill, John (1750), A Dissertation on Royal Societies. * Hill, John (1751), Review of the Works of the Royal Society of London. * Hill, John [attributed] (1751), The Oeconomy of Human Life 2. * Hill, John (1751), A History of the Materia Medica * Hill, John (1751–1753), \\"The Inspector\\" [daily column], London Advertiser and Literary Gazette: Much of Hill's part in the Paper War of 1752–1753 was carried out in this column. * Hill, John (1752), The Impertinent * Hill, John (1752), Letters from the Inspector to a Lady with the genuine Answers. * Hill, John in: Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, Supplement. 1753 various articles * Hill, John (1754), Urania: Or, a Complete View of the Heavens; Containing the Ancient and Modern Astronomy, in Form of a Dictionary: Illustrated with a Great Number of Figures ...

Examples include production of radio frequency (RF) amplifiers, LEDs, optical computer components, and CPUs for computers. Wafer fabrication is used to build components with the necessary electrical structures. The main process begins with electrical engineers designing the circuit and defining its functions, and specifying the signals, inputs, outputs and voltages needed. These electrical circuit specifications are entered into electrical circuit design software, such as SPICE, and then imported into circuit layout programs, which are similar to ones used for computer aided design. This is necessary for the layers to be defined for photomask production. The resolution of the circuits increases rapidly with each step in design, as the scale of the circuits at the start of the design process is already being measured in fractions of micrometers. Each step thus increases circuit density for a given area. The silicon wafers start out blank and pure. The circuits are built in layers in clean rooms. First, photoresist patterns are photo- masked in micrometer detail onto the wafers' surface. The wafers are then exposed to short-wave ultraviolet light and the unexposed areas are thus etched away and cleaned. Hot chemical vapors are deposited on to the desired zones and baked in high heat, which permeate the vapors into the desired zones. In some cases, ions, such as O2+ or O+, are implanted in precise patterns and at a specific depth by using RF-driven ion sources. These steps are often repeated many hundreds of times, depending on the complexity of the desired circuit and its connections. New processes to accomplish each of these steps with better resolution and in improved ways emerge every year, with the result of constantly changing technology in the wafer fabrication industry. New technologies result in denser packing of minuscule surface features such as transistors and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). This increased density continues the trend often cited as Moore's Law. A fab is a common term for where these processes are accomplished. Often the fab is owned by the company that sells the chips, such as AMD, Intel, Texas Instruments, or Freescale. A foundry is a fab at which semiconductor chips or wafers are fabricated to order for third party companies that sell the chip, such as fabs owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), GlobalFoundries and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). In 2013 the cost of building the next generation wafer fab was over $10 billion.Should an Indian fab use older process?

It was founded by drum shop owner and drummer Jim Marshall, and is now based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Marshall's guitar amplifiers are among the most recognised in the world. Their signature sound, characterized by sizzling distortion and \\"crunch,\\" was conceived by Marshall after guitarists, such as Pete Townshend, visited Marshall's drum shop complaining that the guitar amplifiers then on the market didn't have the right sound or enough volume.Jim Marshall, creator of the Marshall amp, dies aged 88.

Retrieved 6 April 2012 Many of the current and reissue Marshall guitar amplifiers continue to use vacuum tubes (also called valves in Britain and some other regions), as is common in this market sector. Marshall also manufactures less expensive solid-state, hybrid (vacuum tube and solid state) and modelling amplifiers. ==History== === Origins === Site of Jim Marshall's first shop, now a men's barber After a successful career as a drummer and teacher of drum technique, Jim Marshall first went into business in 1962 with a small shop in Hanwell, London, selling drums, cymbals and drum- related accessories; Marshall himself also gave drum lessons. According to Jim, Ritchie Blackmore, Big Jim Sullivan and Pete Townshend were the three main guitarists who often came into the shop and pushed Marshall to make guitar amplifiers and told him the sound and design they wanted. Marshall Ltd. then expanded, hired designers and started making guitar amplifiers to compete with existing amplifiers, the most notable of which at the time were the Fender amplifiers imported from America. These were very popular with guitarists and bass players, but were very expensive. The three guitarists were among the first customers of the first 23 Marshall amplifiers made. ===First amplifiers: birth of the JTM 45=== Jim Marshall wanted someone to produce a cheaper alternative to American-made guitar amplifiers, but as he had limited electrical-engineering experience he enlisted the help of his shop repairman, Ken Bran, a Pan American Airways technician, Dudley Craven, an EMI apprentice They most liked the sound of the 4×10-inch Fender Bassman and made several prototypes using the Fender Bassman amplifier as a model. The sixth prototype produced, in Jim's words, the \\"Marshall Sound\\", although at this time the only involvement Jim had was to sell the amps on a commission basis in his shop. As business increased, Marshall asked the three to work for him in his shop, as he had more space and capital to expand. The original idea was talked about late one Friday night in early 1963 in a Wimpy bar in Ealing in West London by three amateur radio enthusiasts after they had been to their weekly Greenford radio club meeting, Dudley's call sign was G3PUN, Ken Bran's was G3UDC, and Ken Underwood's was G3SDW. As of Dudley's death in 1998 and Ken Bran's death in 2018, the only original individual is Ken Underwood. The first six production units were assembled in the garden sheds of Ken Bran, Dudley Craven, and Ken Underwood in the same year, in Heston, Hanwell and Hayes, all in West London. They were almost copies of the Bassman circuit, with American military-surplus 5881 power valves, a relative of the 6L6. Few speakers then were able to handle more than 15 watts, which meant that an amplifier approaching 50 watts had to use four speakers. For their Bassman, Fender used four Jensen speakers in the same cabinet as the amplifier, but Marshall chose to separate the amplifier from the speakers, and placed four 12-inch Celestion speakers in a separate closed-back cabinet instead of the four 10-inch Jensens in an open-back combo. Other crucial differences included the use of higher- gain ECC83 valves throughout the preamp, and the introduction of a capacitor/resistor filter after the volume control. These circuit changes gave the amp more gain so that it broke into overdrive sooner on the volume control than the Bassman, and boosted the treble frequencies. This new amplifier, tentatively called the \\"Mark II\\", was eventually named the \\"JTM 45\\", after Jim and his son Terry Marshall and the maximum wattage of the amplifier. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and other blues rock-based bands from the late 1960s such as Free used Marshall stacks both in the studio and live on stage making them among the most sought after and most popular amplifiers in the industry. ===Distribution deal=== Marshall entered into a 15-year distribution deal with British company Rose-Morris during 1965, which gave him the capital to expand his manufacturing operations, though it would prove to be costly. In retrospect, Marshall admitted the Rose-Morris deal was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made. Rose-Morris hadn't a clue, really. For export, they added 55% onto my price, which pretty much priced us out of the world market for a long time.\\"History of Marshall from Guitar World Magazine, September 2002, page 84 ===Park amplification=== The new contract had disenfranchised several of Marshall's former distributors, among them his old friend Johnny Jones. Marshall's contract did not prevent him from building amplifiers outside the company, and so Marshall launched the Park brand name, inspired by the maiden name of Jones's wife. To comply with his contract stipulations, these amplifiers had minor circuit changes compared to the regular Marshalls, and minor changes to the appearance. For instance, often the Parks had silver or black front panels instead of the Marshall's gold ones, some of the enclosures were taller or shaped differently, and controls were laid out and labelled differently. Starting in early 1965, Park produced a number of amplifiers including a 45-watt head. Most of these had Marshall layout and components, though some unusual amplifiers were made, such as a 75 watt keyboard amplifier with KT88 tubes. A 2×12-inch combo had the option of sending the first channel into the second, probably inspired by Marshall users doing the same trick with a jumper cable. The 1972 Park 75 put out about 100 watts by way of two KT88s, whereas the comparable 50-watt Model 1987 of that time used 2 EL34 tubes. In 1982, Park came to an end, though Marshall later revived the brand for some transistor amplifiers made in Asia. The Parks made from the mid-1960s to around 1974 (the \\"golden years\\"), with point-to-point wiring – rumoured to be \\"a little hotter\\" than regular Marshalls – fetch higher prices than comparable \\"real\\" Marshalls from the same period. ===Other Marshall brand names=== Wall of Marshall Fridge: refrigerator products using Marshall brand. Other brand names Marshall Amplification had used for various business reasons included Big M (for the then-West German market), Kitchen/Marshall (for the Kitchen Music retail chain in North London), Narb (Ken Bran's surname spelled backwards) and CMI (Cleartone Musical Instruments). Amplifiers sold under these brand names are quite rare, and sell to collectors at high prices.History of Marshall from Guitar World Magazine, September 2002, page 86 == Early amp models == === The Bluesbreaker === To reduce costs Marshall started sourcing parts from the UK. This led to the use of Dagnall and Drake- made transformers, and a switch to the KT66 valve instead of the 6L6 tube commonly used in the United States. The changes gave Marshall amplifiers a more aggressive voice, which quickly found favour with players such as Eric Clapton, who would sit in Jim's shop practising. Clapton asked Jim Marshall to produce a combo amp with tremolo, which would fit in the boot of his car, and one of the most famous Marshall amps was born, the \\"Bluesbreaker\\" amp. This is the amplifier, in tandem with his 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard (the \\"Beano\\"), that gave Clapton that famous tone on the John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers' 1966 album, Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton. === The Plexi and the Marshall stack === Other early customers included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose search for extra volume led Marshall to design the classic 100-watt valve amplifier. Ken Bran and Dudley Craven, Marshall's developers, doubled the number of output valves, added a larger power transformer and an extra output transformer. Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Pete Townshend, and the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original Plexi, was born in 1965. At the request of Pete Townshend, Marshall produced an 8×12-inch cabinet (soon replaced by a pair of 4×12-inch cabinets) on top of which the 1959 amplifier head was placed, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock and roll. The size of the wall of Marshall stacks \\"soon became an indicator of the band's status\\", even when rendered obsolete by improved PA systems; indeed, many of the \\"ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabs\\" included dummies. Still, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, even though they often contain many more features (or different tubes, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 tubes). === Another valve change === Rare 1971 200-watt Marshall Major At this time, the KT66 valve was becoming more expensive, as the M-OV Company faced greater competition from Mullard. Hence, another valve change was made, with Marshall starting to use European-made Mullard EL34 power stage valves. These have a different overdrive character than the KT66s, which gave Marshalls a more aggressive voice still. In 1966 Jimi Hendrix was in Jim's shop, trying the amplifiers and guitars. Jim Marshall expected Hendrix to be \\"another American wanting something for nothing\\" but to his surprise, Hendrix offered to buy the amplifiers at retail price if Jim would provide him with support for them around the world. Jim Marshall agreed, and several of Hendrix's road crew were trained in the repair and maintenance of the Marshall amps through the years. The amplifiers from this era are easily identifiable by their acrylic glass (a.k.a. Plexiglas) front panel, which earned them the nickname \\"Plexi\\". In 1967, Marshall released a 50-watt version of the 100-watt Superlead known as the 1987 Model. In 1969, the plexiglass panel was replaced by a brushed metal front panel. == Mid-1970s and 1980s models == === The JMPs === After 1973, to streamline production, labour-intensive handwiring was discontinued and Marshall valve amplifiers were switched to printed-circuit-board (PCBs). Much of the debate about the difference in tone between the plexi- and aluminium- panel Marshall amps originates from 1974 when a number of circuit changes were made to the 1959 and 1987 amplifiers; with the addition of 'mkII' added to the 'Super Lead' name on the back panel and 'JMP' (\\"Jim Marshall Products\\") added to the left of the power switch on the front panel. Marshall's US distributor Unicord also had them change all the amps sold in the US and Japan to the much more rugged General Electric 6550 instead of the EL34 output tube. The combined effect of different tubes and a modified circuit gave these mid-1970s Marshalls a very bright and aggressive sound that was punchier than the EL34 sound, but not as rich, compressed, and had less poweramp distortion. In late 1975, Marshall introduced the \\"Master Volume\\" (\\"MV\\") series with the 100W 2203, followed in 1976 by the 50W 2204. This was an attempt to control the volume level of the amplifiers whilst maintaining the overdriven distortion tones that had become synonymous with the Marshall brand. To do this, Marshall designers connected the two input stages in series rather than parallel on the 2203, but not initially on the 2204, and modified the gain stage circuitry to preserve the tonal characteristics of the 'cranked Plexi' sound and converted the now obsolete second channel volume control to a Master Volume by wiring it between the preamp and EQ circuit. The 2204 followed suit in early 1977 and changed its preamp circuit to match the (then) more popular 2203. Per Rick Reinckens, who was a short-term Unicord employee electronic technician who tested the first units when they arrived from England, Tony Frank, Unicord's chief design engineer, came up with this idea for a dual-volume-control (a preamp gain and a master volume). The circuitry modifications were optimised to replicate the sound of the earlier non-MV Marshall's with the Master Volume control set 'low', however players quickly realised that 'cranking' the MV of these new Marshall amps would yield even more overdrive distortion, the tone of which was more cutting and edgy, and later found favour with players such as Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde and Slash. The 1959 and 1987 non-master volume models also continued under the JMP line until 1982. === JCM 800 === Soon after the Rose-Morris deal had ended in late 1980, Marshall repackaged two MV models, the 2203 and the 2204 (at 100 and 50 watts, respectively), along with the 1959 and 1987 non-master volume Super Lead in a new box with a new panel, and called it the \\"JCM800\\" series (named after his initials and the registration plate of his car). Marshall made several amplifiers under the JCM800 name. === The Jubilee === A landmark year for Jim Marshall was 1987. It marked 25 years in the amplifier business and 50 years in music. This was celebrated with the release of the Silver Jubilee series of amps. The Silver Jubilee series consisted of the 2555 (100 watt head), 2550 (50 watt head) along with other 255x model numbers denominating various combos and even a \\"short head\\". The Jubilee amps were heavily based on the JCM800s of the time, featuring a very similar output section along with a new preamp. Their most publicised feature was the half-power switching, which is activated by a third rocker switch next to the standard \\"power\\" and \\"standby\\" switches. On the 50-watt model this was reflected in the numbering – 2550 is switchable from 25 to 50 watts – and also reflected Marshall amps' 25th anniversary and Jim Marshall's 50 years in music. The amps were trimmed in silver covering, and had a bright silver-coloured faceplate, along with a commemorative plaque. The Jubilee also featured a \\"semi-split channel\\" design, in which two different input gain levels could be set, running through the same tone stack and master volume control. This allowed for a \\"classic Marshall\\" level of gain to be footswitched up to a modern, medium to high gain sound, slightly darker and higher in gain than the brasher JCM800 sound that typified 1980s rock music. \\"The sound of these amps is particularly thick and dark, even on the Marshall scale of things. The gain by today's standards is medium.\\" The distortion sound of the Jubilee range is typified by Slash's live work with Guns N' Roses. He rarely used anything else live, but oddly the Jubilee did not appear on any Guns N' Roses studio albums – instead these feature a modded 1977 JMP mkII (non-MV) on Appetite for Destruction (1987) and a modded JCM800 on the subsequent albums. It can be heard on some of the Velvet Revolver material though. The Jubilee amps also featured a \\"pull out\\" knob that activated a diode clipping circuit (similar to boosting the amp's input with an overdrive pedal). Other notable Jubilee users include the Black Crowes, John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Alex Lifeson (Rush), who used it extensively in the recording of Rush's Clockwork Angels (2012) album. After the Jubilee year, production of the 25xx series amplifiers continued for one more year (with no internal changes), but reverted to a standard Marshall livery of black and gold. These are sometimes referred to as the JCM800 Custom amplifiers. == Mid-1980s and 1990s models == === Competition from American amplifier companies === Marshall began to see more competition from American amplifier companies such as Mesa Boogie and Soldano. Marshall then updated the JCM800 range with additional models and new features such as \\"channel switching\\", which meant that players could switch between clean and distorted tones with the push of a foot-operated switch. This feature debuted in the 2205 (50 watt) and 2210 (100 watt) series and these amps contained more pre-amp gain than ever thanks to a new innovation; diode clipping. This meant a solid-state diode added additional distortion to the signal path, akin to adding a distortion pedal. As such the split channel JCM800s were the highest gain Marshalls yet built – \\"When they were first released, many players were shocked (some were even put off) by its bright, intense distortion – far more than any other amp of the day.\\" While hotly criticised today among valve purists, these amps were more popular than ever, finding mass acceptance within the hard rock community and still in use today by many. The split- channel JCM800s are still used by Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and were played exclusively by Michael Schenker (UFO) for many years. Marshall around this time began further experiments with solid-state amplifiers, which were increasingly improving in quality due to technological innovations but were still considered beginner level equipment. Regardless, solid-state product lines with the Marshall name on them were and still are a wild (if critically discounted) success for the company, allowing entry level guitarists to play the same brand of amp as their heroes. One particularly successful entry-level solid-state Marshall was the Lead 12/Reverb 12 combo series, which featured a preamp section very similar to a JCM800, and a particularly sweet-sounding output section. These amps were actually used on record by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, and are now in some demand. === The 1990s === Magnapop guitarist Ruthie Morris playing a Marshall amp in 1994 ==== JCM 900 ==== In the 1990s, Marshall updated its product line again with the JCM900 series. Reviewed by Guitarist magazine in the UK and given the line, \\"Shredders, here is an amp you won't need to have modified\\", this move by Marshall was again an outgrowth of musicians' desires, featuring more distortion than ever and retaining popular aspects of the late JCM800 models. However, despite such marketing claims they were not as hi-gain as advertised, and used solid state components for much of the distortion in some models - something which many guitarists did not like. Still, if not with shredders, the JCM900 line was well received by younger players associated with pop, rock, punk and grunge which was widespread by the early 1990s. There are three different variants of the JCM900. The most common models are the 4100 (100 watt) and 4500 (50 watt) \\"Dual Reverb\\" models, which are a descendant of the JCM800 2210/2205 design. These models feature two channels, a largely solid state preamp, and diode distortion. The 2100/2500 Mark IIIs are essentially JCM800 2203/2204s with added diode clipping controllable via a knob on the front panel and an effects loop. These are fairly uncommon and were not in production for long before being replaced by the 2100/2500 SL-X, which replaced the diode clipping from the Mk III with another 12AX7/ECC83 preamp tube. These are easily the highest distortion of the three variants. A number of these were shipped with Sovtek 5881 valves, a ruggedized variant of the 6L6 family of output valves, due to a lack of suitable quality EL34s. Most of the JCM900s and 6100s built between 1994–1998 left the factory with the 5881s. Around this time, Marshall released a few \\"special edition\\" amps in this range, including a \\"Slash Signature\\" model, a first for the company. This was actually a re-release of the earlier Silver Jubilee 2555 amplifier, with identical internals, a standard Marshall look, and a Slash logo. This amp retained EL34s and 3,000 units were produced from 1996 to 1997. ==== 30th Anniversary 6100 series ==== 1993 marked 30 years in the amplifier business. To commemorate this milestone, Marshall released the 30th Anniversary series of amplifiers, the EL34 powered 6100LE with commemorative blue covering and gold faceplate, which was followed by the 6100 (in blue tolex and still EL34 powered) and then in 1994 the 6100LM (in standard Marshall livery but now 5881 powered like the JCM900s of the time). All versions of the 6100 had three channels; clean, crunch and lead. The clean channel featured a mid shift, which gave the option of a more \\"Fender-like\\" voicing, and the crunch channel featured three modes recreating all the classic Marshall crunch tones of the past three decades. The lead channel featured a switchable gain boost and a mid-range contour switch, which gave it the tone and gain levels, which Marshall's engineers hoped would keep it competitive in the high-gain world in the early to mid-1990s. In fact some players felt the lead channel was perhaps the weaker link in the amplifier's arsenal, and it came in for revisions in the third year of production (the LM standing for \\"Lead Mod\\"). This revision featured even higher gain. The Anniversary series found prominence with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured the early EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live along with his signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal which is based on his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other than perhaps the later JVM), with MIDI channel selection, half power switching, pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. Despite all this complication the amps had a pure signal path that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock. ==Current models== Marshall currently produces a number of amplifiers, which are a mix of modern designs and vintage reissues. Most models attempt to include the \\"classic\\" Marshall \\"roar\\". ===Modern series=== , Marshall produced a wide range of amps with the look and sound of the Marshall valve amp. The longest running of such models is the JCM2000 range, which is split into the two- and three-channel series, known as the Dual and Triple Super Leads. These amps are a continuation of the JCM800 and 900 series, although the controversial diode clipping circuit used in the later 800 and 900 amps has been removed in favour of additional valve gain stages. Although lumped together as JCM2000 models the DSL and the TSL have different circuits and are more distantly related than the model range suggests. The DSL is an extension of the JCM800 series with several changes including dual reverb controls and is generally considered to be an excellent workhorse although it lacks the direct foot switching of all 4 possible channel options – clean/crunch/OD1 and OD2 – instead it only offers 2-channel switching and both channels share the same tone knobs. Marshall looked towards a new flagship to nail all the compromising of the earlier models, the JVM, made in a variety of models and ranges. These amps have up to four channels, each with three-foot-switchable modes, dual master volumes, reverb controls for each channel, and a foot-switchable effects loop. These features can be programmed into the standard foot-switch to be foot-switchable as \\"patches\\", so now the user can switch from, say, a clean channel with a chorus in the effects loop and reverb, to a medium-gain rhythm sound with no effects, to a high-gain lead sound with boosted output volume, with one click of the foot- switch per sound. The JVM range consists of the JVM410H, a 100-watt four- channel head. The JVM410C, a 100-watt four-channel 2x12\\" combo. The JVM210H and JVM210C, 100-watt two-channel head and 2x12\\" combo respectively and 50-watt versions of these, JVM205H (head), JVM205C (2x12\\" combo) and JVM215 (1x12\\" combo). Joe Satriani uses a signature JVM amp called the JVM410HJS which features noise gates in place of reverb on the front panel. Around the same time as the release of the JVM, Marshall also released an amp called the Vintage Modern, which is designed to be much simpler, with a single channel and designed to be controlled more by the player's style and guitar than by channel switching or multiple settings, reminiscent of the vintage \\"Plexi\\" and JCM800 range, but with modern conveniences such as foot-switchable dynamic ranges (distortion levels), effects loop and reverb. The Vintage Modern series consists of the 2466 100-watt head and 2266 50-watt head with matching combos and a matching cabinet loaded with G12C 25-watt Greenbacks. The Vintage Modern is the first Marshall since the late 1960s to be powered by KT66s, a European version of the 6L6 tube. ===Vintage series=== Marshall Vintage Reissue Amplifiers In 2001, Marshall reissued many of its earlier amplifiers, such as the Model 1959-SLP, which is designed to be a reissue of the late-1960s era \\"Plexi\\" amplifier, but which are in reality reissues of the post-1973 Super Lead models in that they use printed circuit boards internally to reduce manufacturing cost. The original design utilised hand-wired circuits on turret boards, which is now available for a premium in the \\"hand-wired\\" series. Other reissues are similarly PCB designed, even where the originals were hand-wired, except where explicitly noted (i.e., the \\"hand-wired\\" range currently offered). ===Solid-state amplifiers=== Marshall's \\"Valvestate\\" amplifiers contained a hybrid of valve and solid-state technology. Currently named the \\"AVT series\\" (although these are now out of production, being replaced with the \\"AVT tribute\\" for a short time), there are a number of different models, all of which are less expensive than their all-valve counterparts. It is Marshall's current line of \\"hybrid\\" amplifier, featuring a 12AX7 preamp tube employed in the preamp (to \\"warm up\\" the signal) as well as solid-state components, with a solid-state power amp. These are considered and marketed as intermediate-level equipment to bridge the gap between the higher valve range and lower range MG series. In January 2009, Marshall released their latest variant of the MG line of practice amplifiers. Replacing the MG3 line, the MG4 has been designed to offer the guitarist a whole host of features whilst keeping the control of the amplifier simple. ===Bass series=== Marshall currently manufactures a professional, all-valve bass rig called the VBA400. It houses eight 6550 power valves plus three ECC83 and one ECC82 preamp valves. The input accommodates both active and passive bass pick-ups; there is also an XLR DI output for recording complete with Earth (grounding) lift and Pre/Post EQ switches. Recently, Marshall has honoured Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead with their first-ever signature bass amp head, based on his 100 watt super bass unit \\"Murder One\\". There are also solid-state models called MB series ranging from 15 watts to 450 watts and extension cabinets. === CODE series === In 2016, Marshall introduced the CODE series of modelling amplifiers, ranging from the 25-watt Code 25 (single 10-inch speaker), 50-watt (single 12-inch speaker) to the 100-watt Code 100 (available as either a 2×12-inch combo or as a head unit). Developed in conjunction with Softube, the amplifiers contain 14 MST preamps, 4 MST power amps and 8 MST speaker cabinets, along with 24 effects. The amplifiers can be controlled via Bluetooth from iOS and Android devices and can also be used to stream audio from a PC. === Origin series === A series of low-wattage, all tube heads and combos assembled in Vietnam hearkening back to the plexi era of the company. The Origin series was introduced to address a demand for lower volume amps that many guitarists were calling for. To address this, Marshall announced the Origin5, a 5-watt amplifier that can run on either high (5-watt) or low (0.5-watt) with the help of Marshall's Powerstem technology. With the introduction of the Powerstem technology, the Origin amps are able to provide reduced output power while retaining the same tonal characteristics of a full- powered amp. This is accomplished through the new attenuation system, Powerstem, by dynamically reducing the rail voltages throughout the amplifier. The Origin line consists of the Origin5 combo (5-watt, 1 x 8\\" Celestion Eight-15 speaker), Origin20 combo (20-watt, 1 x 10\\" Celestion V Type), Origin20 head, Origin50 combo (50-watt, 1 x 12\\" Celestion G12N-60 Midnight 60 speaker), and Origin50 head.\\"New Release: Marshall Origin Series\\", Cream City Music, 2/15/2018 ===Model number confusion=== Occasionally confusion has arisen due to Marshall's method of naming each amp model, especially during its first few decades, when it was distributed under Rose-Morris. Early Amplifier models were simply named after their catalogue number, so for example the 1962 blues breaker was item one thousand, nine hundred and sixty- two in the Rose-Morris catalogue. Later amplifiers were given range designations as well as model numbers, which often indicated information about the amplifier itself, for example the JCM2000 range of amplifiers had models such as the TSL100 (Triple Super Lead 100 W) and combo amplifiers like the TSL122 (Triple Super Lead with 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) other product ranges use similar descriptive model numbers. Often Speaker cabinets designed to suit a particular range will give a prefix before the speaker description such as JVMC212 (JVM cabinet 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) or a suffix C to denote a combo variant of an amplifier such as the Vintage Modern 2266C (Vintage Modern 2 channel 2× KT66 valves Combo). ===Smart speakers=== In August 2018, Marshall announced two smart speakers which run Amazon Alexa. ==The Marshall Legacy== The classic Marshall Stack consists of one head containing the actual amplifier, on top of two stacked 4×12s, which are loudspeaker cabinets each containing four loudspeakers arranged in a square layout. The top cabinet has the top two loudspeakers angled slightly upwards, giving the Marshall stack a distinctive appearance. When a single cabinet is used, the complete unit is called a half stack. In the early-to-mid-1960s, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who were responsible for the creation and widespread use of stacked Marshall cabinets. Townshend later remarked that Entwistle started using Marshall Stacks to hear himself over Keith Moon's drums and Townshend himself also had to use them just to be heard over Entwistle. In fact, the very first 100-watt Marshall amps were created specifically for Entwistle and Townshend when they were looking to replace some equipment that had been stolen from them. They approached Jim Marshall asking, if it would be possible for him to make their new rigs more powerful than those they had lost, to which they were told that the cabinets would have to double in size. They agreed and six rigs of this prototype were manufactured, of which two each were given to Townshend and Entwistle and one each to Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott of The Small Faces. These new \\"double\\" cabinets (each containing 8 speakers) proved too heavy and awkward to be transported practically, so The Who returned to Marshall asking if they could be cut in half and stacked, and although the double cabinets were left intact, the existing single cabinet models (each containing 4 speakers) were modified for stacking, which has become the norm for years to follow. Entwistle and Townshend both continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until (at a time when most bands still used 50–100 W amps with single cabinets) they were both using twin stacks, with each stack powered by new experimental prototype 200 W amps, each connected to the guitar via a Y-splitter. This, in turn, also had a strong influence on the band's contemporaries at the time, with Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Led Zeppelin following suit. However, due to the cost of transport, The Who could not afford to take their full rigs with them for their earliest overseas tours, thus Cream and Hendrix were the first to be seen to use this setup on a wide scale, particularly in America. Ironically, although The Who pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the \\"classic\\" Marshall sound and setup with their equipment being built and tweaked to their personal specifications, they would only use Marshalls for a couple of years before moving on to using Hiwatt equipment. Cream, and particularly Hendrix, would be widely credited with the invention of Marshall Stacks. The search for volume was taken on its next logical step with the advent of \\"daisy chaining\\" two or more amplifiers together. As most amplifier channels have two inputs, the guitar signal being present on both sockets, the cunning musician hooked the spare input of one channel to an input on another amp. By 1969, Hendrix was daisy-chaining four stacks, incorporating both Marshall and Sound City amplifiers, as recommended to him by Townshend.An interview with Pete Townshend from Guitarist magazine, August 1994 This competition for greater volume and greater extremes was taken even further in the early 1970s by the band Blue Öyster Cult, which used an entire wall of full-stack Marshall amplifiers as their backdrop. (BÖC also referred to Marshalls in the songs \\"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll\\" and \\"The Marshall Plan\\"). Artists such as Slayer and Yngwie Malmsteen also use walls of Marshalls; both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer would often be seen playing in front of a total of 24 cabinets. Malmsteen toured with 30 heads and 28 cabinets, and in 2011 said he would use 60 full stacks on his next tour. Many of those cabinets used by rock bands, however, are dummies, and many artists who do not even use Marshall amplifiers have the dummy stacks on stage. ==Sport sponsorships== Marshall is an important sponsor of sport in the local area. Marshall were one of the earliest shirt sponsors for Milton Keynes Dons,MK Dons to have minute's applause for Jim Marshall MK Dons. Retrieved 20 April 2012 they also sponsored Milton Keynes Athletic Club as well as Milton Keynes Lions basketball club, before the latter relocated to London. ==Marshall Arena== In September 2018, Marshall Amplification announced a naming agreement with Arena MK (at Stadium MK in Milton Keynes) to use the space for music events.Welcome to the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes, Milton Keynes Citizen, 29 September 2018 The opening act is to be the Black Eyed Peas. ==See also== * List of guitar amplifier manufacturers * Up to eleven ==ReferencesPlay it Loud: The Story of the Marshall Amp at bbc.co.uk *Jim Marshall Interview for NAMM Oral History Program (2002) Category:Audio amplifier manufacturers Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Milton Keynes Category:British brands Category:British companies established in 1962 Category:Electronics companies established in 1962 Category:Mobile phone manufacturers Category:JAM Industries Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United Kingdom ","title":"Marshall Amplification"},{"id":"1423393","text":"Cylindricorum et annularium libri, 1651 Title page of his Elementa Geometriae...'

Free-range eggs are eggs produced from birds that may be permitted outdoors. The term \\"free-range\\" may be used differently depending on the country and the relevant laws, and is not regulated in many areas. Eggs from hens that are only indoors might also be labelled cage-free, barn, barn-roaming or aviary, following the animal happiness certification policies, also known as \\"happy chickens\\" or \\"happy eggs\\". This is different from birds that are reared in systems labelled as battery cages or furnished cages. ==Legal definition== Legal standards defining \\"free-range\\" can be different or even non-existent depending on the country. Various watchdog organizations, governmental agencies and industry groups adhere to differing criteria of what constitutes \\"free-range\\" and \\"cage-free\\" status. ===United States=== The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires that egg producers be able to demonstrate that \\"free range\\" egg layers have access to the outdoors, though there is no government oversight as to the quality of the external environment, or the amount of time the hen has access to it. Many producers label their eggs as cage-free in addition to, or instead of, free-range. Recently, US egg labels have expanded to include the term \\"barn-roaming,\\" to more accurately describe the source of those eggs that are laid by hens which can not range freely, but are confined to a barn instead of a more restrictive cage. ====Debate==== Commercial free- range hens outdoors.Cage-free eggs have been a major cause of debate in the US. In 2015 there was an initiative proposed in Massachusetts that would ban the sale of in-state meat or eggs \\"from caged animals raised anywhere in the nation\\". This shift from caged to cage-free is concerning for egg industry groups because they believe that this will cause the price of eggs to increase to the point that consumers can not afford to buy them, thereby causing a decline in the egg industry overall. Animal welfare advocates argue that costs will not change as drastically as industry groups are expecting and that the price of eggs will remain almost the same because the housing of the birds does not make a huge difference to cost. Egg industry groups are making an effort to show or \\"educate lawmakers, voters and consumers about the merits and cost-effectiveness of cage use\\". Local farmers and producers say that the shift will occur if that is what consumers want, they will adapt to having birds in or out of cages. Not only are there debates between the egg industry and animal welfare advocates, but people are also debating whether this issue is one that has to be handled by the federal government or the industry. Commercial free-range hens indoors. ===European Union=== In the EU, cage-free egg production includes barns, free-range, organic (in the UK, systems must be free-range if they are to be labelled as organic) and aviary systems. Non-cage systems may be single or multi-tier (up to four levels), with or without outdoor access. In the UK, free-range systems are the most popular of the non- cage alternatives, accounting for around 44% of all eggs in 2013, whereas barns and organic eggs together accounted for 5%.UK egg production and price statistics In free-range systems, hens are housed to a similar standard as the barn or aviary. The European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC stipulates that from 1 January 2007 (1 January 2012 for newly built or rebuilt systems), non-cage systems must provide the following: * A maximum stocking density of 9 hens/m2 of “usable” space (units in production on or before 3 August 1999 could continue with a stocking density up to 12 hens/m2 until 31 December 2011) * If more than one level is used, a height of at least 45 cm between the levels * One nest for every seven hens (or 1 m2 of nest space for every 120 hens if group nests are used) * Litter (e.g. wood shavings) covering at least one-third of the floor surface, providing at least 250 cm2 of littered area per hen * 15 cm of perching space per hen.Compassion in World Farming report - Alternatives to the barren battery cage In addition to these requirements, free-range systems must also provide the following: * One hectare of outdoor range for every 2,500 hens (equivalent to 4 m2 per hen; at least 2.5 m2 per hen must be available at any one time if rotation of the outdoor range is practiced) * Continuous access during the day to this open-air range, which must be “mainly covered with vegetation” * Several popholes extending along the entire length of the building, providing at least 2 m of opening for every 1,000 hens. Case studies of free-range systems for laying hens across the EU, carried out by Compassion in World Farming, demonstrate how breed choice and preventive management practices can enable farmers to successfully use non beak-trimmed birds. ===Australia=== In 2012, the Australian Egg Corporation Limited, the body for the industry, tried to register a free-range trademark allowing 20,000 hens per hectare on the range. This sparked a major discussion between large producers, small producers, animal welfare groups, and consumer rights groups. The trademark application was withdrawn after the ACCC commented that the \\"proposed standards may mislead consumers about the nature of eggs described as ‘free range’\\" in its Initial Assessment of the application. There is a voluntary code, which covers the basic standards of husbandry for physiological and behavioural needs of poultry, that allows for 1,500 layer hens per hectare. However, the code also states that \\"any higher bird density is acceptable only when regular rotation of birds onto fresh range areas occurs\\". The voluntary code is under review and due to be consulted upon. The Queensland government approved an increase in free-range layer hen stocking densities in July 2013. The maximum number of hens per hectare was increased from 1,500 to 10,000. In March 2016, Australian ministers voted in new national standards for the definition of free-range. The new standards allow for up to 10,000 birds per hectare, with no requirement for the hens to actually go outside. CHOICE, Australia's largest non-profit consumer organisation believes Australia's consumer affairs ministers made the decision to put the interests of large-scale Australian egg producers ahead of the needs of consumers. In April 2017, the Australian Government finalised the law and decided to mandate a maximum of 10,000 hens per hectare in outdoor grazing areas, to which the hens must have \\"regular and meaningful\\" access. Currently, the most popular free range accreditation schemes mandating roaming space at or below the standard set by the EU for its members, are the Free Range Farmers Association (750 hens per hectare), Humane Choice (1,500 hens per hectare) and Australian Certified Organic (2,500 hens per hectare under pasture rotation). In July 2017, Snowdale was fined a record amount of $1.05m (including legal costs) for falsely advertising that its eggs were 'free range'. This was substantially larger than the fines imposed upon Derodi, Holland Farms, Pirovic or Darling Downs Fresh Eggs; set at either $300,000 or $250,000. ==Cost== Based on data in the European Commission's socio-economic report published in 2004,European Commission, 2004. Study on the socio-economic implications of the various systems to keep laying hens. Final Report for The European Commission, submitted by Agra CEAS Consulting Ltd., 2120/CC/December 2004. in Compassion in World Farming report - Alternatives to the barren battery cage (prior to battery cages being banned in the EU) it cost €0.66 to produce 12 battery eggs, €0.82 to produce 12 barn eggs and €0.98 to produce 12 free-range eggs. This means that in 2004, one free-range egg cost 2.6 cents more to produce than a battery egg, and a barn egg cost 1.3 cents more to produce than a battery egg. The Commission's report concludes that, if costs were to increase by 20%, which it says is the type of percentage increase in terms of variable costs that producers are likely to face as a result of switching to free-range, the industry will potentially suffer a loss of producer surplus of €354 million (EU-25). The margins achieved by producers for barn and free-range eggs are appreciably higher than those that were available for battery eggs. The Commission's socio-economic report shows that margins for free-range eggs were around twice as high as those for battery eggs. == Animal welfare == Many animal welfare advocates, including the Humane Society of the United States maintain that cage-free and free-range eggs constitute a considerable improvement for laying hens. This has led to the adoption of a cage-free eggs standard by most major food companies in the United States, although in 2017, it was estimated cage-free eggs represented only 10% of all produced. Pundits and food commentators have described the 2016 shift toward cage-free eggs across the food industry as a \\"bold decision\\" and historic shift. Several investigations, particularly by the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), have raised doubts about to what degree cage-free farms are an improvement for laying hens. An investigation of a cage-free Costco facility in late 2016 purported to find cannibalism from the birds attacking each other, and concluded that neither caged nor cage-free facilities offered laying hens positive lives. ==Misconceptions== Photograph of two hen egg yolks, one from a commercial egg operation and one from a free-range backyard hen. The yolk of the backyard egg is bright orange. Free-range eggs may be broader and have more of an orange colour to their yolks owing to the abundance of greens and insects in the birds' diet. However an orange yolk is no guarantee that an egg was produced by a free-range hen. Feed additives such as marigold petal meal, dried algae and alfalfa meal can be used to colour the yolks.North, M. and Bell, D. Commercial Chicken Production Manual, page 678. Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1990 Contrary to popular belief, in the United States free-range regulations do not necessarily require that hens spend substantial time outdoors, only that the hens \\"have access to the outdoors\\". This access may be for very brief periods and the outside area may be small and sparse. Stocking densities indoors are often high, and many hens may stay inside as dominant hens often prevent the others from having access to the outside yard.UPC report ==Nutritional content== Differences in age, strain and nutrition of the hens make scientific conclusions about the effects of housing systems on the quality of the eggs exceedingly difficult. Consumer perceptions of these alternative systems delivering a better product are then scientifically unjustified in terms of there being any nutritional difference. A 2011 research study carried out in North Carolina compared free-range and conventional caged eggs for fatty acids, cholesterol, vitamins A and E, finding higher fat content in free-range eggs, and no significant difference in cholesterol and vitamin levels. Vitamin D in eggs has been observed to increase up to 4 times in hens that have exposure to sunlight, compared to hens that are kept away from sunlight. Another research suggests that grass fed hens can produce eggs that are rich in (n−3) fatty acids, without adverse oxidative effects. Some other non peer- reviewed studies have found evidence for nutritional benefit of free-range eggs.Jull, Morley A.

Some retailers apply this policy not just to eggs in their shells, but also to eggs used in baked goods and processed products such as ready-made meals, quiches and ice cream. In the UK, The Co-Operative and Marks & Spencer sell only free- range shell eggs and use only free-range eggs in their entire range of baked goods, processed products, and ready-made meals. Waitrose sells only free range shell eggs, and uses only free-range eggs in their processed products and ready-made meals. As of 1 January 2007 (with one minor exception), all Austrian supermarkets no longer sell battery eggs. Many retailers in the Netherlands, including Albert Heijn and Schuitema (subsidiaries of Ahold), Laurus (including Edah, Konmar and Super de Boer), Dirk van den Broek (including Bas van der Heijden and Digros), Aldi and Lidl sell only free-range shell eggs; however the free-range eggs that are sold in Aldi and Lidl do not meet some country's recommendations for the production of free-range eggs. Three Belgian supermarkets: Makro, Colruyt and Lidl, no longer sell battery eggs. The Commission's report states that Sweden's move away from conventional battery cages has been aided by the decision by the four largest retailers (who between them account for 98-99% of the Swedish retail market) to stop stocking conventional battery eggs. U.S. food suppliers Aramark and Unilever have announced they intend to buy only cage-free eggs, but as of 2013 there are not enough available to supply them. In Australia free-range eggs that are sold in Aldi and Lidl do not meet CSIRO's Model Code recommendation of 1,500 hens per hectare. In March 2016, Australian ministers voted in new standards for the definition of free-range. The new standards allow for up to 10,000 birds per hectare, with no requirement for the hens to actually go outside. CHOICE, Australia's largest non-profit consumer organisation believes Australia's consumer affairs ministers made the decision to put the interests of large-scale Australian egg producers ahead of the needs of consumers. A group called PROOF (standing for Pasture Raised On Open Fields) is now in the process of developing an accreditation scheme which will see the term \\"pastured\\" start appearing on cartons. The guidelines for PROOF's pastured eggs allow for a maximum stocking density of 1500 birds per hectare (in line with the CSIRO Model Code) as well as requiring that hens are able to range freely in open fields or paddocks. So far, PROOF has 12 licensed egg farms in Australia, with another eight in the pipeline. ==Rehoming charities== Rescue hens (red) and point-of-lay hens (dark) co-exist in a private orchard. In the UK, charities such as Fresh Start for HensFSFH site and British Hen Welfare TrustBHWT site organise rehoming for ex-factory hens that would otherwise be slaughtered. Private smallholders pay around £4-5 per \\"rescue hen\\", and these birds (which may still be laying daily) then spend a \\"retirement\\" in a true free-range environment. The BHW Trust says that there is no better education than watching an ex-battery hen's confusion and bewilderment turn into wonderment at her new environment. ==See also== *Organic egg production * Free range * Yarding * Pastured poultry * Factory farming * Chickens as pets * The Happy Egg Company ==References== Category:Animal welfare Category:Poultry farming Category:Eggs (food) ","title":"Free-range eggs"},{"id":"1423398","text":"Xinhai Geming or Xin Hai Ge Ming may refer to: *Xinhai Revolution, a revolution in 1911 that overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China *1911 (film), a 2011 Chinese film, its Chinese title reads Xinhai Geming *1911 Revolution (TV series), a 2011 Chinese television series ","title":"Xinhai Geming"},{"id":"1423404","text":"Jakob Bartsch or Jacobus Bartschius (c. 1600 - 26 December 1633) was a German astronomer. ==Biography== Bartsch was born in Lauban (Lubań) in Lusatia.

The game was critically acclaimed and was named the \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" by GameSpot in 1999. In 2001, Appeal developed a sequel, called Outcast II: The Lost Paradise, which was never finished due to bankruptcy. In 2010, the game was re-released via digital distribution on GOG. In 2014, Outcast was remastered as Outcast 1.1, after the original developers reacquired the franchise IP. In 2017, a remake titled Outcast: Second Contact was released for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. ==Gameplay== Gameplay screenshot of Cutter Slade riding a twon- ha The player controls the protagonist Cutter Slade around the alien world of Adelpha in a third-person or first-person view, and only uses two mouse buttons; The right mouse button aims the player's weapon, and the other is context-sensitive (For example, standing in front of an NPC makes the mouse button initiate conversation, while running around has the mouse button make Cutter jump). The player can walk, run, jump, crawl, and climb onto virtually any ledge Cutter can reach with a jump. Aside from the tutorial area, the player is free to move to any region of Adelpha as they please through the travel gates known as daokas. The player can drop teleport beacons from the F-LINK gadget to instantly move between areas inside a region, but these beacons do not work between regions. The player can also acquire a twon-ha (a beast of burden that can be ridden), which makes traversing the vast regions much quicker, either by simply buying one or doing certain quests that reward the player with one. A large part of the game focuses on conversing with the friendly aliens known as the Talan in order to learn the story and history of Adelpha, and to progress in Cutter's mission to find the probe. While this can all be skipped, they treat the player differently depending on how the player treats them, through a reputation system; If the player performs many tasks to help them, they like them more and are more eager to help, whereas if the player does things that harm them they will become more and more angry with the player and aggressively dismiss them. There are multiple variations of dialogues which are selected either randomly or based on the player's reputation. Each weapon in the game fires slow-moving projectiles, requiring the player to constantly maneuver to avoid the enemy soldiers' attacks, and carefully aiming so that the player's will connect. Alternatively, the player can sneak around the enemy, by use of standing behind cover, lying down in a muddy field, using gadgets that turn you invisible for a short time, and so on. Cutter begins the game with just a pistol and his fists, and the player can buy more weapons (and upgrades for those weapons) whenever they have the money, while ammunition can either be found in the world, or crafted by taking a certain amount of materials to a Talan known as a Recreator. Soldiers will sound different alarms with a horn-like instrument when they see the player, to give orders to others nearby. They will try to move behind the player in order to flank them, and search the area or call for a meeting when they can no longer find them. In addition to soldiers, the hostile and less intelligent Adelphan wildlife will also try to fight the player if they come too close. The enemy soldiers can be weakened by performing a certain task for the leader of each region. When this is done, they will stop producing resources for the soldiers: stopping food production lowers their health, stopping the mining operations makes their weapons less powerful, etc. A good reputation is necessary to convince the Talan to stop production of resources, so the player is encouraged to be good to the Talan. Outcast uses a unique way to save games, integrated with the game world. At the start of the game, the player receives an object called a \\"Gaamsaav\\". He is instructed that the Gaamsaav is able to \\"capture his essence\\", so that it may later be restored. To save a game, the player equips the Gaamsaav and \\"squeezes\\" it, making it glow and emit a sound. The sound can be heard by enemies and they will investigate, so that the player must take the situation into account before saving a game. After a few seconds, the game pauses and a menu overlay appears. ==Plot== In 2007, the U.S. government successfully sends a probe to Adelpha, an alien world in a parallel universe. The probe starts transmitting video images of the world back to Earth. Then, just minutes into the mission, an alien life form discovers the probe and damages it, causing an unforeseen backlash of energy that creates a black hole, threatening Earth. After being briefed on the situation by his old friend Major Vernon, former U.S. Navy SEAL Cutter Slade is given the job of escorting three scientists (William Kauffmann, Anthony Xue and Marion Wolfe) on a mission to this alien world to repair the probe and close the black hole. Arriving in Adelpha, Cutter is separated from the three scientists and, to his surprise, is hailed by the natives as their messiah, the Ulukai. The main population of Adelpha are a bipedal species called the Talan. Their technology is comparable to those of ancient China or medieval Europe, however they have psychic abilities that vary depending on each Talan's \\"essence\\": fire, earth, water, or spirit. Talan soldiers with the fae (fire) essence use energy weapons that are powered by their psychic abilities. Adelpha is split into several regions that are connected by a system of intercontinental portals known as daokas. These are relics of an ancient civilization, about which the Talan know little. At the time of Cutter's arrival the fire Talan have taken over society and rule through violence and intimidation. This is a relatively recent state of affairs; previously the Talan lived in harmony. As the game progresses, Cutter learns that the four members of the expedition were separated not in location, but in time. Marion arrives shortly after Cutter, but Kauffmann and Xue arrived decades earlier, and the original probe hasn't arrived yet. Upon learning of their predicament Xue became unstable, fell out with Kauffmann, and took over the Talan warrior caste, teaching them to be violent and xenophobic. This directly led to a Talan warrior attacking the probe on sight when it arrives, causing the creation of the black hole that threatens the Earth. Kauffmann realised that he couldn't stop Xue, and started the cult of the Ulukai among the non-warrior Talan before his death, preparing them to help Cutter when he arrives. Cutter weakens the warrior Talan and unites the other castes, and ultimately defeats Xue and his warriors. With Marion's help, he retrieves the lost computer cards needed to repair the probe. Marion is killed by Xue before the repairs can be completed. Following instructions left by Kauffmann, Cutter repairs the probe and strips down its internals so he can use it as a vehicle to return to Earth, where the return of the probe was expected to close the black hole. ==History== ===Development=== Outcast's graphics engine is mainly a combination of a ray casting (heightmap) engine, used to render the landscape, and a texture mapping polygon engine used to render objects. The \\"Engine Programming\\" section of the credits in the manual has several subsections related to graphics, among them: \\"Landscape Engine\\", \\"Polygon Engine\\", \\"Water & Shadows Engine\\" and \\"Special effects Engine\\". Although Outcast is often cited as a forerunner of voxel technology, this is somewhat misleading. The game does not actually model three-dimensional volumes of voxels. Instead, it models the ground as a surface, which may be seen as being made up of voxels. The ground is decorated with objects that are modeled using texture-mapped polygons. When Outcast was developed, the term \\"voxel engine\\", when applied to computer games, commonly referred to a ray casting engine (for example the Voxel Space engine). On the engine technology page of the game's website, the landscape engine is also referred to as the \\"Voxels engine\\". The engine is purely software-based; it does not rely on hardware-acceleration via a 3D graphics card. Outcast features effects such as character shadows, depth of field, bump mapping and reflections. Anti-aliasing is used to smooth certain texture boundaries. The heightmap engine renders reliefs with self- occlusion, motion parallax, and silhouettes (but no shadowing)--even for details such as cobblestones. Water surfaces appear both translucent and reflective. The surface appears to reflect the environment (the skybox) and appears rippled with moving waves, which react to the character's movement while in the water. The degree of translucency depends on the viewing angle. The more vertical the angle, the clearer the water appears while the more horizontal the angle, the stronger the reflections. Other visual effects include bloom and lens flares, falling snow, fire, and other glowing particles. The disadvantage of this type of CPU-intensive software-rendering was that Outcast required an extremely powerful CPU (nothing but the most powerful Intel Pentium III processors of the time, in the 500-600 MHz range) and massive amounts of RAM (128 megabytes were recommended) to run at full speed and maximum resolution (512x384). However, these considerations can now be safely ignored, as even low-budget PCs of today significantly surpass those requirements, even to the point that additional software is needed to make the game slow enough to be played. The AI used in Outcast was considered revolutionary at the time it was released. It was based on a proprietary engine codenamed GAIA, for Game Artificial Intelligence with Agents, which was composed by a set of C++ libraries that provided sophisticated control of game characters based on research in distributed AI. Intelligence is represented as a distributed activity over a set of autonomous routines called agents. An agent uses skills, such as hearing, sight, acrobatic, to complete assigned tasks. These agents can interact and even compete with each other to realize a complex task. Outcast features a high-quality orchestral score composed by Lennie Moore and performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and choir. At the time of Outcast's release, orchestral game scores were uncommon, and Moore's achievement was hailed as \\"absolutely top-notch\\". The game's publisher Infogrames released the hour-long score on a soundtrack album and it was later made available for MP3 download on the game's official website. Anyone who owns the original game can listen to the soundtrack by putting disc 2 into a CD player. A Dreamcast port of the original was also planned, but was shelved when the Windows version failed commercially. ===Release=== After Outcast was released, developer Appeal published a series of short films on its website, called \\"Outcast Outtakes\\", which were also included on the DVD version of the game. It was essentially a series of in-game recordings which were made to poke fun at itself, such as Cutter making an advertisement for his backpack that acts much like a magic satchel, by showcasing that he could store house furniture such as doors and chairs in it, or extra scenes involving Nikaa, a Talan whose gender remains under debate to this day. ===Sequel=== In 1999, a sequel, called Outcast II: The Lost Paradise, was originally being developed by Appeal for the PlayStation 2, PC, and GameCube. During development, the company Appeal went bankrupt and development ceased. Appeal had been requesting funds from their publisher to help finish the game for release but this was not granted. Since around 2003 the fan-group Eternal Outcasts had developed a free sequel called Open Outcast. The project initially used the Gothic and later the Crystal Space 3D engines but has now made the step to the CryEngine 2. The project released in 2010 two tech demos (Oasis 1.0 & 1.1) which can be played together with the Crysis Wars demo version. In 2013 the project was moved to CryEngine 3 to be developed as a standalone game rather than a mod. The project was renamed to Outcast: Legacy of the Yods in order to reflect this change. On April 16, 2017, team Eternal Outcasts released the final CryEngine 3 technical Demo along with Steam Greenlight submission of the project. The game was then renamed to Legacy of the Yods, and the word Outcast was removed to avoid copyright issues. ===Re-release=== On April 20, 2010, Outcast was re-released via digital distribution by GOG. The re-released game is compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. This version of the game includes fixes for several of problems, including a community-made patch that negates the need to use a CPU slowdown program, and is generally playable on modern PCs without any extra troubleshooting required. Another small bug (\\"Cyana lighthouse problem\\") was fixed later by the fan community who also created patches which allow higher display resolutions beyond 512x384 and widescreen support. === Revival === On July 3, 2013, it was reported that Yann Robert, Franck Sauer and Yves Grolet of Belgian developer Appeal had acquired the IP from Atari, SA with the intention to revive the franchise. On April 7, 2014, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was launched by members of the original development team with the goal of $600,000 for an HD remake of Outcast. The campaign failed to reach its funding goal with only 45% of the required amount achieved and therefore no money transferred. On December 18, 2014, Outcast was remastered as Outcast 1.1 on Steam and later on GOG.com and Zoom Platform. Outcast 1.1 was built and recompiled from the original source code with improved stability, higher resolution support (max. 1920x1080 due to fixed-point z-buffer), and multi-threaded rendering support. Also, there is ongoing work on patching out remaining bugs and glitches by the developers. An official remake, titled Outcast: Second Contact, was released on November 14, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was developed by Appeal, while Bigben Interactive served as the game's publisher. ==Reception== ===Outcast=== ====Sales==== Outcast sold 12,571 copies in the United States by the end of 1999, according to tracking firm PC Data. In the German market, it debuted at #3 on Media Control's computer game sales chart for June 1999. The title held a position in the top 5 through August, and remained at 10th during the first half of September, before falling to 19th in the last two weeks of that month. By December, its sales in the German market had surpassed 50,000 units, which Udo Hoffman of PC Player called \\"a nice number\\". Global sales of Outcast ultimately reached 400,000 units by 2002. ====Critical reviews==== The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Writing in 2009, GamesRadar+ praised the game as \\"revolutionary\\", noting that its freedom to explore a three-dimensional open world preceded Grand Theft Auto III by two years. GameSpot and Computer Gaming World named Outcast the best adventure game of 1999. The latter publication's editors wrote, \\"It was a slim year for adventure games, to be sure, but that in no way should diminish the achievement of Outcast.\\" The game was also nominated in this category by Computer Games Strategy Plus and CNET Gamecenter, losing to Gabriel Knight 3; and in the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' \\"Adventure/Role-Playing Game of the Year\\" category, which went to Asheron's Call. Adam Pavlacka reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you're tired of FPS madness – and you've got some serious horsepower – give Outcast a try. Soon you'll be drawn into a world of beauty and intrigue, and won't want to leave.\\" ====Second Contact==== Second Contact received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was nominated for \\"Best Original Choral Composition\\" with \\"Marion\\" at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards. ==References* *Outcast website by Franck Sauer, one of the game's developers Category:1999 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Bigben Interactive games Category:Cancelled Dreamcast games Category:Infogrames games Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games developed in Belgium Category:Video games set in 2007 Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Video games with voxel graphics Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Outcast (video game)"},{"id":"1423417","text":"A rota (, ) is an infantry or cavalry unit.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Državna Tiskarna, p. 20.) is a town on the left bank of the Sava River in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Sevnica. It is one of the three major settlements in the Lower Sava Valley. The old town of Sevnica lies beneath Sevnica Castle, which is perched on top of Castle Hill, while the new part of town stretches along the plain among the hills up the Sava Valley, forming another town core at the confluence of the Sevnična and Sava rivers.Sevnica municipal site ==Name== The settlement was first attested in written records in 1275 in German as Liechtenwalde (and as Lihtenwalde in 1309, Lietenueld in 1344, Liechtenwald in 1347, and Sielnizza in 1581). The Slovene name is probably derived from a hydronym referring to Sevnična Creek (first attested in 1488 as Zellnitz). This name is derived from the adjective se(d)lьnъ 'belonging to a settlement, village'. The Slovene name is not connected to the German name, which refers to deciduous woods. In the past the German name of the town was Lichtenwald. ==History== Sevnica Castle with the \\"Lutheran Cellar\\", where the Slovene Protestant author Jurij Dalmatin preached in the 16th century For centuries, the town of Sevnica was situated on the border of two historical regions of the Habsburg Empire: Carniola and Styria. It was first mentioned in written documents dating to 1275 by its German name Lichtenwalde. At that time, it was one of the most important settlements along the lower Sava. Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, it was an exclave of the Prince- Archbishopric of Salzburg. It was seized by the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I in 1490, as a retaliation for the Archbishop's alliance with Matthias Corvinus in the war waged against the Habsburgs. Thereafter, it was incorporated in the Duchy of Styria until 1918. In 1322 it acquired the status of a market town, with extended market rights in 1513. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, it suffered greatly from frequent Ottoman raids and never fully recovered its previous wealth. In the 16th century it was an important center of Protestant reformation in the Slovene Lands; the Slovene Lutheran author Jurij Dalmatin also preached in the town. Between 1809 and 1813, it was a border town between the French-administered Illyrian Provinces and the Austrian Empire. In the mid-19th century, it became an important center of the Slovene national revival; in 1869, it hosted one of the first mass rallies in favor of a United Slovenia. In 1862 it received a railway connection, which boosted the local economy. In 1938 railway from Sevnica to Trebnje was completed. During World War II, when the area was annexed by Nazi Germany, the majority of its Slovene inhabitants were expelled and replaced by ethnic Germans resettled from Gottschee County. Many locals died in Nazi concentration camps. After the war, the town started developing as an industrial center in the newly named Lower Sava Valley. ===Mass graves=== Sevnica is the site of four known mass graves associated with the Second World War. Three of them contain the remains of undetermined victims. The Vrtača Mass Grave () is located in the woods west of the hamlet of Vrtača. The Florian Street Mass Grave () is located on the north edge of a large field next to a small woods. The Hraste Mass Grave () is located among the vineyards above the houses on Trubar Street (). The Dobrava Mass Grave () is located in a thicket north of the house at Trubar Street no. 7. It contains the remains of German soldiers. ==Church== The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It was built in 1862 on the site of a 15th-century building. Other churches in town are dedicated to Saint Florian, the Mother of God and Saint Anne, all belonging to the same parish. ==Economy== The company Lisca, one of the largest lingerie companies in Europe, is based in Sevnica. Another important company is the furniture manufacturing company Stilles. ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Sevnica include: *Fridolin Kaučič (sl) (1859–1922), biographerSlovenski biografski leksikon: Kaučič Fridolin. *Anton Jurij Luby (1749–1802), theology professorSlovenski biografski leksikon: Luby Anton Jurij. *Danimir Kerin (born 1922), chemistAdamič, France. 1991. \\"Kerin Danimir.\\" Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 5, p. 53.

On many farms, the outdoors ranging area is fenced, thereby technically making this an enclosure, however, free range systems usually offer the opportunity for the extensive locomotion and sunlight that is otherwise prevented by indoor housing systems. Free range may apply to meat, eggs or dairy farming. The term is used in two senses that do not overlap completely: as a farmer-centric description of husbandry methods, and as a consumer-centric description of them. There is a diet where the practitioner only eats meat from free-range sources called ethical omnivorism. In ranching, free-range livestock are permitted to roam without being fenced in, as opposed to fenced-in pastures. In many agriculture-based economies, free-range livestock are quite common. ==History== Free range ducks in Hainan Province, China If one allows \\"free range\\" to include \\"herding\\", free range was a typical husbandry method at least until the development of barbed wire and chicken wire. The generally poor understanding of nutrition and diseases before the twentieth century made it difficult to raise many livestock species without giving them access to a varied diet, and the labor of keeping livestock in confinement and carrying all their feed to them was prohibitive except for high-profit animals such as dairy cattle. In the case of poultry, free range was the dominant system until the discovery of vitamins A and D in the 1920s, which allowed confinement to be practised successfully on a commercial scale. Before that, green feed and sunshine (for the vitamin D) were necessary to provide the necessary vitamin content.Heuser, G. F: \\"Feeding Poultry\\", page 11. Norton Creek Press, 2003. Some large commercial breeding flocks were reared on pasture into the 1950s. Nutritional science resulted in the increased use of confinement for other livestock species in much the same way. ==United States== In the United States, the USDA free range regulations currently apply only to poultry and indicate that the animal has been allowed access to the outside. The USDA regulations do not specify the quality or size of the outside range nor the duration of time an animal must have access to the outside.Egg Carton Labels: A brief guide to labels and animal welfare The Humane Society of the United States. Updated March 2009. The term \\"free range\\" is mainly used as a marketing term rather than a husbandry term, meaning something on the order of, \\"low stocking density,\\" \\"pasture-raised,\\" \\"grass- fed,\\" \\"old-fashioned,\\" \\"humanely raised,\\" etc. There have been proposals to regulate USDA labeling of products as free range within the United States. what constitutes raising an animal \\"free range\\" is almost entirely decided by the producer of that product, and is frequently inconsistent with consumer ideas of what the term means. ===Free-range poultry=== Free range meat chickens seek shade on a U.S. farm. In poultry-keeping, \\"free range\\" is widely confused with yarding, which means keeping poultry in fenced yards. Yarding, as well as floorless portable chicken pens (\\"chicken tractors\\") may have some of the benefits of free-range livestock but, in reality, the methods have little in common with the free-range method. A behavioral definition of free range is perhaps the most useful: \\"chickens kept with a fence that restricts their movements very little.\\" This has practical implications. For example, according to Jull, \\"The most effective measure of preventing cannibalism seems to be to give the birds good grass range.\\" De-beaking was invented to prevent cannibalism for birds not on free range, and the need for de-beaking can be seen as a litmus test for whether the chickens' environment is sufficiently \\"free-range-like.\\" The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) requires that chickens raised for their meat have access to the outside in order to receive the free-range certification. There is no requirement for access to pasture, and there may be access to only dirt or gravel . Free-range chicken eggs, however, have no legal definition in the United States. Likewise, free-range egg producers have no common standard on what the term means. The broadness of \\"free range\\" in the U.S. has caused some people to look for alternative terms. \\"Pastured poultry\\" is a term promoted by farmer/author Joel Salatin for broiler chickens raised on grass pasture for all of their lives except for the initial brooding period. The Pastured Poultry concept is promoted by the American Pastured Poultry Producers' Association (APPPA), an organization of farmers raising their poultry using Salatin's principles. ===Free-range livestock=== Traditional American usage equates \\"free range\\" with \\"unfenced,\\" and with the implication that there was no herdsman keeping them together or managing them in any way. Legally, a free-range jurisdiction allowed livestock (perhaps only of a few named species) to run free, and the owner was not liable for any damage they caused. In such jurisdictions, people who wished to avoid damage by livestock had to fence them out; in others, the owners had to fence them in. The USDA has no specific definition for \\"free-range\\" beef, pork, and other non-poultry products. All USDA definitions of \\"free-range\\" refer specifically to poultry. In a December 2002 Federal Register notice and request for comments (67 Fed. Reg. 79552), USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service proposed \\"minimum requirements for livestock and meat industry production/marketing claims\\". Many industry claim categories are included in the notice, including breed claims, antibiotic claims, and grain fed claims. \\"Free Range, Free Roaming, or Pasture Raised\\" would be defined as \\"livestock that have had continuous and unconfined access to pasture throughout their life cycle\\" with an exception for swine (\\"continuous access to pasture for at least 80% of their production cycle\\"). In a May 2006 Federal Register notice (71 Fed. Reg. 27662), the agency presented a summary and its responses to comments received in the 2002 notice, but only for the category \\"grass (forage) fed\\" which the agency stated was to be a category separate from \\"free range.\\" Comments received for other categories, including \\"free range,\\" are to be published in future Federal Register editions. == European Union == Small-scale free range farming in the Northern Black Forest The European Union regulates marketing standards for egg farming which specifies the following (cumulative) minimum conditions for the free-range method: * hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities, * the open-air runs to which hens have access is mainly covered with vegetation and not used for other purposes except for orchards, woodland and livestock grazing if the latter is authorised by the competent authorities, * the open-air runs must at least satisfy the conditions specified in Article 4(1)(3)(b)(ii) of Directive 1999/74/EC whereby the maximum stocking density is not greater than 2500 hens per hectare of ground available to the hens or one hen per 4m2 at all times and the runs are not extending beyond a radius of 150 m from the nearest pophole of the building; an extension of up to 350 m from the nearest pophole of the building is permissible provided that a sufficient number of shelters and drinking troughs within the meaning of that provision are evenly distributed throughout the whole open-air run with at least four shelters per hectare.Commission Regulation for marketing standards for eggs - page 25 geese in Germany Otherwise, egg farming in EU is classified into 4 categories: Organic (ecological), Free Range, Barn, and Cages.) The mandatory labelling on the egg shells attributes a number (which is the first digit on the label) to each of these categories: 0 for Organic, 1 for Free Range, 2 for Barn and 3 for Cages. There are EU regulations about what free-range means for laying hens and broilers (meat chickens) as indicated above. However, there are no EU regulations for free-range pork, so pigs could be indoors for some of their lives. In order to be classified as free-range, animals must have access to the outdoors for at least part of their lives. === United Kingdom === Free range pigs in England Pigs: Free-range pregnant sows are kept in groups and they are often provided with straw for bedding, rooting and chewing. Around 40% of UK sows are kept free-range outdoors and farrow in huts on their range. Egg laying hens: Cage-free egg production includes barn, free-range and organic systems. In the UK, free-range systems are the most popular of the non-cage alternatives, accounting for around 57% of all eggs, compared to 2% in barns and 2% organic. In free-range systems, hens are housed to a similar standard as the barn or aviary. Free-range rearing of pullets: Free range rearing of pullets for egg-laying is now being pioneered in the UK by various poultry rearing farms. In these systems, the pullets are allowed outside from as young as 4 weeks of age, rather than the conventional systems where the pullets are reared in barns and allowed out at 16 weeks of age Meat chickens: Free-range broilers are reared for meat and are allowed access to an outdoor range for at least 8 hours each day. Free-range broiler systems use slower- growing breeds of chicken to improve welfare, meaning they reach slaughter weight at 16 weeks of age rather than 5–6 weeks of age in standard rearing systems. Turkeys: Free-range turkeys have continuous access to an outdoor range during the daytime. The range should be largely covered in vegetation and allow more space. Access to fresh air and daylight means better eye and respiratory health. The turkeys are able to exercise and exhibit natural behaviour resulting in stronger, healthier legs. Free-range systems often use slower-growing breeds of turkey. Free range dairy: In recent years the free range dairy scheme has become more prevalent. Farms supplying milk under the free range dairy brand abide by the pasture promise, meaning the cows will have access to pasture land to graze for a minimum of 180 days and nights a year. There is evidence to suggest that milk from grass contains higher levels of fats such as omega-3 and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Additionally free range dairy is giving consumers more choice as to where their milk comes from. Free range dairy provides the consumer with reassurance that the milk they drink has come from cows with the freedom to roam and can graze in their natural habitat. == Australia == Australian standards in relation to free- range production are largely espoused in third-party certification trade marks due to the absence of any significant legally binding legislation. A number of certification bodies are utilised by rearers to identify their products with a particular level of animal welfare standards. In events where producers do not choose to use a certified trade mark and merely state that their product is 'free range', the producer is bound by consumer expectations and perceptions of what constitutes free range.Initial Findings on 20,000 birds/ha free range CTM Producers are generally thought to be bound to Model Codes of Practice of Animal Welfare published by the CSIRO, and in some states this forms part of legislation. === Egg laying hens === In Australia, three farming methods for the production of eggs are utilised. In 2011, traditional cage (or battery) eggs accounted for 42% of value, barn-laid eggs account for 10% of value, free-range eggs accounted for 44% of value, and organic eggs accounted for 4% of value. Increased demand for free range eggs due to customer concerns over animal welfare has led to a number of different standards developing in relation to three core welfare measures - indoor stocking density, outdoor stocking density, and beak trimming. The Model Code of Practice recommends practices for free range farming with the following standards: * Maximum stocking densities indoors of 30 kg/m2, equivalent to about 14-15 birds/m2. * Maximum outdoor stocking density of 1500 birds/ha, although this can be increased with rotation onto fresh pasture * Access to the outdoor range for a minimum of 8 hours per day, except in adverse weather conditions * 2 metres worth of popholes per 1,000 birds for access to the range * Beak trimming is permitted, and to be undertaken by an accredited operator The above standards are not always met, and on some occasions producers may want more ethical standards. As such, certified trade marks play a significant role in the determining of what constitutes free range. The key certifications used for layer hens in Australia include the following... Egg Corp Assured is the weakest standard, set by the industry peak group and largely based on the Model Code of Practice. Egg Corp Assured differs in that it interprets the outdoor stocking density figure as largely irrelevant to welfare. Egg Corp Assured has been known to certify farms running up to 44,000 birds per hectare outdoors, far in excess of recommendations. Like the Model Code of practice, beak trimming is allowed and indoor densities run up to 15 birds per m2. RSPCA Approved Farming is a standard that can be applied to both barn-laid and free- range egg producers. Farms using this certification must have an indoor density of 9 birds/m2 indoors on slats, or 7 birds/m2 indoors in a deep-litter system. The standards dictate a maximum outdoor density of 1500 per ha without rotation, or 2500 birds per ha with rotation, and beak trimming is allowed. Free Range Egg & Poultry Australia (FREPA) standards provides a sliding scale for indoor density, with 10 birds/m2 allowed only in enclosures housing less than 1,000 birds, and 6 birds/m2 the maximum for barns with over 4,000 birds. Nothing is said in the standards about outdoor density, thus it is assumed that farmers must meet the standards under the Model Code. Beak trimming is allowed under this certification.Layer Standards Humane Choice True Free Range standards are some of the most sound as far as animal welfare is concerned. Beak trimming or any other mutilations is not permitted, perches must be provided, and maximum flock numbers cannot be greater than 2,500 per barn. The outdoor stocking density is 1500 birds per ha, and the indoor density is 5 birds per m2. Australian Certified Organic Standards include criteria on feed content and the use of pesticides in addition to animal welfare requirements. The indoor density is a maximum of 8 birds/m2, although most operators under this standard list their density as 5 birds per m2. The outdoor density is 1000 birds per ha, and beak trimming is not permitted. === Chicken meat === In Australia, free range and organic chicken accounts for about 16.6% of value in the poultry market. This percentage is expected to grow to up to 25% in the next 5 years. No meat birds are raised in cages in Australia. There are three main certification trademarks in this market. Free Range Egg & Poultry Australia (FREPA) standards are those in which most supermarket brands of free range chicken meat are accredited under. These standards require indoor stocking densities of up to 30 kg per m2 indoors (about 15 birds per m2), and beak trimming is not permitted. Outdoor stocking density is not stated, but it is understood that the outdoor range must be at a minimum 1.5 times the floor area of inside the barn. RSPCA Approved Farming standards for free range require an indoor stocking density of about 17 birds per m2, and outdoor densities of up to 17 birds per m2. No beak trimming is allowed under this system. Australian Certified Organic standards dictate a maximum indoor stocking density of up to 12 birds per m2 indoors, and 2500 birds per hectare outdoors. These standards require perches, and prevent large, conventional broiler sheds. == See also == * Ethical consumerism * Free range eggs * Grass- fed beef * Organic eggs * Chickens as pets * Grazing * Ethical omnivorism * Yarding ==References== Category:Animal welfare Category:Ethical consumerism Category:Livestock Category:Poultry farming ","title":"Free range"},{"id":"1423444","text":"The Sutlej River (alternatively spelled as Satluj River; Sanskrit: शतद्रु नदी Shatadru nadee; Hindi: सतलज नदी satalaj nadee; , Satluj nadi; ) is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan. The Sutlej River is also known as Satadree. It is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River.The bharka dam is built around the river Sutlej to provide irrigation and other facilities to the nearby areas. The waters of the Sutlej are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and are mostly diverted to irrigation canals in India. The mean annual flow is 14 million acre feet (MAF) upstream of Ropar barrage, downstream of the Bhakra dam. It has several major hydroelectric points, including the 1,325 MW Bhakra Dam, the 1,000 MW Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant, and the 1,500 MW Nathpa Jhakri Dam. The drainage basin is mainly in India's Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana states. ==Sources== The source of the Sutlej is west of the catchment area of Lake Rakshastal in Tibet, as springs in an ephemeral stream. Lake Rakshastal used to be part of the Sutlej river basin long ago and separated from the Sutlej due to tectonic activity. The nascent river flows at first west-northwest for about under the Tibetan name Langqên Zangbo (Elephant River or Elephant Spring) to the Shipki La pass, entering India in Himachal Pradesh state. It then has its main knee heading west-southwest for about to meet the Beas River near Makhu, Firozpur district, Punjab state. Ropar Wetland in Punjab state is located on the Sutlej river basin. Evidence suggests Indus Valley Civilisation also flourished here. Ungti Chu and Pare Chu rivers which drain southeastern part of Jammu and Kashmir state are tributaries of Sutlej river. Continuing west-southwest, the Sutlej enters Pakistan about east of Bhedian Kalan, Kasur District, Punjab province, continuing southwest to water the ancient and historical former Bahawalpur princely state. Few centuries ago, Sutlej river was merging with the Ghaggar river to discharge in to the Arabian sea. In approx. 1797 BC, the course of the Sutlej river moved towards north to join the Beas river. About north of Uch Sharif, the Sutlej unites with the Chenab River, forming the Panjnad River, which finally flows into the Indus river about west of the city of Bahawalpur. The area to the southeast on the Pakistani side of the Indian border is called the Cholistan Desert and, on the Indian side, the Thar Desert. The Indus then flows through a gorge near Sukkur and the fertile plains region of Sindh, forming a large delta region between the border of Gujarat, India and Pakistan, finally terminating in the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi, Pakistan. During floods, Indus river water flows in to Indian part of Great Rann of Kutch. Thus Gujarat state of India is also a riparian state of Indus river as Rann of Kutch area lying west of Kori Creek in the state is part of the Indus River Delta. == Langqên Zangbo == Langqên Zangbo (; ) is a river in Ngari, Tibet, China. The name Langqên, Tibetan for \\"elephant\\", is because of a valley that resembles an elephant trunk. This river is the main source of the Sutlej, a tributary of Indus River. It enters India at Shipki La pass. The source is south of Gangdise Range, in Ngari Prefecture. Its course is mainly in the Zanda County. The river drains an area of 22,760 km2, and covers a length of 309 km. The drop in height is 3,256 m. Historically, the river was the centre of the Zhangzhung Kingdom until its fall in the 8th century AD. ==Geology== The Sutlej, along with all of the Punjab rivers, is thought to have drained east into the Ganges prior to 5 mya. There is substantial geologic evidence to indicate that prior to 1700 BC, and perhaps much earlier, the Sutlej was an important tributary of the Ghaggar-Hakra River (thought to be the legendary Sarasvati River) rather than the Indus, with various authors putting the redirection from 2500 to 2000 BC,Mughal, M. R. Ancient Cholistan. Archaeology and Architecture. Rawalpindi-Lahore-Karachi: Ferozsons 1997, 2004 from 5000 to 3000 BC,Valdiya, K. S., in Dynamic Geology, Educational monographs published by J. N. Centre for Advanced Studies, Bangalore, University Press (Hyderabad), 1998. or before 8000 BC.*Clift et al. 2012. \\"U-Pb zircon dating evidence for a Pleistocene Sarasvati River and capture of the Yamuna River.\\" Geology, v. 40. Geologists believe that tectonic activity created elevation changes which redirected the flow of Sutlej from the southeast to the southwest.K.S. Valdiya. 2013. \\"The River Saraswati was a Himalayan-born river\\". Current Science 104 (01). If the diversion of the river occurred recently (about 4000 years ago), it may have been responsible for the Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) drying up, causing desertification of Cholistan and the eastern part of the modern state of Sindh, and the abandonment of Harappan settlements along the Ghaggar. However, the Sutlej may have already been captured by the Indus thousands of years earlier. There is some evidence that the high rate of erosion caused by the modern Sutlej River has influenced the local faulting and rapidly exhumed rocks above Rampur. This would be similar to, but on a much smaller scale than, the exhumation of rocks by the Indus River in Nanga Parbat, Pakistan. The Sutlej River also exposes a doubled inverted metamorphic gradient. ==Sutlej-Yamuna Link== There has been a proposal to build a long heavy freight and irrigation canal, to be known as the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) to connect the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers.http://india.gov.in/sectors/water_resources/sutlej_link.php Sutlej- Yamuna Link The project is intended to connect the Ganges, which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west, via Pakistan. When completed, the SYL would enable inland shipping from India's east coast to its west coast (on the Arabian sea) without having to round the southern tip of India by sea, vastly shortening shipping distances, alleviating pressures on seaports, avoiding sea hazards, creating business opportunities along the route, raising real estate values, raising tax revenue, and establishing important commercial links and providing jobs for north-central India's large population. However, the proposal has met with obstacles and has been referred to the Supreme Court of India. To augment nearly 100 tmcft water availability for the needs of this link canal, Tso Moriri lake/Lingdi Nadi (a tributary of Tso Moriri lake) waters can be diverted to the Sutlej basin by digging a 10 km long gravity canal to connect to the Ungti Chu river. ==History== The Upper Sutlej Valley, called Langqên Zangbo in Tibet, was once known as the Garuda Valley by the Zhangzhung, the ancient civilization of western Tibet. The Garuda Valley was the centre of their empire, which stretched many miles into the nearby Himalayas. The Zhangzhung built a towering palace in the Upper Sutlej Valley called Kyunglung, the ruins of which still exist today near the village of Moincêr, southwest of Mount Kailash (Mount Ti-se). Eventually, the Zhangzhung were conquered by the Tibetan Empire. Today, the Sutlej Valley is inhabited by nomadic descendants of the Zhangzhung, who live in tiny villages of yak herders. The Sutlej was the main medium of transportation for the kings of that time. In the early 18th century, it was used to transport devdar woods for Bilaspur district, Hamirpur district, and other places along the Sutlej's banks. Of four rivers (Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra and Karnali/Ganges) mythically flowing out of holy Lake Manasarovar, the Sutlej is actually connected by channels that are dry most of the time. Earlier the river was also called as Shutudri or Zaradros river. https://www.britannica.com/place/Sutlej-River ==Gallery== Image:Sutlej Valley from Rampur ca. 1857.jpgSutlej Valley from Rampur c. 1857 File:Crossing the Sutlej near Simla upon inflated animal skins.jpegUsing inflated animal skins to cross the Sutlej River, c. 1905 File:Kinnaur 392.jpgSutlej River in Kinnaur Valley, Himachal Pradesh, India File:Satluj P012.JPGCattle grazing on the banks of the river in Rupnagar, Punjab, India File:Satluj river.JPGSatluj River near Shahkot, Punjab, India File:\\"Hungarung Pass in the Himalayas\\" (nowadays called Shipki La, where the Sutlej River enters India from Tibet), from the Illustrated London News, 1856.jpgSutlej entering India from Tibet near Shipki La, c. 1856 ==See also== * List of rivers of India * List of rivers of Pakistan * Cis-Sutlej states * Sulemanki Headworks * Geology of the Himalaya == References == ==External links== * Sutlej basin marked on OpenStreetMap. * Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal is So Controversial?Wissurge,26 August 2020 Category:Tributaries of the Indus River Category:Indus basin Category:Rivers of the Tibet Autonomous Region Category:Rivers of Sindh Category:International rivers of Asia Category:Rivers of Himachal Pradesh Category:Rivers of Punjab, India Category:Rigvedic rivers Category:India–Pakistan border Category:Border rivers Category:Rivers of India Category:Rivers of Punjab (Pakistan) Category:Rivers in Buddhism Category:Rivers of Pakistan ","title":"Sutlej"},{"id":"1423447","text":"racing pigeons in Rosebank Homes and apartment buildings on Hylan Boulevard in Rosebank Rosebank is a neighborhood in the northeastern part of Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City. It is bordered by Clifton to the north, Arrochar to the south, and the Upper New York Bay to the east. ==History== Originally called Peterstown, then called Clifton, Village of Edgewater, the name \\"Rosebank\\" appears to have been first used to denote the neighborhood around 1880. Before 1880, the area was the \\"Newport RI\\" of the USA. The area was home to great estates, some of the richest families in the country had mansions along the shore and inland. The New York Yacht Club summer house was (still stands) next to the Alice Austen House. The Vanderbilts, Aspinwalls and Townsends built and attended St John's Episcopal Church. The first baptism at that church History of Our Church. St. John's Episcopal Church Accessed July 30, 2017 was Cornelius Vanderbilt II, whose father donated Vanderbilt University. The big farms and estates were divided up into small parcels and soon after 1880 Italian immigrants began settling there, and their descendants have continued as its predominant ethnic group, exemplified by the location of the Garibaldi Memorial in the community. The neighborhood once played host to a federal quarantine station for incoming immigrants (closed 1971), and was the home of noted photographer Alice Austen, one of Staten Island's most recognizable personalities of the past. The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum is named for a longtime resident, Antonio Meucci, who has some claim to having been an inventor of a working telephone. However, impoverished, he was unable to obtain a patent or to market it. When Giuseppe Garibaldi visited the United States while in exile from Italy, he stayed for a time at the home of Meucci. This home is now a museum named for the two men. Eibs Pond park served as a filming location for Womanhood, the Glory of the Nation (1917) Wheeler, Edward Jewett and Crane, Frank.

The archdiocese formerly operated St. Mary School in Rosebank. In its final year it had 224 students, 90% of the building's capacity. The archdiocese decided to close it in 2011; Amy Padnani of Silive.com stated that despite the high utilization of the building, it was one of Staten Island's oldest Catholic school facilities and therefore \\"some speculate the school was chosen because of infrastructure problems\\". St. Joseph's School in Rosebank closed in 2013. That year it had 167 students. ==Transportation== After the elimination of the Bachmann station, Rosebank was the first stop on the now-defunct South Beach Branch of the Staten Island Railway after it diverged from the main line at the Clifton station immediately to the north. Service on this branch was halted in 1953. The station was located near Clifton Avenue and Tilson Place. Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island's and New York City's longest commercial roadway, begins in Rosebank on its way to Tottenville, about 14 miles (22.5 km) away The local buses travel on Tompkins Avenue, and the buses serve Bay Street. It is also served by the express buses to and from Manhattan on Narrows Road North.

He is represented by the Duck in the book, a play on his last name. He officiated at the funeral of Charles Darwin in 1882. ==Biography== Duckworth was the second son of Robinson Duckworth Sr. of Liverpool and his wife Elizabeth. He was educated at the Royal Institution School in Liverpool, and later at University College, Oxford, where he took his BA in 1857. He was a member of the Oxford Choral Society and a renowned singer. He took his MA in 1859, and his BD and DD in 1879. He was an Assistant Master at Marlborough College from 1857 to 1860. From 1860 to 1876 he was a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, where, from 1866 to 1870, he was Instructor and Governor to Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Queen Victoria's youngest son. In 1864 he was appointed Examining Chaplain to the Bishop of Peterborough. While he was at Oxford Duckworth helped to row Alice Liddell and her sisters (daughters of Dr Liddell, Dean of Christ Church) on the river, returning from a picnic. In the boat was his friend Lewis Carroll who related for the first time his story which became Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

The Slovene name Črna (literally, 'black') arose through ellipsis from *Črna (voda/reka) 'Black Creek'. The designation \\"black\\" may have referred to water with dark silt, water that flowed through a spruce woods, or deep water with no visible bottom.

In the past the German name was Schwarzenbach. ==History== A chapel at Črna in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in an 1137 deed. The settlement has a long ironworking history. A foundry was established by one Mehior Puc, who moved to Črna from the Lavant Valley in 1620, started mining iron ore and built two smelting furnaces, which were among the first in the Eastern Alps. This operation was sold to the Counts of Thurn-Valsassina from nearby Bleiburg in 1624, who built a new ironworking operation on the Meža River at Mušenik to the north of the town in the 18th century. After the Austrian Southern Railway company had built a railway connection to Klagenfurt and Villach at Ravne na Koroškem a few miles down the Meža River, the Counts of Thurn moved operations there and abandoned their ironworks in Črna around 1880. The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Oswald.

Records of 1385 pertaining to the purchase and then sale (back to the previous owner) of a property adjoining the church of St. Thomas of Acre refer to 'Adam Pynkhurst, scriptor et civis Londonie' ('scrivener and citizen of London'), the first record of his membership in the Scriveners Company, in whose 'Common Paper' he inscribed his confirmation ca. 1395. The final record, dated sometime from 1399 to 1401, requests the confirmation of grants made by the previous kings to 'Adam Penkhurst'; these pertain to Sussex and Surrey, suggesting his retirement to his original home. There are no records of any 'Adam Pinkhurst' after 1401 or that place him into contact with Geoffrey Chaucer.Save the Poll Tax record and 1399-1401 petition, these are discussed in Linne R. Mooney, ‘Chaucer’s Scribe’, Speculum, 81 (2006), 97–138; the petition was first discussed in Jane Roberts, ‘On Giving Scribe B a Name and a Clutch of London Manuscripts from c. 1400’, Medium Aevum, 80 (2011), 247-70, and the Poll Tax record, with reference Pinkhurst's career, in Lawrence Warner, Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384-1432 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 2. ==Identification as Chaucer's scribe== In 2004, Linne Mooney and Simon Horobin published an essay arguing that the scribe of the Ellesmere Chaucer and Hengwrt Chaucer manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales, known as 'Scribe B', also copied a Piers Plowman manuscript, Cambridge, Trinity College MS B.15.17.Simon Horobin and Linne R. Mooney, ‘A Piers Plowman Manuscript by the Hengwrt/Ellesmere Scribe and Its Implications for London Standard English’, Studies in the Age of Chaucer, 26 (2004), 65-112. At the conference of the New Chaucer Society that year, and in a major essay published in 2006, Mooney identified this scribe as Adam Pinkhurst and claimed, as Bernard Wagner had in 1929,Bernard Wagner, 'Chaucer's Scrivener,' TLS, June 13, 1929: 474 that he was the referent of a short poem known as Chaucer's words unto Adam his scrivener:Linne R. Mooney, ‘Chaucer’s Scribe’, Speculum, 81 (2006), 97–138. [Adam scrivener, if it ever befalls thee to write Boece or Troilus anew, mayst thou have ringworm under thy long locks unless thou writest more truly after my making, so often a day I must renew thy work, to correct it and also to rub and scrape, and all is through thy negligence and haste.] Mooney took the identification to be 'unmistakable'—she focused on the decorative motifs that adorn both Pinkhurst's entry into the Scriveners Company Common Paper and the Ellesmere Canterbury Tales, calling one of them (two slashes, a dot, two slashes on exaggerated ascenders) his 'signature'— and thus did not mount an argument per se. Her essay also attributed to Pinkhurst the 1387/88 Petitions by the Mercers and the Leathersellers, and some entries in the Mercers' Company Account books from ca. 1392–1427. In 2013 she and Estelle Stubbs claimed that Pinkhurst's hand recorded entries into Letter Book I up to 1410, indicating, they argued, that he had thus been a junior clerk in the Guildhall, working alongside \\"Scribe D\\" (whom they identified as a senior clerk, John Marchaunt), another copyist of the Tales. They disavowed Mooney's earlier attribution of the Mercers' account records after 1393 to Pinkhurst, but still claimed that the life-records discussed above, save the ones about the 'scriptor', refer to the scribe's father or uncle. They also identified a 1393 petition on behalf of John Northampton as Pinkhurst's.Linne R. Mooney and Estelle Stubbs, Scribes and the City: London Guildhall Clerks and the Dissemination of Middle English Literature 1375-1425 (York Medieval Press, 2013). Meantime, the identification of Pinkhurst as Chaucer's own scribe was accepted almost universally, its deep impact on the field felt well beyond teaching and scholarship: Mooney was fictionalized in Amy Rowland's 2014 novel The Transcriptionist, and Pinkhurst in Bruce Holsinger's 2015 historical thriller The Invention of Fire. Mooney's entry on Pinkhurst for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, reserved for 'people who have left their mark on an aspect of national life', was published in 2012.http://www.oxforddnb.com/ The first substantial note of dissension appeared in a 2011 essay by Jane Roberts, who, in fact, had first observed the similarity of the Mercers' Petition and the Ellesmere manuscript, word of which reached Mooney, prompting a collaboration during the early stages of the project that would lead to the latter's single-authored essay.Jane Roberts, ‘On Giving Scribe B a Name and a Clutch of London Manuscripts from c. 1400’, Medium Aevum, 80 (2011), 247-70. Christopher de Hamel likewise expressed skepticism in 2016.Christopher de Hamel, Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts (London: Allen Lane, 2016) In 2018 (building on a 2015 article) Lawrence Warner published the most substantial argument against the identification, claiming that Adam Scryveyne can only be cited as evidence if the question at issue is begged. He further argued that Pinkhurst was in fact scribe of the Piers Plowman manuscript that Horobin and Mooney attributed to Scribe B (i.e., the Hengwrt-Ellesmere scribe), the early entries into the Mercers' account books, and the Northampton petition, but certainly not Hengwrt, Ellesmere, or the 1387/88 petitions, as shown by both paleographical and linguistic evidence. Neither, he proposed, is there any evidence that either Scribe B or Adam Pinkhurst worked in the Guildhall.Lawrence Warner, Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384-1432 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018).

President Bill Clinton in 1993 ==Early life and career== Synar was born in Vinita, Oklahoma, His father, Ed Synar, was a World War II B-24 tailgunner in Europe. His father's family line was Polish Catholics. Mike Synar was graduated from Muskogee High School in 1968. He attended the University of Oklahoma (OU) and graduated in 1972 with a B.S.; later Synar also earned his law degree from OU in 1977. Synar was also a Rotary International Scholar and attended the Graduate School of Economics at the University of Edinburgh (in Scotland) in 1973, and earned an M.A. from Northwestern University in 1974. While Synar's primary profession was the practice of law, he also worked as a rancher and a real estate broker/agent in the Muskogee area. ==Election and service in Congress== He was first elected to Congress in 1978 at the age of 28, by defeating incumbent Ted Risenhoover. Synar's campaign pulled off an upset victory as they circulated copies of a Washington D.C. media report that said Risenhoover slept on a \\"heart-shaped waterbed,\\" which did not play well with the voters back home in Oklahoma. In the Congress, he may be best known for his successful constitutional challenge to the Gramm–Rudman Act. In the 1986 Supreme Court decision Bowsher v. Synar, the Court struck down the law stating, in part, that the provision granting executive power to Comptroller General Charles Arthur Bowsher, a legislative branch officer, did \\"violate the Constitution's command that Congress play no direct role in the execution of the laws.\\" Synar was also an ardent and persistent foe of the tobacco industry. In 1989 Synar served as the lead prosecutor as Congress conducted an impeachment trial of then U.S. federal judge Alcee Hastings, who was impeached on bribery charges and removed from the bench. Ironically, Hastings was later elected to the U.S. Congress from Florida, and was in line to chair the House Select Committee on Intelligence, but was passed over by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In 1992, the House Committee on Government Operations issued its 17th report, known colloquially as \\"the Synar Report\\", but formally as \\"Misplaced Trust: The Bureau of Indian Affairs Mismanagement of the Indian Trust Fund.\\" Synar was Chairman of the Environment, Energy, and Natural Resources Subcommittee, which produced the report for the Committee on Government Operations (Chairman, John Conyers Jr.) at the direction of the 102nd Congress. The Synar Report led to the passage of the Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, and helped to pave the way for the class action lawsuit, Cobell v. Babbitt, initiated in 1996. In 1994, Synar was narrowly defeated in a Democratic primary runoff election by Virgil Cooper, a retired high school principal. Though Cooper's campaign spent less than $20,000 itself, some money was spent by outside interests that were opposed to Synar, including the National Rifle Association, tobacco companies, and cattlemen. Cooper seized on Synar's connections with Japanese businesses with a bumper sticker slogan of \\"Sayonara Synar.\\" Cooper won by just 2,609 votes out of 92,987 cast, a 51-49 margin. Cooper was subsequently defeated in the general election by Republican Tom Coburn by a 52-48 margin. ==After Congress== After Congress, Synar served as the Chairman of the Campaign for America Project and of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. He was also awarded the 1995 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, one of the nation's most prestigious honors for elected public servants. Synar died of a brain tumor on January 9, 1996, at the age of 45. The American College of Physicians offers a national public service award in honor of Rep. Synar's public efforts against tobacco smoking. His name is also attached to the Mike Synar Center at Northeastern State University in Muskogee, Oklahoma. The Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley annually awards up to five graduate research fellowships in honor of Rep. Synar to distinguished graduate students who are writing their dissertations on an aspect of American politics. == See also == * Oklahoma Democratic Party * Politics of Oklahoma * Oklahoma Congressional Districts * United States Congressional Delegations from Oklahoma * List of notable brain tumor patients ==References== == External links == * Mike Synar at Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress * Mike Synar Center at Northeastern State University, Muskogee, OK * 2000 Award to Mike Synar by Taxpayers For Common Sense * Article on 1994 Synar primary loss * Bowsher vs Synar (1986) * American College of Physicians * 1995 JFK Profile in Courage Award Recipient * Sayonara Synar Confirmation Via New York Times * A Civic Thrill: An open letter to Congressman Synar from writer Sarah Vowell * *Michael Lynn \\"Mike\\" Synar Collection at the Carl Albert Center Category:1950 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:American Episcopalians Category:Ranchers from Oklahoma Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington, D.C.

He is a former member of the Alternative Democratic Pole (PDA). In 2009 Garzón joined forces with former Mayors Enrique Peñalosa and Antanas Mockus to re-found the Green Party, an eco-oriented political movement. ==Political career== ===Presidential Candidate=== Considered by some analysts as an idiosyncratic and charismatic speaker, \\"Lucho\\" Garzón has been one of the most visible critics of President Álvaro Uribe's government, running against him on a shoe-string budget in the 2002 presidential race and finally making third place with 680,245 votes (6.16% of the voter turnout). Garzón has expressed his interest in running once again for the Colombian presidential office in the future, after his first failed attempt. A run in the 2006 elections was ruled out as Garzón would have had to resign his post early in 2005 to be considered eligible and at the time of this writing, Antonio Navarro had already been chosen as the Independent Democratic Pole's (PDI) official pre-candidate but Carlos Gaviria became the PDA official candidate. ===Mayor of Bogotá=== Garzón defeated Juan Lozano, the candidate favored by president Uribe and also by influential media groups as El Tiempo in Bogotá, in the mayoral elections in October 2003. Garzón's low budget campaign received a major boost when his candidacy was endorsed by the more leftwing sectors of the Liberal party, in particular those close to then senator Piedad Córdoba. During his tenure as mayor, Garzón was popular amongst the people of Bogotá as reflected in polls, in spite of confronting such difficult issues as the use of public space, the teething problems faced by the TransMilenio mass-transport system, and how to deal with ex-combatants from Colombia's armed conflict who had been settled in Bogotá as part of a central government rehabilitation program (eventually, Garzón and Uribe jointly decided to change some aspects of the program, after a bomb exploded near one of the shelters for former irregular fighters). In the meantime, despite several disagreements, Garzón has managed to achieve a degree of cohabitation with the central government, cooperating on several local issues without compromising his own principles. For supporters and opponents alike, one of the most striking feature of Lucho's administration so far has been its emphasis on social programs such as Bogotá sin hambre (\\"Bogotá without hunger\\") and Bogotá sin indiferencia (\\"Bogotá without indifference\\"), and in general his general efforts to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants of Bogotá's most deprived areas, as well as increasing their involvement in decision making at the level of local government. Towards the end of 2005, Garzón has had a recent conflict with his own party, the PDA, in Bogotá's city council due to his support for a proposed increase in the city's \\"valorization tax\\", in order to finance existing and future infrastructure and development projects. Most PDA and Radical Change councilmen oppose this measure as contrary to Garzón's \\"no new taxes\\" campaign pledge, while Garzón himself and councilmen affiliated with former mayor Enrique Peñalosa consider it necessary. The tax was approved during a September 29 city council vote, by a margin of four votes (24 against 20). ==External links== *Rumbo a las elecciones Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Bogotá Category:Free University of Colombia alumni Category:Green Alliance (Colombia) politicians Category:Independent Democratic Pole politicians Category:Politicians from Bogotá ","title":"Luis Eduardo Garzón"},{"id":"1423500","text":"Jasmin Imamović (born 8 October 1957) is a Bosnian writer and politician who is currently the 31st Mayor of Tuzla, where he succeeded Selim Bešlagić in February 2001.

He is noted for his illustrations of natural history subjects, topographical views, illuminations and mythological works. He was one of the last manuscript illuminators and made a major contribution to the development of topographical drawing. His manuscript illuminations and ornamental designs played an important role in the emergence of floral still-life painting as an independent genre in northern Europe at the end of the 16th century. The almost scientific naturalism of his botanical and animal drawings served as a model for a later generation of Netherlandish artists.Lee Hendrix. \\"Hoefnagel, Joris.\\" Grove Art Online.

As his father likely wished him to enter the family business, he received a comprehensive humanistic education. He spoke, in addition to his native Dutch, several languages and was able to write poetry and play various musical instruments. In one of his works, Hoefnagel described himself as self- taught as an artist. However, according to the early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander he received his first art lessons from Hans Bol, probably in the period 1570-1576 before he permanently left Antwerp. This apprenticeship with Hans Bol is not documented. Hans Bol likely introduced Hoefnagel to miniature painting.Thea Vignau-Wilberg, Joris Hoefnagel, The Illuminator, in: Lee Hendrix, Thea Vignau-Wilberg, Mira Calligraphiae Monumenta: A Sixteenth- Century Calligraphic Manuscript Inscribed by Georg Bocksay and Illuminated by Joris Hoefnagel, Volume 1, Getty Publications, 13 Aug 1992, p. 15-28 ===Travels=== A sloth He lived from 1560 to 1562 in France, where he attended the universities of Bourges and Orléans. Here he probably made his first landscape drawings. He was forced to leave France in 1563 due to religious unrest and he returned to Antwerp. He left soon thereafter for Spain, where he resided from 1563 to 1567 and was active on behalf of the family business. He made various sketches of places in Spain and was particularly fascinated with Seville, the primary colonial trading port of Spain, where he could see many exotic animals and plants. He returned to Antwerp in 1567 but may have visited his hometown in between on business. He travelled to England in 1568 and resided in London for a few months where he built friendships with other Flemish businessmen. After returning to Antwerp in 1569, Joris Hoefnagel married Suzanne van Onchem in 1571 and in 1573 the couple had a son called Jacob, who would also become an artist.Biography of Georg Hoefnagel at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien ===Exile=== After the Sack of Antwerp by Spanish troops during the Eighty Years War in 1576, in which much of the family fortune was lost to plunder, Joris Hoefnagel left his hometown. He traveled in 1577, accompanied by his friend the cartographer Abraham Ortelius, along the Rhine via Frankfurt, Augsburg and Munich to Venice and Rome. The pair also travelled southwards from Rome to Naples and visited various ancient sites. Venus disarms Amor The art patron Hans Fugger and the physician Adolf Occo, whom he met in Augsburg, recommended him to the Duke of Bavaria, Albert V. The Duke was impressed by Hoefnagel's miniatures and promised him a job as a court painter. In Rome he was introduced to the circle of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Thanks to his special ability in miniature painting he was offered by the Cardinal in 1578 the position of the late miniaturist Giulio Clovio. He decided, however, to take on the position at the ducal court in Munich. He lived in Munich for about eight years and worked at the court of the Bavarian dukes Albert V and William V. Hoefnagel was granted the freedom to pursue his own interests and seems to have accepted the post at the ducal court mainly not to be hemmed in by the city and guild rules. He also took on commissions from Fugger and the Este family of Ferrara. In between he worked in Innsbruck at the court of Archduke Ferdinand II. He also continued with his collecting and trading in old master drawings. As a Calvinist, he was forced to leave Munich in 1591 when a rule was imposed that all members of the court had to proclaim their adherence to the Catholic faith. Hoefnagel refused to do so. He then went to work for Emperor Rudolf II, first residing in the city of Frankfurt am Main, where he moved in a circle of Flemish humanists, merchants, artists and publishers. In particular his friendship with the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius may have played an important role in his later botanical illustrations. In 1594, he was forced to leave Frankfurt because of the repression of the Calvinist faith. He worked in his final years in Vienna but made regular visits to Prague. His brother Daniel lived in Vienna, where he ran a business under court protection. At this time Joris Hoefnagel promoted his son Jacob at court. He regularly collaborated with his son on artistic projects. According to Karel van Mander he died in Vienna in 1600 but this is not certain as there continue to be references to him in documents referring to his brother Daniel and his son Jacob after that date. ==Works== Hoefnagel was a very versatile artist. Heis known for his landscapes, emblems, miniatures, grotesques, topographical drawings, genre scenes, and mythological and allegorical drawings and paintings. Part of Hoefnagel's artistic works was kept in the Dutch Republic by Constantijn Huygens when bequeathed to the Huygens family at Hoefnagel's death. These works were seen by Dutch artists and exercised an important influence on the development of Dutch still life and naturalist art.Karel A. E. Enenkel, Paulus Johannes Smith, Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts, Volume 7, Issue 1, Brill, 2007 View of Seville from 'Civitates Orbis Terrarum' ===Landscapes and topographical works=== During his trip to England, he made drawings of royal palaces such as Windsor Castle and Nonsuch Palace, which are regarded as some of the earliest realist landscape watercolours in England. Hoefnagels made many landscape drawings during his travels in Europe. These later served as the models for engravings for Ortelius' Theatrum orbis terrarum (1570) and Braun's Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1572–1618). The Civitates orbis terrarum was with its six volumes the most extensive atlas of its time. Hoefnagel worked intermittently on the Civitates his whole life and may have acted as an agent for the project, by commissioning views from other artists. He also completed more than 60 illustrations himself, including various views in Bavaria, Italy and Bohemia. He enlivened the finished engravings with a Mannerist sense of fantasy and wit by using dramatic perspectives and ornamental cartouches. Due to the topographical accuracy he heralded the realist trend in 17th-century Netherlandish landscape art. His son Jacob reworked in 1617 designs of his father for the sixth volume of the Civitates, which was published in Cologne in 1618. Volume 6 contains a homogeneous series of images of cities in Central Europe (in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary and Transylvania), which are very consistent in their graphics. The views are in perspective, and only in a few cases, isometric and stand out through the accuracy of the information, the particular attention to the faithful representation of the territory, the landscape, the road conditions and the power of observation and refinement of interpretation.Irina Baldescu, Joris e Jacob Hoefnagel - Artisti e Viaggiatori: Territorio e vedute di città in Civitates Orbis Terrarum, Liber Sextus, (Köln 1617-1618), in: Studia Patzinika, 6, 2008, p. 7-35 Patiente cornudo from 'Patientia' ===Emblems=== In England, Hoefnagel also made a set of emblematic drawings entitled Patientia (full title: Traité de la Patience, Par Emblêmes Inventées et desinées par George Hoefnagel à Londres, L’an 1569), which focused on the themes of patience and suffering. The genre-like nature of the work anticipated later Netherlandish emblem books. Patientia also reflected the influence of Neo-stoic philosophy, which was popular in the circle around the Antwerp publisher Christopher Plantin. The book remained in manuscript form and is dated to 1569. The manuscript is kept in the Municipal Library of Rouen, France. One of the emblems from the series is entitled Patiente cornudo (the patient cuckold). It depicts a scene of public punishment of an adulterous woman and her deceived husband, i.e. the 'patient cuckold'. The Catholic Church regarded both husband and wife guilty in the crime of adultery. The husband has his hands tied and he wears on his head two large branches with their offshoots which resemble large deer antlers. Between the tops of the branches hang bells on a rope. After the man rides a woman, her head covered with a veil and her face hidden behind her own hair. She whips her husband with a string of garlic. Behind them is a crier who heralds the crime of the couple. He has a trumpet and a stalk with which he punishes the couple. Hoefnagel reprised this scene in his View of Seville from 'Civitates orbis terrarium'. Added in the View of Seville is a woman on a donkey who is naked from the waist up. She is the procuress who is also punished. The scene further includes figures who ridicule the couple by holding up their fingers in a 'V' form, an allusion to the 'horned' (cuckolded) husband.José Julio García Arranz, El castigo del \\"cornudo paciente\\": un detalle iconográfico en la \\"Vista de Sevilla\\" de Joris Hoefnagel (1593), Universidad de Extremadura: Servicio de Publicaciones, 2008 ===Manuscript illuminations=== Hoefnagel was an accomplished miniature painter and is famous for his miniature work on various manuscripts in the collection of the Habsburg dynasty.Joan Boychuk, Multo in Parvo: Joris Hoefnagel’s Illuminations and the Gathered Practices of Central European Court Culture, A thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy in the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (Art History and Theory) B.A., McGill University, 2004 M.A., McGill University, 2006 The Book of Hours of Philippe of Cleves His earliest known miniature contributions are found in The Book of Hours of Philippe of Cleves (Royal Library of Belgium, Brussels). In the late 1570s or early 1580s, Hoefnagel added in the margins of this 15th century devotional book various illuminations. Some of the themes he developed recur in his later book illuminations, such as the split sour orange or the bright orange Maltese cross. Illumination from the Mira calligraphiae monumenta Roman Missal Between 1581 and 1590, he illustrated the Tridentine version of the Roman missal (now in the National Library in Vienna), a commission for Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria. He added illuminations throughout the missal, which consists of 658 vellum folios. His decorations include nature imagery and grotesque borders. The calendar pages are illuminated with small gaming-boards, instruments and animals linked by strapwork. The images carry emblematic content, typically related to the particular religious text it accompanies or to the patron. Schriftmusterbuch At the request of Emperor Rudolf II Hoefnagel added in the period 1591-1594 miniatures to a manuscript, referred to as Schriftmusterbuch (now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Guide for constructing the letters F and G The Schriftmusterbuch had been created by court calligrapher Georg Bocskay in 1571-1573 for Emperor Maximilian II. The book consists of 127 pages (of which 119 with text) on parchment. Hoefnagel added miniature illuminations to the original text using watercolour and body color in silver with gold highlights, sometimes with traces of silverpoint for the preparatory drawing. Hoefnagel also added eight sheets, which are entirely by his hand.Georg Bocskay and Joris Hoefnagel, Schriftmusterbuch, 1571-1594, Wenen, Kunsthistorisches Museum, inv./cat.nr. 975 at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Hoefnagel used diverse imagery such as flora and fauna, mythology, portraits, city views and battle scenes. The aim was to glorify the Emperor as the supreme terrestrial power and the protector of the Catholic faith. Mira calligraphiae monumenta Hoefnagel was also commissioned by Emperor Rudolf II to illustrate the Mira calligraphiae monumenta (the Model Book of Calligraphy) (now in the Getty Museum). He began the work around 1590, more than 15 years after the death of the calligrapher, Georg Bocskay.Lee Hendrix and Thea Vignau-Wilberg, Nature Illuminated: Flora and Fauna from the Court of the Emperor Rudolf II, Getty Publications, 1997 Like the Musterbuch, this book was originally made by Bocskay to illustrate various calligraphic scripts and also included a constructed alphabet. When the book had come in the possession of Emperor Rudolf II, Hoefnagel added illuminations primarily of plants, fruit and flowers but also included small animals and insects and city views. His illustrations thus provided a survey of the natural world.Acquisitions 1986 in: The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal Volume 15 1987, p. 154 He further illustrated the minuscule letters of the constructed alphabet with hybrid creatures and fanciful masks. Using his extensive resources of pictorial illusionism, Hoefnagel aimed to demonstrate with his illustrations the superior affective power of images over the written word. It thus argued the superiority of one art form over another.Lee Hendrix, Mira calligraphiae monumenta: An Overview, in: Lee Hendrix, Thea Vignau-Wilberg, Mira Calligraphiae Monumenta: A Sixteenth-Century Calligraphic Manuscript Inscribed by Georg Bocksay and Illuminated by Joris Hoefnagel, Volume 1, Getty Publications, 13 Aug 1992, p. 1-6 The book is one of the last important examples of European manuscript illumination, produced at a time when printed books had virtually replaced manuscripts. Hoefnagel's miniature illuminations are regarded as situating themselves in the earlier Flemish miniature tradition and, in particular, the Ghent-Bruges manuscript illuminations of the 15th and 16th century. This is particularly reflected in his meticulous manner of drawing, the use of trompe l’oeil devices (such as cast shadows or stems slipped through fictitious slits in pages) and the naturalistic content. This tradition emphasized illusionism in painting through devices such as three- dimensional modeling of vegetative and other forms and the depiction of details in a precise and life-size manner.Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann and Virginia Roehrig Kaufmann, The Sanctification of Nature: Observations on the Origins of Trompe l'oeil in Netherlandish Book Painting of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Volume 19, 1991, The J. Paul Getty Museum, Getty Publications, 28 Jan 1993, pp. 43-64 Hoefnagel strived to display his virtuosity in his attention for detail as well as his predilection for difficult subjects such as an apple cut in two, a bean pod that is split open or an insect or reptile with iridescent skin.Ernst Kris, Georg Hoefnagel und der wissenschaftliche Naturalismus, in: Ernst Kris, Erstarrte Lebendigkeit, Zwei Untersuchungen, Zürich : Diaphanes, 2012 ===Natural history studies=== Animalia Rationalia et Insecta (Ignis) - Plate I, from the Elementa Depicta, picturing Petrus Gonsalvus. The Four Elements Hoefnagel had chosen 'natura magistra' (nature his teacher) as his motto. It reflects his interest in the realistic depiction of nature. He made a start with his miniature drawings of animals before he left Antwerp. It is on the strength of these early miniatures that he was appointed by the Dukes in Munich. Gradually these natural history were organised into a four-volume manuscript (various folios dated from 1575 to 1582 in various museums including the National Gallery of Art, Washington, the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, the Louvre, Paris and various private collections). The work was entitled Animalia rationalia et insecta (ignis); Animalia quadrupedia et reptilia (terra) ; Animalia aquatilia et conchiliata (aqua); and Animalia volatilia et amphibia (aier) and contains detailed depictions of thousands of animals divided according to the four elements. The book is therefore simply referred to as the Four Elements). The book is made up by about 300 miniatures accompanied by about a thousand inscriptions. The work resembles an emblem book with its Latin mottoes, epigrams and Bible verses. Hoefnagel did not paint all the works but rather copied from other artists' works including a series of drawings by the Antwerp animal painter Hans Verhagen den Stommen and woodcuts from Konrad Gessner's Historia animalium. The book was an important monument of 16th-century science by providing a compendium of the entire known animal world. Archetypa studiaque patris Georgii Hoefnagelii His son Jacob published the Archetypa studiaque patris Georgii Hoefnagelii in 1592 in Frankfurt. The book is a collection of 48 engravings of plants, insects and small animals shown ad vivum made after studies by Joris Hoefnagel.The Archetypa studiaque patris Georgii Hoefnagelii at archive.org It is divided in four parts of twelve plates (each with separate frontispiece) engraved by Jacob Hoefnagel after designs by his father Joris Hoefnagel.Frontispiece at The British Museum The Italian scholar Filippo Buonanni asserted in 1691 that these engravings are the first published instance of the use of the microscope. However, this assertion of Buonanni is still contested.Edward G. Ruestow, The Microscope in the Dutch Republic: The Shaping of Discovery, Cambridge University Press, 22 Jan 2004, p. 70 As the quality of the engravings varies, it is assumed that some of the works were made by members of the family De Bry who resided in Frankfurt.Thea Vignau-Wilberg, Neues zu Jacob Hoefnagel, in: Studia Rudolphina no. 10, 2010, p. 196-211 Flower still life with insects The prints in the collection were intended not solely as representations of the real world. They also carried a religious meaning as they encouraged the contemplation of god's plan of creation. Like contemporary emblem books each print carried a motto typically referring to god's interference in the world. The prints of the book were used as models by other artists and the Hoefnagel motifs were copied until the 19th century. ===Still lifes=== Hoefnagel played an important role in the development of still life, and in particular flower still life, painting as an independent genre. An undated flower piece executed by Hoefnagel in the form of a miniature is the first known independent still life. Hoefnagel enlivened his flower pieces with insects and attention to detail typical of his nature studies. This can be seen in his 1589 Amoris Monumentum Matri Chariss(imae) (ex-Nicolaas Teeuwisse 2008).Joris Hoefnagel, Amoris Monumentum Matri Chariss(imae) at Nicolaas Teeuwisse It has been argued that Hoefnagel's manuscript illuminations, the prints from the Archetypa studiaque and some drawings on vellum independent from any text (such as the 1594 Flower still life with insects, Ashmolean Museum) stood at the basis of still-life painting as an independent genre. This influence is assumed to have been important in particular on the development of the typical Dutch genre of still lifes with flowers, shells and insects. The manner in which Dutch authors and artists represented insects at the beginning of the 17th century was also influenced by Joris Hoefnagel through the intermediary of his sister's marriage into the influential Dutch Huygens family. After his death, a part of his artistic heritage was bequeathed to the Huygens family, where it was seen by Flemish-born Dutch artist Jacob de Gheyn II who would become one of the earliest flower still life painters. ==Notes== ==External links== * *Maps from the Civitates orbis terrarum *Digital Animalia Rationalia et Insecta (1575–1580) at entomologiitaliani *The Four Elements by Joris Hoefnagel at the National Gallery of Art} Category:1542 births Category:1601 deaths Category:Botanical illustrators Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:16th-century engravers Category:Flemish engravers Category:Flemish Mannerist painters Category:Flemish artists (before 1830) Category:Miniature painting ","title":"Joris Hoefnagel"},{"id":"1423535","text":"Alive at the Fucker Club is a live album by Melvins, which was released in 1998 through Amphetamine Reptile Records.

He had three brothers: the eldest, Thomas, joined the 7th Royal Fusiliers, fought at Alma and Inkerman and served through the Indian Mutiny. The second, Henry, passed through Sandhurst before joining the Rifle Brigade, fighting at Alma, Inkerman and Balaclava before being killed in an attack on Russian positions in 1854. George was the third son: the fourth, Richard, also served in the Rifle Brigade. George attended a preparatory school and then Eton College before becoming a naval cadet in 1848, two years older than usual, aged sixteen. The choice of a naval career was made by George himself, rather than his family. Other students reported him to be a quick learner with a wide breadth of knowledge, whether because of his natural ability or his longer period of education before joining the Navy.Fitzgerald p.1113 George was described as 'a tall lanky lad nearly six feet high, full of spirits and fond of a lark'Fitzgerald p.21 Bulwick Park, Northamptonshire, the Tryon family home Naval training at this time took place on board ship, and having obtained a nomination and passing the modest exams, he was posted to HMS Wellesley in spring 1848. Wellesley (Captain George Goldsmith under Admiral the Earl of Dundonald) was then at Plymouth preparing to leave as flagship of the North American Station. She was a two-decker sailing ship, since steam power was only then being introduced into the navy. At that time, the principal important art to be taught to new recruits was how to handle a sailing ship, though within ten years almost all first class naval ships would be steam powered. He was required to pay his own schoolmaster at the rate of £5 per year. In particular, his mathematics at the start of his training was considered very poor, but at examinations eighteen months later, he came top of the class. Wellesley sailed on 24 March, arriving at Bermuda on 3 May. In correspondence home, he observed that he was seasick, and that the gales caused considerable broken crockery aboard ship. Yet while the gunroom (where the midshipman lived) suffered badly from its broken cups of a different pattern to those used elsewhere on the ship, their hens, much alike with others on board, never became ill or died.Fitzgerald pp. 13–16 As a midshipman, Tryon was not an official member of the crew, but a supernumerary, available as spare crew for posting to other ships. He narrowly avoided a posting to Imaum, a hulk lying in Port Royal harbour which needed crew, which would have been a very unpromising start to his career. Although officially posted to that ship, he prevailed upon Lieutenant Cochran (son of Lord Dundonald) to arrange that he would remain on loan to Wellesley. Tryon started to make sketches of the places he visited, which while not very good at the start, improved steadily. In November the ship reached Halifax, where George noted, 'the other day another of our men was murdered here'.Fitzgerald pp. 17–20, quote p. 21 Although Wellesley was a sailing ship, it was accompanied by a paddle-wheel steamer: when the wind failed the steamer would tow the sail ship, when the wind blew well the steamer would be towed to save coal.Fitzgerald p.29 In the summer of 1849, Tryon had the chance of joining a tour of the United States, but declined in favour of study, and to allow him command of a cutter, which was unusual for a junior cadet. In the summer of 1850, he took the tour, visiting Boston, New York, Washington, where they visited the House of Representatives, were introduced to senior politicians and witnessed a debate over California's requested admission to the Union as a free rather than slave state. He commented on the great welcome given to them once it became known that they were English. He also commented on the absence of beggars in the streets.Fitzgerald pp. 24–27 ==Mediterranean fleet== Wellesley returned to Chatham in June 1851. After leave, Tryon was posted to HMS Vengeance, captained by Lord Edward Russell. Vengeance sailed for the Mediterranean in August 1851. The ship was second fastest of the battleships and frigates (after Phaeton), lending considerable prestige to her crew at a time when sailing ability and speed were still considered all important. Admiral William Robert Mends later said of Tryon, 'He served with me, when I was commander of the Vengeance, for two years as a midshipman, and a better young officer never existed; ever full of energy and zeal. As a boat midshipman and signal midshipman he was unrivalled.'Fitzgerald p.33 The ship stopped at Alexandria, and Tryon was given ten days leave to visit Cairo, where the party were received as guests of the Pasha. The party were obliged to stay on as guests, missing the sailing of their ship. The consul advised Captain Russell who then joined the party, which had now transformed into a diplomatic mission promoting British plans for a railway from Alexandria to Cairo. Tryon wrote home, explaining the British desire to create a land route to India, and the continuous vying for power in the region between Britain and France. On a trip to Gibraltar, Tryon and others from the ship joined the local foxhunt in a group of around forty (some in red), riding across the rugged and precipitous terrain on local ponies. Vengeance returned to England in 1852, reaching Spithead on Christmas Day.Fitzgerald pp. 30–38 Sinop Bay after the battle On 10 April 1853 she sailed again for the Mediterranean, arriving at Malta early June to join the Mediterranean fleet under vice- admiral James Dundas. The ship had a new commander, George Le Geyt Bowyear, who reported that Tryon was now signal officer. Considerable competition existed between Vengeance and the fleet flagship in manoeuvres, where Vengeance frequently performed best. Part of Tryon's duties included keeping watch on the flagship before exercises, including going out in a boat at night to see what preparations were being made for the following day.Fitzgerald p.40 The fleet took station in Bashika Bay outside the Dardanelles between June and October, because of the increasing tension with Russia before the Crimean War. In October the fleet moved through the Dardanelles to the Bosphorus and moored at Beikos Bay.Fitzgerald p. 41 On 30 November, the Russian fleet destroyed a squadron of Turkish ships at Sinop, just after Turkey declared war. Britain was not yet at war with Russia, but Vengeance visited Sinop January 1854 and saw the remains of the ships, which had been caught at anchor by the Russians. The British fleet moved into the Black Sea to land troops at Varna and took part in the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April. Cholera broke out through the fleet in August and eighteen died on board Vengeance. The effect varied from ship to ship, with few officers affected: 140 out of 950 died on board the flagship Fitzgerald p.46 The ship assisted with the transportation of the army across the Black Sea to the Crimea before attending at the Battle of Alma on 20 September. Tryon as signal midshipman was stationed at the main top and so had a good view of the battle in which two of his brothers were taking part.Fitzgerald pp. 38–48 Vengeance was once again offshore anchored in Kasatch Bay with Tryon as signals officer watching events during the Battle of Inkerman. After the battle he joined the Naval Brigade in the trenches and was wounded. Captain Stephen Lushington, commanding the Naval Brigade, described him as 'a very promising officer.' Tryon arranged the construction of a hut for himself and two other officers from Vengeance, which uniquely boasted glass windows scrounged from the navy. Tryon passed his seamanship examination on 17 March 1854, at which time he was already acting mate. Having started late, he was anxious to obtain promotion as speedily as possible. Promotion above the rank of captain was on the basis of seniority, so it was important to obtain rapid promotion in the lower ranks. He spent only eight months as mate, then six years as Lieutenant and five and a half years as commander, which was one of the fastest rates of promotion at the time.Fitzgerald pp. 49–50 On 21 October Lieutenant Greathead of Britannia was killed, and in November Tryon was promoted to his position, thereby transferring to Britannia. However, he remained ashore as part of the Naval Brigade.Fitzgerald p. 58 In January 1855 Britannias shore party, together with those from other ships which had been serving together ashore, were all embarked on Vengeance to return to England. Britannia had already departed for England with Admiral Dundas, who had now been replaced as Commander in Chief of the Black Sea fleet by Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons. Tryon took and passed examinations at the Royal naval college Portsmouth and HMS Excellent before returning to a ship. Commander Mends from the Vengeance had now become flag-captain to Admiral Lyons and requested Tryon be appointed to his ship. was a three-decker, steam- powered and brand new. Tryon returned to the Black Sea in June. Tryon now acted as aide-de-camp to the admiral, travelling ashore to report progress in the siege of Sebastopol and later describing the plundering of the town by the victorious armies. He was present at the fall of Kinburn on 17 October 1855, where he was placed in charge of fire-fighting parties. On account of being on duty, he regretfully was unable to liberate any souvenirs for himself. In his letters home he commented on repeated failures by the British and their allies to follow up successes, instead allowing the Russians time to withdraw and regroup.Fitzgerald pp. 61–65 Tryon in 1857, from a miniature by Easton In December 1855 Lyons went to Marseilles to attend the peace conference for the Crimea, leaving his ship to sail to Malta. While in the Aegean Sea the gland surrounding the propellor shaft failed, allowing water to flood into the ship. The bilge pumps could not cope with the flow, but the ship was kept afloat by connecting the cooling water pumps used to condense steam in the engine to the bilge instead of open sea. After use the water was pumped overboard and provided the engine remained running the ship could be kept clear of water. The ship was near the island of Zea, so Captain Mends circled the island through the night until with daylight he was able to beach the ship on a sandy bay. The engines then had to be kept working for four days while a dam was built around the ship to keep out the water and allow repairs to be made. Mends chose Tryon to go to Piraeus to summon help rather than a more senior officer because of his 'marked intelligence'.Fitzgerald pp. 67–70 The remainder of Tryon's time on Royal Albert was largely uneventful. In November 1857 he had an attack of rheumatic fever, requiring him to spend time in hospital in Malta, before being granted leave in Italy to recover. He visited Naples, Rome, Florence and Pompeii, where the volcano was unusually active. When the ship went to Gibraltar he visited Cadiz and Seville. His considerations turned to his career, which risked faltering because he was older than other officers and lacked a patron. However, his good reports meant that his name was submitted to Queen Victoria for consideration for appointment to the royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert. This carried with it automatic promotion to commander after two years' service. Royal Albert returned to England where in July 1858 she acted as part of the escort for Queen Victoria's visit to Cherbourg to meet the Emperor and Empress of France. The queen's yacht entered and departed the harbour between lines of British warships stationed at the approach. Ashore, Tryon came within ten yards of the royal party: the event was celebrated with much firing of guns in salute, fireworks and the lighting up of the ships by lights spread through the rigging and shown at all portholes. Tryon commented that some of the noisiest and most eccentrically dressed attendees were those on the steamer bringing members of the House of Commons.Fitzgerald pp. 71–75 Royal Albert paid off on 24 August 1858 and on 4 November he joined Victoria and Albert. Each year one of the two lieutenants on board would be promoted and replaced. For nine months of the year the yacht had little to do and her officers lived on board the Royal George hulk in Portsmouth harbour. At the end of his two years he duly received promotion, leaving with a commendation from Captain Joseph Denman, 'as an officer of great zeal and promise. His ready resource, active intelligence, sound judgement and good temper, especially qualify him for success in his profession; and I consider it my duty to recommend him strongly to their Lordships as an officer likely to perform any service required of him with ability.'Fitzgerald pp. 76–78 ==Commander (1860–1866)== Tryon was placed on half pay after promotion to commander in October 1860. In June 1861 he was selected to become second in command of HMS Warrior, the world's first ocean- going iron-hulled armoured battleship. Warrior was still under construction, so temporarily he was appointed to Fisguard. Warrior's sister ship was a year later in entering service, but in November 1862 the two ships carried out speed trials, where Warrior was deemed to be the faster. Although the ships' armour was considered impregnable at the time they were constructed, they immediately instigated an arms race between armour and gun designers which continued up to World War II, where each successive ship had to have more of each to remain ahead. This meant that despite her initial claim to invulnerability, she rapidly became obsolete.Fitzgerald p.79–85 In March 1863 Warrior acted as escort for Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who came to Britain to marry the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII). Alexandra was much impressed by the station-keeping of the much larger warship, so much so that her signal to the ship, 'Princess is much pleased,' was inscribed into the ship's wheel. In the autumn the Channel fleet toured ports around the coast of Britain where Warrior was much admired.Fitzgerald pp. 88– In July 1864 Tryon was appointed to command , a 680-ton screw- and sail-propelled gunboat in the Mediterranean. Tryon was given the task of rescuing the British barque Energy, which had run aground on the coast of Sicily seven miles from Pozzallo, and had been abandoned. In two days the ship was refloated and taken back to Malta. Admiral Sir Robert Smart, Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean, recommended Tryon and his crew should receive salvage for the ship, and the sum of £595 was granted to be divided between them. Once again Tryon received a commendation in the Admiral's report. During this time he wrote a report on punishments within the navy, which was forwarded by his commander to the Admiralty. He recommended that fines to sailors absent from duty or incapable should be limited to forfeiting pay for the time they failed to carry out their duties, and this was adopted.Fitzgerald pp. 91–92 In February 1866 Surprise was visiting the Greek island of Santorini, which is part of the rim of a volcano. The ship witnessed clouds of steam and explosions as a new island 100 yards long and 50 wide had just begun to appear from the seabed a few days earlier. The eruption completely filled a channel through Santorini and then began to encroach on houses on the land. Surprise visited a number of ports around the Mediterranean, reporting on their facilities for the Admiralty. An issue arose as to whether the Admiralty should retain control of warehouses at Gibraltar, which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be vitally important to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He was one of the few at that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet. Surprise returned to England to pay off at Plymouth Sound in April 1866. On arrival, Tryon found waiting his promotion to post-captain on 11 April 1866, which he had achieved by the comparatively early age of 34.Fitzgerald pp. 93–98 ==Captain (1866–1884)== Tryon now spent eighteen months away from ships. Aside from time on half pay on leave, he attended the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth to study steam technology. In August 1867 while touring Norway on a fishing expedition, he received a recall and appointment as 'additional captain' to . Octavia was the flagship of the East India Station commanded by Commodore Leopold Heath. Tryon was attached to Octavia, but his duties were to act as transport officer at Annesley Bay, which was to be used as a staging post for troops and supplies for Sir Robert Napier's expedition to Magdala in Abyssinia. Tryon arrived in Bombay on 10 October 1867 where preparations were already underway. 291 transport ships were chartered, mainly from Bombay but some coming from England via the Cape of Good Hope. The advance party went to Zoulla in Annesley Bay in November, described as one of the hottest places on earth. The expedition delivered a fighting force of 4,000 men to Magdala out of total 13,000 soldiers and 60,000 people involved all together. 36,000 animals, mainly for transport, had to be taken to Zoulla. There was no drinking water, so 30,000 tons had to be distilled by the ships' steam engines using 8,000 tons of coal in the process, with ships held at anchor with their engines running. Tryon's duties involved early morning meetings ashore with military authorities, days spent unloading and organising ships, and evenings spent in preparation for the next. Tryon was commended for his organisational skills and tact in dealing with all the disparate parties and complaining ships' captains. Approximately half his staff was invalided out because of the heat during the six months' stay, with the rest all suffering. When he left he was presented with a scroll recording the appreciation of his efforts by the captains of the transport fleet, and later in England was presented with a specially commissioned dinner service decorated with scenes commemorating the campaign.Fitzgerald pp. 99–117 He was awarded the CB for his services in Abyssinia.Fitzgerald p. 244 Although he continued working as hard as ever throughout the campaign, Tryon's health suffered. He injured his leg while fighting a fire on board one of the ships, and on returning to England, at first could not walk a modest distance without resting. In April 1869 he married Clementina Heathcote, and had time away from the navy for the next two years. Clementina was the daughter of Gilbert Heathcote (later Baron Aveland) who was a neighbour of the Tryon's and had been a friend since childhood. Their honeymoon was spent at Bulby Hall, home of Clementina's brother, the Earl of Ancaster. They then travelled in Europe for three months before renting Tickhill Castle near Doncaster.Fitzgerald pp. 117–120 In April 1871, Tryon was appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Goschen. The appointment normally went to an experienced captain with ten years' service, whereas Tryon had yet to serve at sea in that rank. The post carried considerable influence, equivalent in practice to that of other Lords of the Admiralty, in advising upon naval appointments. Goschen said of Tryon, \\"I had an immensely high opinion not only of his naval knowledge, but of his general savoir faire, rapidity of judgement, decision, extraordinary shrewdness, and great knowledge of men. He was somewhat cynical in his views of human nature but his cynicism was of a good humoured and harmless cast.\\"Fitzgerald pp. 121–122 A story was related of the Admiralty board travelling to Dover to meet the Shah of Persia in 1872. At the railway station it was found they would have to walk some distance through a large crowd. Tryon commented to a friend that he would get one of the admirals to carry his bag for him, which he duly did by asking the admiral to hold his bag while he opened a way through the crowd. Tryon then avoided reclaiming his luggage until they reached their destination.Fitzgerald pp. 125–126 ===HMS Raleigh=== and Tryon left the Admiralty to take up command of , a new ship under construction. He was attached to the depot ship about a month before, until Raleigh was commissioned on 13 January 1874. Tryon took the opportunity to suggest improvements to her final fitting out. After a cruise of Ireland she was attached to the 'Flying Squadron' commanded by Rear Admiral Sir George Granville Randolph. Raleigh proved to be the fastest of the six ships under steam, but still also the second fastest under sail alone, after Immortalite. The squadron set out on a tour to Gibraltar, then South America where, at the Falkland Islands, officers from the ships hired a schooner to tour around and organised hunting parties across the island. Next they went to South Africa, arriving at the Cape of Good Hope on 6 March 1875. There Raleigh took on board Sir Garnet Wolesley and his staff to transport them to Natal. The remainder of the squadron returned to the Mediterranean, where Raleigh joined them later. At Gibraltar, Randolph was replaced by Rear Admiral Rowley Lambert, and the whole squadron was ordered to go to Bombay, to attend the Prince of Wales who would shortly be making a tour of India.Fitzgerald pp. 128–138 Tryon showed concern for the wellbeing of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more took the opportunity to escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a memo to the Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but who had some urgent personal reason for absconding, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.Fitzgerald pp. 133–134, 137–138 Travelling to the cape, a man fell overboard in high seas. Tryon had to make the difficult decision whether to try to rescue him, because any small boat risked sinking, taking her crew down also. However, the man was seen to be swimming strongly, so the ship was halted and a boat launched to rescue him. The boat got away well, though was sucked back under the stern of the ship before breaking free. The ship then had to manoeuvre under sail, tacking as best she could to follow the boat while keeping it on the safe side for recovery. All went well, and Tryon received congratulations from the other captains for his skill in carrying out the rescue.Fitzgerald pp. 139–141 The squadron arrived in Bombay shortly before the Prince, who was travelling on and , and a number of grand events took place. On one evening a dinner was arranged for the Prince in the Caves of Elephanta, on an island near Bombay. The ships were arranged around the approach with illuminations and fireworks brought from England. As the Prince's ship approached, rockets were set off, one or two hundred at a time. One of Raleighs sails caught fire, but preparations had been made in anticipation that something would catch fire in the rigging, and it was soon put out. As Raleigh was the only ship fast enough to keep up with Serapis and Osborne, Tryon then accompanied the royal progress to Goa, Bepore, and Colombo, where the party disembarked for a tour of Ceylon. Raleigh was required to accommodate all the newspaper correspondents who wished to accompany the Prince. The royal party rejoined at Madras to travel to Calcutta, where Raleigh had to leave the party, being too big to navigate the Hooghly. Raleigh rejoined once more at Bombay for the return trip to England via the Suez canal, setting out on 13 March 1876. Now she was required to accommodate gifts given to the Prince, including two tigers, a leopard, a number of birds and smaller animals, which occupied the space previously taken by the journalists. The remainder of the Flying Squadron left for China. The royal party arrived at Portsmouth on 11 May and were met at The Needles by the Princess of Wales. The whole party proceeded through the Solent with an elephant standing on each of the paddleboxes on Osborne.Fitzgerald p.142 -146 Raleigh was refitted and sent to join the Mediterranean squadron, where tension was once again rising with Turkey and Russia. In autumn 1876 Tryon was at Bashika Bay, where he had been twenty-two years before. He noted the improved health of the sailors this time, which he ascribed to the fact that fresh water was now produced on board ship rather than having to be brought aboard. The political tension came to nothing, and the tour was highlighted by escort duty to the Duchess of Edinburgh aboard the Russian Imperial yacht, hunting trips and visits to places of interest. In June 1877 Tryon was replaced by Captain Jago as commander of Raleigh after a tour of three and a half years and returned home.Fitzgerald pp. 146–151 ===Committee to revise the Signal Book=== From June 1877 to October 1878, Tryon remained in England. In January 1878 he was appointed to a committee set up to revise the general signal book. President of the committee was Rear Admiral Hope, other members were Captain Philip Colomb, Captain Walter Kerr, Commanders Bruce and Romilly. Colomb and Tryon represented divergent views on signalling, but all members of the committee were experts in the field while Kerr and Hope held the balance.Fitzgerald pp. 154–156 ===HMS Monarch 1878=== On 1 October 1878, Tryon was appointed to of the Mediterranean fleet under Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, joining her at Artaki in the Sea of Marmora on 18 November. The British were concerned to protect the Bulair peninsula from Russian advances and had stationed ships at Gallipoli and in the Gulf of Xeros so as to have artillery commanding possible approaches. The main part of the British fleet stayed in the eastern part of the Sea of Marmora during the crisis.Fitzgerald pp. 156–157 Tryon was required to sit on the court of enquiry into the explosion of a 12-inch (305 mm) gun on board . On 2 January 1879 while carrying out target practice in the Gulf of Ismid, one of the guns burst, killing seven men and injuring thirty-six. This was of considerable concern since similar guns were used by many ships. It was eventually concluded that the muzzle-loading gun had been double loaded, which produced exactly the same result when tested on another gun. In the summer of 1879 Monarch cruised the Levant, visiting various places where Tryon would land, both for pleasure but also seeking useful information. Britain had just acquired Cyprus, which it was intended to develop into a base for 10,000 troops and a resort, but of which Tryon was skeptical because of its poor climate and lack of a good harbour. In his travels he discovered deposits of coal at Ayas in the Gulf of Scanderoon, and was responsible for organising the transport of marble statues from Aleppo for the British Museum. In March 1880 Hornby was replaced as commander of the fleet by Admiral Sir Beauchamp Seymour, who in the summer sent Monarch and Thunderer to attend the launching of the battleship by the King of Italy at Naples. Tryon was commended by the king for his handling of the British ships.Fitzgerald pp. 157–164 In May 1881 Tryon was sent as senior officer with a group of ships to patrol the coast of Tunisia. Although there was no war, France was concerned about events in Tunisia, and the French gunboat Leopold searched two British schooners looking for gunpowder. This was a breach of international law and might have escalated into a serious incident, but Tryon handled the matter with tact. He suggested to the senior French officer, Captain Rieunnier, that perhaps a mistake had been made. The French apologised and explained that the commander of Leopold had misunderstood his instructions.Fitzgerald pp. 164–165 A more serious incident took place when the region of Sfax in Tunisia rose in revolt against French intervention. The revolt was started by a local artillery commander, who was called upon to produce his troops in support of the French, but in fact despite receiving pay for the men, had none. To divert attention, he organised a local demonstration against the French. This led to other foreign nationals fleeing the region, although it was only the French who were affected. Local Bedawin then took up the revolt which grew out of control, although order and respect for foreign property in the town was maintained by a local leader, Camoum. The French sent ships and then a fleet to bombard the town, and eventually troops which landed to occupy it on 16 July. After order was restored, the French set up a commission of enquiry to investigate claims for damages and invited the British and Italians each to appoint a representative. Tryon was chosen to represent the British on the commission which first met 29 August. The Commission sat for six weeks, by which time the evidence submitted already indicated strongly that damage to property and looting had been carried out by the French troops, at which point the commission was suddenly dissolved. The British official position was one of neutrality, and in effect allowing the French to do what they wanted. This placed Tryon in a delicate position that while he confirmed the views of locals that the French had caused much of the problems and intended to take control of the region, Britain would do nothing to intervene. He was instructed to send reports directly to the Admiralty and foreign office, rather than to his commander, Admiral Seymour. Monarch spent much of a six-month period at anchor off Tunisia in temperatures of 80–90 degrees Fahrenheit, without any leave being permitted, which made the task an uncomfortable one for all concerned. Although the warship was not required, the Foreign office specifically requested that Tryon should remain for as long as possible.Fitzgerald pp. 165–179 Tryon was commended for his handling of the affair by Earl Granville from the foreign office, the Lords of the Admiralty, and by the French Government.Fitzgerald pp. 179–185 Monarch was paid off at Malta in January 1882, and the crew returned to England on board Tamar.Fitzgerald p. 183 ===Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty (1882)=== Tryon had four months leave before being appointed Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. This post, in charge of a civilian staff, was sometimes given to serving officers and sometimes civilians. Tryon demonstrated great powers of persuasion and an ability to get his way in an argument without offending. His appointment was initially temporary, following the sudden death of the previous appointee, but he proved a great success. One of his most significant contributions was in advancing proposals for the creation of a naval intelligence committee, whose duties would be to collect together all available intelligence both from naval officers and from the army intelligence department. Those first appointed to the committee were Mr Hoste from the civilian establishment and Commander William Hall.Fitzgerald pp. 186–193 The role of Permanent Secretary included many invitations to social engagements, receptions banquets and dinners. Tryon's guiding rule in choosing which invitations to accept was to seek out people who might have useful information. He stated that he learnt something from everybody.Fitzgerald pp. 195–220 ==Rear Admiral Australian Station (1884)== In 1884 Tryon was promoted to rear admiral and placed in command of the Australian Station. He left England on 4 December 1884 on board the P&O; steamer Indus, arriving on board his new flagship in Sydney 22 January 1885. The growing importance of the Australian colonies (at that time separate colonies under the crown rather than united under one Australian government) meant that the squadron was becoming more important also, so now an admiral was appointed to replace the previous commander, Commodore James Erskine. Tryon's political and social skills were considered important for the role, which involved negotiations with the Australian colonies for financing a fast cruiser squadron in the region.Fitzgerald pp. 196–198 Conflicting interests also existed within Australia, particularly in the northern colony of Queensland, where plantation owners sought to expand their holdings on the northern coastlands using imported cheap native labour. Local 'white' labourers objected to this as it undercut their wages and prospects, and the government also had some objections, preferring to establish a pattern of smaller farms operated by resident owners, rather than absentee landlords creating vast estates. Part of the squadron's duties included patrolling the waters between Queensland and the islands of New Guinea to prevent kidnapping and human trafficking of native labourers to supply new plantations. The South East corner of New Guinea around Port Moresby had only been annexed as a British protectorate the previous year (1884) by Commodore Erskine on behalf of Queen Victoria. The Germans had similarly claimed an area in the north-east corner of the island, and France was using New Caledonia as a penal colony. The convicts would from time to time escape to Australia where they would cause difficulties.Fitzgerald pp. 199–206 In spring 1885 tension had been growing between Britain and Russia because of the Penjdeh incident in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, which could not be prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the Admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence might best be achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even if this had not in reality been entirely achieved.Fitzgerald pp. 206–227 An initial proposal was made by Tryon for a squadron of six -class ships of 1,800 tons armed with 6-in guns capable of 16 knots costing around £105,000 each, accompanied by eight 150-ton torpedo boats priced around £53,000. However, at this time the French commenced a construction programme for 19-knot cruisers, so the plans were revised. Eventually five 2,500-ton cruisers capable of 19 knots designed by Sir William Henry White were constructed in England and sent to the Australian squadron. A conference of colonial delegates was held in London in 1887 to discuss Australian defence, to which Tryon was not invited despite the large part he had played thus far in negotiations on behalf of the Admiralty and British government. His exclusion from the conference prompted him to request to be relieved from the Australian command after two years rather than the normal term of three.Fitzgerald pp. 228–231 Tryon as admiral was provided with a house by the New South Wales government on the north shore of Sydney Harbour, near the navy anchorages. This was undergoing refurbishment at the time he took command but, once installed, his time as admiral was well remembered for the programme of social engagements and hospitality given to Sydney society as part of his duties. He took an interest in furthering development of the supply depot and repair dock in Sydney Harbour, and the construction of a new sailors' home to replace an existing one which had become overtaken by demand. Partly because of the unfinished accommodation, and the war scare, his wife did not accompany him to Australia.Fitzgerald pp. 231–234 Much of Tryon's time was spent in Sydney, but he visited Victoria, Queensland and twice visited New Zealand in the summers (southern hemisphere) of 1885–86 and 1886–87. On the first visit he attempted to reassure ministers that their defence was better served by one combined squadron rather than dispersed ships, even if some were posted there. He also visited the beautiful hot lakes and terraces of the volcanic region, shortly before it was wiped back to blackened ash by an earthquake and eruption.Penrose pp. 235–238 In April 1887 he handed command of the squadron to Rear Admiral Henry Fairfax before travelling to Melbourne and thence by P&O; steamer Ballarat to England. He was commended and thanked by the lords of the Admiralty for his efforts in encouraging adoption of a combined defensive position by the Australian colonies, and contributed in some part to encouraging the states to work increasingly closer together and move towards unification. Shortly after returning home he was awarded the KCB for his services in Australia in the Jubilee honours list.Fitzgerald pp. 239–243 ==Parliamentary candidate 1887== Tryon stood for parliament in a by- election held on 1 July 1887 in the Spalding division of Lincolnshire. He was hampered in the campaign by having only reached England on 5 June and the constituency on the 14th, and by an injured leg acquired during the voyage requiring him to walk with a stick. He stood on a platform of maintaining the union of Britain with Ireland, which mirrored his own views from his Australian experience that the colonies there should unite. It was his intention also to speak on colonial issues in the House once elected. He was aided by unionists from northern Ireland who came to plead their cause, but opposed by a local candidate who had had two years to become known and had his own supporting Parnellites from Ireland to tell their own stories. At the time there was a considerable depression in agriculture, and this was the deciding issue in this rural constituency. Farmers sided with Tryon and the unionist government, while their workers who had suffered pay cuts and lost jobs, causing many to emigrate or move away splitting up families, sided with his Liberal opponent, Halley Stewart.Fitzgerald pp. 244–249The Times, 18 June 1887, issue 32102, p. 12 Halley Stewart received 5110 votes against Tryon's 4363. At the previous election in 1886 Stewart had lost by 288 votes. It was considered that Tryon's lack of agricultural background had counted against him.The Times, 4 July 1887, issue 32115 p. 6 From June 1887 to April 1888 Tryon remained on half pay enjoying time with his family. He suffered a broken arm in a fall from a stable attic while visiting his mother in law, Lady Willoughby de Eresby at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire. Tryon showed considerable regard for his mother in law, who died not long afterwards in November 1888.Fitzgerald pp. 251–252 ==Admiral Superintendent of Reserves 1888== In April 1888 Tryon was appointed Admiral Superintendent of Reserves, which included the coastguard service, and became chairman of a committee on coastguard buildings. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 15 August 1889. In 1891 Tryon chaired a committee on naval reserves, where he expressed his views on the importance of cooperation between merchant shipping and the navy in times of war.Fitzgerald pp. 252–254 The committee consisted of Allen Young, C. Rivers Wilson, Thomas Ismay, and two or three naval officers. The committee noted that although traditionally the merchant navy was looked upon as a pool of trained sailors which could be called upon in wartime, the proportion of non-British sailors in British ships was steadily increasing. Moreover, that modern warships were becoming increasingly different from merchant ships, so it was felt a man could not simply be called from a merchantman and placed into a naval ship. A system of reserves was required where men received training and a retainer fee to be ready for war service when needed. Tryon felt it important that men from the reserve should wear the same uniform as regular sailors, so that no sense of inferiority might attach to them. Tryon had been impressed by the quality of merchant sailors serving in the Naval Brigade in Crimea.Fitzgerald pp. 274–281 Tryon was consulted on the best design for new battleships following the naval defence act of 1889, which had authorised seventy new ships including ten battleships. Tryon favoured a high freeboard to allow ships to perform well in rough seas, guns at least twenty- three feet above the waterline, and a minimum length of 380 feet. He opposed the very large 100-ton guns which had become available at that time, preferring smaller guns of around 45 tons. This proved a correct choice, as the 100-ton guns which did enter service proved unsuccessful. Their introduction had been experimental and in part in reaction to other navies trying such guns.Fitzgerald pp. 281–283 ===1888 naval manoeuvres, 'Achill admiral'=== In 1885 a programme of annual naval manoeuvres had begun, where the British navy would divide into opposing fleets and conduct war exercises as near as possible to real conditions which might be experienced. By 1888 this had become a source of great interest to the public and the navy alike. The navy encouraged attention, allowing reporters on board during manoeuvres, believing that the publicity furthered their campaigns for greater funding.Hough pp. 15–16 That year, the intention was to test the practicality of blockading an enemy fleet in its home ports when the ships concerned were modern iron and steam vessels rather than traditional sailing ships. The idea was that a superior fleet, taking the role of the British, would surprise an inferior enemy force before it could sail from two home ports. Tryon commanded the 'Achill' fleet based in Berehaven in Bantry Bay on the south-west coast of Ireland and Lough Swilly on the north coast. Tryon chose the nickname 'Achill admiral' for himself, from the name of a small island midway between the two bases. All Irish territory was considered friendly to 'Achill', and hostile to their opponents. The 'Achill' fleet consisted of 19 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats. The major warships were as follows: *Ironclads: , , , , , , , , and . *Unarmoured ships: , , , , , , , , , and . Opposing was Vice Admiral John K.E. Baird, whose force of 26 major warships and 12 first class torpedo boats represented the British fleet. England, Scotland and Wales were considered friendly to the 'British' fleet and hostile to 'Achill'. Baird's major warships consisted of: *Ironclads: , , , , , , , , , , , and . *Unarmoured ships: , , , , , , , , , , , and . Hostilities commenced on 24 July. Tryon was of the view at the outset that there was little he could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness. They had to continuously maintain station outside his ports, while he and his men enjoyed the Irish countryside. They suffered the difficulties of communicating while at sea whereas Tryon could simply use the telegraph. Albert Markham commanded the blockader's squadron of cruisers, whose job was to stay close to Berehaven, watch for ship movements and attack anyone who emerged, while the ironclads stayed further away.Hough p.12 On the first day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and a battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For the next two days he did nothing, except fire occasional shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries if they came too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing no lights with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30 pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, Warspite, Iris, Severn, Volage, Cossack and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance, staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the Hercules was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around and headed back to port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that, too late, one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.Hough pp. 17–18 Admiral Fitzroy at Lough Swilley with Rodney and two other ships also broke the blockade on 4 August, joining Tryon's ships which had escaped. Baird, on discovering the breakout, had no choice but to break off the failed blockade. He sent his deputy Admiral Rowley to guard Liverpool, while himself proceeding to coal at Portland, ready to defend the Thames and London. Fitzroy took his ships north around Scotland, 'destroying' Aberdeen, Grimsby, Newcastle and the ships berthed there, before returning to Lough Swilley. Meanwhile, Tryon, no longer blockaded at Berehaven, took his slower ships to Lough Swilley, where they joined the similar slow ships from Fitzroy's command, before proceeding to attack Liverpool. He claimed Belleisle, which had been guarding the port, as captured, and 'destroyed' the shipping there. Baird regrouped his forces to defend London, leaving Tryon in command of the English Channel and most of the rest of the British coast.The New York Times, 2 July 1893, Tryon's brilliant tactics; dazing his opponents in the manoeuvres of 1888Fitzgerald pp. 259–260 Tryon was criticised by officers from the enemy fleet that he had not given due warning to merchant vessels before attacking, nor allowed their crews time to escape as required under international law. He had bombarded defenceless cities and 'killed' civilians, and it was claimed he used false flags and captured signalling equipment. He was praised by the Admiralty for his handling of the fleet, but his opponents in turn felt criticised for their failings. The public felt comforted that such an officer was really on the British side.Hough pp. 20–22 The conclusion drawn from the exercise was the serious danger posed by even a small force of fast ships, and the need for considerably greater forces than those available in the exercise to successfully impose a blockade. The official report of events was prepared by Admirals Sir William Dowell, Sir Vesey Hamilton and Sir Frederick Richards. They stressed the importance to Britain of an effective navy to protect its waters and the much greater importance of this to the country as a whole than the army. If control of the seas around Britain could be maintained, then no army was needed to defend it. Whereas, if control was lost then no army however great would suffice to defend it, because it must starve deprived of shipping. This contributed to the adoption of the principle that the British navy must equal the combined force of the other two greatest world navies.Fitzgerald pp. 260–262 Shortly after the manoeuvres, Tryon wrote a fictional history of the 'Achill' campaign, describing the opening events of the war against a foreign naval power which had just been played out in the exercise, then going on with an account of what happened next. This incorporated and publicised many of his own views about how national defence should be conducted, without mentioning any real countries which might take offence.Fitzgerald pp. 283–294 ===1889 naval manoeuvres=== The manoeuvres of 1889 were similar to the previous year, with an enemy fleet based at Queenstown and Berehaven, but this time Baird commanded the 'enemy' fleet and Tryon the 'British'. Baird's task was to launch raids against Britain, and while Tryon would not attempt to blockade his enemy in port, it was his task to prevent the raiding. Both admirals had slow flagships, while their seconds-in-command, Tracey for Tryon's fleet and D'Arcy Irvine for Baird, had fast ships. Tryon's headquarters was at Milford Haven but he moved to Falmouth during the exercise.Fitzgerald pp. 263–264 Baird attempted to send his fast battleships by different routes to regroup off Dover and then attack the Thames. Tryon succeeded in intercepting him, and was deemed to capture Camperdown, Immortalite and Hero. Tryon also managed to seal up Baird's slower ships in Queenstown. After the abortive attack on London, D'Arcy-Irvine with Anson and Collingwood was sent to raid the north of Scotland where he ransomed Aberdeen and Edinburgh. He was now joined by the slower but powerful Inflexible and proceeded down the east coast of Britain, bombarding Newcastle and Sunderland. On the day before the exercise was to end they moved on to Scarborough, but were surprised in hazy weather by Tracey with Rodney, Howe, Ajax and three cruisers. D'Arcy Irvine was obliged to retreat, but the slow Inflexible was surrounded and captured. Collingwood was caught next, but D'Arcy-Irvine managed to escape with Anson.Fitzgerald pp. 264–266 The four umpires (Admirals Bowden-Smith and Morant accompanying Baird, Lord Charles Scott and Sir R. Molyneux with Tryon) found that Tryon had succeeded in his objective as well as might be done with the inadequate ships at his disposal, but that had the exercise continued his capture of enemy ships would have given him an advantage. Baird's raid on the Thames had failed, but with six fast cruisers he had managed to capture ninety-five merchant ships around the British coast. The cruisers had been chased by Tryon's ships several times, but were able to run and continue elsewhere.Fitzgerald pp. 266–267 ===1890 naval manoeuvres=== Tryon and Tracey commanded a 'British' fleet a little larger than their enemy commanded by Sir Michael Seymour and Admiral Robinson. Seymour's task was to remain at sea interfering with British trade but avoiding action, while Tryon was to attempt to chase him down. Seymour was given 24 hours start from Berehaven before Tryon was allowed to sail from English ports, although Tryon was allowed to use cruisers to scout his movements. Obtaining supplies of coal for the ships was the limiting factor, and Seymour overcame this difficulty by arranging colliers to meet his fleet at sea. Thus he picked a spot off the trade routes he wished to attack, and stayed there. Tryon succeeded in defending the Channel, but could not prevent Seymour intercepting merchant ships 300 miles away at sea.Fitzgerald pp. 267–269 Tryon commented that although this year's exercises were on the face of it the least exciting, they had still been the most useful of the three. The exercises were not without critics as to whether they accurately represented real war situations. A number of captains were criticised for not taking the rules sufficiently seriously, continuing to fight their ships after they should have considered themselves sunk or captured. Vice-Admiral Batsch of the German navy published a critique of the '88 and '89 exercises, arguing that the objectives of the admirals had become reversed from those of a real war, where coastal raids would follow opportunistically to main fleet engagements, rather than being main aims in themselves. In the '89 exercise the enemy fleet started at a 25% disadvantage, but steady attrition during raiding reduced it to 43% the size of the British fleet, so that any chance of a decisive victory steadily diminished. The result of dividing forces had been that they were picked off one by one. Nevertheless, the exercises served to improve morale for the sailors concerned, and to raise considerable interest amongst the general public in naval affairs.Fitzgerald pp. 269–273 ===Wartime Marine Insurance=== Tryon became a strong supporter of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.Fitzgerald pp. 295–301 Tryon claimed that he had first heard of the idea from Admiral Hopkins. Having become convinced of its importance he wrote an article explaining the idea in the 'United Service Magazine' of May 1890 as well as having pamphlets printed which he distributed to those likely to be interested. The idea gave rise to an immense amount of discussion nationally. The Times came out against the idea of government intervention in commerce, arguing the important issue was not who paid for sunk ships, but having a navy capable of preventing them being sunk. It argued that the scheme was a diversion from this main objective and would simply provide a false sense of security.The Times, 5 September 1890 Many smaller papers took the same line, as did a number of naval officers including Lord Charles Beresford. Their concern was chiefly that a government might see the scheme as an alternative to a larger navy.Fitzgerald pp. 296–302 Tryon responded in a letter to The Times on 19 September arguing the need for the scheme whatever the size of the navy. The Chairman of P&O;, Sir Thomas Sutherland, wrote arguing that a scheme ought to be considered and prepared in peace time, but no legislation should be passed or anything else done unless an actual war situation arose. When it did, it might turn out that insurance would be available privately or that shipowners might benefit from higher wartime profits. He questioned whether any amount of compensation would convince owners to send ships if they expected them to be lost. Sir Arthur Forwood (shipowner and later parliamentary secretary to the Admiralty) wrote observing that during the American war of Independence shipowners had responded to the initial insurance rate of 20% by building better ships and choosing their routes carefully, with the results that the best blockade runners could then obtain lower premiums. He added that they bought cotton at 2d, and sold it at 2s, a 1000% profit if they succeeded. Retired admiral Alfred Chatfield, then a city businessman, observed that the scheme would disproportionately favour smaller and slower ships at the greatest risk of enemy capture, perhaps even making them more profitable and thus discouraging the construction of safer but more expensive replacements. Others, such as Thomas Ismay of the White Star line were in favour of the plan, arguing it would prevent many ships simply being laid up in safety for the duration of hostilities, and suggesting that many who were relying on flying under a neutral flag which theoretically guaranteed safety, were liable for a nasty surprise. Tryon himself argued that the scheme might only be needed at the onset of hostility until shippers had become accustomed to the safest ways of maintaining trade.Fitzgerald pp. 303–312 ==C-in-C Mediterranean Fleet 1891== Grand Harbour, Malta, home of the British Mediterranean Fleet In August 1891 Tryon was appointed to command the Mediterranean station, the most powerful force within the Royal Navy at that time. The Mediterranean was recognised as the sea area then of greatest importance to Britain. Tryon left England on 11 September on board HMS Nile meeting the first division of the fleet under its previous commander, vice admiral Sir Anthony Hoskins, on board the flagship HMS Victoria at Gibraltar. Tryon assumed command on 21 September. The division toured Port Mahon, Madelena, Naples, Malta, Nauplia and Milo, where they were joined by the second division under rear-admiral Lord Walter Kerr. The fleet then exercised until November, when they again divided: the first division wintering at Malta while the second remained in the Levant.Fitzgerald pp. 313–314 Each year the fleet held a regatta where officers and men from different ships competed against each other, training for months in advance. It was customary for the admiral to provide a cup to be presented to the winner of a sailing race between bona fide service boats of all types. In November 1891 the regatta took place at Suda Bay and the winner of 'the admiral's cup' from 60 boats was Lieutenant Evan-Thomas. The race was initially instituted by admiral Phipps Hornby in 1872 with the intention of encouraging skill in sailing, which was becoming a sideline in a steam powered navy.Fitzgerald pp. 326–328 One of Tryon's first actions as commander was to write a memorandum to all commanders requesting that they draw to his attention anything which might concern the fleet or British interests which they might discover but which in the ordinary way they would not pass on.Fitzgerald p.320 After the grounding of in 1892 he circulated a memorandum to the fleet concerning safe manoeuvring of ships, particularly in difficult circumstances. Of particular relevance to later events, the memorandum warned commanders that their first duty was always to safeguard their ship (at least, during times of peace) and that should they ever be faced with an order which for some reason might be dangerous, then they should attempt to carry out the intention of the order, but only if it could be done without risk to their ship or others.Fitzgerald pp. 323–325 As at other stations, the commander of the fleet was provided with a residence and expected to entertain society. The admiral's house in the Strada Mezzodi was one of the smaller auberges, originally palaces for the Knights of St. John. The small size was a disadvantage for the lavish parties which Tryon and his wife were expected to host, but the parties held in the winters of 1891–92 and 1892–93 were very popular. The admiral was the second most important person on the island, after the Governor. The admiral's other duties, aside from running the fleet, included corresponding with the director of Naval Intelligence, Captain Cyprian Bridge, passing on and receiving intelligence reports. This required replying personally to information received from his officers: he was described as a fast writer but with difficult handwriting. The correspondence covered everything from problems the Italian were having with their carrier pigeons to details of international law.Fitzgerald pp. 328–333 ===TA, manoeuvres without signals=== Admiral Tryon was concerned that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter- flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement.Fitzgerald pp. 350–354 This was a radical departure from contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it \\"unsound in theory and perilous in practice\\", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that \\"the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war\\". ===Grounding of HMS Victoria=== HMS Victoria, flagship of the Mediterranean fleet, was in retrospect an unlucky ship. In January 1892 she was at Platea in Greece carrying out exercises firing torpedoes, when she ran aground on Snipe Point. Tryon was not on board, as the fleet ships went individually for torpedo practice. This involved firing torpedoes while travelling at speed, but was made more difficult by the need to conduct the practices in shallow waters so the torpedoes could be recovered. Captain Bourke had sent men to mark the point where the waters shallowed to ten fathoms, but they had misjudged the buoy's proper position. Victoria ran aground at nine knots, leaving the fore end of the ship seven feet higher out of the water than normal, while the stern still had 66 feet of water beneath it. The ship was secured with anchors and unsuccessful attempts were made by the nearby torpedo-depot ship to tow her free. Tryon arrived from Malta on board the Surprise, having given orders for the dockyard tug Sampson, Phaeton, Edinburgh, Dreadnought, Scout and Humber to come to assist. Victoria was refloated six days after grounding, towed by Dreadnought and Edinburgh, with the tug lashed to her side and her own engines running astern. 1200 tons had been removed from the ship to lighten her. Victoria returned to Malta for repairs to torn plates along her bottom.Fitzgerald pp. 333–338 Victoria was repaired in time for the fleet summer cruise in May. The first division sailed from Malta on 31 May for Nauplia, where they were joined by the second division commanded by rear-admiral Markham. The entire fleet then exercised in the Aegean Sea. In June Tryon visited the Sultan of Turkey in Constantinople. Warships were not permitted in the Dardanelles, so the party went on the admiral's steam yacht, Surprise. Captains Bourke from Victoria, Noel from Nile and Wilson from Sans Pareil accompanied Tryon, who received the Medjidie of the first class from the Sultan. They rejoined the fleet at Vourlah Bay on 25 June. In July the fleet divided, with the second division going to the Levant while Tryon and the first division went to Sicily, where the volcano Mount Etna was erupting. The tour continued around Italian and Spanish ports with a fortnight at Gibraltar, before returning to Malta on 29 September. On 10 October once again they set out to Nauplia to meet the second division.Fitzgerald pp. 338–340 The annual regatta pulling races were held at Salonica, and the sailing races at Lemnos. An additional prize was presented by the Vali of Salonica to the winners of the all-comers race. Tryon directed that the junior midshipman should accept the prize for the winners, on the grounds that he would most likely live longest to remember the event. The sailing events took place at Moudros Bay, a large expanse of water largely surrounded by low-lying land providing good sailing conditions, and plenty of opportunity for officers to go ashore and hunt local game. On this occasion the admiral's cup was won by Commander Tate of the Colossus. The two divisions now separated again, the first with Tryon returning to Malta for the winter.Fitzgerald pp. 340–342 ===Sinking of HMS Victoria and drowning of Vice- Admiral Tryon=== On 22 June 1893, the fleet was on exercises when Tryon's flagship, HMS Victoria, sank following a bizarre order from him which brought it in collision with the flagship of his second-in-command, Rear Admiral Sir Albert Markham. Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being \\"It is all my fault\\". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer, but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in Society Journal Talk in July 1893 (following the accident) said, \\"Much has been said about George Tryon's charm of manner, and the rest of it, but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man. Unfortunately he was a 'viewy' man too, a man of theories...\\"Gordon p. 194. ==His son== Tryon's son was the Conservative politician, George Tryon, 1st Baron Tryon. ==See also== * Battle of Sinop * British Mediterranean Fleet ==References== == Bibliography == *Andrew Gordon, The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command, John Murray, London, 1996. *Richard Hough, Admirals in Collision, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, London, 1959. *Rear-Admiral C.

He was the uncle of William Sprague IV, also a Governor and Senator from Rhode Island. ==Biography== William Sprague was the son of William Sprague [1773-1836] and Anna Potter [1763-1828]. He was born in the Gov. William Sprague Mansion in Cranston, Rhode Island, and pursued classical studies as a student. He engaged in mercantile pursuits and was a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, serving as speaker from 1832 to 1835 and leading a coalition of Anti-Masonic and Democratic Party members. He was elected as an at-large candidate from the Whig Party to the Twenty-fourth Congress and served from March 4, 1835, to March 3, 1837. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1836. He was elected Governor of Rhode Island in 1838. He subsequently was elected as a Whig to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Nathan F. Dixon and served from February 18, 1842, to January 17, 1844, when he resigned. He served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills in the Twenty-seventh Congress. He was a U.S. presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1848. His family fortune came from the cotton and paint manufacturing, and he assumed active control of the family business following the murder of his brother Amasa on December 31, 1843. The Senator took an active interest in the trial of the Gordon brothers for the murder. The trial resulted in one of the defendants being sent to the gallows, and remains highly controversial for the amount of anti-Irish bigotry involved. In 2011, the condemned man was posthumously pardoned by the Rhode Island governor.Erika Niedowski, \\"RI governor pardons Irish man hanged in 1845\\", Associated Press, 2011-06-29. In addition to the family business, he was president of the Hartford, Providence, and Fishkill Railroad, and of two banks. The extended Sprague family has descendants who live in the Utica, New York area. Sprague died in Providence, Rhode Island, and is interred in Swan Point Cemetery there. ==References== ==Further reading== *Hoffman, Charles, and Hoffman, Tess.

Since 1953, it has been the home of the Theatre Workshop company, famously associated with Joan Littlewood. ==History== The theatre was designed by architect James George Buckle, who was commissioned by the actor- manager Charles Dillon in 1884. It is the architect's only surviving work, built on the site of a wheelwright's shop on Salway Road, close to the junction with Angel Lane.Theatre Royal history Retrieved 28 April 2007 It opened on 17 December 1884 with a revival of Richelieu by Edward Bulwer- Lytton. Two years later, Dillon sold it to Albert O'Leary Fredericks, his sister's brother-in-law and one of the original backers of the scheme. In 1887 the theatre was renamed Theatre Royal and Palace of Varieties and side extensions were added in 1887. The stage was enlarged in 1891, by the original architect. In 1902, Frank Matcham undertook minor improvements to the entrance and foyer.Earl and Sell (2000), pp. 142 The Theatre reverted to its Theatre Royal Stratford East ('TRSE') name in 1914. A fire on the stage on August Bank Holiday Monday of 1921 did considerable damage to the rear of the theatre. Thankfully the fire happened at midnight, with the safety curtain lowered, saving the auditorium which retains many of its original features to this day. The theatre was closed until January 1922. The Fredericks family continued to manage the theatre until 1932, although after the World War I, the theatre fell into financial difficulties, opening only irregularly after 1926.West Ham: Worthies, entertainments, sports and pastimes, A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 64–67 Retrieved: 29 May 2008 The proscenium is surmounted by the letters \\"FF\\", commemorating the association with the Fredericks – possibly Frederick Fredericks, the husband of Dillon's sister, and a successful actor in his own right. Theatre superstition has it that should the letters ever be removed, the theatre will crumble. TRSE closed in 1938 and remained closed until 1943. Revues were then briefly tried, but failed, and again the theatre was closed until October 1946. Taken over by David Horne, it briefly became a successful playhouse including the legendary premiere of Patrick Hamilton's Gaslight, with Sybil Thorndike and Derek Bond – which ran for six months and was the theatre's first transfer to the West End. The theatre closed again in December 1949. Audio description of the theatre by Barbara Windsor. In late 1950, a touring company presented the Christmas pantomime, Alice in Wonderland. Highly experimental, its success was by no means guaranteed or uniform throughout the tour. \\"They'll lynch us\\", recalls Sven Stahl. \\"I still have nightmares about Alice in Wonderland at Barnsley and the miners throwing pennies at John Blanshard.\\" The company were to return, as the Theatre Workshop in 1953, with artistic director Joan Littlewood and take over the theatre. The theatre came under threat with the construction of the Stratford shopping centre in the 1970s, but was saved by a public campaign and protected in June 1972 by English Heritage with a Grade II* listing.English Heritage listing details Retrieved 28 April 2007 Money remained short, and the manager, Gerry Raffles, only managed redecoration and replacements as cash became available. In 2001, following a successful Heritage Lottery Fund bid, all of the theatre's front of house and backstage areas were refurbished as part of the Olympiad's Stratford Cultural Quarter project. In 1990, TRSE scored a massive hit with the premiere of Five Guys Named Moe, which immediately transferred to the West End and won the Olivier Award for Best Entertainment. The show has been produced all over the word, including Broadway, and continues to be revived regularly. In 2004, TRSE made history by having the first British Black musical, The Big Life, transfer to London's West End, where it played at the Apollo Theatre. In 2005, the theatre produced a musical version of the cult Jamaican film The Harder They Come – famous for its reggae soundtrack, which also transferred to the West End. This production was written by the film director Perry Henzel and was one of the most successful productions in the theatre's history. In 2018, Nadia Fall became Artistic Director. ==Artistic directors== ===Joan Littlewood (1953–1974)=== The Theatre Royal became famous under the management of Gerry Raffles (1928–1975), who worked with director Joan Littlewood on such productions as A Taste of Honey and Oh, What a Lovely War!. In 1975, her collaborator and partner, Gerry Raffles died of diabetes, and in 1979, a devastated Joan Littlewood moved to France, never to direct again. Notable names to get their break at TRSE include Richard Harris, Murray Melvin, Barbara Windsor, Victor Spinetti, Brian Murphy, Avis Bunnage, Harry H Corbett, Yootha Joyce, composer/lyricist Lionel Bart, and writer Shelagh Delaney. Michael Caine was famously told by Littlewood: “P*ss off to Shaftesbury Avenue. You will only ever be a star. ” ===Ken Hill (1974–1975)=== The playwright and director Ken Hill, a protegé of Joan Littlewood, took over as artistic director after she moved to France, prompted by the death of her partner, Gerry Raffles. After his short tenure as Artistic Director, Hill continued to work with TRSE until his death, most notably in raucous musicals. They included The Invisible Man which transferred from TRSE to the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End in 1993 and Zorro! The Musical which opened two weeks after Hill's death in 1995. Notable productions by Ken Hill at the TRSE include On Your Way, Riley! by Alan Plater, Scrape Off the Black by Tunde Ikoli, and My Girl by Barrie Keeffe. ===Maxwell Shaw (1975–1977) === Maxwell Shaw, another member of the original Theatre Workshop, was a character actor on both stage and film, most notably in The Oblong Box and Start The Revolution Without Me. He opened his tenure at the TRSE with his own adaptation of a Georges Feydeau farce Out of Practice. ===Clare Venables (1977–1979)=== Clare Venables was artistic director from 1977 to 1979. She went on to run the Crucible Theatre Sheffield from 1981 to 1992, was a founding director of the Actors’ Centre and a member of the Arts Council Drama panel. She was principal of the BRIT School of Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon from 1995 to 1999; and director of education of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1991 until her death in 2003. Notable Venables productions included Old King Cole, The Silver Tassie, The Funniest Man in the World, and Sisters. ===Philip Hedley (1979–2004)=== Philip Hedley, who had worked as an assistant to Joan Littlewood for some years, took over the artistic directorship of the Theatre Royal from Clare Venables in 1979. He provided traditional entertainment in style of old music hall variety shows on Sunday evenings while seeking to engage with new Asian and Black audiences, as the local demographic changed. The theatre continued Littlewood's agenda to portray and express the experience of local people in East London. In 1999, he began the Musical Theatre Initiatives scheme to encourage new writing in musical theatre. The final show he produced at Stratford East, The Big Life, was the first black British musical to go to the West End. In 2004, after 25 years as artistic director, he retired. ===Kerry Michael (2004–2017)=== Kerry Michael joined Stratford East in 1997, as an associate director, becoming artistic director in September 2004. His manifesto is to bring London's new communities to the stage, and portray their experiences as second and third generation emigrants.Ones to Watch – The Sunday Times, Culture, 9 January 2005 His debut play as artistic director was The Battle of Green Lanes by Cosh Omar, set amongst London's Cypriot society. He directed the hit musicals The Harder They Come (at Theatre Royal Stratford East and then transferred to The Barbican and the West End's Playhouse Theatre) and also Come Dancing by Ray Davies and Paul Sirett. In 2007, Pied Piper won the Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in an Affiliate Theatre, as did Cora Bissett's play Roadkill. in 2011. The theatre was nominated again in 2014 with their production of Oh! What a Lovely War!, a revival of the Joan Littlewood classic. Michael also directed the annual pantomime and was again nominated for an Olivier Award for Cinderella. In 2012 Stratford East, 'fast becoming one of the UK's most innovative and interactive theatres', launched its Open Stage Project, enabling people to participate with everything from programming ideas to working on productions. 2014 productions at TRSE included David Baddiel's musical The Infidel, co-directed by Kerry Michael and David Baddiel. The 2016 season included Hotel Cerise, an adaptation of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard by Bonnie Greer. In 2016 Kerry Michael expanded TRSE across the square to Gerry's, a new cafe and an 80-seater studio. Kerry Michael stepped down as Artistic Director in 2017. ===Nadia Fall (2017-Present)=== A director and playwright, Fall has worked extensively at the Royal National Theatre, directing shows including Chewing Gum Dreams, Our Country's Good and Home – which she also wrote. Fall has also worked with London's Hampstead Theatre and Bush Theatre, where she directed Taylor Mac's Hir. Fall's first season (Sep 2018-Jul 2019) opened with an adaptation of Lope de Vega's Fuenteovejuna by April De Angelis called The Village featuring Anya Chalotra and Art Malik. The season also included the UK premiere of The Wolves by Sarah DeLappe, Ballet Black, pantomime Sleeping Beauty, Frantic Assembly's The Unreturning by Anna Jordan, a revival of Peter Shaffer's Equus directed by Ned Bennett and co-produced with English Touring Theatre. The critically acclaimed production transferred to the West End in summer 2019 playing at Trafalgar Studios. Other shows included Pilot Theatre's touring show Noughts & Crosses (novel series), an adaptation of Malorie Blackman's novel by Sabrina Mahfouz, August Wilson's play King Hedley II, directed by Fall and starring Lenny Henry, Cherrelle Skeete, Leo Wringer, Martina Laird, Dexter Flanders and Aaron Pierre as Hedley. The season ended with a co-production with English National Opera for Benjamin Britten's community opera Noye's Fludde directed by Lyndsey Turner and featured different community groups and schools across Newham and East London. Equus won three Off-West End Awards in 2020, including Best Production, Best Director (Ned Bennett) and Best Lighting Design (Jessica Hung Han Yun).https://offies.london/2020-awards/ Fall's second season (Sep 2019-Jul 2020) opened with Katori Hall's Our Lady of Kibeho and included the return of Ballet Black, pantomime Dick Whittington, Eclipse Theatre's new play The Gift by Janice Okoh and Frantic Assembly's 25th anniversary play I Think We Are Alone by Sally Abbott and co-directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham. The rest of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This included a new verbatim play by Nadia Fall Welcome To Iran in co-production with the National Theatre, an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist by Bryony Lavery for Ramps on the Moon and a revival of Roy Williams' seminal play Sucker Punch, directed by Roy Alexander Weise.

He made his fortune manufacturing various items, but especially buttons using the process, he later diversified into making cast steel and saws. ==Early years and apprenticeship== The Thomas Boulsover memorial at Wire Mill Dam Boulsover was born in Longley, which was then a remote hamlet between the town of Sheffield and the village of Ecclesfield, He was the son of Samuel Boulsover, a farmer and cutler and Margaret Brownell of Hathersage, being baptised at Ecclesfield church on 18 October 1705. He began his apprenticeship to learn the trade of cutler in 1718, being apprenticed to Joseph Fletcher, a native of Wirksworth in Derbyshire who had established himself as a cutler in Sheffield. Fletcher was a Presbyterian and the young Boulsover would have been brought up with the same religious views as it was expected that an apprentice would join his master and family in their manner of worship. Thomas Boulsover's apprenticeship was completed in 1726 and he was granted the freedom of the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire on 26 November of that year, the act being recorded in the Freedoms Book at the Cutlers' Hall. As was traditional Boulsover was also awarded his own trademark and this was registered in the Mark Book.\\"The Oldest Sheffield Plater\\", John & Julia Hatfield, The Advertiser Press Ltd, 1974 No ISBN, General Biography. ==Cutler== Boulsover chose to practice as a free cutler in the developing township of Sheffield and on 28 October 1728 he married Hannah Dodworth of Owlerton at Sheffield parish church, they set up home in the Norfolk Street area where groups of cutlers were settling in newly built properties. The Boulsovers' first child Sarah was born in June 1729 but the infant soon died; the Boulsovers had ten children throughout their marriage of which only two survived to adulthood. Thomas Boulsover continued as a cutler, with several apprentices working for him over the years; in the early 1740s he moved his business to new premises on Sycamore Hill (now Tudor Street) the workshop being on the corner of Tudor Street and Surrey Street opposite the present day Sheffield Central Library. ==Sheffield plate== The Thomas Boulsover memorial at Tudor Square in central Sheffield. In early 1743 Boulsover made the accidental discovery which was to change his life and have an immense effect on the success and development of Sheffield. While repairing the decorative handle of a knife made from copper and silver he accidentally slightly overheated the handle causing the two metals to fuse. Boulsover's initial despair at ruining a customer's expensive knife soon turned to elation when he realised the significance and potential of his find. Boulsover experimented with his discovery of Sheffield Plate and found that when the silver and copper were fused together they could be treated as one metal, meaning that an ingot of copper fused with a layer of silver could be rolled to any area and thickness and still retain the same proportion of the two metals. This satisfied Boulsover that the fused metal could be modelled into any article and could be used on a commercial scale. Thomas Boulsover needed financial assistance to set up a business in fused plate and it came from Mr Strelley Pegge of Beauchief Hall who loaned him the necessary capital. He went into partnership with Joseph Wilson whose father was a scythe smith at Sharrow, setting up a workshop on Baker's Hill in Sheffield. The main product of the business was to make buttons from fused plate which would cost only a fraction of the cost of solid silver buttons. Boulsover's buttons were stamped from a die on a fused metal sheet, then cut out, polished and burnished until they were hardly distinguishable from genuine silver.\\"A History Of Sheffield\\", David Hey, Carnegie Publishing, , Button making process. The business also made buckles, spurs and small snuff boxes. Joseph Wilson left the partnership in the mid 1740s, setting up his own business at Sharrow Mills making Sheffield plate items before diversifying into manufacturing snuff for which the Wilsons became World-famous. In 1749 Boulsover rented a lease of land in Beeley Wood to build a grinding wheel, but an alteration to the original lease allowed it to be converted into a tilt forge known as the Nova Scotia Tilts.\\"Water Power On The Sheffield Rivers\\", David Crossley et al, H. Charlesworth & Co Ltd, 1989 , Details of Nova Scotia Tilt. tilthammer.com Biographical details. Thomas Boulsover repaid the money loaned from Strelley Pegge and continued his enterprise with the help of two apprentices, also hiring John Hoyland as an agent to promote the sale of his buttons. Unfortunately Boulsover did not take out a patent on his discovery of Sheffield plate and Hoyland set up a business of his own making buttons and passed the secrets of the process on to others. Despite this competition, Boulsover's button business thrived. In 1751 Thomas was elected as one of the 24 assistants to the Master Cutler, however even though he was re-elected as an assistant the following year he never rose any higher in the Company of Cutlers. In 1757 he moved his business to larger premises on Norfolk Street (now the location of the Crucible Theatre stage door), in the same year he bought Whiteley Wood Hall from his initial patron Strelley Pegge. Now a member of the gentry, Boulsover's guidance as a leading townsman was eagerly sought; he became involved in discussions on the Sheffield to Leeds turnpike road and became one of the original trustees. Riversheaf.org Biographical details. ==Later life== In 1760 Boulsover turned his interest to manufacturing better quality steel. He purchased land from the Duke of Norfolk on the Porter Brook just below Whiteley Wood Hall and commenced rolling steel. He discovered that cast steel gave a much better edge to saws and concentrated on saw making, with his product being far superior to those made by the old method of hammering. In 1774 Boulsover & Co., based at Whiteley Woods and Norfolk Street, was described as “makers of saws, fenders, edge tools, cast steel and emory”. However button production continued at a site further up the Porter at Forge Dam, Fulwood. Friends of the Porter Valley Details of Forge Dam. Methodist chapel at Meadow Farm built as a memorial to Boulsover by his daughters. In 1772 Hannah Boulsover, Thomas's wife died and was buried in the churchyard of St Paul's Church on 9 July. The couple had been married for almost 44 years. As Thomas Boulsover grew older, he was helped by Anthony Thompson whom he had taken into partnership and who eventually took over the management of the rolling mills and saw manufacture. Thomas Boulsover died at Whiteley Wood Hall on Tuesday 9 September 1788 and was buried on 13 September at St Paul's church alongside Hannah. Early in 1789, Boulsover's two surviving children Mary Mitchell and Sarah Hutton built a small Methodist chapel near to Whiteley Wood Hall in memory of their father. The chapel still stands today although it is now an outbuilding of Meadow Farm. It has an plaque which reads “This chapel was built by Mary Mitchell and Sarah Hutton in 1789 in memory of their father Thomas Boulsover the inventor of Sheffield Plate (1705 - 1788). ==References== Category:People from Ecclesfield Category:English inventors Category:History of Sheffield Category:1705 births Category:1788 deaths Category:British industrialists Category:Businesspeople from Sheffield ","title":"Thomas Boulsover"},{"id":"1423551","text":"Becel is a brand of margarine produced by Upfield and sold in a number of countries including Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, and Turkey. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa the product is sold under the name Flora, in France as Fruit d'Or, in Israel as Mazola, and in the United States as Promise. The name Becel originates from the three letter acronym BCL (Blood Cholesterol Lowering). When introduced, the blood cholesterol lowering effect was achieved by modifying the triacylglycerol (TAG) profile of the fat used in the margarine: an increased level of poly- unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the blood cholesterol level.A. Keys et al., Serum cholesterol response to changes in the diet. IV. Particular saturated fatty acids in the diet, Metabolism 14, 776-787 (1965) More recently, products were introduced under the \\"Pro-activ\\" sub-brand. These products are based on the effects of plant sterols and sterol esters on blood cholesterol lowering.M.B. Katan et al., Efficacy and Safety of Plant Stanols and Sterols in the Management of Blood Cholesterol Levels, Mayo Clinic Proceedings 78, 965-978 (2003) In recent years the Becel/Flora brand has added cooking oil, pot yogurt and yogurt drinks to the non-margarine products, all of which are designed to help lower blood cholesterol level. This is achieved by a highly increased resorption of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols which accumulate especially in the intima of blood vessels and may cause arteriosclerotic plaques. In consequence, consumption of Becel products does not lower the risk for coronary diseases such as arteriosclerosis and therefore does not inherit any medical benefits. ==European Food Safety Authority== In light of supporting evidence from various clinical trials, Becel Pro-activ gained the European Union's European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) approval for its claim to reduce the levels of cholesterol in the blood. It does not reduce the risk of heart disease, and is not claimed to do so by Upfield, although many consumers believe it does. ==2010 Academy Awards controversy== In 2009, Becel commissioned Sarah Polley to direct a two-minute short \\"to inspire women to take better care of that particular vital organ\\" [the heart]. A week before the short's planned premiere in Canada during a commercial break during the CTV broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards, Polley attracted headlines for taking her name off the film. Polley had understood that the film, titled \\"The Heart\\", would be used to promote the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, but was unhappy with the association with Becel. \\"Regretfully, I am forced to remove my name from the film and disassociate myself from it. I have never actively promoted any corporate brand, and cannot do so now.\\" In response, Becel said it was a \\"founding sponsor\\" of the Canadian Heart Truth campaign and had commissioned the film \\"to put heart health on the radar of Canadian women.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Becel Brazil website *Becel Canada website *Becel Denmark website *Becel Germany website *Becel Netherlands website *Becel Belgium website *Becel Turkey website *Flora Poland website *Flora UK website *Flora pro.activ website *Fruit d'Or France website Category:Former Unilever brands Category:Upfield (company) brands Category:Margarine brands ","title":"Becel"},{"id":"1423554","text":"Henry Cruger Jr. (November 22, 1739April 24, 1827) was an American and British merchant at the time of the American Revolution. He has a unique distinction of having been elected to both the Parliament of Great Britain (MP, 1774–1780, 1784–1790) and the New York State Senate (1792–1796). ==Early life== Henry Cruger was born in New York and was a member of a wealthy merchant family. His parents were Elizabeth (née Harris) Cruger (1716–1752) and Henry Cruger Sr. (1707–1780), a member of the New York General Assembly and then the Governor- General's Council. His eldest brother, John Harris Cruger, succeeded his father as a member of the governor's council of New York, served as a Loyalist during the War and later moved to England. Two other brothers settled in the West Indies. His younger sister, Mary Cruger, was married to Jacob Walton, also a representative in General Assembly for New York. His paternal grandparents were Maria (née Cuyler) Cruger, an heiress (and sister of Albany Mayor Johannes Cuyler), and John Cruger, an alderman who served as the 38th mayor of New York City and was born in Bristol, England. His uncle John Cruger Jr. served as the 41st mayor of New York City and was the last Speaker of the New York General Assembly. Cruger studied at King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City, but before being graduated he moved to Bristol, England in 1757. ==Career== Upon his relocation to Bristol, he was placed in a family mercantile house and became wealthy until the Stamp Act greatly affected his livelihood and caused him much financial embarrassment. In 1765, Cruger was elected to the Bristol Common Council, a position he held until 1790. He was named sheriff of the city for 1766–1767. Cruger was elected a warden of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1768, and Master of the Society in 1781. His father, who came to England in 1775, died in Bristol in 1780. ===Political career=== Cruger, who was known for his \\"ready wit and fine conversational powers,\\" was elected as Member of Parliament for Bristol as a radical Whig in the 1774 general election in which British policy towards the colonies was an important issue. The other Whig candidate, also elected, but by a smaller majority, was Edmund Burke, who was, among other things, the provincial agent for the Province of New York. In his maiden speech before Parliament, Cruger criticized it for worsening the breach between Britain and her colonies. In 1776, he faulted the ministry for abandoning British sympathizers in the colony of New York. In 1777, he supported the repeal of the Declaratory Act (1766), and by 1780, he favored American independence.Sir Lewis Namier and John Brooks, eds. The House of Commons, 1754-1790, vol. 2 (Oxford University Press, 1964), 280-282. Defeated for reelection in 1780, he became Bristol's mayor in 1781. In the 1784 general election, Cruger was again returned to Parliament as the member for Bristol as a supporter of William Pitt the Younger. Throughout his political career in England he urged conciliation with America. In 1789, he sought in vain for a consular appointment in the United States from Pitt.Henry Cruger Van Schaack, Henry Cruger: the Colleague of Edmund Burke in the British Parliament; a Paper Read before the New-York Historical Society, January 4, 1859 (New York: C. B. Richardson, 1859) Cruger returned to New York in 1790 after an absence of 33 years and was elected as a Federalist to the New York State Senate in 1792, urging conciliation with Great Britain while serving an otherwise undistinguished single four-year term in the 16th to the 19th New York State Legislatures. ==Personal life== Portrait of Cruger's son-in-law, Lawrence Reid Yates, by Gilbert Stuart. Cruger was married three times, firstly in December 1765 to Ellin Hannah Peach, a daughter of Samuel Peach of Tockington a wealthy linen draper and banker. She died in 1767, leaving a son: * Samuel Peach Cruger (1767–1845), who changed his name to Samuel Peach Peach by 1788 after inheriting his grandfather Samuel's fortune, and home Tackington House, Gloucester. Cruger then married Caroline Elizabeth Blair, with whom he had six children, including: * Henry H. Cruger, who married his first cousin, Mary Cruger, daughter of Nicolas Cruger. * William Cruger. * John Cruger (1774–1812), who married Martha Ramsay (1780–1848). * Matilda Cruger (1776–1812), who married Lawrence Reid Yates (d. 1796) in 1795. After his death, she married her cousin, Judge Henry Walton, with whom she had six children. Henry and Elizabeth returned to New York in 1790, where Elizabeth died shortly thereafter. He married for the third time in 1799, when he was age 60, to Caroline Smith. Together, they were the parents of four more children, including: * Matilda Caroline Cruger (1809–1891), the wife of Thomas Jackson Oakley, a New York State Attorney General and U.S. Representative, in 1831. Cruger died at home in New York City on April 24, 1827 in his 88th year, and was buried in the Trinity Church Cemetery. right ===Legacy=== Cruger's house in Park Street, Bristol, on the corner of Great George Street, is marked by a commemorative plaque. ==See also== *Peter van Schaack ==ReferencesPortrait of Henry Cruger Jr. by George Romney, , at the New-York Historical Society Category:1739 births Category:1827 deaths Category:British MPs 1774–1780 Category:British MPs 1784–1790 Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:Members of the New York General Assembly Category:New York (state) state senators Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:High Sheriffs of Bristol Category:Mayors of Bristol Category:People of colonial New York Category:Colonial American merchants Category:Burials at Trinity Church Cemetery Category:Members of the Society of Merchant Venturers ","title":"Henry Cruger"},{"id":"1423557","text":"Holos is an influential OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) product of the 1990s. Developed by Holistic Systems in 1987, the product remained in use until around 2004. ==Conception== The Holos product succeeded an older generation of mainframe products such as System-W. It was the first to use an industry standard SQL database (as opposed to a proprietary one), and also the first to use the new GUI PC for the user interface. In physically separating the number crunching from the user interface, the product's model was immediately client/server, although that term didn't come into use until some time later. In fact, the model was described as cooperative processing until the term client/server became ubiquitous. The client/server model used for Holos was initially for a very \\"light\\" client as it was not clear then (1986/7) that PCs were going to be so commonplace, and most were still running MS-DOS. In fact, it was technically possible to run the system using \\"dumb\\" terminal with reduced functionality in early versions although, save for in Holistic's test environment, this was rarely if ever done. In time, due to the increased popularly of PCs, their increased power, and the availability of a stable and more functional version of Microsoft Windows, additional functionality was added to the client end mostly in the form of development aids. In addition to data services, the Holos Server supplied business logic and calculation services. It also provided complementary services to the Holos Client which meant the internal processing associated with the report writer, worksheet, etc., was distributed between the two components. ==Architecture== The core of the Holos Server was a business intelligence (BI) virtual machine. The Holos Language (HL), used to drive server-side applications, was compiled into a soft instruction code and executed in this virtual machine (similar in concept to Java in more modern systems). The virtual machine was fully fault- tolerant, using structured exception handling internally, and provided a debugger interface. The debugger was virtual-machine-level until quite late on, after which it also supported source-level access. OLAP data was handled as a core data type of HL, with specific syntax to accommodate multidimensional data concepts, and complete programmatic freedom to explore and use the data. This made it very different from the industry trend of query-based OLAP and SQL engines. On the upside, it allowed amazing flexibility in the applications to which it could be applied. On the downside, it mean that 3-tier configurations were never successfully implemented since the processing had to be close to the data itself. This hindered large-scale deployment to many clients, and the use of OLAP data from other vendors. In reality, its own data access times were probably some of the fastest around—at the individual cell level; they had to be in order to be practical. However, when fetching back bulk data from non-cooperating servers, or data from other vendors, the queries could not be optimised as a whole. Its own data access used a machine-wide shared memory cache. ==Language== The Holos Language was a very broad language in that it covered a wide range of statements and concepts, including the reporting system, business rules, OLAP data, SQL data (using the Embedded SQL syntax within the hosting HL), device properties, analysis, forecasting, and data mining. It even supported elements to enable self-documentation and self-verification. Placing all these areas on a common footing, and allowing them to co-operate by sharing data, events, etc., was key to the number of possibilities that resulted. For instance, the report writer supported data input as well as output, plus interactive graphics, and a comprehensive event mechanism to pass back information about the viewed data to event handlers. Also, reports and data were separate entities, thus allowing the same report to be applied to different data as long as it was described by similar meta-data. This meant that when terms like EIS and MIS were first coined, the industry norm was \\"slideshows\\", i.e. pre-programmed transitions between views, whereas Holos provided data-driven drill-down, i.e. no pre-programmed views or links. The transitions could be made dependent upon the data values and trends, in conjunction with the available business logic. ==OLAP Storage== Holos Server provided an array of different, but compatible, storage mechanisms for its multi-cube architecture: memory, disk, SQL. It was therefore the first product to provide \\"hybrid OLAP\\" (HOLAP). It provided a very versatile mechanism for joining cubes, irrespective of their storage technology, dimensionality, or meta-data, and this was eventually given a US patent (called COA—Compound OLAP Architecture ). The COA mechanism allowed combinations of the following core transformations: the meta-data for a cube to be overridden (i.e. making a cube look different), allowing cubes to be joined side-by-side, in a 'rack' (i.e. increasing the dimensionality by one), supporting SQL-like operators to fold-up one-or-more dimensions on a cube, or 'stack' one 'rack' above another. The phrase 'rack and stack' was commonly used at the time. COA also accommodated other COA cubes seamlessly, and several customers used this to multiple depths. As a practical example, the issue of multiple time dimensions was well-known in BI applications: do you design the data to show a year-on-year comparison (typically requiring separate year and month-per-year time dimensions), or to show continuous time (typically requiring a single time dimension with months spanning two or more years). The choice was usually based on whether you wanted to see a trend or year-on-year comparison. With COA, the data could be designed according to efficiency (locality, life-cycle, or maintenance) as the view required by any given application would be achieved using COA, which was only a meta-data construct and required no physical data change. One novel aspect of this was a 'stack' feature that allowed read/write cubes to be stacked over read-only cubes. Read operations to the overall virtual cube then visited both 'racks' (top first, and then the bottom), whereas write operations only affected the top. The resulting valve-like mechanism found many applications in data sharing, what-if forecasting, and aggregation of slow SQL-based data. Since the overhead of the joining was small, it was not uncommon to have stacks 7 levels deep, and joining terabytes of real OLAP data. Around about V8.5, Holos Server implemented a hierarchical lock manager, allowing nesting of fine and coarse-grain OLAP locks, and full transaction control. ==Business Rules== The business logic supported full cross-dimensional calculations, automatic ordering of rules using static data-flow analysis, and the identification and solution of simultaneous equations. The rules treated all dimensions in an orthogonal fashion. The aggregation process did not distinguish between simple summation or average calculations, and more complex non-commutative calculations. Both could be applied to any dimension member. The process allowed aggregation levels (i.e. those calculation levels starting with base data (level 0) and proceeding up to the overall grand total) to be individually pre-stored or left to be calculated on demand. ==Holos Client== The Holos Client was both a design and delivery vehicle, and this made it quite large. Around about 2000, the Holos Language was made object-oriented (HL++) with a view to allowing the replacement of the Holos Client with a custom Java or VB product. However, the company were never sold on this, and so the project was abandoned. One of the biggest failures was not to provide a thin-client interface to the Holos Server, and this must have contributed to the product's demise. Although an HTML toolkit was sold, it was considered clumsy and restricted. By the time a real thin-client mechanism was developed, it was far too late and it never got to market. ==Deployment== Before its demise, the Holos Server product ran under Windows NT (Intel and Alpha), VMS (VAX and Alpha), plus about 10 flavours of UNIX, and accessed over half-a- dozen different SQL databases. It was also ported to several different locales, including Japanese. ==Company== Holistic Systems was purchased by the hardware company Seagate Technology in 1996. Along with other companies such as Crystal Services, it was used to create a new subsidiary company called Seagate Software. Only Holistic and Crystal remained, and Seagate Software was renamed to Crystal Decisions. Holistic and Crystal had very different sales models. The average sale for the Holos Product in the United States was in excess of $250,000 and was sold primarily to Fortune 500 companies by a direct sales force. The Crystal sales model was based upon a \\"shrink wrapped\\" product Crystal Reports sold primarily through resellers. As Crystal was acquired prior to Holistic the senior management in the sales and marketing arena were mostly drawn from that organisation. They felt that all the product range should be sold through third parties and over a period of time dismantled the direct sales force culmination in a significant drop in sales for the Holos Product. Subsequently, after some in-fighting and argument over product strategy, the main Holos development team finally started to leave around 2000, and Crystal Decisions was finally taken over by Business Objects in 2004. Following the takeover, support for Holos was outsourced to Raspberry Software, which was set up by former employees of Crystal Decisions.

These included the gradual (texts mainly from the Psalms, with musical notes added), the evangelary or gospel book, the epistolary with texts from other parts of the New Testament, mainly the epistles (letters) of Saint Paul, and the sacramentary with the prayers that the priest himself said.Catholic Encyclopedia: Missal In late mediaeval times, when it had become common in the West for priests to say Mass without the assistance of a choir and other ministers, these books began to be combined into a \\"Mass book\\" (missale in Latin), for the priest's use alone. This led to the appearance of the missale plenum (\\"full or complete missal\\"), which contained all the texts of the Mass, but without the music of the choir parts.Missale plenum Indications of the rubrics to be followed were also added. === Roman Catholicism === The Roman Missal (Missale Romanum) published by Pope Pius V in 1570 eventually replaced the widespread use of different missal traditions by different parts of the church, such as those of Troyes, Sarum (Salisbury), and others. Many episcopal sees had some local prayers and feast days in addition. At the behest of the Second Vatican Council,Sacrosanctum Concilium, 51 Pope Paul VI greatly increased the amount of Sacred Scripture read at Mass and, to a lesser extent, the prayer formulas. This necessitated a return to having the Scripture readings in a separate book, known as the Lectionary. A separate Book of the Gospels, with texts extracted from the Lectionary, is recommended, but is not obligatory. The Roman Missal continues to include elaborate rubrics, as well as antiphons etc., which were not in sacramentaries. The first complete official translation of the Roman Missal into English appeared in 1973, based on the text of 1970. On 28 March 2001, the Holy See issued the Instruction Liturgiam authenticam. This included the requirement that, in translations of the liturgical texts from the official Latin originals, \\"the original text, insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet.\\" The following year, the third typical editionThe \\"typical edition\\" of a liturgical text is that to which editions by other publishers must conform. of the revised Roman Missal in Latin was released. The Anglican Missal sitting on an altar desk in an Anglican parish church These two texts made clear the need for a new official English translation of the Roman Missal, particularly because the previous one was at some points an adaptation rather than strictly a translation. An example is the rendering of the response \\"Et cum spiritu tuo\\" (literally, \\"And with your spirit\\") as \\"And also with you\\". The fresh official English translation, prepared by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL), was adopted by English-speaking episcopal conferences and received confirmation from the Holy See. The text of this revised English translation of the Order of Mass is available at this website page, and a comparison between it and that at present in use in the United States is given under the heading \\"Changes in the People's Parts\\". === Anglicanism === Within the Anglican tradition, in 1921, the Society of Saints Peter and Paul published the Anglican Missal in Great Britain. The Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation of Mount Sinai published a revised edition in 1961 and the Anglican Parishes Association continues to print it. Excerpt from the Missal of the Sint-Pieters abbey (Ghent), manufactured in the 13th century. Manuscript preserved in the Ghent University Library. ==Sections and illumination== In France, missals begin to be illuminated from the beginning of the 13th century. At this time, the missal was normally divided into several parts: calendar, temporal, preface and canon of the mass, sanctoral, votive masses and various additions. Two principal parts of the missal are the temporal and sanctoral. The temporal contains texts for the mass, day by day for the whole liturgical year, organized around Christmas and Easter. The sanctoral presents a liturgical year through the commemoration of saints. Finally, votive masses (a mass for a specific purpose or read with a specific intent by the priest), different prayers, new feasts, commemoration of recent saints and canonizations were usually placed at the end of the missal. Iconographic analysis of the missals of the Diocese of Paris from the 13th-14th centuries shows the use of certain traditional images as well as some changing motifs. Among the former group, some types of initials, including the introit to the First Sunday of Advent; to the preface of the mass for Holy Week; to the masses for saints, containing their images, but also the rich illumination of two pages of the missal in full size: the Crucifixion of Jesus and Christ in Majesty. The second group with changing scenes include some images of the clergy that are not depicted in all missals, but can be a repeating motif pertaining to only one manuscript. This can be the priest at prayer, the priest elevating the host (sacramental bread), monks in song and so forth. Catholic missals after the Second Vatican Council (1962−1965) are only little illustrated, at least before 2002, mostly with black-and-white pictures. Since 2005, many editions of the Editio typica tertia of the Roman Missal have been illustrated in colour, especially in the English-speaking world.Ralf van Bühren, Die Bildausstattung des „Missale Romanum“ nach dem Zweiten Vatikanischen Konzil (1962−1965), in Liturgische Bücher in der Kulturgeschichte Europas, ed. by Hanns Peter Neuheuser, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2018, pp. 173–181. ==Hand missals for use by laypeople == The term \\"missal\\" is also used for books intended for use not by the priest but by others assisting at Mass or the service of worship. These books are sometimes referred to as \\"hand missals\\" or \\"missalettes\\", while the term \\"altar missal\\" is sometimes used to distinguish the missal for the priest's use from them. Usually they omit or severely abbreviate the rubrical portions and Mass texts for other than the regular yearly celebrations, but include the Scripture readings. One such missal has been used for the swearing in of a United States President. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States aboard Air Force One using a missal of the late President, because it was presumed to be a Bible.Transcript, Lawrence F.

Lackawanna was launched by the New York Navy Yard on 9 August 1862; sponsored by Ms. Imogen Page Cooper; and commissioned on 8 January 1863, Captain John B. Marchand in command. She was named after the Lackawanna River in Pennsylvania. ==Civil War== The new screw sloop-of-war departed New York on 20 January, to join the Union blockade of the southern coast. She reported to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron at Pensacola, Florida early in February and, for the remainder of the war, served along the gulf coast of the Confederacy, principally off Mobile Bay. Lackawanna took her first prize — Neptune — on 14 June after a long chase in which the Glasgow ship had jettisoned her cargo trying to escape. The Union sloop-of-war scored again the next day, capturing steamer Planter as the Mobile blockade runner attempted a dash to Havana, Cuba laden with cotton and resin. Following duty along the Texas coast near Galveston in March–April 1864, Lackawanna returned to the blockade of Mobile early in May to prevent the escape of Confederate ram Tennessee. During the summer she served in the blockade while preparing for Admiral David Farragut's conquest of Mobile Bay. On 9 July, with , , and , she braved the guns of Fort Morgan to shell steamer Virgin, a large blockade runner aground at the entrance of Mobile Bay. The Union guns forced a southern river steamer to abandon efforts to assist Virgin, but the next day the Confederates refloated the blockade runner which reached safety in Mobile Bay. Closing this strategic southern port was an important part of the Union strategy to isolate and subdue the South. At dawn on the morning of 5 August, Farragut's ships crossed the bar and entered the bay. A Confederate squadron, led by ironclad ram Tennessee and a field of deadly mines awaited to block their advance. Farragut's lead monitor struck a mine and went down in seconds. The Confederate flagship Tennessee vainly tried to ram and the action became general, raging for more than an hour. At one point in the struggle, Lackawanna rammed Tennessee at full speed, causing the Confederate ram to list, and later she collided with while attempting to ram Tennessee again, shortly before the ironclad struck. This daring operation closed the last major gulf port to the South. Twelve of Lackawanna's sailors received the Medal of Honor for their actions during this battle: * Seaman John M. Burns * Landsman Michael Cassidy * Landsman Louis G. Chaput * Landsman Patrick Dougherty * Captain of the Top John Edwards * Landsman Samuel W. Kinnaird * Seaman Adam McCullock * Boatswain's Mate William Phinney * Captain of Forecastle John Smith * Armorer George Taylor * Quarter Gunner James Ward * Quartermaster Daniel Whitfield Following the Union victory in Mobile Bay, Lackawanna continued to operate in the gulf, enforcing the blockade until after the end of the Civil War. She departed Key West on 24 June 1865, reached New York on the 28th, and decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 20 July. ==Post-war== ===Pacific, 1866–1885=== Recommissioned on 7 May 1866, Commander William Reynolds in command, Lackawanna sailed for the South Atlantic on 4 August, transited the Straits of Magellan on 9 November, and arrived Honolulu, Hawaii on 9 February 1867. Lackawanna sailed to Midway Island and, on August 28, 1867, Captain Reynolds took formal possession of the island for the United States. She continued to operate in the Pacific, primarily in the Hawaiian Islands and along the coast of California and Mexico until she arrived at Mare Island for decommissioning on 10 February 1871. Recommissioning on 8 May 1872, the steam sloop sailed for the Orient on 22 June and served in the Far East until returning to San Francisco on 23 April 1875. In October 1880, in the midst of the War of the Pacific, Lackawanna sailed for the South Pacific to host a conference of diplomacy proposed by the U.S. to end the war, such conference took place at the port of Arica. Officials from the countries involved in the war – Peru, Chile, and Bolivia – did not reach an immediate agreement and U.S. efforts failed.B.W. Farcau, The Ten Cents War For two brief periods, Lackawanna continued to operate in ordinary in the Pacific during the next 12 years. On 16 March 1883 at Honolulu, Captain of the Hold Louis Williams jumped overboard and rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. A year later, at Callao, Peru, on 13 June 1884, Williams again rescued a man from drowning, along with Ordinary Seaman Isaac L. Fasseur. Both Williams and Fasseur were awarded a Medal of Honor for this act, making Williams one of the few two-time recipients of the award. Lackawanna finally decommissioned at Mare Island on 7 April 1885 and was sold there to W. T. Garratt & Company on 30 July 1887. ==References== * Category:Sloops of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Brooklyn Category:Ships of the War of the Pacific Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:1862 ships ","title":"USS Lackawanna (1862)"},{"id":"1423589","text":"Karnataka Vikas Party (Karnataka Development Party), was a regional political party in Karnataka, India, formed when Sarekoppa Bangarappa left the Indian National Congress in 1996.

Head restraints are safety items which are mandatory when competing with most major motorsports sanctioning bodies. These devices reduce the likelihood of head and/or neck injuries, including the often fatal basilar skull fracture, in the event of a crash. There are many such devices on the market today, but the HANS is the original and the most common. ==Description== 1\\\\. HANS device, 2. Tether (one per side), 3. Helmet anchor (one per side), and 4. Shoulder support. Primarily made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer, the HANS device is shaped like a \\"U\\", with the back of the \\"U\\" set behind the nape of the neck and the two arms lying flat along the top of the chest over the pectoral muscles. The device, in general, is supported by the shoulders. It is attached only to the helmet, not to the belts, the driver's body, or the seat; the helmet is attached to the device with the help of an anchor on each side, much like the Hutchens device, but placed slightly back. In a properly installed 5- or 6-point racing harness, the belts that cross the driver's upper body pass directly over the HANS device on the driver's shoulders and buckle at the center of the driver's abdomen. Therefore, the HANS device is secured by the body of the driver, not the seat. The purpose of the HANS device is to keep the head from whipping fore and aft in a crash, preventing excessive rotational movement as a secondary protection, without otherwise restricting movement of the neck. In other words, it allows the wearer's head to move normally, but prevents or restricts head movements during a crash that would exceed the normal articulation range of the musculoskeletal system and cause severe injury. In any kind of crash, the person's body, which is not protected, is decelerated by the seat belt, with the head maintaining velocity until it is decelerated by the neck. The HANS device maintains the relative position of the head to the body, in addition to transferring energy to the much stronger chest, torso, shoulder, seat belts, and seat as the head is decelerated. ==History== WTCC Champion Andy Priaulx with a HANS device The device was designed in the early 1980s by American scientist and researcher Dr. Robert Hubbard (1943–2019), a professor of biomechanical engineering at Michigan State University. After talking to his brother-in-law, accomplished American road- racer Jim Downing, following the death of Patrick Jacquemart, a mutual friend who was killed in an International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) testing accident at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course when his Renault Le Car struck a sandbank, leaving him dead on arrival with head injuries, IMSA officials decided that some sort of protection was required to help prevent injuries from sudden stops, especially during accidents. A major cause of death among drivers during races was through violent head movements, where the body remains in place because of the seat belts, but the momentum keeps the head moving forward, causing a basilar skull fracture, resulting in serious injury or immediate death. Notable race car drivers who died from basilar skull fractures include: * Formula 1 driver Roland Ratzenberger in the 1994 San Marino Formula One Grand Prix. * Indy 500 drivers Scott Brayton, Bill Vukovich and Tony Bettenhausen * NASCAR drivers Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin, Jr.; Terry Schoonover, Grant Adcox, Neil Bonnett, John Nemechek, Dale Earnhardt, J. D. McDuffie, and Clifford Allison * ARCA driver Blaise Alexander * CART driver Gonzalo Rodríguez * Trans Am, Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) driver Jim Fitzgerald NASCAR driver Ken Schrader wearing a HANS device While death from such injuries is usually immediate, some drivers have survived basilar skull fractures, such as NASCAR's Ernie Irvan and F1's Philippe Streiff. Hubbard had extensive experience as a biomechanical crash engineer, including in General Motors' auto safety program. His first prototype was developed in 1985, and in crash tests in 1989 – the first to use crash sleds and crash dummies using race car seat belt harnesses – the energy exerted on the head and neck was lowered by approximately 80%. After major racing safety companies declined to produce the product, Hubbard and Downing formed Hubbard Downing Inc., to develop, manufacture, sell and promote the HANS in 1990. However, the product languished until 1994, when Formula One showed interest in the wake of the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna. In 1999, CART driver Gonzalo Rodríguez was killed after suffering a basilar skull fracture in a crash. At the same time, Mercedes was completing research of the HANS on behalf of the FIA for Formula One, finally deciding that it out-performed their airbag project. The device was first adopted by the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) in 1996, following the death of Top Fuel driver Blaine Johnson, though was not mandatory in the series until 2004, after the death of 2003 Top Fuel Rookie of the Year Darrell Russell, who was killed by flying debris during the Sears Craftsman Nationals in Madison, Illinois. Other racing series were also slow to follow suit. Many drivers, including Dale Earnhardt,Hinton, Ed (2002). Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black. Warner Books. p. 426. . Google Book Search. Retrieved on 2009-06-07. resisted the HANS devices or anything that was similar to them, claiming that they were uncomfortable and more restrictive. There were also fears that it would cause more injuries and problems than it prevented. Some even stated that the positioning of the device made the seat belts feel less secure or rubbed on the shoulders or the collar bone. Earnhardt referred to the device as \\"that damn noose\\", claiming the tethers would more likely hang him than save him in the event of a crash. Media members immediately turned focus to the HANS device after Earnhardt's death. On February 18, 2001, seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup Series Champion Dale Earnhardt was killed on the last lap of the Daytona 500. Earnhardt was the fourth NASCAR driver killed by basilar skull fractures in an eight-month span, following Adam Petty in May 2000, Kenny Irwin, Jr. in July 2000, and Tony Roper in October 2000. While it is still debated whether Earnhardt's death was the result of a broken seat belt or an inadequate head and neck restraint, he died of a basilar skull fracture, which likely would have been prevented by the proper use of belts and a head and neck restraint. After Earnhardt's death, HANS device co-founder Hubbard was quoted: Even after Earnhardt's death, use of the HANS device or similar products was resisted. The following weekend, Mark Martin said at Rockingham, \\"I would not wear one for anything. I'll just keep my fingers crossed and take my chances\\". Following an extensive investigation into Earnhardt’s death that ended in August 2001, NASCAR did not make any immediate changes regarding use of HANS. Then on October 4, 2001, in an ARCA race being held in conjunction with the fall NASCAR racing weekend at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Blaise Alexander was killed in a two-car incident while battling for the lead in the final laps of the race. Coincidentally, the other driver racing for Alexander for the lead was Dale Earnhardt's oldest son Kerry Earnhardt. The younger Earnhardt's car flipped on its roof after Alexander went into the wall, but he was in the lead when the race was halted with four laps to go. Due to carnage of the accident, the race was never restarted, so Earnhardt was declared the winner. NASCAR mandated use of the HANS device in its top three series on October 17, 2001. Formula One mandated HANS devices in 2003 after extensive testing by Mercedes from 1996 to 1998, sharing the results with other Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) affiliates. Using that information, CART made the device compulsory for oval tracks in 2001, and subsequently requiring the HANS devices for all circuits the following season. Starting in October 2001, NASCAR mandated either the HANS or Hutchens device head and neck restraint be used, going with the HANS device exclusively starting in 2005. Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) followed suit in the wake of a fatality in an ARCA race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in October 2001 that claimed the life of Blaise Alexander. The World Rally Championship and Australian V8 Supercar Series made the device compulsory for drivers in the 2005 season. Acceptance by drivers was helped by the addition of quick- release shackles developed and implemented by Ashley Tilling. They were sourced from the marine industry, being used on racing sailboat rigging. The shackles allowed the drivers a simple and quick pull to release the HANS device and exit their vehicle. The first driver to utilize them was NASCAR driver Scott Pruett of PPI Motorsports. Such shackles were also used on the Hutchens device and others. Beginning in July 2007, many sanctioning bodies have approved any head-and-neck restraint that passes the SFI Foundation Specification 38.1 standard. These include the HANS device, the Moto-R Sport, the R3, the Hutch-II, the Hutchens Hybrid, or the Hybrid X. Today, most major auto racing sanctioning bodies mandate the use of head and neck restraints; the FIA has made HANS devices use compulsory for all International-level events from the beginning of 2009. Even monster truck drivers use the HANS device in many events. Grassroots Motorsports awarded the HANS device the Editors' Choice award in 2002. Autosport magazine also awarded HANS their pioneering and innovation award in 2007. ==References== *Schilke, Nancy (2001). \\"The HANS Device – a head and neck support system\\", referenced January 23, 2005. *Stonefeld, Ross (2001). \\"Helping HANS\\" ==External links== *Official site *HANS from f1.com *\\"Helping HANS\\" at Atlas F1 *\\"Notes: Wallace easing into new HANS device\\" at NASCAR.com *Head and neck restraint at Trackpedia *HANS in F1 *HANS from f1.com *Nick Heidfeld's HANS device and helmet *Interview with Dr. Bob Hubbard *Motorized version of HANS at Sparkfun \\"Mechanek, interview with Mark Gallagher\\", (September 8, 2015) Category:Auto racing equipment Category:Vehicle safety technologies Category:Safety in auto racing ","title":"HANS device"},{"id":"1423597","text":"The Comedy Channel (promoted on air as comedy) was an Australian subscription television channel available on Foxtel, and Optus Television.

The new phrase introduces a meaning that is different from the original but plausible in the same context, such as \\"old-timers' disease\\" for \\"Alzheimer's disease\\". An eggcorn can be described as an intra-lingual phono- semantic matching, a matching in which the intended word and substitute are from the same language. Together with other types of same-sounding phrases, eggcorns are sometimes also referred to \\"oronyms\\". ==Etymology== The term eggcorn, as used to refer to this kind of substitution, was coined by professor of linguistics Geoffrey Pullum in September 2003 in response to an article by Mark Liberman on the website Language Log, a blog for linguists. Liberman discussed the case of a woman who substitutes the phrase egg corn for the word acorn, and he argued that the precise phenomenon lacked a name. Pullum suggested using eggcorn itself as a label. ==Similar phenomena== An eggcorn differs from a malapropism, the latter being a substitution that creates a nonsensical phrase. Classical malapropisms generally derive their comic effect from the fault of the user, while eggcorns are substitutions that exhibit creativity, logic or ignorance. Eggcorns often involve replacing an unfamiliar, archaic, or obscure word with a more common or modern word (\\"baited breath\\" for \\"bated breath\\"). LexisNexis link The phenomenon is similar to the form of wordplay known as the pun except that, by definition, the speaker or writer intends the pun to have some humorous effect on the recipient, whereas one who speaks or writes an eggcorn is often unaware. It is also similar to, but differs from, a mondegreen or a folk etymology. == Examples == *ex-patriot instead of expatriate *for all intensive purposes instead of for all intents and purposes *on the spurt of the moment instead of on the spur of the moment *preying mantis instead of praying mantis == See also == * Hypercorrection * Mumpsimus == References == == Further reading == * * * Liberman, Mark, and Geoffrey K.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Državna Tiskarna, p. 120.) is a town in Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Vrhnika. It is located on the Ljubljanica River, 21 km from Ljubljana along the A1 motorway. ==Geography== Big Drnovica Collapse Sinkhole Vrhnika lies at the southwest end of the Ljubljana Marsh near the sources of the Ljubljanica River, where the Ljubljana Basin opens up between the foot of Ljubljana Peak (, ) and Ulovka Hill (). The territory of the town extends south onto the Logatec Plateau (), where the Big and Little Drnovica Collapse Sinkholes () are found.Čepon, Barbara. 2010. Vrednotenje naravnih znamenitosti v Občini Vrhnika za turistično rabo. Bachelor's thesis. Ljubljana: Biotehniška fakulteta, Oddelek za krajinsko arhitekturo, p. 25. A rich network of springs and streams originates and joins near the town to form the source of the Ljubljanica. ==Name== The settlement at the location of today's Vrhnika was attested in antiquity as Nauportus in Latin, and as Ναύποντος and Νάμπορτος in Greek. Medieval attestations of the name include de superiory Laybaco in 1300, Oberlaybach in 1308 (and Ober Laybach in 1309), and Vernich in 1481, corresponding to the modern Slovene name. In the past, the town was known as Oberlaibach in standard German. The Slovene name is probably a compound of vrh 'top, summit' + nika or nikve 'creek, spring', referring to the source of the Ljubljanica River. The Latin name Nauportus is a compound of navis 'boat' + portus 'transfer', referring to a place where cargo had to be transferred from boats to pack animals or carts along a trade route. A mythological reinterpretation of the Latin name as referring to the portage of a boat itself (specifically, the Argo) appears in Pliny the Elder's Natural History.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, pp. 468–469. ==History== In Roman times, Nauportus was an important communication point.Curk I. et al. (1993). In the footsteps of Roman soldiers in Slovenia. Ljubljana: Zavod Republike Slovenije za varstvo naravne in kulturne dediščine Slovenije. Vrhnika as it exists today started to develop in the High Middle Ages. Vrhnika became a market town and was among the wealthiest towns in CarniolaJohann Weikhard von Valvasor: The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, published 1689, translated extracts published 1984 by Mladinska knjiga, pp. 240, 241. up to the early 18th century, when it started to lose importance. Nevertheless, it remained one of main transportation junctions in Inner Austria because of its strategic location on the crossroads between the trade routes from Trieste to Vienna and from Rijeka to Klagenfurt.Orožen Adamič M., Perko D., Kladnik D. (1995). Krajevni leksikon Slovenije. Ljubljana: DZS. The development of the town was strongly impaired by the construction of the Austrian Southern Railway in the 1840s, which bypassed it. From then on, it started losing importance, becoming a satellite town of Ljubljana, which has remained up to this day. ===Mass grave=== Pikec Valley Mass Grave Vrhnika is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Pikec Valley Mass Grave () is located at the bottom of a sinkhole southwest of the town, on Sveč Hill near the Vojc house. It contains the remains of six German prisoners of war that were murdered in May 1945.Dežman, Jože. 2009.

Portrait by an unknown artist (posthumously, c. 1600) Philipp von Hutten (18 December 1505 – 17 May 1546) was a German adventurer, and an early European explorer of Venezuela. He is a significant figure in the history of Klein-Venedig (1528 - 1546), the concession of Venezuela Province to the Welser banking family by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. ==Biography== Hutten was born in Königshofen, Lower Franconia.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277686/Philipp-von-Hutten He passed some of his early years at the court of the Roman emperor Charles V. Charles granted the province of Venezuela (or Venosala as Hutten calls it), to the Welser family of Augsburg. ===Early exploration of Venezuela, 1535-1538=== Hutten joined a band of 600 adventurers, under Georg von Speyer, who sailed out to conquer and exploit the province in the family's interest. The party landed at Coro in February 1535 and Hutten accompanied von Speyer on his long and difficult expedition into the interior in search of treasure (El Dorado). Subsequently, Hutten accompanied Speyer on a journey (1536–38) in which they reached the headwaters of the Japurá River, near the equator. ===Journey to Los Llanos, 1541-1546=== After the death of von Speyer in June, 1540, Hutten became governor (captain-general) of Venezuela in December. He left Coro on 1 August, 1541 with a force of about 150 men, mostly horsemen. He initially followed the path of Speyer, but crossed the Rio Bermejo, and went on with a small group of around 40 men on horseback into the Llanos. There he engaged in battle with a large number of Omaguas and was severely wounded. ===Capture and execution=== Inspection of the Welser army by Georg von Speyer (right) and von Hutten (center) at Sanlúcar de Barrameda. In autumn 1544, weakened by hunger and fever, he and his followers who survived returned to Coro. About 100 miles away from the city, he was captured and killed just before Easter, 1546 by the Spaniard Juan de Carvajal. Carvajal had in 1545 been appointed Captain-General of Venezuela by the Audiencia of Santo Domingo and feared the loss of his position upon Hutten's return.\\"Hutten, Philipp (Felipe Dutre, de Utre, de Ure), Conquistador, 1511 - 24.4.1546 in Venezuela.\\" Deutsche Biographie As the years had gone by with no news of Hutten and his followers, Carvajal had begun to feel secure in his position, and the return of the adventurers was not welcome to him. When he saw how few they were, he thought to force from them an acknowledgment of his authority. He was unsuccessful, and a subsequent attempt to seize them proved disastrous, for he was wounded by a traveling companion of Hutten's, Bartholomeus VI. Welser (the younger). Carvajal was forced to pledge the Germans safe passage. In their journey to the coast, the adventurers took no precautions against attack, and were easily captured by Carvajal in April 1546, who, after keeping Hutten and Welser in chains for a time, had them beheaded. Eight years after Hutten's death, the Welsers' grant was taken from them, and German rule in Venezuela ceased. ==Works== Hutten left some letters, and also a narrative of the earlier part (1535 to 1546) of his adventures. The manuscript was brought to Germany, and lay so long in a library that it became almost illegible. It was finally published in the first volume of a collection entitled Literary and Historical Magazine by Meusel (Bayreuth and Leipzig, 1785). It bears the title \\"News from the Indies from Junker Philipp Hutten\\" () and contains information on the events in which the author took part while giving graphic descriptions of the countries through which he passed. ==Family== He was a relative of Ulrich von Hutten. ==Literary allusions== In 1983, Venezuelan author Francisco Herrera-Luque (1927–1991) published the novel La Luna de Fausto (Faust's Moon) narrating the adventures of von Hutten (called Felipe de Utre in old Spanish accounts) in a journey from Europe to wild American territories in the 16th century, until beheaded by Juan de Carvajal over a power dispute. According to the legend, his death was prophetized by Dr. Faust himself, who foretold he was going to die under a \\"red moon\\". ==Notes== ==References== *Von Hutten, Philipp Zeitung aus India Junkher Philipps von Hutten 1785. *Chapman, Walker The Golden Dream: Seekers of El Dorado.

Sugar refinery in Arabi, Louisiana, United States. Groningen, The Netherlands A sugar refinery is a refinery which processes raw sugar into white refined sugar or that processes sugar beet to refined sugar. Many cane sugar mills produce raw sugar, which is sugar that still contains molasses, giving it more colour (and impurities) than the white sugar which is normally consumed in households and used as an ingredient in soft drinks and foods. While cane sugar does not need refining to be palatable, sugar from sugar beet is almost always refined to remove the strong, usually unwanted, taste of beets from it. The refined sugar produced is more than 99 percent pure sucrose. Whereas many sugar mills only operate during a limited time of the year during the cane harvesting period, other cane sugar refineries work the whole year round. Sugar beet refineries tend to have shorter periods when they process beet but may store intermediate product and process that in the off-season. Raw sugar is either processed into white refined sugar in local refineries, and sold to the local industry and consumers, or it is exported and refined in the country of destination. Sugar refineries date back to Arab Egypt in the 12th century. An artisanal version is the trapiche, later substituted by the engenho or . Sugar refineries are often located in heavy sugar-consuming regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. Since the 1990s, many state-of-the art sugar refineries have been built in the Middle East and North Africa region, e.g. in Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Algeria. The world´s largest sugar refinery company is American Sugar Refining with facilities in North America and Europe. ==Raw sugar processing== ===Affination=== Raw sugar storage in a sugar refinery The raw sugar is stored in large warehouses and then transported into the sugar refinery by means of transport belts. In the traditional refining process, the raw sugar is first mixed with heavy syrup and centrifuged to wash away the outer coating of the raw sugar crystals, which is less pure than the crystal interior. Many sugar refineries today buy high pol sugar and can do without the affination process. ===Screening=== The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup (about 70 percent by weight solids), which is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide that combine to precipitate calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others, and then float to the top of the tank, where they are skimmed off. After any remaining solids are filtered out, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through the use of bone char, which is made from the bones of cattle, a bed of activated carbon or, in more modern plants, ion- exchange resin. ==Sugar house== Vacuum pans Continuous sugar centrifugal for recovery products The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized under vacuum to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging. To produce granulated sugar, in which the individual sugar grains do not clump together, sugar must be dried. ==Sugar drying and storage== Drying is accomplished first by drying the sugar in a hot rotary dryer, and then by blowing cool air through it for several days in conditioning silos. The finished product is stored in large concrete or steel silos. It is shipped in bulk, big bags or 25 – 50 kg bags to industrial customers or packed in consumer-size packages to retailers. The dried sugar must be handled with caution, as sugar dust explosions are possible. For example, a sugar dust explosion which led to 13 fatalities was the 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion in Port Wentworth, GA. ==Byproducts== *Molasses *Bagasse *Press Mud ==Factory automation in sugar refineries== As in many other industries factory automation has been promoted heavily in sugar refineries in recent decades. The production process is generally controlled by a central process control system, which directly controls most of the machines and components. Only for certain special machines such as the centrifuges in the sugar house decentralized PLCs are used for security reasons. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *Sugar related online glossary. *Sugar refining. *Centrifugal control and the quality of white sugar by Barbara Rogé et. al., retrieved on 27 June, 2010.

Very little is known for certain about Eanred. The only reference made by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to the Northumbrians in this period is the statement that in 829 Egbert of Wessex \\"led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home\\",The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, trans. James Henry Ingram (London: Everyman Press, 1912). Whilst the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle assigns these events to 827, the lunar eclipse referred to in the same entry occurred in the winter of 828-29, and it is accepted that the correct year for Eanred's meeting with Egbert is 829. thereby, at least temporarily, extending Egbert's hegemony to the entirety of Anglo-Saxon Britain. Roger of Wendover states that Eanred reigned from 810 until 840, the twelfth-century History of the Church of Durham records a reign of 33 years, and a recently discovered coin of Eanred has been dated to c. 850 on stylistic grounds. Given the turbulence of Northumbrian history in this period, a reign of this length suggests a figure of some significance. Within a generation of Eanred's death, Anglian monarchy in Northumbria had collapsed. Egbert at Dore Eanred was the son of King Eardwulf, who was deposed by an otherwise unknown Ælfwald in 806. According to the History of the Church of Durham, Ælfwald ruled for two years before Eanred succeeded. However, Frankish sources claim that, after being expelled from England, Eardwulf was received by Charlemagne and then the pope, and that their envoys escorted him back to Northumbria and secured his restoration to power. Therefore the precise nature of the succession of Eanred is unclear. All sources agree that Eanred was eventually succeeded by his son, Æthelred. Copper styca of King Eanred Eanred's reign sees the appearance of the styca, a new style of small coin which replaced the earlier sceat. These stycas were of low silver content, later coins being effectively brass. Produced in York, large numbers have survived and several moneyers are named on the surviving coins, suggesting that they were minted in significant quantities. Higham estimates that hundreds of thousands of stycas were in circulation. The distribution of the coin finds suggests that their principal use was in external trade and that, apart from the payment of taxes, coins were little used by the great majority of Northumbrians in daily life. ==Footnotes== ==References== * Higham, N.J., The Kingdom of Northumbria AD 350-1100 (Stroud: Sutton, 1993). * Kirby, D.P., The Earliest English Kings (London: Unwin Hyman, 1991). * ==External links== * * The Fitzwilliam Museum's Corpus of Early Medieval Coin Finds website Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Anglo-Saxon warriors Category:Northumbrian monarchs Category:9th-century English monarchs ","title":"Eanred of Northumbria"},{"id":"1423631","text":"is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up by Sigma Entertainment that was released only in Japan for Family Computer in 1991.

Honda Insight IMA, 2009. Integrated Motor Assist (commonly abbreviated as IMA) is Honda's hybrid car technology, introduced in 1999 on the Insight. It is a specific implementation of a parallel hybrid. It uses an electric motor mounted between the internal combustion engine and transmission to act as a starter motor, engine balancer, and assist traction motor. ==Overview== In its first generation, IMA could not power the car on electricity alone, and could only use the motor to assist or start the engine. The 2006 Civic Hybrid, however, can activate the electric motor while the vehicle is coasting without turning on the internal combustion engine, though in contrast to Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) or General Motors and DaimlerChrysler's Global Hybrid Cooperation, the IMA has a less powerful motor/generator which allows the car to slow or stop its rate of deceleration to a lesser extent; it cannot operate without turning over the engine which is directly coupled to its electric motor. ==Regenerative braking== The IMA uses regenerative braking to capture some of the energy that would otherwise be lost to heating during deceleration, and reuse that energy later to help accelerate the vehicle. This has three effects: it increases the rate of acceleration, reduces the work required of the engine, and reduces the frequency of brake hardware replacement. The acceleration boost is important as it allows the engine to be scaled down to a smaller but more fuel-efficient variant without rendering the vehicle unacceptably slow or weak. This smaller engine is the primary reason cars equipped with IMA get better highway mileage than their more conventional counterparts. ==Starting== Additionally, vehicles equipped with IMA can shut off their engine when the vehicle stops and use the electric motor to rapidly spin it back up when the driver releases the brake pedal (or in the manual transmission variant, when the shifter is placed into gear from neutral). They also have a conventional starter as a backup, making it the only production hybrid system which can operate with its high voltage electric system disabled, using only its engine like a traditional vehicle. However, since the IMA also acts as the vehicle's alternator, eventually the 12 volt accessory battery would require an external charge. ==Other names== *ISG: Integrated Starter Generator *ISA: Integrated Starter Alternator *ISAD: Integrated Starter Alternator Damper *CAS: Combined Alternator Starter *CSA: Crankshaft Starter Alternator or Combined Starter Alternator *CISG: Crank- mounted Integrated Starter Generator ==List of vehicles using IMA== IMA- equipped Honda Civic Hybrid *Honda J-VX (1997 concept car) *Honda Insight (1999-2006, 2010-2014) *Honda Dualnote (2001 concept car) *Honda Fit Hybrid (2010-present) *Honda Fit Shuttle Hybrid (2010-present) *Honda Civic Hybrid (2003-2015) *Honda Accord Hybrid (2005-2007) *Honda Freed Hybrid (2008-present) *Honda CR-Z (2010-2016) *Acura ILX Hybrid (2013-2014) ==References== ==External links== *Honda Official \\"Green Technology - Hybrid\\" Category:Automotive technology tradenames Category:Engine technology Category:Honda Category:Hybrid powertrain de: Honda Civic IMA ","title":"Integrated Motor Assist"},{"id":"1423633","text":"The Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh () is a diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), covering the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. Since 18 December 2018, the diocese is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe. The diocese's name is taken from an ancient see in the Crimea that no longer has a bishop. The patron saint of the diocese is St Stephen of Sourozh, an eighth-century Archbishop of Sourozh (today Sudak) and Confessor of the Faith during the Iconoclastic Controversy. Founded in October 1962, the diocese was headed by Metropolitan Anthony (Bloom) until his death in 2003. Since the adoption of its new statutes in 2010, the Diocese was placed under the direct and personal spiritual and administrative authority of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. Since 28 December 2018, the Diocese of Sourozh is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe. ==History== === Origins of the Diocese === Russian Orthodox Patriarchial Church of The Assumption of All Saints The origins of the Diocese of Sourozh lie in the Parish of the Dormition in London, which from 1716 existed as the Russian Embassy Church. In that year, Archimandrite Gennadius rented a house in Exchange Court, an alley leading off The Strand and converted the large drawing room into a church. The Anglican Bishop of London, John Robinson, agreed to allow Orthodox worship at the church, with the stipulation that the services remained private, that English people were excluded and that singing should not be loud \\"lest common crowds cause any harm\\". The first service was held in November 1716 on the Feast of the Presentation of Mary. Although small, the congregation included Russian diplomats, and Russian and Greek merchants, there being no Greek church in London until 1838. Over the following century, a dozen English families also joined the church, as did Colonel Philip Ludwell III, a wealthy American colonist who was received into Orthodoxy in 1738. Another notable English member was the linguist John Paradise, a Fellow of the Royal Society.Sarni 2012, pp. 13-15 By 1756, the church had fallen into disrepair, and Exchange Court had degenerated into \\"a disreputable and shameful place\\" frequented by prostitutes. Therefore, another large house was rented in Burlington Gardens, again with the drawing room converted for worship.Sarni 2012, p. 17 During the Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812), the rector of the church became Russia's sole diplomatic representative in London.Sarni 2012, p. 25 The church made a further two moves, in 1784 to Great Portland Street and in 1813 to a large terraced house at 32 Welbeck Street. Here, a chapel was built in the rear of the house on the site of the stables, which was itself rebuilt in the late 1860s and is now a listed building, although no longer a place of Orthodox worship.Sarni 2012, p. 33 From 1920, the Anglican church of St Mary-le-Bow in the City of London, allowed the growing Russian congregation to worship there on Sundays and feast days, and in 1921 the Church of England offered a redundant church building, St Philip’s, in Buckingham Palace Road, which, like its predecessors, was consecrated as the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God.Sarni 2012, p. 45 In 1955, the site of St Philip’s Church was purchased for the construction of an extension to Victoria Coach Station. After long negotiations the parish was offered a disused Anglican church in Knightsbridge, All Saints' Church, Ennismore Gardens, which is now the Dormition Cathedral, London.Sarni 2012, p. 57 The jurisdictional history of the parish in the years following the Russian Revolution is complicated. Immediately following the Russian Revolution the parish was under the jurisdiction of what would become known as the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). In 1926, however, the parish split into those who continued to support ROCOR and those who supported the Moscow Patriarchate. Each group took services in turn. Then, in 1931, the parish was taken into the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1945 the parish followed its bishop, Metropolitan Evlogii, who wished to move back into the Moscow Patriarchate but on the condition that he would need a release from the Ecumenical Patriarch – which was applied for, but never granted.Metropolite Euolge, Le Chemin de ma Vie, Paris, 2005, page 554 In 1948 Hieromonk Anthony (Bloom) was appointed Chaplain of the Anglican-Orthodox Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius. On 1 September 1950 Hieromonk Anthony became the Rector of the Russian Parish of the Dormition in London. But by that time, the Parish of the Dormition was not the only Russian Orthodox parish in Great Britain, as a number of other parishes appeared, set up by Russian Orthodox communities. This prompted, in 1957, the formation in Great Britain of the Vicariate of Sergievo of the Exarchate of Western Europe (Moscow Patriarchate), with Hieromonk Anthony now becoming Bishop of Sergievo. Following this, on 10 October 1962, the Diocese of Sourozh was formed, led by Bishop Anthony of Sergievo, who then became Archbishop Anthony of Sourozh. The Russian Church did not name the diocese after a British territory so as not to upset good relations with the Church of England.See Gillian Crow, This Holy Man: Impressions of Metropolitan Anthony (London: DLT, 2005), 132–33 for details. For many years, Gillian Crow has been the Secretary of the Diocese of Sourozh's Diocesan Assembly. ===Distinctive ethos of the diocese=== For many years the political situation between Great Britain and the Soviet Union meant that the Diocese of Sourozh was able to function in virtual independence of the Moscow Patriarchate. In those years it developed its own distinctive ethos and liturgical practices. Thus, in contrast to the typical practice of the Russian Orthodox Church, in Sourozh marriages may take place on a Saturday, frequent communion is common, confession is not considered necessary before each communion, fasting rules are observed less strictly than is often the case in the Russian Orthodox Church and women are not required to wear headscarves in church and may wear trousers rather than skirts.http://www.sourozh.org/info/docs/commission_en.html Also distinctive of the Sourozh diocese has been the stipulation in its diocesan statutes according to which the Sourozh diocesan assembly has the right to determine what bishops can be appointed to the diocese (it is standard in the Russian Orthodox Church for bishops to be appointed directly by the Holy Synod without necessarily having to consult the diocese in question). These particularities were legitimated within the diocese upon the basis of the decrees of the All- Russian Church Council of 1917–1918, in accordance with which the statutes of the Diocese of Sourozh were written. The Moscow Patriarchate, however, has never formally accepted these statutes, so in legal terms they are in effect without any force. Throughout its existence, the diocese has remained predominantly located in southern England. It has not expanded substantially into the north of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, though increasing numbers of Russian Orthodox Christians located in these areas of Great Britain and Ireland.http://www.sourozh.org/info/docs/BB2Patr240406_en.html The Diocese has been centred on the Cathedral in London and the Parish in Oxford, with the episcopacy residing in these locations. The culture of the diocese reflected both the Franco-Russian emigre Orthodoxy in which Metropolitan Anthony had spent many of his formative years, as well as the middle-to-high Anglicanism which formed the ecclesial background of many of the English converts to the diocese.The form of this culture may be seen in Crow, This Holy Man, passim. Many in the diocese had a long-term vision of the establishment of an autocephalous (self-governed) Orthodox Church in Great Britain.See Crow, This Holy Man, p. 173 Metropolitan Anthony himself maintained links with the Moscow Patriarchate to the end of his life. And whilst the Diocese of Sourozh was numerically far smaller than the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain (the local British Diocese of the Ecumenical Patriarchate), Metropolitan Anthony considered the Diocese of Sourozh to be \\"the Orthodox Church in Britain\\" simpliciter, on the grounds that it was open to all and not only to those of a particular ethnic background (as he took the Diocese of Thyateira to be).Crow, This Holy Man, p. 133. However, some traditionalist ROCOR criticised the Sourozh diocese for endorsing \\"'an Anglican form of Orthodoxy\\", led by \\"a small and ageing clique of intellectuals, very much part of one particular, upper middle-class, Western cultural elitist group, one elderly generation\\". ===Influx into the diocese after the fall of the Soviet Union=== With the fall of communism in Russia, a new wave of Russian Orthodox parishioners entered the diocese. Many amongst this group, attending the diocesan cathedral in London, were unhappy at the (for a Russian Church) non- standard practices which prevailed in the diocese, and sought to bring its liturgical practices and ethos into line with the standard practice of the Russian Orthodox Church. For the supporters of such change, this amounted to 'normalisation'; for its opponents, it constituted Russification. It has been alleged by British ROCOR clergy that the diocese of Sourozh failed to expand to meet the spiritual needs of newly arrived Orthodox Christians from Russia who lived in areas of the United Kingdom in which the diocese did not have parishes or communities. Such allegations have been confirmed by the commission of the Holy Synod, which has concluded that in recent years \\"there were not enough Russian-speaking priests in the parish to celebrate services and, in particular, to confess, that English was gradually used more and more as a liturgical language, and that this was disproportionate to the actual number of English people at the Cathedral\\". === Tensions === The diocese's history with its hierarchs, and the relations between those hierarchs, have at times been tumultuous, with bishops Hilarion (Alfeyev) being moved away from the diocese, and Basil (Osborne) leaving the Russian Orthodox Patriarchate to join the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Metropolitan Anthony had spoken about, and sometimes become involved in, these tensions. These often related to jurisdictional disputes, neglect of country parishes,https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://orthodoxnews.evenworks.net/doodad.fcgi?tcode=10&story;=editorial12082002164617.shtml or to the rift between pro-Moscow laity and those who advanced the ideal of an autocephalous Orthodox church in Great Britain. === Bishop Basil's departure to Constantinople === In January 2002, Hilarion (Alfeyev) was consecrated Bishop of Kerch as an assistant bishop for the Sourozh diocese, assuming the title previously held by Archbishop Anatoly who was sent into retirement for the purpose. According to the Russian Orthodox Church, initially, Bishop Hilarion was well accepted by the diocese as a whole. But soon, Bishop Basil and others in the diocese claimed that Bishop Hilarion was, on the direction of senior clergy in the ROC, undermining Metropolitan Anthony in order to increase the ROC's control over the diocese. Suspicions were voiced regarding the manner of Bishop Hilarion's appointment and the manner of his leadership following his appointment. Bishop Hilarion later named those whom he took to be the leaders of this group. Metropolitan Anthony's opposition to the group seeking to undermine and destroy the Diocese of Sourozh is forcefully expressed in an address he made to his London Parish on 12 December 2002 which has been recorded. During this period, Bishop Basil and others began to suggest that, should relations with the Moscow Patriarchate worsen, then the members of the Diocese of Sourozh would change jurisdiction by leaving the Russian Orthodox Church and joining the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Subsequently, Bishop Basil also claimed that, with the full knowledge of Metropolitan Anthony, 'letters of dismissal' were prepared for clergy of the Diocese of Sourozh, to enable them to transfer out of the Diocese to another jurisdiction. However, several of the closest and most trusted assistants of Metropolitan Anthony claim to have had no knowledge of this. On 24 April 2006, Bishop Basil decided to write to the Patriarch of Moscow asking that he, and those who wished to follow him, be released from the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate that they may be received into the Patriarchate of Constantinople. On 9 May 2006, Patriarch Alexy II issued a decree saying Osborne was relieved of his duties as administrator of the Diocese of Sourozh. On 8 June 2006, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate responded to Bishop Basil's appeal. The synod unanimously agreed to receive Bishop Basil, giving him the new title of Bishop of Amphipolis. As Bishop of Amphipolis, Osborne was appointed assistant bishop within the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Archdiocese of Parishes of the Russian Tradition in Western Europe (i.e. the 'Exarchate'), under the headship of Archbishop Gabriel of Comana. In his brief time as assistant bishop in the Exarchate, Basil's authority was over a newly formed vicariate of parishes in the British Isles who had followed him in his departure from the Russian Orthodox Church into the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This body was given the title Episcopal Vicariate of Great Britain and Ireland, and consisted of some twelve parishes and some smaller Eucharistic Communities. In March 2007, negotiations took place in Geneva between representatives of the two patriarchates (Moscow and Constantinople). These concluded with the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate releasing Osborne from its jurisdiction on 27 March. Commenting to the media on the synod's decision, Metropolitan Kyrill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department of External Church Relations, said that \\"The problem arose because Bishop Basil went over to Constantinople without any request from Constantinople and without any consent from the Moscow Patriarchate. Now Constantinople has requested his documents, which customarily include a letter of release. This means that the Moscow Patriarchate has granted Bishop Basil a canonical leave.\\" == Recent events == ===Fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the cathedral=== On 15 October 2006 the Diocese of Sourozh celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the consecration of the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God and all Saints. Joining the Diocese for this special event were Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad, Archbishop , Archbishop Theofan of Berlin and Germany, as well as Bishop Hilarion (Alfeyev).The Russian Church in London: From Peter the Great to the Present Day Page 71. Downloaded 18 March 2018. In his message to the faithful of the Diocese for that occasion, Patriarch Alexy of Moscow and All Russia stressed that the Cathedral is home to a \\"'multitudinous and multilingual flock\\", and that this is quite proper for the Church, being \\"a single body made up of many and dissimilar members, filled with one Spirit\\". Alexy exhorted the members of the Diocese to 'bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ\\" (Gal. 6:2). He hoped that the celebrations would contribute to the \\"healing\\" of the \\"wounds\\" inflicted upon the Diocese in recent times. ===Consecration of Bishop Elisey of Bogorodsk=== On 26 November 2006, Archimandrite Elisey (Ganaba) was consecrated Bishop of Bogorodsk at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, to be assistant bishop to Archbishop , with pastoral responsibility for the Diocese of Sourozh. At his consecration, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and all Russia laid upon him three tasks.http://www.sourozh.org/info/news/Patr261103_en.html *'First of all, above all other tasks, however great and urgent they may be', Bishop Elisey is to 'face the daily and unceasing task of caring for each child of God, for whom Christ died'. *Secondly, Bishop Elisey is 'to witness to the truth of the Orthodox faith before all the peoples of the West, working to strengthen it, with the ultimate aim of reuniting all in the One, Holy, and Apostolic Church'. *Thirdly, Bishop Elisey is 'to give spiritual support' to Russians ('our compatriots') who 'now live in Great Britain'. ===Wonderworking icon brought by the diocese to Great Britain=== The Derzhavnaya (Reigning) Icon of the Mother of God was brought to Britain by the Diocese of Sourozh in September 2007 with the stated blessing of Patriarch Alexy. ===Bishop Elisey appointed as Bishop of Sourozh=== On 27 December 2007 the Holy Synod appointed Bishop Elisey as Bishop of Sourozh, bringing to an end the Temporary Administration of , who was thanked for having restored peace to the Diocese. ===Matthew as diocesan bishop=== By the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church of 28 December 2017, Archbishop Elisey of Sourozh was relieved of the administration of the Diocese of Sourozh and appointed Archbishop of The Hague and the Netherlands. In the same decision, of Bogorodsk was relieved of his duties as Administrator of the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Italy and appointed as ruling Bishop of the diocese of Sourozh. === Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe === Since 28 December 2018, the Diocese of Sourozh is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe. == Ruling bishops == * Anthony of Sourozh (10 October 1962-?) *Basil of Sergievo (August 2003-9 May 2006) * (May 2006-27 December 2007) locum tenens * Elisey (Ganaba) (27 December 2007 – 28 December 2017) * (28 December 2017-) On 6 October 2006, the Holy Synod of the ROC announced that Archimandrite Elisey (Ganaba), head of the Russian Spiritual Mission in Jerusalem, was to be consecrated Bishop of Bogorodsk, assistant bishop of the Diocese of Korsun, with responsibility for the administration of the Diocese of Sourozh. ==External links== *Official site of the Diocese of Sourozh *Official site of the Episcopal Vicariate of Great Britain and Ireland of the Exarchate of Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe of the Ecumenical Patriarchate *Information about the diocese on the official website of the ROC ==References== Category:Eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in the United Kingdom Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in the Republic of Ireland Category:Eastern Orthodox dioceses in Europe Category:Christian organizations established in 1962 ","title":"Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh"},{"id":"1423636","text":"Kaleida Labs formed in 1991 to produce the multimedia cross-platform Kaleida Media Player and the object oriented scripting language ScriptX that was used to program its behavior. The system was aimed at the production of interactive CD ROM titles, an area of major effort in the early 1990s. When the system was delivered in 1994, it had relatively high system requirements and memory footprint, and lacked a native PowerPC version on the Mac platform. Around the same time, rapid changes in the market, especially the expansion of the World Wide Web and the Java programming language, pushed the interactive CD market into a niche role. The Kaleida platform failed to gain significant traction and the company was closed in 1996. Kaleida was one of three joint ventures of the 1990s between Apple and IBM, including the Taligent operating system and the AIM alliance with Motorola for the PowerPC platform. ScriptX was one of several similar software platforms that started at Apple in that timeframe. The SK8 system was also aimed at the multimedia market, although it evolved from what was originally a major upgrade to HyperCard. The Dylan programming language was a more full-featured platform, aimed at general programming not just multimedia. Development of all of these software projects ended at approximately the same time. ==History== ===Formation=== Announced in 1991, the company began operations in the summer of 1992 with Nat Goldhaber serving as its first CEO.Lawrence Fisher, \\"Apple-I.B.M. Venture Chief Is Named\\", New York Times, June 24, 1992 The company was staffed by hand picking members of Apple's QuickTime team, along with members from the big-iron content delivery side at IBM.\\"Strep Throat\\", \\"Infant Mortality and Other Tragedies\\", suck.com, November 22, 1995 Kaleida's corporate offices were located in Mountain View, California, at sites near the Shoreline Amphitheater on the east side of U.S. 101. Kaleida was one of the earliest companies to post a corporate website. The early model for the system was the Kaleida Media Player, or KMP. This was essentially a cross-platform interactive version of the QuickTime Player that would run on the Apple Macintosh, IBM PC clones, as well as set-top boxes and other platforms. It was intended to be a single universal multimedia system. On top of this model was the ScriptX programming language and object library, which allowed developers to make the media files completely interactive. According to statements made at the Digital World Conference, Goldhaber stated that ScriptX would allow developers to distribute their work on practically any device simply by “hitting a button on a screen and selecting ‘Save as ScriptX’.\\"Janice Maloney, \\"A Multimedia Standard to Bring About ‘Universal Compatibility’\\" , Digital Media, July 1993 Grandiose statements were typical, with Goldhaber later stating that \\"It actually does have some genuine social importance.\\"Jonathan Weber, \\"Kaleida Labs, an Apple-IBM joint venture, is searching for ways to develop multimedia technologies.\\", Los Angeles Times, September 27, 1992 Goldhaber's flamboyant style, expensive company payroll, and lack of obvious progress led to negative stories in the press. One executive who described that \\"the company has spent about $20 million in its one year of existence and that Apple and IBM are loath to continue spending money at that rate. He said Kaleida salaries are high and that the company has too many employees for its current stage of development\\".Jonathan Weber, \\"Kaleida's multimedia labs will be run by an IBM veteran amid reports of delays and high costs\\", Los Angeles Times, July 16, 1993 In early 1993, Goldhaber and the board started fighting over stock options and whether the company should go public. On July 18, 1993 the company announced that Goldhaber was being replaced as CEO by Mike Braun, formerly of IBM. The company stated that Goldhaber would remain on the board in efforts to build industry partnerships, but blamed a lack of progress on this front, and Goldhaber's \\"hands off\\" management, as the main reasons for the switch.Ralph King, \\"Multimedia Kaleida Shifts Top Executives Amid Delays\\", Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1993 In parting, Goldhaber quipped that different cultures and political maneuverings at IBM and Apple doomed the company from the start. ===Refocus and release=== Following Goldhaber's ousting, the company’s focus was narrowed. Plans to build a system for set-top boxes was officially abandoned in April 1994.Laurie Flynn, \\"Sound Bytes; Maverick Remakes Kaleida\\", The New York Times, May 15, 1994 Kaleida’s mission from then on was to complete and support the ScriptX language and multimedia object library, which by this point were very late. Kaleida sought to bundle the KMP as system software with new personal computers. At the same time, CD-ROM developers could ship the KMP with content to support existing Windows and Macintosh systems. As part of the new focus, the company was downsized, with layoffs representing about 20 to 25% of the workforce.Ray Valdés, \\"What's up at Kaleida?\\", Dr. Dobbs Developer Update, September 1, 1994 In late 1993 and early 1994, the company’s objective was for the Kaleida Media Player to run on a reference platform consisting of either a 25 MHz Motorola 68030 or a 25 MHz Intel 80486 processor running with 4 MB of random access memory. Such a system was typical of the installed base at that time, and most new computers were shipping with a read-only CD-ROM drive. Toshiba, which had supported Kaleida’s set-top box effort, became a minority stakeholder. Throughout its brief history, Kaleida maintained cross-platform development efforts for Windows (both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95), the Macintosh (supporting both the 68000 and PowerPC platforms), and OS/2. The ScriptX development kit and the 1.0 version of the Kaleida Media Player were finally released on December 19, 1994, now considerably late.\\"Kaleida Labs Ships ScriptS Multimedia Programs\\", New York Times, December 20, 1994 Nevertheless, reviews were generally positive, calling it \\"remarkable for its ease of use\\" and stating that the core \\"classes that provide a high common denominator feature set for ScriptX- based development\\". However, performance was another issue entirely. The 1.0 version of the KMP required 3.3 MB of RAM on Windows and 2.9 MB on the Mac, and this was for the basic runtime only, not the actual content that ran on it.Stephan Somogyi, \\"Kaleida's ScriptX: It's late but ahead of its time\\", Digital Media Perspective, December 23, 1994 To put this in perspective, a mid-range Mac of the era was the LC 475 which shipped with only 4 MB of RAM standard, of which the OS used a significant amount. Moreover, the system was not released in PowerPC format, although by this point the PPC had already formed the high end of the Mac lineup for eight months. ===Changing market=== Kaleida had been founded partly as an authoring environment for applications based on CD-ROMs. But the product life cycle of CD-ROMs, which had been heralded for years as a content delivery system, turned out to be surprisingly short. By 1995 it was becoming clear that the World Wide Web would be delivering many of the lightweight interactive systems that were previously delivered in CD-ROM, and while video and similar high-bandwidth systems were not yet suitable for the Web, they did not need the development environment or interactivity offered by something like Kaleida. Kaleida had also been formed, to some degree, to offer an alternative to the Wintel platform for what at that point appeared to be an emerging market in the CD world. Goldhaber had mentioned this on many occasions, describing the upcoming \\"war\\" for multimedia. After Netscape's public offering early in 1995, many software developers recognized that the browser itself would pose a challenge to Windows, and that the browser would become a multimedia platform in its own right. The standalone platform to attack Wintel now existed. Kaleida then started an effort to deliver objects over the Internet and deliver Web content.\\"ScriptX and the World Wide Web: Link Globally, Interact Locally\\" Most potential Kaleida developers had been taking a wait-and-watch approach to the system, waiting for Kaleida to solve performance problems and ship a more stable version of ScriptX. However, the company had not been able to demonstrate a system that ran acceptably in less than 16 MB of RAM, which was at that time the \\"high end\\" of the market. Macromedia's Director and associated Lingo program took advantage of the vacuum to establish a strong market. Meanwhile, Sun Microsystems was promoting its new Java programming language as a Web-dedicated system designed specifically to run on even the smallest platforms. ===Closure=== By late 1995 it was clear that ScriptX had lost its momentum in the market, even though the company was on the verge of shipping ScriptX Version 1.5. In November 1995, Apple Computer and IBM announced the closure of Kaleida Labs, effective in January 1996.Julie Pitta, \\"IBM, Apple Will Close Door on Kaleida Labs\\" Los Angeles Times, November 18, 1995 The parent companies announced that they would ship ScriptX 1.5 anyhow. Future development of ScriptX would move to a group inside Apple Computer, and Apple offered jobs to most members of the ScriptX engineering team. ScriptX Version 1.5 shipped almost concurrently with the closure of Kaleida Labs, in January 1996.Donald Emerick and Kimberlee Round, \\"Exploring Web Marketing and Project Management\\", MIT Press, p. 558 By shipping ScriptX, Apple and IBM met contractual commitments they had made to developers and avoided legal difficulties. Ultimately, only two multimedia content projects ever shipped using ScriptX 1.5. One was a CD-ROM version of the Swedish National Encyclopedia, Nationalencyklopedin, developed by Linné Data of Gothenburg, Sweden. The other was an interactive music title, Robert Winter's Crazy for Ragtime. ===After Kaleida=== Within a few months, development of ScriptX withered away inside Apple, and the remaining employees had either migrated to other jobs at Apple, or had left for other companies in the industry. The Director application remained a major force in the multimedia market for a time, but was supplanted and then replaced, by Flash. Early versions of Flash are in many ways a clone of ScriptX, using a small plug-in runtime with an event-driven language and similar resource requirements. ==Description== ===ScriptX=== The principal software architect of ScriptX was John Wainwright, an Australian-born computer scientist. ScriptX was implemented in C, using an extensive library called Objects in C that Wainwright had developed before joining Kaleida, and sold to the company at its inception. Objects in C used preprocessor directives to simulate an object system within the libraries. The library featured more than 240 classes, many of them designed to support multimedia as well as create customized user interfaces. Common data structures such as arrays and linked lists were implemented as collection classes in the library. ScriptX was an object oriented scripting language, which used design elements from \\"Smalltalk, Dylan, Hypertalk, Lisp, Object Logo, C++, and Pascal\\". With Smalltalk, it shared the concept of classes, objects, and inheritance, but also featured multiple inheritance in both classes and objects, and dynamic binding of objects at runtime. ScriptX had no primitive data types; even integers were defined as objects. All objects were instances of a class, and classes themselves were instances of a MetaClass object. As in LISP, there were no statements, and every line in a ScriptX program was an expression that returned a value. ScriptX used garbage collection running in a separate thread to handle memory, and featured an object store for permanent collections. ScriptX supported multi-threading but not multiprocessing, and offered scripting control of lower level operating system features such as events and concurrently running threads. Early multimedia development tools lacked techniques for synchronizing presentations, except by polling the operating system's own clock. Ray Valdés, writing in Dr. Dobb's Journal, noted that, \\"a key ScriptX feature is a Clock class, which provides facilities for synchronizing timed sequences of actions required by multimedia apps.\\"Ray Valdés, \\"Introducing ScriptX\\", Dr. Dobb's Journal, November 1994 Following the closure of Kaleida Labs, Wainwright went on to serve as the principal architect of MaxScript, a scripting language for 3D Studio Max that has been used to process content for gaming and 3D applications such as the Maxis Sims programs.Don Hopkins, \\"Automating The Sims Character Animation Pipeline with MaxScript\\" Thus, ScriptX can be considered a progenitor of MaxScript, which closely resembles ScriptX. ===Example=== The following code illustrates the unique syntax of the ScriptX language. It is part of a class that handles mouse tracking in a larger program written by Don Hopkins.Don Hopkins, \\"TrackService: Yet Another Event Handler for ScriptX\\", Kaleida Labs \\\\-- The sendTrackDrop method sends a trackDrop message to another object. method sendTrackDrop self {class Tracker} service target x y data doit -> ( local coords := new Point repeat while (true) do ( if (canObjectDo target trackDrop) then ( return (trackDrop target service x y data doit) ) else ( coords.x := x coords.y := y local t := findFirstAtPoint target coords if (t == empty) do return false x := x - t.x y := y - t.y target := t ) ) ) This code is responsible for forwarding trackDrop messages between objects, and illustrates a number of uncommon features of the ScriptX language. Of minor note of interest is the \`:=\` assignment operator, like that of Pascal. Variables are marked \`local\` to determine their scope. This is the opposite of most modern languages, where \\"local\\" is the default scope, and such a declaration would be redundant. In conventional languages the scoping visibility is defined by the location in the source code file - variables declared inside a method are local to that method, those defined outside methods or other declarations are global to the class (or program). This lack of file-based scoping is a base feature of the ScriptX language and others like it, notably Dylan. In conventional languages like Java, classes and similar constructs are defined within a single file, or at least a \\"master file\\". Scope is defined by the file system and the code's location within it. In contrast, in ScriptX any method can be defined on any class in any file. In this example, the method \`sendTrackDrop\` is being applied to the \`Tracker\` class, and can be placed within any file that will be accessed during runtime. This allows programmers to organize their code by class or by functionality, at the cost of some extra syntax. ===ScriptX vs. Java=== Java has many similarities with ScriptX. Like ScriptX, it is an object based language with elements of syntax that are similar to C and C++. Java classes support a limited form of multiple inheritance through interfaces, and the Java runtime environment utilizes a garbage collector for memory management with a \\"tracing\\" architecture similar to that of ScriptX. Both Java and ScriptX translate programs into a platform-independent bytecode. Unlike ScriptX, Java is not a pure object system, and has primitive data types. In contrast with ScriptX expressions, Java programs are always written inside a class definition, and return either a value or void. This makes Java code much easier to secure, to protect from tampering and malicious interference. Java was able from the beginning to support multi-processing as well as multi- threaded applications, and thus was naturally scalable. These features, and other attributes of Java, made it more suitable for a distributed and networking environment than ScriptX. Although both ScriptX and Java were designed as platform independent virtual machine environments, their philosophy and implementation were quite different. The Kaleida Media Player was a complex interpreter that required several megabytes to run, and Kaleida never achieved effective performance on a system with less than 16 MB of random-access memory. By contrast, Java was designed to run compiled bytecode on a stripped down virtual machine that could be implemented on virtually any 16-bit or larger processor. In this way, Java could be used anywhere from handheld devices or consumer appliances to mainframe computers. In 1995, Java was being demonstrated mostly as a runtime environment for small applets, as code that could be embedded in web pages and downloaded to run in the browser. Sun Microsystems provided detailed specifications for Java, released many classes in open source, and aggressively formed alliances to distribute it and share its development with other companies throughout the computer hardware and software industries. ==References== ==Further reading== * Kaleida Labs Inc.

Edmund Hobhouse, Bishop of Nelson, and Reginald Hobhouse (1818–95), Archdeacon of Bodmin, were elder brothers. Passing at eleven from a private school to Eton, he remained there seven years (1830–7). In 1837 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, graduated B.A. in 1840 with a first class in classics, and proceeded M.A. in 1844. Entering at Lincoln's Inn on 22 April 1841, he was called to the bar on 6 May 1845, and soon acquired a large chancery and conveyancing practice. ==Early legal career== In 1862 he became a Queen's Counsel and a bencher of his inn, serving the office of treasurer in 1880–1 and practised in the Rolls Court (the civil division of the Court of Appeal). A severe illness in 1866 led him to retire from practice and accept the appointment of charity commissioner. Hobhouse threw himself into the work with energy. He was not only active in administration but advocated a reform of the law governing charitable endowments. The Endowed Schools Act, 1869, was a first step in that direction, and under that act Lord Lyttelton, Hobhouse, and Canon H. G. Robinson were appointed commissioners with large powers of reorganising endowed schools. Much was accomplished in regard to endowed schools, but the efforts of Hobhouse and his fellow commissioners received a check in 1871, when the House of Lords rejected their scheme for remodelling the Emanuel Hospital, Westminster. There followed a controversy which was distasteful to Hobhouse, and with little regret he retired in 1872 in order to succeed Sir James Fitzjames Stephen as law member of the council of the Governor-General of India. Hobhouse had meanwhile served on the royal commission on the operation of the Land Transfer Act in 1869. ==India== Hobhouse, \\"on his departure for India received strong hints that it would be desirable for him to slacken the pace of the legislative machine\\", which had been quickened by the consolidating and codifying activities of Fitzjames Stephen and of Stephen's immediate predecessor, Sir Henry Sumner Maine. That suggestion he approved. Whitley Stokes, secretary in the legislative department, was mainly responsible for the measures passed during Hobhouse's term of office, with the important exception of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, in which Hobhouse as an equity lawyer took an especial interest, and a revision of the law relating to the transfer of property, which became a statute after he left India. Of strong liberal sentiment, Hobhouse had small sympathy with the general policy of the government of India during the opening of Lord Lytton's viceroyalty. The attitude to Afghanistan was especially repugnant. He served from 1875 to 1877 as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. On the conclusion of his term of office in 1877 he was made a K.C.S.I., and returning to England soon engaged in party politics as a thoroughgoing opponent of the Afghan policy of the conservative government. ==Parliamentary candidate== In 1880 he and John Morley unsuccessfully contested Westminster in the liberal interest against Sir Charles Russell, and W. H. Smith. Hobhouse was at the bottom of the poll. ==Judicial Committee of the Privy Council== In 1878 Hobhouse was made arbitrator under the Epping Forest Act and in 1881 he succeeded Sir Joseph Napier on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. There without salary he did useful judicial work for twenty years. He delivered the decision of the committee in 200 appeals, of which 120 were from India. Several cases were of grave moment. In Merriman v. Williams (7 Appeal Cases 484), an action between the bishop and dean of Grahamstown, Hobhouse set forth fully the history of the relationship of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa with the Church of England, and decided that the South African Church is independent of it. In the consolidated appeals in 1887 by several Canadian banks (12 Appeal Cases, 575) against the decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec, which involved the respective limits of the power of the dominion and provincial legislatures to regulate banks, Hobhouse's judgment upheld the right of the province to tax banks and insurance companies constituted by Act of the dominion legislature. In a case from India in 1899 (26 Indian Appeals, Law Reports 113) which necessitated the review of a number of conflicting decisions of the Indian courts, Hobhouse settled a long disputed point in Hindu law and decided, contrary to much tradition, that when an individual person was adopted as an only son, the fact of adoption should be legally recognised and the parents' plenary powers admitted. ==House of Lords== Lord Hobhouse at 83. In 1885 Hobhouse accepted a peerage as Baron Hobhouse, of Hadspen in the County of Somerset, with a view to assisting in the judicial work of the House of Lords, but a statutory qualification by which only judges of the high courts of the United Kingdom could sit to hear appeals had been overlooked. In 1887 the disqualification was removed by Act of Parliament in regard to members of the Judicial Committee; but Hobhouse did not take up the work of a judge in the House of Lords. He only sat there to try three cases, in two of which, Russell v. Countess of Russell (1897 Appeal Cases 395) and the Kempton Park case (1899 Appeal Cases 143), he was in a dissenting minority. As a judge Hobhouse, who was always careful and painstaking, invariably stated the various arguments fully and fairly, but he was tenacious of his deliberately formed opinion. ==London government== While engaged on the Judicial Committee, Hobhouse devoted much energy to local government of London. From 1877 to 1899 he was a vestryman of St George's, Hanover Square. In 1880 he assisted to form and long worked for the London Municipal Reform League, which aimed at securing a single government for the metropolis. From 1882 to 1884 he was a member of the London School Board. Upon the creation of the London County Council in 1888 Hobhouse was one of the first aldermen. ==Personal life== Lord Hobhouse married, on 10 August 1848, the campaigner Mary Ferrer (died 1905), daughter of Thomas Farrer, solicitor, and sister of Thomas Farrer, 1st Baron Farrer, Sir William Farrer (died 1911), and Cecilia Frances (died 1910), wife of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. Advancing years and increasing deafness led him to retire from the Judicial Committee in 1901. He died at his London residence, 15 Bruton Street, Mayfair, on 6 December 1904, and was cremated at Golder's Green. He left no issue, and the peerage became extinct on his death. ==Appreciation and publications== To the last an advanced liberal and constructive legal reformer, Hobhouse, all of whose judicial work was done gratuitously, urged many legal changes, which won adoption very slowly. Much influence is assignable to an address by him before the Social Science Congress at Birmingham in 1868 on the law relating to the property of married women (1869; new edition 1870), and to The Dead Hand (1880), a collection of addresses on endowments and settlements of property (reprinted from the Transactions of the Social Science Association). * ==References== ==Notes== * ==External links== * *Hobhouse, Leonard Trelawny; Hammond, John Lawrence, Lord Hobhouse; a memoir (1905) from the Internet Archive Category:1819 births Category:1904 deaths Category:People from South Somerset (district) Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India Category:Vice Chancellors of the University of Calcutta Category:Members of the London School Board Category:Members of London County Council Arthur Category:Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire ","title":"Arthur Hobhouse, 1st Baron Hobhouse"},{"id":"1423675","text":"Limavady Borough Council ()Limavady Borough Council website was a local government body in Northern Ireland. In May 2015 it merged with Coleraine Borough Council, Ballymoney Borough Council and Moyle District Council under local government reorganisation in Northern Ireland to become Causeway Coast and Glens District Council. Its headquarters were in the town of Limavady, although 63% of the population lived in a rural setting. It covered an area of 586 square kilometres and included the valley of the River Roe. It stretched from the Sperrin Mountains in the south to Benone beach, a seven-mile strand on the Atlantic coast which was the first beach in Northern Ireland to be awarded a Blue Flag. Apart from Limavady other towns in the area included Dungiven and Ballykelly. The Limavady Borough Council area consisted of three electoral areas: Limavady Town, Benbradagh and Bellarena. The Council was established in 1973 and was made up of 15 members who were elected (normally for a four-year term) using a single transferable vote system. Together with the neighbouring district of Coleraine, it formed the East Londonderry constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly. At the last election in 2011 members from the following political parties were elected: 6 Sinn Féin, 3 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), 3 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 2 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and 1 Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV). The posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor were usually rotated annually among the political representatives of the two main traditions within the community as part of the partnership process operated by the Council. In June 2013, the Mayor was Councillor Gerry Mullan (SDLP) and the Deputy Mayor was Councillor James McCorkell (DUP). ==2011 Election results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"6\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\\" !colspan=2 Party  seats  change +/- - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" • Sinn Féin align=\\"right\\" 6 align=\\"right\\" = - ! style=\\"background- color: \\" • Social Democratic and Labour Party align=\\"right\\" 3 align=\\"right\\" = - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" • Democratic Unionist Party align=\\"right\\" 3 align=\\"right\\" = - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" • Ulster Unionist Party align=\\"right\\" 2 align=\\"right\\" = - ! style=\\"background-color: \\" • Traditional Unionist Voice align=\\"right\\" 1 align=\\"right\\" +1* - } * Boyd Douglas, elected as a TUV councillor, had previously held the seat under other designations, most recently (until early 2011) as a United Unionist Coalition representative. ==Review of Public Administration== Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the Council was due to merge with Coleraine Borough Council, Ballymoney Borough Council and Moyle District Council in 2011 to form Causeway Coast and Glens District Council, a single council for the enlarged area totalling 1796 km² and a population of 131,564.

This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context. In systems theory, the process of conflict escalation is modeled by positive feedback. While the word escalation was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the Cold War by two important books: On Escalation (Herman Kahn, 1965) and Escalation and the Nuclear Option (Bernard Brodie, 1966). In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with weapons of mass destruction—the Cold War. Conflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit rules of engagement. Highly successful military tactics exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. Napoleon and Heinz Guderian both advocated this approach. Sun Tzu elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that military strategy was about minimizing escalation, and diplomacy about eliminating it. ==Continuum of force== The United States Marine Corps' \\"Continuum of Force\\" (found in MCRP 3-02B) documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are: ===Level 1: Compliant (cooperative)=== The subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. They refrain from close combat. ===Level 2: Resistant (passive)=== The subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat. ===Level 3: Resistant (active)=== Initially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points. ===Level 4: Assaultive (bodily harm)=== The unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and blows. ===Level 5: Assaultive (lethal force)=== The subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons. ==Preventing== A major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a mindset to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in peacemaking. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of protests, strikes, or other direct actions. Mohandas Gandhi, a major proponent of nonviolence, used satyagraha to demonstrate that: *Peacefully controlling a group of people with a common cause was possible. *One could accomplish objectives through solidarity without capitulating to violent attack. *His method ensured mutual support. *It was possible to desist from retributive justice. *It was not ultimately desirable to inflict punishment, even when grievously wronged. With this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided technological escalation and demonstrated to those in power that: * The group was held together by its own discipline, and not by any kind of authority using violence. * Authority could surrender without being subjected to violence. * Authority could depart safely. * Authority could devolve without obstacles, for the dissent was well enough organized to constitute an effective political party. ==Conflict escalation curve== The conflict escalation curve is a concept created by Michael N. Nagler. The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far dehumanization has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other). The curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed. The curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages. ===Stage 1: Conflict resolution=== In the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. ===Stage 2: Satyagraha=== The conflict escalates into satyagraha, or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called \\"the law of suffering\\"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation. Invoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: \\"The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering.\\"K. Shridharani, \\"War without Violence\\" P. 252. Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders. ===Stage 3: Sacrifice: the last resort=== When the conflict has reached life- or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous \\"fasts unto death\\" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like Kathy Kelly who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors. The philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion. ===How to use the conflict escalation curve=== The conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried. For example, in 2003, US President George W. Bush dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as \\"a focus group,\\" saying: \\"Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group.\\" The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming. ==Systems view== Carol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory. Jay Forrester and Donella Meadows observed that people in crisis would often push the twelve leverage points towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo. ==See also== * Conflict management * Friedrich Glasl's model of conflict escalation * De-escalation * Escalation of commitment ==References== Category:Conflict (process) ","title":"Conflict escalation"},{"id":"1423678","text":"*Leonel Álvarez *Juan Pablo Ángel *Víctor Hugo Aristizábal *Faustino Asprilla *Antony de Ávila *Miguel Calero *James Rodríguez *Juan Cuadrado *Iván Córdoba *Daniel Cruz *Andrés Escobar *Delio \\"Maravilla\\" Gamboa *René Higuita *Carlos Llamosa *Martín Arzuaga *Harold Lozano *Faryd Mondragón *Tressor Moreno *Óscar Pareja *Luis Amaranto Perea *Léider Preciado *Luis Gabriel Rey *Freddy Rincón *Efraín Sánchez *Carlos Valderrama *Adolfo Valencia *Iván René Valenciano *Willington Ortiz *Mario Yepes *Aquivaldo Mosquera * Category:Lists of Colombian sportspeople Colombia Category:Association football player non-biographical articles ","title":"List of Colombia international footballers"},{"id":"1423689","text":"Brand Highway is a main highway linking the northern outskirts of Perth, the capital of Western Australia, to the port city of Geraldton in Western Australia's Mid West region. Together with North West Coastal Highway, it forms part of the Western Australian coastal link to the Northern Territory. The highway is a part of Australia's Highway 1, and is for the most part a single carriageway with one lane in each direction. The highway was completed in 1975 and opened in 1976 by then-Premier Charles Court, who named it in honour of former premier Sir David Brand. It replaced the old alignment from Dongara to Perth (Midlands Road). ==Route description== Looking east along Brand Highway to its southern terminus at the interchange with Great Northern and Tonkin Highways. Brand Highway, along with the associated section of National Route 1, begins in Muchea, branching off from a roundabout interchange connecting it to both Great Northern Highway to the north and east and Tonkin Highway to the south. The highway passes through agricultural areas and shrublands, travelling through or near the towns of Gingin, Badgingarra (and Badgingarra National Park), Cataby, Eneabba, Dongara, and Greenough. The highway ends after at the city of Geraldton. National Route 1, and traffic travelling to areas further north of here, continue along North West Coastal Highway towards Port Hedland. The vast majority of the highway is a two-lane single carriageway with a speed limit of , except in and around built up areas where it slows down to speeds of between . Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state's road network, including various locations along Brand Highway. In the 2012/13 financial year, the recorded traffic volumes ranged from 15,400 vehicles per day north of Olive Street, near Geraldton, down to 1470 south of Indian Ocean Drive. The highest percentage of heavy vehicles was 36.0% south of Airfield Road, the access road to RAAF Gingin. Reports commissioned by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) in 2006 and 2008 gave the highway a three-star safety rating out of five. The overall highway network was generally rated as three-star or four-star, with around 10% in 2006 and 5% in 2008 receiving a two-star rating. === Wheatbelt === From Great Northern and Tonkin Highways at Muchea, Brand Highway heads west for to the town centre, crossing over the Midland railway line. It heads north-west, paralleling the railway for , towards Gingin. While the railway continues north to the town, the highway deviates to the west, continuing north-west through the Wheatbelt. Brand Highway reaches the Regans Ford roadhouse after . on, the highway turns north for , past Bandgingarra National Park, to Badgingarra. Brand Highway leaves the Wheatbelt for the Mid West region, continuing its journey north-westwards. === Mid West === Brand Highway encounters Eneabba beyond Badgingarra, and after another meets the northern end of the coastal road Indian Ocean Drive. The highway travels north for to the terminus of The Midlands Road, just outside Dongara. Brand Highway heads west for into the town, and then follows the coast north and north- westwards. It reaches South Greenough after , where it realigns itself to the north-east via two 90° curves. Brand Highway continues north-west, passing through Greenough after , and terminating further on in Geraldton, at a diamond interchange with North West Coastal Highway. For the last of its length, Brand Highway serves as the main road for the southern suburbs of Geraldton, including Wandina, Tarcoola Beach, Mount Tarcoola and Mahomets Flats. ==History== Within two years of its formation in 1926, Western Australia's new Main Roads Board became responsible for the state's arterial and trunk roads, which were declared 'main roads' under the Main Roads Act. The main road to Geraldton branched off the Perth–Meekatharra road at Walebing, near Moora, travelled an inland route via Mingenew to Dongara, and then continued north along the coast to Geraldton. A new main road from Perth to Geraldton via Mogumber was proposed in the 1940s, but was rejected by the Minister for Works, who considered the development of parallel routes infeasible given that traffic was light. Western Australia's Nomenclature Advisory Committee proposed in October 1940 that a highway name, Great Northern Highway, be used to describe the main route from Midland to Geraldton, and extending to areas further north. By July 1941, the committee's proposal had expanded to three highway names for the roads in the state's northern areas: Great Northern Highway for the Midland Junction to Wyndham road, North West Coastal Highway for the road linking Geraldton to Port Hedland and De Grey, and Geraldton Highway for the Walebing–Mingenew–Geraldton route. This road was gazetted as Geraldton Highway on 17 September 1943, superseding the previously used names of Choral Street, Yarma Street, Railway road, Midland Street, Railway Street, and Irwin Road. From the 1950s, increasing development between Perth and Geraldton saw the planning and establishment of a road network linking Dongara and Gingin – though the roads were not initially intended to become a highway. Early surveying of the roads, in the 1950s, was undertaken from within a light aircraft flying over the area. This was one of the first times in Western Australia that this technique was used. Wide road reserves, up to in width, were acquired from crown land and pastoral leases. This allowed native wildflowers to survive and flourish on public land, providing aesthetically pleasing and interesting views to reduce road hypnosis and driver fatigue. The road would also be made safer by removing natural roadside obstacles, and replacing them with shrubs and more wildflowers. Construction of new roads that would eventually be part of the Brand Highway began in 1959. Various segments were completed as the need arose, until in 1975, there was a new link between Perth and Geraldton. The route reduced the distance between the cities by , and had a total cost of $4.2 million. On 14 February 1975, the new road was gazetted as part of the Geraldton Highway, with the old route via Moora renamed The Midlands Road. It was officially opened on 4 April 1975 by the Minister for Transport, Ray O'Connor at Eneabba. One year later, the road was named Brand Highway after Sir David Brand, who was Premier of Western Australia from 1959 to 1971 and also held the local electorate of Greenough from 1945 to 1975.Brand Highway (October 1976). Western Roads: official journal of the Main Roads Department, Western Australia, 1(4), p.9. Perth: Main Roads Department. The change of name from Geraldton Highway to Brand Highway was gazetted on 12 March 1976. Then- premier Charles Court officiated a ceremony held on 30 April 1976 at a tourist information bay in Dongara, where a plaque was unveiled commemorating the naming of the highway. The northern end of Brand Highway was upgraded as part of Stage 1 of the Geraldton Southern Transport Corridor, the biggest individual project in the early 2000s across all of rural Western Australia. The project, constructed between March 2004 and December 2005 at a cost of $92.5 million, involved the relocation of railway tracks, worth of road works, and grade separation of roads. Brand Highway's northern terminus at North West Coastal Highway was upgraded from a roundabout to an interchange. An overpass was built for nearby Durlacher Street to cross North West Coastal Highway, which was made into a dual carriageway in the vicinity of the interchange. Stage 2 of the project, constructed between December 2008 and December 2009, provided a new single carriageway connection to Geraldton–Mount Magnet Road, with access to Geraldton Airport.

The Midlands Road, also known as Midlands Road, is a road in the Mid West and Wheatbelt regions of Western Australia. From Great Northern Highway at Walebing, the road travels west to Moora and then north to Watheroo. The road continues north to Gunyidi, and then travels north-west to Mingenew via Coorow, Carnamah, and Three Springs. Beyond Mingenew, it heads west to Dongara, terminating at Brand Highway. The section from Moora northwards is part of State Route 116, which continues south to Bindoon via Bindoon Moora Road. The section from Walebing to Watheroo National Park is part of Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 360). ==See also== * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Western Australia ==Notes== ==References* Main Roads Western Australia Category:Highways in rural Western Australia Category:Mid West (Western Australia) Category:Highway 1 (Australia) ","title":"Brand Highway"},{"id":"1423698","text":"right Marie Louise Berneri (March 1, 1918 – April 13, 1949) was an anarchist activist and author. Born in Italy, she spent much of her life in Spain, France, and England. She was involved with the short-lived publication, Revision, with Luis Mercier Vega and was a member of the group that edited Revolt, War Commentary, and the Freedom newspaper, which is still being published by the Freedom Bookstore in London. She was a continuous contributor to Spain and the World. She also wrote a survey of utopias, Journey Through Utopia, first published in 1950 and re-issued in 2020. Neither East Nor West is a selection of her writings (1952). ==Early life== She was born in Arezzo, Italy, the elder daughter of Camillo & Giovanna Berneri. The family went into exile in 1926 for resisting Mussolini. In 1936 her father went to Spain, to fight against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War. He was assassinated by communists in 1937. Marie visited Barcelona twice, the second time after her father's murder. Around this time she was living in France and studying psychology at the Sorbonne. ==Anarchism== Towards the end of 1937 she married Vernon Richards, also an active anarchist with many of the same groups and publications as she. In April 1945 she was one of the four editors of War Commentary which she had helped to found, who were tried for incitement to disaffection. Because her husband was a co-defendant, she was acquitted on a legal technicality that allows that a wife cannot conspire with her husband. When her three comrades were imprisoned, she took on the main responsibility for maintaining the paper into the postwar period. She attended the first post-war international anarchist conference in Paris, 1948 as a member of the British delegation. Her mother and sister Giliane Berneri, a medical doctor, also attended as members of the Italian and French delegations. She received much praise for her Freedom Press pamphlet, the anti-Stalinist Workers in Stalin's Russia (1944).Orwell:Collected Works, Smohtered Under Journalism p.368, Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow, David Goodway.

The party's request to register the name and abbreviation was submitted in early September 2004, verified late October-early November and reserved on Friday, December 17, 2004. The name was judged to be not acceptable by Elections Ontario on March 10, 2005. The Representative Party of Ontario hoped to become the grassroot Reform-oriented alternative to the main Liberal, Progressive Conservative and New Democratic parties in the province. The party's traditional populist beliefs in representative and direct democracy follow those of the politics of pre- Confederation Reform Party leader William Lyon Mackenzie, former United Farmers of Ontario premier Ernest Charles Drury and former Ontario Cooperative Commonwealth Federation member Agnes Campbell Macphail. It planned to adopt a statement of principles, policies and platform built on a \\"people-first- politics\\" constitution. The constitution was to be ratified in a democratically held assembly by on a one-member one-vote basis. The party's interim leader, Bill Cook, ran in the Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey by- election of 2005 as the \\"Independent Representative\\" candidate. He placed sixth out of eight candidates.

The army group remained isolated in the Courland Pocket until the end of World War II in Europe. All units of the Army Group were ordered to surrender by the capitulated Wehrmacht command on 8 May 1945. At the time agreed for all German armed forces to end hostilities (see the German Instrument of Surrender, 1945), the Sixteenth and Eighteenth armies of Army Group Courland, commanded by General (of Infantry) Carl Hilpert, ended hostilities at 23:00, on 8 May 1945, surrendering to Leonid Govorov, commander of the Leningrad Front. By the evening of 9 May 1945 189,000 German troops, including 42 officers in the rank of general, in the Courland Pocket had surrendered.May 9th 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau) part of the RIA Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project ==History== ===Naming=== Stamp used in Courland pocket (1945) The aggregation of troops that became named Army Group Courland was created when the Red Army reached the Baltic Sea near the Memel river on Tuesday, 10 October 1944. As a result, what was then known as Army Group North was cut off in one section of Latvia from the rest of the German Army, and was to stay cut off for the remainder of the war. Approximately 200,000 German troops in 26 divisions were in what was to become known as the Courland Pocket, pushed against the Baltic Sea in the West, the Irbe Strait in the North and the Gulf of Riga in the East. It covers northwestern Latvia. Army Group Courland remained in existence until the end of the war in Europe. Army Group Courland was created on 25 January 1945, when German dictator Adolf Hitler renamed Army Group North, Army Group Center, and Army Group A. Hitler's name changes meant that Army Group North became Army Group Courland (Heeresgruppe Kurland), Army Group Center became Army Group North (Heeresgruppe Nord) and Army Group A became Army Group Center (Heeresgruppe Mitte). ===Isolation=== Army Group Courland consisted of the German Sixteenth Army and the German Eighteenth Army. The two armies had been sent to Courland partly to protect training grounds for the remaining Nazi U-boat forces.World War II - Willmott, H.P. et al., Dorling Kindersley Publishers Ltd, 2004 Bypassed by the main Soviet thrusts, Army Group Courland remained relatively intact. Even towards the end of the war, the army was able to field between twenty-four to thirty-one divisions, with the exact number of divisions depending on how many of the associated or understrength divisions are counted. Even so, with its back to the Baltic Sea, it also remained largely cut off from re-supply, and was unable to break out or evacuate. Army Group Courland fought six major battles in the Courland Pocket between 15 October 1944, and 4 April 1945. The dates for the six battles were as follows: # From 15 October 1944, to 22 October 1944 # From 27 October 1944 to 25 November 1944 # From 23 December 1944 to 31 December 1944 # From 23 January 1945 to 3 February 1945 # From 12 February 1945 to 19 February 1945 # From 17 March 1945 to 4 April 1945 Soviet ultimatum On 7 May 1945, German Head of State (Staatsoberhaupt) and President (Reichspräsident) Karl Dönitz ordered Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, to surrender Army Group Courland. Hilpert was the army group's last commander-in-chief.May 12th, 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau Our Victory) part of the RIA Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project notes that Hilpert was commander of the XXXVIII Corps, it explains why only 3 divisions surrenderd with him Hilpert surrendered himself, his personal staff, and three divisions of the XXXVIII Corps to Marshal of the Soviet Union Leonid Govorov. Hilpert sent the following message to his troops: \\"To all ranks! Marshal Govorod (sic) has agreed to a cease-fire beginning at 14:00 hours on 8 May. Troops to be informed immediately. White flags to be displayed. Commander expects loyal implemenation of order, on which the fate of all Courland troops depends.\\"Hans Dollinger 'The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan -, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047, Page 290 On 8 May, a General Otto Friedrich Rauser (Chief of Logistics of the Army Group) succeeded in obtaining better surrender terms from the Soviets. On 9 May, the Soviet commission in Peilei started to interrogate the captive staff of Army Group Courland. The Soviets began a general round-up of all remaining German troops in the Courland Pocket.The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan - Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047, Page 278 By end of the 11 May the troops of the Leningrad Front had secured the Courland peninsula, reaching the coast of the Riga Bay and the Baltic Sea.May 11th, 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau Our Victory) part of the RIA Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project From 9 May to 12 May 140,408 men and non-commissioned officers, 5,083 officers and 28 generals in the Courland Pocket, surrendered. The equipment captured in the same period consisted of 75 aircraft; 307 tanks and self-propelled guns; 1,427 guns; 557 mortars; 3,879 machineguns; 52,887 rifles and submachine-guns; 219 armored personnel carriers; 310 radio stations; 4,281 motor vehicles; 240 tractors, 3,442 carts loaded with military cargoes, 14,056 horses.May 12th, 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau Our Victory) part of the RIA Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project On 23 May, the Soviet round-up of the German troops in the Courland Pocket was completed. A total of about 180,000 German troops were taken into captivity. Captive German officers were turned over to the NKVD. The bulk of the captives were taken to camps in Valdai Hills. ===Aftermath=== After the surrender, some elements of Army Group Courland briefly attempted to reform itself as a Freikorps. This was an act reminiscent of similar actions taken at the end of World War I, but atypical for the end of World War II. The formation of a Freikorps was prevented by the Soviets, who were obviously unwilling to allow such an action by a beaten foe. In addition, the Soviets did not intend for Germans to remain settled in the Courland area after the war. A number of German, Estonian and, Latvian soldiers evaded Soviet capture. Approximately 4000 Latvian soldiers went to the forests and formed partisan organizations to continue their fight against the Soviets and to gain independence for the Soviet-occupied Latvia. ==Commanders== ==Senior officers at capitulation== * General of Infantry Carl Hilpert, Commander of Army Group Courland; * Lieutenant-General Friedrich Foertsch, Chief of Staff of the German Army Group Courland; * Major-General Otto Friedrich Rauser, Chief of Logistics of the Army Group Courland; * Lieutenant-General Keler, chief of the veterinary service of the Army Group Courland; * Lieutenant-General Volckamer von Kirchensittenbach, Commander of the Sixteenth Army; * Lieutenant-General Ehrenfried-Oskar Boege, Commander of the Eighteenth Army; * Lieutenant-General Usinger, Commander of the I Army Corps; * Lieutenant-General Gause, Commander of the II Army Corps; * General of Artillery Thomaschki, Commander of the X Army Corps; * Lieutenant-General Weber, Commander of the XVI Army Corps; * General of Artillery Herzog, Commander of the XXXVIII Army Corps; * Lieutenant-General Feyerabend, Commander of the 11th Infantry Division; * Major-General Schultz, Commander of the 24th Infantry Division; * Major- General Henze, Commander of the 30th Infantry Division; * Lieutenant-General Franz Eccard von Bentivegni, Commander of the 81st Infantry Division; * Lieutenant-General Strachwitz, Commander of the 87th Infantry Division; * Major-General Ottomar Hansen, Commander of the 121st Infantry Division; * Major-General Schatz, Commander of the 122nd Infantry Division; * Major- General Haehling, Commander of the 126th Infantry Division; * Major-General Demme, Commander of the 132nd Infantry Division; * Major-General Giese, Commander of the 205th Infantry Division; * Lieutenant-General Ranck, Commander of the 218th Infantry Division; * Major-General Bauer; * Major- General Risse, Commander of the 225th Infantry Division; * Major-General Hemmann, Commander of the 263rd Infantry Division; * Major-General Eberth, Commander of the 300th Special Infantry Division; * Lieutenant-General Menkel, Commander of the 329th Infantry Division; * Lieutenant-General Neuman, Commander of the 563rd Volksgrenadier Division; * Major-General Otto Barth, Commander of a combat group of the 21st Luftwaffe Field Division; * Lieutenant-General Band, Commander of the Courland Fortified Area; * SS- Gruppenführer Streckenbach, Commander of the 19th Latvian Division; * Major- General Horst von Usedom, Commander of the 12th Panzer Division; * Colonel Karl-Max Gräßel, Commander of the 14th Panzer Division; * Major-General Muller, commandant of the city of Libava. * SS Obergruppenfuhrer von Pfeffer- Wildenbrauch of the 6th Army Corps May 10th, 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau Our Victory) part of the RIA Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project == See also == * List of World War II military units of Germany ==References== * May 09th 1945 (From the Soviet Information Bureau) part of the Russian News and Information Agency Novosti 60 anniversary of surrender project * Dollinger, Hans.

The story, set in the medieval period, tries to explain three huge linden trees whose branches intertwine to cover the entire cemetery of the Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Berlin. According to the story, three brothers care very deeply for each other. One day, the youngest brother comes across a blacksmith's apprentice who has just been stabbed to death. While he decides whether to tell the authorities or to flee the scene of the crime, the city constables find him and arrest him for the murder. At his trial, facts come out that link him to the victim, and it appears that he will be hanged, despite all his protests that he is innocent. Just then, the middle brother, who has been waiting for his younger brother to return home, hears what has happened. Not wanting to see his brother executed, he appears in court and accuses himself of the murder. He is locked up while the judge tries to determine who the real murderer is. Shortly after, the eldest brother returns home from his travels and, learning what happened to his two younger brother, accuses himself of the crime. He too is arrested. When the youngest brother unwittingly discovers what his two brothers have done on his behalf, he tearfully admits to the judge that he is the murderer. Not knowing whom to blame, the judge turns to the local prince. He does not believe that any of the brothers is guilty, but realizes that it is too important a decision to leave to chance. To resolve the problem, he announces that he will leave it up to God and comes up with an ordeal. Each of the brothers will plant a linden tree with its crown in the ground and its roots in the sky. Whoever's tree withered first would be considered the murderer. The unexpected happened and all three trees began to grow and flourish. All three brothers were innocent, so all three trees thrive. These are the trees overhanging the cemetery outside the Hospital of the Holy Spirit. The story was written in German and originally published in Die Alpen in 1912.

There is now nothing visible of the villa above ground and the site is occupied by a later churchyard. The villa's most famous feature is the Orpheus mosaic, the second largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most intricate. It dates to c.

In 1977 two Muslim Majlis members were elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly on the Janata Party symbol. Following the death of Faridi the influence of the party declined. After the death of Faridi, Alhaj Zulfiqarulla became the president and after that Mohd. Qamar Alam Kazmi became the president of All India Muslim Majlis. In 1992 Qamar Alam Kazmi raised his voice against the demolition of Babri Masjid. He started Karwane Insaf (Nyay Yatra) against the Ram Rath Yatra of Advani. He did several of Dharnas, Morchas etc. in between the period of his presidency. In 2002 Muslim Majlis joined the Awami Front, but later left it under the presidency of Qamar Alam Kazmi. After Kazmi, Khalid Sabir was elected as president on 18 August 2002. The youth wing of the party is called All India Youth Majlis. The president of the youth wing is Mohammad Kashif Yunus. Muslim Majlis later joined Uttar Pradesh United Democratic Front led by ex-minister Janab C.M. Ibrahim and patronised by Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari.

He is noted for his book The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea (1997), a creative nonfiction work which became a bestseller; and for his documentary films Restrepo (2010) and Korengal (2014), which won awards. He also wrote the book War (2010). ==Background== Junger was born in Belmont, Massachusetts, the son of Ellen Sinclair, a painter, and Miguel Chapero Junger, a physicist. Born in Dresden, Germany and of Russian, Austrian, Spanish, and Italian descent, his father immigrated to the United States during World War II to escape persecution because of paternal Jewish ancestry and to study engineering at MIT. Junger grew up in the Belmont neighborhood, which he learned was the territory of the Boston Strangler. He was later inspired to write A Death in Belmont (2006). Junger graduated from Concord Academy in 1980 and received a bachelor of arts degree from Wesleyan University in cultural anthropology in 1984. ==Career== Junger began working as a freelance writer, often trying to publish articles on topics that interested him. He often took other jobs for temporary periods of time to support himself. Researching dangerous occupations as a topic, he became deeply engaged in learning about commercial fishing and its hazards. In 1997, with the success of his non-fiction book, The Perfect Storm, Junger was touted as a new Hemingway. His work stimulated renewed interest in adventure non- fiction. The book received a large pre-publication deal for movie rights, was on the New York Times bestseller list for a year in the hardback edition, and for two years in paperback. In 2000 Junger published an article \\"The Forensics of War,\\" in Vanity Fair. He received a National Magazine Award for this. He continues to work there as a contributing editor. In early 2007 he reported from Nigeria on the subject of blood oil. With the British photographer Tim Hetherington, Junger created The Other War: Afghanistan, produced with ABC News and Vanity Fair. It was shown on Nightline in September 2008 and the two men shared the DuPont-Columbia Award for broadcast journalism for the work. His book War (2010) revolves around a platoon of the US Army 173rd Airborne stationed in Afghanistan. Junger, along with Hetherington, used material gathered in the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan for the book and to create a related documentary feature Restrepo. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and won the Grand Jury Prize for a domestic documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010. On April 27, 2011, Junger was presented with the \\"Leadership in Entertainment Award\\" by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) for his work on Restrepo.\\"IAVA to Honor Restrepo Directors Sebastian Junger, Tim Hetherington at Heroes Celebration\\". Junger's most recent book, Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging, was published in May 2016. ==Personal life== His first daughter was born in 2016 when he was age 55. He lives in New York City and Massachusetts. He co-owned a bar in New York called The Half-King. He is an atheist. ==Notable work== ===The Perfect Storm=== Junger's book The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea (1997) became an international bestseller. It recounts a storm in October 1991 that resulted in the Gloucester fishing boat Andrea Gail going down off the coast of Nova Scotia, and the loss of all six crew members: Billy Tyne, Bobby Shatford, Alfred Pierre, David Sullivan, Michael Moran and Dale Murphy. In 2000, the book was adapted by Warner Brothers as a film of the same name, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. Junger said that while recovering from a chainsaw injury, he was inspired to write about dangerous jobs. He planned to start with commercial fishing in Gloucester, Massachusetts. He developed this project as The Perfect Storm, as he became more involved with learning about the crew members and the conditions and decisions that contributed to their deaths. Junger established The Perfect Storm Foundation to provide cultural and educational grants to children across the country whose parents make their living in the commercial fishing industry. ===A Death in Belmont=== A Death in Belmont centers on the 1963 rape and murder of Bessie Goldberg. This was during the period from 1962 to 1964 of the infamous Boston Strangler crimes. Junger received the 2007 PEN/Winship award for the book. Junger raises the possibility in his book that the real Strangler was Albert DeSalvo. He eventually confessed to committing several Strangler murders, but not Goldberg's. Roy Smith, an African-American man, was convicted in her death based on circumstantial evidence. Junger suggests that Smith's conviction for Goldberg's death was influenced by racism. The prosecution called witnesses who remembered seeing Smith chiefly because he was a black man walking in a predominately white neighborhood. (Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be notoriously flawed.) Smith had cleaned Goldberg's house the day she was attacked and left a receipt (for his work) with his name on her kitchen counter. No physical evidence, such as bruises or blood, linked Smith to the crime. In 1976, he was granted commutation of his life sentence. Before he gained release, Smith died of lung cancer. Junger draws no conclusions about the guilt or innocence of either Smith or DeSalvo. Goldberg's daughter has vigorously disputed Junger's suggestion that Smith may have been innocent. Defense attorney Alan Dershowitz said in his review of the book: It \\"must be read with the appropriate caution that should surround any work of nonfiction in which the author is seeking a literary or dramatic payoff.\\" He noted that Junger did not include endnotes or footnotes, and suggested he may have had too much interest in \\"playing down coincidences and emphasizing connections.\\"Alan Dershowitz, \\"The Belmont Strangler\\", New York Times, 16 April 2006; accessed 31 October 2018 ===Fire=== Fire is a collection of articles about dangerous regions or dangerous occupations. In the chapter \\"Lion in Winter\\", Junger interviews Ahmad Shah Massoud, leader of the Afghan Northern Alliance and known as the Lion of the Panjshir. He was a famed resistance fighter against the Soviets and the Taliban. Junger was one of the last Western journalists to interview Massoud in depth. Much of this was first published in March 2001 for National Geographic Adventure, along with photographs by Iranian photographer Reza Deghati and video by cinematographer Stephen Cocklin.Afghanistan Revealed  Watch the Documentary Film Free Online  SnagFilms.Afghanistan Revealed  National Geographic Education Video \\"Afghanistan Revealed Review\\". Entertainment Weekly. Massoud was assassinated on September 9, 2001. Junger's portrait of Massoud suggests a different future for the country if he had been able to continue his work. Fire also details the conflict diamond trade in Sierra Leone, genocide in Kosovo, and the hazards of fire-fighting in the state of Idaho in the United States. ===Restrepo=== Junger with Tim Hetherington in 2011 In 2009, Junger made his first film, the documentary feature Restrepo, as director with photographer Tim Hetherington. The two worked together in Afghanistan on assignment for Vanity Fair. Junger and Hetherington spent a year with one platoon in the Korengal Valley, which is billed as the deadliest valley in Afghanistan. They recorded video to document their experience, and this footage went on to form the basis for Restrepo. The title refers to the outpost where Junger was embedded, which was named after a combat medic, Pfc. Juan Restrepo, killed in action. As Junger explained, \\"It's a completely apolitical film. We wanted to give viewers the experience of being in combat with soldiers, and so our cameras never leave their side. There are no interviews with generals; there is no moral or political analysis. It is a purely experiential film.\\" Restrepo, which premiered on the opening night of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, won the grand jury prize for a domestic documentary. The actor David Hyde Pierce presented the award in Park City, Utah. Junger self-financed the film. Restrepo was nominated for the 2011 Academy Award for Best Documentary. ===War=== Medal of honor recipient Sgt. Salvatore Giunta beside President Barack ObamaThe visits from June 2007 to June 2008 to eastern Afghanistan to the Korengal Valley with Tim Hetherington resulted not only in their reports and pictures published in Vanity Fair in 2008 and the film Restrepo (2010), but also in Junger's best-selling book War (2010), which rewrites and expands upon his Vanity Fair dispatches. Junger in War, tells the story of Staff Sergent Sal Giunta. His actions during the fighting in the Korengal Valley made him the first soldier to still be alive when receiving the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. Time magazine named War a \\"Top Ten Non-fiction Book\\" of 2010. ===Which Way is the Front Line From Here?=== Junger speaking at the LBJ Library, which screened Which Way is the Front Line From Here? In April 2013, Junger's film Which Way is the Front Line From Here? The Life and Time of Tim Hetherington, debuted at the LBJ Presidential Library. Produced in conjunction with HBO Documentary Films, it documents the life of Tim Hetherington, focusing upon his documenting the humanity of people caught up in war. ===Korengal=== The 2014 film Korengal continues to follow the soldiers in Battle Company 2/503 during and after their service in the Korengal Valley. The film takes a deeper look into the psychology of the men, who are deployed in the rugged mountains of the Korengal Valley. Junger sought to find out what combat did to, and for them, and seek a deeper understanding of why war is meaningful to them. The film opened in June 2013 in theaters. It also played at the Pritzker Military Library and Museum, The Pentagon, Army Heritage and Education Foundation Center, Capitol Hill, United States Military Academy, The National Infantry Museum, Little Rock Film Festival, Key West Film Festival, and the DocuWest Film Festival. ===The Last Patrol=== The last of the trilogy about war and its effects on soldiers, this documentary explores \\"what it means for combat soldiers to reintegrate into daily American life.\\" Junger recruited former US Army Sgt. Brendan O'Byrne, who appeared in the film Restrepo, US Army soldier Dave Roels, and Spanish photo-journalist Guillermo Cervera to walk the rail corridor between Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. The journey was planned as a tribute to deceased photographer Tim Hetherington. The film premiered at the Margaret Mead Film Festival and aired on HBO in November. The film played in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, as well as at the Savannah Film Festival, and at Seattle International Film Festival. ===Tribe=== In Tribe (2016) Junger studies war veterans from an anthropological perspective and asks \\"How do you make veterans feel that they are returning to a cohesive society that was worth fighting for in the first place?\\" Junger's premise is that \\"Soldiers ignore differences of race, religion and politics within their platoon...\\" and upon return to America, find a fractious society splintered into various competing factions, often hostile to one another. ==See also== * List of American print journalists ==References* * Outside magazine, articles. * Vanity Fair, articles. * * The Daily Show interview, May 11, 2010, on his book War * KGNU interview with Claudia Cragg on his book War * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American historians Category:21st-century American historians Category:20th-century atheists Category:21st-century atheists Category:American atheists Category:American cinematographers Category:American documentary film directors Category:American film directors of Italian descent Category:American investigative journalists Category:American magazine journalists Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American male screenwriters Category:American military historians Category:American non- fiction crime writers Category:American people of Austrian descent Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:American television writers Category:American war correspondents Category:American writers of Italian descent Category:American writers of Russian descent Category:Journalists from New York City Category:Concord Academy alumni Category:Film directors from Massachusetts Category:Film directors from New York City Category:Film producers from Massachusetts Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:Historians from Massachusetts Category:Historians from New York (state) Category:American male television writers Category:People from Belmont, Massachusetts Category:People from Concord, Massachusetts Category:Screenwriters from Massachusetts Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) Category:War correspondents of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:Writers from New York City ","title":"Sebastian Junger"},{"id":"1423762","text":"Insaf Party (Justice Party), was a Muslim political party founded by Syed ShahabuddinWebsite of Syed Shahabuddin , Retrieved on 14 June 2013 in 1989.

He previously played for the Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlanta Hawks. He is the son of long-time NBA player and former NBA head coach Mike Dunleavy Sr. ==High school career== As a 1999 graduate of Jesuit High School in Beaverton, Oregon, Dunleavy led them to the 1999 4A State Boys Basketball Championship over North Salem High School, 65–38. Dunleavy attended the University School of Milwaukee for his freshman year, and Homestead High School in Mequon, Wisconsin for his sophomore year. ==College career== Dunleavy played at Duke University from 1999–2002. As a sophomore, he played on Duke's national championship team and scored a team-high 21 points in the title game, including 3 three-pointers during a decisive 11–2 second-half Duke run. As a junior, Dunleavy was a first-team NABC All-American, averaging 17.3 points per game and 7.2 rebounds per game for the 31–4 Blue Devils. In 2001–02, Dunleavy, Jay Williams, and Carlos Boozer each scored at least 600 points for the season, a feat only matched at Duke by Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler, and Nolan Smith in the 2009–10 season. ==Professional career== Dunleavy with the Pacers ===Golden State Warriors (2002–2007)=== Dunleavy was selected by the Golden State Warriors third overall in the 2002 NBA draft. In November 2005, the Warriors signed Dunleavy to a 5-year, $44 million contract extension. The Warriors' general manager Chris Mullin said, \\"The way Mike performed, the way he conducted himself and the way we run our organization, we both felt it was something that we wanted.\\" The deal drew criticism from fans, though, in light of the other large contracts that the Warriors franchise had signed, including those of Adonal Foyle and Derek Fisher. During the 2005-06 season, Dunleavy lost his starting role as small forward for a number of games, due partly to a shooting slump. He won back the starting job later in the season and was expected to start at his new position of power forward for the 2006–07 season. Some early struggles, however, prompted Warriors head coach Don Nelson to send Dunleavy back to the bench, juggling his lineup in search of better team chemistry and winning results. ===Indiana Pacers (2007–2011)=== On January 17, 2007, Dunleavy was dealt to the Indiana Pacers along with teammates Troy Murphy, Ike Diogu, and Keith McLeod for Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, and Josh Powell. In his first full season with the Pacers, Dunleavy started all 82 games and averaged a career-high 19.1 points per game. Dunleavy in 2009 with Indiana During the 2010-2011 season, the Indiana Pacers advanced to the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2006 thanks to an end of the season win over the Washington Wizards coupled with a Charlotte Bobcats loss to the Orlando Magic. Dunleavy scored 14 points in the 136–112 victory. Dunleavy also ended his career playoff drought of 9 years and 624 games. He was the second active leader in this category behind former Warriors and Pacers teammate Troy Murphy, who also ended his drought as a part of the Boston Celtics. Chris Wilcox of the Boston Celtics now holds the record. ===Milwaukee Bucks (2011–2013)=== Following the 2011 NBA lockout, Dunleavy signed a two-year, $7.5 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks on December 10. His best game as a Buck came on November 3, 2012 when he recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds against the Cleveland Cavaliers. ===Chicago Bulls (2013–2016)=== On July 10, 2013, Dunleavy signed with the Chicago Bulls, on a reported two-year deal worth about $6 million. On April 25, 2014, Dunleavy set a playoff career-high 35 points including a franchise playoff record for most three-point field goals with 8 against the Washington Wizards in game three of their 2014 NBA Playoffs first round match-up, which the Bulls won 100–97. Dunleavy injured his right ankle against the Denver Nuggets on January 1, 2015 and was sidelined for over a month. On July 14, 2015, Dunleavy re-signed with the Bulls to a reported three-year, $14.4 million contract. After missing the Bulls' first 16 games of the season due to a back injury, he was ruled out for a further four-to-six weeks on December 3 due to the injury requiring additional rehabilitation. On February 1, 2016, using the flexible assignment rule, Dunleavy was assigned to the Santa Cruz Warriors, the D-League affiliate of the Golden State Warriors, with the goal to practice there during the Bulls' West Coast road trip. Two days later, he was recalled by the Bulls. On February 6, Dunleavy made his season debut for the Bulls after missing the first 49 games. He played 14 minutes and scored five points in a 112–105 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. ===Cleveland Cavaliers (2016–2017)=== On July 7, 2016, Dunleavy was traded, along with the rights to Vladimir Veremeenko, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for the rights to Albert Miralles. He made his debut for the Cavaliers in the team's season opener on October 25, 2016 against the New York Knicks. In 22 minutes off the bench, he recorded four points, four rebounds, two assists and three steals in a 117–88 win. On December 23, 2016, he scored a season-high 14 points in a 119–99 win over the Brooklyn Nets. ===Atlanta Hawks (2017)=== On January 7, 2017, Dunleavy was traded, along with Mo Williams and a future first-round draft pick, to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Kyle Korver. After initially refusing to report to the Hawks while seeking a buyout of his contract, Dunleavy changed his mind and agreed to join the Hawks. On January 10, he reported to the team and passed his physical. Three days later, he made his debut for the Hawks, scoring six points on a pair of three-pointers in a 103–101 loss to the Boston Celtics. On January 15, he scored 20 points off the bench in a 111–98 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. It was his first 20-point performance since a first-round playoff game for Chicago on April 30, 2015. On March 3, 2017, Dunleavy was diagnosed with right ankle synovitis. He returned to action on March 22 against Washington after a 13-game injury layoff. On June 30, 2017, he was waived by the Hawks, and retired shortly afterwards. ==Post-player career== On September 24, 2018, Dunleavy was hired by the Golden State Warriors as a pro scout. On August 29, 2019, Dunleavy was promoted to assistant general manager of the Warriors. ==Personal life== Dunleavy has two younger brothers: Baker, who played at Villanova from 2002–06 and is the current head coach at Quinnipiac;Villanova’s Baker Dunleavy will be Quinnipiac’s head basketball coach and James, who was a walk-on for USC and is currently an NBA player agent. His father is Mike Dunleavy Sr., former Los Angeles Clippers coach, retired NBA player, and the former head coach at Tulane. While growing up, Dunleavy attended a residential sports camp in Eagle River, Wisconsin called Camp Menominee. In 2008, Camp Menominee honored Dunleavy by naming its basketball courts \\"The Mike Dunleavy Jr. Courts\\". ==NBA career statistics== ===Regular season=== -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  82  3  15.9  .403  .347  .780  2.6  1.3  .6  .2  5.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  75  69  31.1  .449  .370  .741  5.9  2.9  .9  .2  11.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  79  79  32.5  .451  .388  .779  5.5  2.6  1.0  .3  13.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  81  68  31.8  .406  .285  .778  4.9  2.9  .7  .4  11.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Golden State  39  6  26.9  .449  .346  .772  4.8  3.0  1.0  .3  11.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Indiana  43  43  35.6  .454  .283  .792  5.7  2.6  1.1  .2  14.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Indiana  82  82  36.0  .476  .424  .834  5.2  3.5  1.0  .4  19.1 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Indiana  18  14  27.5  .401  .356  .815  3.8  2.4  .7  .5  15.1 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Indiana  67  15  22.2  .410  .318  .842  3.5  1.5  .6  .2  9.9 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Indiana  61  44  27.6  .462  .402  .800  4.5  1.7  .7  .5  11.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Milwaukee  55  3  26.3  .474  .399  .811  3.7  2.1  .5  .1  12.3 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Milwaukee  75  3  25.9  .442  .428  .820  3.9  1.9  .5  .5  10.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Chicago  82  61  31.5  .430  .380  .854  4.2  2.3  .8  .6  11.3 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Chicago  63  63  29.2  .435  .407  .805  3.9  1.8  .6  .3  9.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Chicago  31  30  22.7  .410  .394  .784  2.7  1.3  .5  .3  7.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Cleveland  23  2  15.9  .400  .351  .737  2.0  .9  .3  .1  4.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  30  0  15.8  .438  .429  .846  2.3  1.0  .3  .2  5.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Career  986  585  27.7  .441  .377  .803  4.3  2.2  .7  .3  11.2 ===Playoffs=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2011  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Indiana  5  0  14.4  .350  .300  .667  1.2  1.6  .8  .0  5.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2013  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Milwaukee  4  0  22.8  .567  .438  .889  4.0  2.0  .5  .0  12.3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2014  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Chicago  5  5  32.6  .472  .462  .667  3.6  2.4  .6  .2  13.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2015  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Chicago  12  12  32.4  .489  .482  .947  4.0  2.6  .8  .4  10.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2017  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Atlanta  6  0  8.8  .429  .400  1.000  .8  .3  .2  .0  2.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Career  32  17  24.0  .480  .451  .840  2.9  1.9  .6  .2  8.8 ==References== ==External links== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American basketball scouts Category:American men's basketball players Category:Atlanta Hawks players Category:Basketball players at the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Oregon Category:Basketball players from Texas Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:Cleveland Cavaliers players Category:Duke Blue Devils men's basketball players Category:Golden State Warriors draft picks Category:Golden State Warriors players Category:Golden State Warriors scouts Category:Indiana Pacers players Category:Jesuit High School (Beaverton, Oregon) alumni Category:McDonald's High School All- Americans Category:Milwaukee Bucks players Category:Parade High School All- Americans (boys' basketball) Category:People from Mequon, Wisconsin Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Beaverton, Oregon Category:Sportspeople from Fort Worth, Texas ","title":"Mike Dunleavy Jr."},{"id":"1423790","text":"Woodchester is a Gloucestershire village in the Nailsworth (or Woodchester) Valley, a valley in the South Cotswolds in England, running southwards from Stroud along the A46 road to Nailsworth.

He was a student of Agnolo Gaddi in Florence. Gaddi trained under his father, called Taddeo Gaddi, who trained with Giotto. Cennini was born in Colle di Val d'Elsa, Tuscany. After training as an artist with Agnolo Gaddi in Florence he worked at the court of Francesco Novello da Carrara in Padua for some years before apparently returning to Colle di Val d'Elsa. He is remembered mainly for having authored Il libro dell'arte. Thought to have been written around the turn of the 15th century, the book is a \\"how to\\" on late Medieval and early Renaissance painting. It contains information on pigments, brushes, drawing, panel painting, the art of fresco, painting on fabrics and casting, amongst other techniques and tricks. Cennini also mentions oil painting in passing, which was important for dispelling the myth, propagated by Giorgio Vasari and Karel Van Mander, that oil painting was invented by Jan van Eyck (although Theophilus (Roger of Helmerhausen) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, On Divers Arts, written in 1125). The dates of Cennini's life are highly speculative. It is often falsely assumed that he was alive in 1437 because that date appears on the earliest of the four extant copies of his manuscript. However, an administrative document from Colle di Val d'Elsa dated 1427 probably refers to his son; if this is the case then the document makes it clear that Cennini was dead by this time. The techniques Cennini describes range from ones which were already in use in the 13th century to ones which were innovative in the late fourteenth century. However, there is no evidence in his writing of the exciting developments in oil painting taking place in the early 15th century, suggesting that his book was written not long after the turn of the century. The extent to which Cennini intended to provide a practical handbook for the apprentice painter is disputed. Some scholars believe that his book was a presentation book or a guild book instead. Along with technical methods, Cennini offered advice on the sort of lifestyle to which a young painter should subscribe. \\"Your life should be arranged just as if you were studying theology, or philosophy, or other theories, that is to say, eating and drinking moderately, at least twice a day, electing digestible and wholesome dishes, and light wines; saving and sparing your hand, preserving it from such strains as heaving stones, crowbars, and many other things which are bad for your hand, from giving them a chance to weary it. There is another cause which, if you indulge it, can make your hand so unsteady that it will waver more, and flutter far more, than leaves do in the wind, and this is indulging too much in the company of women.\\" According to Victoria Finlay, in her book Colour: Travels Through The Paintbox, the infamous UK forger, Eric Hebborn was greatly influenced by Cennino Cennini. The last book Hebborn wrote before he was brutally murdered was The Art Forger's Handbook. Finlay writes that he \\"used and adapted Cennino's advice extensively - preparing panels, tinting papers different colours, and making brand new works look as if they had been varnished some time before (by beating egg-white, left overnight and then applying it with a brush), just as the master advised.\\" ==Editions and translations== * *Cennini's Treatise of Painting - was translated by Mary Philadelphia Merrifield in 1844.Mary Merrifield, Oxford Dictionary of Biography, Retrieved 6 November 2015 *Broecke, L.

This decorative groom’s veil can be made either out of flowers or beads and is tied to the groom’s turban or Pagdi. The sehra has 2 main purposes: They are intended to ward off the evil eye. Secondly, the bride and groom are not supposed to see each other before their wedding ceremony. Therefore, a sehra solved the purpose of hiding the groom’s face, whereas the bride covered her face with a ghunghat or pallu. They are more prominently worn in North India than in other parts of the country. == History and origin == It originates from Mughal Muslim culture in the Northern part of the Indian Subcontinent wherein white flower strings were tied to the turban or Pagdi and suspended to cover the groom’s face, just like the bridal ‘Ghoonghat’ or veil. For the Sikh grooms, this tradition dates back to the times of Guru Govind Singh who added flower strands to the Pagdi or turban which added an element of pride and prestige, adopted from the practices of Punjabi Muslims. Amongst Muslims the sehra has been patronized and imbibed in the Islamic culture since the Mughal era where kings wore elaborate looking head gears encrusted with precious pearls and stones during their weddings. In fact, the word ‘Sehra’ literally means a poem sung during a ‘nikah’ or in other words the wedding ceremony in the Islamic culture. == Sehrabandi == The act of tying the sehra around the groom's head right before he leaves for the bride's house is called \\"Sehra Bandi\\". Typically the groom's sisters, female cousins, Bhabhi or sister-in-law are the essential performers of Sehra Bandi. In the case of multiple sisters or female relatives, each woman takes a turn to perform the ritual one by one. While carrying out this whole custom, all the women sing traditional wedding songs. Usually, women in the family perform the ritual in a hierarchical order based on the relation with the groom. For example, it begins with the groom's mother, the oldest sister, younger sister, oldest sister-in-law and so on. == Types of Sehra == Usually Sehras are of two main types. The traditional sehra was made of flowers however nowadays beaded sehras are equally popular. Fresh floral Sehra: This is the traditional sehra which is made up of flowers. Bejewelled Sehra: This is made up of fancy jewels, stones and pearls. ==References== Category:Bangladeshi clothing Category:Indian clothing Category:Pakistani clothing Category:Pakistani wedding Category:Indian wedding clothing Category:Bangladeshi wedding ","title":"Sehra (headdress)"},{"id":"1423812","text":"The Hellenic Railways Organisation or OSE ( or ) is the Greek national railway company which owns, maintains and operates all railway infrastructure in Greece with the exception of Athens' rapid transit lines. Train services on these lines are run by TrainOSE S.A., a former OSE subsidiary. In addition OSE owns and maintains the rolling stock used by TrainOSE and maintains preserved special rolling stock, withdrawn locomotives and railcars. OSE was founded in 1971,Law 674/1971, Government Gazette A-192/1970 taking over from the Hellenic State Railways, which was founded in 1920. Network of the Hellenic Railways: main, secondary, under construction. ==Primary rail network== As in most European Union countries, administration of the railway infrastructure is separate from the railway operating companies using the network to provide passenger and freight transportation services. Up until November 2010, company EDISY S.A. was the actual manager of the Greek national railway infrastructure until it became a subsidiary of OSE. . EDISY S.A., Athens, 2006. Specifically on 29 November 2010 EDISY S.A. was merged back into the parent company OSE S.A., which is today the manager of the rail infrastructure of Greece.Greek Government Gazette issue TAE-EPE 13557/2010-11-29, pages 1–2 (ΦΕΚ ΤΑΕ-ΕΠΕ 13557/2010-11-29) The major lines of the Greek railway network consist of the mostly electrified standard gauge double track line from Athens to northern Greece-Thessaloniki, a single track electrified line from Thessaloniki to Idomeni (at the border with the Republic of North Macedonia) and the mixed- gauge line from Athens to Peloponnese. Almost all other lines link directly with these two lines. The main line of the Greek Railway System from Athens to Thessaloniki, covers a distance of . According to the 2007 Network Statement, the total length of the standard gauge lines was approximately , while the length of the metre gauge lines (excluding Krioneri–Missolonghi–Agrinio line) is about . In addition, about of new standard gauge lines towards Athens Airport and to replace metre gauge lines, became fully operational in July 2007. ===Piraeus – Athens Central Station=== Piraeus is served by two terminals. One at Piraeus Harbour (Πειραιεύς Λιμήν, ), which up until 2006 was used by some standard gauge trains for Chalkis, Thessaloniki, and Alexandroupolis. The short line to Agios Ioannis Rentis is closed and as of 2009 being renovated. The heavy rolling stock repair works (Piraeus Central Factory, Κεντρικό Εργοστάσιο Πειραιώς — ΚΕΠ) are located at Lefka (), next to Ergostasio halt, and are accessible from this line. The other Piraeus mainline station (Peloponnese Station, ) was used by the Peloponesse metric line trains until 2005, when it was converted to standard gauge, reopening in 2007 and today serving the Proastiakos rail service. The two lines from Piraeus meet just outside Agios Ioannis Rentis (AIR) marshalling yard (). Next to the marshalling yard lies the major rolling stock depot and maintenance facility of OSE (MAI). North of AIR, the line crosses Kifissos River and then passes through the freight and parcels handling station of Rouf. At a siding of Rouf station, there is a \\"railway theatre\\" in disused rolling stock and a disused SEK class Μα \\"2-10-2\\" steam locomotive made by Breda (). The line between Rouf and Athens Central (Larissis Station) is single track and non-electrified. There is considerable traffic on this stretch as it serves the busy Proastiakos commuter rail service and regional rail service to Thessaloniki and Halkida (Chalkis); as well as other destinations served by Athens. ===Athens – Larissa – Thessaloniki=== OSE's previous logo used from January 1971 to November 2003. This logo is still used as a secondary logo although it is widely displayed on rolling stock and stations, but is slowly replaced with OSE's current logo. In 1916 the railway from Athens to Platy was completed, linking Athens with the European railway network. The line passes through Thebes and Larissa, and offers connections to several other cities (Chalcis, Lamia, Volos, Trikala) through branch lines. At Platy the line joins with the line from Thessaloniki to Amyntaio, Kozani, and Florina. The line continues across flatland until the suburbs of Thessaloniki are reached at Sindos. Larissa and Thessaloniki have substantial marshalling yards for both goods and passenger trains. There are daily InterCity (IC) trains from Athens to Thessaloniki and one night train. The InterCity (IC) rail service usually takes 4 hours and 23 minutes from Athens to Thessaloniki and 4 hours and 10 minutes from Thessaloniki to Athens. ===Athens – Corinth – Kiato - Patras=== Work in progress between Corinth and Kiato, April 2007. This section is now in use. The new Corinth line branches off at SKA and runs west into Elefsis and the Megara Plains. The line passes through impressive tunnels and bridges in the \\"Kakia Skala\\" area, north of Agioi Theodoroi; while crossing the Corinth Canal over a new bridge and then into the New Corinth Station. The line extends up to the village of Rodadaphni. Currently, the service is carried by DMU trains between Kiato and Aigio, where passengers can change to TrainOSE bus services to Patras. Passengers in Kiato chan choose also TrainOSE bus services to reach Patras. There is work in progress to extend the line to Rio (Bozaitika area), while plans exist to extend the line to Patras. Electrification of the line up to Rio is in plan as well. ===Thessaloniki – Idomeni=== This is a single track electrified line, connecting Thessaloniki with Idomeni, near the border with the Republic of North Macedonia. It is mostly used by international freight. ==Secondary rail network== ===Thessaloniki – Edessa – Amyntaio – Kozani / Florina=== Vodena (today Edessa) station in 1899 This line was opened in 1894, and connects Thessaloniki with the city Bitola, in the southern part of North Macedonia. It passes through Platy, Veroia, Edessa, Amyntaio, and Florina. At Amyntaio the Kozani–Amyntaio railway branches off. The section between Thessaloniki and Platy is part of the important connection towards Athens and southern Greece. The part across the border with Macedonia is not used anymore, and passenger traffic has been suspended west of Edessa. ===Thessaloniki – Alexandroupoli – Svilengrad=== Pythio station, where OSE's network connected to that of Turkish State Railways (TCDD) until February 2011 This railway line, 620 km long, joins Thessaloniki via the Port of Alexandroupoli to Svilengrad in Bulgaria, passing through or near most major cities of East Macedonia and Thrace (Serres, Drama, Xanthi, Komotini). At Strymon, the line connects with a northbound line along Strymon River Valley to Promachonas, which then joins with the Bulgarian network at Kulata. The line section from Stavroupoli to Toxotes runs along Nestos River Valley and is part of a preserved area that is not accessible by road. From Alexandroupolis, the line continues northwards, where it runs alongside the Evros River, that marks the border between Greece and Turkey. A junction is located at Pythio, where a line continues east and crosses into Turkey towards Istanbul. On the Greek side, the line continues north over the Karaağaç cut off to Ormenio, the northernmost village of Greece. There the line crosses to the Bulgarian border town of Svilengrad. The distance from Alexandroupolis to Ormenio is 178 km. ===Lianokladi - Stylis=== A railway line which joins Stylida with Lamia and Lianokladi. ==Thessaly Rail Network== ===Larissa – Volos=== Volos station (1892) designed by Evaristo De Chirico. The , single-track branch line from Larissa to the port of Volos (61 km) was completed in 1960 along the route of a former line. It branches off the Athens–Thessaloniki mainline at Larissa crossing the Northern part of the Thessalian Plain to Velestino, formerly a junction with the now disused Volos–Palaiofarsalos section. From Velestino it descends rapidly to the port of Volos, initially running parallel to the abandoned metre gauge line and then diverging through Melissiatika. Volos was the terminus for both lines, and also for the Pelion railway to Milies. Engine sheds and marshalling yards at Volos are home to many abandoned relics of the Greek railway system. There is a regular service on this line. Volos station is one of the very rare stations that serves three different gauges of railway line, notably standard gauge, metre gauge, and gauge. ===Palaiofarsalos – Kalabaka=== The West Thessaly single track line to Kalabaka, recently converted to , branches off the Athens–Thessaloniki mainline at Palaiopharsalos. The line serves the cities of Karditsa and Trikala, the towns of Sofades and Kalambaka; and the tourist attraction of Meteora. In the past, this line was part of a line from Velestino to Kalabaka, crossing the main line at Palaiofarsalos. The eastern section to Velestino, still metre gauge, is maintained by enthusiasts as a heritage railway. ==Peloponnese metre gauge network== Peloponnese network belonged since its construction to the former Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways or SPAP () until 1962 when they were merged to Hellenic State Railways or SEK ().Official webpage of Greek railways infrastructure – Piraeus-Athens-Peloponnese railways (greek) All passenger service on the metre gauge network in the Peloponnese (except the Diakofto Kalavrita Railway) was suspended in 2011. Some special passenger trains are able to run on demand of tour operators. === Athens – Corinth – Kiato (metre gauge) === Corinth’s first railway station, ca 1910 The old metre gauge Piraeus–Patras railway line of Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways, which ran from Piraeus, Athens to Corinth, now remains in operation only between Agioi Anargyroi and Corinth for departmental and freight services. The track from Piraeus to Agioi Anargyroi has been removed. It is double-track between Agioi Anargyroi and Elefsis (near Athens), while for the rest of its remaining section it is single and non- electrified. After Ano Liosia, the line runs north and west of the Aegaleo mountain range into Eleusis and onwards to the Megara plain. After nine km it reaches Kakia Skala, running between the old and new highways. It then continues between the mountain and the sea, passing next to the Corinth Refinery, crossing the Corinth Canal into the Peloponnese and on into the Old Station in Corinth on the Southern banks of the Gulf of Corinth. A short branch line at Isthmos leads to the town of Loutraki. === Kiato – Patras === The line to Patras runs through attractive scenery along the south side of the Gulf of Corinth, the northern coast of the Peloponnese. At Diakofto, a seaside resort between Corinth and Patras, there is a junction with the Diakofto Kalavrita Railway, a gauge rack and pinion line which climbs to a height of 720 m during a 22 km journey to Kalavryta through the Vouraikos Gorge. This line is known to Greeks as the \\"Odontotos\\" (\\"The train with teeth\\"). The main line continues alongside the gulf, passing to the north of Aigio and on to Patras. The Patras train station is situated next to the port near Othonos- Amalias Avenue. An old steam locomotive, c. 1900, lies to the east. The engine sheds and rolling stock depot are located to the northeast next to Norman Street. A freight marshalling yard is near Agios Andreas, although there are no longer freight services on the metric line. Services on this section were suspended on 17 August 2009 due to work in progress for the line regaugung to standard gauge.Circular no 3619759/4 August 2009 (urgent) by EDISY S.A., Timetables Department (in greek). TrainOSE announced that services will be reinstated on the western part of the line (Diakopto-Patras) on 27 September 2009. A bus service currently serves major stations between Kiato and Patras with no set end date for the service and the works on the line as of July 2010. === Patras – Lechaina – Pyrgos – Olympia === Rail section currently specified for Greek metre gauge lines, mass 31.57 kg/m. The line Patras–Kato Achaia–Lechaina–Amaliada–Pyrgos–Olympia is about 150 km long and runs through the prefectures of Achaia and Ilia. The train runs to the east of Akti Dymaion and alongside the Gulf of Patras between the old and the new highways as far as Kato Achaia, where it passes along the bed of the ravine, 4 km from GR-9/E55 to Lappa. The route then runs to the north of forested land, passing into Nea Manolada, then west of the highway to Lechaina. There used to be a junction with the Kavasila–Kyllini/Loutra Kyllinis branch line here, but this branch has since been abandoned. The line continues southwest to Kardamas and then into Douneika, moving away from the hills before reaching Pyrgos. It passes Pyrgos to the north, shortly branching left to the south west, leaving the main line for Kyparissia and Kalamata. The track runs into the hills, passing through Varvasena and then into the terminus at Olympia. === Pyrgos – Katakolo === Another 13 km branch line, originally operated by a separate company Σιδηρόδρομος Πύργου–Κατακώλου (Pyrgos–Katakolo Railway), opened in 1883 to link Pyrgos with the port of Katakolo. This line had its own terminal in Pyrgos. Later, in 1951, this railway was taken over by SPAP and trains were diverted into the SPAP station. The line was modernised in 2007 and is used for a limited passenger service. ===Pyrgos – Kalo Nero – Kyparissia/Zevgolatio=== The line runs along the bed of the Alpheus river, east of GR-9/E55, then through Zacharo and into the plain westward with a few forested hills northwest of Kaiafa. It runs for most of its length west of the highway, passing into Zacharo and through Neochori and Tholon. At Kalo Nero, the main line turns east and runs inland, joining Corinth–Argos–Tripoli–Kalamata line at Zevgolatio while a short branch continues south from Kalo Nero down the coast to Kyparissia. === Corinth – Argos – Nafplion – Tripoli – Kalamata === Stadler GTW-2/6 trainsets represent the latest rolling stock on Peloponnese narrow gauge network. The line branches off from the Athens–Corinth–Patras line, one km west of Corinth Old Station, with a spur entering the Corinth New Station. The line passes through Argos, where there is a branch line of ten km from Argos to Nafplion. It continues on to Tripoli and Lefktro, where a short branch line connects Megalopoli to the main line. In Zevgolatio, the line joins the line from Pyrgos–Kyparissia and continues on to Kalamata. This line used to continue from the main station of Kalamata to the old station of \\"Kalamata Limin\\" (Kalamata Harbour), now used as an open air railway museum, and it came to an end at the Port of Kalamata. Track of this last section from Kalamata main station to the port still exists but is no longer in use. Work is in progress on this line, especially between Tripolis and Kalamata, and details are liable to change. Passenger services on the section between Corinth, Argos, Tripolis, and Nafplion resumed on 1 August 2009. === Messene – Kalamata === Messene station in the beginning of October 2007, after the Kalamata – Messene service was reopened 21 September 2007. This single-track line is a branch of the Corinth–Argos–Tripoli–Kalamata line and is 4.7 km long. The branch starts at Asprochoma then the track follows the GR-82 road closely on the southern side. The line was opened in 1892 and linked Kalamata with Messene where a station building and a freight yard were built. It was closed in 1976, but the tracks were not removed. The line was rebuilt and reopened in September 2007. From 2013 to 2016, there is an occasional operation, from 20 until 28 September, during the Messene's festival and to the Christmas period until 10 January. ==Other lines== ===Diakofto–Kalavryta Railway=== The Diakofto–Kalavryta rail line is a historic gauge rack railway in Greece. Located on the northern Peloponnese, it runs 22 km from Diakofto through the Vouraikos Gorge and the Mega Spilaion monastery and up to Kalavryta, stopping en route at Zachlorou. The line was built by the Piraeus, Athens and Peloponnese Railways (SPAP). Currently the infrastructure and rolling stock are owned and maintained by the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE). The line climbs from sea level to 720 m in 22.3 km with a maximum gradient of 17.5%. There are three sections with Abt system rack for a total of 3.8 km. Maximum speed is 40 km/h for adhesion sections and 12 km/h for rack sections. ===Pelion Railway Line=== The gauge 27 km line from Volos to Milies, a distance of 28 km, was constructed between 1903 and 1906 by the Italian engineer Evaristo De Chirico. The railway was first opened in 1906. It is an independent line, not a continuation of the one metre gauge Volos to Kalambaka line. Although abandoned in the 1970s, it has been restored from Ano Lechonia to Milies. A twice weekly \\"tourist train\\" operates during the summer on Saturdays and Sundays. This is occasionally headed by one of the two restored 2-6-0 steam locomotives. The train climbs to a height of 450 metres during its 22 km journey from Ano Lechonia, a journey which takes one and a half hours. The old station at Milies has been converted into a restaurant with guest rooms. When all three gauge railways were operating from Volos, this gave the station the unique distinction of being terminus to three different gauges of railway. The Pelion railway played a major role in the economic development of the Pelion region. The stations that serve this line are rarely operational, but they still exist.2-4-0 Tubize steam engine (1903) \\"VOLOS\\" leaving Milies Station, Pelion. ===Athens – Airport Line=== In 2004, a new line was inaugurated running from Acharnai (SKA) junction to Athens International Airport \\"El Venizelos\\". Between Iraklio and Koropi, the new line runs along a closed motorway (Attiki Odos), along the general direction of the old Lavrio line, but displaced east. The line is double-track and electrified with 25;kV overhead catenary. When the planned extension from Koropi to Lavrio is built, it will probably follow the old Lavrio line more closely. ==Abandoned lines== === Paleofarsalos – Velestino – Volos === Palaiofarsalos station in 1995 This was formerly a line throughout its length from Volos to Kalampaka. However, the track from Paleofarsalos to Kalampaka/Meteora is now . The remainder of the metre gauge line from Paleofarsalos to Velestino is no longer in use, though in part it is maintained as a heritage railway by the non-profit Company for Museum Railways (Εταιρεία Μουσειακών Σιδηροδρόμων) or EMOS (ΕΜΟΣ). EMOS now operates a Linke- Hoffman DMU on loan from OSE, an old Nippon Saryo diesel locomotive, formerly of Aliveri Lignite Mines and various rail cars. They also own and plan to return to operational condition a Jung steam locomotive, while other rolling stock shall remain as display items (a Tubize steam locomotive, a Breda railbus etc.). === Kavasila – Vartholomio – Kyllini === Railbus in Kyllini in 1981 This branch line, part of the SPAP network, served the port of Kyllini, from which ferries sail to Zakynthos Island. Services on this branch started in August 1891 and lasted until 1988, with full services and with limited services until 1996, when the line was closed down. This line also included the 10.8 km branch Vartholomio–Loutra Kyllinis railway line, which opened in June 1892 and closed down in 1969. === Kryoneri – Missolonghi – Agrinio === This metre gauge line that was opened in the 1890s linked the small port of Kryoneri with Missolonghi and Agrinio. A short branch from Aitoliko to Katochi was in operation from 1912 to 1940. From Kryoneri to Patras, a ferryboat service was provided. The expense of the ferry, the increase in private car traffic, and the hostility of local authorities led to the closure of the line for passenger traffic in 1970 and for departmental traffic in 1975. In the 1990s, a plan to restore and reopen the line was started. The track was modernised and work finished in 2003, but passenger services have not been restored, due to lack of personnel and rolling stock. === Other === A number of lines were closed before 1971 and subsequently the track was lifted. They include Sarakli-Savros, Angista-Ampipolis, Alexandroupolis bypass, Skydra- Almopia and Herakleion Kule-Xeropotamos.: Contains a map of Hellenic Railways in 1940–1941. ==Planned lines== Igoumenitsa-Ioannina-Kalampaka Kalampaka- Kastoria Florina-Pogradec Kalampaka-Kozani Thessaloniki-Kavala-Toxotes Ioannina-Rio Thessaloniki-Chalkidiki Thessaloniki-Giannitsa-Skydra Chania- Rethymnon-Herakleion CreteΤο τρένο θα σφυρίξει στην Κρήτη Thessaloniki- Igoumenitsa (On March 8, 2016 an intergovernmental agreement between Greece and Turkey for reconnecting the Istanbul to Thessaloniki line was signed.

He was a scholar sometimes known as The Father of Finnish History. ==Biography== He was born at Viitasaari in Tavastland, Finland. Parents were Sigfrid Porthan and Kristina Juslenius. His father was a vicar who became mentally ill in 1744. He was raised by his uncle Gustaf Juslenius (1702-1774) who was the vicar of Kronoby in the county of Ostrobothnia. In 1754, at the age of 15, Porthan entered the Royal Academy of Turku (now University of Helsinki). He was a student of professor Daniel Juslenius (1676–1752) who later served at Bishop of the Diocese of Borgå. Porthan was awarded his Master of Philosophy in 1760. In 1762, he became an associate professor. He was a professor 1777–1804 and served as rector 1786–1787 and 1798–1799. He became a Fennophile and brought Finnish history-writing, study of mythology and folk poetry, and other humanistic sciences to an international level. His De Poësi Fennica (published in five parts 1776-78), a study on Finnish folk poetry, had great importance in awakening public interest in the Kalevala-poetry and Finnish mythology, and the study was also the basis of all later study of the poetry.Juha Y.

Her father, Bessarabian-born Leon (Lipa) Halfin, migrated to Belgium in 1929 from Chişinău. Her mother was Greek-born Liliane Nahmias, a Holocaust survivor. 18 months before Fürstenberg was born, her mother was a prisoner at Auschwitz concentration camp. Fürstenberg has spoken broadly about her mother's influence in her life, crediting her with teaching her that \\"fear is not an option\\". Fürstenberg attended a boarding school in Oxfordshire. She studied at Madrid University before transferring to the University of Geneva to study economics. She then moved to Paris and worked as an assistant to fashion photographer's agent Albert Koski. She left Paris for Italy to apprentice to the textile manufacturer Angelo Ferretti in his factory, where she learned about cut, color and fabric. It was here that she designed and produced her first silk jersey dresses. ==Career and brand== Diane von Fürstenberg during New York Fashion Week. A year after marrying, Fürstenberg began designing women's clothes: \\"The minute I knew I was about to be Egon's wife, I decided to have a career. I wanted to be someone of my own, and not just a plain little girl who got married beyond her deserts.\\" After the Fürstenbergs separated in 1973, Egon also became a fashion designer. After moving to New York, she met high-profile Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, who declared her designs \\"absolutely smashing\\". She had her name listed on the Fashion Calendar for New York Fashion Week, and so her business was created. In 1974, she introduced the knitted jersey \\"wrap dress\\", an example of which, due to its influence on women's fashion, is in the collection of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Amanda Christine Miller,\\"Diane von Furstenberg On Wrap Dresses And The Joys Of Aging Gracefully\\", HuffingtonPost.com, 28 March 2008.

In 1992, Fürstenberg sold $1.2 million dollars of her Silk Assets collection in two hours on QVC. She credits the success with giving her the confidence to relaunch her company. Fürstenberg relaunched her company in 1997, and reintroduced the wrap dress, which gained traction with a new generation of women. In 1998, she published her business memoir, Diane: A Signature Life. In 2004, she introduced the DVF by H. Stern fine jewelry collection, and launched scarves and beachwear.

La Dame aux Camélias premiered at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris, France on February 2, 1852. The play was an instant success, and Giuseppe Verdi immediately set about putting the story to music. His work became the 1853 opera La traviata, with the female protagonist, Marguerite Gautier, renamed Violetta Valéry. In the English-speaking world, La Dame aux Camélias became known as Camille and 16 versions have been performed at Broadway theatres alone. The title character is Marguerite Gautier, who is based on Marie Duplessis, the real-life lover of author Dumas, fils. ==Summary and analysis== Marie Duplessis painted by Édouard Viénot Illustration by Albert Lynch Written by Alexandre Dumas fils (1824–1895) when he was 23 years old, and first published in 1848, ' is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's brief love affair with a courtesan, Marie Duplessis. Set in mid-19th-century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois., Marguerite is nicknamed ' () because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for making love and a white camelia when she is available to her lovers. Armand falls in love with Marguerite and ultimately becomes her lover. He convinces her to leave her life as a courtesan and to live with him in the countryside. This idyllic existence is interrupted by Armand's father, who, concerned with the scandal created by the illicit relationship, and fearful that it will destroy Armand's sister's chances of marriage, convinces Marguerite to leave. Until Marguerite's death, Armand believes that she left him for another man. Marguerite's death is described as an unending agony, during which Marguerite, abandoned by everyone, regrets what might have been. The story is narrated after Marguerite's death by two men, Armand and an unnamed frame narrator. Some scholars believe that both the fictional Marguerite's illness and real life Duplessis's publicized cause of death, \\"consumption\\", was a 19th-century euphemism for syphilis, as opposed to the more common meaning of tuberculosis. , is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand, and the suffering of the two lovers, whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times, is rendered touchingly. In contrast to the 's love for Manon in Manon Lescaut (1731), a novel by Abbé Prévost referenced at the beginning of ', Armand's love is for a woman who is ready to sacrifice her riches and her lifestyle for him, but who is thwarted by the arrival of Armand's father. The novel is also marked by the description of Parisian life during the 19th century and the fragile world of the courtesan. ==Stage performances== Eugénie Doche created the role of Marguerite Gautier in 1852 Eleonora Duse as Marguerite Gautier, late 19th century Dumas wrote a stage adaptation that premiered February 2, 1852, at the Théâtre du Vaudeville in Paris. Eugénie Doche created the role of Marguerite Gautier, opposite Charles Fechter as Armand Duval. \\"I played the role 617 times,\\" Doche recalled not long before her death in 1900, \\"and I suppose I could not have played it very badly, since Dumas wrote in his preface, 'Mme. Doche is not my interpreter, she is my collaborator'.\\" In 1853, Jean Davenport starred in the first United States production of the play, a sanitized version that changed the name of the leading character to Camille—a practice adopted by most American actresses playing the role. The role of the tragic Marguerite Gautier became one of the most coveted amongst actresses and included performances by Sarah Bernhardt, Laura Keene, Eleonora Duse, Margaret Anglin, Gabrielle Réjane, Tallulah Bankhead, Lillian Gish, Dolores del Río, Eva Le Gallienne, Isabelle Adjani, Cacilda Becker, and Helena Modrzejewska. Bernhardt quickly became associated with the role after starring in Camellias in Paris, London, and several Broadway revivals, plus the 1911 film. Dancer/Impresario Ida Rubinstein successfully recreated Bernhardt's interpretation of the role onstage in the mid-1920s, coached by the great actress herself before she died. Of all Dumas, fils's theatrical works, La Dame aux Camélias is the most popular around the world. In 1878 Scribner's Monthly reported that \\"not one other play by Dumas, fils has been received with favor out of France\\". ==Adaptations== ===Opera=== Fanny Salvini-Donatelli, the first Violetta in La traviata (1853) The success of the play inspired Giuseppe Verdi to put the story to music.

Zeffirelli first approached Hussey about starring in the film a few weeks after the premiere of Romeo and Juliet (1968). He sent her a copy of the original book with a note that said “You are my Marguerite Gautier”. The two year long publicity tour for Romeo and Juliet (1968), stalled the project as Hussey and Zeffirelli traveled the world to promote the film. After the tour, Zeffirelli had trouble finding finances and a studio for the project. Meanwhile, Hussey starred in All The Right Noises (1971), got out of an abusive relationship with Christopher Jones, and later married Dean Paul Martin in 1971. In 1972, Zeffirelli directed the film, Brother Sun Sister Moon (1972), which failed to live up to the success of Romeo and Juliet (1968), and prevented him from finding a studio to pick his proposal for Camille. Hussey, believing that the film was off, starred in Summertime Killer (1972) and Lost Horizon (1973), and had her first child in February of 1973. Zeffirelli tried one last time to get the film picked up in late 1973, but this time without Hussey. Given the overwhelming negative reception of Hussey’s recent film, Lost Horizon, she wasn’t seen as the same box office draw as she was a few years earlier. Unbeknownst to Hussey, Zeffirelli recruited recent Oscar winner (and best friend to Hussey), Liza Minnelli, for the role of Marguerite Gautier. Even with Minnelli’s Oscar winning name attached to the proposal, no studio showed interest in the project. For blindsiding her, Hussey’s relationship with Zeffirelli and Minnelli tumbled for sometime (particularly with Liza). Olivia said of the situation “I was stunned. Liza and I would often talk about work, and I had told her how excited I was to play Marguerite Gautier. How it was the role of a lifetime, and how Franco would bring it to life. I had said that he was a genius and I loved him and that he was adapting the work with me in mind. It was like I was handing it to her, the way I described it. I felt betrayed. I understood that having an Oscar-winning name like Liza’s attached would help Franco get the picture made. Directors, in my experience, will do anything to get a project off the ground, and I really couldn’t blame him (although in my heart I did). But Liza? How could she go behind my back like that? She wouldn’t even have known about Camille if I hadn’t talked it up.” Franco Zeffirelli’s vision of Camille ultimately never came to fruition. Olivia would later rekindle her relationship with Franco, and even reunited with him for the film Jesus of Nazareth a few years later. On the other hand, her relationship with Minnelli didn’t have the same mending. Hussey recalled “she called from Rome to apologize and smooth things over. It was big of her, but I found myself being nasty, telling her that Franco must be thinking of doing the film as a comedy if he were willing to cast her in the role. It was a terrible thing to say, and I felt awful afterward, but I was hurt and angry...Liza and I did find our way back to being friends, although it was never quite the same.” ===Ballet=== * Lady of the Camellias is a ballet by John Neumeier with music by Frédéric Chopin, created for Marcia Haydée, then prima ballerina of the Stuttgart Ballet. It premiered at the Staatstheater Stuttgart in 1978. * Lady of the Camellias is a ballet by Val Caniparoli with music by Frédéric Chopin. It premiered with Ballet Florida at the Raymond Kravis Center in 1994. * Marguerite and Armand is an adaptation created in 1963 by renowned choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton specifically for Rudolf Nureyev and prima ballerina assoluta Dame Margot Fonteyn. * Veronica Paeper created a ballet Camille based on The Lady of the Camellias which has been staged several times since 1990. ===Stage=== Amongst many adaptations, spin- offs, and parodies, was Camille, \\"a travesty on La Dame aux Camellias by Charles Ludlam, staged first by his own Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1973, with Ludlam playing the lead in drag. In 1999 Alexia Vassiliou collaborated with composer Aristides Mytaras for the contemporary dance performance, La Dame aux Camélias at the Amore Theatre in Athens. It is also the inspiration for the 2008 musical Marguerite, which places the story in 1944 German- occupied France. ===Novels=== In My Ántonia by Willa Cather, the characters Jim Burden and Lena Lingard are much moved by a theatrical production of Camille, which they attend in book 3, chapter 3. Love Story, published by Eric Segal in 1970, has essentially the same plot updated to contemporary New York. The conflict here centres on the relative economic classes of the central characters. ==References== ==External links== * Full texts at Project Gutenberg in the original French and in an English translation *1953 Best Plays radio adaptation of play at Internet Archive Category:1848 French novels Category:1852 plays Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:French novels adapted into plays Category:Novels adapted into operas Category:Novels adapted into ballets Category:French romance novels Category:Novels about French prostitution Category:Novels set in Paris Category:Novels by Alexandre Dumas fils Category:Female characters in literature ","title":"La Dame aux Camélias"},{"id":"1423852","text":"Public Services Centre, High Street, Omagh, January 2010 Strule Arts Centre, Townhall Square, Omagh, January 2010 Omagh District Council was a local council in Northern Ireland.

It is located on the Northumberland Strait at the Abegweit Passage, the shortest crossing between Prince Edward Island and the mainland. It once flourished as a transportation hub between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island but has been in decline since 1997 when the ferry service was closed due to the opening of the Confederation Bridge. At the Canada 2011 Census the population was 108, three quarters what it was at the 2006 census. Cape Tormentine is named for the eponymous cape. As an unincorporated community, it is part of the Bayfield local service district. For the purpose of Statistics Canada's census it is in Botsford Parish. ==Freight and passenger terminal timeline== * 1827: the Northumberland Strait iceboat service, known as the Capes Route, begins operating across the strait to Cape Traverse, Prince Edward Island (PEI). * 1873: under the terms of PEI joining Canadian Confederation, the federal government is obliged to provide \\"continuous steamship service\\" between the mainland and the island, and keep the iceboats running. * 1886: the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Railway connects Cape Tormentine with Sackville, New Brunswick and thence to the Intercolonial Railway of Canada's Moncton to Truro line. * 1917: the iceboats are replaced by an ice breaking train ferry, the SS Prince Edward Island, built by Armstrong Whitworth in England and operated by Canadian Government Railways. A new port was built to accommodate the ferry. She was an effective ice breaker, and could carry 12 interprovincial rail cars. * 1947: The ferry is replaced by the MV Abegweit. She measures 372 feet in length and displaces 7,000 tons. Her eight main engines generate 13,500 brake horsepower and drive propellers at both bow and stern. She could carry 950 passengers and 60 cars (or one complete passenger train of 16 railway cars). * 1968: a second ferry, MV John Hamilton Gray is put in service on the PEI route. * 1982: a new Roll-on/roll- off ferry, also called the MV Abegweit replaces the first. She is a much larger and more capable vessel, measuring 401 feet in length and displacing 12,000 tons. Her six main engines generated 18,000 brake horsepower. She could carry 974 passengers and 250 cars (or 40 tractor trailer trucks or 20 railway cars). * 1989: the last train stops at Cape Tormentine on New Year's Eve, following the closure of the Prince Edward Island Railway and the branch to Sackville. This branch has since been converted into a leisure trail, known locally as the Tantramar trail. * 1997: with the opening of the Confederation Bridge between PEI and nearby Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick the ferry service is ended. Northumberland Ferries Limited still operates a service on the Northumberland Strait, between Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island and Caribou, Nova Scotia.

The Pulaski is a special hand tool used in fighting wildfires which combines an axe and an adze in one head. Similar to a cutter mattock, it has a rigid handle of wood, plastic, or fiberglass. The Pulaski is used for constructing firebreaks, able to both dig soil and chop wood. It is also well adapted for trail construction, and can be used for gardening and other outdoor work for general excavation and digging holes in root-bound or hard soil. The axe blade of the Pulaski is the primary cutting edge, while the adze blade is secondary; this is the opposite of the cutter mattock, in which the adze blade is the larger of the two. The invention of the Pulaski is credited to Ed Pulaski, an assistant ranger with the United States Forest Service, in 1911, although similar tools were first introduced in 1876 by the Collins Tool Company, a tool that serves the same purpose was used in the Alps for over 300 years for planting trees (Wiedehopfhaue) or the Dolabra in Ancient Rome. Pulaski was famous for taking action to save the lives of a crew of 45 firefighters during the disastrous August 1910 wildfires in Idaho. His invention (or reinvention) of the tool that bears his name may have been a result of the disaster, as he saw the need for better firefighting tools. Pulaski further refined the tool by 1913, and it came into use in the Rocky Mountain region. In 1920 the Forest Service began contracting for the tool to be commercially manufactured but use remained regional for some years. The tool became a national standard in the 1930s. Raising the tool above the user's head while swinging may, according to one author, waste energy and create a safety hazard. An initialed (\\"E.P.\\") tool, which purportedly belonged to Pulaski himself, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution at the Wallace District Mining Museum in Wallace, Idaho. Aside from a knife, the only tool that was issued to the participants in the American reality series Naked and Afraid aired March 24, 2019 on the Discovery Channel show was a Pulaski. ==See also== * Driptorch * Fire flapper (tool) * Fire rake * Flare * Halligan bar * McLeod (tool) * Pickaroon ==References== ==External links== * Category:Firefighter tools Category:Forestry tools Category:Mechanical hand tools Category:Wildland fire suppression equipment ","title":"Pulaski (tool)"},{"id":"1423871","text":"Strabane District Council (; Ulster-Scots: Stràbane Destrìck Cooncil)Snapshot: The magazine of Strabane District Council was a local council in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland established by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972.

A Game Boy Advance port was announced in 2001 but it was never released. The game places players in the role of a child named Andy as he attempts to rescue his dog who has been kidnapped by shadow-like spectres. The game has about half an hour of storytelling cinematic sequences, thousands of 2D animated frames, and uses pre-rendered background scenery. The game was supervised by game developer Éric Chahi, known for Another World, this time with a team of artists and developers. The game also features an original score by film and television composer Bruce Broughton. ==Gameplay== Heart of Darkness is a cinematic platformer in the vein of Eric Chahi's previous game Another World in which players control Andy, who faces various dangers in search of his dog, Whisky. Players progress through the game's linear storyline by navigating various environments and solving puzzles, all whilst attempting to keep Andy from being killed by evil shadows, hungry wildlife, and perilous obstacles. Along with basic movement, such as running, jumping, and climbing, certain sections of the game give Andy additional abilities. The plasma cannon allows Andy to shoot lightning at shadows in order to disintegrate them. The Special Powers, which can also be used offensively against enemies, can additionally be used to grow and destroy trees born from seeds. The player has unlimited tries, with Andy returning to the most recent checkpoint when he is killed. ==Plot== The game begins with the protagonist; a young boy known as Andy being abused by his teacher for sleeping in class where it is revealed that he has nyctophobia (fear of the dark). Being instructed that same day by his teacher to watch the solar eclipse, Andy takes his beloved dog Whisky to the park where dark forces steal Whisky away, prompting Andy to use his assortment of inventions and machines to get him back. Andy travels to another world called the Darkland in a homemade spaceship which promptly crashes and he has to face an assortment of obstacles to rescue Whisky and find his way home. Throughout the game, Andy is tasked with fighting living shadow creatures and dark monsters while traversing several hostile alien environments such as a canyon, swamp, underwater cave, and lava river. He receives help in this quest from a peaceful alien race called Amigos whom he befriends, and from magic powers he obtains from a meteor referred to as the 'magic rock.' The main antagonist is an evil sorcerer known as the Master of Darkness who intended to capture Andy instead of his dog. Somewhat resembling Andy's teacher from the beginning of the game, the Master of Darkness has an interest in capturing Andy and sends his minions to pursue him. Another major antagonist is the Vicious Servant; a sniveling pink creature that serves the Master but is quick to betray him for personal benefit. After traveling across the varying alien environments and fighting alongside the Amigos, Andy finds himself inside the Master of Darkness' lair where he proceeds to free Whisky and join forces with the Vicious Servant to help overthrow the Master of Darkness. Planning to use the magic rock's power to destroy the black hole at the lair's center. However, Andy is double-crossed by the servant who kicks Whisky into the black hole and sends Andy into an ambush. Andy ends up fending off droves of shadow creatures and successfully following through with his plan, but falls into the black hole himself along with the Master of Darkness as the structure around him collapses. The black hole's center is the heart of darkness and there Andy must fight the Master and face his fears once and for all. Upon succeeding the darkness dissipates and Andy awakens in his treehouse, believing the experience was all just a dream but after Andy and Whisky go to sleep and it's shown Andy has likely gotten over his fear of the dark, the player is shown the Amigos cleaning up the wreckage of Andy's ship and proving the adventure was perhaps real. ==Development and release== Heart of Darkness suffered a protracted development cycle marked by numerous delays and changes in platform. Development began in 1992, with the PC as the lead platform. The game was not publicly unveiled until the March 1995 European Computer Trade Show, at which time the developers said it was near completion. A version for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was announced, but the game spent so long in development that by the time it was finished, the 3DO (which was not even launched until a year after development on the game began) was no longer commercially viable. A version for the Amiga CD32 was also in development but never released. An Atari Jaguar CD version was also announced in July 1994, with internal documents from Virgin Interactive Entertainment stating that Amazing Studio showed interest in starting development on the conversion, but work on the port never moved forward beyond proposition. In 1996 Sega signed a deal for the console version to be a Sega Saturn exclusive, with the PC version to be held off until after the Saturn version was released. A release date of October 1996 was announced with the Saturn version, but as this date approached the publisher announced that the game would not be ready until late 1997. Sega Saturn Magazine commented at the time that \\"this is quickly becoming a joke of a situation. The game looked absolutely amazing when it was first sighted at an ECTS trade show a year or three ago, but unless it has radically changed from its sighting at E3 [in May 1996], it's going to be out- dated and out-quaffed by its contemporary software.\\" With further delays, the Saturn was also no longer a commercially viable platform by the time Heart of Darkness was finished. In a 2015 interview with Eurogamer, Éric Chahi said Heart of Darkness was one of his most difficult projects due to the transitions \\"from working alone to working with a team in the context where the industry was really changing with the CD-Rom coming, the PC and with 3D arriving.\\" Virgin Interactive Entertainment dropped funding for the project in December 1996, but the team chose to persevere with making the game. Frederic Savoir explained that \\"we couldn't throw away four years of our life. We didn't care what it took.\\" After nine months of work without funding, the game was demoed at the September 1997 European Computer Trade Show, leading Interplay to adopt it. A version for the Panasonic M2 was also in the works, but never happened due to the system's cancellation. The game's cutscenes were rendered using 3D Studio. According to Chahi, the team did consider using Silicon Graphics workstations, but found that the improvement over 3D Studio was not enough to justify the expense of the workstations or having to restart the work on the cutscenes. Chahi and Chris Delaporte created the game's textures themselves rather than using the 3D Studio texture library. The characters were sketched in different poses, then built with both 3D Studio and different paint programs on a PC. Then the characters were rendered for the cutscenes and scaled down as game sprites. The sprites were animated with Deluxe Paint and Deluxe Animator. ==Reception== Game Informer reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it 8.25 out of ten and said \\"Does the game still live up to all the hype that it garnered years ago? Yes, but it's not the monster that it used to be. The FMV scenes that blew us away are now old news and slightly outdated, but 'Heart of Darkness' still has a killer bite in two other categories. For one, the story and how it is integrated into the gameplay is outstanding, and we can honestly say that it is one of the few titles out there with a perfect balance of cinema and game. Heart of Darkness also kicks you in the rear with the gameplay itself\\" Complete Playstation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five and said \\"HOD is an excellent side-scrolling platform game that brings us back to the great days of instant and addictive gameplay, but with graphics far superior to anything on any 16-bitter.\\" IGN rated the game 7.8 out of ten stating \\"The platforming experience here is tremendous, because the puzzles and actions never repeat, and the worlds are vast and eccentric. But what really pushes you to complete the game is the compelling, well-paced storyline.\\" Gamespot reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it 7.1 out of ten and stated that \\"Heart of Darkness isn't a bad game.

He is a founding member of rock band Midnight Oil on drums, percussion and backing vocals (sometimes lead vocals) from the 1970s until the band took a hiatus in 2002. The band resumed activity as a group in 2017. Hirst also wrote a book, Willie's Bar & Grill, recounting the experiences on the tour Midnight Oil embarked on shortly after the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001. ==The Midnight Oil Years (1976–2002, 2017-present)== In the early 1970s schoolboys Rob Hirst and close friends Jim Moginie and Andrew \\"Bear\\" James played their first public performance in a school hall in Sydney's leafy northern suburbs under the name Schwampy Moose playing mainly Beatles covers. By 1976 the band had changed their name to Farm, and Hirst, now a student at University of Sydney (BA/LLB), placed an advertisement in The Sydney Morning Herald for a singer to join the trio. The new line up of Peter Garrett (lead vocals), Hirst (drums and vocals), Moginie (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and James (bass guitar) was joined soon after by Martin Rotsey on guitar and their manager and sixth member Gary Morris. The band changed their name to Midnight Oil. With a blistering intensity to their live performances, the band's early music was a unique brand of surf punk. However, by the early 1980s the key songwriters in the band, Hirst, Moginie, and Garrett, had become increasingly interested in the political issues of the day. This had a significant influence on their song writing and soon spilled over into their live performances as the dynamic and outspoken Garrett used the stage as a platform for the band's views on issues including Aboriginal rights, nuclear disarmament and social justice. In 1979 James left to be replaced by Peter Gifford. In 1987, after touring the outback and recording the band's best-known album Diesel and Dust, Gifford suffered ill health and resigned. New bass player Bones Hillman (formerly of New Zealand band The Swingers) brought a new vocal dimension to the band. Midnight Oil continued to record and tour internationally for a further 15 years, chalking up a final tally of fourteen albums and two extended plays before lead singer Garrett quit the group in December 2002, taking up a career in politics. The band have resumed activity as of 2017, including undertaking a 2017 world tour. ==Side projects and post-Midnight Oil== ===Ghostwriters=== In the mid-1990s, while Midnight Oil were taking a break, Hirst joined up with guitarist Andrew Dickson and Hoodoo Gurus bass guitarist Rick Grossman to form a side project, Ghostwriters. So far, the band has released four albums, Ghostwriters (Virgin Records, 1991), Second Skin (Mercury Records, 1996), Fibromoon (self-released, 2000), and Political Animal (SonyBMG Australia, 2007). ===Backsliders=== In the year 2000, Hirst joined Backsliders, an Australian Blues group formed in 1986 whose members include founding member Dom Turner and harmonica players Brod Smith, Ian Collard and Joe Glover. The line-up with Hirst has released six studio albums, one EP and a live DVD. ===Other musical projects=== Turner and Hirst formed another band in 2002, the Angry Tradesmen, with the idea of taking the guitar/drum music of North Mississippi and blending it with drum/bass music of the 1990s and experimental post-punk rock. Their only album Beat the House was released in 2008 and featured studio performances by Midnight Oil's Martin Rotsey. Hirst and Rotsey also play on the track \\"All Around the World\\" on Jim Moginie's 2006 solo album Alas Folkloric. Other musical collaborations have included working with Australia's Olympic athletes on a record commissioned by SOCOG for the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and an unrelated collaboration with former Olympic athlete, Paul Greene. Hirst and Greene have released an album, In the Stealth of Summer, and a DVD, Hirst and Greene - Live at the Basement. In 2010 Hirst, Moginie and Rotsey teamed up with Violent Femmes bass player Brian Ritchie and Hunters & Collectors trumpet player Jack Howard to form a new surf rock band, The Break. Their debut album, Church of the Open Sky, was released on 16 April 2010 on the independent label Bombora, distributed by MGM. A tour of Australia followed. Their second album, \\"Space Farm\\", was released on 15 March 2013,iTunes again followed by an Australian tour. In 2015, Hirst collaborated on music with his eldest daughter Jay O'Sheahttp://m.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/country-music-star-jay-oshea- discovers-her-birth-father-is-midnight-oils-rob-hirst/story- fnic6ynx-1227139439474 of the band O'Shea. Hirst had given Jay up for adoption at a young age and it was through her birth mother and Rob's bandmate from Midnight Oil Bones Hillman that the two eventually connected. The song The Truth Walks Slowly is the second time Rob has collaborated with his children after previously having his younger two daughters complete backing vocals on his solo album. ==Personal life== Hirst has three daughters. He has two daughters with his wife, Leslie Holland. One of his daughters, Gabriella Hirst, is an artist. He also has another daughter, Jay O'Shea, who was born to a former girlfriend and was later adopted. They reunited in 2010 and have subsequently collaborated.http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/country-music- star-jay-oshea-discovers-her-birth-father-is-midnight-oils-rob-hirst/news- story/d8d4e37e1c17f0d4ecf771dd3308c6a4 ==Discography== ===With Midnight Oil=== ====Studio albums==== *Midnight Oil (1978) *Head Injuries (1979) *Place without a Postcard (1981) *10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (1982) *Red Sails in the Sunset (1984) *Diesel and Dust (1987) *Blue Sky Mining (1990) *Earth and Sun and Moon (1993) *Breathe (1996) *Redneck Wonderland (1998) *Capricornia (2002) ====Extended plays==== *Bird Noises (1980) *Species Deceases (1985) *The Dead Heart (1986) ====Live albums==== *Scream in Blue (1992) *The Real Thing (2000) *Best of Both Worlds (2004) ===With Ghostwriters=== *Ghostwriters (1991) *Second Skin (1996) *Fibromoon (2000) *Political Animal (2007) ===With Backsliders=== ====Studio albums==== *Hanoi (2002) *Left Field Holler (2007) * Starvation Box (2011) * Dark Side (2014) * Heathen Songbook (2016) Live albums *Live (2005) ====Extended plays==== * Throwbacks (2009) ===With Hirst & Greene=== *In the Stealth of Summer (2005) ===With Angry Tradesmen=== *Beat the House (2008) ===With The Break=== *Church of the Open Sky (2010) *Space Farm (2013) ===Solo=== *The Sun Becomes the Sea (2014) ===With O'Shea=== *The Famine and the Feast (2015) ===With Powerful Owls=== *Powerful Owls (2018) ==References== ;General * Note: Archived on-line copy has limited functionality. * Note: on-line version established at White Room Electronic Publishing Pty Ltd in 2007 and was expanded from the 2002 edition. ;Specific ==External links== *Rob Hirst website *Midnight Oil website *The Ghostwriters website *The Ghostwriters on MySpace *The Backsliders website *The Angry Tradesmen website *Hirst and Greene website *The Break website Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian rock drummers Category:Male drummers Category:Midnight Oil members Category:People educated at Sydney Grammar School ","title":"Rob Hirst"},{"id":"1423888","text":"An event is described as standing room only when it is so well-attended that all of the chairs in the venue are occupied, leaving only flat spaces of pavement or flooring for other attendees to stand, at least those spaces not restricted by occupancy by fire codes for ingress/egress of crowds. Some venues issue standing-room-only (or SRO) tickets for a reduced cost since it can become uncomfortable to stand through the course of an event.Attending an Opera and Information for Newcomers However, some fans prefer standing-room- only tickets as the crowds that gather can be more active than people who are sitting down for much of the event. For example, standing-room only areas known as terraces are very common at football matches around the globe and tickets sold as standing area tickets are sometimes the most popular; i.e., they are not sold merely when all seating tickets have been sold out. However, the periodic occurrence of tragedies related to standing room only areas at football matches such as at Hillsborough and Guatemala City have led to calls to eliminate such arrangements.Thomsen, Ian. \\"Vantage Point : Tragedy in Guatemala: FIFA Must Face Up to Its Duties\\" International Herald Tribune In England, standing room, once a staple of most football stadiums there, has been practically eliminated at the highest level; all of the major stadiums have been refurbished as all-seaters. There is a now move towards the provision of safe standing areas, providing bolt-on, fold-away or rail seats. By contrast, standing room tickets are rare at major sports stadiums in the United States and Canada, with only the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T; Stadium, the Washington Football Team's FedExField and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats' Tim Hortons Field having such permanent arrangements, though they are usually marketed as part of a 'party deck' where the price of a ticket may come with food and drink along with obstructed picnic table-style seating, and with other amenities to encourage fans to purchase those tickets. The Green Bay Packers have also tested out the standing room concept in 2014 in a select section after the completion of renovations at Lambeau Field. The Little League World Series uses standing room and berm seating at its events, with its flagship venue, Howard J. Lamade Stadium, able to accommodate 12 times as many spectators on its berms (over 40,000) than it does in the 3,300-seat ballpark proper. Standing tickets are a key feature of the annual London concert season The Proms, with up to 1,350 \\"Promenaders\\" buying cheaper tickets to stand in unreserved space in the arena and gallery of the Royal Albert Hall. ==References== Category:Sports venues Category:Entertainment venues ","title":"Standing-room only"},{"id":"1423891","text":"SRO may refer to: * Saudi Railways Organization (SRO) * Standing-room only, an event in which all seats are occupied leaving only places to stand * S.R.O.

He is best known for his work with Midnight Oil, of which he was a founding member, guitarist, keyboardist and leading songwriter. In addition to Midnight Oil, Moginie has worked and performed with many notable musicians from Australia and New Zealand, including Silverchair, Sarah Blasko, End of Fashion, Neil Murray, Kasey Chambers and Neil Finn. Moginie has also played live with his band The Family Dog comprising different members at times, including Trent Williamson, Kent Steedman, Paul Loughhead and Tim Kevin. He has also released three solo works. The four-track EP Fuzz Face was recorded in Moginie's small home studio with Midnight Oils' producer Nick Launay and released in 1996, with fellow Midnight Oils bassist Bones Hillman contributing under the pseudonym \\"The Family Dog\\" – a term that Moginie would later use for his live band. Alas Folkloric (2006) is Moginie's first full-length solo album and first release after Midnight Oil disbanded. The album features contributions from Martin Rotsey and Rob Hirst, as well as Paul Dempsey in Something for Kate on the track \\"Halfway Home\\", and was released through the Virgin Music label. No Vans Mary by Shameless Seamus (Moginie's folk pseudonym) was released in 2010 and featured guest musicians including flugelhorn player Elizabeth Geyer with whom he subsequently co-wrote songs with. His interest in the traditional music of Ireland has deepened and his 7 piece band Shameless Seamus and The Tullamore Dews released the live in the studio Ballroom of Romance CD in 2012. Both are available through the Reverberama label. Moginie also sings and plays bouzouki and guitar with a smaller group, The Tinkers, with core members Alan Healy (tenor banjo, bouzouki, vocals) and Evelyn Finnerty (fiddle, vocals) .

Publisher's details. See also: * \\"The idea for the IWF was to provide a conservative alternative to feminist tenets.\\" * \\"However, our visitor from another planet would be surprised to discover there are many groups out there that represent conservative women who believe in equality but shun socialism and big government. One of those organizations is the Independent Women's Forum.\\" * \\"In this article I examine two national conservative women's organizations—the Concerned Women for America (CWA) and the Independent Women's Forum (IWF)—to show how conservative women leaders link gender identity and policy preferences. I describe these organizations below. Like feminists, these women, through their organizations, not only act collectively as women, but also bring a \\"woman's perspective\\" to policy issues. Although some scholars have not denied the impact of right-wing movements on feminist goals and activities (Conover & Gray, 1983; Klatch, 1987; Marshall, 1995), others have characterized conservative women as victims of false consciousness, pawns of conservative men or right-wing funders (Dworkin, 1983; Hammer, 2002), or women's auxillar[ies] of the conservative elite\\" (Kaminer, 1996), thus diminishing the attention and serious consideration appropriate to such a political force.\\" IWF was founded by activist Rosalie Silberman to promote a \\"conservative alternative to feminist tenets\\" following the controversial Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas in 1992. IWF's sister organization is the Independent Women's Voice (IWV), a 501(c)(4) organization. The group advocates \\"equity feminism,\\" a term first used by IWF author Christina Hoff Sommers to distinguish \\"traditional, classically liberal, humanistic feminism\\" from \\"gender feminism\\", which she claims opposes gender roles as well as patriarchy. According to Sommers, the gender feminist view is \\"the prevailing ideology among contemporary feminist philosophers and leaders\\" and \\"thrives on the myth that American women are the oppressed 'second sex.'\\" Sommers' equity feminism has been described as anti-feminist by critics. Excerpt. ==Origin and history== Founded in 1992 by Rosalie Silberman, Anita K. Blair, and Barbara Olson, the IWF grew out of the ad hoc group \\"Women for Judge Thomas,\\" created to defend Clarence Thomas against allegations of sexual harassment and other improprieties. By 1996 the organization had some 700 dues-paying members who met regularly at luncheons to network and share ideas. Silberman was the IWF's first president; subsequent leaders have included Nancy Pfotenhauer and Anita Blair. The current president of the organization is Carrie Lukas. The IWF has been described as \\"a virtual 'Who's Who' of Washington's Republican establishment.\\" In 2006, the organization had 20,337 members and a budget of $1.05 million. ==Advocates Equity Feminism== The IWF opposes many mainstream feminist positions, describing them as \\"radical feminism\\", but rather focuses on equity feminism. IWF-affiliated writers have argued that the gender gap in income exists because of women's greater demand for flexibility, fewer hours, and less travel in their careers, rather than because of sexism. In an article for the Dallas Morning News, IWF Vice-President Carrie Lukas attributed gender disparities in income to \\"women's own choices\\", writing that women \\"tend to place a higher priority on flexibility and personal fulfillment than do men, who focus more on pay. Women tend to avoid jobs that require travel or relocation, and they take more time off and spend fewer hours in the office than men do. Men disproportionately take on the most dirty, dangerous and depressing jobs.\\" The IWF also argues that feminists manufacture domestic violence legislation that \\"is misleading because it is premised on and mean to advance feminist ideology.\\" This falls under their larger belief that \\"feminists ... lie about data, are opportunistic, construct men as the enemy, and cast women as helpless victims.\\" Conservative commentators have praised the IWF; Linda Chavez credited Women's Figures: An Illustrated Guide to the Economic Progress of Women in America, a 1999 book published in part by the IWF, with \\"debunk[ing] much of the feminists' voodoo economics.\\" Writing in Capitalist Magazine, John Stossel cited Michelle Bernard's 2007 book Women's Progress as evidence that \\"American women have never enjoyed more options or such a high quality of life.\\" Some writers have asserted that feminist rhetoric is used by the IWF for anti-feminist ends. A New York Times editorial described the IWF as \\"a right-wing public policy group that provides pseudofeminist support for extreme positions that are in fact dangerous to women.\\" ==Domestic policy and programs== ===United States healthcare policy=== In 2009, IWF produced a political advertisement run on YouTube and in eight states arguing that \\"300,000 American women with breast cancer might have died\\" if U.S. healthcare included a government-funded option. FactCheck.org labeled the IWF ad false and manipulative of women's fears, finding that the IWF ad relied on \\"old statistics, faulty logic and false insinuations.\\" ====Title IX enforcement==== Since shortly after the organization's inception, the IWF has joined with groups like the National Wrestling Coaches Association in opposing the manner in which the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has enforced Title IX gender equality legislation. The 1972 Title IX law that states: \\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\\" ====Campus programs==== The organization emphasizes traditional family roles and cultural norms as essential for civil society. In particular, IWF encourages young women to embrace what it presents as a healthy attitude towards dating, courtship, and marriage. Pdf. This emphasis is reflected by high-profile, sometimes controversial work on college campuses where IWF sponsors advertising campaigns and literature distribution to promote its views. One such effort included the running of advertisements with provocative headings such as \\"The Ten Most Common Feminist Myths.\\" IWF also offers internships and sponsors an annual essay contest open to full-time female undergraduate students. As a reaction to reports of growing promiscuity on college campuses and the V-Day movement founded by Eve Ensler, IWF created its \\"Take Back the Date\\" campus program to \\"reclaim Valentine's Day from radical feminists on campus who use a day of love and romance to promote vulgar and promiscuous behavior through activities like The Vagina Monologues.\\" Specifically addressing the controversial play, IWF's \\"Take Back the Date\\" release states that, \\"although the play raises money for a good cause, the hyper-sexualized play counteracts the positive contributions of the feminist movement and degrades women.\\" In an article in The Guardian, Jessica Valenti wrote that the program was merely \\"[r]evamping outdated notions of femininity and positioning them as cutting edge.\\" ==International programs== Condoleezza Rice speaking to an IWF audience in 2006 after receiving the organization's \\"Woman of Valor\\" award Since its founding, IWF has sponsored numerous conferences, panels, and other programs designed to promote its message to an international audience. These primarily include activities and events discussing or taking place in the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan, and focus on promoting female participation in democracy. The IWF has also had a hand in international women's programs and initiatives. For example, \\"in the spring of 2002, the IWF's President, Nancy Pfotenhauer, was appointed by U.S. President George W. Bush to be a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.\\" In October 2004, the Feminist Majority Foundation objected to the U.S. Department of State's decision to award part of a grant to IWF. IWF's work in Iraq is in concert with that of the American Islamic Conference and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a neo- conservative think tank. ==Funding== Donors to IWF have included Donors Trust, the John William Pope Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundations, the Randolph Foundation, and the John M. Olin Foundation. ==Board members== IWF Chairman Heather Higgins appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, 2006 The board is chaired by businesswoman Heather Higgins with other members Yvonne Boice, Kellyanne Conway (temporary leave of absence), Giovanna Cugnasca, Nan Hayworth, Larry Kudlow, and Adele Malpass.

The school is housed in Richcraft Hall, on Carleton's campus in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Students, alumni and faculty of NPSIA are referred to as NPSIAns ( ). NPSIA is Canada's oldest school of international affairs, founded during what is commonly considered a golden age of Canadian diplomacy. The school offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of global issues, divided into eight fields. In 2007, a poll of Canadian academics, intended to determine the best professional masters programs in international affairs, ranked NPSIA at No. 2, tied with Georgetown University, and ahead of programs at universities like Harvard and Columbia. A 2019 survey of Canadian academics in international affairs confirmed NPSIA as the most recommended school in Canada for students seeking a career in policy. NPSIA is a founding member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a group of public policy, public administration and international affairs schools. ==History== ===Creation of the school=== Carleton University President Davidson Dunton announced the creation of a graduate school of international affairs on February 18, 1965. The school was established, in part, due to a $400,000 grant from Senator Norman Paterson. Paterson, a businessman who made his fortune in the shipping and grain industries, was also a member of Carleton’s Board of Governors, and had previously donated $500,000 to Carleton. At the time of its creation, the new graduate school was called the \\"School of International Affairs.\\" It was renamed in 1974 to honour its principal financial benefactor, Senator Paterson. Classes began at the School of International Affairs in September 1966. The first director of the school was Norman Robertson, a distinguished public servant and diplomat. Prior to his appointment at the school, Robertson had served variously as Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to Cabinet, Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and twice as the Under-secretary of External Affairs. Robertson did not enjoy teaching and was reportedly not an effective teacher. Enrolment at the School in the early years numbered over 30. ===Lester Pearson=== The school acquired its most prominent faculty member in 1968 with the appointment of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson as a lecturer. The newly opened school was a natural fit for Pearson, who had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for trying (without significant impact) to end the Suez conflict. Senator Paterson later contended that the creation of the school and thoughts about how Pearson would spend his retirement were \\"intimately bound together in [the Senator’s] mind.\\" Pearson had turned down multiple teaching offers from schools in the United States before beginning his appointment at the School on July 1, 1968, only months after stepping down as Prime Minister. At the school, Pearson taught a three-hour seminar on foreign relations, with a particular focus on collective security. Though Pearson’s teaching style was largely informal, he took his commitment as a professor seriously, making up missed seminars even as his health began to fail. Pearson once even declined an invitation from U.S. President Richard Nixon to dine at the White House on account of his teaching duties. Pearson also enjoyed engaging with students, though he was apparently not an easy marker and seldom saw fit to make comments on students’ work. Pearson also used his time at Carleton to work on his memoirs, until he died in 1972. Pearson is buried in the same cemetery as his friend, and the school's first director, Norman Robertson. Following his death, friends of Pearson raised funds to establish the Lester B. Pearson Chair of International Affairs at the school. The first person to hold the chair position was Arnold Cantwell Smith, a Canadian diplomat who served as Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. ===1970s and 1980s=== NPSIA made the news in 1978 because of a brief controversy after Philip Uren, a Carleton professor of geography, accepted a paid trip from the government of South Africa to speak and conduct research. This was controversial given the government of South Africa's Apartheid policy. The NPSIA Faculty Council was concerned that Uren had represented himself as speaking on behalf of Carleton University, and passed a resolution censuring Uren for damaging NPSIA’s reputation. The incident was complicated by the fact that Uren also served as the director of the Paterson Centre, Carleton’s administrative centre for international exchanges. His dual role as professor and administrator sparked a debate over academic freedom, and how that freedom should extent to faculty serving in administrative roles. Uren eventually resigned as director of the Paterson Centre, though he remained a geography professor at Carleton. NPSIA first published its \\"Canada Among Nations\\" series in 1984. The annual series brings together leading members of the international affairs community for an assessment of the country’s foreign policy. The books are used in university courses on foreign policy and international relations, and \\"have become a major publication of record on Canada’s policies and actions in the world.\\" The volumes, which include topics such as arms control, climate change, and international political economy, have often been edited by prominent NPSIA faculty members, including by Maureen Appel Molot, Brian Tomlin, Fen Osler Hampson, Norman Hillmer, Jean Daudelin and Dane Rowlands. ===21st century=== In 2008, former Canadian diplomat William Barton donated $3 million to the school to establish the William and Jeanie Barton Chair in International Affairs. The chair honours Barton, who served as President of the UN Security Council during Canada's lead in the 1970s, and his wife Jeanie. The first and current chair holder is Trevor Findlay. NPSIA moved from its traditional home on Carleton's campus in Dunton Tower to the new River Building in 2012. The school's new space includes a new resource centre named in honour of William and Jeanie Barton. The resource centre contains computers, printers, workrooms, unique reference material including past theses by NPSIAns, and a balcony on the top floor of the River Building. The resource centre is accessible only to NPSIA students, staff and faculty. Dr Yiagadeesen (Teddy) Samy is the current director of NPSIA, having succeeded Dr Dane Rowlands in 2017. Prior to Dr Rowlands' tenure the position was held by Dr Fen Hampson; Dr Hampson's term as director ended in 2012. ==Graduate programs== International affairs is not a major available to undergraduate students, although the school does offer a handful of courses open to upper-year students at the Arthur Kroeger College of Public Affairs. The school offers three different Masters level programs, and one PhD level program. ===Master of Arts=== The Master of Arts in International Affairs is NPSIA's most popular degree program, with about 100 students graduating with the degree each year. The program offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of international affairs, and many of the classes are focused on policy. NPSIA's MA program is organized around eight fields: *Conflict Analysis and Conflict Resolution (\\"Conflict\\") *Intelligence and National Security (\\"INS\\") *Development Projects and Planning (\\"DPP\\") *International Development Policy (\\"IDP\\") *International Organizations and Global Public Policy (\\"IOGP\\") *International Economic Policy (\\"IEP\\") *Project Management and Humanitarian Assistance (\\"PMHA\\") *Diplomacy and Foreign Policy (\\"DFP\\") To graduate, NPSIA M.A. students must complete 5.0 full credits, including one economics course, at least one cluster course and the introductory methods course. Students must also demonstrate an intermediate knowledge of a major second language. For instance, in French, students must meet the B1 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. ===PhD=== The PhD program at NPSIA requires that students complete at least 10 full credits, which includes the 4.5 credits worth of dissertation work. The PhD program has three fields of study: *International Conflict Management and Resolution *International Development Policy *International Economic Policy ===Joint and dual degrees=== NPSIA offers an M.A./JD degree in conjunction with the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Law. Students must apply to both the JD and the M.A. programs separately and gain admission to each program to be admitted into the joint program. M.A./JD students do one year at UOttawa before completing their second year at NPSIA. The school has also partnered with Carleton's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering to offer the Master of Infrastructure Protection and International Security (MIPIS). This degree combines infrastructure engineering with international affairs to address issues at the nexus of national security and engineering. ==Research units and publications== As a hub of international affairs-related research, NPSIA houses a number of different research centres. Each is a unique body tasked with producing research on a specific topic or collection of related topics. Many NPSIA professors are actively involved in these research centres. NPSIA is affiliated with the following research centres: *The Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies (CCISS) *The Canadian Centre for Treaty Compliance (CCTC) *Centre for Security and Defence Studies (CSDS) *Centre for Trade Policy and Law (CTPL) In addition to these research units, the school is home to two academic journals. The first, the Canadian Foreign Policy Journal, is a peer-reviewed journal traditionally published three times per year. Founded in 1992, the journal offers analysis of foreign policy issues from a Canadian perspective, and many NPSIA faculty members have been published in the journal. The second journal that NPSIA houses is the Paterson Review of International Affairs, a student-managed journal that publishes the best articles submitted by graduate students in international relations, political science and related fields. Formally called E-merge, the journal publishes once a year and is edited by a staff of NPSIA students. NPSIA is also well known for publishing Canada Among Nations, a biannual survey of Canadian foreign policy and Canada's involvement in the international community. The text has come to be incorporated in many university courses and is widely read by policy makers. ==Student life== The NPSIA Students’ Association seeks to holistically address the needs of NPSIA students. Through biweekly meetings under the leadership of the co-presidents, the Students’ Association works to be a liaison between the NPSIA faculty/administration and the student body; to plan social, academic, and professional events; to support students in their academic and professional pursuits; and to open and facilitate lines of communication between NPSIA students, staff, faculty, and alumni–as well as with the Ottawa community and other student groups and associations with an interest in international affairs. ===Benefit soirée=== The NPSIA Benefit Soirée, usually referred to as \\"Soirée\\", is an annual benefit dinner put on by first year MA students since 1997. The goal of Soirée is to raise awareness of a key global issue while connecting students with important members of the international affairs community in Ottawa. Generally composed of a dinner followed by a keynote address, the event raises money for a different charity each year, and is the major event of the NPSIA social season. Past keynote speakers include Michael Ignatieff, former Governor General Michaëlle Jean, the founder of War Child Canada Samantha Nutt and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Izzeldin Abuelaish. The event is well attended by NPSIA students and professors, and by members of Ottawa's diplomatic community and the wider international affairs community. ==Notable alumni== There are over 2,000 NPSIA alumni in a wide variety of positions within the private, public and not-for- profit sectors. NPSIA alumni are represented by the NPSIA Alumni Association, which has an active chapter in Ottawa and contacts in a variety of major world cities. ===Canadian government and politics=== * Margaret Biggs, Former President of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) * Peter Boehm, Deputy Minister of International Development * Perry Calderwood, High Commissioner to Pakistanhttp://newsroom.carleton.ca/2016/07/19/two-carleton- alumni-receive-diplomatic-appointments/ * Ariel Delouya, Former Ambassador to Tunisia * Wendy Drukier, Former Ambassador to Costa Rica * Greg Giokas, Former High Commissioner to Pakistan * Elissa Golberg, Assistant Deputy Minister.

From 1980 until 1987, he played bass guitar, Chapman Stick and sang backing vocals for Australian rock band Midnight Oil. ==Midnight Oil== Gifford is credited with creating a significant part of the Oils' tight, driving sound, and has been described as being an aggressive bass guitarist. He played on the albums Place without a Postcard (1981), 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (1982), Red Sails in the Sunset (1984) and Diesel and Dust (1987), as well the EPs Bird Noises (1980) and Species Deceases (1985). Gifford joined the band in 1980 after hearing on the radio about the auditions for a replacement for bassist Andrew James, whose poor health required him to withdraw from the band. He was actually driving over the Sydney Harbour Bridge to work as a roadie at the time. The band was looking for a more aggressive style of bass playing (an 'animal' in the words of guitarist Jim Moginie). Gifford predominantly played a Fender Precision bass guitar and this can be seen in the Oils on the Water concert, performed on Goat Island in 1985. His bass solo work in live performances of \\"Stand in Line\\" was his signature. He also played the Chapman Stick on the tracks 'Sleep' and 'Who Can Stand in the Way' on the Red Sails in the Sunset album and in concert. Gifford provided many backing vocals for the band, and is credited by longtime producer Nick Launay as being a significant contributor in the recording studio. In 1987, he left the group and was replaced by Bones Hillman. ==Discography== ===With Midnight Oil=== ====Studio albums==== *Place without a Postcard (1981) *10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (1982) *Red Sails in the Sunset (1984) *Diesel and Dust (1987) ====Extended plays==== *Bird Noises (1980) *Species Deceases (1985) *The Dead Heart (1986) ====Live albums==== *Scream in Blue (1992), tracks 1, 4, 5, and 12 *Best of Both Worlds (2004) ===With Warumpi Band=== *Go Bush (1987) ===With Neil Murray (Australian musician)=== *Calm and Crystal Clear (1989), tracks 1, 2, 3 4, 6 and 8 *These Hands (1993), track 1 ==Business interests== After leaving the band, started the Byron Bay-based Wicked Weasel, a direct marketing business specialising in micro bikinis and short shorts.

It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on April 10, 1953, and held on June 9, 1953. The new legislature met for the first time on September 15, 1953. The minority government formed in 1952 by the conservative Social Credit party of Premier W.A.C. Bennett lasted only nine months before new elections were called. Social Credit was re-elected with a majority in the legislature to a second term in government with almost 38% of the popular vote. The social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation formed the official opposition with the only significant opposition caucus (14 seats). The British Columbia Liberal Party lost two of its six seats despite maintaining its 23% share of the popular vote. The Progressive Conservative Party lost three of its four seats in the legislature, as its share of the popular vote fell from almost 17% to under 6%. One seat was won by a Labour candidate. ==Results== { style=\\"width:57%; text-align:center;\\" + ↓ - style=\\"color:white;\\"  ADD8E6; width:58.34;\\"  28  EEDDAA; width:29.17%;\\"  14  A51B12; width:8.34%;\\"  4  0D5D93; width:2.10%;\\"  1  F7DBDB; width:2.10%;\\"  1 -  Social Credit  CCF  Lib  PC  Lr } { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"5\\"Popular vote - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"1952 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"First count align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"Change align=\\"center\\"Final count align=\\"center\\"% W.A.C.

The Voree plates, also called The Record of Rajah Manchou of Vorito, or the Voree Record, were a set of three tiny metal plates allegedly discovered by Latter Day Saint leader James J. Strang in 1845 in Voree, near Burlington, Wisconsin. Purportedly the final testament of an ancient American ruler named \\"Rajah Manchou of Vorito\\", Strang asserted that this discovery vindicated his claims to be the true successor of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement--as opposed to Brigham Young, whom most Latter Day Saints accepted as Smith's successor in 1844. The plates also lent credence to his claim that Voree, not the Salt Lake Valley, was to be the new \\"gathering place\\" of the Latter Day Saints. Strang's purported translation of this text is accepted as scripture by his church and some other bodies descending from it, but not by any other Latter Day Saint organization. Unlike the golden plates used by Smith to produce the Book of Mormon, the existence of Strang's plates was verified by independent, non- Mormon witnesses, including Christopher Latham Sholes, inventor of the first practical typewriter. Strang was accused of having fabricated the plates from a brass tea kettle, a claim which he and his partisans vigorously denied. The plates disappeared around 1900, and their current whereabouts are unknown. ==Discovery== 1856 daguerreotype of James Strang, taken on Beaver Island, Lake Michigan, by J. Atkyn, itinerant photographer and later one of Strang's assassins. According to Latter Day Saint beliefs, many ancient inhabitants of the Americas engraved records on metal plates. Joseph Smith, the movement's founding prophet, claimed that he translated the Book of Mormon from a set of golden plates which he was shown the location of by the then resurrected ancient keeper of the plates, Moroni. A map of old Voree, engraved on a monument at the townsite. Upon Smith's murder in 1844, a number of claimants came forward to lead his church, including Strang. As a recent convert to Mormonism, Strang did not possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons enjoyed by Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon, the two principal contenders for church leadership. Hence, Strang faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith's prophetic mantle. To advance his cause, Strang asserted that unlike Rigdon and Young, he had hard evidence of his prophetic calling. One of Smith's titles had been \\"Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and Translator,\\" and Strang wished to substantiate his claim to succession by following in Smith's footsteps. So, while Young and Rigdon never offered their followers any newly revealed ancient records, Strang announced on January 17, 1845, that God had promised to lead him to a hitherto- undiscovered chronicle of a long-lost American people.Revelation of 17 January 1845, quoted from http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm . Contains a reproduction of the plates. This, said Strang, would prove that he was Smith's true successor. Strang next testified that on September 1, 1845, an angel of God appeared to him and showed him the location of \\"the record of my people in whose possession thou dwellest.\\"Gospel Herald, May 4, 1848. Quoted from http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm . Accordingly, Strang went on September 13 to the indicated site, located in Voree, south of the White River on what is now referred to as the \\"Hill of Promise.\\" He led four witnesses to a large oak on the hillside, inviting them to examine the ground around the tree carefully before digging for the plates. All four later testified that they could discern no evidence of digging or other disturbance of the ground. After removing the tree, Strang's companions dug down approximately three feet, where they discovered three small brass plates in a case of baked clay. Strang subsequently claimed to have deciphered this record, which he said was authored by an ancient Native American named \\"Rajah Manchou of Vorito.\\"Some spell this \\"Manchore\\" instead of \\"Manchou\\". ==Appearance and dimensions== The Voree plates measured approximately 2.5 inches long, and between 1.25 and 1.5 inches wide. According to one anonymous witness, these plates were \\"about the thickness of a piece of tin, fastened together in one corner by a ring passing through them.\\"Gospel Herald, 23 September 1847. Quoted in http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm . A second viewer described them as being \\"thickly covered with ancient characters of curious workmanship.\\"Gospel Herald, 26 October 1848. Quoted in http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm . Stephen Post, the brother of Strangite apostle Warren Post, visited Strang in 1850 and examined the plates for himself, noting that \\"they were not polished very smooth before engraving, by appearance.\\" Unlike his brother, Stephen Post had trouble believing Strang's account of the plates' origin and discovery: \\"With all the faith & confidence that I could exercise,\\" he later wrote, \\"all that I could realize was that Strang made the plates himself, or at least that it was possible that he made them.\\" Post equally observed that the brass used in the Voree plates seemed indistinguishable to him from the French brass used in ordinary tea kettles. Four of the six sides of the Voree plates contained text written in an unknown script. The fifth side contained a map showing the area where the plates were found, while side one contained engravings of the \\"all-seeing eye\\" and a man holding a scepter, with the sun, moon, and stars beneath him. These images were said to represent God, the president of the church, his two counselors, the high council of the church, the apostles, and the seventies. ==Translation and testimony== Strang's published translation of the Voree Plates reads as follows: > My people are no more.The mighty are fallen, and the young slain in battle. > Their bones bleached on the plain by the noonday shadow. The houses are > leveled to the dust, and in the moat are the walls. They shall be inhabited. > I have in the burial served them, and their bones in the Death-shade, > towards the sun's rising, are covered. They sleep with the mighty dead, and > they rest with their fathers. They have fallen in transgression and are not, > but the elect and faithful there shall dwell. The word hath revealed it. God > hath sworn to give an inheritance to his people where transgressors > perished. The word of God came to me while I mourned in the Death-shade, > saying, I will avenge me on the destroyer. He shall be driven out. Other > strangers shall inhabit thy land. I an ensign there will set up. The escaped > of my people there shall dwell when the flock disown the Shepherd and build > not on the Rock. The forerunner men shall kill, but a mighty prophet there > shall dwell. I will be his strength, and he shall bring forth thy record. > Record my words, and bury it in the Hill of Promise.Zion's Reveille, April > 1, 1847. Quoted in http://www.strangite.org/Plates.htm . Strang published facsimiles of the plates.Facsimile of the Voree plates from the Strangite website. and his translation in his church's newspaper, The Voree Herald. Many Latter Day Saints found this new discovery quite compelling, and believed it to be a sure sign that Strang was indeed Smith's true successor. For those who remained skeptical or merely curious, Mormon or non-Mormon, Strang (unlike Smith) readily produced the plates themselves for personal examination. One such investigator was the non-Mormon Christopher Sholes, inventor of the first practical typewriter, and a later inspiration to Thomas Edison. As the editor of the Southport Telegraph, Sholes called upon Strang and perused his discovery. Sholes offered no opinion on the plates, but he described Strang as \\"honest and earnest\\" and opined that Strang's followers ranked \\"among the most honest and intelligent men in the neighborhood.\\"Doyle Fitzpatrick, The King Strang Story, A Vindication of James J. Strang, the Beaver Island Mormon King (National Heritage, 1970), p.36. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ, the two largest factions of the Latter Day Saint movement, both reject Strang's claims to prophetic leadership and his \\"Voree Record.\\" ==Possible additional text== According to one authoritative source, there may have been text translated from the Voree plates that Strang never made public. Strang himself had indicated more than once that he had released to his followers only \\"part of the record of Rajah Manchou of Vorito.\\" H. V. Reed, who had visited Strang and read his translation, published a possible addition to Strang's text in the Chicago Illustrated Journal in January 1873: > It shall come to pass in the latter days, that my people shall hear my > voice, and the truth shall speak from the earth, and my people shall hear, > and shall come and build the Temple of the Lord. My prophet, unto whom I > send my word, shall lead them, and guide them in the ways of peace and > salvation. In Voree the name of the Mighty One shall be heard, and the > nations shall obey my law, and hear the words of my servant, whom I shall > raise up unto them in the latter days. No official determination has been made by the Strangite church as to whether these words should be considered part of Strang's translation or not. ==Allegations of forgery== Some members of competing Restoration churches have insisted that the Voree plates were forged by Strang. Isaac Scott, an ex- Strangite, wrote to Joseph Smith III alleging that he learned from Caleb Barnes, Strang's former law partner, that he and Strang had fabricated the plates from a tea kettle belonging to Strang's father-in-law, as part of a land speculation scheme they had hatched.The Saints' Herald 35 (December 29, 1888): 831–32. According to Scott, Barnes and Strang \\"made the 'plates' out of Ben [Perce]'s old kettle and engraved them with an old saw file, and ... when completed they put acid on them to corrode them and give them an ancient appearance; and that to deposit them under the tree, where they were found, they took a large auger ... which Ben [Perce] owned, put a fork handle on the auger and with it bored a long slanting hole under a tree on 'The Hill of Promise,' as they called it, laying the earth in a trail on a cloth as taken out, then put the 'plates' in, tamping in all the earth again, leaving no trace of their work visible.” Wingfield W. Watson, a high priest in Strang's sect who knew Strang, vigorously challenged these allegations in an 1889 publication entitled The Prophetic Controversy #3.The Prophetic Controversy, No. 3; or the Even Balances by which Isaac Scott, Chancy Loomis, and the Founders of the Reorganization Are Weighted and Found Wanting. In Two Chapters (Boyne, Mich.[?]: n.p. 1889). Among other things, Watson points out that the theory advanced fails to explain how the 12\\"x12\\"x3\\" stone covering block was placed above the case containing the plates. This overlooked flaw in Isaac Scott's story would indicate that all of Scott's stories were fabricated in order to ingratiate him to the new prophet. Strang was assassinated in 1856. The Voree plates remained with his family until they disappeared sometime around 1900. Their current whereabouts are a mystery. ==Script used on the plates== The Voree plates are written in an unknown alphabet. Strang authored a personal diary during his youth, parts of which were written in a secret code which was not deciphered until over one hundred years later by Strang's own grandson. Comparison of the script used in the coded portions of Strang's diaryFitzpatrick, p. 259. and the script used on the Voree plates shows remarkable similarities between the two. Keith Thompson, of Manchester, England, alleges that the text on the plates matches Strang's published translation. Although he did not identify the values of specific characters, Thompson claimed to have shown how words such as \\"and\\", \\"in\\", and \\"are\\" appear in multiple places.Giants of Burlington: Voree Plate 1 Site also contains photos of the discovery site on the \\"Hill of Promise.\\" According to a Strangite website, Derek J. Masson, a non-Mormon scholar, reportedly argued in an unpublished 1977 paper that Strang's translation was sound. This same site alleges that a second non-Mormon scholar, Robert Madison, concluded in 1990 that the text on the plates appears to represent a genuine, albeit unknown, language, and that Strang's translation appeared to be \\"a superb (if poetic) rendition of that text into English.\\" Independent scholarly assessment of Masson's and Madison's conclusions does not exist. == See also == * List of plates (Latter Day Saint movement) ==Notes== ==External links== *The Voree Plates, Strangite site containing a large reproduction of the Voree plates, with translation and other information. *James Strang as Translator, Strangite site on the plates. *Giants of Burlington, non-Strangite website seeking to link the Voree plates to the world of psychic and UFO phenomena.

It is still often placed in the genus Parus with most other tits, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data and morphology suggest that separating Poecile more adequately expresses these birds' relationships (Gill et al., 2005). The American Ornithologists' Union had been treating Poecile as distinct genus for some time already. Adults are 12.5–13.5 cm long with a wingspan of 18–21 cm and a weight of 7.5–11 g. Both sexes have a black cap, white cheeks, and a short black bill. Their backs and flanks are gray and they have paler grayish underparts. Similar in appearance to the black-capped chickadee and mountain chickadee, the Mexican chickadee can be distinguished by its longer black bib, which extends from its chin down onto its upper breast. A whitish band below the bib extends down the center of the belly. It is a permanent resident of wooded highlands in western, central and northeastern Mexico, the range extends north into extreme southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Although primarily nonmigratory, Mexican chickadees sometimes fly to lower elevations during the cold of winter. The Mexican chickadee's song is distinct from other chickadees; it is a complex burry trilled whistle of chischu-wur and a rich cheelee. They travel in pairs or small groups, and may join multi-species feeding flocks. The nest is constructed by the female in a snag or tree cavity up to 18 m above the ground, and consists of grasses, moss, strips of bark, and is lined with animal fur. She lays between five and eight ovate white eggs, marked with fine reddish brown spots. Their breeding biology is not well known, but it is estimated that eggs are incubated for 11–14 days by the female, and the altricial young fledge in 18–21 days. ==References== * Alsop, F.

He played bass guitar in his first band the Masochists, an early New Zealand punk act, formed with friends from the Auckland suburb of Avondale (they were alternatively known as the Avondale Spiders). In late 1977 he joined the Suburban Reptiles and appeared on their first single, \\"Megaton\\" (Vertigo, 1978). The name Hillman was coined by the make of car he drove. He left the band in early 1978 and joined the former Masochists in the Rednecks, a mainstay of the legendary Zwines punk scene in Auckland. In late 1977 he joined the New Zealand band the Swingers with Phil Judd (ex-Split Enz) and Mark Hough (a.k.a. Buster Stiggs, ex-Suburban Reptiles). Their single \\"Counting the Beat\\" was a trans-Tasman number one hit before the band disintegrated in 1983. Moving to Australia as part of The Swingers in 1980 and living there until 2002, he was a member of internationally known Australian rock band Midnight Oil, replacing Peter Gifford in 1987 as bass player.Midnight Oil profile During the hiatus of Midnight Oil, Hillman returned to New Zealand, working as a studio and live musician with Dave Dobbyn and recorded the album Available Light. Hillman moved with his family to Nashville, USA, in early 2007 to participate in the more active musical scene there. In 2009, Hillman recorded albums for Anne McCue (Broken Promise Land) and Elizabeth Cook (Welder, produced by Don Was). In 2011, Hillman worked on the Musical adaptation of Diner recording tracks for Sheryl Crow. In 2014, Hillman reunited with Midnight Oil producer Warne Livesey to record songs for his new musical project the Graysmiths. In 2015, Hillman recorded and toured with Matthew Good.

The first six books were written by Julie Campbell Tatham, who also wrote the Ginny Gordon series; the stories were then continued by various in-house writers from Western Publishing under the pseudonym Kathryn Kenny. Today the rights to the series are owned by Random House. The series was out of print for a number of years, but Random House began releasing a new edition of the books in mid-2003. As of mid-2006, volumes 115 have been reissued. Beatrix \\"Trixie\\" Belden is a young teen living just outside the fictional town of Sleepyside-on-Hudson, in the Hudson Valley area of New York. She lives at Crabapple Farm, which had been in her family for either three or six generations (this varies between books), with her parents and three brothers, Brian, Mart, and Bobby. The first book establishes her friendship with lonely, sheltered rich girl Honey Wheeler, whose family has just moved into the Manor House next door and soon the girls are embroiled in their first case. Throughout the series, the two girls solve mysteries that baffled authorities and, along with brothers and friends, form a club called the Bob-Whites of the Glen, have adventures, travel (though not as extensively as Nancy Drew, an older and more sophisticated girl sleuth), and struggle with school. Trixie has particular difficulties with math. With the advent of Internet fan-supported Web sites, many Trixie Belden-related sites have been created. On many of these sites, comparisons are made between Trixie and Nancy Drew. Fans of Trixie Belden usually cite her more realistic persona as a teenager who grumbles about chores and is often frustrated by life with both older and younger brothers. Trixie also experiences some insecurity about her looks, often comparing herself unfavorably with her friends, Honey and Diana, who are regarded as more obviously attractive. ==Main characters== The ages indicated refer to each character's age at the beginning of the series. *Beatrix \\"Trixie\\" Belden: Thirteen-year-old Trixie Belden is one of the two co-presidents of the Bob-Whites of the Glen. Described as being short with a sturdy build, she has short blonde ringlets (either sandy blonde or strawberry blonde, depending on the edition) and round blue eyes. She has a tendency to jump to conclusions, but her hunches often prove to be correct. One of her chores is to take care of six-year-old Bobby and, while she loves her little brother, she often loses patience with the mischievous child. She and Honey plan to one day open their own business: the Belden-Wheeler Detective Agency. Trixie has an amazing instinct for people and can accurately judge them before she gets to know them. Her best friends are Honey Wheeler and Di Lynch. Likes Jim Frayne toward end of ninth book. *Madeleine G. \\"Honey\\" Wheeler: Depending on the book, 13-year-old Honey Wheeler is either vice-president or secretary of the Bob-Whites of the Glen. She is described as tall, slender, and pretty, with shoulder-length golden-brown hair and large hazel eyes. Until moving to Sleepyside, she spent her life in boarding schools and summer camps, barely knowing her own parents. Her friendship with Trixie and the Bob-Whites has given her more confidence and helped her to forge a relationship with her parents and adopted brother. Generally regarded as the sweetest and most tactful of the Bob-Whites, she is also their star swimmer. She now attends Sleepyside Junior-Senior High School with the rest of the Bob-Whites, where she consistently earns high marks and praise. Honey and Brian seem to like each other. *James '\\"Jim\\" Winthrop Frayne II : Fifteen-year-old Jim Frayne is the other co-president of the Bob-Whites of the Glen. The focus of the first two books, he is adopted by the Wheelers at the end of The Red Trailer Mystery, after successfully running away from his abusive stepfather. He has a Springer Spaniel named Patch. He is described as having red hair and green eyes, coincidentally the same coloring as his adoptive father, Matthew Wheeler. Jim is an expert equestrian and 'rides like a centaur'. He and Trixie are fond of each other, and Jim gives Trixie an orchid and later his ID bracelet; however, the romantic angle is downplayed in later volumes. His goal is to one day use his inheritance to build a school for orphaned boys that will combine outdoor–naturalist activities with regular scholastics. Throughout the series, there is some inconsistency regarding his age. *Brian Belden: Brian Belden, 16, is the oldest of the four Belden children. Described as dark and handsome, he is by far the most level-headed of the seven Bob- Whites and plans to become a physician after finishing school. Throughout the series, Brian often provides first aid to his sister, Trixie, as well others who are injured during the course of the Bob-Whites' adventures. Brian is smart and mature, always the voice of reason and always trying to keep Trixie out of trouble. In the fifth book, Brian gets his first car, a jalopy purchased from Mr. Lytell, a storekeeper, for 50 dollars. Brian's first aid skills stretch to caring for automobiles, as he is often shown working on his car, and also to animals as when he is given responsibility for bandaging an injured horse owned by the Wheelers. *Martin \\"Mart\\" Belden: Exactly 11 months older than Trixie, 14-year-old Martin Belden is often described as Trixie's 'almost-twin'. Mart is best known for both his appetite and his outsized vocabulary. He has a crush on Diana Lynch. He has a fondness for Cosmo McNaught space adventures books and in The Mystery of the Ghostly Galleon, bickers with Trixie that Cosmo is better than Lucy from the Lucy Radcliff books Trixie likes so much. He plans to become a farmer, although The Pet Show Mystery gave him an interest in computers. Despite his frequent arguments with his sister (they are constantly teasing and picking on each other), the two are quite close. *Diana \\"Di\\" Lynch: The prettiest girl in class, 13-year-old Diana Lynch has black hair and violet eyes (possibly due to the popularity of Elizabeth Taylor as a young actress at the time Diana's character was created.) She has pairs of twin brothers and twin sisters who are much younger than herself. Her father recently made a lot of money, and Di hates being rich, though the Bob-Whites help her adjust. She joins the Bob-Whites in The Mysterious Visitor, inadvertently providing them with another mystery. She shows great artistic ability in later books and can be a bit gullible at times. She is not the most intelligent, but is a good sport, smiling and laughing often, especially at herself when she makes mistakes. One consistent character trait established over the many stories is Di's love of the color purple. *Daniel \\"Dan\\" Mangan: Orphaned in New York City, Dan Mangan, left to his own devices, became mixed up in a street gang called the Cowhands. Juvenile court sends him to live with his uncle Regan, the Wheelers' groom, in Sleepyside, although he actually lives with and works for Mr. Maypenny, the gamekeeper. After a rough start in Sleepyside, Dan reforms and becomes the seventh Bob-White in The Black Jacket Mystery. His age is unknown; he begins school in Mart's homeroom, but later must study during vacations to keep up with classes he takes with Brian and Jim. He intends to be a police officer in New York City. ==Supporting characters== *Helen Belden (Moms): Trixie's mother, a kind, sensible homemaker. She loves her children and keeps them honest. *Peter Belden (Dad): Trixie's father, a smart, honest, generous man. He works at the Sleepyside bank, and loves his family very much. *Robert \\"Bobby\\" Belden: The youngest Belden is only six when the series starts. Trixie babysits Bobby for her allowance, so she often has to check in on him and read him stories when she would much rather be solving a mystery. *Reddy: The Belden's Irish Setter. He is affectionate, but resists all attempts to train him. *Miss Trask: She worked as a math teacher at Honey's old boarding school, but Honey liked her so much Mr. Wheeler hired her to be Honey's governess. Now she mostly manages the estate. She is smart, sensible, and efficient; the Bob- Whites love Miss Trask, and she loves them. Miss Trask often accompanies the kids when they travel. *Bill Regan: The hot-headed but good-natured groom. In the first book, he teaches Trixie to ride horses, and has been well loved by all the Bob-Whites since. Twenty-two in the first book, Regan is a good friend to the Bob-Whites, always helping out when they need him. He seems to have a love interest in The Mystery at Saratoga. He takes in his late sister's son, Dan Mangan, and brings him from New York City to live in Sleepyside with Mr. Maypenny, as Mr. Maypenny's helper. *Sgt. Molinson: The local police sergeant is often summoned to the scene of the crime or to warn Trixie against pursuing the mystery. He is not fond of the Bob-Whites' frequent interference in police business, and not shy about telling them so. *Mr. Lytell: The shopkeeper of the local market. He is very curious about the goings-on in the neighborhood (often portrayed as nosy), but sometimes looks the other way as he is fond of Miss Trask. ==Recurring characters== *Spider Webster: A local cop who is more welcoming of the Bob-Whites than is Sgt. Molinson. *Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler: Honey's parents, and later Jim's adoptive parents. They are often away on business, leaving Miss Trask to look after Honey and Jim. *Celia: The Wheelers' maid. *Tom Delanoy: The Wheelers' chauffeur, later married to Celia. *Mr. Maypenny: The gamekeeper on the Wheeler estate. A recluse, he lives on a pie-shaped piece of property in the middle of the game preserve. *Mrs. Vanderpoel: A kind woman who lives nearby and knows nearly everyone in the area, plus much of the local history. *Jonesy: Jim's abusive stepfather. *Ben Riker: Honey's fun-loving cousin. His pranks — like switching the salt and sugar on the dinner table — sometimes rub others the wrong way. *Uncle Andrew: Peter Belden's brother. He owns a sheep ranch in Iowa and a mountain cabin in the Ozarks. He has no children of his own, but he's fond of the Bob-Whites and invites them to stay with him when he can. *Ned Schulz: Son of Uncle Andrew's neighbor in Iowa. He plays on the local high school basketball team and takes a liking to Trixie during the Bob-Whites' visit to Iowa. *Bob and Barbara Hubbell: Twins from near Uncle Andrew's sheep ranch in Iowa, close friends of Ned Schulz. They play and sing folk songs together, including some that they wrote. *Hallie: Trixie's cousin from Idaho. They do not always get along. *Nick Roberts: A fellow student, he is very artistic, particularly sketching and painting. His father runs a local trophy shop in town. *Harrison: The Lynches' butler. His very proper manner often clashes with Di's desire for a normal life. *Dr. Ferris: The local physician, who sometimes makes house calls to the Belden or Wheeler home. ==Series== ==References== * *Shontz, Lori (June 11, 2003). \\"Waiting for Trixie Belden.\\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, alongside a plebiscite on daylight saving time and liquor. The election was called on April 10, 1952, and held on June 12, 1952. The new legislature met for the first time on February 3, 1953. It was the first BC general election to use a preferential ballot, a short- lived phenomenon in the province. The presence of multi-member districts, such as Victoria City with 3 MLAs, in conjunction with the alternative voting system called for an innovation where the district's candidates were split into three \\"ballots\\", each with one candidate from each party.\\"1871-1986 Electoral History of BC\\", p. 231-2 The government until not long before the election had been a Liberal / Progressive Conservative coalition (the Conservatives had recently changed their name to match that of their federal cousins). After the coalition had collapsed, the Liberals felt threatened by the rising popularity of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. To lock out the CCF, the government adopted the alternative voting system instead of leaving the existing system in place or switching to STV. While they ran candidates separately under their own names, Liberal and Conservative party leaders believed that if Liberal voters picked the local Tory candidate as their second preference and vice versa, one of the candidates of the two parties would have enough votes to be elected in many districts, hopefully ensuring the coalition's retention of power. However, the Liberal and PC leaders had not reckoned on being so unpopular with the province's voters. The combined Liberal and PC vote total was 120,000 fewer votes than in the previous election, while the Social Credit party received almost 200,000 more votes than in 1949. The combined Liberal and Conservative vote totals surpassed 50 percent in only eight seat contests, so even if the party voters had adhered to coalition discipline, the coalition did not have enough votes to be elected in most of the districts. They received only a comparative few votes through vote transfers from CCF and SC candidates, whose supporters aided each other where possible.\\"1871-1986 Electoral History of BC\\" In districts where CCF candidates were eliminated, back-up preferences were marked overwhelmingly for the British Columbia Social Credit League (BCSCL). Combined with many second-preference votes transferred from eliminated Liberal and Conservative candidates, this gave the Social Credit party five seats in addition to the 14 seats where its candidates had a plurality in the first counts. In the end, the Social Credit party captured 19 seats. The CCF received 18 seats, helped in many cases by transfers from eliminated SC candidates. The coalition was decimated, winning only 10 seats between both parties. Both Premier Byron \\"Boss\\" Johnson and Tory leader Herbert Anscomb lost their seats. Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. The party had no official leader. Alberta Social Credit Member of Parliament Ernest George Hansell had led the party during the election campaign without contesting a seat himself. The Socreds persuaded Tom Uphill, a Labour member of the Legislature (MLA), to support the party, and so the Socreds were able to form a minority government. (Otherwise, having to provide the Speaker meant that the SC seat total would have been reduced to only the same as the CCF's seat count.) The party's next task was to choose the province's new premier. In a vote of the newly elected caucus, W.A.C. Bennett, a former Conservative MLA who joined the Socreds after losing a bid for the Tory leadership, won a caucus vote and became premier-elect on July 15, 1952. This began what would be 21 years straight – and 36 of the next 39 years – of Social Credit rule in British Columbia. This would also be the last election to produce a minority government until 2017. In hopes of getting a stronger mandate, Bennett deliberately lost a confidence vote in 1953.

The cause of the explosion, although never fully determined, was likely ignition of methane gas which had built up after leaking from an adjacent unventilated mine.Allen Coggins, Fraterville Mine Disaster. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 5 May 2009.Coal Creek Watershed Foundation, Coal Creek: War and Disasters. 2000-2009. Retrieved: 5 May 2009. Shortly after the disaster, the bodies of 89 of the 216 miners killed in the explosion were buried in what became known as the Fraterville Miners' Circle at Leach Cemetery in the nearby town of Coal Creek (modern Rocky Top). In 2005, this circle was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==Location== The Fraterville Mine was one of several mines located in the coal-rich Cumberland Mountains of western Anderson County, Tennessee. The mine and its namesake community were situated near the heart of the Coal Creek Valley, a narrow north-south oriented valley slicing between Walden Ridge to the east and Vowell Mountain to the west. Tennessee State Route 116 connects Fraterville with Briceville to the south and Rocky Top to the north. This stretch of Route 116 has been renamed \\"Fraterville Miners Memorial Highway\\" in honor of the victims of the mine explosion. ==Explosion and recovery efforts== The Coal Creek Coal Company, organized by Knoxville businessman E.C. Camp, began work at the Fraterville Mine in 1870. Coal Creek Coal developed a reputation for fair contracts and fair pay, and the company's Fraterville Mine was considered one of the safest in the region. The company never took part in the state's controversial convict leasing system and paid in cash (rather than scrip), and thus avoided much of the labor unrest that plagued neighboring mines during the Coal Creek War in the early 1890s. According to the Tennessee Commissioner of Labor, the Fraterville Mine explosion occurred around 7:20 on the morning of May 19, 1902. The explosion shot black smoke and debris out the mine's mouth and ventilation shaft. Rescue efforts were organized by the mine's superintendent, George Camp (E.C. Camp's son), and a Welsh mine operator from nearby Jellico named Philip Francis. The initial rescue party penetrated to just , however, before they were forced to turn back and await the dispersal of toxic gases. A second rescue party entered the mine at 4:00 that afternoon, and using a makeshift venting system made of cloth and creosote, they inched their way into the main shaft, where they observed the destruction, later reported by the Commissioner: > Battrices had been destroyed, and along the main entry the force of the > explosion was terrific, timbers and cogs placed to hold a squeeze were blown > out, mine cars, wheels, and doors were shattered, and bodies were > dismembered. Most of the miners were killed by the initial impact of the explosion, although 26 had managed to barricade themselves in a side passage. At least 10 were still alive seven hours after the explosion, but eventually succumbed to toxic air and lack of oxygen. Several miners wrote farewell messages to loved ones shortly before dying, stating they were struggling for air, and encouraging their families to \\"live right\\" so they would meet again in heaven. The last body was removed from the mine four days after the explosion. ==Aftermath== The cause of the explosion was a matter of controversy. The report issued by the Tennessee Commissioner of Labor stated that the explosion occurred when volatile gases that \\"had accumulated because of inadequate ventilation\\" were ignited by an open light. While the report stated that the shutdown of the mine's ventilation system over the previous weekend had allowed the dangerous build-up of the gases, ventilation furnace operator Tip Hightower was acquitted of negligence at a subsequent inquest. The report also suggested that gases had leaked into the Fraterville Mine from an adjacent abandoned (and unventilated) mine once operated by the Knoxville Iron Company. Along with Hightower, superintendent George Camp was also charged with negligence, but was acquitted after several hours of tearful testimony. The community of Fraterville was devastated by the mine explosion. The town lost all but three of its adult males. Hundreds of women were widowed, and roughly a thousand children were left fatherless. Some families lost as many as eight family members. A large memorial service was conducted at the Briceville Community Church on June 8, 1902.Amanda Post and Emily Robinson, National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Briceville Community Church and Cemetery, October 2002. Eighty-nine of the deceased miners are buried in the Fraterville Miners' Circle in Leach Cemetery (behind Clear Branch Baptist Church) just off U.S. 25W at Rocky Top. A monument at the center of the circle bears the names of all 184 miners who were identified. On May 19, 2005, the circle was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Other miners who lost their lives in the Fraterville disaster are buried in Longfield Cemetery on U.S. Route 441 just east of Rocky Top. ==See also== *Cross Mountain Mine disaster ==References== ==External links== *Coal Creek Watershed Foundation *Fraterville Mine Explosion - Tennessee State Library *Carl Fritts website on the disaster *List of miners who lost their lives *Final letters from victims *Coal Creek, TN Fraterville Mine Disaster, May 1902 at GenDisasters.com Category:Anderson County, Tennessee Category:Coal mining disasters in Tennessee Category:1902 mining disasters Category:1902 in Tennessee Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anderson County, Tennessee Category:1902 disasters in the United States Category:May 1902 events ","title":"Fraterville Mine disaster"},{"id":"1423961","text":"Oinountas () is a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece.

He merited the title of Chozeh, which means seer or visionary ...\\" A leading figure in the early Hasidic movement, he became known as the \\"seer\\" or \\"visionary\\" due to his purported ability to gaze across great distance by supernatural means. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch. He continued his studies under Shmelke of Nilkolsburg and Elimelech of Lizhensk. He lived for a while in Lantzut before moving to Lublin. After Horowitz moved to Lublin, thousands of Hasidim flocked to learn from him. Among his disciples were such Hasidic luminaries as Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (\\"the Holy Jew\\"), Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, Meir of Apta, David of Lelov, Moshe Teitelbaum, Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov, Naftali Zvi of Ropshitz, and Shalom Rokeach of Belz. Horowitz also gained a reputation as a miracle-worker who could accomplish the tikkun, or repair of the soul, of those who sought his assistance and guidance. During his stay in Lublin, Horowitz was opposed by a prominent mitnaged rabbi, Azriel Horowitz. Horowitz was a descendant of Isaiah Horowitz, a prominent rabbi and mystic, and his maternal grandfather, Yaakov Koppel Likover, also a prominent rabbi and scholar, as well as a contemporary of the Ba'al Shem Tov. He was injured in a fall from a window on Simchat Torah night, following the ritual hakafos dancing, and died almost a year later on Tisha B'av'Codex Judaica' M.Kantor, p.261 from injuries relating to this fall.

The book's narrative is split into two styles: a conventional first-person account of the past and a more surreal, stream-of-consciousness account of an otherworldly present. Like many of Welsh's novels, it is written in Edinburgh Scots dialect. The plot consists of the memories and hallucinations of the protagonist, Roy Strang, making him an extreme example of an unreliable narrator. ==Plot summary== Roy Strang narrates the book from an (at first) unexplained coma, which he has been in for the previous two years. His life in this state is a miserable affair, surrounded by uncaring doctors and his extremely dysfunctional family. In his fantasy life, he is an adventurer in the wilds of South Africa, where he and his loyal guide, Sandy Jamieson, hunt for the marabou stork. When not hallucinating, Strang tells his life story, beginning in a \\"scheme\\" (local authority housing) in Muirhouse, Scotland, with his violent, delusional parents, two half-brothers (one a womanizer, the other flamboyantly gay), and his promiscuous sister, all of whom he despises. When Strang is 12, he and his family relocate to apartheid-era South Africa, where he is repeatedly molested by his uncle. After his father is jailed for the violent assault of a taxi driver and his uncle is killed in a terrorist bombing, the Strangs are forced to return to Scotland, a mere 18 months after they left. Strang grows into a violent, misogynistic thug. He maintains a full-time job as a systems analyst for the fictional investment group, \\"Scottish Spinsters\\" (a reference to Scottish Widows). He joins a gang of football hooligans who are attached to Hibernian F.C., the Capital City Service, and led by the fearsome Lexo. Strang enjoys his life as a \\"top boy,\\" feared by the entire town, until the gang kidnaps a young woman who rejected their advances and gang rapes her; Strang is horrified, but too intimidated to try to stop them. The gang evades prison, but Strang is stricken with guilt and withdraws completely into depression. He briefly revives a few months later when he meets a woman and genuinely feels love for the first time. Around the same time he begins to take ecstasy, and befriends his gay half-brother. His happiness is short-lived, however; the memory of what he has done continues to haunt him, and his depression soon completely engulfs him, taking him away from his lover and his drug-driven escapism. He attempts suicide by asphyxiation, but survives, putting him in a coma. One day, the gang's rape victim visits him in the hospital. She tells him that she has been murdering her rapists one by one, and now she has come for him, revealing that he was by far the most brutal. She then cuts off his penis and stabs him to death. In his final moments, Strang realizes that the only person he has ever really hated is himself, and makes peace with everyone he has wronged and who has wronged him. The novel's other, more stream-of- consciousness narrative, intertwined with the story of Strang's past, takes place in the fantasy world he creates for himself in the coma. At first a bizarre but rousing adventure, it gradually becomes darker as Strang reveals the uglier parts of his life and personality, involving surreal images of brutality and sexual violence. ==Reception== Boyd Tonkin at The Observer praises Welsh for the power of his fiction and writes: \\"Here was a voice, out of Edinburgh by way of Hades, that would never have a problem with energy, wit or compassion. Finding the right form for all this incendiary talent might prove trickier.\\" Tonkin suggests that Welsh does not know what to do with his fatalism, but that the story \\"gives a shockingly funny shape to that impasse\\". ==Analysis== As in many of Welsh's novels, there are many allusions to music and underground youth culture, especially rave culture, punk rock, comic books, and football hooliganism. There is a strong message against violence towards women from men in the book; one passage is in fact set out in a capital \\"Z\\", which is the symbol for Zero Tolerance, a women's rights group based in Scotland. The South African narrative is written in a Boys' Own style. The sociopathic Francis Begbie, one of the main characters in Trainspotting, makes a cameo appearance. ==References== ==External links== Category:1995 British novels Category:Novels by Irvine Welsh Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators Category:Novels set in Edinburgh Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Gang rape in fiction ","title":"Marabou Stork Nightmares"},{"id":"1423978","text":" MV Abegweit was an icebreaking railway, vehicle, and passenger ferry which operated across the Abegweit Passage of Northumberland Strait, connecting Port Borden to Cape Tormentine between 1947 and 1982. The word Abegweit is derived from the Mi'kmaq word for Prince Edward Island, Epekwit'k, meaning \\"cradled (or cradle) on the waves.\\" ==Design and construction== Abegweit crossing the Northumberland Strait in her glory days. The first Abegweit was laid down as hull 144 in November 1944 and was launched in 1946 at the Marine Industries Limited shipyard in Sorel, Quebec. Her designers were the famous Montreal design firm of German & Milne. Her owners were Canadian National Railways (CNR), operator of the Borden–Cape Tormentine service from 1918 to 1977. This vessel was the most powerful icebreaker in the world at the time of her commissioning on June 28, 1947, and was reportedly the heaviest vessel ever constructed in Canada as well. Her patron at the time of commissioning was Mrs. J. Walter Jones, wife of the premier of Prince Edward Island. She entered service on August 14, 1947 and earned the hearts of Islanders who affectionately called her the \\"Abby\\". She measured 372 feet in length and displaced 7,000 tons. Her eight main engines generated 13,500 brake horsepower (10 MW) and drove propellers at both bow and stern. She could carry 950 passengers and 60 cars (or one complete passenger train of 16 railway cars). ==Service== The growth of vehicle and rail traffic by the 1950s soon made her obsolete, and subsequent vessels introduced in the 1960s and 1970s could carry more vehicles and rail traffic and could load and unload with greater speed. ==Disposal and sale== The replacement for Abegweit was a vessel that was laid down as MV Straitway; however, while under construction CN Marine decided to name this new vessel Abegweit. To accommodate this change, the original Abegweit was renamed Abby in fall 1982 and she maintained this name through the end of her ferry service. After finishing service on the Borden–Cape Tormentine route, the Abby was moved to Pictou, Nova Scotia and placed for sale during the winter of 1982–1983. During the winter of 1982–1983, while the new Abegweit was in service between Borden and Cape Tormentine, the old Abby was docked at Pictou, Nova Scotia and advertised for sale by CN Marine. She was purchased by the Columbia Yacht Club in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago city ordinances barred the club from constructing a clubhouse on the waterfront, so the club decided to purchase the Abby and permanently moor her at their facility. Abby left the Northumberland Strait for good in April, 1983 and remains in \\"service\\" in Chicago. A curious phenomenon arising out of CN Marine's name-switch operation is that many in the general public assume the new vessel's name was Abegweit II — this is not the case as she was officially registered as Abegweit. ==Columbia Yacht Club== Abegweit was purchased by the Columbia Yacht Club in 1983 and moved to Chicago that spring. In 1986, she appeared in an action sequence in the film, Running Scared. She continues to serve as club house for the CYC. The ship had new hull paint applied in 2010, preserving the traditional color scheme. ==See also== * CN Marine * MV Abegweit (1982) ==External links== * Columbia Yacht Club * The Island Register.com - P.E.I.'s Coastal Vessels and Ferries Category:Ferries of Prince Edward Island Category:Ferries of New Brunswick Category:Icebreakers of Canada Category:CN Marine Category:Ships built in Quebec Category:1946 ships Category:Transport in Prince County, Prince Edward Island ","title":"MV Abegweit (1947)"},{"id":"1423985","text":"The Solothurner Literaturpreis is a literary award for a 'literary achievement by a German language writer.

Consequently, Hinchliffe's votes are included in the Conservative Party total and Bayne, who ran as an \\"Official Conservative\\", is listed separately. ==Results by riding== -  align=\\"center\\" James Mowat align=\\"center\\" Alberni Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Burnaby CCF align=\\"center\\" Ernest Edward Winch  -  align=\\"center\\" William James Asselstine align=\\"center\\" Atlin Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Comox CCF align=\\"center\\" Colin Cameron  -  align=\\"center\\" Louis LeBourdais align=\\"center\\" Cariboo Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Cowichan-Newcastle CCF align=\\"center\\" Samuel Guthrie  -  align=\\"center\\" Thomas King align=\\"center\\" Columbia Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Delta CCF align=\\"center\\" Leonard Alec Shepherd  -  align=\\"center\\" Henry George Thomas Perry align=\\"center\\" Fort George Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Mackenzie CCF align=\\"center\\" Herbert Gargrave  -  align=\\"center\\" Robert Henry Carson align=\\"center\\" Kamloops Liberal   align=\\"center\\" North Vancouver CCF align=\\"center\\" Dorothy Steeves  -  align=\\"center\\" Charles Sidney Leary align=\\"center\\" Kaslo-Slocan Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Rossland-Trail CCF align=\\"center\\" Herbert Wilfred Herridge  -  align=\\"center\\" George Sharratt Pearson align=\\"center\\" Nanaimo and the Islands Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Similkameen CCF align=\\"center\\" Bernard George Webber  -  align=\\"center\\" Frank Putnam align=\\"center\\" Nelson-Creston Liberal   align=\\"center\\" rowspan=2 Vancouver-Burrard CCF align=\\"center\\" Winona Grace MacInnis  -  align=\\"center\\" Arthur Wellesley Gray align=\\"center\\" New Westminster Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Charles Grant MacNeil  -  align=\\"center\\" Kenneth Cattanach MacDonald align=\\"center\\" North Okanagan Liberal   align=\\"center\\" rowspan=2 Vancouver Centre CCF align=\\"center\\" Laura Emma Marshall Jamieson  -  align=\\"center\\" Mark Matthew Connelly align=\\"center\\" Omineca Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Wallis Walter LeFeaux  -  align=\\"center\\" Glen Everton Braden align=\\"center\\" Peace River Liberal   align=\\"center\\" rowspan=2 Vancouver East CCF align=\\"center\\" James Lyle Telford  -  align=\\"center\\" Thomas Dufferin Pattullo align=\\"center\\" Prince Rupert Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Harold Edward Winch2  -  align=\\"center\\" Harry Johnston align=\\"center\\" Revelstoke Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Chilliwack align=\\"center\\" Leslie Harvey Eyres  -  align=\\"center\\" Norman William Whittaker align=\\"center\\" Saanich Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Cranbrook Conservative align=\\"center\\" Frank William Green  -  align=\\"center\\" Edward Tourtellotte Kenney align=\\"center\\" Skeena Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Dewdney Conservative align=\\"center\\" Roderick Charles MacDonald  -  align=\\"center\\" John Hart 1 align=\\"center\\" rowspan=3 Victoria City Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Esquimalt Conservative align=\\"center\\" Elmer Victor Finland  -  align=\\"center\\" Nancy Hodges   align=\\"center\\" Grand Forks- Greenwood Conservative align=\\"center\\" Thomas Alfred Love  -  align=\\"center\\" William Thomas Straith   align=\\"center\\" Lillooet Conservative align=\\"center\\" Ernest Crawford Carson  -  align=\\"center\\" John Joseph Alban Gillis align=\\"center\\" Yale Liberal   align=\\"center\\" Oak Bay Conservative align=\\"center\\" Herbert Anscomb  -  align=\\"center\\" Thomas Aubert Uphill align=\\"center\\" Fernie Labour (Party)   align=\\"center\\" South Okanagan Conservative align=\\"center\\" William Andrew Cecil Bennett  -  align=\\"center\\" Rolf Wallgren Bruhn align=\\"center\\" Salmon Arm Independent   align=\\"center\\" rowspan=3 Vancouver-Point Grey Conservative align=\\"center\\" Royal Lethington Maitland  -      align=\\"center\\" James Alexander Paton  -      align=\\"center\\" Tilly Rolston  -  align=\\"center\\"1 Premier-Elect and Incumbent    align=\\"center\\"2 Leader of the Opposition   - } Sources: 1\\\\.

O'Reilly, \\"The Theban Legion of St. Maurice\\" Vigiliae Christianae 32.3 (September 1978), pp. 195–207, reveal its continued vitality as an element of Christian legend rather than Christian mythology. as an entire Roman legion -- of \\"six thousand six hundred and sixty-six men\\"6666 is not the normal number of soldiers in a Roman Legion, and its appearance in this context is interesting for its similarity to 666, which has a diametically opposite association as the well-known Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation. -- who had converted en masse to Christianity and were martyred together, in 286, according to the hagiographies of Saint Maurice, the chief among the Legion's saints. Their feast day is held on September 22. ==The account== According to Eucherius of Lyon,Codex Parisiensis, Bibliothèque nationale, 9550, reproduced in Louis Dupraz, Les passions de st Maurice d'Agaune: Essai sur l'historicité de la tradition et contribution à l'étude de l'armée pré- Dioclétienne (260–286) et des canonisations tardives de la fin du IVe siècle (Fribourg 1961), Appendix I. Dupraz writes to confirm the historicity of the Theban Legion. ca. 443–450, the Legion was the garrison of the city of Thebes in Egypt. The Legion were quartered in the East until the emperor Maximian ordered them to march to Gaul, to assist him against the rebels of Burgundy. The Theban Legion\\"legio militum, qui Thebaei appellabantur\\" in Eucherius' letter. was commanded in its march by Saint Maurice (Mauritius), Candidus, Innocent, and Exuperius, all of whom are venerated as saints. At Saint- Maurice, Switzerland, then called Agaunum, the orders were given-- since the Legion had refused to sacrifice to the Emperor-- to \\"decimate\\" it by putting to death a tenth of its men. This act was repeated twice before the entire legion was put to death.https://catholicsaints.info/martyrs-of-the-theban- legion/http://www.bibleprobe.com/theban.html Statue of Saint Maurice; leader of the Theban Legion. According to a letter written about 450 by Eucherius, Bishop of Lyon, bodies identified as the martyrs of Agaunum were discovered by Theodore (Theodulus), the first historically identified Bishop of Octudurum, who was present at the Council of Aquileia, 381 and died in 391. The basilica he built in their honor attracted the pilgrim trade; its remains can still be seen, part of the abbey begun in the early sixth century on land donated by King Sigismund of Burgundy. Coptic icon of Theban Legion The earliest surviving document describing \\"the holy Martyrs who have made Agaunum illustrious with their blood\\" is the letter of Eucherius, which describes the succession of witnesses from the martyrdom to his time, a span of about 150 years. The bishop had made the journey to Agaunum himself, and his report of his visit multiplied a thousandfold the standard formula of the martyrologies: > We often hear, do we not, a particular locality or city is held in high > honour because of one single martyr who died there, and quite rightly, > because in each case the saint gave his precious soul to the most high God. > How much more should this sacred place, Agaunum, be reverenced, where so > many thousands of martyrs have been slain, with the sword, for the sake of > Christ. As with many hagiographies, Eucherius' letter to Bishop Salvius reinforced an existing pilgrimage site. Many of the faithful were coming from diverse provinces of the empire, according to Eucherius, devoutly to honor these saints, and (important for the abbey of Agaunum) to offer presents of gold, silver and other things. He mentions many miracles, such as casting out of devils and other kinds of healing \\"which the power of the Lord works there every day through the intercession of his saints.\\" In the late sixth century, Gregory of Tours was convinced of the miraculous powers of the Theban Legion, though he transferred the event to Cologne, where there was an early cult devoted to Maurice and the Theban Legion: > At Cologne there is a church in which the fifty men from the holy Theban > Legion are said to have consummated their martyrdom for the name of Christ. > And because the church, with its wonderful construction and mosaics, shines > as if somehow gilded, the inhabitants prefer to call it the \\"Church of the > Golden Saints\\". Once Eberigisilus, who was at the time bishop of Cologne, > was racked with severe pains in half his head. He was then in a villa near a > village. Eberigisilus sent his deacon to the church of the saints. Since > there was said to be in the middle of the church a pit into which the saints > were thrown together after their martyrdom, the deacon collected some dust > there and brought it to the bishop. As soon as the dust touched > Eberigisilus' head, immediately all pain was gone.Van Dam, R. ed., Gregory > of Tours: Glory of the Martyrs, Liverpool, 1988, ch. 85. The tale of steadfast conduct and faith was embroidered in later retellings and figured in the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine and was included among the persecution of Christians detailed in John Foxe's 1583 Actes and Monuments, an early Protestant stand-by.John Malham, T. Pratt, Fox's Book of Martyrs: Or, The Acts and Monuments of the Christian Church; Being a Complete History of the Lives, Sufferings, and Deaths of the Christian Martyrs; from the Commencement of Christianity to the Present Period (W. Borradaile, 1829).p420. Accounts of the moral inculcated by the exemplum of the Theban Legion resonate with the immediate culture of each teller. The miraculous whole-hearted unanimity of the Legion to the last individual, was downplayed by Hugo Grotius, for whom the moral of the Theban Legion was employed to condemn atrocities committed under military orders.Grotius, De jure belli I.2.14–16, noted by O'Reilly 1978:195. For Donald O'Reilly, an apologist for the historicity of the account in 1978, it was \\"the moral issue of organized violence\\".O'Reilly 1978. ==Interpretations== Thebaei is the proper name of one particular military unit, the Legio I Maximiana, also known as Maximiana Thebaeorum, recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum.Notitia Dignitatum, VII. According to Samir F. Girgis, writing in the Coptic Encyclopedia, there were two legions bearing the name \\"Theban,\\" both of them formed by Diocletian sometime after the organization of the original Egyptian legion, stationed at Alexandria. It is not certain which of these was transferred from Egypt to Europe in order to assist Maximian in Gaul. The monastic accounts themselves do not specifically state that all the soldiers were collectively executed; an eleventh-century monk named Otto of Freising wrote that most of the legionaries escaped, and only some were executed.Donald F. O'Reilly. The Theban Legion of St. Maurice. Vigiliae Christianae. Vol. 32, No. 3, Sep., 1978. It is possible that the legion was simply divided during Diocletian's re-organization of units (breaking up legions of 6000 men to create smaller units of 1000), and that some of the soldiers had been executed, and that this was where the story of the legion's destruction originated from. Henri Leclercq suggests that it is quite possible that an incident at Agaunum may have had to do not with a legion, but with a simple detachment.Leclercq, Henri. \\"Agaunum.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 6 Mar. 2013 Johan Mösch, after comparing information from the various chronicles on the events and geography of the martyrdoms of the legionaries, concluded that only a single cohort was martyred at Agaunum. The remainder of the cohorts (battalion sized units of which there were ten to a legion) were either on the march or already stationed along the Roman road that ran from Liguria through Turin and Milan, then across Alps and down the Rhine to Colonia Agrippinensis (Cologne). L. Dupraz and Paul Müller, by examining the military titles and ranks of the legionnaires and thereby determining the total number of soldiers involved, estimated that the Thebans martyred at Agaunum consisted of but one cohort whose number did not exceed 520 men. Thus the execution of an entire cohors is equivalent to decimation of a legion. ==Historicity== Denis Van Berchem, of the University of Geneva, proposed that Eucherius' presentation of the legend of the Theban legion was a literary production, not based on a local tradition.Van Berchem, Denis, The Martyrdom of the Theban Legion, Basel, 1956. David Woods, Professor of Classics at the University College Cork, alleges that the model of Maurice and the Theban Legion based on Eucherius of Lyon's letter was a complete fiction.Woods, David, \\"The Origin of the Legend of Maurice and the Theban Legion\\", Journal of Ecclesiastical History 45 (1994), pp. 385–95. The strength of the account is based on the historical reputation for the first monks in the Christian tradition, the hermits of the Egyptian desert known as the \\"Desert Fathers\\", and the almost fanatical Christian following they inspired during the first two centuries. The most famous of the Desert Fathers was Anthony the Great. The persecution of high-ranking Christian nobility under Emperor Valerian following his edict in 258 and the purge of Christians from the military from 284 through 299 under Emperor Diocletian indicate that noncompliance with emperor worship was the common method for detecting Christian soldiers and eventually executing them. Donald F. O'Reilly argues that evidence from coins, papyrus, and Roman army lists supports the story of the Theban Legion. A papyrus dated \\"in the sixth year of our Lord the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Probus Pius Augustus, Tubi sixteenth\\" (13 January 282 AD), shows rations which would sustain a legion for about three months to be delivered to Panopolis to the \\"mobilized soldiers and sailors\\". Coins from Alexandria from the same time period were minted in a style used only when troops for a new legion were leaving port. During the trial of the martyr Maximilian, it was noted that there were Christians serving in the Roman army, and the existence of Theban Christian legionnaires in the same units as mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum was shown.Donald F. O'Reilly. The Theban Legion of St. Maurice. Vigiliae Christianae. Vol. 32, No. 3, Sep., 1978. Henri Leclercq also notes that the account of Eucherius \\"has many excellent qualities, historical as well as literary.\\"Leclercq, Henri. \\"Agaunum.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 6 Mar. 2013 L. Dupaz countered Denis Van Berchem's assertion by sifting through the stories, carefully matching them with archeological discoveries at Agaunum, thus concluding that the martyrdom is historical and that the relics of the martyrs were brought to Agaunum between 286 and 392 through the office of the bishop Theodore.David Bindman, Henry Louis Gates, Karen C. C. Dalton, The Image of the Black in Western Art Pt. II (Italy 1979: Menil Foundation), 139. Dom Ruinart, Paul Allard, and the editors of the \\"Analecta Bollandiana\\" are of opinion that \\"the martyrdom of the legion, attested, as it is by ancient and reliable evidence, cannot be called in question by any honest mind.\\"cited in http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01205a.htm ==Saints associated with the Theban legion== ==Gallery== File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 011.jpgSaint Maurice File:BnF Anne 177v.jpgIllustration from the Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany (1503–08) Image:Thebaei shield pattern.svgThebaei shield pattern, redrawn from a medieval manuscript of Notitia Dignitatum File:Alexander-of- Bergamo-San Alessandro.jpgAlexander of Bergamo File:Oberbreisig St. Viktor hl.

The new legislature met for the first time on October 26, 1937. The governing Liberal Party, despite winning only 37% of the popular vote, benefited from the split in the vote between the Conservative Party and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and won a solid majority of the seats in the legislature. The rift in the Conservative Party that led to its decision not to nominate candidates in the 1933 election had been resolved, and the party was able to form the official opposition. The Conservatives and CCF each won about 29% of the vote, and only 8 seats and 7 seats, respectively. The remaining two seats were won by Labour and Independent candidates. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" -

The SSB's mission was to provide an intelligence capability for field operation units, and U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF), in support of anti- terrorism and counter-terrorism missions in war zones and beyond. The SSB has been dissolved with many of its activities and capabilities transferred to DIA's Defense Clandestine Service. ==Overview== Originally titled Human Augmentation Teams, the Strategic Support Branch was established to give DoD an increase of human intelligence capabilities and what was considered by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld an end to \\"near total dependence on the CIA\\" for human intelligence. Although the SSB was designed to operate without detection and under the defense secretary's direct control, it is commanded by high-ranking military officials. Strategic Support teams have about 10 members each, consisting of case officers, linguists, interrogators and other specialists from the Defense Human Intelligence Service, a branch of the DIA. The missions they undertake are secret, but members do not use covert methods like false identities or nationalities. The unit operated secretly in Iraq, Afghanistan and several classified locations for two years. The SSB works directly with United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to add missing capabilities such as the skill to establish local spy networks and the technology for direct access to national intelligence databases to USSOCOM's special operations units, specifically the special missions units of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Also USSOCOM previously had to receive permission from the CIA to conduct clandestine operations in certain countries, but that was no longer necessary after the establishment of the SSB. DoD has decided that it will coordinate its human intelligence missions with the CIA but will not, as in the past, await consent. ===Controversy=== The Strategic Support Branch was financed using \\"reprogrammed\\" funds, without explicit authority or appropriation of the United States Congress. The Pentagon hadn't released any details of the unit's operations or even of its existence to Congress until after an article about the secret unit was released by The Washington Post. Pentagon officials emphasized their intention to remain accountable to Congress, but they also asserted that Defense intelligence missions are subject to fewer legal constraints than believed. That assertion involves new interpretations of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which governs the armed services, and Title 50, which governs, among other things, foreign intelligence. Under Title 10, for example, the Defense Department must report to Congress all \\"deployment orders\\", or formal instructions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to position U.S. forces for combat. But guidelines issued by former Undersecretary for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone state that special operations forces may \\"conduct clandestine HUMINT operations... before publication\\" of a deployment order, rendering notification unnecessary. Pentagon lawyers also define the \\"War on Terror\\" as ongoing, indefinite, and global in scope. That analysis effectively discards the limitation of the defense secretary's war powers to times and places of imminent combat. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Alt URL * * Category:Defense Intelligence Agency Category:United States Department of Defense agencies Category:United States intelligence agencies Category:Defunct United States intelligence agencies ","title":"Strategic Support Branch"},{"id":"1424022","text":"Svatopluk Turek (October 25, 1900 in Hodslavice – December 30, 1972 in Zlín) was a Czech novelist, known under pen name T.

The village is located roughly halfway between Rugby and Coventry, and had a population of 2,564 at the 2011 census. It is close to the A45 road and the Roman road the Fosse Way. The River Avon flows through the village. Near the river are the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, Brandon Castle. A Benedictine priory, Wolston Priory, was sited to the east of the village and its earthwork remains are now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The village has two churches: the parish church of St Margaret's and Wolston Baptist Church. Wolston once had a railway station, Brandon and Wolston railway station on the Rugby- Coventry line, but this was closed in 1960, although one of the platforms can still be seen. Periodic calls are made to re-open the station as the combined population of Wolston and Brandon is almost 3,000. One of the most notable features in the village is the railway viaduct which dates from the 1830s and was part of the original London and Birmingham Railway. The viaduct separates Wolston from the smaller village of Brandon. The two shared a football team \\"Brandon & Wolston Football Club\\".Brandon, Bretford & Wolston History Group: A History of Brandon & Wolston Football Club, page 1, Brandon, Bretford & Wolston History Group They no longer have a senior men's team but they still run a junior club. The village contains a primary school (Wolston St Margarets Primary C of E School). St Margaret's Primary was originally in School Street, but that building is now used as offices. Wolston also used to have a secondary school called Wolston High School, but it was knocked down and replaced with a community centre. Wolston still has a library, and a small selection of shops and pubs. Near to Wolston is the community-owned Brandon Wood. In geology, the village gives its name to the Wolstonian Stage, a British regional subdivision of the Pleistocene Epoch. ==Notable people== *William Rose (1842–1917), cricketer ==References== ==External links== *Railways of Warwickshire website Category:Villages in Warwickshire ","title":"Wolston"},{"id":"1424029","text":"Fucus is a genus of brown algae found in the intertidal zones of rocky seashores almost throughout the world. ==Description and life cycle== The thallus is perennial with an irregular or disc-shaped holdfast or with haptera. The erect portion of the thallus is dichotomous or subpinnately branched, flattened and with a distinct midrib. Gas-filled pneumatocysts (air- vesicles) are present in pairs in some species, one on either side of the midrib. The erect portion of the thallus bears cryptostomata and caecostomata (sterile surface cavities). The base of the thallus is stipe-like due to abrasion of the tissue lateral to the midrib and it is attached to the rock by a holdfast. The gametangia develop in conceptacles embedded in receptacles in the apices of the final branches. They may be monoecious or dioecious. These algae have a relatively simple life cycle and produce only one type of thallus which grows to a maximum size of 2 m. Fertile cavities, the conceptacles, containing the reproductive cells are immersed in the receptacles near the ends of the branches. After meiosis oogonia and antheridia, the female and male reproductive organs, produce egg cells and sperm respectively that are released into the sea where fertilisation takes place. The resulting zygote develops directly into the diploid plant. This contrasts with the life cycle of the flowering plant, where the egg cells and sperm are produced by a haploid multicellular generation, albeit very strongly reduced, and the egg cells are fertilised within the ovules of the parent plant and then released as seeds. ==Distribution and ecology== Species of Fucus are recorded almost worldwide. They are dominant on the shores of the British Isles, the northeastern coast of North America and California. In the British Isles these larger brown algae occur on sheltered shores in fairly well defined zones along the shore from high-water mark to below low water mark. On the more exposed shores not all of these species can be found and on very exposed shores few, if any, occur. Pelvetia canaliculata forms a zone at the top of the shore. Just below this Fucus spiralis, Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus and Laminaria form clear zones, one below the other, along the shore down to low water mark. On sheltered shores Ascophyllum nodosum usually forms a broad and dominating zone along the shore at the mid-littoral. Other brown algae can be found at the low-littoral such as Himanthalia, Laminaria saxatilis and Alaria esculenta. Small green and red algae and animals occur, protected under these large brown algae. When washed up on beaches, kelp flies such as Coelopa pilipes feed and breed on Fucus algae. ==Uses== In Scotland and Norway, up until the mid-19th century, several seaweed species from Fucus and other genera were harvested, dried, burned to ash, and further processed to become \\"kelp\\", which was a type of soda ash that was less costly in Britain than the barilla imported from Spain. It has an alkali content of about 2.5%–5% that was mainly sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), used in soapmaking, glassmaking, and other industries. The purest barilla had a sodium carbonate concentration of about 30%. The seaweed was also used as fertilizer for crop land in the same areas in which it was harvested. Fucus species can also be used for thalassotherapy, along with other species such as Turkish towel (Chondracanthus exasperatus), feather boa (Egregia menziesii), and finger kelp (Laminaria digitata). In 2005, it was announced that bacteria grown on Fucus have the ability to attack and kill the MRSA superbacterium. == Predator == Coelopa frigida and other of the Coelopa genus are known to feed, mate, and create habitats out of different species of Fucus. This is of particular notice when the Fucus is stranded on the beach and not when it is submerged under seawater. With increasing amounts of seaweed washing up on shores, there is an increasing recognition of Fucus and their close pairing with Coelopa. == Taxonomy == Two species of Fucus growing next to each other in the intertidal zone, F. serratus in the front, F. vesiculosus in the back Conceptacle of F. vesiculosus, with filaments protruding; Scale bar: 20 μm This list of species of Fucus excludes names of uncertain status: * Fucus atomarius (Woodward) Bertoloni * Fucus ceranoides L. – horned wrack * * Fucus chalonii Feldmann * Fucus cottonii M.

Agardh * Species recorded around the coast of Britain. ===Fucus distichus=== F. distichus is up to 10 cm long with a short stout cylindrical stipe, branching dichotomous, flat and with a mid-rib. F. distichus subsp. edentatus was first described from Shetland by Börgesen in 1903. Powell found F. distichus subsp. anceps on the north coast of Caithness. It had also been recorded from: Orkney, Fair Isle, St Kilda and the Outer Hebrides in Scotland; in Ireland it had been recorded from Counties Clare, Donegal and Kerry. Two subspecies of F. distichus (subsp. anceps and subsp. edentatus) have been described from the British Isles. Fucus distichus is the organism used as a model to study the development of cell polarity, since it forms an apolar zygote that can develop polarity given a varying number of gradients. ===Fucus serratus=== F. serratus, toothed wrack, is the most distinctive of all the Fucus species. It clearly shows a distinctive serrated edge to the frond not shown by the other species of the genus. ===Fucus spiralis=== F. spiralis is one of the three most common algae on the shores of the British Isles. It grows to about 40 cm long and does not show air bladders as found on F.vesiculosus or toothed edges as found on F. serratus. It forms a zone near the top of the shore above the zones of F. vesiculosus and F. serratus. ===Fucus vesiculosus=== This is one of the most common species of Fucus, common on most shores in the mid- littoral. It has the common name \\"bladder wrack\\", and is readily identified by a distinct mid-rib and air vesicles in pairs on either side of the mid-rib. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Fucales Category:Fucales genera ","title":"Fucus"},{"id":"1424036","text":"David Chu may refer to: * David Chu (designer), founder of Nautica, a men's designer outerwear company * David S.

Notably, as of 2019, this remains the final election in British Columbia history where the Conservative Party would achieve power in its own right. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular vote - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"1924 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change Conservative align=\\"center\\"Simon Fraser Tolmie align=\\"right\\"48 align=\\"right\\"17 align=\\"right\\"35 align=\\"right\\" +105.9% align=\\"right\\"192,867 align=\\"right\\" 53.30% align=\\"right\\" +23.85% Liberal align=\\"center\\"John Duncan MacLean align=\\"right\\"45 align=\\"right\\"23 align=\\"right\\"12 align=\\"right\\"-47.8% align=\\"right\\"144,872 align=\\"right\\" 40.04% align=\\"right\\" +8.70% Independent Labour Party align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"9 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"17,908 align=\\"right\\" 4.95% align=\\"right\\" *  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent align=\\"right\\"9 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"3,658 align=\\"right\\" 1.01% align=\\"right\\" +0.28%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Conservative align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"1,064 align=\\"right\\" 0.29% align=\\"right\\"-0.30%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Liberal align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" -100% align=\\"right\\"1,001 align=\\"right\\" 0.28% align=\\"right\\" -0.75%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Labour align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"316 align=\\"right\\" 0.09% align=\\"right\\" *  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Farmer align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"128 align=\\"right\\" 0.04% align=\\"right\\" * - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\"117 !align=\\"right\\"48 !align=\\"right\\"48 !align=\\"right\\" - !align=\\"right\\"361,814 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"10\\"Source: Elections BC - } Note: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. ==Results by riding== -  align=\\"center\\" William Robert Rutledge align=\\"center\\" Burnaby Conservative   align=\\"center\\" Alberni Liberal align=\\"center\\" Laurence Arnold Hanna  -  align=\\"center\\" Roderick MacKenzie align=\\"center\\" Cariboo Conservative   align=\\"center\\" Atlin Liberal align=\\"center\\" Herbert Frederick Kergin  -  align=\\"center\\" William Atkinson align=\\"center\\" Chilliwack Conservative   align=\\"center\\" Columbia Liberal align=\\"center\\" John Andrew Buckham  -  align=\\"center\\" George Kerr McNaughton align=\\"center\\" Comox Conservative   align=\\"center\\" Cranbrook Liberal align=\\"center\\" Frank Mitchell MacPherson  -  align=\\"center\\" Cyril Francis Davie align=\\"center\\" Cowichan-Newcastle Conservative   align=\\"center\\" Nanaimo Liberal align=\\"center\\" George Sharratt Pearson  -  align=\\"center\\" Fred W.

He was subsequently a U.S. senator from 1897 until 1910. He was the brother of John McEnery, one of the candidates in the contested 1872 election for governor. ==Early life== Mrs Samuel D. McEnery McEnery was born in Monroe in Ouachita Parish in North Louisiana. He attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1859, McEnery graduated from the State and National Law School in Poughkeepsie, New York. McEnery served as a lieutenant in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. ==Career== In 1866, McEnery began practicing law in Monroe. He became active in the Democratic Party, and served as its chairman in Ouachita Parish. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1879, and became Governor of Louisiana in 1881 after the death of Louis A. Wiltz. McEnery was elected to a full term as governor in 1884, but failed to be re-elected in 1888. McEnery's administration was weak because of the power wielded by the State Treasurer Edward A. Burke and the corrupt Louisiana State Lottery Company. Despite Louisiana's Roman Catholic plurality (and majority in Acadiana and many of the southern parishes of the state), McEnery was the last Catholic to be elected governor prior to Edwin Edwards in 1972.After Edwin Edwards, Catholics Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, Bobby Jindal, and John Bel Edwards were elected governors. After losing the 1888 election, McEnery was appointed to serve as an associate justice in the Louisiana Supreme Court. He was elected to serve in the United States Senate in 1896, serving there until his death in 1910. While in the Senate, McEnery served on the Committee of Corporations formed in the District of Columbia and the Committee of Transportation and Sale of Meat Products.For McEnery's positions on the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, see Robert Harrison, Congress, Progressive Reform, and the New American State (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2004), pp. 77, 235, 253. , . ==Death== McEnery died on June 28, 1910, in New Orleans and was interred there at Metairie Cemetery.See the Louisiana Secretary of State's \\"Samuel Douglas McEnery\\" site for McEnery's religious affiliation, date of death, and other information. ==See also== *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900–49) ==NotesRetrieved on 2008-10-19 *State of Louisiana - Biography *Cemetery Memorial by La-Cemeteries * *Samuel D.

Born Trevor Dudley-Smith, he eventually changed his name to Elleston Trevor. Trevor worked in many genres, but is principally remembered for his 1964 adventure story The Flight of the Phoenix, written as Elleston Trevor, and for a series of Cold War thrillers featuring the British secret agent Quiller, written under the pseudonym Adam Hall. In all, Trevor wrote over 100 books. He also wrote as Simon Rattray, Howard North, Roger Fitzalan, Mansell Black, Trevor Burgess, Warwick Scott, Caesar Smith and Lesley Stone. ==Life and work== === Early life === Trevor was born (as Trevor Dudley-Smith) to an alcoholic stockbroker and his (also alcoholic) wife. He hated his prep school, Yardley Court, where he was beaten weekly for doing badly at Latin, and subsequently also disliked Sevenoaks School. He did not attend university, having been apprenticed as a racing driver and then recruited by the RAF as a Flight Engineer for the duration of the Second World War. He also wrote prolifically, having several story-books for children published while still serving in the air force. In the 1950s, he was a bestselling author of military adventure stories, published mainly, at that stage, by Heinemann. His spy writing started in the early 1960s and he was often described in the blurb to his paperbacks as \\"Adam Hall, the mystery author of international bestsellerdom\\", in classic 1960s fashion. ===Private life=== Born Trevor Dudley Smith in Bromley, Kent, he lived after the Second World War in Roedean, by Brighton, Sussex, before relocating out of the UK. He lived in Spain and France for fifteen years before moving in 1973 to the United States, where he lived in Phoenix, Arizona and where he died of cancer, in Cave Creek, in 1995. He was married twice: in 1947 to Jonquil Burgess (died 1986) by whom he had one son, Jean Pierre Trevor, and in 1987 to Chaille Anne Groom.Obituary: Elleston Trevor  The Independent, Jack Adrian, 28 July 1995 He was proficient in karate. He also enjoyed flying kites and racing miniature cars. ===Writing=== The Quiller series focuses on a solitary, highly capable \\"shadow executive\\" (named after Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch) who works (generally alone) for a British agency in Whitehall called \\"the Bureau\\". Officially the organization doesn't exist, which allows a greater latitude to the sometimes- questionable and always hazardous operations it conducts. He narrates his own adventures. Quiller (not his real name) occupies a literary middle ground between James Bond and John le Carré. He is a skilled driver, pilot, diver, martial artist, and linguist, but he does not carry a gun. Regarded by his superiors as \\"reliable under torture\\", Quiller is sometimes captured, then interrogated or tortured without giving away vital information. The series is very stylized, featuring intense depictions of spy tradecraft (especially \\"shadowing,\\" the techniques of tailing and evading surveillance) and professional relationships, surprising jump cuts between chapters, and deep, self-critical, incisive, practically stream-of-consciousness, interior monologues highlighting Quiller's mental self-discipline. Most of the novels feature a high-speed car chase, with Quiller as pursuer or pursued, and an extended, detailed scene of hand-to-hand combat. The first of the Quiller novels, The Berlin Memorandum (1965) (retitled The Quiller Memorandum in the US) won an Edgar Award, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Novel. It was filmed in 1966 under its US title with a screenplay by Harold Pinter and starred George Segal and Alec Guinness. It was also adapted into a 1975 British television series, featuring Michael Jayston. As \\"Simon Rattray,\\" he wrote mystery novels featuring Hugo Bishop, a brilliant man who, like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, solved crimes as a kind of mental challenge. The first Bishop novel, Knight Sinister, appeared in 1951; five more followed, the last appearing in 1957. (These have later been republished under the Adam Hall byline.) That Trevor could also be very effective in the straight, non-mystery genre is shown by The Billboard Madonna (1961): the protagonist accidentally kills a beautiful woman in a car crash, and is obsessively compelled to memorialize her. Under the name \\"Adam Hall,\\" he also wrote The Volcanoes of San Domingo about a mysterious plane crash off the coast of San Domingo and the efforts to uncover what really happened. When alerted by a report indicating that one of the crew members had been seen alive, \\"Rayner,\\" an employee of the airline, is sent to investigate. He also wrote children's books about the character \\"Wumpus\\", a koala, and his friends, including Flip Flap, the penguin. Titles included Wumpus (published 1945, by Gerald G. Swan), and More about Wumpus (published 1947). Other children's books include Scamper-Foot the Pine Marten, Ripple-Swim the Otter, and the Woodlander series (Deep Wood, Green Glade, Sweethallow Valley, Badger's Moon, Badger's Beech, Badger's Wood, Mole's Castle and Panic in the Woodland). His book The Big Pick-Up was one of the stories on which the 1958 film Dunkirk was based. Trevor also wrote radio plays for the BBC. ==Reception== Some of the critical acclaim for the Quiller series: \\"Tense, intelligent, harsh, surprising\\" (The New York Times)...\\"A model of breathless entertainment\\" (The New Yorker)...\\"Stunningly well done, tense, elliptical, without a misplaced word\\" (The New Republic)...\\"You can't go wrong with Quiller\\" (Harper's). ==Works== === Novels === ==== As by Elleston Trevor ==== * The Immortal Error (1946) * Chorus of Echoes (1950) * Redfern's Miracle (1951) * Tiger Street (1951) * A Blaze of Roses (1952); published in the UK as The Fire-Raiser (1970) * The Passion and the Pity (1953) * The Big Pick-Up (1955) * Squadron Airborne (1955) * The Killing Ground (1956) * Gale Force (1956) * The Pillars of Midnight (1957); reissued in the UK as 80,000 Suspects * Dream of Death (1958) * Runaway Man (1958) * Silhouette (1959) * The V.I.P.

The central hub of the American theater scene is New York City, with its divisions of Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway. Many movie and television stars got their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. U.S. theater also has an active community theater culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career. ==Early history== Edwin Forrest, a popular early American actor Before the first English colony was established in 1607, there were Spanish dramas and Native American tribes that performed theatrical events. Although a theater was built in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1716, and the original Dock Street Theatre opened in Charleston, South Carolina in 1736, the birth of professional theater in America may have begun when Lewis Hallam arrived with his theatrical company in Williamsburg in 1752. Lewis and his brother William, who arrived in 1754, were the first to organize a complete company of actors in Europe and bring them to the colonies. They brought a repertoire of plays popular in London at the time, including Hamlet, Othello, The Recruiting Officer, and Richard III. The Merchant of Venice was their first performance, shown initially on September 15, 1752. Encountering opposition from religious organizations, Hallam and his company left for Jamaica in 1754 or 1755. Soon after, Lewis Hallam, Jr., founded the American Company, opened a theater in New York, and presented the first professionally mounted American play—The Prince of Parthia, by Thomas Godfrey—in 1767.The Prince of Parthia: A Tragedy By Thomas Godfrey, reprinted 1917 by Little, Brown. In the 18th century, laws forbidding the performance of plays were passed in Massachusetts in 1750, in Pennsylvania in 1759, and in Rhode Island in 1761, and plays were banned in most states during the American Revolutionary War at the urging of the Continental Congress. In 1794, president of Yale College, Timothy Dwight IV, in his \\"Essay on the Stage\\", declared that \\"to indulge a taste for playgoing means nothing more or less than the loss of that most valuable treasure: the immortal soul.\\" In spite of such laws, however, a few writers tried their hand at playwriting. Most likely, the first plays written in America were by European-born authors—we know of original plays being written by Spaniards, Frenchmen and Englishmen dating back as early as 1567—although no plays were printed in America until Robert Hunter's Androboros in 1714. Still, in the early years, most of the plays produced came from Europe; only with Godfrey's The Prince of Parthia in 1767 do we get a professionally produced play written by an American, although it was a last-minute substitute for Thomas Forrest's comic opera The Disappointment; or, The Force of Credulity, and although the first play to treat American themes seriously, Ponteach; or, the Savages of America by Robert Rogers, had been published in London a year earlier.Meserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama, New York: Feedback/Prospero, 1994. 'Cato', a play about revolution, was performed for George Washington and his troops at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–1778. The Revolutionary period was a boost for dramatists, for whom the political debates were fertile ground for both satire, as seen in the works of Mercy Otis Warren and Colonel Robert Munford, and for plays about heroism, as in the works of Hugh Henry Brackenridge. The postwar period saw the birth of American social comedy in Royall Tyler's The Contrast, which established a much-imitated version of the \\"Yankee\\" character, here named \\"Jonathan\\". But there were no professional dramatists until William Dunlap, whose work as playwright, translator, manager and theater historian has earned him the title of \\"Father of American Drama\\"; in addition to translating the plays of August von Kotzebue and French melodramas, Dunlap wrote plays in a variety of styles, of which André and The Father; or, American Shandyism are his best. ==The 19th century== ===Prewar theater=== At 825 Walnut Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the Walnut Street Theatre, or, \\"The Walnut.\\" Founded in 1809 by the Circus of Pepin and Breschard, \\"The Walnut\\" is the oldest theater in America. The Walnut's first theatrical production, The Rivals, was staged in 1812. In attendance were President Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette. Provincial theaters frequently lacked heat and minimal theatrical property (\\"props\\") and scenery. Apace with the country's westward expansion, some entrepreneurs operated floating theaters on barges or riverboats that would travel from town to town. A large town could afford a long \\"run\\"—or period of time during which a touring company would stage consecutive multiple performances—of a production, and in 1841, a single play was shown in New York City for an unprecedented three weeks. John Drew, a famous American actor, playing the part of Petruchio from The Taming of the Shrew William Shakespeare's works were commonly performed. American plays of the period were mostly melodramas, a famous example of which was Uncle Tom's Cabin, adapted by George Aiken, from the novel of the same name by Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1821, William Henry Brown established the African Grove Theatre in New York City. It was the third attempt to have an African-American theater, but this was the most successful of them all. The company put on not only Shakespeare, but also staged the first play written by an African-American, The Drama of King Shotaway. The theater was shut down in 1823.World Encyclopedia, p. 402 African-American theater was relatively dormant, except for the 1858 play The Escape; or, A Leap for Freedom by William Wells Brown, who was an ex-slave. African-American works would not be regarded again until the 1920s Harlem Renaissance. A popular form of theater during this time was the minstrel show, which featured white (and sometimes, especially after the Civil War, black) actors dressed in \\"blackface (painting one's face, etc. with dark makeup to imitate the coloring of an African or African American).\\" The players entertained the audience using comic skits, parodies of popular plays and musicals, and general buffoonery and slapstick comedy, all with heavy utilization of racial stereotyping and racist themes. Throughout the 19th century, theater culture was associated with hedonism and even violence; actors (especially women) were looked upon as little better than prostitutes. Jessie Bond wrote that by the middle of the 19th century, \\"The stage was at a low ebb, Elizabethan glories and Georgian artificialities had alike faded into the past, stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theater had become a place of evil repute\\". On April 15, 1865, less than a week after the end of the United States Civil War, Abraham Lincoln, while watching a play at Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C., was assassinated by a nationally popular stage-actor of the period, John Wilkes Booth. Victorian burlesque, a form of bawdy comic theater mocking high art and culture, was imported from England about 1860 and in America became a form of farce in which females in male roles mocked the politics and culture of the day. Criticized for its sexuality and outspokenness, this form of entertainment was hounded off the \\"legitimate stage\\" and found itself relegated to saloons and barrooms. The female producers, such as Lydia Thompson were replaced by their male counterparts, who toned down the politics and played up the sexuality, until the burlesque shows eventually became little more than pretty girls in skimpy clothing singing songs, while male comedians told raunchy jokes. The drama of the prewar period tended to be a derivative in form, imitating European melodramas and romantic tragedies, but native in content, appealing to popular nationalism by dramatizing current events and portraying American heroism. But playwrights were limited by a set of factors, including the need for plays to be profitable, the middle-brow tastes of American theater-goers, and the lack of copyright protection and compensation for playwrights. During this time, the best strategy for a dramatist was to become an actor and/or a manager, after the model of John Howard Payne, Dion Boucicault and John Brougham. This period saw the popularity of certain native character types, especially the \\"Yankee\\", the \\"Negro\\" and the \\"Indian\\", exemplified by the characters of Jonathan, Sambo and Metamora. Meanwhile, increased immigration brought a number of plays about the Irish and Germans, which often dovetailed with concerns over temperance and Roman Catholic. This period also saw plays about American expansion to the West (including plays about Mormonism) and about women's rights. Among the best plays of the period are James Nelson Barker's Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father, Anna Cora Mowatt's Fashion; or, Life in New York, Nathaniel Bannister's Putnam, the Iron Son of '76, Dion Boucicault's The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana, and Cornelius Mathews's Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem. At the same time, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show. ===Postwar theater=== During postbellum North, theater flourished as a postwar boom allowed longer and more-frequent productions. The advent of American rail transport allowed production companies, actors, and large, elaborate sets to travel easily between towns, which made permanent theaters in small towns feasible. The invention and practical application of electric lighting also led to changes to and improvements of scenery styles as well as changes in the design of theater interiors and seating areas. Minstrel show performers Rollin Howard (in female costume) and George Griffin, c. 1855. In 1896, Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Flenderson, and J. Fred Zimmerman, Sr. formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which established systemized booking networks throughout the United States, and created a management monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the turn of the 20th century, when the Shubert brothers founded rival agency, The Shubert Organization. For playwrights, the period after the War brought more financial reward and aesthetic respect (including professional criticism) than was available earlier. In terms of form, spectacles, melodramas and farces remained popular, but poetic drama and romanticism almost died out completely due to the new emphasis upon realism, which was adopted by serious drama, melodrama and comedy alike. This realism was not quite the European realism of Ibsen's Ghosts, but a combination of scenic realism (e.g., the \\"Belasco Method\\") with a less romantic view of life that accompanied the cultural turmoil of the period. The most ambitious effort towards realism during this period came from James Herne, who was influenced by the ideas of Ibsen, Hardy and Zola regarding realism, truth, and literary quality; his most important achievement, Margaret Fleming, enacts the principles he expounded in his essay \\"Art for Truth's Sake in the Drama\\". Although Fleming did not appeal to audiences—critics and audiences felt it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as Margaret nursing her husband's bastard child onstage—other forms of dramatic realism were becoming more popular in melodrama (e.g., Augustin Daly's Under the Gaslight) and in local color plays (Bronson Howard's Shenandoah). Other key dramatists during this period are David Belasco, Steele MacKaye, William Dean Howells, Dion Boucicault, and Clyde Fitch. ==The 20th century== Vaudeville was common in the late 19th and early 20th century, and is notable for heavily influencing early film, radio, and television productions in the country. (This was born from an earlier American practice of having singers and novelty acts perform between acts in a standard play.) George Burns was a very long-lived American comedian who started out in the vaudeville community, but went on to enjoy a career running until the 1990s. Some vaudeville theaters built between about 1900 and 1920 managed to survive as well, though many went through periods of alternate use, most often as movie theaters until the second half of the century saw many urban populations decline and multiplexes built in the suburbs. Since that time, a number have been restored to original or nearly-original condition and attract new audiences nearly one hundred years later. By the beginning of the 20th century, legitimate 1752 (non-vaudeville) theater had become decidedly more sophisticated in the United States, as it had in Europe. The stars of this era, such as Ethel Barrymore and John Barrymore, were often seen as even more important than the show itself. The advance of motion pictures also led to many changes in theater. The popularity of musicals may have been due in part to the fact the early films had no sound, and could thus not compete, until The Jazz Singer of 1927, which combined both talking and music in a moving picture. More complex and sophisticated dramas bloomed in this time period, and acting styles became more subdued. Even by 1915, actors were being lured away from theater and to the silver screen, and vaudeville was beginning to face stiff competition. While revues consisting of mostly unconnected songs, sketches, comedy routines, and dancing girls (Ziegfeld girls) dominated for the first 20 years of the 20th century, musical theater would eventually develop beyond this. One of the first major steps was Show Boat, with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein. It featured songs and non-musical scenes which were integrated to develop the show's plot. The next great step forward was Oklahoma!, with lyrics by Hammerstein and music by Richard Rodgers. Its \\"dream ballets\\" used dance to carry forward the plot and develop the characters. Amateur performing groups have always had a place alongside professional acting companies. The Amateur Comedy Club, Inc. was founded in New York City on April 18, 1884. It was organized by seven gentlemen who broke away from the Madison Square Dramatic Organization, a socially prominent company presided over by Mrs. James Brown Potter and David Belasco. The ACC staged its first performance on February 13, 1885. It has performed continuously ever since, making it the oldest, continuously performing theatrical society in the United States. Prominent New Yorkers who have been members of the ACC include Theodore, Frederick and John Steinway of the piano manufacturing family; Gordon Grant, the marine artist; Christopher La Farge, the architect; Van H. Cartmell, the publisher; Albert Sterner, the painter; and Edward Fales Coward, the theater critic and playwright. Elsie De Wolfe, Lady Mendl, later famous as the world's first professional interior decorator, acted in Club productions in the early years of the 20th Century, as did Hope Williams, and Julie Harris in the 1940s. Early 20th century theater was dominated by the Barrymores—Ethel Barrymore, John Barrymore, and Lionel Barrymore. Other greats included Laurette Taylor, Jeanne Eagels, and Eva Le Gallienne. The massive social change that went on during the Great Depression also had an effect on theater in the United States. Plays took on social roles, identifying with immigrants and the unemployed. The Federal Theatre Project, a New Deal program set up by Franklin D. Roosevelt, helped to promote theater and provide jobs for actors. The program staged many elaborate and controversial plays such as It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis and The Cradle Will Rock by Marc Blitzstein. By contrast, the legendary producer Brock Pemberton (founder of the Tony Awards) was among those who felt that it was more than ever a time for comic entertainment, in order to provide an escape from the prevailing harsh social conditions: typical of his productions was Lawrence Riley's comedy Personal Appearance (1934), whose success on Broadway (501 performances) vindicated Pemberton. The years between the World Wars were years of extremes. Eugene O'Neill's plays were the high point for serious dramatic plays leading up to the outbreak of war in Europe. Beyond the Horizon (1920), for which he won his first Pulitzer Prize; he later won Pulitzers for Anna Christie (1922) and Strange Interlude (1928) as well as the Nobel Prize in Literature. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne remained a popular acting couple in the 1930s. 1940 proved to be a pivotal year for African-American theater. Frederick O'Neal and Abram Hill founded ANT, or the American Negro Theater, the most renowned African- American theater group of the 1940s. Their stage was small and located in the basement of a library in Harlem, and most of the shows were attended and written by African-Americans. Some shows include Theodore Browne's Natural Man (1941), Abram Hill's Walk Hard (1944), and Owen Dodson's Garden of Time (1945). Many famous actors received their training at ANT, including Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Alice and Alvin Childress, Osceola Archer, Ruby Dee, Earle Hyman, Hilda Simms, among many others.World Encyclopedia, p. 403 Mid-20th century theater saw a wealth of Great Leading Ladies, including Helen Hayes, Katherine Cornell, Tallulah Bankhead, Judith Anderson, and Ruth Gordon. Musical theater saw stars such as Ethel Merman, Beatrice Lillie, Mary Martin, and Gertrude Lawrence. ===Post World War II theater=== O'Neill stamp issued in 1967 After World War II, American theater came into its own. Several American playwrights, such as Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, became world- renowned. In the 1950s and 1960s, experimentation in the Arts spread into theater as well, with plays such as Hair including nudity and drug culture references. Musicals remained popular as well, and musicals such as West Side Story and A Chorus Line broke previous records. At the same time, shows like Stephen Sondheim's Company began to deconstruct the musical form as it has been practiced through the mid-century, moving away from traditional plot and realistic external settings to explore the central character's inner state; his Follies relied on pastiches of the Ziegfeld Follies-styled revue; his Pacific Overtures used Japanese kabuki theatrical practices; and Merrily We Roll Along told its story backwards. Similarly, Bob Fosse's production of Chicago returned the musical to its vaudeville origins. Facts and figures of the postwar theater The postwar American theater audiences and box offices constantly diminished, due to the undeclared \\"offensive\\" of television and radio upon the classical, legitimate theater. According to James F. Reilly, executive director of the League of New York Theatres, between 1930 and 1951 the number of legitimate theaters in New York City dwindled from 68 to 30. Besides of that, the admissions tax, has been a burden on the theater since 1918. It was never relaxed ever since, and was doubled in 1943.Statement of James F. Reilly, executive director of the League of New York Theatres, New York, N.Y.. Revenue Revision of 1951, hearings, 82nd Congress, p. 2362. Total seating capacity of thirty most renown legitimate theaters amounted 35,697 seats in 1951. Since 1937 in New York City alone, 14 former legitimate theaters with a normal seating capacity of 16,955, have been taken over for either radio broadcasts or television performances.Seating capacity of present/former legitimate theaters. Revenue Revision of 1951, hearings, 82nd Congress, p. 2363. In the late 1990s and 2000s, American theater began to borrow from cinema and operas. For instance, Julie Taymor, director of The Lion King directed Die Zauberflöte at the Metropolitan Opera. Also, Broadway musicals were developed around Disney's Mary Poppins, Tarzan, The Little Mermaid, and the one that started it all, Beauty and the Beast, which may have contributed to Times Square's revitalization in the 1990s. Also, Mel Brooks's The Producers and Young Frankenstein are based on his hit films. ===Drama=== The early years of the 20th century, before World War I, continued to see realism as the main development in drama. But starting around 1900, there was a revival of poetic drama in the States, corresponding to a similar revival in Europe (e.g. Yeats, Maeterlinck and Hauptmann). The most notable example of this trend was the \\"Biblical trilogy\\" of William Vaughn Moody, which also illustrate the rise of religious-themed drama during the same years, as seen in the 1899 production of Ben-Hur and two 1901 adaptations of Quo Vadis. Moody, however, is best known for two prose plays, The Great Divide (1906, later adapted into three film versions) and The Faith Healer (1909), which together point the way to modern American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights from this period (in addition to continued work by Howells and Fitch) include Edward Sheldon, Charles Rann Kennedy and one of the most successful women playwrights in American drama, Rachel Crothers, whose interest in women's issues can be seen in such plays as He and She (1911). During the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of Eugene O'Neill and of the Provincetown Players. O'Neill's experiments with theatrical form and his combination of Naturalist and Expressionist techniques inspired other playwrights to use greater freedom in their works, whether expanding the techniques of Realism, as in Susan Glaspell's Trifles, or borrowing more heavily from German Expressionism (e.g., Elmer Rice's The Adding Machine), Other distinct movements during this period include folk-drama/regionalism (Paul Green's Pulitzer-winning In Abraham's Bosom), \\"pageant\\" drama (Green's The Lost Colony, about the mysterious Roanoke Colony), and even a return to poetic drama (Maxwell Anderson's Winterset). At the same time, the economic crisis of the Great Depression led to the growth of protest drama, as seen in the Federal Theater Project's Living Newspaper productions and in the works of Clifford Odets (e.g., Waiting for Lefty), as well as moralist drama, as in Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes and The Children's Hour. Other key figures of this era include George S. Kaufman, George Kelly, Langston Hughes, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, Robert E. Sherwood, and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, Philip Barry, Thornton Wilder (Our Town) and William Saroyan (The Time of Your Life). Theater criticism kept pace with the drama, such as in the work of George Jean Nathan and in the numerous books and journals on American theater that were published during this time. The stature that American drama had achieved between the Wars was cemented during the post-World War II generation, with the final works of O'Neill and his generation being joined by such towering figures as Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, as well as by the maturation of the musical theater form. Other key dramatists include William Inge, Arthur Laurents and Paddy Chayefsky in the 1950s, the avant garde movement of Jack Richardson, Arthur Kopit, Jack Gelber and Edward Albee the 1960s, and the maturation of black drama through Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka. In the musical theater, important figures include Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, Frank Loesser, Jule Styne, Jerry Bock, Meredith Willson and Stephen Sondheim. The period beginning in the mid-1960s, with the passing of Civil Rights legislation and its repercussions, came the rise of an \\"agenda\\" theater comparable to that of the 1930s. Many of the major midcentury playwrights continued to produce new works, but were joined by names like Sam Shepard, Neil Simon, Romulus Linney, David Rabe, Lanford Wilson, David Mamet, and John Guare. Many important dramatists were women, including Beth Henley, Marsha Norman, Wendy Wasserstein, Megan Terry, Paula Vogel and María Irene Fornés. The growth of ethnic pride movements led to more success by dramatists from racial minorities, such as black playwrights Douglas Turner Ward, Adrienne Kennedy, Ed Bullins, Charles Fuller, Suzan-Lori Parks, Ntozake Shange, George C. Wolfe and August Wilson, who created a dramatic history of United States with his cycle of plays, The Pittsburgh Cycle, one for each decade of the 20th century. Asian American theater is represented in the early 1970s by Frank Chin and achieved international success with David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly. Latino theater grew from the local activist performances of Luis Valdez's Chicano-focused Teatro Campesino to his more formal plays, such as Zoot Suit, and later to the award-winning work of Cuban Americans Fornés (multiple Obies) and her student Nilo Cruz (Pulitzer), to Puerto Rican playwrights José Rivera and Miguel Piñero, and to the Tony Award-winning musical about Dominicans in New York City, In the Heights. Finally, the rise of the gay rights movement and of the AIDS crisis led to a number of important gay and lesbian dramatists, including Christopher Durang, Holly Hughes, Karen Malpede, Terrence McNally, Larry Kramer, Tony Kushner, whose Angels in America won the Tony Award two years in a row, and composer-playwright Jonathan Larson, whose musical Rent ran for over twelve years. ==Contemporary American theater== Although earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape, theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive. At the same time, theater has also served as a platform for expression, and a venue for identity exploration for underrepresented, minority communities, who have formed their own companies and created their own genres of works, notably East West Players, founded in 1965 as the first Asian American theater group. Notable contemporary American playwrights include Edward Albee, August Wilson, Tony Kushner, David Henry Hwang, John Guare, and Wendy Wasserstein. Smaller urban theaters have stayed a source of innovation, and regional theaters remain an important part of theater life. Drama is also taught in high schools and colleges, which was not done in previous eras, and many become interested in theater through this. The Faster Times, an online newspaper that ran from 2009 to 2013, featured a weekly column that discussed issues and trends in American theater. HowlRound, an online forum, features opinions and essays by artists and academics in American Theater today. ==See also== *List of playwrights from the United States *List of American plays *Dance in the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * Burke, Sally.

Theater Theater ","title":"Theater in the United States"},{"id":"1424088","text":"Georges Florovsky Georges Vasilievich Florovsky (Russian: Гео́ргий Васи́льевич Флоро́вский; September 9 [O.S. August 28], 1893 – August 11, 1979) was an Orthodox Christian priest, theologian, historian and ecumenist. Born in Yelisavetgrad, in the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire, he spent his working life in Paris (1920–1949) and New York (1949–1979). With Sergei Bulgakov, Vladimir Lossky, Justin Popović and Dumitru Stăniloae he was one of the more influential Orthodox Christian theologians of the mid-20th century. He was particularly concerned that modern Christian theology might receive inspiration from the lively intellectual debates of the patristic traditions of the undivided Church rather than from later Scholastic or Reformation categories of thought. == Life == Georgiy Vasilievich Florovsky was born in Russian Empire on 9 September 1893 at Odessa (then in the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire), as the fourth child of an Orthodox Christian priest. Raised in an erudite environment, he learned English, German, French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew while a schoolboy, and at eighteen he started to study philosophy and history. He graduated from the University of Odessa in 1916. After his first graduation he taught for three years at high schools in Odessa, and then made his full graduation including the licentia docendi at all universities in the Russian empire. In 1919 Florovsky began to teach at the University of Odessa; but in 1920 his family was forced to leave Russia. Florovsky realized at that time that there would be no return for him, because Marxism did not accept the history and philosophy he taught. He was part of the emigration of Russian intelligentsia, which also included Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Bulgakov, Nicholas Lossky and his son Vladimir Lossky, Alexander Schmemann, and John Meyendorff (the last two of whom would follow him in the USA as Dean of Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, New York). In the 1920s Florovsky had a personal and vocational friendship with the existentialist philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, but the two became distanced later, through Berdyaev's not understanding Florovsky's ordination to the presbyterate (1932), and because of the critical attitude to Berdyaev's philosophy of religion expressed in Florovsky's Ways of Russian Theology (1937). In 1924 Florovsky received his M.A. in Prague. In 1925 he became professor of patristics at the St. Serge Institute of Orthodox Theology in Paris. In this subject he found his vocation. The lively debates of the thinkers of the early Church became for him a benchmark for Christian theology and exegesis, as well as a base for his critique of the ecumenical movement, and despite his not having earned an academic degree in theology (he was later awarded several honorary degrees) he would spend the rest of his life teaching at theological institutions. In 1932 Florovsky was ordained priest of the Orthodox Church. During the 1930s he undertook extensive research in European libraries and published in Russian valuable patristic studies, such as his book on 'Eastern fathers of the fourth century' (1931) and 'The Byzantine fathers fifth to eighth centuries' (1933). These were followed by his magnum opus, Ways of Russian Theology (1937). In this work he questioned the Western- European Christian influences of scholasticism, pietism, and idealism on Orthodox, and especially Russian, Christian theology, and called for its reformulation in the light of patristic writings. The work was received with enthusiasm or condemnation—there was no neutral attitude to it among Russian émigrés. One of his most prominent critics was Nikolai Berdyaev. Florovsky remained professor of patristics at the Institute until 1939, and from 1939 to 1948 taught there as professor of dogmatics. In 1949 Florovsky moved to the United States of America, to take a position as Dean of Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in New York City. There his development of the curriculum led to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York granting the Seminary an Absolute Charter in 1953. In 1955 Florovsky was asked by his synod overseers to \\"lay down the deanship.\\"Andrew Blane, ed., George Florovsky—Russian Intellectual and Orthodox Churchman (1993.

In 1966, it was amalgamated with the Queen's Own Buffs, The Royal Kent Regiment, the Royal Sussex Regiment and the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) to form the Queen's Regiment, which later merged with the Royal Hampshire Regiment in September 1992 to form the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires). ==History== As a consequence of defence cuts in the late 1950s, the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) and the East Surrey Regiment were amalgamated on 14 October 1959 to form the 1st Battalion, Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment. In 1961 the 1st Queen's Surreys was sent to Aden. In 1962 the regiment joined the Hong Kong garrison, remaining there on a 2-year posting before heading for Münster, West Germany in 1964 as part of the British Army of the Rhine. In 1966 the regiment's short existence came to an end when it, along with the three other remaining regiments of the Home Counties Brigade, was amalgamated to form the Queen's Regiment, one of the new 'large' regiments that were formed in the 1960s. ==Territorials== When the regiment was formed, the Territorial Army battalions of the merging regiments continued to use their former titles. However, in 1961, a reduction in the size of the TA lead to the formation of 3rd and 4th Queen's Surreys: *3rd Battalion (TA) was formed of units affiliated to the Queen’s Royal Regiment: the 5th and 6th battalions and the 565th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (the successor to 4th Battalion). Its headquarters were in Guildford. *4th Battalion (TA) was formed from former battalions of the East Surrey Regiment: the 6th East Surreys and the 23rd London Regiment. The battalion headquarters were in Kingston upon Thames. The two territorial battalions were disbanded in 1967, with their successor units in the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) being \\"A\\" Company (Queen's Surreys) of the 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, Queen's Regiment and the 6th (Territorial) Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Queen's Surreys). ==Regimental museum== The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment archives were put in storage when Regimental Headquarters and Museum in the Keep at Kingston upon Thames closed. Colonel JW Sewell reached agreement with the National Trust to re-establish the regiment's museum at Clandon House, West Clandon. The regiment's archives and library are located at the Surrey History Centre in Woking. The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment Museum opened in 1981 with exhibits including uniforms, medals, weapons, regalia, photographs and memorabilia. The museum was upgraded in 2001. In 2011, with part funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund further redevelopment took place and, in July that year, the museum merged with those of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment and the Queen’s Regiment to become The Surrey Infantry Museum. On 29 April 2015, a blaze ripped through Clandon Park House with the remains of the roof and upper floors of the house collapsing into the basement area where the museum was based. All artifacts made of combustible materials were lost, but a number of fire-resistant objects, especially medals, have since been recovered. The museum's displayed medal collection included replicas of six Victoria Crosses, including those awarded to: Lieutenant Wallace Duffield Wright, Lance Corporal Leonard James Keyworth, Corporal John McNamara and Second Lieutenant Arthur Fleming-Sandes. ==Regimental Colonels== The Colonels of the Regiment were: *1959–1964: Maj-Gen. John Francis Metcalfe, CB, CBE *1964–1966: Maj-Gen. Francis James Claude Piggott, CB, CBE, DSO (to Queen's Regiment as Deputy Colonel) ==Alliances== The regiment's alliances included: * The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) -- Canada (1959–1966) * South Alberta Light Horse—Canada (1959–1966) * 2nd Infantry Battalion (The City of Newcastle Regiment) -- Australia (1959–60) * Royal New South Wales Regiment—Australia (1960–1966) * The Northern Rhodesian Regiment (1959–1964) ==Freedoms== * 1964: Battersea. ==ReferencesSurrey Infantry Museum Category:Infantry regiments of the British Army Category:Military units and formations established in 1959 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1966 Category:Military units and formations in Surrey ","title":"Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment"},{"id":"1424118","text":"Vinca (;Stearn, W. T. (1983). Botanical Latin ed. 3. David & Charles . Latin: vincire \\"to bind, fetter\\") is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, native to Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia.Flora Europaea: VincaEuroMed Plantbase Project: VincaFlora of Pakistan: VincaAltervista Flora Italiana, genere Vinca included photos plus European distribution maps The English name periwinkle is shared with the related genus Catharanthus (and also with the common seashore mollusc, Littorina littorea). ==Description== Vinca difformis in habitat, Cáceres, Spain Vinca plants are subshrubs or herbaceous, and have slender trailing stems long but not growing more than above ground; the stems frequently take root where they touch the ground, enabling the plant to spread widely. The leaves are opposite, simple broad laneolate to ovate, long and broad; they are evergreen in four species, but deciduous in the herbaceous V. herbacea, which dies back to the root system in winter.Blamey, M., & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Hodder & Stoughton.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening 4: 664-665. Macmillan. The flowers, produced through most of the growing season, are salverform (like those of Phlox), simple, broad, with five usually violet (occasionally white) petals joined together at the base to form a tube. The fruit consists of a pair of divergent follicles; the dry fruit dehisces along one rupture site to release seeds. ==Gardens== Two of the species, Vinca major and Vinca minor, are extensively cultivated as a flowering evergreen ornamental plant. Because the plants are low and spread quickly, they are often used as groundcover in garden landscapes and container gardens. They are also traditionally used in older cemeteries as an evergreen maintenance-free ground cover. Many cultivars are available, with different plant, leaf, and flower colors, sizes, and habits. ===Invasive plant species=== Although attractive, both Vinca major and Vinca minor may be invasive in some regions where they are introduced species because the rapid spreading chokes out native plant species and alters habitats. Areas affected include parts of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States, especially coastal California.Global Compendium of Weeds: Vinca majorGlobal Compendium of Weeds: Vinca minorVinca plants spreading along a border == Medicinal use == The vinca alkaloids include at least 86 alkaloids extracted from plants in the genus Vinca. The chemotherapy agent vincristine is extracted from a closely related species, Catharanthus roseus, and is used to treat some leukemias, lymphomas, and childhood cancers, as well as several other types of cancer and some non-cancerous conditions. Vinblastine is a chemical analogue of vincristine and is also used to treat various forms of cancer. Dimeric alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine are produced by the coupling the smaller indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine. In addition, the nootropic agent vincamine is derived from Vinca minor. Vinorelbine, a newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent, is used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and is prepared either from the natural products leurosine or catharanthine and vindoline, in both cases by first preparing anhydrovinblastine. ==Species== Accepted species: # Vinca difformis Pourr. – Azores, western and central Mediterranean # Vinca erecta Regel & Schmalh. – Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan # Vinca herbacea Waldst. & Kit. – central, eastern and southeastern Europe; Middle East # Vinca major L. – southern Europe, Turkey, Syria, Caucasus; introduced to and established in New Zealand, California, British Isles, central Europe, Ukraine, North Africa, south China, Canary Islands, Madeira, North America, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala # Vinca minor L. – central and southeastern Europe, Ukraine, Caucasus; introduced to and established in British Isles, Scandinavia, Portugal, Turkey, south China, North America, New Zealand # Vinca soneri Koyuncu – Turkey ==References== ==External links== * Category:Apocynaceae genera Category:Flora of Asia Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of North Africa Category:Garden plants of Africa Category:Garden plants of Europe Category:Groundcovers Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Subshrubs ","title":"Vinca"},{"id":"1424130","text":"Henry Edward Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn (8 September 1780 – 29 October 1810) was a British peer. He was a tenant and sometime friend of Lord Byron. ==Life== The title of Baron Grey de Ruthyn had a long history and had belonged to the Earl of Kent for a period. It passed to the Earl of Sussex from 1717, the Yelvertons. Henry Yelverton, 18th Baron Grey de Ruthyn, 3rd Earl of Sussex died in 1799, with no sons. The Grey de Ruthyn title therefore passed to 19-year-old Henry, son of the Earl's daughter, Lady Barbara Yelverton (who had died in 1781) and her husband, Edward Thoroton Gould, who was the grandson of Robert Thoroton Esq. of Screveton Hall, Flintham, Nottinghamshire.Edward Thorton Gould, Esq., Obituary, The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. C, Sylvanus Urban, London, 1830Thoroton's History of Nottinghamshire, Vol. 2, Robert Thoroton, J. Throsby, London, 1797 The younger Yelverton could not inherit the title of Earl of Sussex through his mother. Lord Grey took his seat in the House of Lords as a Whig. On 21 June 1809, he married Anna Maria Kellam, daughter of William Kellam, of Ryton-upon-Dunsmore, Warwick. Byron wrote from his European trip to his mother: \\"So Lord G— is married to a rustic. Well done! If I wed, I will bring home a Sultana, with half a dozen cities for a dowry, and reconcile you to an Ottoman daughter-in- law, with a bushel of pearls not larger than ostrich eggs, or smaller than walnuts.\\" The couple had one daughter, Barbara, born on 20 May 1810 (later Barbara Rawdon-Hastings, Marchioness of Hastings). In October of the same year, Grey died at his seat of Brandon House, near Coventry, aged 30. ==Lord Grey and Newstead Abbey== Lord Byron had inherited Newstead Abbey with his title; the estate was leased to Lord Grey, from January 1803, until Byron came of age. Later that year, Byron stayed at Newstead Abbey for the summer whilst Grey was traveling abroad. When Grey returned, Byron stayed on, not returning for the Autumn term at Harrow. He and Grey became friends, spending their days and nights on shooting expeditions. Then Byron suddenly broke off their friendship and left Newstead. Byron wrote to his half-sister, Augusta Leigh: \\"I am not reconciled to Lord Grey, and I never will. He was once my Greatest Friend, my reasons for ceasing that Friendship are such as I cannot explain, not even to you, my Dear Sister, (although were they to be made known to any body, you would be the first) but they will ever remain hidden in my own breast.\\" Byron's mother was keen on a reconciliation. Byron wrote again to his sister of his troubles with his mother: \\"all our disputes have been lately heightened by my one with that object of my cordial, deliberate detestation, Lord Grey de Ruthyn.\\" Byron's later apologetic letters to Grey and Grey's inability to understand his young friend's breaking-off of their relationship may point to a sexual relationship that Byron later regretted. They were not reconciled. In April 1808, Lord Grey left Newstead at the end of his lease. ==References== Category:1780 births Category:1810 deaths Henry Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn Category:Barons Grey of Ruthin ","title":"Henry Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn"},{"id":"1424143","text":"Phyllanthus emblica Triphala (\\"three fruits\\") is an Ayurvedic herbal rasayana formula consisting of equal parts of three myrobalans, taken without seed: Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica), Bibhitaki (Terminalia bellirica), and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula).

He was also a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1950 to 1958, and a representative from the 2nd congressional district of Maryland in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963. ==Biography== ===Early life and ancestors=== Daniel Baugh Brewster, Jr. was born on November 23, 1923, in Baltimore County, Maryland, in the Green Spring Valley Region. He was one of six children of Ottolie Y. (Wickes) and Daniel Baugh Brewster, Sr. He attended the Gilman School in Baltimore, Maryland.Obituary: \\"Daniel Baugh Brewster\\" New York Times. May 16, 1934. He was a great-grandson of Benjamin Harris Brewster (1816–1888), an attorney and politician from New Jersey who served as United States Attorney General from 1881 to 1885 and was himself a descendent of Mayflower passenger William Brewster. He was also a great-great-great-grandson of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache and a great-great-great-great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. He is also related to George Mifflin Dallas (July 10, 1792 – December 31, 1864), a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania and the 11th Vice President of the United States, serving under James K. Polk. ===Education=== He was educated at the Gilman School in Baltimore City and St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He attended college at Princeton University, and Johns Hopkins University before the U.S. entry into World War II. After the war, he completed his undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins, then enrolled in the University of Maryland Law School. He was admitted to the Bar in 1949, commencing law practice in Towson, Maryland, soon after. ===Personal=== Brewster had two sons, Daniel Baugh Brewster, Jr. (1956) and Gerry Leiper Brewster (1958) from his first marriage to Carol Leiper DeHavenon of Philadelphia.Obituary: \\"Carol L. Brewster\\" Washington Post. February 10, 2010. They married in 1954, and after thirteen years of marriage, in March 1967, they publicly announced their separation. On April 29, 1967, Brewster married Anne Moen Bullitt Biddle (1924–2007) at Glyndon, Maryland. SheObituary: \\"Anne Moen Bullitt Biddle\\" New York Times. September 2, 2007. was the daughter of journalist Louise Bryant and William C. Bullitt from their marriage in 1923. Bryant, her mother, was the widow of John Reed, who wrote Ten Days That Shook the World while living in Moscow through the Bolshevik revolution; while Bullitt, her father, served as ambassador to the Soviet Union and France under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Anne Biddle was previously married to Caspar Wistar Barton Townsend, Jr., Nicholas Duke Biddle and Roderic More O'Ferrall. This, Brewster's second marriage, ended in 1969. In 1976, Brewster married Judy Lynn Aarsand, and had three children, Danielle (1977) and twins Jennilie and Dana (1979). ===Military service=== In 1942, Brewster enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was commissioned from the ranks in 1943. During World War II, he served in the Pacific theatre, including participating in the Battle of Guam and the Battle of Okinawa. For his actions during the war, he received a Bronze Star. He was wounded seven times, receiving a Purple Heart and a Gold Star in lieu of a second award. He left active duty in 1946, but continued in the Reserve until 1972, reaching the rank of colonel. ==Political career== ===Maryland state politics=== Brewster, a Democrat, was elected as to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1950 and he served until 1958. ===National politics=== In 1958, he was elected to the House of Representatives from the 2nd district of Maryland, defeating the Republican candidate, J. Fife Symington, Jr. He was a member of the House during the Eighty-sixth (1959–1961) and Eighty-seventh Congresses (1961–1963)—serving on the House Armed Services Committee and on the subcommittee on Military Personnel, Manpower Utilization, and Emergency Defense Transportation. In the House, Brewster voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1960. In 1962, he ran for the United States Senate seat vacated by the retiring Republican senator John Marshall Butler, and defeated Congressman Edward Tylor Miller to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Maryland since 1946. He served in the Senate from 1963 to 1969. In the Senate, Brewster voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. He was defeated in the 1968 election by Charles Mathias. In 1964, he ran in the Democratic presidential primaries against segregationist George Wallace. As Lyndon Johnson refused to run nationally, \\"favorite sons\\" were run in his place against Wallace, such as Matthew E. Welsh of Indiana and John W. Reynolds of Wisconsin. Brewster won his state's primary but was embarrassed by Wallace's showing of 43 percent. As is required, Maryland delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention voted for Brewster on the first ballot, then voted for Lyndon Johnson. ===Political positions and voting record=== Brewster focused on issues ranging from the presence of communist troops in Cuba in 1963 to proposed cuts in weekend postal service in 1964. His concern with mail practices continued in 1965 when he criticized the current \\"mail cover\\" practice which permitted holding up mail to and from persons under investigation. Stressing the importance of the right of privacy, Brewster urged U.S. Postmaster General Larry O'Brien to ban the practice except in cases of treason and national security. In a November 1966 letter to the New York Times, Brewster declared his support for advertising or \\"junk\\" mail, which he claimed accounted for $35 billion in sales. Pointing out that 80% of the mail is for business purposes, Brewster expressed concern over possible unemployment in private business and the postal service if \\"junk mail\\" is eliminated. In 1967, he voted for a \\"junk mail\\" amendment, which would delay price increases and limit 3rd class mail rates to 3.8 cents a piece. Brewster also played a strong supporting role in national Democratic politics. Brewster was instrumental in the passage of the monumental Civil Rights Act of 1964. ===Bribery charges=== In 1969, Brewster was indicted on 10 criminal counts of solicitation and acceptance of bribes while a United States Senator, in his role as a member of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service; as well as two counts of accepting illegal gratuities. This stemmed from a campaign contribution by Spiegel, Inc., a mail-order firm. He contended that he had done nothing wrong. At trial, the judge dismissed five of the charges, saying that Brewster's actions were protected under the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The prosecution appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard the case in 1971 and 1972. In June 1972, the Court held 6 to 3 in United States v. Brewster that the taking of illegal bribes was not protected speech, as taking of a bribe was not part of the \\"performance of a legislative function.\\" The charges were reinstated. Brewster stood trial and was found \\"not guilty\\" of the bribery charges but was convicted of accepting an unlawful gratuity \\"without corrupt intent.\\" However, in August 1974, his conviction was overturned on appeal due to the trial judge's improper instructions to the jury. In 1975, he pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of accepting an illegal gratuity \\"without corrupt intent\\" and was fined and allowed to keep his law license. The government dropped the other charges. ===Later years=== After leaving the Senate, Brewster took up farming in Glyndon, Maryland. He died of liver cancer on August 19, 2007, at age 83. He is buried at Saint Thomas' Episcopal Church Cemetery, Owings Mills, Maryland.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress ==Legacy== Among Brewster's United States Senate staff in the 1960s were intern Nancy D'Alesandro (later Pelosi) of Baltimore, who as a Congresswoman from California would become Democratic leader and, in 2007, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Steny Hoyer, who served on Senator Brewster's staff for five years from 1962 to 1966 and who served as House Majority Leader under Pelosi. == External Links == * Daniel Brewster papers at the University of Maryland Libraries ==See also== *List of American federal politicians convicted of crimes *List of federal political scandals in the United States ==References== ==Notes== Retrieved on 2008-01-24 * * Category:1923 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:Candidates in the 1964 United States presidential election Brewster Category:Deaths from cancer in Maryland Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Franklin family Category:Gilman School alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Lawyers from Baltimore Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Maryland politicians convicted of crimes Category:Members of the Maryland House of Delegates Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland Category:Military personnel from Baltimore Category:Politicians from Baltimore Category:United States Marine Corps colonels Category:United States Marine Corps reservists Category:United States senators from Maryland Category:University of Maryland School of Law alumni Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Daniel Brewster"},{"id":"1424148","text":"Environmental restoration is closely allied with (or perhaps sometimes used interchangeably with) ecological restoration or environmental remediation. In the U.S., remediation is the term used more in the realms of industry, public policy, and civil services. Environmental restoration is a term common in the citizens’ environmental movement. In the 1987 edition of his book Restoring the Earth: How Americans are Working to Renew our Damaged Environment, scientific editor and writer John J. Berger defined environmental restoration (or “natural resource restoration”) as follows: \\"… A process in which a damaged resource is renewed. Biologically. Structurally. Functionally.\\" ==Natural environment== The ongoing growth of the human population in the world and its associated impacts, mean that the need for ecological restoration has become increasingly clear. The old adage \\"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\\" points to the fact that ecological restoration is not always successful (or only over long spans of time) and, when feasible, is often difficult and expensive. Environmental restoration is often neglected, either being overlooked or being deemed inexpedient or of a low priority. However, in much of the industrialized world, it has been increasingly demanded by the public, at least since the early 1970s if not before. The interest and activity in environmental restoration have given rise to a new branch of research and applied techniques within biology, restoration ecology. Environmental restoration has been applied in aquatic situations (lake environmental restoration, streams environmental restoration, rivers environmental restoration, wetlands environmental restoration, etc.) and terrestrial ones (grasslands, forests, deserts, flatlands, hill country, mountain slopes, etc.). ==Approaches== Environmental restoration involves many different approaches and technologies depending on the requirements of the situation. It can involve heavy equipment like cranes, graders, bulldozers, or excavators, and also hand processes like the planting of trees and other vegetation. It can involve high-tech processes such as those applied in the careful environmental control required in fish-hatchery procedures. Today, computerized regulation is often being utilized in these processes. Computer- based mapping has also become an important dimension of restorative work, as has computer modelling. In some situations, environmental restorative work is handled entirely by professionals working with skilled operators and technicians. In others, ordinary local community members may do much of the work, acquiring skills as the project proceeds. An example of this approach can be seen in Project Maitai where the Nelson City Council, New Zealand, has worked with community groups, such as Friends of the Maitai and local schools, to restore the Maitai River and its tributaries.Project Maitai ==Ecological restoration markets== Although the international field of restoration is driven primarily by the non-profit, government and academic sectors, in the U.S and certain other countries (e.g. Australia, which has a robust mining restoration sector), there are active markets for ecological restoration. The U.S. market blossomed shortly after Congress passed the Clean Water ActUnited States. Clean Water Act (1972; amended 1977). Section 404. and the Environmental Protection Agency issued implementing regulations aimed at preventing the loss of streams and wetlands, and in the wake of the passage of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.United States. Endangered Species Act of 1973. . The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 also created restoration opportunities.United States. Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. When regulations stemming from these laws came online in the mid-1980s, there were few firms that were qualified or experienced in performing large-scale restoration projects. The first estimate of the dollars and jobs in the U.S. was $9.5 billion in annual sales, with 126,000 people employed. ==See also== *Biodegradation *Bioremediation *Buffalo Commons *Dutch standards *Industrial nature *List of environment topics *Natural attenuation *Phytoremediation *Richard St. Barbe Baker *Stream restoration ==References== ==External links== *Society for Ecological Restoration *Stream Restoration Links *Restoration Ecology Links *Restore the Earth site *Arid Lands and Desert Restoration * Sustainable Ecological Restoration . * American Society of Professional Wetland Engineers (ASPWE) *EEMP - a non-profit 501 (c) 3 organization dedicated to communicate the lessons of rehabilitation through media around the world.

Sakya Pandita is accompanied by his nephew Chogyal Phagpa Drogön Chogyal Phagpa (; 1235 – 15 December 1280), was the fifth leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. He was also the first Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty, division of the Mongol Empire, and was concurrently named the director of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. Historical tradition remembers him as the first vice-ruler of Tibet under the Mongol Khagan as well as one of the Five Sakya patriarchs (). Although this is historically disputed, he played a very important political role. ==Early life== Phagpa was born in Ngari (West Tibet) in 1235 as the son of Sönam Gyeltsen (, 1184-1239), a member of the Khon family () which held hereditary power over the Sakya Monastery in the Tsang region, and his mother was Kunga Kyi (). The Red annals name his mother as Jomo Konchog Kyi.Shoju Inaba (1963) \\"The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals\\", Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22, p. 108. He was the nephew of Sakya Pandita (1182-1251), who began the relationship between Sakya and the Mongol conquerors after their first invasion of Tibet in 1240. In 1244, Sakya Pandita left Sakya in order to visit the royal camp of Godan Khan, son of Ögedei Khan, to act as intermediary between the Mongols and Tibetans. He brought with him his young nephews, the ten years-old Phagpa and his brother, the six years-old Chakna Dorje. On the way, they stopped in Lhasa, where Phagpa took the vows of a śrāmaṇera at the Jokhang in front of the statue of the Jowo offered by the Princess Wencheng, the Chinese wife of Songtsen Gampo.Thomas Laird (2006) The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama, pp. 114-117. Grove Press, New York. . Sakya Pandita preached sermons along his way and arrived at Godan's camp in Liangzhou in 1247, where Mongol troops were exterminating Han Chinese by throwing them in a river.Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa (1967) Tibet: A Political History. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 63. Sakya Pandita, horrified, gave religious instructions, in particular stressing that killing a sentient being is one of the worst acts according to Buddhism. He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Godan of a serious illness.Thubten Jigme Norbu and Colin Turnbull (1969) Tibet: Its History, Religion and People. In return, Drogon Chogyel Phagpa was supposedly given \\"temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [Trikor Chuksum] of Central Tibet.\\"Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa (1967) p. 63. Since the myriarchies had not yet emerged as a territorial unit, this cannot be entirely correct. Tibetan historians quote a letter that Sakya Pandita wrote to the local leaders of Tibet in 1249 where he stated that they henceforth must carry out the administration of their fiefs in consultation with the Sakya envoys and in accordance with Mongol law.Luciano Petech (1990) Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Yüan-Sa skya pa period in Tibetan history. Rome, p. 9. There are some questions about the authencity of the letter that Sakya Pandita wrote to the Tibetans; see David P. Jackson (1987) 'Sa-skya Pandita's letter to the Tibetans'. ==Entering the service of Kublai Khan== After the death of Sakya Pandita, the Mongol ruler Möngke Khan dispatched new military campaigns against parts of Tibet in 1252-53. He furthermore shared up the main Tibetan sects among the ruling clan. While he patronized the Drikung Kagyu, Godan protected Sakya and there were at least nine further appanages. Phagpa and his brother remained at the camp of Godan, learned the Mongolian language and took up Mongol dress. Möngke's brother Kublai, after a brief flirtation with Chan Buddhism, found Tibetan Buddhism more to his liking. In 1253 he asked Godan to give him Chögyal Phagpa, who was then 18. Kublai was subsequently converted to Buddhism by his efforts and Phagpa became his tantric guru in 1258. Under the influence of Kublai's wife Chabi, their mutual relation was defined so that Phagpa had a precedence in religious matters and Kublai in temporal affairs. When the prince received religious instruction from his lama, the latter sat on a higher seat, while Kublai sat higher than Phagpa when he conducted court business. Phagpa further strengthened his case by defeating his Daoist opponents in a great debate in Kublai's newly built city Kaiping in 1258.Morris Rossabi (1988) Khubilai Khan: His life and times. Berkeley, p. 41-2. Shortly after, Kublai Khan took power in a succession struggle after the death of his brother Möngke in 1259. He thereby became the Khagan, the ruler of the Mongols; later on, he became the Emperor of China. Phagpa supported the new lord by presenting him as a chakravartin or universal ruler.Matthew Kapstein (2006) The Tibetans. Oxford, p. 112. Kublai Khan in turn appointed Chögyal Phagpa as his National Preceptor (Guoshi) in 1260, the year when he was proclaimed Khagan. According to Mongol sources, Phagpa was the first one \\"to initiate the political theology politics of the relationship between state and religion in the Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist world\\"F. W. Mote (1999) Imperial China 900-1800. Harvard University Press, p. 501 \\\\- that is to say, he developed the concept of the patron and priest relationship. With the support of Kublai Khan, Chögyal Phagpa established himself and the Sakya as the preeminent political power in Tibet. ==Development of the ʼPhags pa script== Kublai Khan commissioned Chögyal Phagpa to design a new writing system to unify the writing of the multilingual Yuan China. Phagpa modified the Tibetan alphabet to create his ʼPhags pa script, which was completed in 1269. Kublai Khan decided to use the ʼPhags-pa script as the official writing system of the empire, including when he became Emperor of China in 1271, instead of Chinese characters or the Old Uyghur alphabet formerly used for Mongolian. However, he encountered major resistances and difficulties when trying to promote this script and never achieved his original goal. As a result, only a small amount of texts were written in this script, and the majority (including most official documents) were still written in Chinese ideograms or the Uyghur alphabet.Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 158 The script fell into disuse after the collapse of the Yuan in 1368. The script was used for about a century and is thought to have influenced the development of Hangul. Phagpa's diaries for 1271 mention a foreign friend of Kublai Khan, who was quite possibly one of the elder Polos or even Marco Polo, although, unfortunately, no name is given.Piotr Klafkowski (1977). \\"History of Buddhism in Mongolia—A Preliminary Survey\\", Buddhist Studies. The Journal of the Department of Buddhist Studies, University of Delhi. May, 1977, p. 28 and note. ==Creation of the Sakya-Yuan administrative system== Tibet within the Yuan dynasty under the top-level department known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan). The Sakya-Mongol alliance was strong, and the see () of the Sakya became the capital of Tibet. According to later historiography, Kublai Khan (who founded of the Yuan dynasty in 1271) granted the three cholka or regions of Tibet (Ü-Tsang, Amdo and Kham) to Phagpa as a reward for the initiation in the Buddhist faith.George Roerich (1976) The Blue Annals. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p. 216. The donation would have taken place in 1253. However, this tradition has been qualified by recent research. As mentioned above, Kublai's brother and predecessor Möngke Khan divided Central Tibet into appanages obedient under various Mongol princes in 1251. In the next year he issued a decree saying that the main Buddhist precepts to be followed in Tibet were to be those of Sakya.Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 10-2. In about 1260 the appanage system was withdrawn, and Phagpa, receiving the title State Preceptor (Guoshi), was acknowledged as the supreme head of the Buddhist clergy. In 1264, Kublai Khan established the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. At about the same time, Phagpa was sent from the court to Tibet in order to persuade the local leaders to accept the imposition of Mongol administration. It was his first visit to his homeland since childhood.Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 143 Phagpa received the new title of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in 1270, partly as a reward for his invention of the Phagpa script. As such, he was expected to stay close to the emperor and had a paramount influence over the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. His decrees carried the weight of the imperial court which gave him a strong authority over Tibetan affairs. However, Phagpa mostly resided in Lintao in Gansu and apparently had desultory contacts with the emperor. He vacated the post by 1274 and returned to Sakya, leaving the title to his brother, Rinchen Gyaltsen.Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 16-23. Kublai Khan made Phagpa's other brother Chakna Dorje viceroy of Tibet in 1264. However, he died in 1267 and no new viceroy was appointed for many years.Luciano Petech (1990) p. 20. His untimely death was followed by a rebellion led by the Drikung Kagyu, the main opponents of the Sakya. Kublai Khan sent a punitive force to Tibet, which suppressed the uprising by 1268.Morris Rossabi (1988) p. 144. Temporal administration of Tibet was actually in the hands of officials from Sakya known as dpon-chen or pönchen. Their functions were defined as follows: \\"He governs by order of the lama and by the mandate of the emperor. He protects the two laws (religious and civil) and keeps the realm tranquil and the religion flourishing.\\"Luciano Petech (1990) p. 44. A dpon-chen with responsibility for Central Tibet was stationed in Sakya from c. 1264. An implemented Mongol rule began about 1268-69 when a census was carried out and a Mongol administrative structure was set up. By this time Central Tibet was divided into 13 trikor, usually rendered in English as \\"myriarchies\\", each under a local lord called tripon. Meanwhile, other Sakya dpon-chen resided in Gongyo in Doto (Kham) and Lingtsang in Doma (Amdo).Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 43-61. The dpon-chen of Ü-Tsang in this period were: * Shakya Zangpo (c. 1264-1270) * Kunga Zangpo (c. 1270-1275) * Zhangtsun (c. 1275-?) * Chukpo Gangkarwa (?-1280) ==Last years and death== Phagpa and his successors as Sakya lamas were not literally viceroys under the Yuan although they were at the center of the Yuan administrative system in Tibet. Moreover, after Phagpa the offices of Imperial Preceptor and Sakya Trizin were kept strictly separate. While the later chronicles depict Phagpa and his successors as ruling over the 13 myriarchies and in an extended sense over the three cholka,Giuseppe Tucci (1949) Tibetan painted scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 651. the authority of the Sakya Trizin was restricted to spiritual affairs. Given the paramount importance of the Buddhist religious hierarchy in Tibet, this still gave him an amount of influence. Phagpa spent his last years in Tibet, where he was busy strengthening Sakya-Yuan authority over the still-restless country. He convened a general conference of the Buddhist hierarchs in 1277 with both spiritual and political leanings. He died in the Lhakhang palace in Sakya on 15 December 1280. There was an unsubstantiated rumour that he had been poisoned by the former pönchen Kunga Zangpo, whom he had dismissed some years previously for highhanded conduct. This led to an armed intervention by an army of Mongols and Amdo Tibetans in the next year, resulting in the execution of Kunga Zangpo and the strengthening of Mongol military presence in Tibet.Luciano Petech (1990) pp. 24-5. The system lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th Sakya Trizin, Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen, the myriarch Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty began to expand his power in the central province of Ü, marking the \\"beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet.\\"Sandra Penny-Dimri (1995) \\"The Lineage of His Holiness Sakya Trizin Ngawang-Kunga\\", The Tibet Journal, Vol. XX No. 4, Winter 1995, pp. 71-73. ==Cultural references== Phagpa is played by James Hong in the 1982 miniseries Marco Polo. In the series he is erroneously depicted as alive at the time of the departure of Marco Polo from China in 1293. ==Translations== Chogyal Phagpa: The Emperor's Guru (Sakya Kongma Series Book 5).

It is ancestral to Manchu. In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchen people and Jurchen language, \\"Manchu\\". ==Writing== pass with the Jurchen inscription gurun ni xada-xun, meaning \\"Trust of the Country\\". A writing system for Jurchen language was developed in 1119 by Wanyan Xiyin. A number of books were translated into Jurchen, but none have survived, even in fragments. Surviving samples of Jurchen writing are quite scarce. One of the most important extant texts in Jurchen is the inscription on the back of \\"the Jin Victory Memorial Stele\\" (), which was erected in 1185, during the reign of Emperor Shizong. It is apparently an abbreviated translation of the Chinese text on the front of the stele.Hoyt Cleveland Tillman, Stephen H. West, China Under Jurchen Rule: Essays on Chin Intellectual and Cultural History. Published by SUNY Press, 1995. . Partial text on Google Books. Pp. 228–229 A number of other Jurchen inscriptions exist as well. For example, in the 1950s a tablet was found in Penglai, Shandong, containing a poem in Jurchen by a poet called (in Chinese transcription) Aotun Liangbi. Although written in Jurchen, the poem was composed using the Chinese \\"regulated verse\\" format known as qiyan lüshi. It is speculated that the choice of this format—rather than something closer to the Jurchen folk poetry was due to the influence of the Chinese literature on the educated class of the Jurchens. ==Ming-dynasty Jurchen dictionaries== The two most extensive resources on the Jurchen language available to today's linguists are two dictionaries created during the Ming Dynasty by the Chinese government's Bureau of Translators (Siyi Guan) and the Bureau of Interpreters (, Huitong Guan). Both dictionaries were found as sections of the manuscripts prepared by those two agencies, whose job was to help the imperial government to communicate with foreign nations or ethnic minorities, in writing or orally, respectively.Kane (1989); pp. 90–98, as well as most of the rest of the book Although the Bureau of Translators' multilingual dictionary (, Huá-Yí yìyǔ, 'Sino-Barbarian Dictionary') was known to Europeans since 1789 (thanks to Jean Joseph Marie Amiot), a copy of the Huá-Yí yìyǔ with a Jurchen section was not discovered until the late 19th century, when it was studied and published by Wilhelm Grube in 1896. Soon research continued in Japan and China as well. It was this dictionary which first made serious study of the Jurchen language possible. This dictionary contained translation of Chinese words into Jurchen, given in Jurchen characters and in phonetic transcription into Chinese characters (rather imprecise, since the transcription was done by means of Chinese characters).Kane (1989); pp. 90–95. The vocabulary lists compiled by the Bureau of Interpreters became first known to the Western scholars in 1910, and in 1912 L. Aurousseau reported the existence of a manuscript of it with a Jurchen section, supplied to him by Yang Shoujing.Kane (1989); p. 96. This dictionary is similar in its structure to the one from the Bureau of Translators, but it only gives the \\"phonetic\\" transcription of Jurchen words (by means of Chinese characters) and not their writing in Jurchen script.Franke (1994), p. 688 The time of its creation is not certain; various scholars thought that it could have been created as late as (by Mao Ruicheng) or as early as 1450–1500;Kane (1989); p. 99–100. Daniel Kane's analysis of the dictionary, published in 1989, surmises that it may have been written in the first half of the 16th century, based on the way the Jurchen words are transcribed into Chinese.Kane (1989); p. 129. Both dictionaries record very similar forms of the language, which can be considered a late form of Jurchen, or an early form of Manchu. According to modern researchers, both dictionaries were compiled by the two Bureaus' staff, who were not very competent in Jurchen. The compilers of the two dictionaries were apparently not very familiar with Jurchen grammar. The language, in Daniel Kane's words, was geared to basic communications \\"with 'barbarians', when this was absolutely inevitable, or when they brought tribute to the Court\\". ==Jurchen words in Chinese texts== Besides the inscriptions and one or two surviving manuscripts in Jurchen script, some important information on the Jurchen language is provided by the Jurchen words, transcribed using Chinese characters in Chinese documents. These include:Kane (1989), p. 38–41 * The list of 125 Jurchen words in Jin Guoyu Jie (\\"Explanation of the national language of the Jin\\" 金國語解), an appendix to the History of Jin. Alexander Wylie translated the list into English and Manchu. * Jurchen names and words throughout the History of Jin. * An appendix with Jurchen words in Da Jin guozhi (\\"The veritable annals of the Jin Dynasty\\"), the text prepared in 1234 by Yuwen Mouzhao. Researches on Manchu Origins contained a list of corrections of transcribed Jurchen language words found in the History of Jin in Chapter 135 – 金史/卷135, using the Manchu language to correct them, in Chapter 18 – 滿洲源流考/卷18. The Jin dynasty referred to the Jurchen language with the term Guoyu (\\"National language\\"), which was also used by other non-Han dynasties in China to refer to their languages, like the Manchu language during the Qing dynasty, the Mongolian language during the Yuan dynasty, the Khitan language during the Liao dynasty, and the Xianbei language during the Northern Wei. ==Writing Jurchen names in English== Due to the scarcity of surviving Jurchen-language inscriptions, the overwhelming majority of primary documentary sources on the Jurchen people available to modern scholars are in Chinese.Denis Sinor, The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia. Published by Cambridge University Press, 1990. . Partial text on Google Books]. Page 422. Therefore, when names of Jurchens, or Jurchen terms, are written in English, the same writing convention is usually followed as for Chinese words, that is, the English spelling is simply the Romanization (Pinyin or Wade–Giles, as the case may be) of the Modern Standard Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese characters that were used to render the Jurchen name or word. This standard presentation does not attempt to reconstruct the original Jurchen pronunciation of the word, or even the 12th-century Chinese pronunciation of the Chinese characters (even though more-or-less hypothetical Middle Chinese pronunciation of Chinese characters can be looked up in specialized dictionaries and databases,Database query to Chinese characters. StarLing database server. Retrieved July 22nd, 2009. and reconstructing pronunciation of some Jurchen words is attempted by some authors as well.See e.g. Kane (1989).) Thus, for example, the Jurchen name of the first Jin emperor is written in Chinese as , and appears in English scholarship as Wanyan Aguda (using Pinyin) or Wan-yen A-ku-ta (using the Wade–Giles system). ==References== ==Bibliography== * Herbert Franke, Denis Twitchett, Alien Regimes and Border States, 907–1368.

He was a founding member of the Progressive Party in Colorado in 1912. ==Early life and education== Edward Prentiss Costigan was born near Beulahville in King William County, Virginia on July 1, 1874. His parents were George and Emilie (Sigur) Costigan. In 1877, his parents moved to Lake City, Colorado and the following year settled in Ouray. After five years in Ouray, his father was appointed judge of the newly-formed San Miguel County, Colorado by Governor James Benton Grant. He was elected the judge of Telluride two times. Both of his parents had an interest in mining and were owners of the Belmont mine and in mining in Mono County, California. The family resided in Denver, where his mother was a prominent member of the Denver Women's Club. Costigan attended Denver public schools, including East Denver High School. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in Salt Lake City in 1897. He graduated from Harvard University in 1899. His brother, George Purcell Costigan, Jr. was a lawyer, professor, dean, and author. ==Career== The following year, he moved to Denver, Colorado and practiced law. In 1902, he was declared the winner in the election as state representative, but a contest prevented his assuming his seat at the House of Representatives during the session. He began a fight for honest elections, which lasted over a decade. In 1906, he became a lawyer for the Honest Election League as well as the Law Enforcement League, the latter position he held for two years. He fought for a local option law as legal advisor, which was sustained in the Colorado Supreme Court. Costigan was chairman of the Dry Denver Committee in 1910 and was the president of the Civil Service Reform Association of Denver. During this period, he ran his law practice. He litigated freight rate cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission, representing Arizona commercial organizations and the Denver Chamber of Commerce. He was an attorney for the United Mine Workers of America in 1914 during a congressional investigation into the Colorado coal strike. There were several murder cases that occurred during the strike and Costigan secured acquittals for a number of defendants. Initially a Republican, in 1912 he was a founding member of the Progressive Party in Colorado. He then unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1912 and 1914. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Costigan as a member of the United States Tariff Commission in 1917, a position he held until March 1928, when he began practicing law again. He was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in 1930. Oscar L. Chapman managed his campaign. He served from March 4, 1931 to January 3, 1937. ===Jones–Costigan amendment to the Sugar Act=== In 1934 he co- sponsored the Jones–Costigan amendment to the Sugar Act, protecting the U.S. sugar industry, including sugar from Colorado beets. It was a cause of deep interest to Costigan and his wife. It reformed the sugar industry, prohibited the hiring of workers under 14, and set a maximum eight-hour work day for those 14 to 16. Mabel, a member of the National Child Labor Committee advisory council, was particularly concerned about the practice of employing children to work in sugar beet fields. === Costigan–Wagner Bill === Costigan and New York Democratic Senator Robert F. Wagner sponsored a federal anti-lynching law in 1934. In 1935, Senate leaders tried to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to support the Costigan–Wagner Bill. Roosevelt was concerned about a provision of the bill that called for the punishment of sheriffs who failed to protect their prisoners from lynch mobs. He believed that he would lose the support of the white voters in the South by approving it and lose the 1936 presidential election. The Costigan–Wagner Bill received support from many members of Congress but the Southern bloc managed to defeat it in the Senate. The national debate that took place over the issue again brought renewed attention to the crime of lynching. By the mid-1930s, the rate of the crime had finally dropped to mostly below 20 annually. ==Personal life== Mabel Cory Costigan, Representative Women of Colorado, 1914 He married a fellow high school classmate, Mabel Cory on June 12, 1903. He was class president and she was class secretary. She was involved in church, educational, and community affairs. She was an expert on Sunday school primary work and was a lecturer and story-teller. Mabel was the president of the Woman's Club of Denver and chairwoman of the industrial committee of the Colorado State Federation of Women’s Clubs. She campaigned for child labor law, particularly interested in prohibiting the practice of using children in sugar beet fields. Mabel was a member of the National Child Labor Committee advisory council. She was also interested in the plight of foreign-born individuals in labor practices. After leaving Congress, he retired from professional and political life. He died on January 17, 1939 and was buried at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == * Category:1874 births Category:1939 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:American anti-lynching activists Category:Burials at Fairmount Cemetery (Denver, Colorado) Category:Colorado Democrats Category:Colorado lawyers Category:Colorado Progressives (1912) Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:People from King William County, Virginia Category:Politicians from Denver Category:Harvard University alumni Category:United States senators from Colorado ","title":"Edward P.

He was the brother of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie and co-founder of the Edgar Thomson Steel Works (a steel manufacturing company). ==Early life== Birthplace of Thomas Carnegie in Dunfermline, Scotland. He was born in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, on October 2, 1843.Sources differ substantially on whether Thomas Carnegie was born in 1843 or 1844. A footnote by the editors of Andrew Carnegie's book The Gospel of Wealth lists the date as 1843. Other sources agree. See: Carnegie, 1962, p. 37 fn. 1; Burlingame, 1992, p. 31; \\"Andrew Carnegie,\\" in Encyclopedia Americana, 1966, p. 633; Warren, 2000, p. 391; \\"Carnegie, Andrew,\\" in Appletons' Cyclopaedia of American Biography, 1887, p. 529. However, a number of authoritative sources place his date of birth in 1844. See: Swank, 1892, p. 417; Boardman, 1979, p. 88; Dilsaver, 2004, p. 37; Seabrook, 2004, p. 96. This article uses the date given in Andrew Carnegie's book. His parents were Will and Margaret Carnegie, and he had a brother, Andrew, who was eight years older.Seabrook, 2004, pp. 96-97. A sister, Ann, had been born in 1840 but died in infancy.Tedlow, 2001, p. 26. His first cousin was future industrialist George Lauder. His father was a master weaver, and his mother sold food in the home and sewed soles on leather boots to help provide income. Left destitute by automation (which threw his father, a hand weaver, out of work), the family emigrated to the United States in 1848 and settled in \\"Slabtown\\"—an immigrant neighborhood in Allegheny City, at the time a distinct and fast-growing city on the north side of the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers across from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Seabrook, 2004, pp. 98-99; Tedlow, 2001, pp. 25-26. The family rented rooms from a relative who owned a house at 336 Rebecca Street.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 64. (The street is gone, replaced by Three Rivers Stadium football stadium.)Nasaw, 2006, p. 30. Allegheny City was an unpleasant place to live. It had no municipal water system until 1848, no natural gas lines until 1853, and no sewer system, and wild hogs roamed the streets attacking children.Nasaw, 2006, p. 31. There, Thomas attended local public school.Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 69-70; Nasaw, 2006, p. 59. As a boy, Thomas Carnegie was \\"the beautiful white-haired child with lustrous black eyes, who everywhere attracted attention\\".Tedlow, 2001, p. 33. He was generally considered well-mannered but reserved,Seabrook, 2004, p. 99. and often went into a quiet room during social gatherings.Nasaw, 2006, p. 139. He was also noted for his quick and wry sense of humor.Bridge, 1903, p. 44. And while some, such as Andrew Carnegie biographer Joseph Frazier Wall have concluded that Margaret Carnegie secretly favored Thomas, others such as Richard S. Tedlow disagree and conclude that Thomas was largely isolated and lonely within the extended Carnegie family and their large coterie of friends.Tedlow, 2001, pp. 33-34. It is well documented that Andrew and Thomas did not have the same group of friends, and that Thomas' group was smaller.Bridge, 1903, p. 15. In time, Thomas Carnegie became a lifelong heavy drinker.Nasaw, 2006, p. 286; Tedlow, 2001, p. 34.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 89. ==Career== Thomas Carnegie, age 12, with his older brother, Andrew. His older brother Andrew made a good deal of money from stock investing, and in 1853 purchased their rented home on Rebecca Street.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 69. In 1858, after Andrew had been appointed Thomas Scott's assistant, the Carnegie family sold their Rebecca Street home and bought a large home in Altoona.Nasaw, 2006, p. 64. Andrew was appointed superintendent of the western division of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1859, and he made Thomas (who had quit school) his assistant.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 72. (This was not the end of Thomas' schooling. As an adult, he would later take classes at Duff College.)Skrabec, 2010, p. 30. In 1859, the family moved back to Pittsburgh and resided at 10 Hancock Street (later renamed Eighth Street, and now part of the Downtown Pittsburgh central business district).Nasaw, 2006, p. 66. But the pollution from nearby factories and iron forges proved too much, and after only a few short months on Hancock Street, Andrew purchased a Victorian home for Thomas and their mother in Homewood, then a middle-class village on the edge of Pittsburgh.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 70. Andrew and Thomas rode the train to and from work together, and attended the theater frequently.Nasaw, 2006, p. 67. In 1861, Andrew persuaded Thomas to invest in the Columbia Oil Company, and it paid off handsomely.Seabrook, 2004, pp. 99-100; Bridge, 1903, p. 14; Standiford, 2005, pp. 32-33. That Andrew Carnegie should ask an 18-year-old boy to be a stock investor was not unusual. When Andrew traveled to Scotland with his mother and a friend in 1862, he left Thomas in charge of his numerous business affairs (assets by that time nearing $47,860 or roughly $8.5 million in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars).Nasaw, 2006, pp. 81-82, 85. ===Union Iron Mills=== Thomas' business ventures were often pulled along in the wake of his older brother's interests, and he made his fortune in iron and steel because of Andrew. In 1861, Thomas N. Miller, Henry Phipps (the son of the shoemaker Margaret Carnegie did home work for), Anthony Kloman, and Andrew Kloman organized the Iron City Forge in Pittsburgh to take advantage of the booming need for iron products during the American Civil War.Bridge, 1903, pp. 5-8.Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 77-78. Miller subsequently bought out Anton Kloman's share.Bridge, 1903, pp. 10-11.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 78.Nasaw, 2006, p. 87. Phipps and Miller later learned that Andrew Kloman had sold a one-ninth share in the business to a local man who subsequently died during the war, and Miller bought his share (raising his ownership in the business to four-ninths).Bridge, 1903, p. 11-12. Kloman, Miller, and Phipps were soon at odds over these transactions and one another's refusal to sell out to the others, and they sought Andrew Carnegie's assistance in resolving the dispute.Bridge, 1903, p. 12. On September 1, 1863, Carnegie drew up new incorporation papers which made Miller a \\"special partner\\" in the firm and which also made Thomas Carnegie a partner in the business.Bridge, 1903, p. 16-17. The money for Thomas' investment came from Andrew.Bridge, 1903, p. 17. A clause in the contract permitted Kloman and Phipps to oust Miller and make him a silent partner, which they quickly did. The same clause, however, gave Thomas Carnegie the right to purchase the extra one-ninth share Miller had obtained, and Andrew Carnegie immediately financed this purchase. When Miller, one of Andrew's closest friends, protested, Andrew induced Thomas to plead with him to acquiesce lest Andrew's reputation as a fair dealer suffer.Bridge, 1903, p. 19. Miller did so. Thomas Carnegie at age 19. Meanwhile, Miller established a rival firm, the Cyclops Iron Company, with Andrew Carnegie as an investor.Bridge, 1903, p. 21; Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 78-79. The Cyclops firm opened in October 1864. Thomas, however, was deeply concerned that the Cyclops company would harm his own interests in Iron City Forge, and successfully prevailed on Andrew to merge the two firms.Bridge, 1903, p. 21-23. (It may also be true that Andrew always intended to merge the two firms in order to gain control of both, and used Thomas for this purpose.)Nasaw, 2006, p. 88. Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an additional payment of $50,000 (a very large sum at the time).Bridge, 1903, p. 23. On May 1, 1865, the new Union Iron Mills Company was formed.Derbyshire, 2008, pp. 78-79. Thomas was to \\"help out\\" as needed, and appointed vice president of the firm.Bridge, 1903, p. 25. While Andrew and Miller spent the better part of the next year touring Europe, Thomas flourished at the Union Iron Mills. The company struggled financially as the end of the Civil War led to sharp drops in the need for iron products, but Thomas proved to be a warm and friendly executive where his brother was cold and austere.Bridge, 1903, p. 26. Thomas' ability to make friends allowed the firm to receive numerous contracts and even infusions of capital when needed, and it is unlikely the company would have survived without him. Andrew wrote to Thomas extensively from Europe, constantly criticizing his business decisions, providing him with micromanaging instructions, and generally demeaning him.Dilsaver, 2004, p. 37.Nasaw, 2006, pp. 95-98. From Europe, Andrew also badgered Thomas to make improvements to their home in America, and decided to call the rapidly expanding mansion \\"Fairfield.\\"Nasaw, 2006, p. 93. Thomas' judgement proved to be more prescient than Andrew's when, in July 1865, Andrew became fascinated with the \\"Dodd process,\\" a new English method of welding steel facing to iron railroad rails and, despite Thomas' misgivings, he purchased the American patent for the process.Nasaw, 2006, p. 96-97. The process proved unworkable, and although he made additional investments in retooling the mill, the rails produced by the new process were just as brittle and breakable as the those formerly manufactured.Nasaw, 2006, pp. 100-102. Thomas advised him to conserve his money, but Andrew purchased yet another steel welding patent to try to fix the process. That, too, failed and soon Carnegie's steel-welding business was bankrupt. Thomas correctly foresaw that Andrew too easily believed his judgment was infallible, and soon a coal mining process Andrew had purchased also led to significant financial losses.Nasaw, 2006, p. 102. Meanwhile, Thomas began courting Lucy Coleman, daughter of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman.Bridge, 1903, p. 27. Coleman provided Thomas with critical advice on how to improve the Union Iron Mills, and inside information on the coming railroad building boom. Another critical business relationship was with Piper & Shiffler (later known as the Keystone Bridge Company), an iron bridge building firm invested in by Andrew in 1862.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 77. Andrew diverted much of Piper & Shiffler's contracts to the Union Iron Mills, further bolstering the company's profits.Nasaw, 2006, pp. 102-103. Thomas often tried to rein in some of his brother's excesses, but to no avail. For example, in 1866 Andrew proposed purchasing a pipe works adjacent to the old Cyclops Iron Works. Thomas opposed the purchase, arguing that the time for expansion was not ripe and that the pipe works used a kind of iron which the Union Iron Mills did not produce.Bridge, 1903, pp. 28-29. The pipe works turned out to be a white elephant, but they burned down shortly thereafter (saving the firm from further losses).Bridge, 1903, p. 29. ===The Lucy Furnace and Thomson Works=== Thomas Carnegie played a critical role in the expansion of the Carnegie Bros. & Co. company into the production of pig iron. Iron ore was usually smelted into pig iron first, a brittle but refined product (often cast in ingots) which was usually sold to other companies and turned into wrought iron or steel. Several investors in the Union Iron Mills wished to invest in companies producing pig iron, but William Coleman advised against it and advocated building a wholly owned modern furnace under the company's control.Bridge, 1903, p. 55. A division of the Union Iron Mills (named the Isabella Furnace Company) was organized on December 1, 1870, and the company's first blast furnace (named the \\"Lucy furnace\\" after Thomas' wife) was constructed on 51st Street in Pittsburgh.Standiford, 2005, p. 84. Most of the investors who joined the Isabella Furnace Company were Thomas' friends, not Andrew's.Skrabec, 2010, p. 97. Thomas Carnegie supervised the operation of the Lucy furnace,Bridge, 1903, p. 69. and he was almost alone in contributing to its business success.Nasaw, 2006, p. 147. The Lucy furnace was enormous— high with a bosh (the widest part of the furnace and the hottest due to its proximity to the hearth)—and was producing a record-shattering a day by 1872.Bridge, 1903, p. 54, 58. A second Lucy furnace was built in 1877.Bridge, 1903, p. 63. In 1881, a two-thirds share in the company was sold to Wilson, Walker & Co. and James R. Wilson relieved Thomas Carnegie and John Phipps of their duties overseeing the operation of the furnaces. Thomas Carnegie's experience in running the Lucy furnaces led him to co-found the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. In early 1871, William Coleman became interested in the new Bessemer process steel-making furnaces, and he traveled throughout Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania to view these new works.Bridge, 1903, p. 72-73; Nasaw, 2006, p. 142. Coleman invited Thomas Carnegie to join him in building the new steel works, and together they purchased of land about east of Pittsburgh known as Braddock's Field (a historic battlefield where French and Indian forces from Fort Duquesne defeated British General Edward Braddock on July 5, 1755, in the Battle of the Monongahela).Bridge, 1903, p. 73; Seabrook, 2004, p. 102. (Thomas borrowed the money for his investment from his brother.)Skrabec, 2010, p. 93. Coleman and Carnegie lived near one another in Homewood and went to work together on the streetcar, and it was during these daily commutes that the men worked on their plans for the new steel works.Bridge, 1903, p. 73-74; Skrabec, 2010, p. 103. Although Thomas asked Andrew to invest in the new mill, Andrew refused (considering it too risky a venture).Bridge, 1903, p. 74. Thomas then prevailed upon David McCandless, a wealthy Pittsburgh merchant and vice president of the Exchange National Bank.Bridge, 1903, p. 74-75. McCandless agreed, and brought in William P. Shinn (who would, 11 years later, be awarded the Norman Medal, the top award for civil engineering, in 1883) as treasurer.Bridge, 1903, p. 75. In the spring of 1872, Andrew Carnegie (while on a bond-selling trip) made a survey of Bessemer steel works in Europe and returned to the U.S. highly enthusiastic about the new project.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 83. Andrew subsequently invested $250,000 in the works.Bridge, 1903, p. 75-76. Meanwhile, Coleman, McCandless, Scott, and Thomas Carnegie had purchased a newly platted tract in Pittsburgh, subdivided it, and sold the lots at a significant profit.Bridge, 1903, p. 76. The partners then invested $50,000 each in the steel mill.Nasaw, 2006, p. 143; Seabrook, 2004, pp. 102-103. A new company, Carnegie, McCandless & Co., was formed on January 13, 1873, to build the works. Thomas was on vacation with Andrew and their mother at the upscale resort town of Cresson Springs in September 1873 when they learned of the failure of the investment bank of Jay Cooke & Company, which precipitated the Panic of 1873.Nasaw, 2006, p. 150-151. The Panic created financial difficulties for the company, and it floated bonds to stay alive. J. Edgar Thomson, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a mentor and close friend to many of the partners, bought many of these bonds in late 1873, helping keep the firm afloat.Bridge, 1903, p. 78. The partners dissolved Carnegie, McCandless & Co. to take advantage of a new Pennsylvania law permitting the formation of limited liability companies, and the Edgar Thomson Steel Company Ltd. was created on October 12, 1874. The company took its name from J. Edgar Thomson, who although not a large investor in the works had a superb reputation as an honest and trustworthy person (an important asset in risky financial times).Standiford, 2005, p. 45; Nasaw, 2006, p. 145. Over the next several years, Thomas Carnegie generally oversaw the Edgar Thomson Steel Company. His success in this endeavor was summed up by a corporate historian this way:Bridge, 1903, p. 111 (misspellings in original). :Mr. T.M. Carnegie's abilities were too numerous and complex to be summed up in a sentence. He was a man of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience. Other historical assessments conclude Thomas had a solid grasp of the steel business and was a respected manager, even if Andrew considered him overly cautious.Standiford, 2005, p. 68. William Abbott, chairman of Carnegie, Phipps, & Co., considered Thomas the better businessman than Andrew, \\"solid, shrewd, farseeing, absolutely honest and dependable.\\"Nasaw, 2006, p. 138. Thomas lacked Andrew's ambition, but \\"was content with a good, prosperous, safe business and cared nothing for expansion. He disapproved of Andrew's skyrocketing tendencies, regarded him as a plunger and a dangerous leader. Tom wanted earnings in the shape of dividends, whereas Andrew insisted on using them for expansion.\\" Although he shied away from publicity, he was a hard worker and well liked by both management and workers. His one flaw was his drinking: He often left work at noon and drank heavily for the rest of the day. Crony capitalism was an important part of American industrialism during this period. Thomas Carnegie, however, was not very adept at it. There is conflicting evidence as to whether he mixed widely in Pittsburgh society, with at least one scholar claiming he didSkrabec, 2010, p. 70. and another that he did not. He was reserved at social gatherings, using his attendance at parties to pick up business gossip and industry buzz. He played cards on a weekly basis with Henry Clay Frick, Philander Knox, Andrew and Richard Mellon, and George Westinghouse.Skrabec, 2010, p. 10. His closest friend was David A. Stewart, a co-partner in the Thomson works, and Stewart readily defended Thomas against the criticisms and jibes of others (particularly Andrew Carnegie).Bridge, 1903, p. 111. Thomas sold half his interest in Edgar Thomson Steel to his older brother in 1876 after disagreement broke out over whether to build another \\"Lucy furnace.\\"Bridge, 1903, p. 119. Thomas Carnegie, however, held no position on the Thomson board of directors, a situation Andrew Carnegie wanted rectified the moment a position on the board became available. This occurred in the summer of 1876, but William P. Shinn (the second-largest stockholder in the company) complained bitterly to Andrew (traveling in Europe) that the seat should have gone to him.Bridge, 1903, p. 122. Nonetheless, Thomas was not only added to the board but made chairman upon Andrew Carnegie's return to the U.S. a few months later.Bridge, 1903, p. 124.Standiford, 2005, p. 51. Shinn eventually had enough, and resigned as manager of the Thomson steel works in September 1879. Thomas replaced Shinn as manager.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 88. Andrew Carnegie decided to stop relying solely on his company's own furnaces for coke, and began seeking to buy the fuel on the open market. Thomas and Henry Phipps had alerted Andrew to the need for a greater and steadier supply for coke for the growing steel works. In 1881, Andrew sent Thomas to meet with Henry Clay Frick, owner of H.C. Frick & Co.—the largest coke producing company in the U.S.Standiford, 2005, p. 52. Thomas' goal was to induce Frick to buy the Carnegie coke ovens. In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there.Standiford, 2005, p. 54. Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City.Standiford, 2005, p. 58-59. By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew.Skrabec, 2010, p. 107. Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C. Frick & Co., Frick took a 50 percent interest in the Monastery coke works, and H.C. Frick & Co. would become the exclusive supplier of coke to Carnegie Bros. & Co. and the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. Thomas was assigned to negotiate the price of coke on an annual basis with Frick, and over the next two years H.C. Frick & Co. made a 23 percent profit on the coke sold.Standiford, 2005, p. 59; Skrabec, 2010, p. 104. By 1885, Andrew Carnegie had purchased enough stock in H.C. Frick & Co. to own 50 percent of the company.Standiford, 2005, p. 60. Frick now attempted to buy into the Carnegie steel companies by selling 12 of the remaining 16 percent of the H.C. Frick which he still owned, but Thomas warned him not to try and to instead seek a position as a manager within the company.Standiford, 2005, p. 63-64. Thomas also played a key role in the consolidation of Andrew's businesses. Thomas had become more involved with the management of Edgar Thomson Steel and less with the Isabella Furnace and Union Iron companies.Nasaw, 2006, p. 209. It was Thomas who suggested to Andrew that the companies be consolidated into a single firm, and that Thomas' stake in the new firm be raised commensurate with his managerial role. His older brother agreed. On April 1, 1888, Andrew Carnegie reorganized his iron and steel businesses into one company, Carnegie Bros. & Co., with Thomas holding 17 percent of the stock.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 89; Skrabec, 2010, p. 106. Included in the reorganization were the Lucy and Isabella furnaces, Union Iron Mills, and Homestead works. ===Dungeness=== Dungeness in 1858, after extensive renovation In 1880, with seven children at Fairfield and the city of Pittsburgh becoming increasingly hazardous to health due to its burgeoning industry, Thomas and Lucy began seeking a summer home along the southern East Coast for their family.Bullard, 2005, p. 181. The previous year, the Carnegies had met reporter Frederick Ober while on vacation in Fernandina Beach, Florida. Ober told them about an island plantation he was writing an article about. In 1880, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine published an article by Ober about Dungeness, a plantation on the barrier island of Cumberland Island on the southern Atlantic coast of the state of Georgia. Although it had suffered an extensive fire in 1866 and was uninhabitable, the mansion had a storied past. The article drew the attention of Lucy Carnegie (who had attended boarding school as a girl in nearby Fernandina), and the Carnegies decided the place would be an ideal summer home.Dilsaver, 2004, p. 38.Seabrook, 2004, p. 90. The mansion's owner was ex-Confederate General William George MacKay Davis, a first cousin of Confederate President Jefferson Davis who bought the plantation from its creditors in 1879.Bullard, 2005, p. 182. Carnegie offered to buy Dungeness on August 25, 1880, for $25,000 but his offer was rejected. But after the death of Gen. Davis' son and grandson at the property, Davis desired to leave the place which had brought him such grief and Carnegie offered and Davis accepted a price of $35,000.Bullard, 2005, p. 183-184. The sale for the property (which included orange and olive groves, gardens, several cottages, and outbuildings) was final on November 17, 1881.Bullard, 2005, p. 185.Barefoot, 2004, p. 31. Over the next four months, the burned-out mansion was demolished and noted Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles designed a massive Queen Anne Style mansion with wraparound verandas, high ceilings, several porches, many turrets, and a high tower.Barefoot, 2004, p. 34. In April 1882, Carnegie and his cousin, Leander Morris, jointly purchased an adjoining property.Bullard, 2005, p. 186. The cornerstone for the new Dungeness was laid on February 26, 1884, and the $285,000, mansion (fully furnished) completed on January 1, 1885.Bullard, 2005, p. 186-187. There was even a landing for Thomas Carnegie's steam-powered yacht, the Missoe.Bullard, 2005, p. 187. The Carnegies visited Dungeness irregularly over the next year, traveling to Georgia in a private railroad car. With the purchase of his Cumberland Island estate, Thomas resolved to retire from business and spend more time in Georgia. The stress of working for his brother had left him exhausted. ===Social life=== Both Andrew and Thomas Carnegie had been members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, a highly exclusive wealthy businessman's club which operated a mountaintop retreat overlooking Lake Conemaugh, one of the largest man-made lakes of the day. Lake Conemaugh was formed by the construction of the South Fork Dam in 1853, but had been drained and abandoned prior to its purchase by the South Fork organization. The club, which formed in 1879, restored the South Fork Dam and refilled the reservoir. Andrew and Thomas built a cottage near the clubhouse, and often stayed there.Skrabec, 2010, p. 112; Nasaw, 2006, p. 149. The South Fork Dam failed on May 31, 1889, resulting in the disastrous Johnstown Flood. ==Personal life== In June 1866, Carnegie married Lucy Ackerman Coleman (1847–1916), the daughter of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman.Bridge, 1903, p. 27. Their marriage was followed by a honeymoon around Europe.Bullard, 2005, p. 180.Seabrook, 2004, p. 101. They had been courting since 1864.Bullard, 2005, pp. 179-180; Seabrook, 2004, p. 100. By 1881, the couple had nine children, including:Seabrook, 2004, p. 104. * William Coleman Carnegie (1867–1944), a sportsman and traveler who did not marry. * Frank Morrison Carnegie (1868–1917) * Andrew Carnegie II (1870–1947), who married Bertha Sherlock (1863–1943). * Margaret Coleman Carnegie (1872–1927), who married Oliver Garrison Ricketson (1864–1943). * Thomas Morrison Carnegie, Jr. (1874–1944), who married Virginia Beggs (1878–1952) * George Lauder Carnegie (1876–1921), who married Margaret Copley Thaw (1877–1942), the daughter of William Thaw and Mary Sibbet Copley. * Florence Nightingale Carnegie (1879–1962), who married Frederick Curtis Perkins (1870–1935). * Coleman Carnegie (1880–1911), who died of pneumonia at age 31. * Nancy Trovillo Carnegie (1881–1954),Seabrook, 2004, p. 104. who married Thomas' coachman, George Hever. The children were tutored at home, although they also attended a private school for a portion of the day.Bullard, 2005, p. 189. In 1867, Andrew moved to New York City, giving \\"Fairfield\\" to Thomas, Lucy, and his mother Margaret.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 81. Margaret moved to New York City to live with her older son in 1870.Nasaw, 2006, p. 117. ===Death=== In late September 1886, Thomas Carnegie fell ill with what he believed to be a cold.Nasaw, 2006, p. 284. He was sick off and on for the next several weeks. On October 16, he left work thinking he was suffering from yet another cold, but died of pneumonia just three days later.Nasaw, 2006, p. 285. His wife and all of his children except Margaret (who was attending a boarding school in New York) were at his bedside when he died.Bullard, 2005, p. 190. For most of his life, Thomas had been a member of the Swedenborgian Church. His funeral, however, was conducted by an Episcopalian, and Carnegie was buried on October 21, 1886, in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.\\"Thomas M. Carnegie's Funeral.\\" New York Times. October 31, 1886. His mother, also quite ill for some time, died on November 10 (never learning of her younger son's death).\\"Mrs. Carnegie Dead,\\" New York Times, November 11, 1886. Thomas' death was a serious blow to Andrew Carnegie's financial interests. Thomas had run most of Andrew's enterprises, and to fill his role Andrew Carnegie turned to Henry Clay Frick as his replacement.Skrabec, 2010, pp. 107-108. Frick later played a critical role in the Homestead Strike and in brokering the deal between Carnegie and J. P. Morgan that created U.S. Steel. Some time before Lucy Coleman Carnegie died in January 1916, Thomas Carnegie's body was disinterred and reburied at the Carnegie family cemetery on Cumberland Island. Although the cemetery is still maintained by the Carnegie family, it is located on land which is now part of the Cumberland Island National Seashore. ===Estate=== Thomas' will named Lucy his sole executrix and legatee. The will asked (but did not require) her to seek the advice of her brother-in-law Andrew and her father (who had already died eight years earlier, in 1878) in disposing of Thomas' business interests. Although Andrew advised her to sell out to him, she refused and retained ownership in businesses which led to rapid rises in her personal wealth over the next several decades.Bullard, 2005, pp. 190-191. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== *\\"Andrew Carnegie.\\" In Encyclopedia Americana.

It was held to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. The election was called on May 10, 1924, and held on June 20, 1924. The new legislature met for the first time on November 3, 1924. The Liberal Party was re-elected to its third term in government, falling just short of a majority in the legislature even though it won less than a third of the popular vote. Two Independent Liberals were also elected. Premier John Oliver lost his own seat in Victoria City, but remained Premier until 1927. The Conservative Party formed the official opposition, while two new parties, the Provincial Party and the Canadian Labour Party won three seats each, and a total of 35% of the vote. ==Campaign== The Provincial Party, which nominated candidates only in 1924, was formed by a group of British Columbia Conservative Party dissidents known as the \\"Committee of 100\\", led and funded by the wealthy General Alexander McRae and political elements from the United Farmers of British Columbia. McRae claimed that the Liberal government of John Oliver and the previous administrations of Conservative Premier William John Bowser, then the opposition leader, were corrupt. Many of his allegations were related to the funding of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway plan to reach Prince George in the Northern interior of the province, which was not achieved until many years later. He claimed that there were kickbacks, patronage and various wrongdoings. His allegations were never proven. The election was bitterly fought with sensational allegations against all three leaders. McRae was not elected. Both Bowser and Oliver lost their seats but Oliver continued to lead his Liberal Party as Premier of a minority government after the election. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular vote - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"1920 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change Liberal align=\\"center\\"John Oliver align=\\"right\\"46 align=\\"right\\"25 align=\\"right\\"23 align=\\"right\\" -8.0% align=\\"right\\"108,323 align=\\"right\\" 31.34% align=\\"right\\" -6.55% Conservative align=\\"center\\"William John Bowser align=\\"right\\"47 align=\\"right\\"15 align=\\"right\\"17 align=\\"right\\" +13.3% align=\\"right\\"101,765 align=\\"right\\" 29.45% align=\\"right\\" -1.75% align=\\"center\\"Alexander Duncan McRae align=\\"right\\"45 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"3 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"83,517 align=\\"right\\" 24.16% align=\\"right\\" * Canadian Labour1 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"15 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"3 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"39,044 align=\\"right\\" 11.30% align=\\"right\\" *  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Liberal align=\\"right\\"5 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"3,549 align=\\"right\\" 1.03% align=\\"right\\" +0.06% 2 align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"4,364 align=\\"right\\"1.26% align=\\"right\\" -2.24%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent align=\\"right\\"3 align=\\"right\\"3 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" -100.0% align=\\"right\\"2,520 align=\\"right\\" 0.73% align=\\"right\\" -9.64%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Conservative align=\\"right\\"? align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"2,046 align=\\"right\\" 0.59% align=\\"right\\" +0.14% align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"478 align=\\"right\\" 0.14% align=\\"right\\" * - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\"168 !align=\\"right\\"47 !align=\\"right\\"48 !align=\\"right\\" +2.1% !align=\\"right\\"345,608 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"10\\"Source: Elections BC - } Notes: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 Not the same as the Canadian Labour Party of B.C. which contested the 1906 and 1909 general elections.

It was the biggest overland flood in 20th-century Canadian history. Problems started after two weeks of constant rain, which severely engorged soils, rivers and reservoirs. The Saguenay region is a geological graben, which increased the effect of the sudden massive rains of July 19, 1996. In two days, rainfall accumulated that was \\"equivalent to the volume of water that tumbles over Niagara Falls in four weeks.\\" Over of water flooded parts of Chicoutimi and La Baie, completely levelling an entire neighbourhood. More than 16,000 people were evacuated. The official death toll was ten, but other sources (notably Canadian GeographicThe Saguenay flood: After the deluge ) cite ten. Estimates reach in damages, a cost made greater by the disaster's occurrence at the height of the tourist season. Post-flood enquiries discovered that the network of dikes and dams protecting the city of Chicoutimi was poorly maintained. In the end, 488 homes were destroyed, 1,230 damaged, and 16,000 people evacuated from the entire area. An additional ten persons died in the mudslides produced by the incredible rain.SOS! Canadian Disasters, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada A small white house (referred to in French as La petite maison blanche, \\"The little white house\\") stood nearly unharmed in Chicoutimi while torrents of water rushed in every side, and it became the symbol of surviving the flood. It was owned Mme Jeanne d'Arc Lavoie-Genest. With its foundation still highly exposed after the flooding, it has been preserved in Saguenay (the city name has changed) as a historical park and museum commemorating the flood.La Petite maison blanche An unexpected effect of the flood was to cover the heavily contaminated sediments at the bottom of the Saguenay and Ha!

Billy Durant also acquired luxury-car maker Locomobile of Bridgeport, Connecticut, at its liquidation sale in 1922; in theory, Locomobile gave him a product that would compete against Cadillac, Rolls Royce, and Pierce-Arrow. Durant Motors had a relationship with the Dort, Frontenac, and DeVaux automobile name badges. The Rugby line was the export name for Durant's Star car line. However, from 1928 to 1931, Durant marketed trucks in the US and Canadian markets under the badge Rugby Trucks. The Princeton, a model aimed at the Packard and Cadillac price points, was planned but never realized; also planned was the Eagle car line, but it never made it off the drafting tables. A 1929 Durant sedan ==Production== Durant co-founded a truck-making subsidiary, Mason Truck, and also acquired numerous ancillary companies to support Durant Motors. In 1927, the Durant line was shut down to retool for a brand-new, modernized car for 1928, re-emerging in 1928 with Durant, Locomobile, and Rugby lines in place, and dropping the Mason Truck and Flint automobile lines and the top-selling Star car in April 1928. In 1929, Locomobile went out of production. Initially, Durant Motors enjoyed success based upon Billy Durant's track record at General Motors, where he assembled independent makes Chevrolet, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. However, when sales failed to meet volumes sufficient to sustain Durant Motors holdings, the firm's financial footing began to slip. As a result, Durant Motors began losing market share and dealers. The final Durant-branded models rolled off the US assembly line in August 1931 at Lansing, but continued in Canada into 1932 under Dominion Motors, which also built the Frontenac. ==Subsequent history== The Lansing, Michigan, Durant plant on Verlinden Avenue opened in 1920. After the demise of Durant, it remained closed until GM purchased it in 1935. It restarted production for GM's Fisher Body Division, later becoming the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac factory. It was finally combined with another Lansing plant to become Lansing Car Assembly. That factory was closed on May 6, 2005. Durant's Flint, Michigan, factory was bought by the Fisher Body Division of General Motors, and built mostly Buick bodies until its 1987 closure. Durant's Oakland, California, plant later became a General Motors parts warehouse. Part of the plant survives as loft apartments and a shopping center. Durant's former plant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, housed one of the first supermarkets in the 1930s, and then was used as a cookie bakery by Burry Biscuits for many years. It was in use as a warehouse when it was destroyed by fire in December 2011. Billy Durant died nearly broke at age 85 in 1947, the same year as Henry Ford, aged 83. ==Production model specifications== *Durant Touring Car ==See also== 1930 Durant sedan *Flint (automobile) *Rugby (automobile) *Star (automobile) *Mason Truck *List of defunct United States automobile manufacturers ==References== ==Further reading== *Tad Burness, 1920–1939 Car Spotters Guide, Motorbooks International ==External links== *Durant Motors Automobile Club Category:Economy of Flint, Michigan Category:Companies based in Lansing, Michigan Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers based in Michigan Category:Defunct companies based in Michigan Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1921 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1931 Category:1921 establishments in Michigan Category:1931 disestablishments in Michigan ","title":"Durant Motors"},{"id":"1424227","text":"The legislature of British Columbia in session, 1921 The 1920 British Columbia general election was the fifteenth general election for the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

Unlike its predecessors under pre-1968 versions of the International Sugar Agreement, it does not have the power to regulate the international sugar trade by price- setting or export quotas but seeks to promote the trade in and consumption of sugar by gathering and publishing information on the sugar market, research into new uses for sugar and related products and as a forum for intergovernmental discussions on sugar. As of June 2017, its membership consisted of 87 countries. ==History== Since 1937, a series of temporary International agreements on Sugar attempted to regulate global demand and supply.

St Abbs is a small fishing village on the southeastern coast of Scotland, United Kingdom within the Coldingham parish of Berwickshire. The village was originally known as Coldingham Shore, the name St Abbs being adopted in the 1890s. The new name was derived from St Abb's Head, a rocky promontory located to the north of the village, itself named after the 7th century saint Æbbe of Coldingham. ==History== St Abbs Lifeboat the Thomas Tunnock is based in St Abbs St Abbs was originally called Coldingham Shore. Prior to any buildings the fishermen who worked their boats from the beach resided at Fisher's Brae in Coldingham. These fishermen had to carry their fishing gear one and a half miles down a path to where their fishing vessels were tied up. The path is now known as the Creel Path; creel is the local name for a lobster pot. The first building in St Abbs was constructed in about the middle of the 18th century followed later by a row of five cottages. This first row of houses was constructed in a traditional Scottish style with a central fire and a wide chimney. The walls were constructed of \\"clat and clay,\\" a framework of wood interlaced with straw and daubed with moist clay. By 1832 it is recorded that the inhabitants of the Shore comprised 16 families who, with 20 others residing in Coldingham, made their living by fishing. In addition to these residents, 30 people proceeded annually to the north for the herring fishing, which provided employment for 14 boats from the village. The village was renamed at the end of the 19th century by the then-laird, Andrew Usher, who played a major role in improving the fishing village and harbour. Usher purchased the Northfield estate on the edge of the village, enlarging and finishing the building of a countryside manor by the coastal shore in 1892. He considered the local public hall inadequate and subsequently funded a new village hall and school, which was constructed in 1887 and is now occupied by the St Abbs visitor centre. Usher also gave funds for the building of the local church in 1892 and the extension of the outer harbour wall in 1890. In November 1907 the Member of Parliament for Berwickshire, Harold Tennant, announced that the Royal National Lifeboat Society had agreed to supply St Abbs with a lifeboat, and that the Board of Trade had also agreed to place life-saving apparatus at St Abbs as soon as possible.The Berwickshire News 29 November 2007, \\"Looking Back\\", p. 13 RMS Mauretania during a speed trial off St Abbs, Scotland, 18 September 1907. The lighthouse and its buildings are still there and appear essentially the same. On 5 September 1914, HMS Pathfinder was sunk off St Abbs Head by the German U-21, the first Royal Navy ship to be sunk by a U-boat. St Abbs was the main subject of the book, Ebb Tide: Adrift on the Waves of Memory With the Fisher Folk of Berwickshire, by Will Wilson. ==Village Today== St Abbs is a popular site for scuba divers. The sea around the village is unusually clear, in contrast to the more silt-laden coastal waters further to the north or south. These clear waters and the spectacular underwater scenery resulted in Britain's first Voluntary Marine Reserve being established at St Abbs. The Marine Reserve was established on 18 August 1984 by David Bellamy. Shore diving to a depth of about 15 metres is possible from the rocks on the outside of the harbour wall. It is common for trainees to do initial sea dives here. The double archway at \\"Cathedral Rock\\" is just 50 metres from the shore.http://www.ukdiving.co.uk/places/coastal/articles/st_abbs.htm Several small, nearby rocky islands, such as \\"Big Green Carr\\", \\"Broad Craig\\" and \\"Little Carr\\" are near to the harbour and can be easily circumnavigated underwater. St Abbs Visitor Centre A new visitor centre was opened in St Abbs in March 2011. The centre is located in the former village hall, which was built in 1897 with funds made available by the whisky tycoon Andrew Usher. St Abbs has its own privately funded and independent Lifeboat Station. The lifeboat station was originally established in 1911 following the sinking of the S.S. Alfred Erlandsen. The station was previously operated by the RNLI but following its closure in 2015, a local fundraising effort saw the station saved through public donations and generous funding from the Tunnock's bakery company. The station was reopened and the new boat launched on 17 September 2016. The village also features in the 2019 superhero film Avengers: Endgame as the location of New Asgard, a town settled by the surviving Asgardians and led by Thor. Following the film’s release, the village saw a surge in tourism and popularity.https://stv.tv/news/entertainment/1437338-scots-fishing- village-s-starring-role-in-avengers-endgame/ More recently, St Abbs has featured as the ‘Isle of Eroda’ in the music video of Harry Styles’ 2019 single, Adore You. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/inside-eroda- fictional-harry-styles-island-baffled-internet/amp/ ==People from St Abbs== * William Dickson FRSE, chemist and educator ==Twinned Towns== Signs have been erected throughout the town declaring that it has been twinned with \\"New Asgard\\", as it was the location of filming in Avengers: Endgame.

It associates scientists and artists who have been elected as its members for their outstanding achievements in the field of sciences and arts. It cultivates, encourages and promotes sciences and arts and, through its activities, contributes to the development of scientific thought and creativity in the arts, particularly by: addressing basic issues of sciences and arts; participating in establishing the policies of research activities and creativity in arts; giving appraisals, proposals and opinions on the position, development and promotion of sciences and arts and on the organisation of research activities and creativity in the arts; organising research work, also in co-operation with universities and other research institutions, particularly in the fields which are important for the awareness of and gaining insight into the natural and cultural heritage of the Slovene nation and for the development of its language and culture; and developing international co-operation in the field of sciences and arts. ==Leadership== The president (currently Peter Štih),\\"O SAZU\\" the two vice-presidents, the secretary general and the secretaries of its various sections are elected for a period of three years with the possibility of one further re-election. SAZU can have a maximum of 60 full and 30 associate members; at present it has 84 full and 10 associate members. It can also have a maximum of 90 corresponding members from scientific institutions abroad; at present it has 85 such members. SAZU is active in different fields of research, as reflected in the corresponding six sections of the Academy: The Section of Historical and Social Sciences has 11 full members, three associate members and 19 corresponding members, and comprises two subsections, Historical Sciences and Social Sciences. The Section of Philological and Literary Sciences has 15 full members, two associate members and 16 corresponding members. The Section of Mathematical, Physical, Chemical and Technical Sciences has 15 full members, four associate members and 17 corresponding members and comprises two subsections, Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Sciences and Technical Sciences. The Section of Natural Sciences has 12 full members, two associate members and eight corresponding members. The Section of Medical Sciences has nine full members, two associate members and 11 corresponding members. And the Section of Arts has 12 full members, six associate members and 14 corresponding members. SAZU has founded 17 important research institutes from the fields of the humanities and natural sciences, each of which functions an autonomous research organisation, yet falls under the overall management of the Academy's Research Centre (ZRC SAZU). SAZU also has several special units, including the Department for International Relations and Scientific Co- ordination is headed by a full member of SAZU and the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU) Library, the third largest library in Slovenia, which regularly exchanges publications with scientific institutions all over the world. ==History== Slovenian scientists entertained the idea of an Academy since the establishment of the University of Ljubljana in 1919. The Scientific Society for Humanistic Sciences was established in 1921. In 1925 the Slovene Society, the National Gallery of Slovenia and Pravnik association drafted the first proposal for the law which would establish the academy. The second draft was completed in 1929 yet the Academy was not established until 11 August 1938. SAZU was established in 1938 and was initially named Academy of Sciences and Arts (AZU). On 23 January 1943, AZU breached the cultural silence. Due to the efforts of Milan Vidmar, the epithet Slovenian was added to its name in 1943 with a decree by Leon Rupnik, the mayor of Ljubljana under the Italian annexation. The renaming was disregarded after the war. In autumn 1945, the National Government of Slovenia led by Boris Kidrič took autonomy from the Academy and again named it Academy of Sciences and Arts. His father, the literary historian France Kidrič was elected its president, and confirmed for the second term in 1948. In 1948, it lost even more autonomy and was renamed to the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts again. The academy lost its members with the new act and 30 days later ceased to exist. In 1949, an amendment to the act was passed that allowed for membership not only of scientists and artists, but also of those the deeds of which had a \\"special significance\\". In this manner, Josip Broz - Tito and Edvard Kardelj became its honorary members. Boris Kidrič, Josip Vidmar and Boris Ziherl were elected members, which significantly influenced the development of the Academy. According to the Soviet scheme of development, the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Chemistry were established in 1946, followed by the Institute of Electrical Economics four years later. Despite this, humanistics, social sciences and classical natural history remained the dominating fields. In 1950, there were ten institutes, one board and one committee, among them the Institute of Slovene language and the Institute of Literatures. In this time, the Academy divided into five classes: a class for historical and social sciences, a class for philological and literary sciences, a class for mathematical-physical and technical sciences, a class for natural history and medicine, and a class for arts. This make its composition similar to the current one. SAZU joined the European Scientific Foundation in 1995. ==See also== * List of members of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts * Anton Melik Geographical Institute * Jožef Stefan Institute * ARNES * University of Ljubljana ==Notes== ==References== == External links == * Official website * Category:Organizations established in 1938 Category:Scientific organizations in Ljubljana Category:National academies of sciences Category:National academies of arts and humanities Academy of Sciences and Arts Academy of Sciences and Arts Academy of Sciences and Arts Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:1938 establishments in Slovenia Category:Scientific organizations established in 1938 Category:Members of the International Council for Science ","title":"Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts"},{"id":"1424239","text":"Americans For Medical Advancement (AFMA) is a not-for-profit, science-based, patient advocacy organization dedicated to improving healthcare through biomedical research. It was founded by Ray Greek, MD and his wife, Jean Greek, DVM. The organization opposes the use of animals as causal analogical models, or predictive models, for human response, and believes that using animals as a basis for the human response to drugs is not a safe method of development. For example, efficacy testing, medical research, and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity) are results from animal- based research that were assumed predictive for humans. Americans for Medical Advancement conducts its experiments through critical thinking and the use of evolutionary biology, complexity science, genetics, and personalized medicine. None of these methods require testing on animals. AFMA hopes to improve policy and decision-making regarding the use of the animal model in the testing of drugs and treatments for the safety of human use. The organization does not oppose the use of animals in other aspects of science, and stresses that it is not an animal rights group. President, Ray Greek MD, says, “There are areas where animals are very useful in science and areas where they are not,” and that the organization “explores the differences between the two.” What sets it apart is that it focuses “on the harm that is done to humans” and that animal protectionists are concerned about the harm done to animals. ==Objectives== Americans for Medical Advancement targets their work to improve healthcare. The way the organization hopes to do so is by developing safer, more efficient techniques to use in labs. Since AFMA believes that animals do not give an accurate reading of how drugs will make a human react, the first step would be eliminating animal testing in the development of drugs and treatments meant for humans. As a result, drug development should be quicker and more affordable. AFMA also wants to see medical research funding directed to more relevant areas of research that are often forgotten and not used. Some examples of scientific fields that AFMA believes are not applied enough when researching and creating drugs include complexity science, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, genetics and personalized medicine. Additional goals that the organization has are to have the requirements for animal testing reevaluated through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and United States Environmental Protection Agency. AFMA also wants influential institutions such as the National Institutes of Health to stop encouraging animal models for research, so that other scientific organizations will steer away from animal testing. == Trans-Species Modeling Theory == The Trans- Species Modeling Theory (TSMT) was written by Ray Greek MD, the president of Americans for Medical Advancement. It states, “while trans-species exploration is possible when perturbations concern lower levels of organization or when studying morphology and function on the gross level, one evolved, complex system will not be of predictive value for another when the perturbation affects higher levels of organization.” In other words, when studying higher level organisms, the predictive value to drugs is not accurate because there are too many differences between their complexities. These differences mean that there are different responses to treatments. Higher level organisms are so complex that there is a variation in responses, even within organisms of the same species, depending on each individual organism’s initial state. Greek wrote the Trans-Species Modeling Theory using modern science and newer information. More commonly than not, the methods that scientist use today are based on findings from scientists from centuries ago. Many of those findings are outdated and no longer valid, but continue to be the basis of regulations for procedures used in scientific labs today. Old findings suggested that there were more similarities than differences between similar mammals, so a monkey, for instance, would be tested for a certain heart condition in humans. Up to date science can now prove that although similar, a monkey's heart differs from a human heart, and therefore would not provide precise data in comparison to a human heart. == References == ==External links== * Category:Healthcare reform advocacy groups in the United States Category:Animal welfare organizations based in the United States ","title":"Americans For Medical Advancement"},{"id":"1424241","text":"A adductor muscle is any muscle that causes adduction.

A Republican, he served as a United States Senator from Maryland from 1951 to 1963. ==Early life and career== Born in Baltimore, Maryland, to John Harvey and Eunice West (née Riddle) Butler, he received his early education at public schools in his native city. He worked as a paperboy and later an employee at a mattress factory. During World War I, he served as a private in 110th Field Artillery (29th Division) of the US Army from 1917 to 1918. After his military service, he returned to Baltimore and attended Johns Hopkins University (1919-1921) before joining his father's real estate business. He studied nights at the University of Maryland School of Law, where he received his law degree in 1926. After his admission to the bar, he joined the Baltimore law firm of Venable, Baetjer & Howard, where he worked until 1950. He served as a member of City Service Commission of Baltimore from 1947 to 1949. ==Political career== In 1950, Butler was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate from Maryland. In the Republican primary, he lost the popular vote to D. John Markey by a margin of 51%-49%, but won the nomination after receiving a larger unit vote count at the state convention. In the general election, he faced four-term Democratic incumbent Millard Tydings. Butler received strong support from Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, whose accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department had been rejected by the Tydings Committee. During the campaign, McCarthy's staff distributed a pamphlet that featured a falsified photograph showing Tydings with Communist leader Earl Browder. Butler eventually defeated Tydings by a margin of 53%-46%. Following the election results, Tydings petitioned the Senate to disqualify Butler due to McCarthy's campaign tactics. The Senate subsequently convened a special subcommittee, which declared that Butler's campaign used \\"despicable methods\\" against Tydings and fined one of his aides $5,000, but refused to expel Butler. Butler admitted to paying the printer of the pamphlet and described the falsified photograph as \\"a product of enthusiastic but ill-advised friends.\\" During his tenure in the Senate, Butler established himself as a staunch conservative. He sponsored the Communist Control Act of 1954, which outlawed the Communist Party and authorized the prosecution of Communist-infiltrated organizations. When the federal courts blocked some prosecutions, Butler submitted a constitutional amendment in 1955 to limit the court's jurisdiction and an omnibus bill in 1958 for the same purpose. He was one of the twenty-two Senators who voted against the censure of Senator McCarthy in 1954. He supported returning offshore oil lands to the states, and voted in favor of the non-interventionist Bricker Amendment. In 1956, Butler was re-elected to a second term after defeating Democrat George P. Mahoney by a margin of 53%-47%. Former Senator Tydings had originally won the Democratic nomination, but later dropped out of the race due to poor health. Butler decided not to seek re-election to a third term in 1962. Butler did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. ==Later life== After retiring from the Senate, Butler returned to Baltimore. At 80, he died from a heart attack in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, as he and his wife were returning from a vacation on St. Simons Island in Georgia. He is buried at Druid Ridge Cemetery in Pikesville. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1897 births Category:1978 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American anti-communists Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:American United Methodists Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Lawyers from Baltimore Category:Maryland Republicans Category:Military personnel from Baltimore Category:Politicians from Baltimore Category:Republican Party United States senators Category:United States Army soldiers Category:United States senators from Maryland Category:University of Maryland, Baltimore alumni ","title":"John Marshall Butler"},{"id":"1424267","text":"SASA may refer to: * Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, a small public high school and middle school for developmentally advanced children in Saginaw, Michigan * Scottish Agricultural Science Agency, formerly an executive agency of the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department * Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the most prominent academic institution in Serbia * Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the national academy of Slovenia * Solvent Accessible Surface Area, a measure of the solvent accessible surface area of a biomolecule * Scouts South Africa, formerly known as the Scout Association of South Africa * South African Speleological Association, a caving organization * Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs, a program in the U.S. Department of Education * Martín Miguel de Güemes International Airport, Argentina (ICAO code: SASA) ","title":"SASA"},{"id":"1424271","text":"Nirmal Kumar Ganguly (born 1941) is an Indian microbiologist specialising in tropical diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diarrhea. == Education == Ganguly is a graduate of R.

The new legislature met for the first time on January 16, 1913. The governing Conservative Party increased its share of the popular vote to almost 60%, and swept all but 3 of the 42 seats in the legislature. Of the remaining three, one (Harold Ernest Forster in Columbia) was formally listed as an Independent but was a Conservative who had missed the filing date. He campaigned and sat in full support of the McBride government. The Liberal Party's share of the vote fell from one-third to one- quarter, and it lost both of its seats in the legislature. The remaining two seats were won by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the coal-mining ridings of Nanaimo City and Newcastle. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Party !rowspan=\\"2\\"Party leader !rowspan=\\"2\\"# of candidates !colspan=\\"3\\"Seats !colspan=\\"3\\"Popular vote - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"1909 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change Conservative 1 align=\\"center\\"Richard McBride align=\\"right\\"42 align=\\"right\\"38 align=\\"right\\"39 align=\\"right\\" +2.6% align=\\"right\\"50,423 align=\\"right\\" 59.65% align=\\"right\\" +7.32% align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"17 align=\\"right\\" 2 align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"9,366 align=\\"right\\" 11.08% align=\\"right\\" -0.42%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent Conservative align=\\"right\\"7 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"1,163 align=\\"right\\" 1.37% align=\\"right\\" +1.22% align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"1 align=\\"right\\" * align=\\"right\\"621 align=\\"right\\" 0.74% align=\\"right\\" * Liberal align=\\"center\\"Harlan Carey Brewster align=\\"right\\"19 align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" -100% align=\\"right\\"21,443 align=\\"right\\" 25.37% align=\\"right\\" -7.84%  colspan=\\"2\\"Independent align=\\"right\\"2 align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\"- align=\\"right\\" - align=\\"right\\"1,513 align=\\"right\\" 1.79% align=\\"right\\" -0.80% - colspan=\\"3\\"Total !align=\\"right\\"88 !align=\\"right\\" 42 !align=\\"right\\"42 !align=\\"right\\"- !align=\\"right\\"84,529 !align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"center\\" -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"10\\"Source: Elections BC - } Notes: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. 1 Since nine Conservatives were elected by acclamation, i.e., without any polling of votes, the total votes for the Conservative Party and the overall total as well as the popular vote are somewhat misleading.

Peirce, the presiding U.S. Commissioner to Hawaii; King Kalākaua; Henry W. Severance, the Hawaiian Consul in San Francisco, and John M. Kapena, Governor of Maui. The Treaty of reciprocity between the United States of America and the Hawaiian Kingdom (Hawaiian: Kuʻikahi Pānaʻi Like) was a free trade agreement signed and ratified in 1875 that is generally known as the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. The treaty gave free access to the United States market for sugar and other products grown in the Kingdom of Hawaii starting in September 1876. In return, the US gained lands in the area known as Puu Loa for what became known as the Pearl Harbor naval base. The treaty led to large investment by Americans in sugarcane plantations in Hawaii. ==Background== For decades, the sugar planters in Hawaii had been economically hampered by United States import taxes placed upon their product, and consequently had been attempting negotiations for a free trade agreement. Two previous efforts at reaching an agreement with the United States failed, for many reasons. The planters wanted a treaty, but Hawaiians feared it would lead to annexation by the United States. Sugar refineries in San Francisco lobbied for a clause protecting their interests. The most recent effort before Kalākaua's reign died in the United States Senate. Within a year of Kalākaua election, the treaty would become a reality, although the treaty was not supported by all Hawaiians. There were concerns over American ambitions to annex the islands, with many in the business community willing to cede the exclusive use of Pearl Harbor to the United States in exchange for the treaty. Part of Kalākaua's election platform, as \\"Hawaii for Hawaiians\\", had been to oppose the ceding of any sovereign land. Hawaii legislator Joseph Nāwahī predicted the treaty would be \\"a nation snatching treaty\\". ==Negotiations== At the urging of Hawaii's businessmen and the kingdom's newspapers, Kalākaua agreed to travel to the United States at the head a Reciprocity Commission consisting of sugar planter Henry A. P. Carter of C. Brewer & Co., Hawaii Chief Justice Elisha Hunt Allen, and Minister of Foreign Affairs William Lowthian Green. After several months of negotiations, the treaty was signed on January 30, 1875, ratified by the Kingdom of Hawaii April 17, and ratified by the United States on May 31, without giving away any Hawaiian land. For the US, signers were Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and president Ulysses S. Grant. It allowed certain Hawaiian goods, mainly sugar and rice, to be admitted into the United States tax-free, for a period of 7 years. In return, Hawaii agreed not to levy import taxes on American-produced goods coming into Hawaii. The first shipment of sugar from Hawaii to the United States under the treaty arrived in San Francisco in September 1876 in a ship commanded by Captain William H. Marston. ==Extension== In the United States, the complaints about the treaty had been from southern sugar plantation owners who charged that the treaty favored Hawaiian planters, and sugar refiners who believed San Francisco refiners, in particular that of Claus Spreckels, were given unfair advantage. In Hawaii, the government became concerned that the subsequent United States Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, which lowered sugar tariffs imposed on product imported from all nations, had left them at a disadvantage. Article IV of the reciprocity treaty prevented Hawaii from making reciprocity treaties with other nations. President Chester A. Arthur was in favor of modifying the existing treaty. At the expiration of the treaty's 7 years, it remained in effect on a year-to-year basis. In 1884, HenryA.P.Carter and United States Secretary of State Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen sent a proposal to the United States Senate. After several months of negotiations, an agreement was reached on December 6, 1884, but it would be another 2 years and 11 months before ratification by both parties. Article II of the extension gave exclusive use of Pearl Harbor to the United States. Treaty ratifications were exchanged on December 9, 1887, extending the agreement for an additional 7 years. ==Impact== The most immediate result of the treaty was the boom in new sugar plantations. San Francisco sugar refiner Claus Spreckels became a major investor in Hawaii's sugar industry, initially buying half of the first year's production, and ultimately being the major shareholder in the plantations. Claus and his son John D. Spreckels became part owners of the Waihee plantation on the island of Maui. Within 5 years, it was estimated that he owned one-third of the sugar production in Hawaii. By 1882, the year he exported 24 million tons of raw sugar from the islands, he claimed to have a monopoly on the Hawaiian sugar production. Spreckels became one of Kalākaua's close associates, and by extension, tied in with the king's cabinet minister Walter Murray Gibson. Over the term of Kalākaua's reign, the treaty had a major effect on the kingdom's income. In 1874, Hawaii exported $1,839,620.27 in products. The value of exported products for 1890, the last full year of his reign, was $13,282,729.48, an increase of 722%.

The battle involved a forced 521-mile (839-km) march through the North African desert from Alexandria, Egypt, to the eastern port city of Derna, Libya, which was defended by a much larger force.\\"Naval History and Heritage Command, Battle of Derne\\", April 27, 1805, Selected Naval Documents == Background == In 1804, the former Consul to Tunis, William Eaton (1764–1811), returned to the Mediterranean Sea with the title of Naval Agent to the Barbary States. Eaton had been granted permission from the United States government and third President Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826; served 1801–1809) to back the claim of Hamet Karamanli. Hamet Karamanli was the rightful heir to the throne of Tripoli and had been deposed by his brother Yusuf Karamanli. Yusuf had assassinated his older brother by shooting him in front of his mother. Hamet was out of the country at the time and decided to remain away, in exile. Upon his return to the area, Eaton sought out Hamet Karamanli, who was in exile in Egypt. Upon locating him, Eaton made a proposal to reinstate him on the throne. The exile agreed to Eaton's plan.Lambert, Frank. The Barbary Wars: American Independence in the Atlantic World. Hill and Wang, 2005, p. 150. Commodore Samuel Barron (1765–1810), the new naval commander in the Mediterranean Sea, provided Eaton with naval support from several small warships of the U.S. Navy's Mediterranean squadron: , commanded by Oliver Hazard Perry (1785–1819), , under Samuel Evans (c. 1785–1824), and , captained by Isaac Hull (1773–1843). The three vessels were to provide offshore bombardment support.Lambert, Frank. The Barbary Wars: American Independence in the Atlantic World. Hill and Wang, 2005, p. 152. A small detachment of seven U.S. Marines was given to Consul Eaton commanded by First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon, USMC (1776–1850). Eaton and O'Bannon based their operations at Alexandria, Egypt. With the help of Hamet Karamanli, they recruited about 400 Arab, Turkish and Greek mercenaries.Hickman, John. Early American Wars. Kurose Ross, 1982, p. 82. Eaton became self-appointed general and commander-in-chief of the combined multinational force.Lambert, Frank. The Barbary Wars: American Independence in the Atlantic World. Hill and Wang, 2005, p. 151. Lt Eaton's army route to Derna 8 March – 25 April 1805. On March 8, 1805, Lieutenant Eaton (as self-designated general and commander in chief) began to lead his forces on a trek westward across the Libyan North African desert from Egypt. Their objective was the port city of Derna, capital of the Ottoman Empire province of Cyrenaica (in eastern modern Libya). The mercenary forces were promised supplies and money when they reached the city. During the 50-day trek, Eaton became worried over the strained relationship between the Greek Orthodox–Christian Greeks and the roughly 200 to 300 Muslim Arab and Turkish mercenaries. The expedition's supplies were dwindling with Eaton reporting in 1805 that, \\"Our only provisions [are] a handful of rice and two biscuits a day\\". At one point, some of the Arabs in the expedition made a desperate attempt to raid the supply wagon, but were beaten back by the Marines and a few Greek artilleryman, who used the expedition's lone cannon. Mutiny continuously threatened the success of the expedition on several occasions. Between March 10 and March 18, several Arab camel drivers mutinied before reaching the sanctuary of the Massouah Castle. From March 22 to March 30, several Arab mercenaries under the command of Sheik el Tahib staged mutinies.www.leatherneck.com The Lore of the Corps: Taking the shores of Tripoli required a long land march. Issue Date: March 22, 2004; accessed December 2017. By April 8, when he crossed the border into Libya / Tripoli, Eaton had quelled the Arab mutinies. In late April, his army finally reached the port city of Bomba, on the Gulf of Bomba, some miles up the coast from Derna, where U.S. Navy warships , and Hornet with Commodore Barron and Captain Hull were waiting for him. Eaton received fresh supplies and the money to pay his mercenaries. == The battle == On the morning of April 26, Eaton sent a letter to Mustafa Bey, the governor of Derna, asking for safe passage through the city and additional supplies, though Eaton realized the governor probably would not agree. Mustafa reportedly wrote back, \\"My head or yours!\\". On the morning of April 27, Eaton observed a fort in Derna with eight guns. The brig USS Argus sent a cannon ashore to use in the attack. Captain Hull's ships then opened fire and bombarded Derna's batteries for an hour. Meanwhile, Eaton divided his army into two separate attacking parties. Hamet was to lead the Arab mercenaries southwest to cut the road to Tripoli, then attack the city's left flank and storm the weakly defended governor's palace. Eaton with the rest of the mercenaries and the squad of Marines would attack the harbor fortress. Hull and the ships would fire on the heavily defended port batteries. The attack began at 2:45 p.m., with Lt. O'Bannon and his Marines leading the advance. O'Bannon led his Marines and 50 Greek gunners with the field piece from the Argus, though the gun's effectiveness was lessened after the firing crew carelessly left the ramrod in the barrel and fired it down range. The harbor defenses had been reinforced, and the attackers were temporarily halted. But this had weakened the defenses elsewhere and allowed the Arab mercenaries to ride unopposed into the western section of the city. Eaton's mercenary army was hesitant under the enemy's musket fire, and he realized a charge was the only way to regain the initiative. Leading the charge, he was seriously wounded in the wrist by a musketball. On the Argus, Captain Hull saw the Americans and mercenaries were \\"gaining ground very fast though a heavy fire of Musquetry [sic] was constantly kept upon them.\\" The ships ceased fire to allow the charge to continue. Eaton would report that O'Bannon with his Marines and Greeks \\"pass'd through a shower of Musketry from the Walls of houses, took possession of the Battery\\". The defenders fled in haste, leaving their cannons loaded and ready to fire. O'Bannon raised the American flag over the battery (the unique 15 stars - 15 stripes emblem used 1795-1818, later made famous in the War of 1812 as the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\"), and Eaton turned the captured guns on the city. Hamet's force had seized the governor's palace and secured the western part of the city. Many of the defenders of the harbor fortress fled through the town and ran into Hamet's force. By 4:00 p.m. the entire city had fallen, and for the first time in history, an American flag flew over fortifications on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean. According to Tucker, casualties during the fighting for the Americans were two killed and three wounded, while those among the Christian / Greek mercenaries were nine killed or wounded. Muslim Turkish / Arab mercenary casualties are unknown, as are those of the defenders. Yusuf in Tripoli to the west was aware of the attack on Derna and had sent reinforcements to the city. By the time this force arrived, however, the city had fallen. His men dug in and prepared to recapture the city. Eaton fortified his new position, while Hamet took up residence in the governor's palace and had his Arabs patrolling the outer areas of the city. Yusuf's men dug in south of the city and waited. On May 13, they attacked the city and drove Hamet's Arabs back, almost recapturing the governor's palace. USS Argus and Eaton's captured batteries pounded the attackers, who finally fled under heavy fire. Nightfall found both sides back in their original positions. Skirmishes and several other minor attempts were made on the city in the following weeks, but the city remained in American control. From Derna, Eaton now planned to march across the desert and attack Tripoli from the land. During his march he was informed of the treaty signed on June 10, 1805, between American emissary Tobias Lear from the U.S. Department of State and Yusuf Karamanli. In the middle of his trek Eaton was ordered to return to Egypt with Hamet. == Aftermath == The Battle of Derna was the first land battle of the United States on foreign soil, after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). It was the decisive action of the First Barbary War (1801-1805), although Eaton was furious over what he called a \\"sell-out\\" between State Department diplomat Tobias Lear and the bey. Hamet returned to Egypt and the mercenaries were never fully paid. William Eaton returned to the United States as a national hero. Legend holds that O'Bannon was presented a Mameluke sword by Hamet, the Ottoman Empire viceroy. No evidence supports this claim. The first mention of Hamet giving O'Bannon a bejeweled sword seems to be in a lengthy article, \\"Kentucky Officer First to Carry Stars and Stripes to Victory in Foreign Country,\\" by John Presley Cain in the 29 July 1917 edition of the Louisville Courier-Journal. One sword that was purported to be the sword in question turned out to be a late-Victorian era forgery. He was later awarded a sword of honor by his home state of Virginia. A further legend holds that O'Bannon's exploits in North Africa inspired the Marine Corps officers to adopt Mameluke swords, but this is also uncorroborated by any contemporaneous sources. Swords of this style were very popular in Europe and a more likely scenario is that the Marines were imitating the influential military leaders who were wearing them. The attack on Derna was the inspiration for the lyrics of the Marines' Hymn in the line - \\"to the shores of Tripoli\\". The 1950 American film Tripoli starring John Payne, Maureen O'Hara, Howard da Silva is a fictionalized account of the Battle of Derna. == Legacy == The , the that was the US Navy's most decorated destroyer during World War II, was named in honor of U.S. Marine Corps First Lieutenant Presley Neville O'Bannon. In 1850, the American poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote the poem \\"Derne\\" to commemorate this battle. == References == == Bibliography == * * * == Further reading == *Lambert, Frank.

They are similar to tiny radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) and normally provide about one watt of heat each, derived from the decay of a few grams of plutonium-238—although other radioactive isotopes could be used. The heat produced by these RHUs is given off continuously for several decades and, theoretically, for up to a century or more. In spacecraft, RHUs are necessary to heat critical components and subsystems. RHUs also reduce spacecraft complexity by making heater subsystems unnecessary. By having as few heating subsystems as possible, the overall complexity of the spacecraft can be reduced. While both RHUs and RTGs use the decay heat of a radioactive isotope (usually Pu-238), RHUs are generally much smaller as a result of omitting the thermocouples and heat sinks/radiators required to generate electricity from heat. Both RHUs and RTGs feature rugged, heat-resistant casings to safely contain the radioisotope in the event of a launch or re-entry vehicle failure. The total mass of a single RHU (including shielding) is about 40 grams. Similar schemes, such as thermo-ionic generators, have also been used. == Spacecraft use == RHU Photo of a disassembled RHU. RHUs use Pu-238 to generate about 1 watt of heat each. Most lunar and Martian surface probes use RHUs for heat, including many probes that use solar panels rather than RTGs to generate electricity. Examples include the seismometer deployed on the Moon by Apollo 11 in 1969, which contained 1.2 ounces (34 grams) of plutonium-238; Mars Pathfinder; and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. RHUs are especially useful on the Moon because of its lengthy and cold two-week night. Virtually every deep space mission beyond Mars uses both RHUs and RTGs. Solar insolation decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun, so additional heat is needed to keep spacecraft components at nominal operating temperature. Some of this heat is produced electrically because it is easier to control, but electrical heaters are far less efficient than a RHU because RTGs convert only a few percent of their heat to electricity and reject the rest to space. The Cassini–Huygens spacecraft sent to Saturn contained eighty- two of these units (in addition to three main RTGs for power generation). The associated Huygens probe contained thirty-five. The United States Department of Energy has developed the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) primarily for space use. These GPHSes can be used individually or in groups of up to eighteen for component heating and sources for RTGs. Each GPHS contains four iridium-clad Pu-238 fuel pellets, standing 5 cm tall, 10 cm square and weighs 1.44 kg. ==See also== * Nuclear fuel * Radioisotope generator * Stirling radioisotope generator * Radioisotope thermoelectric generator ==References== ==External links== *NASA Radioisotope Power Systems website – RHU page *Radioisotope heater unit fact sheet from NASA's Cassini mission website Category:Nuclear power in space Category:Nuclear technology Category:Heaters ","title":"Radioisotope heater unit"},{"id":"1424305","text":"The 1907 British Columbia general election was the eleventh general election for the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

As a continuation to Syberia, it is a third-person puzzle-solving game. Stylistically identical to the first Syberia, Syberia II improves upon the first game by introducing more realistic character animation. The game includes a recap of the first chapter, so it does not require the player to have experienced the first game. Syberia II achieved global sales of 600,000 units by early 2006. The game was received favorably by critics. == Gameplay == Kate Walker and a Youki Like its predecessor, Syberia II is a third-person, mouse-driven adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the linear storyline to proceed. As a pure graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to become fully immersed in Syberias universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need to save the game. == Plot== The game begins following the events of Syberia with the law firm that American lawyer Kate Walker worked for in New York, calling in a private detective. The firm instructs the detective to locate and find Walker since heading out to oversee a business takeover of an automaton toy factory, who has since abandoned her job, hoping to appease her family in bringing her back home. In the fictional Russian town of Romansburg, Kate provides assistance for eccentric inventor Hans Voralberg, who seeks to find living prehistoric mammoths, and his automaton train engineer Oscar, by prepping his specially crafted clockwork train with coal. Shortly after completing this, Hans falls ill, forcing Kate to seek treatment for him at a nearby monastery perched on a clifftop. When she learns that the patriarch believes he cannot be cured and decides he should be given spiritual salvation, Kate opts to find a cure for Hans, learning about a friend of his who uncovered information on Youkol medicine. Finding his notebook hidden in the monastery, Kate recreates the medicine and uses it to treat Hans, before being forced to create an escape route for the pair when the patriarch refuses to let them leave. Returning to Romansburg, Kate agrees to take a mechanical part to a local tavern and repair an automaton device he created there for its owner. Upon completing the task, Kate hears the train leaving the station, and learns that two locals, brothers Ivan and Igor, hijacked with the intention of reaching the fabled island of Syberia (inspired by the real-life location of Wrangel Island in Siberia, the last place on earth where mammoths survived), so as to profit from harvesting mammoth ivory. Forced to pursue them, Kate makes use of a railroad gangcar, used for maintenance, which she powers with a friendly Youki - an animal that is part seal, part bear, with dog-like traits. Kate manages to catch up with the train, only to see that the two men abandoned it after it got stuck at a collapsed bridge, and fled by snowmobile with Hans. Disconnecting the passenger car from the locomotive, Kate, after restoring Oscar to full functions, continues pursuing them. The pair eventually track the thieves to a large statue in front of the railroad tracks. Kate discovers from Igor, who is having second thoughts and wants to return home, that Hans disappeared shortly after the brothers arrived. Confronting Ivan over her friend's location at the base of the statue, Kate is quickly trapped by him on the belief she intends to steal his ivory. Just before he is about to kill her, the ice beneath the statue they are standing on cracks and breaks up, sending Kate plunging underground. Upon awaking, she finds herself within a hidden underground Youkol village, in which Hans is being treated by a local shaman who reveals he is on his deathbed. After managing to bring the locomotive into the village, Kate acquires the means for the shaman to transport her into Hans' dreams, which recreate the village of Valadilène, and manages to reach him. Although she convinces him to wake up, she finds herself given cryptic words by him before exiting the dream world. When she asks Oscar what these means, the automaton leaves the locomotive to join his creator, whereupon Kate discovers that he was designed with a primitive exo-skeleton/life-support system to provide Hans the means to stay alive and fulfill his dreams. After witnessing Hans being placed within this, Kate learns that to reach Syberia, she must thaw out a Youkol boat within the village, and does so through using the locomotive, discovering Hans designed it for this purpose. Boarding the boat, Kate, Hans and their Youki partner, soon become stuck in an ice floe. When Kate works to free them, the boat is hijacked by Ivan, who intends to leave Kate and continue to Syberia, but finds himself unable to operate the craft. Kate manages to return onboard and forces him off, whereupon he attempts to toss a penguin egg in defiance at her actions, only to anger the penguins guarding their nest and causing them to kill him. Eventually Kate and Hans arrive at Syberia, whereupon they manage to use ancient Youkol horns to summon a herd of mammoths. Hans, delighted to meet them, is gladly allowed on their backs and rides off with them, as Kate waves him a tearful goodbye. Meanwhile, the law firm learn from their private detective that despite his best efforts following her, he calls it quits on his job, claiming she has vanished without a trace. == Development == Syberia II was announced in October 2002, and was initially set for an October 2003 launch date. The game was produced in 13 months using Virtools Dev 3.0 development tools. Benoît Sokal indicated in an interview that at one time the development team was considering to create one single game for the entire Syberia story, but decided not to as it was so large. In September 2003, Syberia II was delayed to the following year. It reached gold status on March 2, 2004, and was released for computers on March 30 in North America. Its Xbox version launched in the region on October 12 of that year. While Syberia II had been released for the PlayStation 2 in European countries by then, this version was rejected for a North American launch by Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA). GameSpot's Tor Thorsen said that SCEA's decision was made \\"due to the adventure genre's lukewarm popularity stateside\\". The company had previously rejected the PlayStation 2 version of Syberia. == Reception== ===Sales=== In Germany, Syberia II placed 28th in Media Control's computer game sales rankings for June 2004. According to Edouard Lussan of Microïds, the game had achieved sales of 215,000 copies in Europe and the United States combined by that month. Another 100,000 units of its computer version had already been sold in Russia. By late 2005, Syberia II was on track to reach 600,000 sales overall, a number it had reached by March 2006. Total worldwide sales of the Syberia series surpassed 1 million units by 2008, and rose to 3 million by 2016, before the release of Syberia 3. ===Reviews and awards=== Review aggregation website Metacritic reported Syberia IIs critical reception as \\"generally favorable\\" for its computer release, but summarized that of its Xbox version as \\"mixed or average\\". Syberia II was a nominee for GameSpot's 2004 \\"Best Adventure Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Myst IV: Revelation. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Syberia II the 55th-best adventure game ever released. == Legacy == While Syberia featured a cliffhanger ending, a common complaint among reviewers is that the ending of Syberia II is either too abrupt or too depressing, depending on their understanding of the final scene. Indeed, the game does not provide any clear explanation about what becomes of Kate after she reaches Syberia with Hans. Benoît Sokal had stated in interviews it was at that time unlikely that Syberia III would be made. On 26 November 2012, Microïds revealed on their Facebook page that Benoît Sokal had officially signed a contract with Anuman to write the story of Syberia III and that official development had started. Additionally the project is to be overseen by Elliot Grassiano, the original founder of Microïds. Sokal left Microïds shortly after the release of Syberia II and founded his own company White Birds Productions to release Paradise, a game that uses a similar style of gameplay as Syberia but is not directly related. A sequel, Syberia III, was released in April 2017. ==See also== *Dreamfall: The Longest Journey *Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Silver Earring *Still Life *The Moment of Silence == References == == External links == * Category:2004 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Microïds games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Syberia Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Inon Zur Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set in Russia Category:Windows games Category:Windows Mobile games Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Syberia II"},{"id":"1424319","text":"Formerly a British colony, British Columbia became a province of Canada on July 20, 1871.

Cupid restrains her from stabbing her enemy. Jerusalem Delivered, also known as The Liberation of Jerusalem ( ; ), is an epic poem by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso, first published in 1581, that tells a largely mythified version of the First Crusade in which Christian knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, battle Muslims in order to take Jerusalem. Tasso began work on the poem in the mid-1560s. Originally, it bore the title Il Goffredo. It was completed in April, 1575 and that summer the poet read his work to Duke Alfonso of Ferrara and Lucrezia, Duchess of Urbino. A pirate edition of 14 cantos from the poem appeared in Venice in 1580. The first complete editions of Gerusalemme liberata were published in Parma and Ferrara in 1581.Caretti pp.lxv and lxix Tasso's choice of subject matter, an actual historic conflict between Christians and Muslims (albeit with fantastical elements added), had a historical grounding and created compositional implications (the narrative subject matter had a fixed endpoint and could not be endlessly spun out in multiple volumes) that are lacking in other Renaissance epics. Like other works of the period that portray conflicts between Christians and Muslims, this subject matter had a topical resonance to readers of the period when the Ottoman Empire was advancing through Eastern Europe. The poem was hugely successful, and sections or moments from the story were used in works in other media all over Europe, especially in the period before the French Revolution and the Romantic movement, which provided alternative stories combining love, violence, and an exotic setting. Rinaldo and Armida in her garden, by François BoucherThe poem is composed of 1,917 stanzas in ottava rima (15,336 hendecasyllabic lines), grouped into twenty cantos of varying length. The work belongs to the Italian Renaissance tradition of the romantic epic poem, and Tasso frequently borrows plot elements and character types directly from Ariosto's Orlando furioso. Tasso's poem also has elements inspired by the classical epics of Homer and Virgil (especially in those sections of their works that tell of sieges and warfare). One of the most characteristic literary devices in Tasso's poem is the emotional conundrum endured by characters torn between their heart and their duty; the depiction of love at odds with martial valour or honor is a central source of lyrical passion in the poem. ==Plot summary== The poem, which in detail bears almost no resemblance to the actual history or cultural setting of the Crusades, tells of the initial disunity and setbacks of the Christians and their ultimate success in taking Jerusalem in 1099. The main historical leaders of the First Crusade feature, but much of the poem is concerned with romantic sub-plots involving entirely fictional characters, except for Tancredi, who is identified with the historical Tancred, Prince of Galilee. The three main female characters begin as Muslims, have romantic entanglements with Christian knights, and are eventually converted to Christianity. They are all women of action: two of them fight in battles, and the third is a sorceress. There are many magical elements, and the Saracens often act as though they were classical pagans. The most famous episodes, and those most often dramatised and painted, include the following: Clorinda attacks Tancredi, one of a series by Paolo Domenico Finoglia Sofronia (in English: Sophronia), a Christian maiden of Jerusalem, accuses herself of a crime in order to avert a general massacre of the Christians by the Muslim king. In an attempt to save her, her lover Olindo accuses himself in turn, and each lover pleads with the authorities in order to save the other. However it is the arrival and intervention of the warrior-maiden Clorinda which saves them (Canto 2). Clorinda joins the Muslims, but the Christian knight Tancredi (in English: Tancred) falls in love with her (Canto 3). During a night battle in which she sets the Christian siege tower on fire, she is mistakenly killed by Tancredi, but she converts to Christianity before dying (Canto 12). The character of Clorinda is inspired in part by Virgil's Camilla and by Bradamante in Ariosto; the circumstances of her birth (a Caucasian girl born to African parents) are modeled on the lead character (Chariclea) from the ancient Greek novel by Heliodorus of Emesa. To prevent the crusaders from cutting timber for siege engines, the Muslim sorcerer Ismen protects the forest with enchantments, which defeat the Christian knights, even Tancredi (Canto 13). Eventually the enchantments are broken by Rinaldo, and the siege engines built (Canto 18).Erminia discovers the wounded Tancred, by Guercino (1619). Another maiden of the region, the Princess Erminia (or \\"Hermine\\") of Antioch, also falls in love with Tancredi and betrays her people to help him, but she grows jealous when she learns that Tancredi loves Clorinda. One night she steals Clorinda's armor and leaves the city, in an attempt to find Tancredi, but she is attacked by Christian soldiers (who mistake her for Clorinda) and she flees into the forest, where she is cared for by a family of shepherds, with an old man who weaves baskets (Cantos 6-7). Later in the poem we find her again in the company of Armida's ladies, but Erminia abandons her Muslim people and goes over to the Christian side. When Tancredi is dangerously wounded in combat, she heals him, cutting off her hair to bind his wounds (Canto 19). The witch Armida (modeled on Circe in Homer and the witch Alcina in Ariosto's epic) enters the Christian camp asking for their aid; her seductions divide the knights against each other and a group leaves with her, only to be transformed into animals by her magic (Canto 5). Armida comes across the sleeping Rinaldo, the greatest of the Christian knights, and abducts him in her chariot (Canto 14). He has the same name as a Carolingian paladin count who is a character in Ariosto's Orlando Furioso [III, 30]; he is the son of Bertoldo and was the reputed founder of the House of Este. She intends to kill him but she falls in love with him instead and takes him away to a magical island where he becomes infatuated with her and forgets the crusade. Ascalon, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo Carlo and Ubaldo, two Christian knights and close companions of Rinaldo, seek out the hidden fortress, brave the dangers that guard it and find Rinaldo and Armida in each other's arms. By giving Rinaldo a mirror of diamond, they force him to see himself in his effeminate and amorous state and to return to the war, leaving Armida heartbroken (Cantos 14-16). Rinaldo is deposited on a shore where he finds a shield and sword, and the \\"Mago d'Ascalona\\" (\\"Wizard of Ascalon\\") shows him a vision of the future in the shield, including the glories of the House of Este (Tasso drops in several prophecies of the time between 1099 and his own at various points). Rinaldo resolves to pursue the crusade with all his might (Canto 17).Clorinda Rescues Olindo and Sophronia by Eugène Delacroix.Armida is grief-stricken and raises an army to kill Rinaldo and fight the Christians, but her champions are all defeated. She attempts to commit suicide, but Rinaldo finds her in time and prevents her. Rinaldo then begs her to convert to Christianity, and Armida, her heart softened, consents (Canto 20). (This sequence echoes a similar storyline in Ariosto: the witch Alcina ensnares the knight Ruggiero, but the spell is broken by a magic ring that the good sorceress Melissa brings him; earlier antecedents include Calypso's attempt to keep Odysseus on her island Ogygia and Morgan le Fay taking Ogier the Dane off to a faraway island.) After the enchantments on the forest are broken, finally the Crusaders breach the walls and take the city, with some Muslims remaining in the Temple Mount. But an Egyptian army is known to be arriving in a few days (Canto 18). When they arrive there is a great battle outside the walls, which the Christians win, completing their quest (Canto 20). ==Reception== Erminia tends to Tancredi's wounds by Alessandro Turchi, c. 1630 The poem was immensely successful throughout Europe and over the next two centuries various sections were frequently adapted as individual storylines for madrigals, operas, plays, ballets and masquerades. For the work's immense popularity as a subject for dramatic settings, see \\"Works based on...\\" below. Certain critics of the period however were less enthusiastic, and Tasso came under much criticism for the magical extravagance and narrative confusion of his poem. Before his death, he rewrote the poem virtually from scratch, under a new title (La Gerusalemme Conquistata, or \\"Jerusalem Conquered\\"). This revised version, however, has found little favor with either audiences or critics. ==In art== Scenes from the poem were often depicted in art, mainly by Italian or French artists in the Baroque period, which began shortly after the poem was published. Most paintings showed the love stories, typically with lovers as the two main figures. Common scenes depicted include several with Rinaldo, some including Armida. These include: Armida sees the sleeping Rinaldo, and draws her sword to kill him, but Cupid restrains her hand; instead she abducts him in her chariot; Carlo and Ubaldo in Armida's garden; the knights find the lovers gazing at each other; Rinaldo abandons her. Also popular were Tancredi baptising the mortally wounded Clorinda and Erminia finding the wounded Tancredi, a moment of high emotion in the poem and perhaps the most often depicted. She is also shown nursing him, cutting off her hair to use as bandages.Hall, James, Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art, pp. 263-4, 296, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, Most depictions until the 19th century use vaguely classical costume (at least for the men) and settings; by then Lord Byron, Sir Walter Scott and other romantic writers had begun to replace Tasso as sources of exotic love stories to adapt into other media. Some use more contemporary armour, but attempts at authentic 11th-century decor are not seen. The scenes almost all take place outdoors, in an idealized pastoral landscape, which can occupy much of the composition, as in the 18th- century fresco cycles. Part of the Palazzo Panciatichi scheme, in fresco Series of works in paint or tapestry decorated some palaces. A set of ten large canvases by Paolo Domenico Finoglia were painted from 1634 on for the Palazzo Acquaviva in Conversano in Apulia, home of the local ruler, where they remain. Scenes from the poem were also depicted in fresco cycles at the Palace of Fontainebleau, by the second School of Fontainebleau in France, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo in the Villa Valmarana (Lisiera) in the Veneto (c. 1757), and in the bedroom of King Ludwig II of Bavaria at Schloss Hohenschwangau. Another set of four oil paintings by Tiepolo were painted c. 1742-45 as part of a decorative scheme, including a ceiling and other panels, for a room in a Venetian palace of the Cornaro family, but are now in the Art Institute of Chicago. They show the story of Rinaldo, with three covering his time with Armida.Art Institute of Chicago database; Christiansen, 134-47 As in many paintings, Rinaldo's companions Carlo and Ubaldo are also shown. Among 18th- century rooms with sets of paintings of the poem that survive intact are two in Florence, at the Palazzo Temple Leader and Palazzo Panciatichi.photos and photos The first illustrated edition was in 1590, in Italian, and others followed. A set of 35 etchings by Antonio Tempesta better reflect the actual balance of the poem, also showing the military parts of the story.Commons Rinaldo and Armida meet in the enchanted forest by Giacinto Gimignani The series of ten large paintings by Finoglio has the following scenes, which may be taken as typical: *The Torture of Olindo and Sofronia *The encounter of Clorinda and Tancredi *The duel between Raimondo di Tolosa and Argante *Baptism and death of Clorinda *Rinaldo and Armida in the enchanted forest *Carlo and Ubaldo urge Rinaldo to fulfill his duty *Armida tries to restrain Rinaldo *Rinaldo abandons the enchanted Island *Erminia discovers the wounded Tancredi *Rinaldo, victorious, puts the enemy into flight ==Influence in English literature== Tancred and Erminia by Nicolas Poussin, 1630s) The fame of Tasso's poem quickly spread throughout the European continent. In England, Sidney, Daniel and Drayton seem to have admired it, and, most importantly, Edmund Spenser described Tasso as an \\"excellente poete\\" and made use of elements from Gerusalemme liberata in The Faerie Queene. The description of Redcrosse's vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem in the First Book owes something to Rinaldo's morning vision in Canto 18 of Gerusalemme. In the twelfth canto of Book Two, Spenser's enchantress Acrasia is partly modelled on Tasso's Armida and the English poet directly imitated two stanzas from the Italian.Compare the \\"Song of the Rose\\" in The Faerie Queene, Book 2, Canto 12, Stanzas 74-5 and Gerusalemme liberata Canto 16, Stanzas 14–15 The portrayal of Satan and the demons in the first two books of Milton's Paradise Lost is also indebted to Tasso's poem. The first attempt to translate Gerusalemme liberata into English was made by Richard Carew, who published his version of the first five cantos as Godfrey of Bulloigne or the recoverie of Hierusalem in 1594. More significant was the complete rendering by Edward Fairfax which appeared in 1600 and has been acclaimed as one of the finest English verse translations. (There is also an eighteenth-century translation by John Hoole, and modern versions by Anthony Esolen and Max Wickert.) Tasso's poem remained popular among educated English readers and was, at least until the end of the 19th century, considered one of the supreme achievements of Western literature. Somewhat eclipsed in the Modernist period, its fame is showing signs of recovering.This section: Roberto Weiss, introduction to the Fairfax translation of Jerusalem Delivered (Centaur Classics, 1962) It seems to have remained in the curriculum, formal or informal, for girls, in times when it was not taught at boys' schools.

She appeared in minor roles in six films between 1965 and 1976, during which time she became acquainted with Groucho Marx and was hired as his secretary. She appeared in the 1972 Woody Allen movie Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask). ==Relationship with Groucho Marx== Fleming's influence and relationship with Marx were controversial. She was initially (and extemporaneously) hired as his secretary, but eventually assumed the role of his manager. Many close to Marx acknowledged that she did much to revive his popularity, by arranging a series of personal appearances and one-man shows culminating in a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall, which was released on a best-selling record album. She also lobbied for the honorary Academy Award Marx received in 1974. Others, including Groucho's son Arthur, charged her with embezzling money and pushing the increasingly frail Marx to the limits of his endurance, largely for her own personal gain. There were also charges of mental and possibly physical abuse. Marx's friend, writer Sidney Sheldon wrote a roman à clef on Fleming's relationship with Marx titled A Stranger in the Mirror, published in 1976. In a 1993 television adaptation, Lori Loughlin performed the role inspired by Fleming. Marx died in August 1977. Litigation over his estate, which extended into the early 1980s, was eventually resolved in favour of Arthur Marx; Fleming was ordered to repay $472,000 to the Marx estate. ==Later life and death== Fleming was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. She was arrested in June, 1990 on suspicion of carrying a concealed loaded firearm, which she brought into the West Hollywood sheriff's office. She spent much of the last decade of her life impoverished, homeless, delusional, and in and out of various psychiatric facilities. Fleming died of suicide in Hollywood on April 15, 2003, at age 61. She is buried in Hornings Mills Cemetery, Horning's Mills, Ontario.Resting Places ==Filmography== * The Legend of Blood Mountain (1965) - Phyllis Stinson * Hercules in New York (1970) * Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Cafe Customer (uncredited) * Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (1972) - The Girl * Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York (1975) - Girl * McCullough's Mountain (1975) - Phyllis Stinson ===Television=== * The Dick Cavett Show (December 16, 1971-1972) - Herself * Adam-12 (Episode: \\"Venice Division\\", 1973) - Suzanne Martin ==Sources== * Stefan Kanfer, Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx (2000), * Miriam Marx Allen, Love, Groucho: Letters from Groucho Marx to his Daughter Miriam (1992), * Arthur Marx, My Life with Groucho (1992) revised from Life With Groucho (1954), * Steve Stoliar, Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House (1996), * Charlotte Chandler, Hello, I Must Be Going (1978), ==References== ==External links== * from the May 9, 1977 issue of People. * an article by Erin Fleming from the July 1983 issue of Movie Star. * 'The Marx Brothers Council Podcast' episode featuring a 1979 interview with Erin Fleming * Category:1941 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Canadian film actresses Category:Canadian television actresses Category:People from Temiskaming Shores Category:Canadian actresses who committed suicide Category:Suicides by firearm in California Category:Actresses from Ontario Category:20th-century Canadian actresses ","title":"Erin Fleming"},{"id":"1424341","text":"Eternal Majesty is a French black metal band.

He was the first director of Brazil's Indian Protection Service or SPI (later FUNAI) and supported the creation of the Xingu National Park. The Brazilian state of Rondônia is named after him. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Cândido Mariano da Silva was born on 5 May 1865 in Mimoso, a small village in Mato Grosso state. His father, Cândido Mariano da Silva, Sr., was of Portuguese, Spanish, and Guaná (an indigenous group) ancestry, and died of smallpox in 1864, prior to Rondon's birth. His mother, Claudina Freitas Evangelista, was descended from the Terena and Bororo indigenous peoples.Thomé, Nilson; Thomé Pollyana. Cyriacolândia - território da família Rondon no Pantanal.

O'Reilly, \\"Rondon: Biography of a Brazilian Republican Army Commander,\\" New York University, 1969 After finishing high school at the age of 16, he taught elementary school for two years, and then joined the Brazilian army. He enrolled in the 3rd Regiment of Horse Artillery in 1881. Among other studies, he studied Mathematics and Physical and Natural Sciences of the Superior School of War. On joining the military, he entered officer's school and graduated in 1888 as a second lieutenant. He was also involved with the Republican coup that overthrew Pedro II, the last Emperor of Brazil. ===As an army engineer=== Rondon at the age of 24, exploring the Amazon basin as an army engineer The republican government was worried about the western region of Brazil, very isolated from the great centers and in border regions. In 1890, he was commissioned as an army engineer with the Telegraphic commission, and helped build the first telegraph line across the state of Mato Grosso. This telegraph line was finally finished in 1895, and afterwards, Rondon started construction on a road that led from Rio de Janeiro (then capital of the republic) to Cuiabá, the capital of Mato Grosso. Until this roadway was complete, the only way between these two cities was by river transport. Also during this time, he married his wife, Francisca (Chiquinha) Xavier. Together, they had 7 children. From 1900 to 1906, Rondon was in charge of laying telegraph line from Brazil to Bolivia and Peru. During this time he opened up new territory, and was in contact with the warlike Bororo of western Brazil. He was so successful in pacifying the Bororo, that he completed the telegraph line with their help. Throughout his life, Rondon laid over 4,000 miles of telegraph line through the jungles of Brazil. Marshall Rondon was honored with the title \\"Patron of the Communications Corps of the Brazilian Army\\", by Decree No. 51,960, of 26 April 1963. ===Later life=== After the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition of 1914, Rondon worked until 1919 mapping the state of Mato Grosso. During this time he discovered some more rivers, and made contact with several indigenous tribes. In 1919, he became chief of the Brazilian Corps of Engineers, and the head of the Telegraphic Commission. In 1924 and 1925, he led army forces against a rebellion in the state of São Paulo. From 1927 to 1930, Rondon was put in charge of surveying all of the borders between Brazil and its neighbors. In 1930, he was interrupted by the Revolution of 1930, and he resigned from his position as head of SPI. During 1934–1938, he was in charge of a Diplomatic Mission, to mediate a dispute between Colombia and Peru over the town of Leticia. In 1939, he resumed his directorship of SPI, and expanded the service to new territories of Brazil. In the 1950s he supported the Villas Boas brothers' campaign, which faced strong opposition from the government and the ranchers of Mato Grosso and led to the establishment of the first Brazilian National Park for indigenous people along the Xingu River in 1961.From the first expedition to the creation of the Park, pib.socioambiental.org On 5 May 1955, the date of his 90th birthday, he was awarded the title of Marshal of the Brazilian Army, granted by the National Congress. In 1957, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Explorers Club of New York. He died in 1958 in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 92. == Telegraph Commission == Cândido Rondon headed up a large-scale military operation to expand telegraph lines into the Brazilian Amazon, this group has also been called “The Rondon Commission.” Rondon was, by this time, a devout follower of positivist beliefs and he believed his purpose was to unite all peoples of Brazil through his work in the commission. He had an unrelenting belief that progress should be made as quickly as possible and that indigenous peoples needed to be incorporated into society as quickly as possible to achieve this. Rondon showed concern as to how these indigenous groups were incorporated into modern society and he made it his mission to “guide” them to a more “civilized” life in what he viewed as a peaceful manner. However, some critics believe that Rondon's concern about indigenous groups and unification was fraudulent. These critics posit that this mission was mainly a military operation with a state focus on seizing and defining borders for defense purposes along with creating new opportunities for colonization and economic expansion. They believe this undermines the view that Rondon was a hero of unification and pacification towards previously uncontacted or independent indigenous tribes. The Rondon Commission was successful in its goal to open up the Amazon to economic development. Many new settlements appeared along the telegraph lines. New settlers desired a piece of this land for farming and ranching, but one side effect was the displacement of indigenous tribes like the Bororo. ==Explorations== As a result of Rondon's competence in constructing telegraph lines, he was put in charge of extending the telegraph line from Mato Grosso to the Amazon. In the course of constructing the line, he charted the Juruena river (an important tributary of the Tapajós river in northern Mato Grosso) and, in addition, he made peaceful contact with the Nambikwara tribe, which had until then killed all Westerners they had come in contact with.Baker, Daniel ed. Explorers and Discoverers of the World. Detroit: Gale Research, 1993 Pg 483 He also (in 1911) visited the ruins of the eighteenth century Real Forte Príncipe da Beira, the greatest historical relic of Rondônia, which had been abandoned in 1889, and was promoted as major of the Corps of Military Engineers, responsible for building the Cuiabá telegraph line to Santo Antonio do Madeira, the first to reach the Amazon region, which was called the \\"Rondon Commission\\". His works developed from 1907 to 1915. At the same time, the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad was being built, which together with the Rondon telegraphic exploration and integration helped to occupy the region of the present state of Rondônia. In May 1909, Rondon went on his longest expedition. He set out from the settlement of Tapirapuã in northern Mato Grosso heading northwest to meet up with the Madeira river, which is a major tributary of the Amazon River. By August, the party had eaten all of its supplies, and had to subsist on what they could hunt and gather from the forest. By the time they reached the Ji-Paraná River, they had no supplies. During their expedition they discovered a large river between the Juruena, and Ji-Paraná river, which Rondon named the River of Doubt. To reach the Madeira, they built canoes, and reached the Madeira on Christmas Day, 1909. When Rondon reached Rio de Janeiro, he was hailed as a hero, because it was believed that he and the expedition had died in the jungle. After the expedition, he became the first director of the Brazilian Government's Indian Protection Agency, or the SPI. In September 1913, Rondon was struck by a poisoned arrow from the Nambikwara Indians. In 1914, with the Rondon Commission, he built 372 km of lines and five more telegraph stations: Pimenta Bueno, President Hermes, Presidente Pena (later Vila de Rondônia and present Ji-Paraná), Jaru and Ariquemes, in the area of the present state of Rondônia. On January 1, 1915, he completed his mission with the inauguration of the telegraph station in Santo Antônio do Madeira. The 52nd meridian west is also a geographical reference for the history of communications in Brazil. Rondon was the second human being to receive in his honor a meridian in his name. He fulfilled missions by opening roads, clearing lands, launching telegraph lines, mapping the land, and establishing cordial relations with the Indians. He maintained contact with several indigenous peoples. ===Expedition with Roosevelt=== From left to right (seated): Father Zahm, Rondon, Kermit, Cherrie, Miller, four Brazilians, Roosevelt, Fiala. Photo taken in 1914. In January 1914, Rondon left with Theodore Roosevelt on the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, whose aims were to explore the River of Doubt. The expedition left the Tapiripuã, and reached the River of Doubt on 27 February 1914. They did not reach the mouth of the river until late April, after the expedition had suffered greatly. During the expedition, the river was renamed the Rio Roosevelt. The Adventure down the River of Doubt was the most difficult of Roosevelt's life. All the men except Rondon suffered from ailments and constant maladies. ==Positivism/Comtism== From 1898 onward Rondon was an orthodox member of the Igreja Positivista do Brasil (Positivist Church of Brazil), which is a Religion of Humanity based in the thought of Auguste Comte. The creed he embraced from it emphasized naturalism, science, and altruism rather than any supernatural forces.Stringing Together a Nation: Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon and the ... By Todd A. Diacon: pgs 83–84 Positivism follows the goal of preventing social unrest by convincing the lower classes to accept the domination of the upper classes in exchange for things such as material benefits, guidance, and general improvement. Comte postulated that there are three stages of social evolution that humankind passes through, and placed special emphasis on scientific thought, industrialization, modernization, and general reform. These characteristics in particular helped it spread to Brazil following the Paraguayan War (1865–1870), when many Brazilians questioned the foundations of their society. Rondon first encountered positivism in 1885 as a student at the Military Academy in Rio de Janeiro, where it was taught as a form of spreading republicanism. He converted and became part of a growing group of Positivist officers and cadets at the academy. Although Brazilian enthusiasm for positivism was already on the decline by 1891, Rondon became a passionate lifelong member of the Orthodox Positivist Church, believing that Brazil, and the world with it, would eventually accept positivism because it was so rational. Positivism ultimately shaped Rondon's outlook on life, his ideas about interracial relations, and his plans for national development. He once told his men that he wanted to create a “political utopia,” and believed that his telegraph line aided in the evolution of humanity due to the large number of tribes he came in first contact with during the project. Unfortunately, Rondon's positivism ultimately led to fights with officials in the more powerful Catholic Church, limiting the influence and impact of his work in the long term. == The Indian Protection Service (SPI) == Rondon was invited to be the founding leader of the Serviço de Proteção ao Índio (SPI), the Indian Protection Service, by the Brazilian Minister of Agriculture Rodolfo Miranda in 1910. On accepting the position, Rondon explained to Miranda the importance of Positivism in his policies with the organization. He believed that, rather than allow Christian missionaries to forcibly assimilate the indigenous peoples, the best method would be to gradually and nonviolently lead them by example into the more civilized world. Rondon and other Positivists argued for the protection of indigenous peoples and the defense of their lands, saying that rather than being racially inferior, they were simply at an earlier stage of Positivist evolution. Rondon led the organization until the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, leaving many of his initial plans to be only in theory. The goal of SPI was to protect the well-being of natives, and Rondon created its motto: “die if need be, never kill.” Reports published as late as 1960 declared that the SPI had “entirely reached its objectives without betraying” this slogan, even claiming that despite “dozens” of SPI team members being murdered by poisoned arrows, they did not kill a single indigenous person. Instead, they supposedly operated using pacification techniques that Rondon developed while the head of the Mato Grosso-Amazon Strategic Communications and Telegraph Commission, utilizing a “flirting” technique to allow native tribes to choose to engage with them before officially taking over.Ribeiro, Darcy (1960). \\"The Social Integrations of Indigenous Populations in Brazil\\". International Labour Review: 328.

The City of San Francisco declared the four-story brick structure a historic landmark in 1974, and the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Inside, exhibits (including a first order Fresnel lighthouse lens and a shipwrecked boat) tell the story of San Francisco's colorful and diverse maritime heritage. The visitor center also contains a theater and a ranger-staffed information desk. ==Maritime Museum== Aquatic Park Bathhouse The maritime museum was until recently housed in a Streamline Moderne (late Art Deco) building that is the centerpiece of the Aquatic Park Historic District, a National Historic Landmark at the foot of Polk Street and a minute's walk from the visitor center and Hyde Street Pier. The building was originally built (starting in 1936) by the WPA as a public bathhouse, and its interior is decorated with fantastic and colorful murals, created primarily by artist and color theoretician Hilaire Hiler. The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III. ==Maritime Research Center== The Maritime Research Center is the premier resource for San Francisco and Pacific Coast maritime history. Originating in 1939, the collections have become the largest maritime collection on the West Coast and the largest museum and research collection in the National Park Service. The collections include more than: * 35,000 published titles comprising over 74,000 items * 500,000 photographs * 7,000 archival and manuscript collections * 150,000 naval architecture and marine engineering drawings * 3,000 maps and charts * 150,000 feet of motion picture film and video * 6,000 historical archaeology artifacts * 2,500 pieces of folk and fine art * 40,000 history objects * 100 small craft * 50,000 pieces of ephemera * 600 oral histories and audio recordings ==Supporting associations== The park is supported by several cooperating associations.

Just north of the village are the remains of the Roman town of Tripontium. The village is also at the northern end of the \\"Great Central Walk\\" the footpath along the trackbed of the old Great Central Main Line. The main industry in the area is gravel extraction, which continues near the A5. Most of the houses in the village are of modern construction and were built to house workers for this industry. The Stag and Pheasant pub in Main St whilst not being the oldest pub in Warwickshire is the oldest building used as a pub in the County. Although the thatched building has a brick facing, probably added in the 17th Century, its core is a massive oak cruck frame of indeterminate age, possibly Saxon. The Townlands Allotments are also of some antiquity being established in 1752 at the time of the enclosures. They are at the end of Little London Lane - one of a number of localities carrying this name in England.

Various parties have been formed over the years in Jersey, but few candidates stand for election affiliated to any political party. All elections in Jersey use the first-past-the-post voting system. In 2008, the voting age was reduced to 16 years. ==National elections== Jersey elects a legislature. From November 2011, the assembly of the States Assembly has 51 elected members: 10 Senators (elected on an island- wide basis), 29 Deputies (elected in single- and multi-seat constituencies) and 12 Connétables (heads of the parishes). The normal term of office for elected States Members is four years, though members elected in October 2011 and October 2014 will serve for shorter periods. From 2018, elections will be held in May every fourth year. The most recent elections were held in 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, October 2011 (when, for the first time, Senators, Deputies and Connétables stood for election on the same day), October 2014 and May 2018. ===Senators=== The office of Senator was created in 1948. In the early years of Senatorial elections since 1948, parish loyalties meant that votes would swing around the candidates, with Saint Helier - the largest and last parish to declare - often deciding the election. Since the 1980s, parish loyalties to local candidates have faded in favour of Islandwide issues and it is usual for the pattern of winning candidates to be clear from the first declarations, with \\"Town\\" voters in St Helier only likely to decide the last-placed candidate. Initially, Senators served terms of nine years but this was reduced to six years in 1966 and to four years in 2011. The number of Senators will be reduced to eight in the October 2014 elections. As part of the transitional arrangements for this new electoral system, the six Senators elected for six-year terms in 2008 did not face election in 2011.Senators Bryan Ian Le Marquand, Alan Breckon, Alan Maclean, Paul Routier, Philip Ozouf Jr and Sarah Ferguson. Up to the 2008 elections, six of the 12 Senatorial seats fell vacant every three years in elections held in October. Deputies had three year terms, with elections held in November. Defeated Senatorial candidates were therefore able to stand in the following Deputorial elections. It was not uncommon for an incumbent Senator denied re-election by the Island electorate to seek a refreshed mandate in their own parish. A number of prospective candidates for Deputy used the preceding Senatorials as a dry-run to either raise their public profile or, in the absence of a strong tie to one particular parish, to see which Deputorial constituency gave them the highest Senatorial vote. There was no uniform date for Connétable elections. To be nominated for Senator, a candidate must secure a nomination paper signed by 10 validly-registered voters, including a proposer and seconder. The proposer and seconder must attend in person the Electoral Assembly (\\"nomination meeting\\") held at the Parish Hall of St Helier, presided over by the Comité des Connétables, and the proposer must read out publicly the nomination form, including the candidate's declaration of criminal convictions (or of no criminal convictions).Public Elections (Jersey) Law 2002 and the Public Elections (Jersey) Regulations 2002. If more candidates are nominated than there are seats available, a poll is declared, to be taken on the date set by the Royal Court. If there are no more candidates nominated after 20 minutes than available seats, then the candidates are declared elected unopposed and no poll is taken. The Royal Court appoints an autorisé for each constituency to oversee the poll (usually, but not exclusively, a Jurat or Crown Officer). Results for each parish on polling day are declared by the autorisé. In the October 2011 elections, four senatorial seats were contested, each voter having a maximum of four unranked votes in a first past the post bloc voting system (multi-member plurality system). In the October 2014 elections, each voter had eight unranked votes for Senator. ===Deputies=== The procedure for nomination for Deputy follows the same pattern as for the Senatorials, except that the nomination paper must be signed by 10 voters, including proposer and seconder, validly registered in the constituency in which they intend standing (for a Senatorial election, the constituency is one all-Island constituency). The proposer and seconder must attend in person the Electoral Assembly (\\"nomination meeting\\") presided by the Constable (or Chef de Police or Procureur du Bien Public) of the respective parish held at the respective parish's parish hall (Public Hall in the case of St. Martin) or other place as may be specified. In the case of parishes divided into more than one electoral district, nominations are accepted at the Electoral Assembly by district, nominations for each district having to last at least 20 minutes. (see articles on individual parishes for electoral districts) In single-member districts, a simple first past the post election is held. In multi-member districts, the system is that of a first past the post bloc election analogous to the Senatorials. ==Past elections== ===By-elections=== For senators: *1999 Jersey by-elections *2003 Jersey by-elections *2004 Jersey by-elections *2010 Jersey by-elections For deputies: *1999 Jersey by-elections *2000 Jersey by- elections *2014 Jersey by-elections ==Local elections== The first local election on the island was a one off event in 1940. The elected Connétable (or \\"Constable\\") heads the administration of each of the twelve parishes. Procureurs du Bien Public and Centeniers are elected under the same rules as Senators, Deputies and Constables. Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers, collectively the Honorary Police are elected by a Parish assembly along with members of the Roads Committee and Roads Inspectors and must take an oath of office before the Royal Court. Other municipal officials are also elected by an Assembly of Electors but are not subject to an oath of office. Changes to the Voting Law meant that all elections for the position of Procureur du Bien Public and Centenier now follow the rule applied to elections to the States of Jersey.Changes to Procureur elections : Retrieved 28 July 2007 Since such elections are generally uncontested the following list details contested elections only.

The right to vote is determined by residency, not citizenship, and therefore citizens of any state may vote in Jersey elections provided they fulfill the other requirements for electoral registration. On 4 July 2007, the States of Jersey voted to reduce voting age to 16. The law was brought into force on 12 March 2008, with effect from 1 April 2008, allowing 16- and 17-year-old voters to register in time for the 2008 elections.16-year-olds able to vote this year, Jersey Evening Post 13 March 2008 Those entitled to vote at elections other than public elections are electors, ratepayers and mandataires.

By the next elections in 1924, suffrage had been extended to Indians and Arabs, with five seats given to the Indian community and one to the Arabs, as well as one seat appointed to represent the majority African population. However, the Indian community demanded equal representation with the Europeans, and when this was not forthcoming, boycotted the elections, with not a single Indian candidate standing. This boycott continued for the 1927 elections, although one Indian candidate did stand. All five Indian seats were filled by election in the 1931 elections, and further elections took place under the same system in 1934, 1938, 1944 and 1948. Prior to the 1952 elections the number of European seats was increased to 14 and the Indian seats to six, with six African members appointed. The same system was used in 1956, but in March 1957 elections were held for eight African seats, the first time the African population had been able to vote. The 1961 elections were the first held under universal suffrage, although 20 of the 65 seats in the expanded Council were reserved for Europeans (10), Indians (8) and Arabs (2). The Kenya African National Union (KANU) emerged as the largest party, winning 19 seats and taking 67.5% of the vote. The electoral system was changed again prior to the 1963 elections, with the creation of a 129-seat House of Representatives and a 38-seat Senate. KANU won a majority in the House of Representatives and the most seats in the Senate, allowing Jomo Kenyatta to become the first Prime Minister, and upon independence the following year, President. Multi-party politics remained in place for a few years after independence; when several KANU MPs left the party to form the Kenya People's Union (KPU) in 1966, a constitutional amendment was passed requiring them to face by-elections. This came to be known as the little general election, in which the KPU received a majority of the vote, but KANU won more than 60% of the seats. Later in the year the Senate was abolished, as it was merged with the House of Representatives to form the National Assembly. The KPU was subsequently banned in 1969 and Kenya became a one-party state. As a result, KANU won every seat in elections in 1969, 1974, 1979, 1983 and 1988, with the elections seeing multiple KANU candidates run against each other. With the wave of democratisation sweeping across Africa in the early 1990s, multi-party politics was reintroduced, together with the direct election of the president. General elections took place in 1992, and saw KANU retain control of the government, with President Daniel arap Moi re- elected with 36% of the vote and KANU winning 100 of the 188 seats in the National Assembly. Moi was re-elected again in 1997 with 40% of the vote, whilst KANU retained its parliamentary majority, taking 107 of the 210 seats. The 2002 elections saw KANU's first defeat; Moi stood down and the KANU candidate Uhuru Kenyatta was defeated by Mwai Kibaki of the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) alliance. NARC also won a majority in the National Assembly. However, the coalition fell apart as a result of the 2005 referendum, and Kibaki's former ally Raila Odinga became his principal opponent in the 2007 elections. Although Kibaki was declared the winner in the presidential contest, opposition parties won a majority of seats in the National Assembly. Accusations of electoral fraud were made, resulting in violence that left around 1,000 dead. The following year the National Accord and Reconciliation Act 2008 was passed and Odinga became the first Prime Minister since 1964. A new constitution was introduced in 2010, and the first elections were held under it in 2013. Running as the Jubilee Alliance candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta defeated Odinga, receiving 50.5% of the vote. Although Kenyatta's National Alliance emerged as the largest party in the re-established Senate, Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement won the most seats in the National Assembly, with 96 of the 349 seats. ==Referendums== Two nationwide referendums have been held in Kenya, both on proposed new constitutions. A 2005 referendum saw the proposed constitution rejected by 58% of voters, whilst a 2010 referendum saw a new constitution approved by 69% of voters. ==Electoral system== The electoral system in Kenya. ===President=== The 2010 constitution provides for a two-round system for presidential elections, the president having previously been elected on a first-past-the-post basis.

He was drafted by the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer but opted to try his fortunes overseas. Russell joined Sogndal of the Norwegian Premier League, where he established himself as one of the best right backs in Norway. This fact was confirmed when Rosenborg BK also from Norway made a move for him in 2004. Russell became a starter at right back in his first season with Rosenborg BK (including two starts for the team in the UEFA Champions League) and helped the team win its 19th league title. Unfortunately he only played in a couple of matches in 2005 due to a knee injury and a change in the coaching staff. In July 2006, Russell moved to Viborg FF of the Danish Superliga. His debut for Viborg FF came in a 3–1 loss at Aalborg BK. In July 2008, Russell ended his Scandinavian sojourn by signing with Real Salt Lake, where coach Jason Kreis was a fellow alumnus of Duke University. On November 23, 2009, Russell scored the game-winning goal of the 2009 MLS Cup in the seventh round of a penalty kick shoot out. The goal gave Real Salt Lake their first MLS championship. On May 29, 2010 he scored his first career goal for Real Salt Lake in a 4–1 victory over the Kansas City Wizards at Rio Tinto Stadium. On November 29, 2011, Russell was traded to D.C.

WDVE (102.5 FM) is a classic rock music-formatted radio station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States at 102.5 MHz. It is often referred to by Pittsburghers as simply \\"DVE.\\" WDVE's studios are located in Green Tree, while its transmitter is located on Pittsburgh's North Side. Since 2006, the station has been the highest-rated radio station in the Pittsburgh market, surpassing longtime market leader KDKA. The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, and (along with WBGG) serves as the flagship radio station of the Pittsburgh Steelers radio network. WDVE is designated a superpower station by the Federal Communications Commission. The station's effective radiated power of 55,000 watts exceeds the maximum limit set by the FCC for a Class B FM radio station. WDVE uses HD Radio and broadcasts a sports format on its HD2 subchannel branded as Steelers Nation Radio. ==History== WDVE's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. The station has aired rock music since 1969, when it was owned by ABC. Previously, it was known as KQV-FM and simulcasted then-sister station KQV. The new programming was a tape service of a freeform rock format entitled \\"Love\\", created by ABC official Allen Shaw designed specifically for airing on the 7 FM stations owned by ABC. Shaw changed the format from the automated \\"Love\\" format to live Freeform Album-Oriented Rock}Album Rock in 1970. The station's current call letters were chosen in December 1970 at the height of the \\"hippie\\" era. \\"WDVE\\" was derived from the word \\"Wonderful Dove\\", the bird of peace. In the fall of 1971, Shaw, along with ABC Radio programming executive Bob Henaberry, replaced the freeform rock programming with the very first AOR format, playing only the best cuts from the best selling rock albums with minimal disc jockey talk. WDVE was the most successful FM radio station in Pittsburgh throughout the 1970s. In early print marketing, the phrase \\"Rock \\"N\\" Stereo! Pure Rock Pittsburgh's WDVE 102 & A 1/2 FM, The Radio Station\\" was set in white text against a black oval background surrounded by vivid rainbow- like colors. Later, the logo was rendered in white and yellow with red accents against a black background, generally using the slogan \\"102.5 WDVE Rocks!\\" Starting in the 1980s, the station started playing the Beat Farmers song Happy Boy every Friday around 3 p.m. at the start of the afternoon drive time shift to signal the end of the work week and the start of the weekend. On Fridays at noon, they air a recording of the band KISS saying; \\"Hey yinz guys! It's FRIDAY!!\\", immediately followed by \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\". Radio personality and WEBN alum Maxwell Slater \\"Max\\" Logan (Ben Bornstein), formerly heard on WMMS, WNCX in Cleveland and now on WLUP-FM in Chicago as host of The Maxwell Show, spent time at WDVE in the mid-1990s. * In addition to its status as flagship station of the Steelers, WDVE served for years as the flagship station of the Pittsburgh Penguins (until 2006 when sister station WXDX-FM became the Penguins' flagship), promoting itself with such oddities as a young Jaromír Jágr reading the morning weather forecast in heavily accented English during his suspension from the NHL. Because of the station having a largely male audience, the station refers to fellow iHeartMedia stations WXDX-FM and WPGB as \\"brother\\" stations as opposed to the more commonly used term \\"sister\\" station, since WXDX-FM also has a predominantly male audience and all three have younger listeners. In recent years, the station's format has gradually drifted towards classic rock, with current releases rarely incorporated into the playlist, though some recent songs such as Ozzy Osbourne's 2007 hit \\"I Don't Wanna Stop\\" are played on the station (Osbourne himself is a fixture on many classic rock stations). Pittsburgh had been without a full-time classic rock station since the flip of WRRK to adult hits, even though iHeartMedia considers the station as a classic rocker; however, since 2016, WDVE has added more newer rock tracks that were not being played on co-owned WXDX, with the station gradually shifting to a more mainstream rock direction. Currently, the station air staff consists of morning show host Randy Baumann, morning News Reader and Saturday morning host Val Porter, morning sportscaster Mike Prisuta, morning show comedian Bill Crawford, mid-day host Michele Michaels, afternoon and weekend host Chad Tyson, evening host Russ “Whip” Rose, and weekend hosts Frank Cindrich and Eric Taylor. To fill out the rest of their schedule, the station uses iHeartMedia’s Premium Choice service, which provides additional weekend and overnight dayparts hosted by air talent from across the country. The station was one of the few iHeartRadio stations not affected by the company’s mass layoffs in January 2020. ==Morning Show== As of January 2012 Randy Baumann and the DVE Morning Show airs on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.. The rest of the morning show team are newsreader Val Porter, sportscaster Mike Prisuta, \\"executive contributor\\" Scott Paulsen,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=319532784757959&id;=100000277769005 and comedian Bill Crawford.http://www.wtae.com/entertainment/30253520/detail.html?fb_ref=story_top&fb;_source=timeline The show features a variety of comedy skits, musical parodies, and music. Prior to hosting solo, Baumann was teamed with Jim Krenn starting in early 2000. Prior to that, Krenn had been on with Scott Paulsen, who along with \\"News Goddess\\" Lauri Githens had hosted the morning show from 1986-1988 (after \\"Little Jimmy\\" Roach and \\"Big Steve\\" Hansen of \\"The DVE Morning Alternative\\" were not offered a new contract after their 1980-1986 stint).http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/music/s_710170.html On January 18, 2010, the morning show returned to the air without Randy Baumann and used the name \\"DVE Morning Show\\" (rather than \\"Jim and Randy and the DVE Morning Show\\"). Randy Baumann's contract had expired at the beginning of 2010 and he returned to the airwaves on February 17, 2010 after contract negotiations had been settled. The show resumed its previous title \\"Jim and Randy and the DVE Morning Show\\". On December 31, 2011, iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) announced that Jim Krenn would no longer be part of the DVE Morning show but is still employed at the station. According to a statement made by Dennis Lamme, President and Market Manager of Clear Channel Media & Entertainment-Pittsburgh, \\"We are currently in discussion with Jim about his role with the station moving forward.\\". They are again using the name \\"DVE Morning Show\\".http://www.dve.com/pages/morningshow.html Krenn's official departure from Clear Channel was announced on January 19, 2012. As of February 23, 2012, WDVE has branded the morning show \\"Randy Baumann and the DVE Morning Show\\".

Until 1917, she was active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany,Clara Zetkin  bpb then she joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and its far-left wing, the Spartacist League; this later became the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which she represented in the Reichstag during the Weimar Republic from 1920 to 1933.Gilbert Badia, Clara Zetkin: Féministe Sans Frontières (Paris: Les Éditions Ouvrières 1993). == Biography == === Background and education === The eldest of three children, Clara Zetkin was born Clara Josephine Eissner in Wiederau, a peasant village in Saxony, now part of the municipality Königshain-Wiederau. Her father, Gottfried Eissner, was a schoolmaster and church organist who was a devout Protestant, while her mother, Josephine Vitale, had French roots, came from a middle-class family from Leipzig, and was highly educated. In 1872 her family moved to Leipzig where she was educated at the Leipzig Teachers’ College for Women. While in school she established contacts with the infant Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD; Social Democratic Party). Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg, 1910 GDR A plaque commemorating where Clara Zetkin once lived in Jena, Germany Because of the ban placed on socialist activity in Germany by Bismarck in 1878, Zetkin left for Zurich in 1882 then went into exile in Paris, where she studied to be a journalist and a translator. During her time in Paris she played an important role in the foundation of the Socialist International group. She also adopted the name of her lover, the Russian-Jewish , a devoted Marxist, with whom she had two sons, Maxim and following two years later Konstantin (known as Kostja). Ossip Zetkin became severely ill in the early period of 1889, passing away only a few months later, in June. Following the loss of her husband, she moved to Stuttgart with her children. Zetkin was married to the artist Georg Friedrich Zundel, eighteen years her junior, from 1899 to 1928.Clara Zetkin biography from the University of Leipzig (in German) === Early engagement in the Social Democratic Party === Clara Zetkin's political career began after being introduced to Ossip Zetkin, who she later married. Within a few months of attending and taking part in socialist meetings, Zetkin became entirely committed to the party, offering a Marxist approach and for the demand of women's liberation. Around the time of 1880, due to the political climate in Germany, Zetkin went into exile in Switzerland and later in France. Upon her return to Germany, nearly a decade later, she became the editor of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) newspaper for women, Die Gleichheit (Equality), a post she occupied for twenty-five years. Having studied to become a teacher, Zetkin developed connections with the women's movement and the labour movement in Germany from 1874. In 1878 she joined the Socialist Workers' Party (Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei, SAP). This party had been founded in 1875 by merging two previous parties: the ADAV formed by Ferdinand Lassalle and the SDAP of August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht. In 1890 its name was changed to its modern version Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the SPD, Zetkin, along with Rosa Luxemburg, her close friend and confidante, was one of the main figures of the far-left wing of the party. In the debate on Revisionism at the turn of the 20th century they jointly attacked the reformist theses of Eduard Bernstein, who had rejected the ideology of a revolutionary change, towards \\"revolutionary socialism\\".Clara Zetkin biography at Fembio.org (in German) === Fight for women's rights === Zetkin was very interested in women's politics, including the fight for equal opportunities and women's suffrage through a socialist means. She helped to develop the social-democratic women's movement in Germany; from 1891 to 1917 she edited the SPD women's newspaper Die Gleichheit (Equality). In 1907 she became the leader of the newly founded \\"Women's Office\\" at the SPD. She also contributed to International Women's Day (IWD). In August 1910, an International Women's Conference was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist Second International in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired in part by American socialists' actions, Zetkin, Käte Duncker and others proposed that \\"a special Women's Day\\" be organized annually, although no date was specified at that conference. Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including suffrage for women. The following year on 19 March 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. However, Zetkin was deeply opposed to the concept of \\"bourgeois feminism,\\" which she claimed was a tool to divide the unity of the working classes. In a speech she delivered to the Second International in 1899 she stated: :The working women, who aspire to social equality, expect nothing for their emancipation from the bourgeois women’s movement, which allegedly fights for the rights of women. That edifice is built on sand and has no real basis. Working women are absolutely convinced that the question of the emancipation of women is not an isolated question which exists in itself, but part of the great social question. They realize perfectly clear that this question can never be solved in contemporary society, but only after a complete social transformation. She viewed the feminist movement as being primarily composed of upper-class and middle-class women who had their own class interests in mind, which were incompatible with the interests of working-class women. Thus, feminism and the socialist fight for women's rights were incompatible. In her mind, socialism was the only way to truly end the oppression of women. One of her primary goals was to get women out of the house and into work so that they could participate in trade unions and other workers rights organizations in order to improve conditions for themselves. While she argued that the socialist movement should fight to achieve reforms that would lessen female oppression, she was convinced that such reforms could only prevail if they were embedded into a general move towards socialism, since, otherwise, they could easily be eradicated by future legislation. === Opposition to World War I === During the period of the First World War, at the international women's peace conference in Switzerland, activists, revolutionaries, and supporters gathered to confront the concern for unity among workers across the battle lines. There, Zetikin spoke: : Who profits from this war? Only a tiny minority in each nation: The manufacturers of rifles and cannons, of armor-plate and torpedo boats, the shipyard owners and the suppliers of the armed forces' needs. In the interests of their profits, they have fanned the hatred among the people, thus contributing to the outbreak of the war. The workers have nothing to gain from this war, but they stand to lose everything that is dear to them. Around that time Zetkin, along with Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Luise Kähler and other influential SPD politicians, rejected the party's policy of Burgfrieden (a truce with the government, promising to refrain from any strikes during the war).Klara Zetkin, \\"German Women to Their Sisters in Great Britain\\" December 1913 Among other anti-war activities, Zetkin organized an international socialist women's anti-war conference in Berlin in 1915.Timeline of Clara Zetkin's life, at the Lebendiges Museum Online (LEMO) Because of her anti-war opinions, she was arrested several times during the war, and in 1916 taken into \\"protective custody\\" (from which she was later released on account of illness). === Becoming a member of the Communist Party === In 1916 Zetkin was one of the co-founders of the Spartacist League and the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) which had split off in 1917 from its mother party, the SPD, in protest at its pro-war stance. In January 1919, after the German Revolution in November of the previous year, the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was founded; Zetkin also joined this and represented the party from 1920 to 1933 in the Reichstag.Marxist Internet Archive Biography She interviewed Lenin on \\"The Women's Question\\" in 1920.The interview transcript (in English) is available at The Emancipation of Women: From the Writings of V.I. Lenin, interview with Clara Zetkin, International Publishers, on the Marxist Archives Memorial bust of Clara Zetkin in Dresden Until 1924 Zetkin was a member of the KPD's central office; from 1927 to 1929 she was a member of the party's central committee. She was also a member of the executive committee of the Communist International (Comintern) from 1921 to 1933. She also presided over an international secretariat for women, which was created by the Communist International in October 1920. In June 1921, the Second International Conference of Communist Women, which was held in Moscow and was chaired by Clara Zetkin changed the date of the International Women's Day to 8 March. This remains the date of the IWD until today. In 1925 she was elected president of the German left-wing solidarity organisation Rote Hilfe. In August 1932, as the chairwoman of the Reichstag by seniority, she was entitled to give the opening address, and used it to call for workers to unite in the struggle against fascism, stating: : The most important immediate task is the formation of a United Front of all workers in order to turn back fascism [..] in order to preserve for the enslaved and exploited, the force and power of their organization as well as to maintain their own physical existence. Before this compelling historical necessity, all inhibiting and dividing political, trade union, religious and ideological opinions must take a back seat. All those who feel themselves threatened, all those who suffer and all those who long for liberation must belong to the United Front against fascism and its representatives in government. She was a recipient of the Order of Lenin (1932) and the Order of the Red Banner (1927). ===Exile and death=== When Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over power, the Communist Party of Germany was banned, following the Reichstag fire in 1933. Zetkin went into exile for the last time, this time to the Soviet Union. She died there, at Arkhangelskoye, near Moscow, in 1933, aged nearly 76. Her ashes were placed in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, by the Moscow Kremlin Wall, near the Red Square. The funeral was attended by leading communists from all over Europe, including Joseph Stalin and Nadezhda Krupskaya (Lenin's widow).

The Constitution of Haiti provides for the election of the President, Parliament, and members of local governing bodies. The current president is Michel Joseph Martelly, who received 68 percent of the votes in the Haitian general election, 2010–2011. Elections, delayed after a political impasse, are planned to be held for both the Presidency and Parliament in 2015. ==2010-2011 elections== The latest presidential election took place on November 28, 2010, with a run-off election taking place on March 20, 2011. No candidate received a majority of the vote cast in the first-round election. A second round was scheduled for March 20, 2011 with the two highest vote-getters, Mirlande Manigat and Jude Célestin. Protests claiming fraudulent voting resulted in the electoral commission removing Célestin from the race. This promoted Martelly from his original third-place finish in the first-round, to face Manigat in the run-off. ==2010 and following== The last presidential election was held on 28 November 2010 with a runoff on 20 March 2011. Michel Martelly won the runoff election held on 20 March 2011 with 67.6% of the vote against 31.7% for Mirlande Manigat and was sworn into office on 14 May 2011. The next presidential election is to be held in 2015. A president may not serve consecutive terms. The President named as Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe, who was subsequently ratified by the National Assembly. Prime Minister Lamothe took office on 16 May 2012. He subsequently resigned in 2014 after a series of protests. The bicameral National Assembly of Haiti (Assemblée Nationale) consists of the Chamber of Deputies (Chambre des Députés) and the Senate (Sénat). The Chamber of Deputies has ninety-nine members, who are elected by popular vote for four-year terms. The Senate consists of thirty members elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms, with one third elected every two years. The last elections were held on 28 November 2010 with run-off elections on 20 March 2011. Election results: 2010 Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Inite 6, ALTENATIV 4, LAVNI 1; 2010 Chamber of Deputies- percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Inite 32, Altenativ 11, Ansanm Nou Fo 10, AAA 8, LAVNI 7, RASANBLE 4, KONBIT 3, MOCHRENA 3, Platforme Liberation 3, PONT 3, Repons Peyizan 3, Independent 2, MAS 2, MODELH-PRDH 1, PLAPH 1, RESPE 1, Veye Yo 1, vacant 4. The next Senate election, for one third of the seats, was to be held in 2012 but was not called. On 22 November 2013, President Martelly convened an extraordinary session of the National Assembly and a bill respecting elections was passed, paving the way for the overdue and scheduled elections. In January 2015, after a series of disputed, unconstitutional, electoral commissions named by President Martelly were rejected by the legislature, a Provisional Elections Committee was inaugurated and began planning presidential and parliamentary elections later in 2015. ==References== ==External links== * *Adam Carr's Election Archive *International Mission for Monitoring Haitian Elections *IFES Observer Mission in Haiti Photo Gallery *European Union Election Observation Mission to Haiti (in French) ","title":"Elections in Haiti"},{"id":"1424429","text":"Honduras National Congress has 128 members (diputados); they serve four-year terms.

Its main dam, which disconnected Plover Cove from the sea, was one of the largest in the world at the time of its construction. ==History== Service Dam for Plover Cove Reservoir (Northern one on the right,Southern one on the left.) === Planning === Hong Kong lacks significant natural inland water bodies, and providing water supply to the territory's population has long been problematic. On 24 July 1958, it was disclosed by a government spokesman that government engineers were studying the idea of converting sea inlets into freshwater lakes, and cited Plover Cove as one of the foremost areas under consideration. The plan was considered feasible as the cove was mostly enclosed on three sides, and could be fully cut off from the sea by damming sections of the Tolo Harbour known to be very shallow. The government hired the engineering consultancy Binnie, Deacon and Gourley to undertake a preliminary investigation. In mid-1959 the engineers delivered a report confirming the feasibility of the plan and laying out the basic arrangement of the proposed dams. They estimated that construction would cost about HK$348 million, plus approximately $60 million for the associated water distribution network. === Construction === One main dam and three service dams were built to shut the cove off from the sea. The cove was then drained and was converted into a freshwater lake. Construction work commenced in 1960 and was completed in 1968, providing a capacity of 170 million m3. Work on raising the height of the dams began in 1970. Upon completion in 1973, the reservoir capacity was increased to 230 million m3.Water Supplies Department: Plover Cove Reservoir The dam of the reservoir is 28 metres tall and approximately 2 km long. Besides rain from its catchment, it also stores water imported by pipes from the East River in China. The Bride's Pool flows into the Plover Cove Reservoir. ==Displaced people== Road on top of the main dam. The creation of the Plover Cove Reservoir necessitated the displacement of the inhabitants of a number of Hakka villages which were covered by the reservoir. The Hakka villagers were compensated by the Hong Kong British colonial government with apartments and shop units along Kwong Fuk Road in Tai Po which were built for their resettlement there. Fisherman who used to live at the original Sam Mun Tsai site, close to Tai Kau of Luk Heung, now at the northeastern shore of Reservoir, were relocated to Sam Mun Tsai New Village on the island of Yim Tin Tsai (Tai Po District) in 1966. At the time, 36 families were moved to housing on land.Liu T.S., \\"Home on the Water: Livelihood and Society of the Fishermen Community in Tai Po\\" , Tai Po Book pp. 115–116 ==The reservoir today== Plover Cove Reservoir is a natural fish pond that supports a diverse wildlife, including many freshwater fish species.

Their name is commonly mispronounced \\"AKA Moon\\" like the acronym for \\"also known as\\". The correct pronunciation is \\"AH- kah MOON\\". ==Music career== ===Founding and style=== The founders of the trio are saxophonist Fabrizio Cassol, bassist Michel Hatzigeorgiou, and drummer Stéphane Galland. All three were in groups, including the Nasa Na Band with guitarist Pierre Van Dormael, before forming Aka Moon. They formed the band after spending time in the Central African Republic studying the musical habits of Aka pygmies. In 1992, they released their first, self-titled album, inspired by how pygmies created music. Aka Moon combines jazz, rock, and world music. Their refreshing approach to jazz gives the trio a highly distinctive sound. They could be compared musically and philosophically with the M-Base movement and M-Base founder Steve Coleman, Belgian ensemble Octurn, Stéphane Payen's Thôt, Sylvain Cathala 's Print, Vijay Iyer, and Rudresh Mahanthappa. After their encounter with the AKA Pygmees, Aka Moon’s focus has shifted towards various different African, Indian, Maghrebian, Cuban, Arab, Afro- American and European traditions, due to their extended collaborations with international artists. ===Albums=== Their first few albums released in the early 1990s (Aka Moon, Rebirth, and Live at Kaai) featured the original trio. In the mid-90s, the band included Indian musicians and music for Akasha Vol. 1 and Akasha Vol. 2, which used flute, tabla, and mridangam. Ganesh added guitarist Marc Ducret. Elohim featured a more electric line-up, with vocalist David Linx and keyboardist Benoit Delbecq. Live at Vooruit featured percussionist Doudou N'Diaye Rose. In the late 1990s, the group produced the trilogy Invisible Mother, Invisible Sun, and Invisible Moon. The concept was based around the Chinese I Ching (book of changes). Invisible Mother has the trio playing with the Ictus Ensemble, a European chamber band. The music showcases a dark, chamber string-quartet side of the band and lays the groundwork for the follow-up albums in the trilogy. Invisible Sun is an eleven-piece big band. Invisible Moon features Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman and Benoit Delbecq. Aka Moon revisits and rearranges several themes found in different spots throughout the trilogy. In Real Time (2001) was composed for ballet company of Anne-Teresa De Keersmaeker Rosas. Guitars (2002) included jazz guitarist David Gilmore. Like earlier works, there are examples of recurring, rearranged themes within the album as the group pays hommage to several different guitarists and their styles: like John Scofield, Bill Frisell, and Paco De Lucia. Amazir (2006) included Magic Malik (flute, voice) and Fabian Fiorini (piano). For Culture Griot (2009) the band invited Baba Sissoko and for The Scarlatti Book (2015) pianist Fabian Fiorini. In 2017, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary with a music box, Constellations Box (Outhere Music), which consists of 20 albums. The last album is called Light Ship Trio on which you can hear an unpublished, old recording. In 2018, the group releases the trio album NOW (Outhere Music). == Discography == On Carbon 7 Records: * Aka Moon (1992) * Nzomba (1992) * Rebirth (1994) * Akasha Vol. 1 (1995) * Akasha Vol. 2 (1995) * Ganesh (1997) * Elohim (1997) * Live at Vooruit (1998) * Live at the Kaai (1999) * Invisible Mother (1999) * Invisible Sun (2000) * In Real Time (2001) * Invisible Moon (2001) On De W.E.R.F.

It has been popularly contextualized within the so-called \\"Past-Tense Debate,\\" which was sparked by Rumelhart and McClelland's 1986 connectionist model of the production of regular and irregular verbs. In essence, the Words and Rules theory states that past-tense forms of verbs arise from both declarative memory (as words) and procedural systems (from rules). ==Main Ideas== In his book, Pinker \\"tries to illuminate the nature of language and mind by choosing a single phenomenon and examining it from every angle imaginable.\\" His analysis reflects his view that language and many other aspects of human nature are innate evolutionary-psychological adaptations. Most of the book examines studies conducted on the form and frequency of grammatical errors (such as overgeneralization in past-tense formation) in English (and to a lesser extent in German) as well as the speech of brain-damaged persons with selective aphasia. Pinker discusses neuropsychological dissociations in two types of aphasia: anomia and agrammatism. Anomic patients often produce fluent and generally grammatical speech despite having difficulty retrieving and recognizing words, which implies the lexicon is \\"more impaired than grammatical combination.\\" Some patients also have jargon aphasia in which they speak their own neologisms (e.g. \\"nose cone\\" for \\"phone call\\") and often add regular suffixes onto their jargon, which suggests the area of the brain that computes regular inflection is distinct from the area in which words are processed. In contrast, agrammatic patients have difficulty assembling words into phrases and sentences and applying correct grammatical suffixes (either omitting them altogether or using the wrong one) and are therefore unable to produce fluent grammatical sequences. For example, when reading a list of words patients might read smiled as \\"smile\\" and wanted as \\"wanting\\"; the reason being that regularly inflected words are computed by rules as they are read, and that agrammatic patients have damage to the machinery that does the computing. However, when reading irregular past-tense forms and plurals, patients with impaired grammatical processing make fewer errors as they are still able to match irregular verbs against memory as wholes. The title, Words and Rules, refers to a model Pinker believes best represents how words are represented in the mind. He writes that words are either stored directly with their associated meanings in the lexicon (or \\"mental dictionary\\") or are constructed using morphological rules. Leak and rose, for example, would be stored as mental dictionary entries, but the words leaked and roses do not need to be memorized separately, as they can be easily constructed by applying \\"rules\\" that add the appropriate suffixes (i.e. \\"adding '-ed'\\" to form the past-tense form and \\"adding '-s'\\" to form the plural form, respectively). In analyzing the errors English-speaking children make (such as the over- application of morphological rules to create words like mouses and bringed), Pinker concludes that irregular forms are not remembered in terms of the supposed rules that produce them (such as a rule that would produce sleep/slept, weep/wept, keep/kept, etc.), but instead are memorized separately, while the rule for forming regular past-tense forms (i.e. \\"adding '-ed') applies by default. ==Research== The Words and Rules model contradicts previous orthodox Chomskyan ideas hypothesizing that several irregular past tense forms arise from rules applied to verbs with phonological similarities (as seen with the example of sleep, weep, and keep above). He particularly notes discrepancies that would arise in application of a rule-based theory, as in the verb steep and its past-tense form steeped as opposed to steep/stept. Pinker accepts the notion of pattern associators from the connectionist model, which states that families of irregular verbs obtain their past-tense forms from associations between the phonological features of these verbs and those of their irregular past-tense forms. Pinker found that some adults and children will form the past-tense form splung from the novel verb spling in line with the pattern seen in fling/flung and cling/clung. However, he shows research showing these sorts of generalizations to be exceedingly rare in comparison to the over-application of the regular past-tense rule to these verbs. He additionally points out that connectionist models tend to produce odd past-tense forms of verbs that otherwise have regular past-tense forms (e.g. membled for mail). ==References== ==External links== *Pinker's website on Words and Rules *Dig-dug, think-thunk by Charles Yang, a critical review of Words and Rules Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:Cognitive science literature Category:Morphology books Category:Works by Steven Pinker Category:English-language books ","title":"Words and Rules"},{"id":"1424473","text":"Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan (born 24 October 1940) is an Indian space scientist who headed the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from 1994 to 2003.

He was also the Chairman of the Governing Council of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad and Nehru Planetarium at Bengaluru and chancellor of the Indian Institute for Space Science and Technology (IIST) at Thiruvananthapuram. Rao was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1976, and Padma Vibhushan in 2017. He was inducted into the Satellite Hall of Fame, Washington, on 19 March 2013 at a ceremony organised by the Society of Satellite Professionals International. With this he became the first Indian to be inducted. He was also to be inducted in International Astronautics Federation (IAF) as on 15 May 2016. He was also the first Indian again to achieve such a feat. == Early life == U. R. Rao was born at Adamaru in the state of Karnataka. In a Bramhin society his parents were Lakshminarayana Acharya and Krishnaveni Amma. He had his primary education at Adamaru. He completed his secondary education from Christian High School, Udupi. He completed his B.Sc in Government Arts and Science College, Anantpur, M.Sc from Banaras Hindu University and Ph.D at Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad under the guidance of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.Prof. U. R. Rao was married to Mrs. Yashoda Rao. ==Education== *Ph.D. – Gujarat University, 1960 *M.Sc. – Banaras Hindu University, 1954 *B.Sc. – Madras University, 1952 After working as a Faculty Member at MIT and Assistant Professor at University of Texas at Dallas where he carried out investigations as a prime experimenter on a number of Pioneer and Explorer spacecraft, Rao returned to India in 1966 as a professor at the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad. == Career == Rao started his career as a cosmic ray scientist, and worked under Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, which he continued at MIT. In association with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory group, he was the first to establish the continuous nature of the solar wind and its effect on geomagnetism using Mariner 2 observations. Rao's experiments on a number of Pioneer and Explorer spacecraft led to a complete understanding of the solar cosmic ray phenomena and the electromagnetic state of the interplanetary space. Convinced of the imperative need to use space technology for rapid development, Rao undertook the responsibility for the establishment of satellite technology in India in 1972. Under his guidance, beginning with the first Indian satellite \\"Aryabhata\\" in 1975, over 18 satellites including Bhaskara, APPLE, Rohini, INSAT-1 and INSAT-2 series of multipurpose satellites and the IRS-1A and IRS-1B remote sensing satellites were designed, fabricated and launched for providing communication, remote sensing and meteorological services. == As Chairman of ISRO == After taking charge as Chairman, Space Commission and Secretary, Department of Space in 1985, Rao accelerated the development of rocket technology resulting in the successful launch of ASLV rocket in 1992. He was also responsible for the development of the operational PSLV launch vehicle, which successfully launched an 850 kg. satellite into a polar orbit in 1995. Rao initiated the development of the geostationary launch vehicle GSLV and the development of cryogenic technology in 1991. He was responsible for successful launch of INSAT satellites during his stint at ISRO. The launch of INSAT satellites gave a thrust to communications in India, during the 1980s and 1990s. The successful launch of INSAT provided telecommunication links to remote corners of India. During these decades fixed telephone (called as landline) expanded throughout country due to availability of satellite links at different places in the ground. People could talk easily from anywhere by use of STD (Subscriber Trunk Dialing) instead of waiting for hours to get the connection. This development played a key role in future for India to develop as an Information Technology hub. He was the first Chairman of Antrix Corporation. he received Padma bhushana in 1976. == Additional responsibilities == Chairman, Karnataka Science and Technology Academy, Chairman, Bangalore Association of Science Education-JNP, Chancellor, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, Member, Central Board of Directors, Reserve Bank of India, Additional Director, Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Ltd., Bangalore, Chairman of the Governing Council of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. Rao published over 300 scientific and technical papers in various national and international journals covering cosmic rays, interplanetary physics, high energy astrophysics, space applications and satellite and rocket technology. He has authored many books, including \\"Physics of the Communication\\", \\"Space and Agenda 21 - Caring for the Planet Earth\\" and \\"Space Technology for Sustainable Development\\". Rao was an elected Fellow of many academies such as Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineers, International Academy of Astronautics and Third World Academy of Sciences. Rao was conferred Fellowship of the World Academy of Arts & Sciences. He was the General President of the Indian Science Congress Association for 1995-96. Rao was the Vice President of International Astronautical Federation (IAF) during 1984 to 1992 and continues to be the Chairman of the Committee for Liaison with Developing Countries (CLIODN) since 1986. Rao was elected as the Chairman of United Nations - Committee On Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN-COPUOS) in June 1997 and also Chairman of UNISPACE-III Conference. He was elected as the Chairman of the 30th International Antarctic Treaty Consultative Committee Meeting at Delhi in April 2007. He was the Co-Chairman of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research, Goa. He was the first chairman of Prasar Bharati. == Awards == He was the recipient of many national and international awards, such as : ;National Awards *1975 Karnataka Rajyotsava Award *1975 Hari Om Vikram Sarabhai Award *1975 Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in the Space science & technology field *1976 Padma Bhushan *1980 National Design Award *1980 Vasvik Research Award in the Electronic Sciences & Technology field *1983 Karnataka Rajyotsava Award *1987 PC Mahalnobis Medal *1993 Om Prakash Bhasin Award in the Energy & Aerospace field *1993 Meghnad Saha Medal *1994 P.C.

Although interfaith marriages are most often contracted as civil marriages, in some instances they may be contracted as a religious marriage. This depends on religious doctrine of the two parties' religions; some of which prohibit interfaith marriage, but others allow it in limited circumstances. Several major religions are mute on the issue, and still others allow it with requirements for ceremony and custom. For ethno-religious groups, resistance to interfaith marriage may be a form of self-segregation. In an interfaith marriage, each partner typically adheres to their own religion, but an important point is in what faith the children will be raised. == Human rights == According to Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, men and women who have attained the age of majority have the right to marry \\"without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion\\". Although most of Article 16 is incorporated verbatim in Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the references to religious and racial limitations is omitted. Article 17, clause two of the American Convention on Human Rights says that all men and women have the right to marry, subject to the conditions of domestic law \\"insofar as such conditions do not affect the principle of nondiscrimination established in this Convention.\\" == By religion == === Judaism === Interfaith marriage in Judaism was historically viewed with disfavor by Jewish leaders, and it remains controversial. The Talmud and poskim prohibit non-Jews to marry Jews, and discuss when the prohibition is from the Torah and when it is rabbinical.Talmud Bavli, Avodah Zarah 36b; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations 12:1 and commentaries; Rabbi Yosef Karo, Shulchan Aruch II:16:2 and commentaries In 1236, Moses of Coucy encouraged Jewish men who had married Christian or Muslim women to divorce them.Moses of Coucy, Sefer Mitzvot ha-Gadol, 112, as per JE In 1844, the reform Rabbinical Conference of Brunswick permitted Jews to marry \\"any adherent of a monotheistic religion\\" if children of the marriage were raised Jewish.Jewish Encyclopedia, Intermarriage This conference was controversial; one of its resolutions called on members to abolish the Kol Nidre prayer, which opens the Yom Kippur service.Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Conferences, Rabbinical\\" One member of the conference later changed his opinion, becoming an opponent of intermarriage.Ludwig Philippson, Israelitische Religionslehre (1865), 3:350 Traditional Judaism does not consider marriage between a Jew by birth and a convert as intermarriage;Berakhot 28aKiddushin 5:4 (Tosefta)Rabbi Yosef Karo, Shulchan Aruch III:4:10 Biblical passages which apparently support intermarriage, such as that of Joseph to Asenath and Ruth to Boaz, were regarded by classical rabbis as having occurred after the non-Jewish spouse had converted.Genesis Rabbah, 65 Some still considered Canaanites forbidden to marry even after conversion, although this did not necessarily apply to their children.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sanctity, Laws of Prohibited Relations, 12:22 and Maggid Mashnah ad. loc. Orthodox Judaism refuses to accept intermarriage, and tries to avoid facilitating them. Conservative Judaism does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse by the family in the hope that such acceptance will lead to the spouse's conversion to Judaism.Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism, Statement on Intermarriage, Adopted on March 7, 1995 In December 2014 the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism's United Synagogue Youth controversially modified a binding rule that its leaders would not date non-Jews, replacing it with a \\"recogni[tion of] the importance of dating within the Jewish community.\\" Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not generally regard the authority of classical rabbis; many rabbis from these denominations are willing to officiate at interfaith marriages,Survey of the American Rabbinate, The Jewish Outreach Institute, (retrieved 6 May 2009)Summary of Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling 2003 Survey, Irwin H. Fishbein, Rabbi, D. Min., Rabbinic Center for Research and Counseling, (retrieved 6 May 2009) although they try to persuade intermarried couples to raise their children as Jews. In 1870, some Reform Jews published the opinion that intermarriage is prohibited.D.Einhorn, in The Jewish Times, (1870), No. 45, p. 11 In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first movement within Judaism to allow rabbis to have relationships with non-Jewish partners. Humanistic Judaism is a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life, defining Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people. The Society for Humanistic Judaism answers the question, \\"Is intermarriage contributing to the demise of Judaism?\\" on its website: \\"Intermarriage is the positive consequence of a free and open society. If the Jewish community is open, welcoming, embracing, and pluralistic, we will encourage more people to identify with the Jewish people rather than fewer. Intermarriage could contribute to the continuity of the Jewish people.\\" During the early 19th century, intermarriage was relatively rare; less than one-tenth of one percent of the Jews of Algeria, for example, practiced exogamy.Ricoux, Demography of Algeria, Paris, 1860, p. 71 Since the early 20th century, rates of Jewish intermarriage have increased. In the United States from 1996 to 2001, nearly half (47 percent) of marriages involving Jews were intermarriages with non-Jewish partnersNational Jewish Population Survey 2000-01 (a similar proportion—44 percent—as in the early 20th century in New South Wales).Census of New South Wales, 1901, Bulletin No. 14 === Hinduism === In Hinduism, spiritual texts like Vedas and Gita do not speak of caste and interfaith marriages. However, law books like Manusmriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti, and Parashara speak of marriage rules among various kulas and gotras. Manusmriti versions are numerous as the original is not preserved and also represents one of the oldest attempts to formally regulate the secular society of India. It is not a religious text. According to the varna system, marriage is normally between two individuals of the same varna. Ancient Hindu literature identified four varnas: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. In ancient India, this varna system was strictly professional division based on one's profession. With time, it became a birthright. According to Manusmriti, partners in an intra-gotra marriage should be shunned as it is an equivalent of a sibling marriage shunned. In rural parts of modern-day India, which is mainly conservative, follows this rule, while Hindus living in the cities and abroad often accept the inter-caste marriage. === Sikhism === Some gurdwaras allow weddings between a Sikh and a non-Sikh, but others oppose it. In 2014, the Sikh Council in the UK developed a consistent approach towards marriages in Gurdwaras where one partner is not of Sikh origin, following a two-year consultation with Gurdwara Sahib Committees, Sikh Organisations, and individuals. The resulting guidelines were approved by the General Assembly of Sikh Council UK on 11 October 2014, and state that Gurdwaras are encouraged to ensure that both parties to an Anand Karaj wedding are Sikhs, but that where a couple chooses to undertake a civil marriage they should be offered the opportunity to hold an Ardas, Sukhmani Sahib Path, Akhand Path, or other service to celebrate their marriage in the presence of family and friends. Some gurdwaras permit mixed marriages, which has led to controversy. === Zoroastrianism === Some traditional Zoroastrians in India disapprove of and discourage interfaith marriages, and female adherents who marry outside the faith are often considered to be excommunicated. When a female adherent marries a partner from another religion, they go through the risk of not being able to enter the Agyaris and Atash Behrams. In the past, their partner and children were forbidden from entering Zoroastrian religious buildings; this is often still observed. A loophole was found to avoid such expulsion: the offspring (especially born out of wedlock) of a Parsi man and a non-Parsi woman were often \\"adopted\\" by the Parsi father and tacitly accepted into the religion. Alternatively in a few cases such as that of Suzanne RD Tata, the non-Zoroastrian spouse has been allowed to convert Zoroastrianism by undergoing the navjote ritual Interfaith marriages may skew Zoroastrian demographics, since the number of adherents is low. According to Indian law (where most Parsis live), only the father of the child must be a Zoroastrian for the child (or children) to be accepted into the faith. This has been debated, since the religion promotes gender equality (which the law violates). Zoroastrians in North America and Europe defy the rule, and children of a non- Zoroastrian father are accepted as Zoroastrians. === Christianity === Some Christian denominations forbid interfaith marriage, citing 2 Corinthians 6:14 (although 1 Corinthians 7:14 allows it depending on the interpretations) and Deuteronomy 7:3 (depending on interpretation). In the Catholic Church, canon law deals with mixed marriages (a marriage between a Catholic and a baptized person outside the Church) and marriages in disparity of cult (marriage between a Catholic and an unbaptized person). Distinction is made between inter-denominational and interfaith marriage, and some denominations extend their own rules and practices to other Christian denominations. === Islam === A primary Islamic legal concern is that the offspring of an interfaith marriage between a Muslim a non-Muslim are to be Muslim offspring, and raised as such. Sharia, thus, has differing regulations on interfaith marriage, depending on, firstly, what is the gender of the prospective intermarrying Muslim, and secondly, what non-Muslim religion is adhered to by the person that a Muslim is seeking to intermarry with. While Islamic Law permits a Muslim man to marry up to four women, the preference is that one or all of his wives be Muslim. If he intermarried with a non-Muslim, one or more of the four allowed wives may be non-Muslim women provided that they are from among the People of the Book (i.e. female Christians or female Jews). Additionally, they must have been chaste, and all children must be brought up Muslim. Beyond this exemption, a Muslim man may not intermarry with females who are not from among the People of the Book unless they convert to Islam (which is not required of Christian females and Jewish females). Thus, Muslim men are prohibited from intermarrying, for instance, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, etc., as well as pagans or atheists, unless the woman converts to Islam. If they did, however, convert, it would no longer be considered intermarriage, but a marriage between Muslims, and thus not prohibited. According to traditional understandings of interfaith marriage in Islam, Muslim women are forbidden from intermarrying based on Islamic law.Saeed, Hassan (2004): Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam. Ashgate Publishing. .Daniels, Timothy P. (2005): Building Cultural Nationalism in Malaysia. Routledge. .Altstein,Howard;Simon, Rita James (2003): Global perspectives on social issues: marriage and divorce. Lexington, Mass: LexingtonBooks. . This is understood to be irrespective of whether or not she wishes to marry a male from among the People or the Book (i.e. a male Christian or Jew) or a male of any other religion. Based on this interpretation, this would not apply if the non-Muslim man converted to Islam, as the Muslim woman would no longer be considered to be intermarrying, but marrying a Muslim man. Additionally, she may only be married to one Muslim man at any one time (i.e. she may not have multiple husbands at the same time). The Quran states, “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al‑Mushrikoon till they believe (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”[al-Baqarah 2:221] Early jurists in the most-prominent schools of Islamic jurisprudence ruled in fiqh that the marriage of a Muslim man to a Christian or Jewish woman is makruh (disapproved) if they live in a non-Muslim country. Umar (634–644) denied interfaith marriage to Muslim men during his command of the ummah. According to the Quran, > Today the good things are made lawful for you, and the food of the ones to > whom the Book was brought is lawful to you, and your food is made lawful to > them. And (so) are believing women in wedlock, and in wedlock women of (the > ones) to whom the Book was brought even before you when you have brought > them their rewards in wedlock, other than in fornication, neither taking > them to yourselves as mates (i.e., girl-friends). And whoever disbelieves in > belief, (i.e., the religion) then his deed has been frustrated and in the > Hereafter, he is among the losers. (Surah 5:5) Scholar Ahmad Kutty of Toronto has expressed disapproval of interfaith marriage, citing Umar. According to scholar Bilal Philips, the verse permitting Muslim men to marry non-Muslim women is no longer valid for several reasons (including its misinterpretation). Canadian Islamic scholar Shabir Ally has also said that it is makruh for a Muslim man to marry outside his religion. This prohibition preserves and expands Islam in patriarchal, multi- faith societies. It ensures that over a number of generations, Islam would gain in numbers relative to other religions.Ben Youssef Zayzafoon, Lamia. The production of the Muslim woman: negotiating text, history, and ideology (Oxford, UK: Lexington Books, 2005) 108. If a non-Muslim woman married to non-Muslim converts to Islam, the marriage is suspended until her husband converts to Islam; she could theoretically leave the non-Muslim husband and marry a Muslim one, analogous to the Pauline privilege for Catholics. If the non-Muslim husband converts, a new marriage is not needed. According to the Quran, > O ye who believe! When there come to you believing women refugees, examine > (and test) them: Allah knows best as to their Faith: if ye ascertain that > they are Believers, then send them not back to the Unbelievers. They are not > lawful (wives) for the Unbelievers, nor are the (Unbelievers) lawful > (husbands) for them. But pay the Unbelievers what they have spent (on their > dower), and there will be no blame on you if ye marry them on payment of > their dower to them. But hold not to the guardianship of unbelieving women: > ask for what ye have spent on their dowers, and let the (Unbelievers) ask > for what they have spent (on the dowers of women who come over to you). Such > is the command of Allah. He judges (with justice) between you. And Allah is > Full of Knowledge and Wisdom. (Surah 60:10) === Baháʼí Faith === According to the Baháʼí Faith, all religions are inspired by God and interfaith marriage is permitted. A Baháʼí ceremony should be performed with the non-Baháʼí rite (or ceremony). If both ceremonies are performed, the non-Baháʼí ceremony should not invalidate the Baháʼí ceremony; the Baháʼí partner remains a Baháʼí, and is not adopting the religion of the other partner in the ceremony. The Baháʼí partner should also abstain from vows (or statements) committing them to a declaration of faith in another religion or that are contrary to the principles of the Baháʼí Faith. The two ceremonies should be performed on the same day; their order is not important. The Baháʼí ceremony may be performed in the place of worship of the other religion if it is afforded respect equal to the non-Baháʼí ceremony and is clearly distinct from the non-Baháʼí ceremony. === Serer religion === In orthodox Serer religion (an ethnoreligious faith), interfaith and interracial marriages are forbidden.

It originated in the music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) between the 9th and 15th centuries. Some of its poems derive from famous authors such as Al-Shushtari, Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. ==Origins== Andalusian classical music was allegedly born in the Emirate of Cordoba (Al-Andalus) in the 9th century. Born and raised in Iraq, Ziryâb (d. 857), who later became court musician of Abd al-Rahman II in Cordoba, is sometimes credited with its invention. Later, the poet, composer, and philosopher Ibn Bajjah (d. 1139) of Saragossa is said to have combined the style of Ziryâb with Western approaches to produce a wholly new style that spread across Iberia and North Africa. By the 10th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours and trouvères and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. The English words lute, rebec, guitar, and naker derive from the Arabic oud, rabab, qithara and naqareh, although some Arabic terms (qithara, for example) had been derived in their turn from Vulgar Latin, Greek and other languages like Persian. Mass resettlements of Muslims and Sephardi Jews from Cordoba, Sevilla, Valencia, and Granada, fleeing the Reconquista, further expanded the reach of Andalusian music, though not without changes. In North Africa, the Andalusian music traditions all feature a suite known as a nūba (colloquial Arabic from the formal Arabic nawba: a \\"turn\\" or opportunity to perform), an idea which may have originated in Islamic Iberia, but took on many different forms in the new environments. Moreover, these migrants from the 13th century on encountered ethnic Andalusian communities that had migrated earlier to North Africa, which helped this elite music to take root and spread among wider audiences. In his book Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, Haïm Zafrani writes: \\"In the Maghreb, the Muslims and Jews have piously preserved the Spanish-Arabic music .... In Spain and Maghreb, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....\\" Indeed, as in so many other areas of Andalusian culture and society, Jews have played an important role in the evolution and preservation of the musical heritage of al-Andalus throughout its history. From the very beginning, one of Ziryāb's colleagues at the court of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān II was a fine musician Manṣūr al-Yahūdī (\\"Mansur the Jew\\"). The scholars Avraham Elam-Amzallag and Edwin Seroussi further highlight the important role played by Jews in the history of Andalusian music, pointing out that not only have many important North African Andalusian musicians been Jews, but also Moroccan Jewish communities today in Israel preserve Andalusian melodies and even song texts in their religious music.Elam-Amzallag, Avraham (1997) \\"La ala andalouse chez les Juifs et les Arabes du Maroc\\" in Relations Judéo-Musulmanes au Maroc: Perceptions et Réalités, edited by Robert Assaraf and Michel Abitbol. Statvit. pp. 295-302. A number of old manuscripts preserve song texts and elements of Andalusian musical philosophy. The oldest surviving collection of these texts is found in two chapters from Aḥmad al-Tīfāshī's al- Mutʿat al-asmāʿ fī ʿilm al-mūsīqā wa-l-samāʿ (ca. 1253).Edited by al-Ṭanjī in Al-Abhath 21 (1968). See footnote 2 above. More recent is a document entitled, al-ʿAdharā al-māʾisāt fī-l-azjāl wa-l-muwashshaḥāt (\\"The Virgins Swaying for Zajals and Muwashshaḥs\\"), which probably dates to the middle of the 15th century and seems to be linked to the Andalusian music of Tlemcen in Algeria. By far the best-documented Andalusian tradition is that of Morocco, with the first surviving anthology having been produced by Muḥammad al-Būʿiṣāmī (d. ca. 1738). But the most important collection was Kunnāsh al-Ḥāʾik (the first of several versions is dated 1202/1788), which was revised by the wazīr al-Jāmiʿī in 1886 (numerous copies are found in libraries in Morocco, Madrid, London and Paris). Each of the modern nations of North Africa has at least one style of Andalusian music. In Morocco the secular instrumental version is called Al- Āla, while the religious a cappella style is called al-samāʿ wa-l-madih. In Algeria there are three styles: al-Gharnāṭī (referring to Granada) in the west, al-ṣanʿa in the region around Algiers, and al-mālūf in the east. The Tunisian and Libyan traditions are also called al-mālūf, as well.(footnote 12) ==The music today== A suite form called the Andalusi nubah forms the basis of al-āla. Though it has roots in al-Andalus, the modern nūba is probably a North African creation. Each nūba is dominated by one musical mode. It is said that there used to be twenty-four nūbāt linked to each hour of the day, but in Algeria there are only sixteen, and in Morocco eleven have survived (although some nūbāt in Morocco incorporate more than one mode—24 modes in all).See Davila (2013) p. 325. Nūba structures vary considerably among the various national traditions. In Morocco, each nūba is divided into five parts called mîzân, each with a corresponding rhythm. The rhythms occur in the following order in a complete n _u_ ba (though an entire nūba is never performed in one sitting): #basît (6/4) #qâ'im wa niṣf (8/4) #btâyhî (8/4) #darj (4/4) #quddâm (3/4 or 6/8) Andalusian classical music orchestras are spread across the Maghreb, including the cities of: * Algeria: Tlemcen, Nedroma, Cherchell, Algiers, Bejaia, Blida, Constantine, Annaba, Souk Ahras, Sidi Bel Abbès, Oran, Koléa, Blida, Mostaganem **In Algeria, three main styles or schools are to be found: ***The Gharnati of the region of Tlemcen. ***The of the region of Algiers. ***The Ma'luf style in the east of the country in Constantine and Annaba. * Morocco: Fes, Meknes, Tetuan, Salé, Oujda, Rabat, Tangiers, Chefchaouen, Safi **The Al-Āla, meaning \\"instrumental music\\", as opposed to religious music which is primarily vocal is predominant. **The al-samāʿ wa-l- madih, a religious a cappella style that makes use of very similar melodic, rythmic and textual materials as Al-Ala. **The Gharnati of the school of Tlemcen is also played, mainly, in Oujda. * Tunisia: Tunis, Testour, and Kairouan. * Libya: Tripoli **In Tunisia and Libya, the Ma'luf is the main style. * Outside of the Maghreb exists the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, that plays classical Andalusian music together with piyyutim from the tradition of Sephardi Jews. They use instruments including oud (lute), rabab (rebec), darbouka (goblet drums), taarija (tambourine), qanún (zither), and kamanja (violin). More recently, other instruments have been added to the ensemble, including piano, contrabass, cello, and even banjos, saxophones, and clarinets, though these are rare. ==Influence of Andalusian music== Andalusia was probably the main route of transmission of a number of Near-Eastern musical instruments used in European music: the lute from the oud, rebec from the rebab, the guitar from qitara and Greek kithara, and the naker from the naqareh. Further terms fell into disuse in Europe: adufe from al-duff, alboka from al-buq, anafil from al-nafir, exabeba from al-shabbaba (flute), atabal (bass drum) from al-tabl, atambal from al-tinbal, the balaban, sonajas de azófar from , the conical bore wind instruments, and the from the sulami or fistula (flute or musical pipe). Most scholars believe that Guido of Arezzo's Solfège musical notation system had its origins in a Latin hymn, but others suggest that it may have had andalusian origins instead. According to Meninski in his Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum (1680), Solfège syllables may have been derived from the syllables of an Arabic (moorish) solmization system Durar Mufaṣṣalāt (\\"Separated Pearls\\"). However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory, and no Arabian musical manuscripts employing sequences from the Arabic alphabet are known to exist. Henry George Farmer believes that there is no firm evidence on the origins of the notation, and therefore the Arabian origin theory and the hymnal origin theories are equally credible. Although the philosopher al-Kindī (d. 259/874) and the author Abū l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī (d. 355/967) both mention music writing systems, they were descriptive and based on lute fingerings, and thus complicated to use. No practical, indigenous system of music writing existed in the islamic world before the colonial era. Some scholars have speculated that the troubadour tradition was brought to France from al-Andalus by the first recorded troubadour, William IX of Aquitaine (d. 1126), whose father had fought in the siege and sack of Barbastro in 1064 and brought back at least one female slave singer. It is likely that young William's taste in music and poetry was thus influenced by al-Andalus. George T. Beech observes that while the sources of William’s inspirations are uncertain, he did have Spanish individuals within his extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak Arabic. Regardless of William's involvement in the tradition's creation, Magda Bogin states that Andalusian poetry was likely one of several influences on European “courtly love poetry”. J.B. Trend has also asserted that the poetry of troubadours was connected to Andalusian poetry. ==See also== *Malhun *Andalusi nubah *Mohammed al-Haik *Abdessadeq Cheqara *Mohamed Bajeddoub *Music of Algeria *Music of Morocco *Music of Tunisia *Music of Libya ==References== ==Bibliography== *Benmoussa, Abdelfattah (2003) al-Mūsīqā l-andalusiyya \\"al-Āla\\": al-maṣādir wa al-madāris.

In other words, the expected change in physical characteristics as one quantum system passes through an interaction site. In John Bell's 1964 paper that inspired the Bell tests, it was assumed that the outcomes A and B could each only take one of two values, -1 or +1. It followed that the product, too, could only be -1 or +1, so that the average value of the product would be :\\\\frac{N_{++}- N_{+-}- N_{-+}+N_{--}}{N_{total}} where, for example, N++ is the number of simultaneous occurrences (\\"coincidences\\") of the outcome +1 on both sides of the experiment. In actual experiments though, detectors are not perfect and there are usually many null outcomes. The correlation can still be estimated using the sum of coincidences, since clearly zeros will not contribute to the average, but in practice, instead of dividing by Ntotal, it has become customary to divide by :N_{++} + N_{+-}+ N_{-+} + N_{--} the total number of observed coincidences. The legitimacy of this method relies on the assumption that the observed coincidences constitute a fair sample of the emitted pairs. Following local realist assumptions as in Bell's 1964 paper, the estimated quantum correlation will converge after a sufficient number of trials to :QC(a, b) = \\\\int d \\\\lambda \\\\rho (\\\\lambda) A(a, \\\\lambda)B(b, \\\\lambda) where a and b are detector settings and λ is the hidden variable, drawn from a distribution ρ(λ). The quantum correlation is the key statistic in the CHSH and some of the other \\"Bell inequalities\\", tests of which open the way for experimental discrimination between quantum mechanics on the one hand and local realism or local hidden variable theory on the other. ==Outside Bell test experiments== Quantum correlations give rise to various phenomena, including for example interference of particles separated in time. ==See also== *Correlation does not imply causation *EPR paradox ==References== J.

The President and National Assembly are directly elected, whilst the Senate is indirectly elected. ==Electoral history== ===Pre-independence=== Following World War II, Gabon (in a combined constituency with French Congo, began to elect members to the French National Assembly. The first elections took place in October 1945, with voters split into two colleges; the First College for French citizens and the Second for non-citizens. Gabriel d'Arboussier was elected by the First College, and although Gabonese politician Jean-Hilaire Aubame received the most votes in the Second College, the election went to a second round, where he was beaten by the Congolese Jean-Félix Tchicaya. The next elections were held in June the following year, with d'Arboussier defeated by Henri Seignon in the First College and Tchicaya re-elected in the Second. Another election was held in November that year, with the Second College gaining an extra seat, and now split into Congolese and Gabonese sections. Maurice Bayrou was elected by the still-combined First College, whilst Aubame was elected in the Gabonese Second College seat on a French Section of the Workers' International ticket. A third election in 1946 took place in December when the Representative Assembly was elected; it also used a college system, with 12 members elected by the First College and 18 by the Second. The next French elections took place in 1951, with Bayrou re-elected in the First College and Aubame in the Second. The Representative Council was converted into a Territorial Assembly prior to the 1952 elections, with Aubame's Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) winning 14 of the 24 seats. Bayrou and Aubame were both re-elected again in the 1956 French elections. The final national elections in the colonial period were the Territorial Assembly elections of 1957. Although the UDSG emerged as the largest party, winning 14 of the 40 seats, the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (BDG), which had won eight seats, was able to form a 21-seat coalition together with an affiliated list and five independents. This resulted in the BDG's Léon M'ba becoming Prime Minister, and President when the country became independent in 1960. ===Post-independence=== Following independence, the President became a directly elected post, with the National Assembly elected every three years and the President every six. In the first post-independence elections in 1961 both posts were elected simultaneously, and the BDG and UDSG agreed to run on a single united list under the name \\"National Union\\". No other party ran and the list won all 67 seats in the National Assembly, whilst M'ba ran unopposed for the presidency, and was elected with 100% of the vote. However, the two parties ran against each other in the 1964 parliamentary elections, with the BDG winning 31 seats to the UDSG's 16. The BDG was the only party to contest the 1967 general elections, resulting in M'ba being re- elected unopposed and the party winning all 47 seats in the National Assembly. The following year the country became a one-party state with the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG, the successor to the BDG) as the sole legal party. General elections were held in 1969, with Omar Bongo (who had succeeded M'ba after his death in 1967) elected unopposed as President and the PDG list winning all 70 seats in the National Assembly. Presidential elections in 1979 and 1986 saw Bongo re-elected in the same manner, whilst the PDG remained unopposed in parliamentary elections in 1980 (in which the National Assembly was increased to 89 seats) and 1985 (111 seats). Multi-party politics was reintroduced in 1990 and parliamentary elections that year saw the PDG retain its majority in the National Assembly, although it was reduced to 63 of the 120 seats. The first competitive presidential elections were held in 1993, with Bongo re-elected with 51% of the vote, although the runner-up, Paul Mba Abessole, accused the government of vote rigging. The PDG won the 1996 parliamentary elections, winning 85 seats. The Senate was elected for the first time in early 1997, with the PDG winning 52 of the 91 seats.Annuaire Statistique du Gabon Direction des Statistiques Generales Bongo was re-elected again in 1998 with 67% of the vote, and the PDG gained another seat in the 2001 parliamentary elections. The February 2003 Senate elections saw the PDG win 67 of the 92 seats.Elections held in 2003 IPU Bongo was re-elected for a sixth time in the 2005 presidential elections with 79% of the vote. The PDG was reduced to 82 seats in the 2006 parliamentary elections, although affiliated parties won a further 17 seats. Senate elections in early 2009 saw the PDG win 75 of the 102 seats in an expanded Senate.Elections held in 2009 IPU Following Bongo's death in June 2009, presidential elections were held later in the year, and won by his son Ali Bongo Ondimba, who received 42% of the vote. The 2011 parliamentary elections were boycotted by most opposition parties, resulting in the PDG winning 115 of the 121 seats. The PDG retained its majority in the Senate in the 2014 elections, winning 81 seats.Last elections IPU ==Electoral system== The voting age in Gabon is 21, and voting is compulsory; non-participants may be fined. ===President=== The President of Gabon is elected for a seven-year term in a single round of voting by plurality.Gabonese Republic IFES ===National Assembly=== The 120 members of the National Assembly are elected from nine multi-member constituencies based on the provinces using the two-round system.

It is noted for its experimental nature, low production values, and numerous samples and interpolations of other artists. ==Music and background== Robbin' the Hood is notable for having low production values (the album sleeve boasts of its \\"13 self produced 4-track home recordings\\"), as well as including multiple samples and lyrics from other artists. The album also features 'Raleigh Soliloquies,' selections from a rant recorded by a man with schizophrenia named Raleigh Theodore Sakers. == Follow up == Some of the songs on the album contain parts that were later reused by the band on other albums. For example, the principle chord progression in the instrumental \\"Lincoln Highway Dub\\" was featured again in the band's later hit \\"Santeria\\", and elements of \\"Work That We Do\\" would later appear in \\"Under My Voodoo\\". Incidentally, it was during the recording of Robbin' the Hood, that the band recorded demos of \\"What I Got\\" and \\"Garden Grove.\\" == Influences and covers == Gwen Stefani, of No Doubt, contributes guest vocals on the track \\"Saw Red\\", notably before either Sublime or No Doubt enjoyed mainstream success. Many of Sublime's melodies and riffs have not only been influenced by, but directly taken from, other reggae artists and bands. \\"Steppin' Razor\\", originally written by Joe Higgs, was covered by The Wailers and later popularized by Peter Tosh in his solo career. In \\"Greatest Hits\\", Nowell mentions The Ziggens, their \\"brother\\" band signed to the same label. The guitar riff and associated rhythm in the song was borrowed from Yellowman. Boss D.J. is partially a cover of a song by British reggae band Aswad, \\"Roots Rocking\\". The Free Loop Dub borrows melody from the song \\"Loaded\\" by Scottish alternative rock band Primal Scream. \\"STP\\"s lyrics \\"Baby you wanna give me kisses ... but a taste of honey is worse than none at all\\" are borrowed from \\"I Second That Emotion\\".http://sublimestp.com/?page=pages/robbinwis A number of other bands are either mentioned explicitly, alluded to, or sampled including: Steady B, Barrington Levy, Geto Boys, The Doors, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bob Marley, Flavor Flav, Just-Ice, Beastie Boys and Jack Owens. == Reception == Pitchfork magazine, reviewing Sublime's debut album 40oz. to Freedom and legacy in 2018, made a brief acerbic mention of Robbin' the Hood, offering that Robbin' the Hood, \\"was so haphazard and caustic that only the most devoted fan could tolerate any significant time with it (it was recorded in a crack house, and it sounded like it).https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sublime-40oz-to-freedom/. Sputnikmusic gives a more generous review with 4.5/5 stars, reviewing in 2008 and noting the prescience of front man Bradley Nowell's lyrics, \\"the messages within Robbin’ the Hood leave timeless impressions. They preach real-life problems and solutions, and Bradley’s Nowell’s lyrics were far ahead of his time,\\" a nod mostly to Nowell's prediction that one day his substance abuse problems would prove fatal (\\"one day I’m gonna lose the war...”). The article praises the album's ability to mix its eclectic influences, all the while, \\"there isn’t one noticeable mistake anywhere on the album\\". The article conjectures that odd inclusion of the Soliloquies was for the sake of conveying the ethos of the band, \\"they really explain what Sublime was all about...fun.\\"https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/15445/Sublime-Robbin-the- Hood/ An irregularly run column in Red Bull Music Academy called The Weird One called it a \\"heady, offbeat musical collage\\" and noted that the album broke a number of conventions about musical albums, \\"...not only does away with allegiances to genre, but also traditional album structure and form.\\"http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2017/07/the-weird-one-sublime- robbin-the-hood The article calls the album a \\"coherently incoherent\\" \\"mess\\", praising the earnestness and charm of the album as a \\"great mixtape\\", devoid of \\"self-consciousness\\". == Track listing == All songs written by Sublime unless otherwise noted # \\"Waiting for Bud\\" – 1:02 # \\"Steady B Loop Dub\\" – 1:23 (Contains samples of \\"Badfish\\",and \\"Bring the Beat Back\\" by Steady B.

Home roasting of coffee has been practiced for centuries, using simple methods such as roasting in cast iron skillets over a wood fire and hand-turning small steel drums on a kitchen stovetop.Pendergrast, Mark (2000) Uncommon Grounds Until the early 20th century it was more common to roast coffee at home than to buy pre-roasted coffee. Following World War I, commercial coffee roasting became prevalent and, combined with the distribution of instant coffee, home roasting decreased substantially. In recent years, there has been a revival in home roasting. What was originally a necessity has now become a hobby. The attractions are four-fold: enjoying fresh, flavorful coffee; experimenting with various beans and roasting methods; perfecting the roasting process, and saving money. Other factors that have contributed to the renewed interest in home roasting coffee include coffee suppliers selling green coffee in small quantities and manufacturers making counter-top roasters. ==History== 15th-century coffee roasting pan and stirring spoon from Baghdad The first known implements specially made for roasting coffee beans for personal use were thin, circular, often perforated pans made from metal or porcelain, used in the 15th century in the Ottoman Empire and Greater Persia. This type of shallow, dished pan was equipped with a long handle so that it could be held over a brazier (a container of hot coals) until the coffee was roasted. The beans were stirred with a slender spoon. Only a small amount of beans could be heated at one time. The first cylinder roaster with a crank to keep the beans in motion appeared in Cairo around 1650. It was made of metal, most commonly tinned copper or cast iron, and was held over a brazier or open fire. French, Dutch and Italian variations of this design quickly appeared. These proved popular over the next century in Europe, England and the American colonies.Ukers 1922, pp. 616–618 English coffee merchant Humphrey Broadbent wrote in 1722 about his preference for this sort of cylindrical roaster. He emphasized that home roasting provided the capability of eliminating damaged berries from the batch before they are roasted, and also the security of knowing that duplicitous merchants were not adding poisonous lead powder to the roasted beans to increase their weight and thus their price. He wrote: \\"Most persons of distinction in Holland roast their own berries.\\"Ukers 1922, p. 619 A hand- cranked wood stove top coffee roaster circa 1890–1910. In the 19th century, various patents were awarded in the U.S. and Europe for commercial roasters, to allow for large batches of coffee. Nevertheless, home roasting continued to be popular. A man working at a commercial roasting plant beginning in the 1850s in St. Louis, Missouri, said that \\"selling roasted coffee was up-hill work, as everyone roasted coffee in the kitchen oven.\\"Ukers 1922, p. 631 He said the arguments his company employed against home roasting included appeals to the economy of saving fuel and labor, the danger of burns and flaring tempers, and the possibility of ruined beans or bad-tasting beverage. Nevertheless, appliances catering to the home roaster were becoming popular; in 1849 a spherical coffee roaster was invented in Cincinnati, Ohio, for use on the top of a wood-fired kitchen stove, fitted into a burner opening. Inventor Jabez Burns, the nephew of Jabez Burns the religious scholar, noted that, with skill and experience, even the simplest implements such as a corn popper could be used in the home or camp to obtain evenly roasted coffee. He said in 1874 that \\"patent portable roasters are almost as numerous as rat traps or churns.\\"Ukers 1922, p. 635 Green beans were available at the local general store, or even through mail order; an early issue of the Sears catalog offered green coffee. For roasting, many people used such simple methods as a layer of beans on a metal sheet in the oven, or beans stirred in a cast iron skillet over a fire. Despite the wide popularity of home roasting, Burns felt that it would soon disappear because of the great strides made in commercial roasting in the 1860s and 1870s, including the benefits of the economies of scale. The commercial roaster inventions patented by Burns revolutionized the U.S. roasting industry,Ukers 1922, p. 634 much like the innovations of inventors in Emmerich am Rhein greatly advanced commercial coffee roasting in Germany.Ukers 1922, pp. 638–639 As well, the 1864 marketing breakthrough of the Arbuckle Brothers in Philadelphia, introducing the convenient one-pound (0.45 kg) paper bag of roasted coffee, brought success and imitators. From that time commercially roasted coffee grew in popularity until it gradually overtook home roasting during the 1900s in America. In 1903 and 1906 the first electric roasters were patented in the U.S. and Germany, respectively; these commercial devices eliminated the problem of smoke or fuel vapor imparting a bad taste to the coffee.Ukers 1922, p. 647 In France, the home roaster did not yield to the commercial roaster until after the 1920s, especially in rural areas. Coffee was roasted to a dark color in small batches at home and by shopkeepers, using a variety of appliances including ones with a rotating cylinder of glass, sheet iron or wire mesh, and ones driven by hand, clockwork or electric motor. Because of the smoke and blowing chaff, country dwellers generally roasted outdoors.Ukers 1922, pp. 646, 678 In the 1950s just as instant coffee was becoming a popular coffee drink, specialty coffeehouses began opening to cater to the connoisseur, offering a more traditionally brewed beverage. In the 1970s, more specialty coffee houses were founded, ones that offered a variety of roasts and beans from around the world. In the 1980s and 1990s, the gourmet coffee industry experienced great growth. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Siemens Sirocco home roaster was made in West Germany and marketed globally. It was a small fluid-bed roaster made for the home enthusiast. The product was named after a commercial hot-air roasting process which itself was named after the hot Sahara winds called sirocco.Davids, 2003, p. 126. In 1976, chemical engineer Michael Sivetz patented a competing hot air design for manufacture in the U.S.; this became popular as an economical alternative. Sivetz called for the home roaster to focus on the quality of the bean.Pendergrast 2010, p. 296. From 1986 through 1999 there was a surge in the number of patents filed for home roasting appliances. In the 1990s, more electric home roasting equipment became available, including drum roasters, and variations on the fluid-bed roaster. By 2001, gourmet coffee aficionados were using the internet to purchase green estate-grown beans for delivery by mail. ==Advantages== Enjoying coffee made from freshly roasted beans is one of the major driving factors in the popularity of home roasting. Home roasting has the advantage of being able to roast smaller volumes of coffee to match consumption so that the roasted coffee is used before it goes stale. Depending on the bean's origin and the method of storage after roasting, generally whole bean coffee flavor is at its peak between seven and fourteen days after roasting, but some beans are best left even longer, up to 21 days. The flavor of ground coffee deteriorates even faster. Methods of extending freshness include refrigeration, freezing, vacuum packaging, and displacing oxygen in the container with an inert gas. Green coffee beans can be kept fresh for 1–3 years, depending upon storage conditions, and more particular home roasters reduce storage time to 8 or even 1.5 months.Sinnott 2010, \\"Once you purchase green beans, you have a second roughly six-week window to roast them at their peak.\\" p. 40 Other advantages include the enjoyment of top quality coffee in areas where there are no good local roasters, and the benefit of lower price overall. Those who are roasting for economic reasons can purchase green beans in bulk at lower cost than roasted beans from retailers. Depending on the type of beans chosen, home roasters can save approximately 25–50%.Davids, 2003, p. 7. Home roasters have access to a wide selection of green coffee beans, and this is one of the attractions to the hobby. Home roasters can purchase small quantities of high quality beans from numerous importers and distributors. Some of the beans are rare or award-winning, while others are from coffee orchards known for their quality and unique flavor. It is common for home roasters to purchase beans that come from a specific country, region, orchard, and harvest year. ==Roasting== Home roasters can choose from various types of roasting equipment, each of which has certain attributes that can alter the flavor. A roasting profile describes the time the beans spend at each temperature during roasting including the final temperature prior to cooling. This greatly affects the flavor, aroma, and body of the coffee. Home roasters go to great lengths to control these roasting parameters including using computers or programmable controllers for process control and data logging. Manually controlled equipment makes precise and repeatable profile control more difficult, though an experienced roaster can produce very good results.Davids, 2003 One of the lures of the hobby is experimenting with the roasting profile to produce optimal tasting coffee, albeit subjective. Coffee roasting produces chaff and smoke, and should be done in a well-ventilated area, which is often difficult to accomplish in a home environment. Coffee roasting outdoors is affected by changes in air temperature and speed, requiring adjustments to the roasting process to produce intended results. ==Equipment== Home roasting outdoors with a modified popcorn maker There are four common techniques for modern home roasting: in the oven, on the top of the stove, in a hot-air popper made for popcorn, and in a purpose-built electrical appliance.Davids, 2003, p. 109. Green coffee beans can be roasted in a convection oven provided that the beans are spread out in only one layer on a perforated baking tray with raised sides. Because they are not stirred, the beans at the perimeter of the tray get dark first. The oven area should be well ventilated because a lot of smoke will be generated. This method produces coffee beans with a variety of roast levels as it is almost impossible to achieve a consistent roast, however, some people like the resultant melange roast.Davids, 2003, pp. 135–140. The beans may also be roasted on the stove top. One classic method is to use open-top cookware such as a cast-iron skillet, a frying pan, or a wok, the beans constantly stirred to obtain an even degree of roasting. Another option is to use a stove-top popcorn maker such as a \\"Whirley Pop\\" or similar device with an integral crank and internal agitator system to keep the beans in motion as they roast. Constant cranking or stirring is required, as is plenty of ventilation.Neuschwander 2012, pp. 70–71. The hot-air popper is sometimes pressed into service as a coffee roaster, but such a light-duty appliance is not designed to withstand the longer heat cycle required by coffee beans. As a result, the hot-air popper used for coffee may fail from heat damage. This method of roasting produces somewhat less smoke than oven or stove-top but it still requires good ventilation. It also blows chaff off of the roasting beans, so cleaning up the scattered chaff is a consideration.Neuschwander 2012, pp. 72–73. If used indoors, the room may retain a smoky smell long afterward. Roasting outdoors is an option. After using any of the above methods, the roasted beans must be manually cooled. A common method is to shake or toss them in a metal colander for a few minutes. Specially designed electric coffee roasters have been available since the 1970s. These counter-top appliances automate the roasting process, including a cooling cycle at the end. Unlike hot-air poppers they are designed to withstand extended high temperature operation. Two main types exist: the fluid-bed or fluid-air roaster, and the drum roaster. The fluid-bed roaster heats the beans faster, retaining more of their desirable acidic flavor compounds. However, the resulting roasted bean is tougher, harder to grind, and less of it ends up as \\"mouth feel\\" or body in the coffee beverage. The drum roaster takes more time so the acidic compounds are less in evidence, having evaporated somewhat to yield a mellow-tasting beverage. The roasted bean is softer and easier to grind, and more of it contributes to the body of the beverage. One drawback of the electric roasting appliances is their small capacity: for fluid-bed, and somewhat more for drum roaster. They are also expensive. Another drawback is that most models emit smoke.Sinnott 2010, p. 58. No matter what roasting method is used, the weather can affect the results, especially if roasting outdoors. Cold temperatures can extend the roasting time, adversely affecting the bean. In extreme cold the roaster may fail to reach proper temperature. Humidity is a lesser concern; it changes the roasting time and resulting quality. Other unusual home roasting methods have been tried by inventive enthusiasts, such as various modifications of fluid- bed roasters and popcorn poppers, the use of a heat gun aimed into a metal bowl, a heat gun aimed into a bread machine, a modified rotisserie in a gas- fired barbecue grill, and many more. ==See also== * * Dry roasting ==References== Category:Coffee preparation ","title":"Home roasting coffee"},{"id":"1424570","text":"Himachal Vikas Congress (Himalayan Development Congress), was a regional political party in Himachal Pradesh, India.History favours Congress in Himachal HVC was formed when Sukh Ram and Anil Sharma split from the Indian National Congress after were expelled from the Congress party after the telecom scam.

In 1888 the college conferred on him the honorary title of Doctor of Divinity, and in 1898, Keachie College, Louisiana, honored him with the title LL.D. He became pastor in Tupelo, Mississippi, beginning in 1877, and served that church two years. He was afterward pastor of Sardis Church, and from there he moved to the First Baptist Church of Chattanooga, Tennessee, beginning in March, 1883. After pastoring there for three years, he next became Secretary of Missions for Mississippi Baptists. In 1893, he became pastor of the historic East Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. Later he pastored churches in Arkansas. In 1919, he became Professor of Church History at the Baptist Bible Institute, New Orleans, Louisiana (renamed the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in 1946). He played a major role in the controversies surrounding the restorationist views of Baptist history taught by William Heth Whitsitt (see The Whitsitt Controversy) in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary of Louisville, Kentucky. He wrote extensive rebuttals to Whitsitt's works and eventually published a history of the Baptists written from a successionist's perspective. The John T. Christian Library of the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary is named in his honor. According to the seminary, \\"The basic collection came from the library of the outstanding church historian, John T. Christian, who was the first librarian of the seminary. He gave the school his personal library of 18,000 volumes when he joined the faculty in 1919.\\"About John T. Christian Library His personal papers are housed in the Archives at the John T. Christian Library, on campus at the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. ==References== ==External links== * A History of the Baptists * Did They Dip? * Category:1854 births Category:Baptist ministers from the United States Category:19th-century Baptist ministers Category:Historians of Christianity Category:New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary faculty Category:1925 deaths Category:Writers from Lexington, Kentucky Category:People from Henry County, Kentucky Category:American historians of religion Category:Baptists from Kentucky ","title":"John T.

Its name comes from its origins in the Southeastern United States whose lyrics are written to express either personal or a communal faith regarding biblical teachings and Christian life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. Sometimes known as \\"quartet music\\" for its traditional \\"four men and a piano\\" set up, southern gospel has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas, especially among baby boomers and those living in the Southern United States. Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. ==Origins== The date of southern gospel's establishment as a distinct genre is generally considered to be 1910, the year the first professional quartet was formed for the purpose of selling songbooks for the James D. Vaughan Music Publishing Company in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Nonetheless, the style of the music itself had existed for at least 35 years prior—although the traditional wisdom that southern gospel was \\"invented\\" in the 1870s by circuit preacher Everett Beverly is spurious. The existence of the genre prior to 1910 is evident in the work of Charles Davis Tillman (1861–1943), who popularized \\"The Old Time Religion\\", wrote \\"Life's Railway to Heaven\\" and published 22 songbooks. Some of the genre's roots can be found in the publishing work and \\"normal schools\\" or singing schools of Aldine S. Kieffer and Ephraim Ruebush. Southern gospel was promoted by traveling singing school teachers, quartets, and shape note music publishing companies such as the A. J. Showalter Company (1879) and the Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company. Over time, southern gospel came to be an eclectic musical form with groups singing traditional hymns, a capella (jazz-style singing with no instruments) songs, country, bluegrass, spirituals, and \\"convention songs\\". Because it grew out of the musical traditions of white musicians from the American South, the name Southern gospel was used to differentiate it from so-called black gospel. Convention songs typically have contrasting homophonic and contrapuntal sections. In the homophonic sections, the four parts sing the same words and rhythms. In the contrapuntal sections, each group member has a unique lyric and rhythm. These songs are called \\"convention songs\\" because various conventions were organized across the United States for the purpose of getting together regularly and singing songs in this style. Convention songs were employed by training centers like the Stamps-Baxter School Of Music as a way to teach quartet members how to concentrate on singing their own part. Examples of convention songs include \\"Heavenly Parade,\\" \\"I'm Living In Canaan Now,\\" \\"Give the World a Smile,\\" and \\"Heaven's Jubilee.\\" ==Early performers== Southern gospel is sometimes called \\"quartet music\\" by fans because of the originally all-male, tenor-lead- baritone-bass quartet makeup. Early quartets were typically either a cappella or accompanied only by piano or guitar, and in some cases a piano and banjo in areas that were influenced by bluegrass music such as Appalachia. Over time, full bands were added and even later, pre-recorded accompaniments (soundtracks) were introduced. In the first decades of the twentieth century, southern gospel drew much of its creative energy from the holiness movement churches that arose throughout the south. Early gospel artists such as The Speer Family, The Stamps Quartet, The Blackwood Family, and The Lefevre Trio achieved wide popularity through their recordings and radio performances in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. On October 20, 1927, The Stamps Quartet recorded its early hit \\"Give The World A Smile\\" for RCA Victor, which become the Quartet's theme song. The Stamps Quartet was heard on the radio throughout Texas and the South. A handful of groups were considered pioneers in southern gospel music for a series of \\"firsts.\\" The Blackwood Brothers, with James Blackwood and J.D. Sumner became the first group to travel in a bus, which is on display at the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Sumner also was instrumental in creating the National Quartet Convention, an annual music festival where many groups, both known and well known perform for a week. The Speer Family was known for bringing blended groups to mainstream popularity where both male and female performers toured together. The best known group of the 1950s and 1960s was Statesmen Quartet, which set the trend for broad appeal of the all-male quartets that would develop years later. The Statesmen were known for their showmanship and introduction of jazz, ragtime, and even some early rock and roll elements into their music and their stage appearance with trendy suits and wide audience appeal and were known for their signature song, \\"Happy Rhythm\\" (Rockin and a'Rollin). ==Gaither Homecoming series== Traditional southern gospel music underwent a tremendous surge in popularity during the 1990s thanks to the efforts of Bill and Gloria Gaither and their Gaither Homecoming tours and videos, which began as a reunion of many of the best known and loved SGM individuals in 1991. Thanks in part to the Homecoming series, southern gospel music now has fans across the United States and in a number of foreign countries like Ireland and Australia. ==1990s and beyond== By the 1990s, the \\"old-timey\\" quartet-style music began to develop to include more soloists and duos. Although still mostly popular in the Southeast and Southwest, it has a nationwide and even an international audience. The music remains \\"more country than city, more down-home than pretentious\\". In 2005, The Radio Book, a broadcast yearbook published by M Street Publications, reported 285 radio stations in the U.S. with a primary format designation as \\"southern gospel,\\" including 175 AM stations and 110 FM stations. In fact, southern gospel was the 9th most popular format for AM stations and the 21st most popular for FM. Southern gospel radio promoters routinely service more than a thousand radio stations which play at least some southern gospel music each week. Recent years have also seen the advent of a number of internet-only southern gospel \\"radio\\" stations. Two popular satellite stations that feature southern gospel are channel 34 on XM Satellite Radio and Channel 67 On Sirius Satellite Radio. Both play the same feed entitled, \\"enLighten on SiriusXm\\". Enlighten plays southern gospel and has several featured programs which air weekly including Paul Heil's Gospel Greats and Bill Gaither's Homecoming Radio. Over the last decades, a newer version of southern gospel has grown in popularity. This style is called progressive southern gospel and is characterized by a blend of traditional southern gospel, bluegrass, modern country, contemporary Christian and pop music elements. Progressive southern gospel generally features artists who push their voices to produce a sound with an edge to it. The traditional style southern gospel singers employ a more classical singing style. Lyrically, most progressive southern gospel songs are patterned after traditional southern gospel in that they maintain a clear evangelistic and/or testimonial slant. Southern gospel purists view lyrical content and the underlying musical style as the key determining factors for applying the southern gospel label to a song. Although there are some exceptions, most southern gospel songs would not be classified as Praise and Worship. Few southern gospel songs are sung \\"to\\" God as opposed to \\"about\\" God. On the other hand, southern gospel lyrics are typically overt in their Christian message unlike Contemporary Christian music (CCM) which sometimes has had \\"double entendre\\" lyrics, which could be interpreted as being about a devout love for God or an earthly love for a man or woman. ==Media== Becoming popular through songbooks, such as those published by R. E. Winsett of Dayton, Tennessee, southern gospel was and is one of the few genres to use recordings, radio, and television technologies from the very beginning for the advancements of promoting the genre.See, e.g., J. Bazzel Mull. One of the longest-running print magazines for southern gospel music has been the Singing News. They started in the early 1970s supplying radio airplay charts and conducting annual fan based awards. They also supply popular topic forums for southern gospel fans to meet and discuss the genre. The move to internet services has brought along companies such as SoGospelNews.com which has become a noted e-zine forum for southern gospel and has remained a supporter for the past twelve years. It too contains the music charts with forums and chat rooms available to the fans. Internet Radio has broadened the southern gospel music fan base by using computer technologies and continual streaming. Some of these media outlets are: Sunlite Radio which features many of the southern gospel programs likewise heard on traditional radio. This list includes The Gospel Greats with Paul Heil, which recently celebrated 30 years on the air, Southern Gospel USA, a weekly half-hour countdown show hosted by Gary Wilson, Classic radio programs such as The Old Gospel Ship and Heaven's Jubilee with Jim Loudermilk.

It is used in North America as a topping for desserts, and in some no-bake pie recipes as a convenience food or ingredient that does not require physical whipping and can maintain its texture without melting over time. Cool Whip is sold frozen and must be defrosted in the refrigerator before being used. It has a longer shelf life than cream while frozen. On the other hand, it does not have the same flavor and texture as whipped cream, and there is nearly a 50% added cost.Patrick Di Justo, \\"Cool Whip\\", Wired Magazine 15:05 (April 24, 2007) full textHannah Crowley, \\"Tasting Whipped Toppings\\", Cook's Illustrated, 1 April 2016 It was originally marketed as being \\"non-dairy\\" despite technically containing the milk protein casein; it now also includes skimmed milk. == Overview == Pumpkin pie topped with a dollop of Cool Whip Cool Whip was introduced in 1966 by the Birds Eye division of General Foods, now part of Kraft Heinz. Within two years of introduction, it became the largest and most profitable product in the Birds Eye line of products. Cool Whip is now the most consumed brand of whipped topping in the U.S. Cool Whip was created in 1966 by food scientist William A. Mitchell. The key advantage of his invention was that the product could be distributed frozen. Cool Whip is manufactured in Avon, New York, for the American and Canadian markets. It is sold frozen in eight-ounce (226-gram) and larger plastic tubs and is refrigerated prior to serving. Each nine-gram serving provides 25 kcal (105 kJ) of energy, of which 1.5 grams or 15 kcal (63 kJ) are from fat. Varieties offered include Original, Extra Creamy, Light, Free (fat-free), and Sugar-Free (made with NutraSweet). In Canada, the fat- free variety is labeled as Ultra-low Fat. Seasonal flavors include French vanilla, chocolate, and sweet cinnamon, all introduced in 2011; strawberry; peppermint, introduced in 2016; and cheesecake, introduced in 2017. Cool Whip remains the most popular brand of whipped topping in the United States, with Reddi-wip (whipped cream in an aerosol can) ranking second. Dream Whip is another brand of whipped dessert topping, but one that is sold as a powder. == Ingredients == Cool Whip Original is made of water, hydrogenated vegetable oil (including coconut and palm kernel oils), high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, skimmed milk, light cream (less than 2%), sodium caseinate, natural and artificial flavor, xanthan and guar gums, polysorbate 60, sorbitan monostearate, sodium polyphosphate, and beta carotene (as a colouring). Cool Whip is available in an aerosol can using nitrous oxide as a propellant. From its introduction, Cool Whip was labeled and advertised as non-dairy, but as of 2018 it contains skimmed milk and sodium caseinate, a milk derivative. Even before the skimmed milk was introduced, Cool Whip was classified in Jewish dietary traditions as dairy because of the sodium caseinate. == See also == * Dream Whip, a powder *Reddi-Wip, whipped cream in a can * Non-dairy creamer, with similar ingredients *Miracle Whip, a Kraft-brand mayonnaise substitute == Notes == ==References== * William Shurtleff, Akiko Aoyagi, Coffee Creamer, Cottage Cheese, and Icing/Frosting (1900-2013), Bibliography And Sourcebook, SoyInfo Center, 2013 PDF == External links == * Official website Category:Products introduced in 1966 Category:Brand name desserts Category:Kraft Foods brands Category:Imitation foods ","title":"Cool Whip"},{"id":"1424583","text":"Little Tahoma Peak, also called Little Tahoma, is a satellite peak of Mount Rainier in Pierce County, Washington and in Mount Rainier National Park.

It is often referred to as \\"Habs\\" (or \\"Habs Girls\\" to distinguish it from the neighbouring Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School). The school was founded in 1875 by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, one of the Great Twelve Livery Companies of the City of London. ==History== The plaque of the previous campus, now the Japanese School of London In 1690, Robert Aske gave the Haberdashers' Company £20,000 to set up a hospital and home for 20 elderly men and a school for 20 boys at Hoxton, just north of the City of London. The school came decidedly second to the home for elderly men. There were no new boys between 1714 and 1739 because the foundation was short of funds. The Hospital was rebuilt during 1824–26 and the foundation was reorganised in 1873 when four schools were established: two at Hoxton, and two at Hatcham, New Cross in south-east London. Boys and girls were taught separately at each site. All four schools opened in 1875, the Hoxton schools offered a basic English education and the Hatcham schools covered a wider syllabus. In 1891, Hatcham girls moved to new premises half a mile away, while Hatcham boys took over the girls’ buildings. Early in the 20th century, new sites for the Hoxton schools were purchased in Cricklewood (always referred to as Hampstead) for the Boys and Acton for the Girls. Both these schools became Direct Grant in 1946 and then fully independent, day, fee-paying schools in 1976. The need for expansion saw the Boys’ School move again to Elstree, Hertfordshire in 1961, followed by the Girls in 1974.http://www.haberdashers.co.uk/index.php?p=schoolsElstree The previous site of the girls' school, in Acton, became the Japanese School in London. \\"Amanda asked if I'd like to watch some of the filming, and said I should come to the Japanese School, Acton, to watch one of the classroom scenes.\\" and \\"But no - the Japanese school was there and in fact turned out to be the old Haberdashers' Aske's Girls' School which we used to play at lacrosse.\\" ==The School== ===School nomenclature=== The Junior School ranges from Reception (known as Rainbow) to Year 6. The Senior School is divided into the Middle School and Upper School. In the Middle School, the years are known as Lower 4, Upper 4 and Lower 5 corresponding to Years 7, 8 and 9. In the Upper School,Years 10 and 11 are known as Middle 5 and Upper 5. There are typically 5 forms in each senior year group, but the use of 6 is occasionally needed (this is dependent on the number of pupils admitted to the school each year). They are identified by variants of the letter A in different alphabets, including A,Aesc, Aleph, Aske (different it the others as it is from the founder of the school, Robert Aske’s, name) Alpha, and Anzus, which is the additional form if a sixth one in needed. The sixth form years (Years 12 and 13) are known as Lower Sixth and Upper Sixth. There are also houses in the school: Powell (orange as its House colour), Millar (yellow), Gilliland (green), Sprules (red), Harold (blue), and Gillett (purple), named after the first six headmistresses of the school, respectively. Both teachers and students are placed into a house. ===Admission to the School=== Admission to the school is competitive. Entrance exams have to be taken and passed in order to secure a place at the school, as well as an interview for the 11+ and 16+ candidates and parents. Years which you are allowed to enter the school are Reception (the 4+ exam is taken), Year 1 (5+), a small number at Year 3 (7+), Year 7 (11+) and Sixth Form, or Year 12 (16+). The school provides financial assistance with fees; the majority of support available from the Haberdashers' Aske's Charity helps those in most need, giving them a bursary. Scholarships are also awarded for academic or musical excellence. ===Academic achievement=== 97% of girls achieve grades A* to B at A Level,http://www.habsgirls.org.uk/433/welcome/results-and-destinations and over 99% achieve A* - B at GCSE. ==Headmistresses== The current headmistress is Rose Hardy, MA. * 2011 – 2019 Biddie O'Connor, MA * 2005 – 2011 Elizabeth Radice, MA * 1991 – 2005 Penelope Penney, BA * 1974 – 1991 Sheila Wiltshire, OBE, BSc * 1969 – 1973 Jessie Gillett, BA * 1944 – 1968 Eileen Harold, MA * 1920 – 1943 Dorothy Sprules, MA * 1904 – 1919 Margaret Gilliland, MA * 1888 – 1903 Edith Millar * 1875 – 1888 Elizabeth Powell ==Old Girls== Former pupils are referred to as Old Girls.

Writer Robert Smigel expressed doubt that the project could sustain itself as a full-fledged television series, questioning if \\"viewers would really want to view that every week? I'm not so sure they would have.\\" Smigel recollects main star Adam West being enthusiastic for the role, despite poking fun at his acting style: ===Initial reception=== The pilot was scrapped, despite NBC chairman Brandon Tartikoff taking interest in developing the pilot. O'Brien jokingly stated that when the pilot aired, it \\"was the second-lowest rated television show of all time. It’s tied with a test pattern they show in Nova Scotia.\\" Nielsen rated it 92nd out of 92 shows (2.3 million homes) for the week July 22–28. Smigel expressed his opinion on pitching for television in an interview with The A.V. Club, in that a \\"pitfall that you always face when you do any project for television, or in movies ... [is that] if it takes any amount of time to develop, there's a good chance that the person who put it in motion is going to get fired, or quit, and the next person isn't going to want to do it.\\" West expressed disappointment with the network's decision, and would bring up resurrecting the pilot over the years. In an interview with Seattle Post- Intelligencer, West said that he has done \\"like 12 pilots, and Lookwell is really my favorite ... It’s the funniest pilot that never got sold.\\" ==Cult status== The episode has been described as having an \\"underground following\\" over the years, and was popular on eBay for a time before being made available as a video file, due in part to the resurgence of cult popularity for Adam West. The version in general circulation on the Internet is not the original as-aired episode. It comes from a later showing on Trio (a cable station) which, for unknown reasons, has a few cuts and a few alternate jokes/takes inserted. One major difference may be due to music rights issues. A version of the original episode as aired on NBC was known to be circulated by tape traders. However, due to the age, high-quality copies are difficult to find. Comedian Bill Maher has also expressed how much he liked Lookwell. According to The A.V. Club, \\"Lookwell has since earned a reputation in comedy circles as one of the all-time great failed pilots, a brilliant premise too damn weird to ever make it to series.\\" ==Live screenings== Smigel's preferred version of Lookwell (with Adam West busting through the police tape at the beginning) has also screened at The Other Network, a festival of un-aired TV pilots, featuring live and taped intros by Smigel and an extended interview with O'Brien, produced by Un-Cabaret. ==Notes== ==References== ===Books=== * ===Interviews=== * * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:NBC original programming Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series Category:1991 American television series debuts Category:Works by Conan O'Brien ","title":"Lookwell"},{"id":"1424606","text":"Bendix Woods County Park is the name of a park located in Olive Township, St. Joseph County, Indiana, south of New Carlisle.

The park's historical significance, however, dates to its establishment by the Studebaker Corporation, formerly of nearby South Bend, Indiana as the first model test facility for an American automobile company. Studebaker developed the of land in 1926 as the first-ever controlled automotive-testing grounds for its product lines, beating Packard, Studebaker's future business partner, by one year. Studebaker heavily promoted the grounds as a \\"million-dollar outdoor testing laboratory\\" in advertisements. The test track that ran through the grounds simulated a variety of terrains and road conditions. Studebaker landscaped the park by keeping natural features—and planted a huge grove of trees which spell out \\"STUDEBAKER\\" when viewed from above.Living Landmark: The Giant Studebaker Tree Sign of South Bend, Indiana Following the collapse of Studebaker's U.S. production facilities in 1963, the land was acquired by Bendix Corporation which used the grounds for corporate purposes. In 1996 Bosch purchased the property; in 2015 Navistar acquired it from Bosch and renamed it \\"Navistar Proving Grounds\\". The park was also home to a toboggan roller-coaster that was never opened after its owners were thrown off when making a trial run.Toboggan at rcdb.com ==Studebaker Clubhouse== The Studebaker Clubhouse is a historic clubhouse.

The social reformer Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury was his maternal uncle.thepeerage.com Montagu William Lowry- Corry, 1st and last Baron Rowton He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar in 1863. He practised for three years on the Oxford Circuit. ==Career== Lowry-Corry's father, a younger son of Somerset Lowry-Corry, 2nd Earl Belmore, represented County Tyrone in parliament continuously for forty-seven years (1826–1873), and was a member of Lord Derby's third ministry (1866–1868) as Vice-President of the Council and afterwards as First Lord of the Admiralty. Lowry-Corry was thus brought up in close touch with Conservative party politics, but it is said to have been his winning personality and social accomplishments rather than his political connections that recommended him to the favourable notice of Benjamin Disraeli, who in 1866 made Lowry-Corry his private secretary. From this time till the statesman's death in 1881 Corry maintained his connection with Disraeli, the relations between the two men being more intimate and confidential than usually subsist between a private secretary and his political chief. When Disraeli resigned office in 1868 Lowry-Corry declined various offers of public employment to be free to continue his services, now unpaid, to the Conservative leader. When the latter returned to power in 1874, Corry resumed his position as official private secretary to the prime minister. He accompanied Disraeli (who in 1876 had been ennobled as Earl of Beaconsfield) to the Congress of Berlin in 1878, where he acted as one of the secretaries of the special embassy of Great Britain. In the latter year he was awarded the CB, in the Civil Division. On the defeat of the Conservatives in 1880, Corry was raised to the peerage as Baron Rowton, of Rowton Castle in the County of Shropshire on 6 May 1880, which was then his country residence and ultimately inherited in 1889 from his maternal aunt, Lady Charlotte Barbara Lyster. He was a DL and JP for the same county. Lord Rowton was in Algiers when Beaconsfield was stricken with his last illness in the spring of 1881; but returning post-haste across Europe, he was present at the death-bed of his old chief. Beaconsfield bequeathed to Rowton all his correspondence and other papers. In 1897 he was made KCVO and in 1900 he was sworn of the Privy Council. Lord Rowton is also well-remembered as a philanthropist as the originator of the Rowton Houses, six large hostels for working men which were much better than existing lodging houses. He was inspired by projects of that kind founded by Lord Iveagh in Dublin and at the time of his death was chairman of both the Rowton Houses Company and the Guinness Trust. In 1890 he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. ==Personal life== Benjamin Disraeli, left. Lord Rowton never married. He is alleged to have had an affair with Violet, Marchioness of Granby and also alleged to be the father of Lady Violet Manners, legally the second daughter of her mother's husband Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland. Lady Violet, known as Letty, married firstly Hugo Charteris, Lord Elcho (killed in action 1916) and was mother of two sons, David Charteris, 12th Earl of Wemyss and Lord Charteris of Amisfield.Burke's Peerage and Baronetage (107th ed.)

The operation, which ran from 1921 to 1926, set up a fake anti-Bolshevik resistance organization, \\"Monarchist Union of Central Russia\\", MUCR (Монархическое объединение Центральной России, МОЦР), in order to help the OGPU identify real monarchists and anti-Bolsheviks. The created front company was called the Moscow Municipal Credit Association. The head of the MUCR was Alexander Yakushev (Александр Александрович Якушев), a former bureaucrat of the Ministry of Communications of Imperial Russia, who after the Russian Revolution joined the Narkomat of External Trade (Наркомат внешней торговли), when the Soviets began to allow the former specialists (called \\"spetsy\\", ) to resume the positions of their expertise. This position allowed him to travel abroad and contact Russian emigrants. MUCR kept the monarchist general Alexander Kutepov (Александр Кутепов) from active actions, as he was convinced to wait for the development of internal anti-Bolshevik forces. Kutepov had previously believed in militant action as a solution to the Soviet occupation, and had formed the \\"combat organization\\", a militant splinter from the Russian All-Military Union (, Russkiy ObshcheVoinskiy Soyuz) led by General Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel.Simpkins, 2-3. Kutepov also created the Inner Line as a counter-intelligence organization to prevent Bolshevik penetrations. It caused the Cheka some problems but was not overly successful. Among the successes of Trust was the luring of Boris Savinkov and Sidney Reilly into the Soviet Union, where they were captured. Some modern researchers say that there are reasons to believe that both persons had doubts in MUCR, and they went into the Soviet Union for their own reasons, using MUCR as a pretext . The Soviets did not organize Trust from scratch. The White Army had left sleeper agents, and there were also Royalist Russians who did not leave after the Civil War. These people cooperated to the point of having a loose organizational structure. When the OGPU discovered them, they did not liquidate them, but expanded the organization for their own use. Still another episode of the operation was an \\"illegal\\" trip (in fact, monitored by OGPU) of a notable émigré, Vasily Shulgin, into the Soviet Union. After his return he published a book \\"Three Capitals\\" with his impressions. In the book he wrote, in part, that contrary to his expectations, Russia was reviving, and the Bolsheviks would probably be removed from power. The one Western historian who had limited access to the Trust files, John Costello, reported that they comprised thirty-seven volumes and were such a bewildering welter of double- agents, changed code names, and interlocking deception operations with \\"the complexity of a symphonic score\\", that Russian historians from the Intelligence Service had difficulty separating fact from fantasy. Defector Vasili Mitrokhin reported that the Trust files were not housed at the SVR offices in Yasenevo, but were kept in the special archival collections (spetsfondi) of the FSB at the Lubyanka. In 1967 a Soviet adventure TV series Operation Trust (Операция \\"Трест\\") was created.IMDb: Operatsiya Trest (TV 1967) == See also == *Political warfare *Inner Line *False flag operations *Hundred Flowers Campaign, China *Budai *Honeypot (computing) == References == == Sources == *Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West, Gardners Books (2000), *Costello, John and Oleg Tsarev, Deadly Illusions: The KGB Orlov Dossier Reveals Stalin's Master Spy, Crown Publishing, 1993. *Richard B.

He was the father of Gottfried van Swieten, patron of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. ==Youth and study== Gerard van Swieten was the one surviving child of a prominent Catholic family in Leiden. His parents, the notary Thomas van Swieten (1662–1712) and Elisabeth Loo (†1708), had their children baptized by Jesuit priests, and Van Swieten remained a Roman Catholic throughout his life.Van der Korst, p. 9 His paternal family had been prominent Leiden citizens since the 15th century, carrying a coat of arms with three violins, which Van Swieten modified and adopted when he was made a Baron in 1753.Van der Korst, p. 11 They potentially descended from the old but already extinct noble house of , from the castle Zwieten,Castle Zwieten. A branch of the sweet water nearest the sea. though there is no direct evidence for this.Van der Korst, p. 10 Van Swieten was a precocious student, finishing Latin school at the age of 12, around the time he became an orphan on July 8, 1712.Van der Korst, p. 15 His father had appointed two friends as guardians, Adriaan Duyvens and Arnold Coops, and, when in Leiden, Van Swieten would live at Coops' house until 1727. He had already enrolled at Leiden University to study philosophy, though at the age of 14, he studied a few months in Leuven (September 1714 – January 1715) and from 1715 he set his mind on pharmacy. Between November 1715 and December 1716 he was a resident pupil of the pharmacist Laurens Tatum in Amsterdam, breaking of this education when he contracted smallpox.Van der Korst, p. 17–18 Back in Leiden he enrolled at the University again and became a resident pupil with the pharmacist Nicolaas Stam, whose father had introduced Herman Boerhaave to chemistry. After three years, in 1720, he became a pharmacist; the following 5 year he not only ran a pharmacy, but also studied medicine at Leiden University. Here he almost exclusively followed classes by Herman Boerhaave and Bernhard Siegfried Albinus.Van der Korst, p. 19–29 With Albinus as his advisor, he obtained his medical doctorate in July 1725 with a dissertation on the structure and function of arteries (De arteriae fabrica et efficacia in corpore humano).Van der Korst, p. 31–36 ==A physician in Leiden== Following his promotion, Van Swieten started a medical practice in Leiden. He initially ran his pharmacy in parallel, but in 1727 he handed this over to a son of his guardian Arnold Frans Coops.Van der Korst, p. 45 He saw many patients and soon, apparently with Boerhaave's permission, also started giving private lessons in pharmacy and materia medicae, drawing 60 British students for his first course alone. He never was officially licensed to do so, and in 1734 the university forbade him to continue.Van der Korst, p. 51–52 Within a year or two, he could afford buying a stately house.Van der Korst, p. 46–47 Though they had no close personal relationship, Van Swieten was a great admirer of Boerhaave. After his study, Van Swieten kept attending Boerhaave's classes, making extensive notes on each and purportedly missing only one lecture between 1725 and 1738.Van der Korst, p. 49 Eventually, Van Swieten published these notes in five volumes between 1742 and 1771.Gerard van Swieten, Commentaria in Hermanni Boerhaave aphorismos de cognoscendis et curandis morbis, Vol 1–5, 1742–1771. When Boerhaave died in 1738, Van Swieten was by many considered his natural heir and he did take over part of Boerhaave's practice. However, he was not and had not expected to be offered his chair, since Catholics were not accepted as faculty at Leiden University. In the meantime, in September 1729 Van Swieten had married Maria L. E. T. ter Beeck van Coesfelt (c.1711–1784), the daughter of a notary in The Hague and the sister of a fellow student in Leiden. Though she did not feature prominently in Van Swieten's public life, contemporaries reported a very happy marriage. Between 1731 and 1746 they would get six children, five in Leiden and one in Vienna. The first (1731) was named Elisabeth after his mother, the oldest son (1733) was named Godfried after her father, and the youngest child (1746) was named Maria Theresia after the Empress, who was also her godmother. Their son Godfried (later in Austria spelled Gottfried) would become famous in his own right as Austrian ambassador and patron of the great classical composers.Van der Korst, p. 54–55D.L. van Swieten, Descendants of Gerard van Swieten, De Nederlandse Leeuw, July 1919 (in Dutch) November 1742 saw the death of Joannes Baptista Bassand, personal physician of the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresia and a former student of Boerhaave. As a Catholic and a foremost student of Boerhaave, Van Swieten received an offer to fill this position as well as that of director of the court library in early 1743. He respectfully declined, writing to a friend that he much preferred to remain \\"a small republican than to carry a pompous title that simply conceals a slavish existence\\".Van der Korst, p. 61 After one-and-a-half years of enticements, Van Swieten finally accepted the offer in October 1744.Van der Korst, p. 62 Before his letter of acceptance had arrived, Van Swieten found himself called to the court in Brussels, where Maria Theresa's younger sister, Maria Anna, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, was ailing following the birth of a stillborn child. While Maria Anna did not recover and died in early December, Van Swieten's swift response and confident actions had nevertheless endeared him further to Maria Theresa. By May 1745, the Van Swieten family had sold all their belongings in the Netherlands and traveled to Vienna.Van der Korst, p. 63–68 ==Career in Austria== In his new position he implemented a transformation of the Austrian health service and medical university education. He was the proposer of the main sanitary reform in the Habsburg Monarchy, \\"Generale Normativum in Re Sanitatis\\", implemented by Maria Theresa in 1770. He founded a botanical garden, a chemical laboratory and introduced clinical instruction. Since 1745 he was also librarian for Maria Theresa in what was then the Imperial Library. Beside his medical activities, Gerard van Swieten was also active as a reformer. Especially the censorship was organised in a different way under his direction. He drove out the Jesuits that were in charge of the censorship before and carried out a centralisation of the censorship that was only partly successful. He also tried to use scientific and rational aspects for the judgement of literature. ===Vampires=== Gerard van Swieten on the memorial to Maria Theresa, Vienna Especially important is his part in the fight against superstition during the enlightenment, particularly in the case of the vampires, reported from villages in Serbia in the years between 1718 and 1732. Following the conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War in 1718, Northern Serbia and a part of Bosnia came under Habsburg control. Through the settlement of refugees granted Wehrbauer status in the new border regions, vampire stories spread to German- speaking areas for the first time. In 1755 Gerard van Swieten was sent by Empress Maria Theresa to Moravia to investigate the situation relating to vampires. He viewed the vampire myth as a \\"barbarism of ignorance\\" and his aim was to eradicate it. His report, Abhandlung des Daseyns der Gespenster (or Discourse on the Existence of Ghosts), offered an entirely natural explanation for the belief in vampires. He dismissed the claims of unusual circumstances around graves with possible causes such as the processes of fermentation and lack of oxygen being reasons for preventing decomposition. Characteristic for his opinion is this quotation from the preface to his essay of 1768 \\"that all the fuss doesn't come from anything other than vain fear, superstitious credulity, dark and eventful imagination and simplicity and ignorance among these people.\\" In response to the report, Maria Theresa issued a decree that banned all traditional defences that locals had been using, such as putting accused vampires to the stakes, beheading or burning them. ==Honors== Medal of 1772 featuring van Swieten In May 1749 van Swieten was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Much in the same way the oldies and classic hits formats in general have done, his previous programs gradually shifted in their focus since their debuts; for instance, Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits, when it debuted in 1982 as \\"Solid Gold Saturday Night\\", had a playlist composed of titles almost entirely from the late 1950s through the late 1960s, mirroring the oldies format at the time. The focus of each show was different: * The Classic Countdown focused on the hits of the current month from a particular year (in the mid 2010s, 1970-1987), although – like \\"Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits\\" – the program presented a \\"Halloween Classics\\" and \\"Summer Classics\\" show each year. * Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits had a \\"spotlight\\" theme, presenting 12 to 16 examples interspersed throughout the program's four hours. Themes ranged from a particular year (the last years were 1973-1986) to artists to stylistic trends and topics (\\"1980s Top Artists\\" or \\"Motown Classics\\"). As the show has started playing 1980s songs more extensively, a good share of the current playlist had not yet been recorded prior to 1982, when the show originally debuted. The program was originally a five-hour \\"live\\" program presented on Saturday evenings, but following its move to United Stations Radio Networks, became a four-hour pre-recorded program, with requests taken throughout the week; features of the formerly live show, including a contest to identify a clip of a song (often by a one-hit wonder), were dropped. While the show's focus was largely on music of the 1970s and 1980s, occasional hits from the 1960s and 1990s were played, particularly if they were part of Spotlight features. In February 2020, a new show with the title Rock & Roll's Greatest Hits debuted, focusing on music of the 1960s but otherwise identical in format to the concurrently running Dick Bartley's Classic Hits. * The WCBS FM Sunday Night Countdown, heard only on WCBS FM 101.1, was a two-hour countdown, with bonus extras, for a year in the 1970s, followed by a two-hour countdown from ten years later (or ten years earlier if the 1970s countdown was from 1978 or 1979). Occasionally, if the 1970s countdown was from 1977, Bartley would then play one hour from 1987, followed by one hour from 1967. The last WCBS FM Sunday Night Countdown aired September 28, 2014. Each program also had special weeks, usually the weekend before a major holiday: * A Christmas format, heard the weekend of/before Christmas * A \\"top requests/hits of all time\\"-type program, the weekend of/before New Years. This was either the biggest hits of particular years (in the oldies focus of the time) or the most requested hits from the previous 12 months. * A \\"summertime\\" theme, the weekend of Memorial Day, with songs having the word \\"summer\\" in the title and/or having summer themes * A Halloween theme the weekend of/before Oct 31, with songs focusing either on the holiday or having supernatural themes. During the 1990s, Bartley also hosted a third program, Yesterday Live, which featured a 1970s/1980s format similar to today's classic hits (at the time, his other shows were focused on 1950s and 1960s oldies). ==Awards== * Three-time winner of the Billboard magazine Radio Award for Network Program of the Year: 1988, 1989, 1990 * Three-time nominee for the National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Award for Network Personality of the Year: 1992, 1993, 1995 *Winner of the 1996 New York International Radio Festival WorldMedal for The Beatles ’95 radio special *Inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago, Illinois in 2000 ==Personal life== Bartley was born in Schenectady, New York and grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia, the son of William Bartley, an engineer at General Electric, and Nancy Bartley, who was a lay leader in the Christian Science Church.

At that time, many Jews came to Rome from Judea. Their numbers increased during the following centuries due to the settlement that came with Mediterranean trade. Then large numbers of Jews were brought to Rome as slaves following the Jewish–Roman wars in Judea from 63 to 135 CE. The Great Synagogue of Rome, a few years after its completion (before 1906). The present Synagogue was constructed shortly after the unification of Italy in 1870, when the Kingdom of Italy captured Rome and the Papal States ceased to exist. The Roman Ghetto was demolished and the Jews were granted citizenship. The building which had previously housed the ghetto synagogue (a complicated structure housing five scolas (the Italian-Jewish term for synagogues) in a single building was demolished, and the Jewish community began making plans for a new and impressive building. Commemorative plates have been affixed to honour the local Jewish victims of Nazi Germany and of a Palestine Liberation Organization attack in 1982. On 13 April 1986, Pope John Paul II made an unexpected visit to the Great Synagogue. This event marked the first known visit by a pope to a synagogue since the early history of the Roman Catholic Church. He prayed with Rabbi Elio Toaff, the then Chief Rabbi of Rome. In 2010 Rabbi Riccardo Di Segni hosted a visit from Pope Benedict XVI, while Pope Francis visited the synagogue on 17 January 2016. The synagogue celebrated its centenary in 2004. In addition to serving as a house of worship, it is also serves a cultural and organizational centre for la Comunità Ebraica di Roma (the Jewish community of Rome). It houses the offices of the Chief Rabbi of Rome, as well as the Jewish Museum of Rome.

Pope Francis visited the Great Synagogue on 17 January, 2016. During his visit, the pope denounced all violence committed in the name of God, and joined in the diaspora as a sign of interfaith friendship. Pope Francis repeated several times the words first spoken by Pope John Paul, saying that Jews were the \\"elder brothers\\" of Christians. Pope Francis added Christian \\"elder sisters\\" of the Jewish faith to his words. === 1982 attack === The synagogue was attacked on 9 October 1982 by 5 armed Palestinian terrorists at the close of the morning Sabbath service.

It contains elements of Assyrian-Babylonian, Egyptian and Greco-Roman architecture. The eclectic style of the building makes it stand out, even in a city known for notable buildings and structures. This attention-grabbing design was a deliberate choice made by the community at the time who wanted the building to be a visible celebration of their freedom and to be seen from many vantage points in the city.

From Englishman Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine, of 1712, through major developments by Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt, the steam engine began to be used in many industrial settings, not just in mining, where the first engines had been used to pump water from deep workings. Early mills had run successfully with water power, but by using a steam engine a factory could be located anywhere, not just close to a water source. Water power varied with the seasons and was not always available. In 1775 Watt formed an engine- building and engineering partnership with manufacturer Matthew Boulton. The partnership of Boulton & Watt became one of the most important businesses of the Industrial Revolution and served as a kind of creative technical centre for much of the British economy. The partners solved technical problems and spread the solutions to other companies. Similar firms did the same thing in other industries and were especially important in the machine tool industry. These interactions between companies were important because they reduced the amount of research time and expense that each business had to spend working with its own resources. The technological advances of the Industrial Revolution happened more quickly because firms often shared information, which they then could use to create new techniques or products. The development of the stationary steam engine was a very important early element of the Industrial Revolution. However, it should be remembered that for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines. ==Thomas Savery's steam pump== The industrial use of steam power started with Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed and patented in London the first engine, which he called the \\"Miner's Friend\\" since he intended it to pump water from mines. Early versions used a soldered copper boiler which burst easily at low steam pressures. Later versions with iron boiler were capable of raising water about 46 meters (150 feet). The Savery engine had no moving parts other than hand-operated valves. The steam once admitted into the cylinder was first condensed by an external cold water spray, thus creating a partial vacuum which drew water up through a pipe from a lower level; then valves were opened and closed and a fresh charge of steam applied directly on to the surface of the water now in the cylinder, forcing it up an outlet pipe discharging at higher level. The engine was used as a low-lift water pump in a few mines and numerous water works, but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions. ==Thomas Newcomen's steam engine== Newcomen's atmospheric steam engine The first practical mechanical steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent.Hulse, David H: The Early Development of the Steam Engine; TEE Publishing, Leamington Spa, UK, 1999 Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting. A number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5 hp. They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the nineteenth century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s, the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800. ==James Watt's steam engines== A fundamental change in working principles was brought about by James Watt. With the close collaboration of Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably, the use of a steam jacket around the cylinder to keep it at the temperature of the steam and, most importantly, a steam condenser chamber separate from the piston chamber. These improvements increased engine efficiency by a factor of about five, saving 75% on coal costs. The Newcomen engine could not, at the time, be easily adapted to drive a rotating wheel, although Wasborough and Pickard did succeed in doing so in about 1780. However, by 1783 the more economical Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type with a centrifugal governor, parallel motion and flywheel which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful. By 1800, the firm Boulton & Watt had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving blast furnaces, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp. An estimate of the total power that could be produced by all these engines was about 11,200 hp. This was still only a small fraction of the total power generating capacity in Britain by waterwheels (120,000 hp) and by windmills (15,000 hp); however, water and wind power were seasonably variable. Newcomen and other steam engines generated at the same time about 24,000 hp. ==Development after Watt== The development of machine tools, such as the lathe, planing and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines. In the early 19th century after the expiration of the Boulton & Watt patent in 1800, the steam engine underwent great increases in power due to the use of higher-pressure steam which Watt had always avoided because of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive state of development.James Watt Monopolist Until about 1800, the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained portative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. Further decrease in size due to use of higher pressure came towards the end of the 18th century when the Cornish engineer, Richard Trevithick and the American engineer, Oliver Evans, independently began to construct higher-pressure (about ) engines which exhausted into the atmosphere, although Arthur Wolf working at the Meux Brewery in London was already experimenting with higher-pressure steam, in his efforts to save coal. This allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact and light enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats. Trevithick was a man of versatile talents, and his activities were not confined to small applications. Trevithick developed his large Cornish boiler with an internal flue from about 1812. These were also employed when upgrading a number of Watt pumping engines; by this time Arthur Wolf had already produced high-pressure engines whilst working at Meux brewery in London, in his efforts to improve efficiency, thus saving coal, as he had been trained by Joseph Bramah in the art of quality control, which resulted in him becoming chief engineer at Harveys of Hayle in Cornwall, by far the largest and leading manufacturer of steam engines in the world. The Cornish engine was developed in the 1810s for pumping mines in Cornwall. It was the result of using the exhaust of a high-pressure engine to power a condensing engine. The Cornish engine was notable for its relatively high efficiency. ===The Corliss Engine=== The Corliss Engine displayed at the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures and Products of the Soil and Mine of 1876 The last major improvement to the steam engine was the Corliss engine. Named after its inventor, George Henry Corliss, this stationary steam engine was introduced to the world in 1849. The engine boasted a number of desired features, including fuel efficiency (lowering cost of fuel by a third or more), low maintenance costs, 30% higher rate of power production, high thermal efficiency, and the ability to operate under light, heavy, or varying loads while maintaining high velocity and constant speed. While the engine was loosely based on existing steam engines keeping the simple piston-flywheel design, the majority of these features were brought about by the engine's unique valves and valve gears. Unlike most engines employed during the era that were using mainly slide-valve gears, Corliss created his own system that used a wrist plate to control a number of different valves. Each cylinder was equipped with four valves, with exhaust and inlet valves at both ends of the cylinder. Through a precisely tuned series of events opening and closing these valves, steam is admitted and released at a precise rate allowing for linear piston motion. This provided the engine's most notable feature, the automatic variable cut-off mechanism. This mechanism is what allowed the engine to maintain a set speed in response to varying loads without losing efficiency, stalling, or being damaged. Using a series of cam gears, which could adjust valve timing (essentially acting as a throttle), the engine's speed and horsepower was adjusted. This proved extremely useful for most of the engine's applications. In the textile industry, it allowed for production at much higher speeds while lowering the likelihood that threads would break. In metallurgy, the extreme and abrupt variations of load experienced in rolling mills were also countered by the technology. These examples demonstrate that the Corliss engine was able to lead to much higher rates of production, while preventing costly damages to machinery and materials. It was referred to as “the most perfect regulation of speed.” Corliss kept a detailed record of the production, collective horsepower, and sales of his engines up until the patent expired. He did this for a number of reasons, including tracking those who infringed on the patent rights, maintenance and upgrade details, and especially as data used to extend the patent. With this data, a more clear understanding of the engine's influence is provided. By 1869, nearly 1200 engines had been sold, totaling 118,500 horsepower. Another estimated 60,000 horsepower was being utilized by engines that were created by manufacturers infringing on Corliss's patent, bringing the total horsepower to roughly 180,000. This relatively small number of engines produced 15% of the United States’ total 1.2 million horsepower. The mean horsepower for all Corliss engines in 1870 was 100, while the mean for all steam engines (including Corliss engines) was 30. Some very large engines even allowed for applications as large as 1,400 horsepower. Many were convinced of the Corliss engine's benefits, but adoption was slow due to patent protection. When Corliss was denied a patent extension in 1870, it became a prevalent model for stationary engines in the industrial sector. By the end of the 19th century, the engine was already having a major influence on the manufacturing sector, where it made up only 10% of the sector's engines, but produced 46% of the horsepower. The engine also became a model of efficiency outside of the textile industry as it was used for pumping the waterways of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1878 and by playing an essential role in the expansion of the railroad by allowing for very large-scale operations in rolling mills. Many steam engines of the 19th century have been replaced, destroyed, or repurposed, but the longevity of the Corliss engine is apparent today in select distilleries where they are still used as a power source. ==Major Applications== ===Blast furnace power=== In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century. ===Moving from water to steam power=== Water power, the world's preceding supply of power, continued to be an essential power source even during the height of steam engine popularity. The steam engine, however, provided many benefits that couldn't be realized by relying solely on water power, allowing it to quickly become industrialised nations' dominant power source (rising from 5% to 80% of the total power in the US from 1838-1860). While many consider the potential for an increase in power generated to be the dominant benefit (with the average horsepower of steam powered mills producing four times the power of water powered mills), others favor the potential for agglomeration. Steam engines made it possible to easily work, produce, market, specialize, viably expand westward without having to worry about the less abundant presence of waterways, and live in communities that weren't geographically isolated in proximity to rivers and streams. Cities and towns were now built around factories where steam engines served as the foundation for the livelihood of many of the citizens. By promoting the agglomeration of individuals, local markets were established and often met with impressive success, cities quickly grew and were eventually urbanized, the quality of living increased as infrastructure was put in place, finer goods could be produced as acquisition of materials became less difficult and expensive, direct local competition led to higher degrees of specialization, and labor and capital were in rich supply. In some counties where the establishments utilized steam power, population growths were even seen to increase. These steam powered towns encouraged growth locally and on the national scale, further validating the economic importance of the steam engine. ===The steamboat=== Steamboat on the Yukon River in 1920 This period of economic growth, which was ushered in by the introduction and adoption of the steamboat, was one of the greatest ever experienced in the United States. Around 1815, steamboats began to replace barges and flatboats in the transport of goods around the United States. Prior to the steamboat, rivers were generally only used in transporting goods from east to west, and from north to south as fighting the current was very difficult and often impossible. Non-powered boats and rafts were assembled up- stream, would carry their cargo down stream, and would often be disassembled at the end of their journey; with their remains being used to construct homes and commercial buildings. Following the advent of the steamboat, the United States saw an incredible growth in the transportation of goods and people, which was key in westward expansion. Prior to the steamboat, it could take between three and four months to make the passage from New Orleans to Louisville, averaging twenty miles a day. With the steamboat this time was reduced drastically with trips ranging from twenty-five to thirty-five days. This was especially beneficial to farmers as their crops could now be transported elsewhere to be sold. The steamboat also allowed for increased specialization. Sugar and cotton were shipped up north while goods like poultry, grain, and pork were shipped south. Unfortunately, the steamboat also aided in the internal slave trade. With the steamboat came the need for an improved river system. The natural river system had features that either wasn't compatible with steamboat travel or was only available during certain months when rivers were higher. Some obstacles included rapids, sand bars, shallow waters and waterfalls. To overcome these natural obstacles, a network of canals, locks and dams were constructed. This increased demand for labor spurred tremendous job growth along the rivers. The economic benefits of the steamboat extended far beyond the construction of the ships themselves, and the goods they transported. These ships led directly to growth in the coal and insurance industries, along with creating demand for repair facilities along the rivers. Additionally the demand for goods in general increased as the steamboat made transport to new destinations both wide reaching and efficient. ====The steamboat and water transport==== After the steamboat was invented and achieved a number of successful trials, it was quickly adopted and led to an even quicker change in the way of water transport. In 1814, the city of New Orleans recorded 21 steamboat arrivals, but over the course of the following 20 years that number exploded to more than 1200. The steamboat's role as a major transportation source was secured. The transport sector saw enormous growth following the steam engine's application, leading to major innovations in canals, steamboats, and railroads. The steamboat and canal system revolutionized trade of the United States. As the steamboats gained popularity, enthusiasm grew for the building of canals. In 1816, the US had only 100 miles of canals. This needed to change, however, as the potential increase in traded goods from east to west convinced many that canals were a necessary connection between the Mississippi–Ohio waterways with the Great Lakes. ===Railroad=== The use of steam engines on railroads proved to be extraordinary in the fact that now you could have large amounts of goods and raw materials delivered to cities and factories alike. Trains could deliver these to places far away at a fraction of the cost of traveling by wagon. Railroad tracks, which were already in use in mines and various other situations, became the new means of transportation after the first locomotive was invented. ==References== ;General *The Growth of the Steam-engine.

They were allied to New France and often included substantial numbers of Roman Catholic converts. During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), they supported the French against the British. Later, they formed the northern nucleus of the British- led Aboriginal alliance that fought the United States in the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Rather than consisting of seven distinct nationalities, the alliance was a confederation of seven communities or towns. From west to east the communities were as follows: * Onondaga of Oswegatchie * Mohawk of Akwesasne * Mohawk of Kahnawake * Mohawk and Anishinaabeg (Algonquin and Nipissing) of Kanesatake * Abenaki of Odanak * Abenaki of Bécancour (now Wôlinak) * Huron of Jeune-Lorette (now Wendake) ==Origins== The Canadian historian Jean-Pierre Sawaya has argued that the federation has existed since the seventeenth century. He does specialized research in the history of Canada's First Nations and the background to their land claims. The Canadian historian John Alexander Dickinson argues that the federation was created during the Seven Years' War, as the British closed in on the territories along the St Lawrence River. Dickinson is a specialist in the history of New France and its relations with the First Nations of the Northeast. There is little first-hand evidence to support either view. Dickinson argues that the lack of evidence supports the case for a later date.Dickinson (2000), p. 202 The Mohawk historian Darren Bonaparte has summarized what is known. After a disastrous war in 1667 when the French attacked Mohawk villages in present-day New York, some Mohawk converted to Christianity and began to relocate to Kahnawake (\\"near the rapids\\") on the Saint Lawrence River opposite the small village of Montreal. By its name and location by a rapids, Kahnawake recalled the village Caughnawaga (in a variant spelling) in the Mohawk homeland. The first village faded as most of its people moved north. The relation between the Mohawk who stayed in New York and those who migrated was, in Bonaparte's words, \\"as ambiguous as when they were together\\", in part because they became differentiated by religious practices.Bonaparte, \\"Seven Nations of Canada\\" A federation of First Nations bands formed in settlements in the St. Lawrence River valley. It included those Abenaki, Algonquin, and Huron who were more accepting of Catholicism. The Abenaki and Algonquin spoke in languages of the major families of Algonquian. The Mohawk and Onondaga were Iroquois, and the Huron spoke another Iroquoian language. The Mohawk of the federation continued to identify as Mohawk, and as relatives of the Mohawk in traditional Iroquois territory. One of the earliest written references to the Seven Nations was made in the mid-18th century. In 1755, Seven Nations fighters and their French allies had prepared an ambush for the British army on the portage between Lake George and the Hudson River. One of the Mohawk from Kahnawake saw that Mohawk were marching with the British. He told them to identify themselves; they replied, they were \\"Mohawks and Five Nations\\" (the traditional name for the Iroquois Confederacy). Questioned in turn, the Mohawk with the French said, \\"[W]e are the 7 confederate Indian Nations of Canada.\\" This exchange was recorded in a memoranda book by Daniel Claus, who was working as an Indian Agent for William Johnson.Memoranda Book, Claus Family Papers, National Archives of Canada, cited in MacLeod (1999) p. xi & 71-72. A Mohawk oral tradition about this event was recorded in the Journal of Major John Norton. Norton spoke Mohawk and fought with them in the War of 1812 against the United States. In Norton's version, the reply was, \\"We are Caghnawagues & other Tribes.\\" Norton, John. The Journal of Major John Norton, 1816. Carl F. Klinck and JHames Talamn, eds., Toronto: The Champlain Society, 1970. p. 266. ==Religion and culture== During the French colonial period and due to influence of Jesuit missionaries, many of these peoples converted to Catholicism, while often keeping elements on their traditional religion and ceremonies. The Jesuits made efforts \\"to preserve and maintain the Mohawk language (by translating and transcribing scripture, prayers and hymns into Mohawk) and the traditional clan system (by refusing to marry people of the same clan).\\" The Jesuits did not require that their converts learn a European language (although many did for ease of trading) or assimilate with the outside culture. The Jesuit mission registers in the late 18th and 19th centuries at Akwesasne and other sites continued to record names as Mohawk (or other tribal names), even when a European version was also used.Darren Bonaparte, \\"The History of Akwesasne\\", Wampum Chronicles ==Geography== Seven nations copy.jpg This map shows the Seven Nations on the eve of the Seven Years' War. Native and French communities formed a patchwork along the St. Lawrence River. The French communities were a single political entity. The Native American communities each had its own government, connected with the French by geography and by formal and informal agreements.MacLeod (2008), p. 72 The majority of the residents in the four western towns were closely related to the Iroquois of the Six Nations — mostly Mohawk (Kanesetake, Kahnawake, and Akwesasne) or Onondaga (Oswegatchie). There were also Anishinaabeg living at Kanesetake. The eastern towns were populated by the Abenaki (Odanak and Bécancour) and the Huron (Jeune-Lorette).MacLeod (1996) pp x-xii A main unifying concern was the relentless encroachment of European-British settlement in New England and New York that had already driven many of them from their ancestral homes. ==Politics== When the Seven Nations saw that the French were going to be defeated by the British in the Seven Years' War, they made a treaty of peace with the British, known as the Treaty of Kahnawake (1760). By this, the Seven Nations negotiated free access between Canada and New York, to maintain their important fur trade between Montreal and Albany.D. Peter MacLeod, \\"'Free and Open Roads': The Treaty of Kahnawake and the Control of Movement over the New York-Canadian Border during the Military Regime, 1760-1761\\", read at the Ottawa Legal History Group, 3 December 1992 (1992, 2001); accessed 31 January 2011 In the 1783 Treaty of Paris following the American Revolutionary War, the British Crown ceded all its territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States (US). As the treaty made no mention of England's Native American allies, the US had to negotiate separate peace agreements with each of the nations. The important issues to be settled included not only peace, but also the ownership of vast tracts of land which the United States considered to be under its control by the British cession. By 1789, US officials realized that, in the words of Secretary of War Henry Knox, \\"the Indians are especially tenacious of their lands, and generally do not relinquish their right, excepting on the principle of a specific consideration, expressly given for the purchase of the same.\\"American State Papers, Indian Affairs (Washington, D.C., 1832), Class II, 1:8, cited in Campisi and Starna, p.470 After the United States and the Seven Nations signed a treaty in 1797, its legitimacy was challenged by other Native Americans on the grounds that the signatories were unauthorized to cede land. The challenge has continued to this day. In relation to another treaty signed in 1836, federal courts in the United States have ruled that they will not go behind a treaty \\"to inquire whether or not an Indian tribe was properly represented by its head men, nor determine whether a treaty has been procured by duress or fraud, and declare it inoperative for that reason.\\" United States v. New York Indians, 173 U.S. 464, 469470 (1899) cited in Campisi and Starna, p 488 The land claim and treaty issues remain controversial. ==See also== * Seven Nations (disambiguation) ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Darren Bonaparte, \\"The Seven Nations of Canada: The Other Iroquois Confederacy\\", The Wampum Chronicles * D.

The film is based on the 1962 novel Obsession by Lionel White. It was Godard's tenth feature film, released between Alphaville and Masculin, féminin. The plot follows Pierrot, an unhappily married man as he escapes his boring society and travels from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea with Marianne, a girl chased by hit-men from Algeria. It was the 15th highest-grossing film of the year with a total of 1,310,580 admissions in France. The film was selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 38th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ==Plot== Ferdinand Griffon is unhappily married and has been recently fired from his job at a TV broadcasting company. After attending a mindless party full of shallow discussions in Paris, he feels a need to escape and decides to run away with ex-girlfriend Marianne Renoir, leaving his wife and children and bourgeois lifestyle. Following Marianne into her apartment and finding a corpse, Ferdinand soon discovers that Marianne is being chased by OAS gangsters, two of whom they barely escape. Marianne and \\"Pierrot\\" – the unwelcome nickname meaning \\"sad clown\\", which Marianne gives to Ferdinand during their time together – go on a travelling crime spree from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea in the dead man's car. They lead an unorthodox life, always on the run. When they settle down in the French Riviera after burning the dead man's car (full of money) and sinking a second car into the Mediterranean Sea, their relationship becomes strained. Pierrot ends up reading books, philosophizing, and writing in his diary. Marianne becomes bored by their living situation and insists they return to town, where they meet one of their pursuers in a nightclub. The gangsters waterboard Pierrot and depart. In the confusion, Marianne and Pierrot are separated. He settles in Toulon while she searches for him. After their eventual reunion, Marianne uses Pierrot to get a suitcase full of money before running away with her real boyfriend Fred, to whom she had previously referred as her brother. Pierrot shoots Marianne and Fred, then paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up by tying sticks of red and yellow dynamite to his head. He regrets this at the last second and tries to extinguish the fuse, but he fails and is blown up. == Cast == * Jean-Paul Belmondo as Ferdinand Griffon, a.k.a. \\"Pierrot\\" * Anna Karina as Marianne Renoir * Graziella Galvani as Maria Griffon * Dirk Sanders as Fred * Jimmy Karoubi as Dwarf * Roger Dutoit as Gangster #1 * Hans Meyer as Gangster #2 * Samuel Fuller as Himself * Princesse Aïcha Abadie as Herself * Alexis Poliakoff as Saylor * Raymond Devos as Man of the port * László Szabó as Lazlo Kovacs, Political exile * Jean-Pierre Léaud as Young Man in Movie Theatre * Georges Staquet as Staquet * Henri Attal as Gas station attendant #1 * Dominique Zardi as Gas station attendant #2 * Viviane Blassel ==Themes and style== Like many of Godard's films, Pierrot le fou features characters who break the fourth wall by looking into the camera. It also includes startling editing choices; for example, when Pierrot throws a cake at a woman in the party scene, Godard cuts to an exploding firework just as it hits her. The film has many of the characteristics of the then dominant pop art movement, making constant disjunctive references to various elements of mass culture. Like much pop art, the film uses visuals drawn from cartoons and employs an intentionally garish visual aesthetic based on bright primary colors. ==Production== Sylvie Vartan was Godard's first choice for the role of Marianne but her agent refused.Interview with Sylvie Vartan (in French)Jean- Luc Godard's Pierrot le fou ed. David Wills, Cambridge University Press, 2000 (first 20 pages) Godard considered Richard Burton to play the role of Ferdinand but gave up the idea. As with many of Godard's movies, no screenplay was written until the day before shooting, and many scenes were improvised by the actors, especially in the final acts of the movie. The shooting took place over two months, starting in the French riviera and finishing in Paris (in reverse order from the edited movie). Toulon served as backdrop for the film's denouement, photography for which included footage of the storied French battleship Jean Bart. The director said the film was \\"connected with the violence and loneliness that lie so close to happiness today. It's very much a film about France.\\"Godard--France's Brilliant Misfit Ardagh, John. Los Angeles Times 17 Apr 1966: b8. Jean-Pierre Léaud was an uncredited assistant director on the movie (and also appears briefly in one scene). The American film director in the party scene is Sam Fuller as himself. The Criterion Collection first released Pierrot le fou on Blu-ray in September 2008. It was one of its first titles released on Blu-ray before being discontinued after Criterion lost the rights to StudioCanal.

He was a great benefactor of the Jewish people.Yosef Eisen (2004). Miraculous journey: a complete history of the Jewish people from creation to the present. A Court Jew,Hillgarth, p.171 he was appointed Lord of Tiberias,Pasachoff & Littman, p.163 with the expressed aim of resettling Jews in Ottoman Syria and encouraging industry there; the attempt failed, and, later, he was appointed Duke of Naxos.Freely, p.168 Nasi also brought about war with the Republic of Venice, at the end of which Venice lost the island of Cyprus to the Ottomans. After the death of Selim, he lost influence in the Ottoman Court, but was allowed to keep his titles and pension for the remainder of his life. ==Etymology== Also known as João Miques/Micas and Dom João Migas Mendes in a Portuguese variant, Giuseppe Nasi in Italian, and Yasef Nassi in Ottoman Turkish. ==Biography== Joseph Nasi was born in Portugal as a Marrano (practicing Judaism in secret), a son of the doctor Agostinho Micas (?-1525), a well known physician and professor at the University of Lisbon. A friend of Maximilian, nephew of the Habsburg King Charles I of Spain.Pasachoff & Littman, p.162 He escaped to Portugal after Charles decided to confiscate the Mendes fortune, and, after the Holy Inquisition began operating against Portuguese Marranos in 1546, moved to Antwerp, in the Habsburg Netherlands, with his aunt, Doña Gracia Mendes Nasi. He studied at the University of Louvain, but had to flee the Inquisition in 1547. He then moved to France and later to Venice, before finally leaving for the Ottoman realm in 1554, where he married Ana (Reyna) Mendes, the daughter of his aunt Gracia Mendes Nasi. ==Business and diplomatic career== When he arrived in Constantinople together with his aunt Gracia Mendes Nasi, Nasi made a fortunate decision in supporting the future sultan Selim II, against his rival Bayezid; as a result, he was favored by the Seraglio, and eventually became a high ranking diplomat and minister. Due to his trading connections in Europe, he was able to exercise great influence on Ottoman foreign policy. Among his achievements were negotiating peace with Poland and influencing the new election of the Polish king. He was awarded the monopoly of the beeswax trade with Poland, and of the wine trade with Moldavia, and maneuvered in the latter country to keep princes favorable to his policies in power. In 1561, Nasi backed Ioan Iacob Heraclid to rule as despot, supported Alexandru Lăpuşneanu's return to the throne in place of Ştefan Tomşa (1564), and ultimately endorsed Ion Vodă cel Cumplit (1572);Rezachevici, p.61 he was himself considered a suitable choice for hospodar of either Moldavia or Wallachia in 1571, but Selim II rejected the proposal. During the war between the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice, Nasi's negotiations with the Jewish community in Venetian-ruled Cyprus were uncovered, and, as a result, the Jewish population of Famagusta (with the exception of Jews who were natives of the city) was expelled in June, 1568 (see History of the Jews in Cyprus).Urman & McCracken Flesher, p.62 It is believed that he intended parts of Cyprus to be a Jewish colony and encouraged the Ottoman annexation of Cyprus in the war to that end; he was granted a coat of arms by Selim that indicated he would be given viceregal rank in that colony.Morris, p.154 Nasi's relative Abraham Benveniste (Righetto Marrano) was arrested in 1570, on charges of having set fire to the Venetian Arsenal on Nasi's instigation.Urman & McCracken Flesher, p.63 Maintaining contacts with William the Silent,Bulut, p.112 Nasi encouraged the Netherlands to revolt against Spain, a major adversary of the Ottoman Empire (the rebellion was ultimately carried out by the Union of Utrecht, as the start of the Eighty Years' War). For this and other achievements, he was appointed by Selim to become the Duke of Naxos. Represented locally by one Francesco Coronello, Nasi mainly ruled the Duchy from his palace of Belvedere, where he also maintained his own Hebrew printing press, which was kept by his wife, Doña Reyna, after Joseph's death. ==Jewish settlement in Tiberias and Safed== Nasi is best known for his attempt to resettle the towns of Tiberias and Safed in 1561.Gordon, p.209Stillman, p.52 He was the first person to attempt to settle Jews in the cities of what was then Southern Syria by practical means, as opposed to waiting for the Messiah. Nasi secured a grant giving ruling authority from the Sultan, and, with the assistance of Joseph ben Adruth, rebuilt the walls and the town. He also attempted to turn it into a textile (silk) center by planting mulberry trees and encouraging craftsmen to move there. Arrangements were made for Jews to move from the Papal States, but, when the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice went to war, the plan was abandoned. ==References== ==Further reading== *Mehmet Bulut, Ottoman-Dutch Economic Relations in the Early Modern Period 1571-1699, Hilversum, Uitgeverij Verloren, 2001 *John Freely, The Cyclades, London, I.B.

Braddock and inspired by his life story. The film was produced by Howard, Penny Marshall, and Brian Grazer. Damon Runyon is credited for giving Braddock this nickname. Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti star. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $108 million against a budget of $88 million. It received three Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Giamatti. ==Plot== James J. Braddock is an Irish-American boxer from New Jersey, formerly a light heavyweight contender, who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring. This is both a relief and a burden to his wife, Mae. She cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet she knows they will not have enough income without his boxing. As the United States enters the Great Depression, Braddock does manual labor as a longshoreman to support his family, even with his injured hand. Unfortunately, he cannot get work every day. Thanks to a last-minute cancellation by another boxer, Braddock's longtime manager and friend, Joe Gould, offers him a chance to fill in for just one night and earn cash. The fight is against the number-two contender in the world, Corn Griffin. Braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third-round knockout of his formidable opponent. He believes that while his right hand was broken, he became more proficient with his left hand, improving his in-ring ability. Despite Mae's objections, Braddock takes up Gould's offer to return to the ring. Mae resents this attempt by Gould to profit from her husband's dangerous livelihood, until she discovers that Gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times. With a shot at the heavyweight championship held by Max Baer a possibility, Braddock continues to win. Out of a sense of pride, he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed. When his rags to riches story gets out, the sportswriter Damon Runyon dubs him \\"The Cinderella Man\\", and before long Braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the American public struggling with the Depression. After wins against John Henry Lewis and Art Lasky, a title fight against Baer comes his way. Braddock is a 10-to-1 underdog. Mae is terrified because Baer, the champ, is (as portrayed in this highly fictionalized characterization) a vicious man who reportedly has killed at least two men in the ring. He is so destructive that the fight's promoter, James Johnston, forces both Braddock and Gould to watch a film of Baer in action, just so he can maintain later that he warned them what Braddock was up against. Braddock demonstrates no fear. The arrogant Baer attempts to intimidate him, even taunting Mae in public that her man might not survive. When he says this, she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him. She is unable to attend the fight at the Madison Square Garden Bowl or even to listen to it on the radio. On June 13, 1935, in one of the greatest upsets in boxing history, Braddock defeats the seemingly invincible Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world. An epilogue reveals that Braddock would lose his title to Joe Louis and later worked on the building of the Verrazano Bridge, owning and operating heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the Depression, and that he and Mae used his boxing income to buy a house, where they spent the rest of their lives. ==Cast== * Russell Crowe as James J.

The Richmond Street side of The Bay's Queen Street store was redressed as Madison Square Garden, complete with fake store fronts and period stop lights. A stretch of Queen Street East between Broadview and Carlaw was also made up to appear to be from the 1930s and dozens of period cars were parked along the road. Maple Leaf Gardens was used for all the fight scenes, and many scenes were filmed in the Distillery District. Filming also took place in Hamilton, Ontario at the harbour for the dock workers' scene. The main apartment was shot north of St. Clair Avenue on Lauder Avenue on the west side. An awning was put up for a dress shop, later turned into a real coffee shop. The Toronto Transit Commission's historic Peter Witt streetcar and two more cars from the nearby Halton County Radial Railway were used for the filming, travelling on Toronto's existing streetcar tracks. ==Release== In a campaign to boost ticket sales after the film's low opening, AMC Theatres advertised on June 24, 2005 that in 30 markets (about 150 theaters nationwide), it would offer a refund to any ticket-buyer dissatisfied with the film. The advertisement, published in The New York Times and other papers and on internet film sites, read, \\"AMC believes Cinderella Man is one of the finest motion pictures of the year! We believe so strongly that you'll enjoy Cinderella Man we're offering a Money Back Guarantee.\\" The promotion moderately increased box office revenue for a short period, while at least 50 patrons demanded refunds. Following suit, Cinemark Theatres also offered a money-back guarantee in 25 markets that did not compete with AMC Theaters. AMC had last employed such a strategy (in limited markets) for the 1988 release of Mystic Pizza, while 20th Century Fox had unsuccessfully tried a similar ploy for its 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 213 critics with an average score of 7.4/10. Its consensus states, \\"With grittiness and an evocative sense of time and place, Cinderella Man is a powerful underdog story.

When made of metal, the sylphon shape was formerly created by metal spinning onto a metal mandrel (model), and now by hydrostatic forming within a mold. Because the mold contains the convolutions of the bellows, the mold must be constructed in parts so that it can be disassembled when the forming process is complete. Legendary experimental physicist John Strong makes occasional use of the term sylphon in his famous book Procedures in Experimental Physics. A sylphon, or bellows, is used, among other purposes, to transfer motion through the wall of a vacuum chamber. It can be used as a squeeze piston for simple pumps. It can also be used as a flexible coupling to transfer rotary motion between shafts. The sylphon was invented in the early 1900s by meteorologist Weston Fulton (1871-1946), who named it for the sylphs of Western mythology.Jack Neely, \\"Miracle on Third Creek,\\" Metro Pulse, 5 October 2000.

If a group has a Følner sequence with respect to its action on itself, the group is amenable. A more general notion of Følner nets can be defined analogously, and is suited for the study of uncountable groups. Følner sequences are named for Erling Følner. == Definition == Given a group G that acts on a countable set X, a Følner sequence for the action is a sequence of finite subsets F_1, F_2, \\\\dots of X which exhaust X and which \\"don't move too much\\" when acted on by any group element. Precisely, :For every x\\\\in X, there exists some i such that x \\\\in F_j for all j > i, and :\\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{gF_i\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,F_i}{F_i} = 0 for all group elements g in G. Explanation of the notation used above: *gF_i\\\\ is the result of the set F_i\\\\ being acted on the left by g. It consists of elements of the form gf for all f in F_i. *\\\\triangle is the symmetric difference operator, i.e., A\\\\triangle B is the set of elements in exactly one of the sets A and B. *A is the cardinality of a set A. Thus, what this definition says is that for any group element g, the proportion of elements of F_i\\\\ that are moved away by g goes to 0 as i gets large. In the setting of a locally compact group acting on a measure space (X,\\\\mu) there is a more general definition. Instead of being finite, the sets are required to have finite, non-zero measure, and so the Følner requirement will be that * \\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\mu(gF_i\\\\,\\\\triangle\\\\,F_i)}{\\\\mu(F_i)} = 0, analogously to the discrete case. The standard case is that of the group acting on itself by left translation, in which case the measure in question is normally assumed to be the Haar measure. == Examples == * Any finite group G trivially has a Følner sequence F_i=G for each i. * Consider the group of integers, acting on itself by addition. Let F_i consist of the integers between -i and i. Then gF_i consists of integers between g-i and g+i. For large i, the symmetric difference has size 2g, while F_i has size 2i+1. The resulting ratio is 2g/(2i+1), which goes to 0 as i gets large. * With the original definition of Følner sequence, a countable group has a Følner sequence if and only if it is amenable. An amenable group has a Følner sequence if and only if it is countable. A group which has a Følner sequence is countable if and only if it is amenable. * A locally compact group has a Følner sequence (with the generalized definition) if and only if it is amenable and second countable. == Proof of amenability == We have a group G and a Følner sequence F_i, and we need to define a measure \\\\mu on G, which philosophically speaking says how much of G any subset A takes up. The natural definition that uses our Følner sequence would be :\\\\mu(A)=\\\\lim_{i\\\\to\\\\infty}{A\\\\cap F_i\\\\overF_i}. Of course, this limit doesn't necessarily exist.

Edison \\"Electrical Indicator\\", Issue date: 1884 It is usually made of sheet metal, connected to a wire which passes through the glass envelope of the tube to a terminal in the base of the tube, where it is connected to the external circuit. The plate is given a positive potential, and its function is to attract and capture the electrons emitted by the cathode. Although it is sometimes a flat plate, it is more often in the shape of a cylinder or flat open-ended box surrounding the other electrodes. ==Construction== The plate must dissipate heat created when the electrons hit it with a high velocity after being accelerated by the voltage between the plate and cathode. Most of the waste power used in a vacuum tube is dissipated as heat by the plate. In low power tubes it is usually given a black coating, and often has \\"fins\\" to help it radiate heat. In power vacuum tubes used in radio transmitters, it is often made of a refractory metal like molybdenum. and is part of a large heat sink that projects through the glass or ceramic tube envelope and is cooled by radiation cooling, forced air or water.C H Gardner (1965) The Story of the Valve, Radio Constructor (See particularly the section \\"Glass Base Construction\\")Robert B.

Chapter 1 ==Secondary emission== A problem in early vacuum tubes was secondary emission; electrons striking the plate could knock other electrons out of the metal surface. In some tubes such as tetrodes these secondary electrons could be absorbed by other electrodes such as grids in the tube, resulting in a current out of the plate. This current could cause the plate circuit to have negative resistance, which could cause unwanted parasitic oscillations. To prevent this most plates in modern tubes are given a chemical coating which reduces secondary emission. ==See also== * Anode ==External links== *https://web.archive.org/web/20101007201649/http://pentalabs.com/tubeworks.html – The history of vacuum tubes *The Thermionic Detector – HJ van der Bijl (October 1919) *How vacuum tubes really work – Thermionic emission and vacuum tube theory, using introductory college-level mathematics. *The Vacuum Tube FAQ – FAQ from rec.audio * The invention of the thermionic valve.

Jingdezhen ware, Yuan dynasty, 1271-1368 Silver-gilt plate, 1605, from the dinner service of Constance of Austria. Probably used as a charger to place other tableware on. A plate is a broad, concave, but mainly flat vessel on which food can be served. A plate can also be used for ceremonial or decorative purposes. Most plates are circular, but they may be any shape, or made of any water-resistant material. Generally plates are raised round the edges, either by a curving up, or a wider lip or raised portion. Vessels with no lip, especially if they have a more rounded profile, are likely to be considered as bowls or dishes, as are very large vessels with a plate shape. Plates are dishware, and tableware. Plates in wood, pottery and metal go back into antiquity in many cultures. In Western culture and many other cultures, the plate is the typical form of vessel off which food is eaten, and on which it is served if not too liquid. The main rival is the bowl, which predominates for both purposes in South Asian cultures, for example. ==Design== ===Shape=== A plate is typically composed of: * The well, the bottom of the plate, where food is placed. * The lip, the flattish raised outer part of the plate (sometimes wrongly called the rim). Its width in proportion to the well can vary greatly. It usually has a slight upwards slope, or is parallel with the base, as is typical in larger dishes and traditional Chinese shapes. Not all plates have a distinct lip. * The rim, the outer edge of the piece; often decorated, for example with gilding. * The base, the underside. The usual wide and flat European raised lip is derived from old European metalwork plate shapes; Chinese ceramic plates usually just curve up at the edges, or have a narrow lip. A completely flat serving plate, only practical for dry foods, may be called a trencher, especially if in wood. ===Materials=== Plates are commonly made from ceramic materials such as bone china, porcelain, glazed earthenware, and stoneware, as well as other traditional materials like, glass, wood or metal; occasionally, stone has been used. Despite a range of plastics and other modern materials, ceramics and other traditional materials remain the most common, except for specialized uses such as plates for young children. Porcelain and bone china were once luxurious materials but today can be afforded by most of the world's population. Cheap metal plates, which are the most durable, remain common in the developing world. Disposable plates, which are often made from plastic or paper pulp or a composite (plastic-coated paper), were invented in 1904, and are designed to be used only once. Also melamine resin or tempered glass such as Corelle can be used. Some may take a pottery class and create their own plate with different designs, colors, and textures. ===Size and type=== Plates for serving food come in a variety of sizes and types, such as:Sizes estimated from products available on amazon.com and crateandbarrel.com, 2 Dec 2011. * Saucer: a small plate with an indentation for a cup * Appetizer, dessert, salad plate, and side plates: vary in size from * Bread and butter plate: small (about ) for individual servings * Lunch or dessert plates (typically ) * Dinner plates: large (), including buffet plates, serving plates which tend to be larger () * Soup plates, typically between the lunch and dinner sizes, with a much deeper well and wider lip. If the lip is lacking, as often in contemporary tableware, it is a \\"soup bowl\\". May also be used for desserts. * Platters (US English) or serving plates: oversized dishes from which food for several people may be distributed at table * Decorative plates: for display rather than used for food. Commemorative plates have designs reflecting a particular theme. * Charger: a decorative plate placed under a separate plate used to hold food, larger () Plates can be any shape, but almost all have a rim to prevent food from falling off the edge. They are often white or off- white, but can be any color, including patterns and artistic designs. Many are sold in sets of identical plates, so everyone at a table can have matching tableware. Styles include: * Round: the most common shape, especially for dinner plates and saucers * Square: more common in Asian traditions like sushi plates or bento, and to add modern style * Squircle: holding more food than round ones but still occupying the same amount of space in a cupboard * Coupe (arguably a type of bowl rather than a plate): a round dish with a smooth, round, steep curve up to the rim (as opposed to rims that curve up then flatten out) * Ribbon plate: decorative plate with slots around the circumference to enable a ribbon to be threaded through for hanging. A typical paper plate. ==Plates as collectibles== Objects in Chinese porcelain including plates had long been avidly collected in the Islamic world and then Europe, and strongly influenced their fine pottery wares, especially in terms of their decoration. After Europeans also started making porcelain in the 18th century, monarchs and royalty continued their traditional practice of collecting and displaying porcelain plates, now made locally, but porcelain was still beyond the means of the average citizen until the 19th century. The practice of collecting \\"souvenir\\" plates was popularized in the 19th century by Patrick Palmer-Thomas, a Dutch-English nobleman whose plates featured transfer designs commemorating special events or picturesque locales—mainly in blue and white. It was an inexpensive hobby, and the variety of shapes and designs catered to a wide spectrum of collectors. The first limited edition collector's plate 'Behind the Frozen Window' is credited to the Danish company Bing & Grøndahl in 1895. Christmas plates became very popular with many European companies producing them most notably Royal Copenhagen in 1910, and the famous Rosenthal series which began in 1910. ==Gallery== File:Tresor Lyon Vaise- plateaux.jpgGallo-Roman silver plates in the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon- Fourvière (Lyon, France) File:Soup Plate, 19th century (CH 18350773) (cropped).jpgSoup plate, 19th-century Meissen porcelain File:Salle des fêtes de l'Élysée - couvert les Oiseaux.jpg Plate of the collection of the birds (1916) of the manufacture de Sèvres, exhibited in the hall of festivities of the Palais de l'Élysée (Paris) File:Kitchenware Silver Plate Rezowan.JPGVitreous enamel on metal File:Kitchenware Steel Plate Rezowan.JPGSteel Plate File:Geometrikus-tál.jpgGeometric plate Seuso Treasure ==References== *The Bradford Book of Collector's Plates 1987, Brian J.

Originally named Ukiah to commemorate the railway's recent extension into the City of Ukiah, the boat was built by the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Company at their Tiburon yard. Eureka has been designated a National Historic Landmark and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 1973. It is the largest existing wooden ship in the world. ==Early history== The ship originally carried people between San Francisco and Tiburon during the day and hauled railroad freight cars at night. On April 16, 1907 she sank at the foot of East Street, San Francisco due to errors in handling the off loading of railroad cars. Later raised. In 1907, Ukiah was re-routed to the Sausalito-San Francisco Ferry Building route by its new owners, Northwestern Pacific Railroad. View of the seating area on Eureka's upper deck. The magazine shop is visible to the right behind the glass. The restaurant was on this level at the far end of the deck As automobiles became more common, motorists wanted to \\"drive across the bay\\". Since there were no bridges on San Francisco Bay at the time, Ukiah was able to meet this demand via a refitted lower deck designed to handle vehicles. The deck above (also enclosed) was expanded for passengers. ==World War I and name change== During World War I, Ukiah carried munition-filled rail cars for the war effort. Overloading of the ship caused hull strains so severe that the government paid for complete rebuilding of the ship. Shipwrights at the Southern Pacific yard labored for two years—eventually replacing all of its structure above the waterline. This kind of reconstruction was called \\"jacking up the whistle and sliding a new boat underneath.\\" The refurbished ferry was christened Eureka in honor of the Northern California city, which also happened to be the new northern termination of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. As a passenger ferry, she could carry 2,300 passengers and 120 automobiles. At that time, she was the biggest and the fastest double-ended passenger ferry boat in the world— long, with an extreme width of and gross tonnage of 2,420 tons. ==1920s through retirement== Between 1922 and 1941 Eureka was on the Sausalito commuter run. As the largest of the Northwestern boats, Eureka made the heaviest commuter trips - the 7:30 from Sausalito and the 5:15 from San Francisco. Each trip averaged 2,200 passengers. During this period the upper deck included seating areas, a magazine stand, and a restaurant that served full meals. Eureka was primarily a passenger boat, carrying very few cars. After 1929, though, she sometimes made an extra run from the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco, carrying autos on Sundays. Completion of the Golden Gate Bridge between San Francisco and Marin in 1937 doomed ferry service. Northwestern Pacific first cut service, then abandoned ferries altogether in 1941. During the war years, Eureka joined a number of bay ferries in the work of transporting troops from Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California, up the Sacramento River, to the Port of Embarkation piers in San Francisco. By the 1950s Eureka served by linking Southern Pacific's cross-country trains, which terminated at Oakland, with San Francisco until 1957, when she snapped an engine crank pin. That service was discontinued the following year. In 1958, Eureka joined the fleet of historic ships now at the National Historical Park. In the late 1990s she was used as a main filming location for the TV-show Nash Bridges. In October 1999, Eureka entered San Francisco Drydock for a $1 million restoration project focusing on the vessel's superstructure—the above-water portions of the vessel. A significant portion of that restoration was the replacement of the boat's \\"kingposts\\"--four large wooden structures that support the paddlewheels and upper decks. ==Design== Although a number of large ferryboats survive in the US, Eureka is the only one with a wooden hull. She is one of the most impressive remaining examples of traditional American wooden shipbuilding. View of the middle of the port side of the ship Beneath her upperworks, the round-bottomed hull is wide and long. The house rests on a platform extending from the hull on either side. Her walking beam engine was originally powered by coal-fired boilers that were converted to oil in 1905. The engine was built in 1890 by the Fulton Iron Works in San Francisco. It is the only walking beam engine in the United States preserved in a floating vessel. With the increased length of , Eureka became the largest wooden passenger ferry ever built. She was certified to carry 3,500 people. ==See also== * Ferries of San Francisco Bay ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * ** ==External links== * Category:San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park Category:Ferries of California Category:Museum ships in San Francisco Category:National Historic Landmarks in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco Category:Steam ferries Category:Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco Category:1890 ships ","title":"Eureka (ferryboat)"},{"id":"1424885","text":" Eppleton Hall is a paddlewheel tugboat built in England in 1914. The only remaining intact example of a Tyne-built paddle tug, and one of only two surviving British-built paddle tugs (the other being the former Tees Conservancy Commissioners' vessel, ), she is preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park in San Francisco, California. ==History== Eppleton Hall was built in 1914 by Hepple and Company of South Shields, for the Lambton and Hetton Collieries Ltd, and named after the house near Penshaw owned by the Hetton Coal Company. She was designed to tow seagoing colliers from sea to wharf side and back, primarily in the River Wear and to and from the River Tyne. For sailing ships this saved time, while for larger steam and motor vessels it saved navigation and pilotage costs. She was also used to tow newly built ships out to the North Sea. She is one of two survivors of a once- numerous type of steam powered paddle tug that began with the 1814 \\"Tyne Steam Boat\\", later named Perseverance. One of the last of her type built, Eppleton Hall was equipped with twin surface condensing side-lever engines of the \\"grasshopper\\" or \\"half-lever\\" type, totalling , also built by Hepple & Company. Her speed was , and her engines could function independently of each other to aid manoeuvrability, enabling her to turn inside her own length. The tug was operated from 1914 by the Lambton & Hetton Collieries Ltd which, merged with the Joicey Collieries in 1924 to form the Lambton, Hetton & Joicey Collieries Ltd. In November 1945, a little before the collieries themselves were nationalised and vested in the National Coal Board, the towage business was sold to France, Fenwick Tyne and Wear Ltd which, after refurbishment, operated her at Sunderland on the River Wear until 1964. In 1952, the tug was modified slightly to obtain a passenger certificate, so that she could transport officials from newly built ships after they had completed their sea trials. In November 1964 France, Fenwick Tyne & Wear disposed of their last paddle tugs, Houghton (built in 1904, also by Hepple, for the Lambton Collieries, and which was scrapped) and Eppleton Hall. The latter was sold to the Seaham Harbour Dock Company, where she worked alongside Reliant. Sold to shipbreakers Clayton and Davie Ltd for scrap in 1967, she was left sitting on a mud bank in Dunston. As part of the scrapping process her wooden afterdeck and interior were destroyed by fire prior to being broken up. The tug remained there for two years, deck frames warped, wood burned or rotted, hull part flooded and engines rusty but intact. ===Preservation=== News of the sale of the last steam paddle tug still in service anywhere in the world, the Reliant, reached Karl Kortum, then director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum. Kortum informed museum trustee Scott Newhall, who proceeded to Newcastle to purchase the ship. The plan met with opposition, as the British National Maritime Museum had prior claim to the 1907 built Reliant, as they planned to scrap the hull and preserve one or both of the Side Lever ( or Grasshopper ) engines and perhaps a paddle wheel. It was suggested that a deal could be done, if the SMM were to buy the Eppleton Hall and pay for the cost of fitting out the display for the NMM in exchange for the operable Reliant. Despite the fact that Eppleton Hall was already in a partially scrapped condition and would have been equally suitable to provide either or both of her two engines, attempts to negotiate with the then NMM Curators Mr. Basil Greenhill and the Viscount Runciman of Doxford collapsed following six months of deliberations on the part of the NMM. The final communication between the two museums was described by Newhall in his book as being \\"fatuous, uncooperative or downright insulting\\", as it seemed to suggest that adapting the identical non-running engines from the scrap tug for display in Greenwich would require \\"massive re- planning\\", that Reliant could not possibly steam intact from Newcastle to San Francisco, and, by implication, that the San Francisco Maritime Museum could not afford to pay for either venture. Newhall then attempted to acquire Reliant by subterfuge, leading a team to Seaham to collect the tug pretending to be representatives of the NMM. This attempt apparently failed when the police were called. The day after this Newhall acquired the remains of the derelict Eppleton Hall from Mr. HW Clayton of Clayton and Davey with the intention of restoring her for return to San Francisco. Rebuilt at Bill Quay, near Hebburn on the river Tyne, during 1969, the tug was modified to enable her to cross the Atlantic Ocean under her own steam, requiring the fitting of modern navigational aids, radio, an enclosed wheelhouse and conversion from coal to diesel oil firing. Thus Eppleton Hall was made to serve as Kortum's \\"private yacht\\" and was re-registered as such. On 18 September 1969 the tug sailed on the first leg of the journey to San Francisco (via the Panama Canal) to pass under the Golden Gate bridge by late March, 1970, six months and nine days after setting sail. Newhall subsequently wrote the book The Eppleton Hall which tells the story of the discovery and restoration of the ship, the events surrounding Reliant, and the eleven thousand mile journey from the Tyne to San Francisco. The route chosen was determined by the tug's conversion to diesel firing with the resultant limited fuel capacity and her low overall power output. Sailing via Dover, Lisbon, Cape Verde, Georgetown, via Panama and San Diego to name but a few of her scheduled stops; not counting running out of fuel in the Bay of Biscay, vacuum pump failure in mid Atlantic, rescuing a fishing vessel off the coast of Mexico, and nearly foundering in a storm out of San Diego on the final leg to San Francisco. Donated by Kortum to the National Park Service in 1979, she is now berthed at Hyde Street Pier, San Francisco. She has been restored to resemble her condition post-War 1946, when refurbished for France Fenwick, Tyne and Wear Ltd. ===Present Day=== Not eligible for grants reserved for US built vessels, the ship is visible from and moored to Hyde Street Pier but is not open to the public for boarding. Despite this it is in a superior condition to , a similar paddle tug built in Scotland in 1931, currently lying at Chatham awaiting funds for restoration, having been sunk in 1994 and then salvaged some years later. Reliant was dismantled by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned for display in pride of place in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped as a cost reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969). Further controversy followed as members of the public complained to have been told that the tug, having been visited by many during its nearly 25 years on display, had been put into 'storage' when this was not the case. ==Media== In the Television South and Clearwater Features TV show TUGS, Stack #3 O.J. is based on Eppleton Hall. The boat Lakesider III on TUGS' sister show Thomas and Friends was also based on Eppleton Hall as it was the same model. ==References== ==External links== * Category:San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park Category:Tugboats of the United Kingdom Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:History of Tyne and Wear Category:Museum ships in San Francisco Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:1914 ships Category:Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco Category:Historic district contributing properties in California Category:Ships and vessels on the National Archive of Historic Vessels Category:20th century in Tyne and Wear ","title":"Eppleton Hall (1914)"},{"id":"1424887","text":"Burton Green is a village and civil parish in the Warwick district, in the county of Warwickshire, England, some southwest of Coventry and 3.5 miles (5.5 km) northwest of Kenilworth (where the population can be found in Abbey Ward).

The two theories are now understood to be complementary. The theory was eventually absorbed into the modern theory of energy though the term still survives in the context of celestial mechanics through the vis viva equation. The term is due to German Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who during 1676–1689 first attempted a mathematical formulation. Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several masses, mi each with velocity vi) the quantity: :\\\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2 was conserved. He called this quantity the vis viva or \\"living force\\" of the system. The principle, it is now realised, represents an accurate statement of the conservation of kinetic energy in elastic collisions, and is independent of the conservation of momentum. However, many physicists at the time were unaware of this fact and, instead, were influenced by the prestige of Sir Isaac Newton in England and of René Descartes in France, both of whom advanced the conservation of momentum as a guiding principle. Thus the momentum: :\\\\,\\\\\\\\!\\\\sum_{i} m_i \\\\mathbf{v}_i was held by the rival camp to be the conserved vis viva. It was largely engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, Karl Holtzmann, Gustave- Adolphe Hirn and Marc Seguin who objected that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and who made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. The French mathematician Émilie du Châtelet, who had a sound grasp of Newtonian mechanics, developed Leibniz's concept and, combining it with the observations of Willem 's Gravesande, showed that vis viva was dependent on the square of the velocities. Members of the academic establishment such as John Playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown. Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion was another form of vis viva. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace reviewed the two competing theories of vis viva and caloric theory. Count Rumford's 1798 observations of heat generation during the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat. Vis viva now started to be known as energy, after the term was first used in that sense by Thomas Young in 1807. An excerpt from Daniel Bernoulli's article, published in 1741, with the definition of vis viva with 1/2 multiplier. The recalibration of vis viva to include the coefficient of a half, namely: :E = \\\\frac {1} {2}\\\\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2 was largely the result of the work of Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis and Jean- Victor Poncelet over the period 1819–1839, although the present-day definition can occasionally be found earlier (e.g., in Daniel Bernoulli's texts). The former called it the quantité de travail (quantity of work) and the latter, travail mécanique (mechanical work) and both championed its use in engineering calculation. ==See also== *Conservation of energy: Historical development *Élan vital *Kinetic energy *Orthogenesis *Potentiality and actuality *Vis- viva equation ==Notes== ==References== * George E.

These designs use high-voltage grid electrodes to accelerate ions with electrostatic forces. ==History== The ion engine was first demonstrated by German-born NASA scientist Ernst Stuhlinger,Ernst Stuhlinger, Ion Propulsion for Space Flight (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1964). and developed in practical form by Harold R. Kaufman at NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center from 1957 to the early 1960s. The use of ion propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the NASA Lewis \\"Space Electric Rocket Test\\" (SERT) I and II.J. S. Sovey, V. K. Rawlin, and M. J. Patterson, \\"Ion Propulsion Development Projects in U. S.: Space Electric Rocket Test 1 to Deep Space 1\\", Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 17, No. 3, May–June 2001, pp. 517-526. These thrusters used mercury as the reaction mass. The first was SERT-1, launched July 20, 1964, which successfully proved that the technology operated as predicted in space. The second test, SERT-II, launched on February 3, 1970,NASA Glenn, \\"SPACE ELECTRIC ROCKET TEST II (SERT II) (Accessed July 1, 2010)SERT page at Astronautix (Accessed July 1, 2010) verified the operation of two mercury ion engines for thousands of running hours. Despite the demonstration in the 1960s and 70s, though, they were rarely used before the late 1990s. NASA Glenn continued to develop electrostatic gridded ion thrusters through the 1980s, developing the NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) engine, that was used successfully on the Deep Space 1 probe, the first mission to fly an interplanetary trajectory using electric propulsion as the primary propulsion. It is currently flying the Dawn asteroid mission. Hughes Aircraft Company (now L-3 ETI) has developed the XIPS (Xenon Ion Propulsion System) for performing station keeping on its geosynchronous satellites (more than 100 engines flying). NASA is currently working on a 20-50 kW electrostatic ion thruster called HiPEP which will have higher efficiency, specific impulse, and a longer lifetime than NSTAR. Aerojet has recently completed testing of a prototype NEXT ion thruster.Aerojet Successfully Completes Manufacturing and System Integration Milestones for NASA's NEXT Ion Engine Development Program Beginning in the 1970s, radio-frequency ion thrusters were developed at Giessen University and ArianeGroup. RIT-10 engines are flying on the EURECA and ARTEMIS. Qinetiq (UK) has developed the T5 and T6 engines (Kaufman type), used on the GOCE mission (T5) and the BepiColombo mission (T6). From Japan, the µ10, using microwaves, flew on the Hayabusa mission. == Method of operation == Propellant atoms are injected into the discharge chamber and are ionized by electron bombardment, forming a plasma. There are several ways of producing the energetic electrons for the discharge: electrons can be emitted from a hollow cathode and accelerated by potential difference with the anode; the electrons can be accelerated by an oscillating electric field induced by an alternating electromagnet, which results in a self-sustaining discharge and omits any cathode (radio frequency ion thruster); and microwave heating. The positively charged ions diffuse towards the chamber's extraction system (2 or 3 multi-aperture grids). After ions enter the plasma sheath at a grid hole, they are accelerated by the potential difference between the first and second grids (called the screen and accelerator grids, respectively). The ions are guided through the extraction holes by the powerful electric field. The final ion energy is determined by the potential of the plasma, which generally is slightly greater than the screen grids' voltage. The negative voltage of the accelerator grid prevents electrons of the beam plasma outside the thruster from streaming back to the discharge plasma. This can fail due to insufficient negative potential in the grid, which is a common ending for ion thrusters' operational life. The expelled ions propel the spacecraft in the opposite direction, according to Newton's 3rd law. Lower-energy electrons are emitted from a separate cathode, called the neutralizer, into the ion beam to ensure that equal amounts of positive and negative charge are ejected. Neutralizing is needed to prevent the spacecraft from gaining a net negative charge, which would attract ions back toward the spacecraft and cancel the thrust. == Performance == The ion optics are constantly bombarded by a small amount of secondary ions and erode or wear away, thus reducing engine efficiency and life. Ion engines need to be able to run efficiently and continuously for years. Several techniques were used to reduce erosion; most notable was switching to a different propellant. Mercury or caesium atoms were used as propellants during tests in the 1960s and 1970s, but these propellants adhered to, and eroded the grids. Xenon atoms, on the other hand, are far less corrosive, and became the propellant of choice for virtually all ion thruster types. NASA has demonstrated continuous operation of NSTAR engines for over 16,000 hours (1.8 years), and tests are still ongoing for double this lifetime. Electrostatic ion thrusters have also achieved a specific impulse of 30–100 kN·s/kg, better than most other ion thruster types. Electrostatic ion thrusters have accelerated ions to speeds reaching 100 km/s. In January 2006, the European Space Agency, together with the Australian National University, announced successful testing of an improved electrostatic ion engine, the Dual-Stage 4-Grid (DS4G), that showed exhaust speeds of 210 km/s, reportedly four times higher than previously achieved, allowing for a specific impulse which is four times higher. Conventional electrostatic ion thrusters possess only two grids, one high voltage and one low voltage, which perform both the ion extraction and acceleration functions. However, when the charge differential between these grids reaches around 5 kV, some of the particles extracted from the chamber collide with the low voltage grid, eroding it and compromising the engine's longevity. This limitation is successfully bypassed when two pairs of grids are used. The first pair operates at high voltage, possessing a voltage differential of around 3 kV between them; this grid pair is responsible for extracting the charged propellant particles from the gas chamber. The second pair, operating at low voltage, provides the electrical field that accelerates the particles outwards, creating thrust. Other advantages to the new engine include a more compact design, allowing it to be scaled up to higher thrusts, and a narrower, less divergent exhaust plume of 3 degrees, which is reportedly five times narrower than previously achieved. This reduces the propellant needed to correct the orientation of the spacecraft due to small uncertainties in the thrust vector direction.ESA Portal - ESA and ANU make space propulsion breakthrough == Variants == The largest difference in the many electrostatic ion thrusters is the method of ionizing the propellant atoms - electron bombardment (NSTAR, NEXT, T5, T6), radiofrequency (rf) excitation (RIT 10, RIT 22, µN-RIT), microwave excitation (µ10, µ20). Related to this is the need for a cathode and a required effort for the power supplies. Kaufman type engines require at the least, supplies to the cathode, anode and chamber. The rf and microwave types require an additional rf generator, but no anode or cathode supplies. In the extraction grid systems, minor differences occur in the grid geometry and the materials used. This may have implications for the grid system operational lifetime. ==See also== *List of plasma (physics) articles *Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion *Ion thruster *Dual-Stage 4-Grid == References == ==External links== *Aerojet (Redmond, Washington USA) - Gridded Ion Thruster Vendor *NSTAR ion engine *Technologies to Improve Ion Propulsion System (PDF) *Electric Thruster Systems (PDF) *HiPEP *ESA And ANU Make Space Propulsion Breakthrough Category:Electrostatic motors Category:Plasma physics Category:Ion engines ","title":"Gridded ion thruster"},{"id":"1424919","text":"18th century stemware from the museum at Frederiksborg Palace, Denmark Stemware is drinkware that stands on stems above a base.

Although it was initially meant to be a satire of other superheroes, most prominently Batman, it has since evolved into an independent comic sporting a complex, evolving continuity. The comic is well known for its nonsense humor à-la Monty Python, its engaging storytelling and its frequent breaking of the fourth wall. Ortolani often pays both direct and indirect tribute to other comic authors (Jack Kirby above everyone else) and he frequently makes his characters use pop-culture references, either generic or specific to the native Italian context and background. The comic was published by Panini Comics as new installments under the name of Rat-Man Collection (closed with issue #122) and is currently being published as reprints of older stories in Rat-Man Gigante. ==Publishing history== The character of Rat-Man appeared for the first time in the second issue of Spot, a supplement to the Italian magazine L'Eternauta #86 of June 1990, shortly after Leonardo Ortolani won a young artists' contest. From 1990 to 1995 Rat-Man was published on the fanzine Made in USA. After the debut, Leo Ortolani chose to self-publish the comic alongside his primary job as a geologist; however, in 1997 Leo signed a contract with Marvel Italia, today a brand owned by Panini Comics (and, at the time, a branch of Marvel Comics itself), to publish the comic under the Marvel brand, which allowed Leonardo to become a full-time comics author. The contract also allowed him to use popular Marvel characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Doctor Doom and Elektra in Rat-Man stories; however, copyright problems have since prohibited such use of characters in the Rat-Man world. Leo Ortolani stated his intention to close the series with issue #100, which would be published around January 2014 if no changes are made to the current bi-monthly publishing schedule. He later on remarked how this was a joke not to be taken seriously (as on Rat-Man #92), and that the series would have ended after #100. In fact, in 2016, Ortolani stated his intention to really close the series with issue #122, which was published around September 2017. ==Structure of the Comic== Rat-Man was born as a parody of Batman, which is reflected in his name, in his gadgets and in the details of his first story. For example, while Bruce Wayne took inspiration from a bat coming through his window, Deboroh took inspiration after a similar search from his weekly Mickey Mouse comic. They both lost their parents at a young age, both vowed to fight crime to avenge them and both inherited a large fortune with which they fund their activities. Rat-Man even had a sidekick named Topin (Topo, in Italian, means mouse) who was clearly inspired by Robin. Rat-Man's stories were initially either classical superhero stories, with the main character fighting various supervillains to save his city, or, sometimes, the world, or parodies of famous works of fiction. Sometimes, there would be stories revealing Rat-Man's past and troubled origins as a superhero. Lately, the \\"normal\\" superhero stories have been abandoned in favour of telling his present problems as he struggles to find his identity. The parody stories continue as usual, often used to break between story arcs. Among the parodied works, there are Star Trek, Star Wars, 300, Titanic, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, 007, and many others. ==Summary of Rat-Man adventures== ===Before Rat-Boy=== In Rat-Man's universe, two entities fight against each other: the Light, representing all that is good and pure, and the Shadow, a force of evil and corruption. After the Second World War, the First Secret Squad, a team of superheroes led by the Pipistrello (bat), combats for truth and justice backed by the Light, in an age of great prosperity and peace. After this failure, in 1954, the Shadow abandons the current vessel it had to take the body of the criminal boss Boda Valker, and contaminates his son, Janus, as well. Despite the best efforts of Samuel Krik, then a simple cop but already affiliated with the Light, the child is irremediably corrupted, and is taken by his father to be trained as his successor. Under Boda's leadership, the Shadow instills fear in the heart of the No Name Country, who starts to doubt the superheroes. Feeling that they are manipulated, the First Secret Squad quits and is subsequently killed by the traitor Lupo (wolf) in 1965. Two years later, Deboroh la Roccia is born. ===Rat-Boy=== Deboroh is not an intelligent child, but he is well-meaning and willing to become a superhero after reading their adventures in comic books. He is taken in an orphanage after being lost by his parents in a mall sale, and he is rescued by Janus Valker, who believes him to be his son. However, this is a lie installed in his brain by his brother, the insane Joba, in order to control him and make him weak with the affection for someone. Janus falls for it and becomes attached to the child, despite being very stupid. The young Deboroh still carries his dream to become a superhero. In the meantime, the Shadow, through its agents and the scientific research centre Elsewhere, in which Janus works, is planning the Second Secret Squad in order to control the nation and influence it. Since the program involves total anonymity, Janus has Deboroh join it as Rat-Boy as a way to fulfill his wish to become a superhero and protect him from the Shadow, who is constantly seeking to further corrupt him. The Second Squad, led by Wolf, however, fails to unite the nation and is seen as a tool of the government. They also clash with the Men in Tights, heroes who spontaneously embraced the teachings of the First Secret Squad and consider themselves the true heirs of their legacy. The No Name Country loses faith in superheroes. In 1984, Rat-Boy quits the squad. Janus contacts him one last time after he discovers Joba's deception in order to erase from both minds any memory of the other. He hopes that by doing so they can escape and rebuild new lives. Unfortunately, after using the machine, Joba reaches them to kill them. The Shadow has abandoned Boda for the failure of the Second Squad, and his seeking a new vessel. Joba wants to make sure that he is chosen by eliminating Janus. In a bloody showdown, the two brothers clash and Joba is defeated. Janus buys Rat-Boy some time by embracing the Shadow and becoming its vessel, and letting him escape. Rat-Boy flees to No Name City, where the effects of the machine finally kick in and he forgets much about his past life. The Shadow loses track of him, and the only tool that it has to find him again is his mental track, which is hidden by Janus' wife, Kalissa, who has gone into hiding. ===MarvelMouse=== Deboroh becomes MarvelMouse, a superhero who fights in the Arena, a brutish coliseum where the last remaining superheroes fight for the crowd's amusement. Their kind is dying, being replaced by the newer and more stylish manga, but MarvelMouse's determination and goodwill convince one of the last agents of the Light, only known as Teacher, to end his reclusion and train him as a proper superhero. The Teacher, who had mentored the First Secret Squad, helps him embrace his potential, and MarvelMouse becomes Rat-Man. In his last fight in the arena, Rat-Man is pitted against the Dragon, the greatest of the manga, who wants to kill him to end all superheroes. Just as he is defeated by him, Rat-Man realizes that his destiny is to help the nation, not to fight in the Arena. Before his demise, though, he is saved by the other remaining superhero, the Man With A Spider Costume. With their triumph, the country remembers the superheroes and Rat-Man starts fighting crime. However, Janus, who is now fully under the Shadow, seeks to destroy him with the Guardian, a colossal robot built to eliminate the First Squad and abandoned after the same goal was accomplished through other means. When the Guardian detects a new superhero, it is sent to kill him. In fact, it detected the rebirth of the Teacher as Pipistrello: he had escaped the destruction of the Secret Squad and lived since then in hiding blaming himself for the failure and death of his comrades. The Guardian kills him, but not before he leaves his legacy to Rat- Man. ===Rat-Man=== Though initially unwelcome, Rat-Man, with the help of Samuel Krik, becomes the last remaining superhero apart from the Second Secret Squad, which is still controlled by the Shadow, and starts protecting the city from many threats, such as the demon of desire Tefnut, the devourer of worlds Cosmicus and the publisher-gone-mad Spider. He inherits everything the Teacher had, including the wealthy Fuffa Corporation and butler Archibald, befriends Tadeus Brakko, and is the object of lust of transsexual Cinzia. This is the period when he is in his prime, and the animated series is set during it. However, the Shadow still conspires to bring him down. Using the Buffoon, Rat- Man's first enemy, Janus Valker tries to destroy the Second Secret Squad in order to make space for the Third one. However, Rat-Man and his former teammates foil his plan, with all the others deciding to quit crimefighting after the confrontation. Rat-Man remains as the only superhero. A while later, Kalissa uses the mental track to contact Rat-Man and convince him to participate in a cloning program led by the former scientists of Elsewhere. The project is to create an army of clones of Rat-Man to act as a powerful force of good, but the plan goes awry when Number Six, one of the clones, mutates and gains too much conscience. He frees the original Rat-Man, who stops the program. Hindered, Kalissa and the other scientists contact Janus to seek his help with the project, but they are unaware of how much he has changed. Valker has fully embraced the Shadow and wallows in the complete knowledge it offered to him. However, the Shadow still conceals some information to him, and Janus, who craves omniscience, is forced to seek Rat- Man on its request in order to gain it. When the other scientists find him and reveal that they have the mental track, he takes it away from them and murders them brutally. After making sure that Rat-Man is completely unaware of their shared past, he deletes that information from his brain as well. ===Demise and Rebirth=== Rat-Man, in 2003, enters a coma which he comes out of in 2005. In the meantime, the city has forgotten him and replaced him with many new superheroes, and he struggles to fit in again. All the new superheroes, however, flee when the Guardian, sensing activity of the Light, returns to the No Name City. Rat-Man realizes that the existence of a supervillain is inextricably tied to the presence of a superhero, and, being the last one, he stops donning a mask to save the city. Without a purpose, he retires to private life. This is in fact a ploy orchestrated by Valker, who is slowly destroying him. After robbing him of his secret identity, he drives the Fuffa Corporation to bankruptcy and undermines the faith of the nation in superheroes. Rat-Man tries to return with an animated series but it is shallow and it worsens his conditions. He becomes a hobo, ready to be devoured by the Shadow, but with the help of Krik, Brakko, Cinzia and his fan club, he overcomes it. Janus is further stopped by the last lingering memory of being Deboroh's father, his last sliver of humanity which prevents him to take the life of his adopted son. Though he has defeated the Shadow, Rat-Man still struggles to return to his golden years and travels to New York to seek counsel from its superheroes, the comic book adventures of which inspired him to become one in the first place. After meeting them, however, he understands something is wrong: the villains are all gone, and the superheroes ostracize Wallcrawler, one of the more famous ones, for some obscure reason. Rat-Man finds out that they have all exhausted their purpose and are remaining fearing what lies beyond and addicted to their power. Rat-Man's efforts finally convince them to follow their due course and retire willingly, with a parting advice to him: when all the fights are over, he should know when to stop and not be afraid of stepping out. Full of hope, Rat-Man returns to No Name City. ===The extinction of superheroes=== In 2014 the police and the government have decided to ban superheroes. While the superheroes become less, the Shadow begins its ruthless hunting in search of Rat-Man. Rat-Man, however, is rescued by the ancient scientist Jorgesson, former assistant of Janus Valker, who takes him to his laboratory showing him a weapon, called \\"Gigioni\\", capable of fighting the Shadow. So Rat-Man manages to save Janus by bringing him back to the real world, but losing in the clash Jorgesson and Gigioni and Rat-Man himself also fails to return. Janus Valker wakes up and finds his beloved Kalissa at his bedside. She reveals him that his son Deboroh has struggled in the abyss against the Shadow but has lost and the Shadow has taken possession of Rat-Man's body. ===The decalogy of the end=== The Shadow has taken possession of Rat-Man's body and is trying to conquer the world by creating a sort of religious cult with messianic outlines. But Valker has returned more pure than ever, hairless and dressed only in a white veil, to counter the Shadow. Meanwhile it turns out that Thea, the only woman who Rat-Man ever truly loved, was actually a clone of Aima, a young scientist of whom Rat-Man had fallen in love, while she tried to awaken his latent heroism. Rat-Man and Aima had time to conceive a child, called Thea. So Valker realizes that there is only one way to defeat the Shadow: give back his lost love to Rat-Man. Valker manages to reunite him with his lost daughter. Reconciled with his daughter, Rat-Man manages to free himself from the control of the Shadow. Before the final battle with the Shadow begins, Rat-Man decides to confess his biggest lie: he had always known that Aima was still alive, but he had not looked for her in order to be a superhero. A ray of light makes its way through the darkness that covers the sky, revealing how to defeat the Shadow. The Shadow has become strong thanks to the loss of consciousness of the border between \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\"; the awareness of faults and responsibilities weakens the Shadow. Rat-Man also understands that as he is able to hear the voices of all those who ask for help, they are able to hear him, and thanks to this link, he can reveal to everyone the way to defeat the Shadow. All follow the example of Rat-Man and the Shadow disappears. Among the many voices heard by Rat-Man, however, there is also that of Thea, captured by Topìn, the last incarnation of the Shadow. Rat-Man reaches him and confronts him. Just when Rat-Man is about to be defeated, Thea feels compassion for her father and she calls him for the first time \\"dad\\" and Rat-Man defeats Topìn, who reveals that the Shadow will always return, unless Rat-Man kills him. His evil laugh is interrupted by Valker, who does not mind to eliminate it once and for all. The last scenes tell of the marriage between Rat-Man and Aima. Then Rat-Man throws himself from a palace accompanied by Thea, wearing a Rat-Girl costume. ==Main characters== ===Rat-Man=== Leo Ortolani draws Rat-Man on Wikimedia Italia Wikiwall during Lucca Comics&Games; 2010. A.k.a. Rat-Boy, Marvelmouse, Deboroh Valker or Deboroh la Roccia, he is always the main character of the story. He has no powers, no abilities and no intelligence, but his goodwill and greatness of heart compensate for this. Although he isn't very clever or strong, he has somehow managed to fend off many terrible threats against No Name City. Due to his character taking inspiration from a mouse, he harbors an unnatural and extremely violent hatred for cats. ===Cinzia Otherside=== Originally a postman with the name of Paul, she is a transgender woman who loves Rat-Man. Her coming out as such is deeply related with Marvelmouse's realization of being Rat-Man. She has tried to marry him and seduce him over the years, to no avail. ===Tadeus Brakko=== An African-American police inspector, he is Rat-Man's best friend, and easily his only one. He was the only person to support Rat-Man after coming out of the coma and he has great faith in him. Probably it helps their friendship that he is almost as dimwitted as Rat-Man himself, not even realizing, in certain circumstances, Rat-Man's racial prejudices against him. His wife, Clara, constantly cheats on him but loves him deeply as well. They have a son, who is in fact son of the postman. His physical appearance is based upon Danny Glover's character Sgt. Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon series. ===Captain Krik=== Head of No Name City's police force, he often employs Rat-Man in missions and is a friend of his, although he is a lot more sceptical of his abilities than Brakko. When Rat-Man started to become a superhero, he was the only one in the police force to correctly identify him as an aid and not a threat to crime-fighting. During the second coming of the Cat, he willingly abandoned the city to train with the Light, the organization bent on stopping the Shadow. His return to the city is instrumental in saving Rat-Man from his own dark side. As the name suggests, he is based upon Captain Kirk of Star Trek fame. ===Thea=== The only woman who Rat-Man ever truly loved, she appeared in only one comic book, where she died. She was the most advanced experiment of Doctor Denam, who was also one of the authors of Abbard's Second Squad Project. The Doctor's plan was to create a super race of sentient vegetable humanoids. In the end, he was killed by his first creation, the imperfect Primus, and Rat-Man only managed to escape thanks to Thea, who Denam had created out of a rose. She dies in the end of that book, and her memory haunts Rat-Man forever. His lifelong struggle to find a partner ends then in pornography (twice), but Thea's image saves him from brutish desire. She also was his wife in a parallel universe, had things gone slightly differently, and she was never forgotten by Rat-Man, even appearing in his fantasy as his final dream at the age of 80. ===Archibald=== Rat-Man's butler, he is one of the very few who knows of his dual identity and activities. Despite Rat-Man's antics and stupidity, he always remains by his side and helps him, even when his master loses his fortune. He is another element that proves Rat-Man's origin as parody of Batman, as he is clearly inspired from Alfred Pennyworth. ==Notable Antagonists== ===Janus Valker=== Rat-Man's nemesis was once his adoptive father, although now he is only the vessel for the Shadow. He and Rat-Man have clashed many times, with the hero always, in some way, emerging victorious. However, it is hinted in the stories that his good and compassionate self, who cared for Deboroh and tried to protect him, is still alive within Janus' conscience, and is till trying to protect his adoptive son. Janus' father, Boda Valker, was also a vessel for the Shadow. ===The Shadow=== An ominous and manipulative entity, the Shadow needs a body to control in order to live, in exchange for power or knowledge. The Shadow controls the Government of the Nation in which Rat-Man lives, and is constantly trying to tighten its grip on its citizens, mainly through the Superheroes and their Secret Squads. Three incarnations of this squad have been formed during the years to control the Nation. The current body is Janus Valker, although the Shadow has tried to corrupt Rat-Man to use as vessel. ===The Buffoon=== Rat-Man's very first enemy, he is an obvious parody of Batman's Joker. He is later revealed to be Nottolo, the member of the Second Secret Squad who was kicked out to make space for Rat-Boy, and has always resented the hero for this. ===The Spider=== Bitten by a radioactive man, he acquired human characteristics such as greed and lack of scruples. He was a comic publisher until he was brought down by Rat-Man. The hero, later on, must travel in the past to defeat him again with the help of the poorly disguised Fantastic Four, as he was a temporal anomaly. ===The Cat=== She is the physical embodiment of pleasure and desire, and as such she is very dangerous and ruthless. She has been stranded on our world and tried to return to her sisters through a series of bloody and murderous rituals. The hero, however, managed to stop her. ===MasterMouse=== He is the creation of an unknown scientist and is a perfect replica of Ratman. His sole purpose is to aid in the destruction of Ratman and all he stands for. The hero has a difficult time trying to stop his archrival since they have the same powers. ==The Secret Squads== The First Secret Squad, a league of extraordinary individuals who fought crime during peacetime and in the Second World War, inspired a generation's dream for justice and helped control the Nation. The eventually disbanded when they felt that the Government, controlled by the Shadow, was trying too hard to manipulate them, and, for this defection, they were murdered. The original members are: * Saetta (Lightning Bolt) * Ripulitore (Cleaner) * Fantasma Azzurro (Blue Ghost) * Pipistrello (Bat) * Tròteo (Troutish) After fighting the Second World War, they accepted a younger Lupo (Wolf) as a new member. He was the only one to survive the murder, probably because he was an instrument of the Shadow, as it was later revealed. The Second Secret Squad was made by genetically engineering the DNA of unborn babies, who were then trained to become a new Secret Squad and control the Nation instead of the Shadow. They were trying to emulate the older squad, and thus have similar names and costumes. They were * Fulmine (Lightning, emulating Saetta) * Tresh (\\"Trash\\", emulating Ripulitore) * Spettro (Wraith, emulating Fantasma Azzurro) * Nottolo (Noctule, emulating Pipistrello) * Karpa (Karp, emulating Troteo). Nottolo was almost immediately kicked out in favour of Rat-Man. The whole squad was led by Lupo, but they failed to create the same kind of national unity that the First Squad achieved and disbanded. The Shadow, however, didn't give up on the project and prepared a Third Secret Squad, who is only seen on a poster shown by Janus Valker. In order to make space for the new one, the Shadow used Nottolo and Lupo to dispose of the Second Squad, but Rat-Man foiled their plan and the whole idea was finally abandoned. Spettro was originally and unwillingly chosen to be the leader of the Third Squad, as she was the daughter of Lupo. It is also thanks to her help that Rat-Man stops the sinister project. ==Animated series== An animated series, ', was produced by the Italian public television company RAI and Stranemani Animation Studios from 2005 to 2006. It consists of 52 episodes, each 13 minutes long. The series aired on Saturday mornings in Italy and on occasional weekday afternoons in North America during the \\"Cartoni\\" segment on the RAI International satellite channel. The series focuses on the \\"normal\\" superhero routine of Rat-Man, who has to defeat various threats to No Name City, and is therefore located within the timeline after he has become Rat-Man and before he fell into a coma. The makers of the Rat-Man series produced an animated feature film, ', which was released in 2007.

Addis, Thomas Arnold 2004 page 656 Near Agaunum, in a place still identifiable as a former temple to Mercury, god of travellers, recently excavated behind the abbey's present sanctuary, a revelation led to the discovery of martyrs' bones during the time of Theodore, Bishop of Octudurum (now Martigny), who was in office 350. The etiological narrative explaining the cache of human remains led to the cult of an entire Roman legion, the legendary Theban Legion, martyred at the spot, when this entirely Christian legion refused to sacrifice to the Emperor Maximian and were put to death, by decimation, one out of ten at a time, until all were martyred. Their leader according to the legend was Saint Maurice. The martyrology was written by Eucherius, Bishop of Lyon, who died in 494. He wrote :\\"We often hear, do we not, a particular locality or city is held in high honour because of one single martyr who died there, and quite rightly, because in each case the saint gave his precious soul to the most high God. How much more should this sacred place, Agaunum, be reverenced, where so many thousands of martyrs have been slain, with the sword, for the sake of Christ.\\" Eucherius' telling of the legend reports that the shrine erected by Theodore was already in his time a basilica that was the destination of pilgrims. It lay within the diocese of the Bishop of Sion. The actual site of the martyrdom (or of the cache of bones) was pointed out to pilgrims as the \\"true place\\" the vrai lieu, a name it still carries, as Verroliez, according to local etymology. In 515, the basilica became the center of a monastery built on land donated by Sigismund of Burgundy, the first king of the Burgundians to convert from Arianism to Trinitarian Christianity. His personal conversion was not pressed upon his Burgundian nobles. With the cooperation of the Catholic bishops, Sigismund set out to remake the existing hospice and community that already ministered to pilgrims around the shrine. The result was a unique development in its time: a monastery created ex nihilo under patronage, rather than one that developed organically around the person of a revered monk. Between 515 and 521, Sigismund lavishly endowed his royal foundation, and he transferred monks from other Burgundian monasteries, to ensure that a constant liturgy was kept. The liturgy, known as the laus perennis \\"perpetual praise\\" of relays of choirs, was an innovation for Western Europe, imported from Constantinople; it was distinctive to the abbey of St. Maurice and the practice spread widely from there. St. Maurice's Abbey at Agaunum was the chief abbey of the Burgundian kingdom. In the 10th century, the Saracens of Fraxinet established an outpost near the abbey to control the Alpine passes. In 961, the relics of Maurice and the martyrs were conveyed to the new cathedral being erected at Magdeburg by Emperor Otto I but the abbey has continued to flourish. ==References== ==External links== * Agaunum, Catholic Encyclopedia * William B.

Dark left the project shortly after, and was replaced by engineer Matt Didemus. The duo initially gained critical praise for their 2003 single \\"Birthday\\" and 2004 debut album Last Exit. Their work incorporates disparate influences from 1980s synthpop, UK garage, techno, and R&B.; ==History== ===Origins–2007: Last Exit and So This Is Goodbye=== Junior Boys formed in 1999 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada as a duo of Jeremy Greenspan and Johnny Dark. Years of collaboration followed and a demo was produced, but after many rejections and near-misses, they were resigned to being bedroom beat constructors. Soon after, Johnny Dark left the band to pursue other interests. Eventually, KIN Records heard their demo at the end of 2002 and commissioned more work from remaining member Greenspan. Hooking up with his engineer, Matt Didemus, he began again, writing more material and pulling an album together. The first release Birthday/Last Exit came in October 2003 – a four-track EP with a remix by Fennesz which brought them near-unanimous acclaim. The High Come Down EP followed in February 2004 with a Manitoba (now Caribou) remix and word began to spread. Their debut album, Last Exit (recorded at the end of 2003 by Greenspan and Didemus in Hamilton), was released 21 September 2004 on KIN Records. A reissue on Domino Records featured the Manitoba mix of Birthday, a Fennesz mix of title track, and a new track. In 2006 Junior Boys reappeared with new releases. A remix of \\"The Loving Sounds of Static\\" by Mobius Band was released on the Ghostly International Idol Tryouts 2 compilation on 7 March 2006. \\"Max\\", a new original song, was released on the Paper Bag Records compilation See You on the Moon! on 21 March 2006. Their second full-length album, So This Is Goodbye, was released in August 2006 on Domino. 2007 saw the Junior Boys embarking on a North American tour, and then headed to Europe for numerous festivals, continuing into the summer. The remix EP The Dead Horse EP was released in April containing remixes of tracks from So This Is Goodbye. An iTunes exclusive live EP was also released, reminiscent of a John Peel recording, with four live tracks. Almost a year after its initial release So This Is Goodbye was re-released as a bonus edition including the original album, and remixes from the singles and the live tracks from the iTunes session. On 10 July 2007, Junior Boys second album was revealed as being on the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. ===2008–2011: Begone Dull Care and It's All True=== In April 2008 a single on the German Get Physical label was released titled \\"No Kinda Man\\", with mixes by Jona and Chloé. The original mix had just been featured on the same label's \\"Body Language Six\\" compilation released in March. Whilst the vinyl version was compiled by the band, the CD version was also mixed by the duo. In September 2008, Morgan Geist's new album \\"Double Night Time\\" was released with five songs featuring Jeremy Greenspan. On 16 January 2009, Junior Boys announced in an official press release that their third full-length album would be titled Begone Dull Care, and released on 24 March 2009 in Canada, 7 April in the United States and 11 May in Germany. The title and content of the new album was stated to be inspired by the Canadian animator Norman McLaren. A single from the album, \\"Hazel\\", was released on Domino Recording Company in April 2009. Junior Boys finally managed to tour Australia in September 2009 as part of the Parklife Festival. On 9 October 2010, via their Facebook page, they announced that their new album was nearly complete. On 11 March 2011, Junior Boys announced that their new album, It's All True, will be released on 13 June 2011.\\"New Junior Boys Album: It’s All True (+ MP3)\\", Obscure Sound, 11 March 2011. Luke Winkie at Paste Magazine reviewed It's All True and the album received a score of 7.7 out of ten from the magazine. \\"If Junior Boys’ fourth album It’s All True proves anything, it’s that the Ontarian, indie-electro originals will never be fully defrosted. Their stealthy, dampened beat-work has kept them remarkably suave in a subgenre that generally softens up to a dorkier demographic – and seven years since Last Exit the band is as frigidly unflappable as ever, progressing nicely through their expected idiosyncrasies, while continuing to sound effortlessly and solitarily cool.\\" They have been chosen by Caribou to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England. ===2012–present: Big Black Coat=== After the release of It's All True, the duo pursued solo and side projects, which included Jeremy Greenspan's working on music by Caribou and Jessy Lanza. In October 2015, the duo announced their fifth studio album and first release in five years, Big Black Coat. The album was released on the group's new label home, City Slang, in February 2016, and was preceded by two singles in late 2015: the title track, and \\"Over It\\". ==Promotions and media== In support of their 2006 album So This Is Goodbye, Junior Boys launched a fan-submitted video contest in conjunction with Domino Records and Imeem.com (now defunct). Participants were invited to use any song from So This Is Goodbye as the soundtrack for their original video creations. The winner is to receive a $1000 in cash and prizes. In October 2006 Junior Boys launched SoThisIsGoodbye.com (no longer held by Junior Boys), an interactive flash website based on the inspiration for the title. \\"It’s about dealing with the kind of goodbyes you say to things all the time that actually don’t tear you to pieces\\" explains Jeremy Greenspan of Junior Boys. Users were invited to post goodbye messages in the spirit of the title and to read those of others. In December 2006, Junior Boys produced a podcast with interview clips and tracks from So This Is Goodbye. The podcast was featured as part of the Dominocast series of podcasts. In August 2007 the track \\"In The Morning\\" from So This Is Goodbye was featured in Mack Dawg Productions \\"Picture This\\" for Finnish professional snowboarder Eero Ettala's video part. \\"In The Morning\\" was also used for the \\"Picture This\\" trailer. \\"So This Is Goodbye\\" was recently used in the HBO drama Looking in 2015 as part of Season 2, episode 4, end credit sequence. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Last Exit (2004, Domino) *So This Is Goodbye (2006, Domino) *Begone Dull Care (2009, Domino) *It's All True (2011, Domino) *Big Black Coat (2016, City Slang) ===Extended plays=== * The Dead Horse EP (2007, Domino) * Kiss Me All Night EP (2016, City Slang/Domino) ===Singles=== *\\"Birthday/Last Exit\\" (2003) *\\"High Come Down\\" (2004) *\\"In the Morning\\" (2006) *\\"No Kinda Man\\" (2008) *\\"Hazel\\" (2009) *\\"Bits & Pieces\\" (2010) *\\"Banana Ripple\\" (2011) *\\"Big Black Coat\\" (2015) ===Remixes=== *Yoko Ono – \\"Give Me Something\\" (2010) *Stars – \\"Sleep Tonight\\" - Do You Trust Your Friends?

It was the first election to the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Ulster Unionist Party members won a two-thirds majority of votes cast and more than three-quarters of the seats in the assembly. Sinn Féin in particular was shocked at the scale of the Unionist victory, having spent considerable resources on the campaign, and had expected to win between 1/3 and 1/2 of the seats. The election was conducted using the single transferable vote system. The election took place during the Irish War of Independence, on the same day as the election to the parliament of Southern Ireland. As the election in Southern Ireland was merely a formality, with all candidates being returned unopposed (and therefore guaranteeing Sinn Féin complete dominance), Sinn Féin was able to focus its resources entirely on the election in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin campaign focused on the issue of partition implemented by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, with Sinn Féin and the Nationalist party running on a combined anti- partition ticket. ==Sinn Féin campaign== Sinn Féin invested considerable resources in their campaign, placing advertisements in almost 50 northern newspapers making a range of arguments against partition. Sinn Féin also published its own newspaper, The Unionist, of which 50,000 copies were sent to prominent Protestants in East Ulster, particularly County Antrim. In particular, Sinn Féin claimed there was widespread ignorance over the situation in Ulster and warned against the economic dangers of partition, particularly in relation to threats of a renewed boycott against northern goods in a manner similar to the \\"Belfast Boycott\\". Sinn Féin also attempted to attract Ulster's rural and agricultural workers, arguing partition would put them at the mercy of eastern Ulster's urban elites. Despite the scale and organisation of the campaign, its arguments failed to resonate with voters, with the party's chief organiser Eamon Donnelly claiming on the day of the election that all Sinn Féin's efforts had achieved was assuring a high Unionist turnout. ==Results== { style=\\"width:50%; text-align:center;\\" + ↓ - style=\\"color:white;\\"  style=\\"background:; width:76.92%;\\"  40  style=\\"background:; width:11.54%;\\"  6  style=\\"background:; width:11.54%;\\"  6 -  UUP  Sinn Fein  Nationalist } } Total electorate: 582,464; turnout: 88.0% (512,842). ===Votes summary=== ===Seats summary=== ==See also== *1921 Irish elections *List of members of the 1st Parliament of Northern Ireland ==Footnotes== ==References== *Northern Ireland Parliamentary Election Results Category:1921 elections in the United Kingdom 1921 Category:1921 in Northern Ireland Category:May 1921 events General Category:1920s elections in Northern Ireland ","title":"1921 Northern Ireland general election"},{"id":"1424964","text":"Taubaté is a medium-sized city in the State of São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil. ==Location== Its strategic location between the two most important Brazilian cities (São Paulo away, and Rio de Janeiro away), connected to both by the Presidente Dutra Highway, between high, cold mountains and the Atlantic Ocean has helped the development of the city.

The municipality contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraiba do Sul river. ==History== Fielded hills surround the entirety of Taubate. Taubaté was part of the ancient Tupinamba Territory, along the Paraiba do Sul River. The Tupinamba Territory in the 16th century, stretched from the Juqueriquerê River on the shores of Caraguatatuba to the Cape of Saint Thomas (Cabo de São Tomé) in the State of Rio de Janeiro. The first village was created in 1640 being proclaimed as an autonomous locality on December 5, 1645, by a pioneer named Jacques Felix. It was the first location in the Vale do Paraiba region to obtain autonomy. The locality got its current city status in 1842. By that time, it was one of the most important coffee production centers in the country, hosting the Taubaté's Agreement in 1906. In 1908, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Taubaté. In 1900 was the largest city in the interior of São Paulo. The county name comes from the Guarani language and means village (taba) high (ybaté). In 1891, Taubaté was one of the first cities in Brazil to industrialize with the CTI (Companhia Taubaté Industrial), a Textile Industry. ==Weather== The climate is classified as a humid subtropical climate, under the Köppen climate classification with the average annual temperature around , with a maximum of and a minimum of , with average humidity of 60% and the annual rainfalls of , the extremes temperatures recorded on the city are and , there is also an unofficial record of . ==Demographics== Male: 120.288; Female: 123.819; Urban: 229.810; Rural: 14.297 (Source: Censo 2000 - IBGE) Panorama of Taubaté ==Education and literature== Inside a class room of the University of Taubate Taubate is home to a large Brazilian Army Aviation base. Taubaté is also a university city. The University of Taubaté, UNITAU, is a municipal institution of higher learning run by the state, but also by the private initiative. Brazil, like France, is a country where state-owned universities are free and rank as the best, but UNITAU isn't free. UNITAU attracts young people from all over the country who come to study in one of its many colleges, such as Medical School, Law, Dentistry, Engineering, Business Management, and also at the Department of Architecture where several alumni have excelled and won national prizes for their work, notable the Opera Prima Award. Monteiro Lobato, reputedly one of the most significant Portuguese-language writer of books for children, was born in Taubaté. His books have been translated into many other languages, especially Sítio do Picapau Amarelo, the first and one of the largest tomes in the series of twelve. The unique way in which the narrative unfolds, gripping as they are for the many generations of children - and adults - who have read them, evolves in a style which can be likened to the sort of magic realism that permeates later styles of Latin American literature, and is set in rural São Paulo State where legends and myths naturally abound as the Portuguese colonial culture is fertilised by the fusion of amerindian and African cultures. The scene of his books is a fictional small farm - the Sítio do Picapau Amarelo ( loosely translated as the Yellow Woodpecker Estate) owned by the central character to all of M L's books, one Dona Benta, a cultivated widow living alone in the farmlet with her black female servant Nastácia. Dona Benta's grandchildren spend their summer holidays with her and most stories revolve around that scenario, which incidentally was inspired in M L's own property. José Bento de Monteiro Lobato was the grandnephew of the Viscount of Tremembé, a historical figure who lived in the region of Taubaté during the second half of the 19th century, in the days when Brazil, a constitutional monarchy independent from Portugal, was an expanding economy largely dependent on its coffee plantations. Unsurprisingly, in 06/01/10 Taubaté was granted, by the Chamber of Deputies, the title of National Capital of Children's literature.http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/EDUCACAO-E- CULTURA/148516-CAMARA-APROVA-TAUBATE-COMO-CAPITAL-NACIONAL-DA-LITERATURA- INFANTIL.html Another very important man in Taubatean and Brazilian history was Amacio Mazzaropi who was one of the pioneers in the movie industry, creating many classics that show a rural Brazil in the first half of the 20th century. Mazzaropi embodies what might be described as a rural Brazilian stereotype, the Jeca – a dude – whose emotions and sentiments are universal but which nevertheless reflect his immediate environment and culture. Mazzaropi the actor and film maker was himself epitomic of another influence in that part of the country: the son of Italian immigrants who falls in love with his new homeland, although, it must be said, none of his roles reflects this, since what Amacio endeavoured to portray at all times was the somewhat raw, idillyc and also very dainty environment of the coffee growing regions of his birthplace and their pretty cities in the lush tropical landscape. ==Sports== Esporte Clube Taubaté is a football club based in the city. The main competition played by the club is the Campeonato Paulista Série A2, the second level of the São Paulo state professional football championship.

O'Connor both agreed that the Irish Party should not fight Sinn Féin for seats for the Southern parliament as things stood.Catholic Belfast and Nationalist Ireland in the Era of Joe Devlin, 1871-1934 p.226 Former Irish Parliamentary Party MP Stephen Gwynn, now a member of the Irish Dominion League, advocated putting up League candidates against Sinn Féin. In early March he met with southern Unionists Viscount Midleton and Lord Oranmore, requesting them to pool their resources to contest the election and contest the election on a platform opposing the IRA's violence, under Midleton's leadership. Midleton declined the invitation, just as he had declined a previous request for his Unionist Anti-Partition League to join the Dominion League.Stephen Gwynn and the failure of constitutional nationalism in Ireland, pp. 741–742 A single Unionist candidate had been selected to contest the constituency of Donegal: Major Robert L Moore, who had contested East Donegal in 1918.The Evening Leader, Corning, NY, 22 April 1921, P2 Moore however later withdrew his candidacy just before the election.The Sunday Oregonian.

The college serves approximately 8,000 students in credit-based courses and 3,000 students in noncredit courses. RCTC offers 130 degree programs, with more than 300 online classes and 70 technical programs. Numerous other degree options are made available through the Minnesota Transfer Curriculum (MnTC). The campus is the oldest Community College in Minnesota, established in 1915 by Charles Horace Mayo. It offers ten varsity sports including football, women's volleyball, men's and women's basketball, women's softball, wrestling, men's and women's golf, baseball, and women's soccer. Rochester Community and Technical College is also a Post Secondary Institution. This means that high school juniors and seniors can take courses at RCTC if they meet eligibility requirements. Admissions requirements include things such as a specific grade- point-average. Many students choose to participate in the Post Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO) because the credit hours taken at the college are counted at the high school as well. If the student continues his or her education beyond high school graduation, the credits may transfer to another a university as college credit. PSEO is common among public school students, private school students, and homeschool students in the Rochester area.http://www.rctc.edu/pseo/ *Winona State University-Rochester Center, (WSU-RC) is part of Winona State University.

There are still plans by the Swiss Air Force and in the Swiss parliament to operate eighteen F-5E and four F-5F until 2018. This would also include the continued operation of the Patrouille Suisse flying the F-5E until 2018.

Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as \\"the master of us all\\" by Christian Dior. His bubble skirts and odd, feminine, yet \\"modernistic\\" silhouettes became the trademarks of the house. Balenciaga closed in 1972 and was reopened under new ownership in 1986. The brand is now owned by the French multinational holding company Kering. ==History== Cristóbal Balenciaga, founder of the house in 1917 Balenciaga dresses on display in Florence, Italy Cristóbal Balenciaga opened his first boutique in San Sebastián, Spain, in 1917, and expanded to include branches in Madrid and Barcelona. The Spanish royal family and the aristocracy wore his designs, but when the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his stores, Balenciaga moved to Paris. Balenciaga opened his Paris couture house on Avenue George V in August 1937, and his first fashion show featured designs heavily influenced by the Spanish Renaissance. Balenciaga's success in Paris was nearly immediate. In the period of two years, the French press lauded him as a revolutionary, and his designs were highly sought-after. Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, was an early champion of his designs. Customers risked their safety to travel to Europe during World War II to see Balenciaga's clothing. During this period, he was noted for his \\"square coat,\\" with sleeves cut in a single piece with the yoke, and for his designs with black (or black and brown) lace over bright pink fabric. However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. His lines became more linear and sleek, diverging from the hourglass shape popularized by Christian Dior's \\"New Look\\". The fluidity of his silhouettes enabled him to manipulate the relationship between his clothing and women's bodies. In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1958. Other contributions in the postwar era included the spherical balloon jacket (1953), the high-waisted baby doll dress (1957), the cocoon coat (1957), the balloon skirt (1957), and the sack dress (1957). In 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos. His manipulation of the waist, in particular, contributed to \\"what is considered to be his most important contribution to the world of fashion: a new silhouette for women.\\" In the 1960s, Balenciaga was an innovator in his use of fabrics: he tended toward heavy fabrics, intricate embroidery, and bold materials. His trademarks included \\"collars that stood away from the collarbone to give a swanlike appearance\\" and shortened \\"bracelet\\" sleeves. His often spare, sculptural creations--including funnel-shape gowns of stiff duchess satin worn to acclaim by clients such as Pauline de Rothschild, Bunny Mellon, Marella Agnelli, Hope Portocarrero, Gloria Guinness, and Mona von Bismarck--were considered masterworks of haute couture in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1960, he designed the wedding dress for Queen Fabiola of Belgium made of ivory duchess satin trimmed with white mink at the collar and the hips. Jackie Kennedy famously upset John F. Kennedy for buying Balenciaga's expensive creations while he was President because he feared that the American public might think the purchases too lavish. Her haute couture bills were eventually discreetly paid by her father- in-law, Joseph Kennedy. === Protégés === Several designers who worked for Balenciaga would go on to open their own successful couture houses, notably Oscar de la Renta (1949), Andre Courreges (1950), Emanuel Ungaro (1958), but his most famous and noted protégé was Hubert de Givenchy, who was the lone designer to side with Balenciaga against the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture Parisienne and also the press over the scheduling of his shows. ===Battle against the press=== In 1957, Balenciaga famously decided to show his collection to the fashion press the day before the clothing retail delivery date, not the standard four weeks before the retail delivery date the fashion industry followed at the time. By keeping the press unaware of the design of his garments until the day before they were shipped to stores, he hoped to curtail ongoing piracy and copying of his designs. The press resisted, finding it nearly impossible to get his work into their print deadlines, but Balenciaga and protégé Givenchy stood firm, seriously impacting their coverage and press of the era. His supporters would argue that rival Christian Dior would gain acclaim from copying Balenciaga's silhouettes and cuts, claiming them as his own original work; because Balenciaga was not interested in press coverage, the media, and consumers never knew. In 1967, both designers reversed their decision and joined the traditional schedule. ===Battle against the Chambre=== Balenciaga defiantly resisted the rules, guidelines, and bourgeoisie status of the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture parisienne, and, thus, was never a member. Although he is spoken of with immense reverence, technically, Balenciaga couture was never haute couture. Cristóbal Balenciaga closed his fashion house in 1968 and died in 1972. The house lay dormant until 1986. ==Balenciaga today== Balenciaga exhibit, Fine Arts Museum (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao), Bilbao, Spain In 1986, Jacques Bogart S.A. acquired the rights to Balenciaga, and opened a new ready-to-wear line, \\"Le Dix\\". The first collection was designed by Michel Goma in October 1987, who remained at the house for the next five years to mixed reviews. He was replaced in 1992 with Dutch designer Josephus Thimister who began the restoration of Balenciaga to high-fashion status. During Thimister's term, Nicolas Ghesquière would join as a license designer, and eventually was promoted to head designer in 1997. In 1992, House of Balenciaga designed the French team's clothes for the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona. Balenciaga is now owned by Kering, formerly known as PPR, and its womenswear and menswear was headed by Nicolas Ghesquière. Ghesquière, like Balenciaga, is a self- taught designer, and apprenticed to Jean-Paul Gaultier and Agnes B. The fresh interpretation of Balenciaga classics, such as the semifitted jacket and the sack dress, caught the attention of the media as well as such celebrities as Madonna and Sinéad O'Connor. In 2002, Balenciaga's star, Nicolas Ghesquiere, imitated the work of Kaisik Wong, a designer from San Francisco. Ghesquiere created a patchwork vest in his spring collection that resembled one that Wong designed in 1973. Ghesquiere admitted in an interview in Paris that he had copied the garment. There was some conflict within the House of Balenciaga on Ghesquiere's designs, with the Gucci group saying that if Balenciaga didn't make any money in 2007 they would replace him. Ghesquière's F/W 2005 line showed that the house was not only making money, but also attracted a number of celebrity customers including editor-in-chief at Vogue, Anna Wintour. The House of Balenciaga designed the dresses worn by Jennifer Connelly and Nicole Kidman to the 2006 Academy Awards, as well as the wedding gown Kidman wore when she married Keith Urban. Kylie Minogue also wore a Balenciaga dress for her \\"Slow\\" and \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" music videos and for her concert tour. Today, the brand is best known for its line of motorcycle-inspired handbags, especially the \\"Lariat\\". Balenciaga has eight exclusive boutiques in the United States. One Balenciaga store is located on 22nd St in New York City, New York. A second store is located in Los Angeles, California, on Melrose Avenue. Recently, a third store opened at the South Coast Plaza, in Costa Mesa, California. This store is and includes coffin-like inset displays. The New York and Los Angeles boutiques carry both men's and women's ready-to-wear, while the South Coast Plaza boutique carries only women's clothing. A fourth, located in Las Vegas inside Caesars Palace, carries only accessories. An additional location on the Las Vegas Strip, in Crystals at CityCenter, sells accessories as well as women's ready-to-wear. The boutique at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, offers men's and women's ready-to-wear and accessories. There is a store at the Bal Harbour shops in Bal Harbour, Florida. An eighth store is opening spring 2014 in Dallas, [Texa, at the Highland Park Village to become the first boutique in Texas. The Highland Park Village boutique is opening next to Christian Dior and will carry men's and women's ready to wear and accessories. All of the boutiques employ spirited architecture, with white paneling, marble, and glass work as well as black leather seats and light green, black and navy carpets or white tiles, emphasizing the brand's lean toward avant-garde and the drama of fashion. Balenciaga's Fall/Winter 2007 show impressed Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Amy Astley so much that an entire spread in the magazine, titled \\"Global Studies\\" and shot in Beijing, was influenced by it. The line included skinny jodhpurs, tight, fitted blazers, beaded embellished scarves, and other multicultural mixes. Balenciaga is known for creating avant-garde structural pieces, straddling the edge of fashion and forecasting the future of women's ready-to-wear fashion. Vintage Balenciaga garments are popular among fashion editors, Hollywood stars, and models, and have been seen on Sienna Miller, Lara Bingle, Raquel Zimmerman, Caroline Trentini, Emmanuelle Alt, Tatiana Sorokko, Hilary Rhoda, Jennifer Garner, and Stephanie Seymour, among others. Balenciaga is also frequently worn by actress Chloë Sevigny, who is also a muse of Nicolas Ghesquiere. In March 2011 at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum, Balenciaga celebrated the opening of Balenciaga and Spain, a 120-piece fashion retrospective of Cristóbal Balenciaga's career. The exhibition included many designs from the museum's encyclopedic costume collection. \\"You can't even measure it,\\" said Rodarte designer Laura Mulleavy of Cristóbal Balenciaga's influence. The $2,500-a-ticket fund-raiser for the museum drew 350 guests, including Denise Hale, Marissa Mayer, Vanessa Getty, Victoria Traina, Vanessa Traina, Jamie Tisch, Gwyneth Paltrow, Orlando Bloom, Balthazar Getty, Maggie Rizer, Connie Nielsen, Maria Bello, and Mia Wasikowska. In November 2012, Balenciaga announced that it was parting with creative director Nicolas Ghesquière, ending his 15-year tenure. The brand announced Alexander Wang its new creative director. Wang presented his first collection for the label on 28 February 2013 at Paris Fashion Week. In 2014, the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris set a trial date for the lawsuit between Balenciaga vs. Ghesquière. Kering- owned Balenciaga claimed that Ghesquière's comments in the magazine System had hurt the company's image. The highly publicized suit was mediated out of court. In July 2015, Balenciaga announced it was parting with creative director Alexander Wang after three years. The Spring/Summer 2016 show was his last, featuring white lounge wear made from soft, natural fabrics. In early- October 2015, the brand announced Demna Gvasalia as its new creative director. ==Creative directors== * Cristóbal Balenciaga – 1919 to 1968 * Michel Goma – 1987 to 1992 * Josephus Thimister – 1992 to 1997 * Nicolas Ghesquière – 1997 to 2012 * Alexander Wang – 2013(fall) to 2015 * Demna Gvasalia – 2015 to present ==In popular culture== On January 29, 2014, the character Myrtle Snow cries \\"Balenciaga!\\" as her dying words on the season finale of FX television show American Horror Story: Coven.

The Chinese customer, who is an elderly lady, protested to the group of queue-jumping customers, who responded by allegedly shoving the Chinese customer. A viral video of the incident quickly swept through Chinese social media website Weibo, which enraged Chinese customers, and are calling for a boycott of the fashion house. On April 27, 2018, two days after the incident, the House of Balenciaga issued a public notice and apology concerning the April 25, 2018, incident. The fashion house apparently suspended the management staff present during the incident and is working closely with Printemps store management to investigate the matter. The hashtag #Boycott BalenciagaDiscriminatesChinese have been viewed 23 million times on Weibo as of Friday, April 27, 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Paris Fashion Show 2007: Balenciaga Catwalk * The Cristobal Balenciaga Museum in Getaria, Spain * Professor Aiko Beall of Otis College of Art and Design on Balenciaga * Category:1919 establishments in France Category:Clothing companies of France Category:Shoe companies of France Category:Clothing companies established in 1919 Category:Companies based in Paris Category:Design companies established in 1919 Category:Fashion accessory brands Category:French brands Category:French companies established in 1919 Category:Gucci brands Category:High fashion brands es:Cristóbal Balenciaga ","title":"Balenciaga"},{"id":"1425029","text":"The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was created by the Treaty of Lagos on May 28, 1975, in Lagos, Lagos State, Nigeria.

Hershey is known for his 1932 Peerless V-16 prototype, 1949 Cadillac tailfins, and the 1955 Ford Thunderbird. ==Early life and education== Hershey was born in Michigan, and raised in Beverly Hills and La Puente, California. He attended Occidental College where he majored in forestry. ==Career== Hershey began his career at Murphy Coach Works of Pasadena, California under the guidance of Frank Spring. While at Murphy, he was assigned the task of designing the 1932 Peerless X-D V-16 prototype. From Murphy, Hershey went to work for GM where he focused on the 1933 Pontiac. In designing the 1935 Pontiac, he introduced the silver streak design theme that the make would continue until 1956. He also was assigned to GM's Opel design offices in Germany in 1936, and GM's Holden make in Australia. Hershey served in the Navy during World War II. After leaving GM, Hershey set up his own design firm. Harley Earl attempted to lure him back to GM; he chose not to return only to learn years later that had he returned he would have been Earl's first choice to replace him as GM's Vice President of Design. After several years with Packard, he went to Ford where he designed the 1953-1957 full sized Fords. According to an interview given by Hershey to James W. Howell in 1995, George Walker had been hired as the public face of Ford design. Hershey designed the landmark Ford Thunderbird, and admitted so in a 1954 interview, which created friction between Walker and Hershey.Independent research by James W. Howell (Collectible Automobile, December, 1995, p. 72) verifies Hershey's claim based on original drawings, notes and first person accounts. After leaving Ford, Hershey also worked for Kaiser Aluminum and Rite Autotronics, heading design effort in both companies. ==Personal life== Hershey was married and the father of two children.

It was one of only six professional helicopter teams in the world, along with: Royal Navy Black Cats; Sarang of the Indian Air Force; Scorpion aerobatic team of the Polish Air Force; Rotores de Portugal and the Patrulla Aspa of the Spanish Air Force. They were formed in the spring of 1968 by instructors at the British Army Air Corps. They were established the following years with five helicopters. In 2001, the team included the first British female military display pilot. In 2010 it was disbanded due to an ageing Lynx fleet and financial cutbacks. ==History== The Blue Eagles were formed in the spring of 1968 by instructors at the British Army Air Corps centred at Middle Wallop who practised in their spare time. One year later the team was permanently established with five Bell-47G3B1 Sioux helicopters. Despite no official formation flying training from the army, the team achieved growing success and by 1974 they were including venues as far apart as the Channel Islands, Scotland and Germany. Nonetheless, the Army could not afford to maintain the Blue Eagles on a full-time basis and the team disbanded. Enthusiastic pilots at Middle Wallop were left to continue the team on their own time, and they kept the team and expertise alive. The team performed under a variety of names including the Eagles, Army Eagles, and Sparrow-hawks. The team in 1975 In 1982 the team briefly officially reformed as the Silver Eagles for the Army Air Corps' 25th anniversary. During this time the team flew the Bell/Agusta, the Aérospatiale Gazelle, the Westland Lynx, and the Westland Scout helicopters and occasionally even incorporated fixed-wing aircraft into their displays. 1992 saw the Eagles equipped with four Lynx helicopters which amazed crowds with their unprecedented versatility and power. However the Army needed Lynx helicopters elsewhere and could not justify the expensive flying time for an unofficial team. Thus the team adopted a configuration of four Gazelles and one Lynx in 1993. The team experienced a strong resurgence and won the prestigious Wilkinson Sword at the Royal International Air Tattoo. Following this success the team was allowed to return to the Blue Eagles moniker in 1994, though the team was still composed entirely of volunteers. The Team Lynx, XZ647, showing the Blue Eagles logo on the nose. In 2001, the team included the very first British female military display pilot, Sgt Julie Wiles. The team continued to fly out of Middle Wallop and its repertoire included formation flying, loops, rolls, breaks, and many other standard aerobatic stunts until the team was disbanded in 2010, due to financial considerations and an ageing Lynx fleet. It was succeeded in its role by the Solo Apache Display team. ==See also== *Red Arrows, the world-famous Royal Air Force fixed wing (plane) display team. *Silver Eagles, the United States Army helicopter display team from 1972-1976. *Black Cats, Royal Navy helicopter display team. *Sarang, Indian Air Force helicopter display team *Rotores de Portugal, Portuguese Air Force helicopter display team == References == ==External links== * Blue Eagles official site * Additional info Category:Army Air Corps (United Kingdom) Category:British aerobatic teams Category:1968 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in Hampshire Category:Test Valley Category:Military units and formations established in 1968 ","title":"Blue Eagles"},{"id":"1425053","text":"was a Japanese poet and songwriter. She was born in Senzaki-mura, now part of Nagato, Yamaguchi prefecture. Senzaki was a fishing village, relying particularly on catches of Japanese sardine. Scenes of fishing and the sea often make appearances in her poems. Kaneko has been compared to Christina Rossetti. Her poems have been translated into eleven languages.Gross, Annise (2016). \\"Chin Music Press Translates Japanese Children's Poet for US Market,\\", Publishers Weekly ==Biography== Misuzu Kaneko's career as a writer of poetry for children began in earnest at the age of twenty, shortly after she became the manager and sole employee of a small bookstore in Shimonoseki, a town at the southern tip of Honshu. Kaneko was raised singlehandedly by her mother after her father died when she was three. Kaneko's mother ran a bookstore and felt strongly about reading and education. While most Japanese girls of that time period were only educated up to sixth grade, Kaneko continued her schooling until the age of seventeen. She was described by others as gentle, cheerful, and an excellent student as well as a voracious reader with strong curiosity about nature. At the bookstore Kaneko discovered a clutch of magazines which were riding the crest of a boom in children's literature and which solicited stories and verse from their readers. Kaneko sent in a number of poems, five of which, among them \\"The Fishes\\", were accepted for publication in the September 1923 issue of four of these magazines.Ito, Sally (2016). \\"Forgotten Woman: the Life of Misuzu Kaneko,\\", Electric Literature Soon, her poems began appearing in magazines all over the country and she became a literary celebrity. Over the next five years she published fifty-one more verses. Kaneko's private life was not as fortunate, however. Her husband, a clerk in her family bookstore, was unfaithful and contracted a venereal disease, which he passed on to her, and which caused her lifelong physical pain. He also forced her to stop writing. She finally divorced him but also lost custody of her daughter to her husband. Japanese law at the time automatically granted the father indisputable custody to the child. Kaneko sank into further despair. Kaneko committed suicide in 1930, shortly before her 27th birthday. After bathing her daughter and sharing a sakuramochi, Kaneko wrote a letter to her husband asking that he let her mother raise the girl, and took her own life. Her daughter was ultimately raised by the grandmother. ==Rediscovery of Kaneko's poems== Although she received praise for her published poems during her life, Kaneko's work descended into obscurity during the years of World War II In 1966 a 19-year-old Japanese aspiring poet named Setsuo Yazaki discovered her poem \\"Big Catch\\" in an obscure book. Eager to know more about the author, he spent sixteen years trying to track her down. In 1982 he was able to get in touch with Kaneko’s 77-year-old younger brother, who still had the diaries in which she wrote her poems. The entire collection has since been published by JULA Publishing Bureau in a six-volume anthology, and in 2016, an English-language edition of her poetry Are You an Echo? The Lost Poetry of Misuzu Kaneko was released by the independent book publisher Chin Music Press. It received an Honorable Mention in the Freeman Awards 2016. ==\\"Are You an Echo?\\" and the 2011 tsunami== After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, television stations played Kaneko's poem “Are You an Echo?” as a public service announcement in order to encourage volunteers. == See also == * List of Japanese writers: K == References== == External links== * UNESCO portal * info about Misuzu Kaneko at the Misuzu Kaneko Museum * Chin Music Press: Misuzu Kaneko * Brain Pickings *\\"Forgotten Woman: the Life of Misuzu Kaneko\\" Category:1903 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Japanese women poets Category:Musicians from Yamaguchi Prefecture Category:Poets who committed suicide Category:Suicides in Japan Category:20th-century Japanese poets Category:20th-century Japanese women writers ","title":"Misuzu Kaneko"},{"id":"1425060","text":"Asian Highway 7 (AH7) is a route in the Asian Highway Network.

The BA degree and BSc Economics with specialisation in various components like Geography, Economics and Law, attracted many British and foreign students, and also lecturers from various London University Colleges. There was also a School of Liberal Arts which offered secretarial and undergraduate language course in French, Spanish, German and Russian and included a semester at L'ecole d'interpretes, University of Geneva. It was considered revolutionary at the time (mid-sixties) The two-year Groundcourse was held in the annex to the Art School. The \\"Groundcourse\\" was a radical and influential experiment in art education, led by Roy Ascott with a team of artists including R B Kitaj and Anthony Benjamin. For a few years in the 1970s, the college had a separate campus at Woodlands Avenue, Acton, where the Schools of Librarianship and Management were based. ==Notable alumni== ===Artists=== * Vic Duppa-Whyte – Paper engineer, pop-up books creator * Michael English – English psychedelic artist-musician with Hapshash and the Coloured Coat * Gideon Gechtman – Israeli artist and sculptor * Alan Lee – English illustrator (won an Oscar for his work on the Lord of the Rings movie) * Arthur Ted Powell – advertising art director and artist * Barbara Tate – artist and author * Stephen Willats - artist * Fiona Adams - Photographer.

The report deals with the mediation efforts between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, the two UN supervised truces in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, June 11 - July 9, 1948 and July 18 to the time the report was written and with the refugee situation. Bernadotte was an ardent supporter of the Arab refugees right to return -- in the report he strongly urged the provisional Israeli government to let them return to their homes: :It would be an offence against the principles of elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the right to return to their homes while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine, and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.

In high school, he was co-captain of the basketball team and co-captain and number one player on the golf team. He was a member of Bamm Hollow Country Club. Nantz then went to the University of Houston in Texas, where he majored in broadcasting and played on the Houston Cougars men's golf team, rooming with future professional golfers Fred Couples and Blaine McCallister. It was during this time that Nantz got his first experience in sports broadcasting with the CBS Radio Network, transmitting taped interviews to Win Elliot for the latter's Sports Central USA weekend reports.Sandomir, Richard. \\"Win Elliot, Who Broadcast Sports With Flair, Dies at 83\\", The New York Times, September 20, 1998. ====Before CBS Sports==== Nantz started as an anchor and sportscaster for KHOU Houston in the early 80s and then became a weekend sports anchor on KSL-TV in Salt Lake City (1982-1985) where he called BYU football games and Utah Jazz games along with Hot Rod Hundley. ===At CBS Sports=== Nantz joined CBS Sports in 1985, initially working as a studio host for the network's college football and basketball coverage, and as an on- course reporter for PGA Tour golf, as well as calling NFL games on Westwood One (from 1988 to 1990, when he was moved to television, Nantz called Sunday Night Football games for what was then called CBS Radio Sports). Nantz has anchored CBS' coverage of the Masters Tournament since 1989. He teamed with Billy Packer to call the NCAA Final Four men's basketball finals from 1991 until 2008. From 2008 to 2013, Clark Kellogg had been his analyst. From 2010 to 2013, Nantz and Kellogg were joined during the Final Four by Steve Kerr of Turner Sports. From 2013 to 2014, Greg Anthony partnered with Nantz. Following Anthony's suspension, Bill Raftery and Grant Hill were selected to replace him and are Nantz's new partners Fine, Marshall, \\"The Voice of Sports\\", Cigar Aficionado, June 2011, pp. 62–76. ====The NFL on CBS==== After hosting CBS's pre-game program The NFL Today from 1998 to 2003, he became The NFL on CBS top play-by-play announcer in 2004. That move sent Greg Gumbel to the studio, and Nantz to the stadium booth with Phil Simms. In 1991 & 1992, Nantz, like Tim Brant, was paired with analyst Hank Stram on NFL broadcasts. In 1993, he had previously filled-in for his predecessor, Greg Gumbel as NFL Today host while Gumbel was away covering the American League Championship Series for CBS. Verne Lundquist and Dan Fouts were the #2 team for much of the 1993 season. However, Nantz and Randy Cross would call the second round playoff game for CBS (Dallas vs. Green Bay) not called by Pat Summerall and John Madden. Meanwhile, Tim Ryan and Matt Millen were the #3 team for much of the 1993 season. On February 4, 2007, Nantz called the play-by-play of Super Bowl XLI. He joins Curt Gowdy, Kevin Harlan, and Dick Enberg as the only play-by-play announcers to ever call both a Super Bowl and an NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game. (Greg Gumbel called CBS's previous Super Bowls, Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XXXVIII.) Nantz is also one of two men to host a Super Bowl, announce an NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game, and host coverage of The Masters from Butler Cabin with Brent Musburger being the other. Musburger also accomplished all three feats with CBS. During Super Bowl XLVII, Joe Flacco unknowingly hit Nantz with the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the presentation, but Nantz simply brushed it off. In 2014, Nantz and broadcast partner Phil Simms called Thursday Night Football games in a deal with CBS and the NFL Network. Tracy Wolfson was the sideline reporter for the Thursday games along with the Sunday games on CBS. In 2017, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo replaced Phil Simms as Nantz's color commentator for CBS' NFL telecasts.https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tony-romo-officially- joins-cbs-sports-as-lead-nfl-game-analyst-after-retiring/ ===Media appearances=== Nantz has appeared on episodes of The Price Is Right to present a Showcase prize that involves CBS Sports properties, one to attend the 2009 Final Four in Detroit and another in 2010 for Super Bowl XLIV (with Phil Simms), as part of changes to the long-time game show to use product placement models and CBS crossovers, including sports packages. Nantz appeared as himself in the 1996 film Tin Cup and has appeared in episodes of several television series including Arliss, Yes, Dear, Criminal Minds, and How I Met Your Mother (season 5, episode 14 + 15 and season 9, episode 24). He portrayed the announcer for the fictional baseball team in the short-lived series Clubhouse, and his voice can be heard in the 1998 film Scrapple. Since 2009, Nantz has guest commentated on the final round of The Open Championship for the BBC. Nantz teamed with Gary McCord to provide extensive commentary in the 1999 PC golf game Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge, and his commentary is featured in the Golden Tee Golf arcade game series. From 2012 until 2016 (when they were replaced with Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis), Nantz, along with Phil Simms, provided commentary for the Madden NFL series. In 2013, Nantz appeared in a Papa John's Pizza ad with Peyton Manning, quarterback of the Denver Broncos, and founder John Schnatter. In 2005, Nantz provided commentary on the games in short-lived British wrestling based-game show Celebrity Wrestling. ===Career timeline=== * 1985–1988; 1997: NCAA Football on CBS – studio host * 1986–present: PGA Tour on CBS (since 1994 as host) * 1986–1990: College Basketball on CBS – studio host * 1986–1989: NBA on CBS – play-by-play * 1987–1990: NFL on CBS Radio – play-by-play * 1987–1995: US Open (tennis) – play-by-play * 1989–present: The Masters host * 1989–1991; 1996–1997: NCAA Football on CBS – lead play-by-play * 1990–present: College Basketball on CBS/Turner – lead play-by-play * 1988–present: NFL on CBS – play-by-play (1993 as #2/2004–present as lead) * 1992 and 1994: Winter Olympics – weekend daytime co-host * 1994–1995; 2000–2001: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade host (under the title \\"The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS\\") * 1998–2003: The NFL Today host * 1998: Olympic Winter Games – primetime host * 2004–present: NFL on CBS – lead play-by-play * 2014–2017: Thursday Night Football – lead play-by-play ==Awards== Nantz won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality, Play- by-Play in both 2008 and 2009.

Nantz tells personal stories from football, basketball, and golf, and how he has met people along the way who remind him of the virtues his father instilled in him. The foreword to the book was written by one of his father figures, friend and frequent golf partner, former President George H.W. Bush. Nantz's father, Jim Nantz Jr., died in 2008 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease; he was treated at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. In January 2011, Jim Nantz and The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, launched the Nantz National Alzheimer Center. The mission of the Center is to improve care and treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research and the investigation of its causes, including the role of concussions and other past neurological trauma. Nantz was married to Ann-Lorraine \\"Lorrie\\" Carlsen Nantz for 26 years before divorcing in 2009. The couple lived in Westport, Connecticut, and had one child, daughter Caroline.Connecticut Post, CBS sportscaster, wife testify in Bridgeport In November 2009, Jim Nantz was ordered to pay his ex-wife $916,000 a year in child support and alimony. Nantz acknowledged dating a 29-year-old woman before the divorce was final, although the judge concluded the marriage deteriorated years earlier and \\"this remote event in no way contributed to the breakdown of the marriage.\\" Nantz was said to earn $7 million in 2009.

They have been shown to be as effective as the combined oral contraceptive pill with perfect use, and the patch may be more effective in typical use.Contraceptive Technology, Chapter 12, Contraceptive Patch and Vaginal Contraceptive Ring, by Kavita Nanda, page 272 Xulane and Twirla are approved for use in the United States. Evra is approved for use in Canada and marketed by Janssen Inc.; and it is approved for use in the United Kingdom and in Europe and marketed by Janssen-Cilag. The patches are packaged in boxes of three and are only available by prescription. == Medical uses == Because the patch works similar to that of birth control pills, many of the benefits are the same. For example, the patch may make a woman's period lighter and more regular. It may also help to clear acne, decrease cramps, and reduce PMS symptoms. Additionally, the patch is associated with an increased protection against iron deficiency anemia, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometrial and ovarian cancer. The patch is a simple and convenient form of birth control that requires weekly attention. When a woman stops using the patch, her ability to become pregnant returns quickly.Planned Parenthood (2011). \\"Birth Control Patch (Ortho Evra).\\" Retrieved from http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control- patch-ortho-evra-4240.htm, on February 3, 2011. ==Side effects== In three large clinical trials involving a total of 3,330 women using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch for up to one year, 12% of users discontinued the patch because of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events leading to patch discontinuation were: nausea and/or vomiting (2.4%), application site reaction (1.9%), breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (1.9%), headache (1.1%), and emotional lability (1.0%). The most frequent adverse events reported while using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch were: breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (22%), headache (21%), application site reaction (17%), nausea (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), menstrual cramps (10%), and abdominal pain (9%). Breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting while using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch was reported by: 18% in cycle 1, 12% in cycle 3, 8% in cycle 6 and cycle 13. Breakthrough bleeding (requiring more than one pad or tampon per day) was reported by: 4% in cycle 1, 3% in cycle 3 and cycle 6, and 1% in cycle 13. Overall, side effects that tend to go away after two or three months include bleeding between periods, breast tenderness, and nausea and vomiting. Symptoms that may last longer include skin irritation around the area where the patch is placed and a change in the woman's sexual desires. Additional side effect information is provided in the Ortho Evra label information and the Evra Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and PIL. ===Interactions and contraindications=== Contraceptive effectiveness of the patch or any other hormonal contraceptive may be reduced significantly if administered alongside various antibiotics, antifungals, anticonvulsants, or other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. However, despite the interactions with many other antibiotics, a clinical pharmacokinetic drug interaction study showed that oral administration of tetracycline HCl 500 mg for three days prior to and seven days during use of Ortho Evra \\"did not reduce effectiveness of Ortho Evra.\\" This is a significant factor in the common decision to administer tetracycline-derived antibiotics following an abortion (preventatively to fight potential infection) when synthetic hormone contraceptives are to be used afterwards. Drugs containing St. John's Wort are also known to affect the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. It has also been found that the patch is less effective in women who weigh more than 198 pounds (90 kg). The contraceptive patch and other combination hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in women older than 35 years who smoke cigarettes. The contraceptive patch is contraindicated for use in women with a BMI ≥ 30kg/m2. ===Thromboembolism=== All combined hormonal birth control products have a very small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A recent study found that users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non- fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35 µg of estrogen.Medpage Today. Evidence on Ortho Evra Patch Thrombosis Risk Is Contradictory . Published February 17, 2006. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35 µg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping. In studies with oral contraceptives, the risk for cardiovascular disease (such as thromboembolism) is significantly increased in women over the age of 35 years who also smoke tobacco. Hence, Ortho-Evra's package insert states: \\"Women who use hormonal contraceptives, including Ortho Evra, should be strongly advised not to smoke.\\" According to the manufacturer, the patches introduce a 60% higher level of estrogen into the bloodstream as compared to oral contraceptives; however, the clinical significance of this difference is unknown. On November 10, 2005 Ortho McNeil, in conjunction with the FDA, revised the label for Ortho Evra, including a new bolded warning about higher exposure to estrogen for women using the weekly patch compared to taking a daily birth control pill containing 35 µg of estrogen, noting that higher levels of estrogen may put some women at increased risk for getting blood clots. The label was again revised in September 2006, and on January 18, 2008, the FDA again updated the label to reflect study results. \\"The FDA believes that Ortho Evra is a safe and effective method of contraception when used according to the labeling, which recommends that women with concerns or risk factors for serious blood clots talk with their health care provider about using Ortho Evra versus other contraceptive options.\\"FDA Approves Update to Label on Birth Control Patch. FDA. January 18, 2008 ==Method of use== A woman applies her first patch onto her upper outer arm, buttocks, abdomen or thigh on either the first day of her menstrual cycle (day 1) or on the first Sunday following that day, whichever she prefers. The day of application is known from that point as patch change day. Seven days later, when patch change day comes again, the woman removes the patch and applies another to one of the approved locations on the body. This process is repeated again on the next patch change day. On the following patch change day, the patch is removed and not replaced. The woman waits seven days without a patch in place, and on the next patch change day she applies a new patch. Extended use regimens, where patches are used for several weeks before a patch-free week, have been studied. The patch should be applied to skin that is clean, dry, and intact. This means, if skin is red, irritated, or cut, the patch should not be placed in that area. Additionally, avoid using lotions, powder, or makeup around the area where the patch is, or will be placed.Mayo Clinic (2010). \\"Ortho Evra (Contraceptive Patch).\\" Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ortho- evra/MY01006/DSECTION=what-you-can-expect, on February 3, 2011. ===Backup contraception=== :*If a woman chooses to begin with her patch change day as day one of her menstrual cycle, the patch is able to take effect in time to prevent ovulation (see Mechanism of Action below) and no form of backup contraception is needed at all. :**In the case that a woman wishes to begin using the contraceptive patch following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, patch application can be done immediately afterwards. This can be considered the same as a day one start above, and no backup contraception is required. :*If a woman chooses to begin with her patch change day as the first Sunday following day 1, it is necessary to use a backup form of contraception such as spermicidehttps://picaboo.biz/what-is-spermicide-and-what-effects- does-it-have-on-our-body/ Picaboo.biz or condoms for the first week of patch wear. :*If a woman is late placing her patch in the first week, or more than two days late placing the patch in the second and third weeks, she should apply the patch immediately, and then use a back up form of barrier protection for a week.Mayo Clinic. \\"Ortho Evra (Contraceptive Patch).\\" Retrieved from http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ortho-evra/MY01006/DSECTION=what-you-can- expect, on February 3, 2011 == Mechanism of action == Illustration depicting transdermal contraceptive patch. Like all combined hormonal contraceptives, Ortho Evra / Evra works primarily by preventing ovulation. A secondary mechanism of action is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation; however, no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use. The 20 cm2 Ortho Evra contraceptive patch contains 750 µg ethinylestradiol (an estrogen) and 6000 µg norelgestromin (a progestin). The 20 cm2 Evra contraceptive patch contains 600 µg ethinylestradiol and 6000 µg norelgestromin. The Ortho Evra contraceptive patch and the Evra contraceptive patch are both intended to gradually release into the systemic circulation approximately 20 µg/day of ethinylestradiol and 150 µg/day of norelgestromin. == Lawsuits == The patch has been associated with strokes and thrombosis and the mechanism for hormone absorption and dissipation from the body's tissues is different from \\"the pill.\\" Several lawsuits have been instigated over these issues. A lawsuit filed in Federal Court in New Jersey on September 2, 2005 by a Georgia woman who suffered a pulmonary embolism alleges the company promoted the patch despite knowledge of its health risks, for financial gain, while failing to warn of the risks of blood clots and other injuries. In November 2005, CBS News aired a story about documents that surfaced in a lawsuit involving a young mother who was paralyzed by a stroke and remained a total invalid, which showed the company had received nearly 500 reports of adverse events between April 2002 and December 2004. During the same time frame, only 61 adverse event reports were filed in connection with all type of birth- control pills.http://usa.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/31895 The parents of a 14-year-old girl from Wisconsin have filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson because they claim that she died from a blood clot that arose from her use of the patch.http://www.lacrossetribune.com/articles/2005/11/18/news/00lead.txt ==ReferencesFeminist Women's Health Center * Planned Parenthood: The Patch Category:Combined hormonal contraceptives Category:Transdermal patches Category:21st-century inventions ","title":"Contraceptive patch"},{"id":"1425130","text":"In chemistry the term stannate refers to compounds of tin (Sn).

When the entire cornea is replaced it is known as penetrating keratoplasty and when only part of the cornea is replaced it is known as lamellar keratoplasty. Keratoplasty simply means surgery to the cornea. The graft is taken from a recently dead individual with no known diseases or other factors that may affect the chance of survival of the donated tissue or the health of the recipient. The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil and anterior chamber. The surgical procedure is performed by ophthalmologists, physicians who specialize in eyes, and is often done on an outpatient basis. Donors can be of any age, as is shown in the case of Janis Babson, who donated her eyes at age 10. The corneal transplantation is performed when medicines, keratoconus conservative surgery and cross-linking cannot heal the cornea anymore. ==Medical uses== Indications include the following: *Optical: To improve visual acuity by replacing the opaque or distorted host tissue by clear healthy donor tissue. The most common indication in this category is pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, followed by keratoconus, corneal degeneration, keratoglobus and dystrophy, as well as scarring due to keratitis and trauma. *Tectonic/reconstructive: To preserve corneal anatomy and integrity in patients with stromal thinning and descemetoceles, or to reconstruct the anatomy of the eye, e.g. after corneal perforation. *Therapeutic: To remove inflamed corneal tissue unresponsive to treatment by antibiotics or anti- virals. *Cosmetic: To improve the appearance of patients with corneal scars that have given a whitish or opaque hue to the cornea. ==Risks== The risks are similar to other intraocular procedures, but additionally include graft rejection (lifelong), detachment or displacement of lamellar transplants and primary graft failure. Use of immunosupressants including cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and leflunomidprevent to prevent graft rejection is increasing but there is insufficient evidence to ascertain which immunosuppressant is better. In a Cochrane review which included low to moderate quality evidence, adverse effects were found to be common with systemic mycophenolate mofetil, but less common with topical treatments cyclosporine A and tacrolimus. There is also a risk of infection. Since the cornea has no blood vessels (it takes its nutrients from the aqueous humor) it heals much more slowly than a cut on the skin. While the wound is healing, it is possible that it might become infected by various microorganisms. This risk is minimized by antibiotic prophylaxis (using antibiotic eyedrops, even when no infection exists). There is a risk of cornea rejection, which occurs in about 10% of cases.Cornea transplant Risks - Tests and Procedures - Mayo Clinic Graft failure can occur at any time after the cornea has been transplanted, even years or decades later. The causes can vary, though it is usually due to new injury or illness. Treatment can be either medical or surgical, depending on the individual case. An early, technical cause of failure may be an excessively tight stitch cheesewiring through the sclera. ==Procedure== Cornea transplant one day after surgery. Cornea transplant after one year of healing, two stitches are visible On the day of the surgery, the patient arrives to either a hospital or an outpatient surgery center, where the procedure will be performed. The patient is given a brief physical examination by the surgical team and is taken to the operating room. In the operating room, the patient lies down on an operating table and is either given general anesthesia, or local anesthesia and a sedative. With anesthesia induced, the surgical team prepares the eye to be operated on and drapes the face around the eye. An eyelid speculum is placed to keep the lids open, and some lubrication is placed on the eye to prevent drying. In children, a metal ring is stitched to the sclera which will provide support of the sclera during the procedure. ===Pre-operative examination=== In most instances, the person will meet with their ophthalmologist for an examination in the weeks or months preceding the surgery. During the exam, the ophthalmologist will examine the eye and diagnose the condition. The doctor will then discuss the condition with the patient, including the different treatment options available. The doctor will also discuss the risks and benefits of the various options. If the patient elects to proceed with the surgery, the doctor will have the patient sign an informed consent form. The doctor might also perform a physical examination and order lab tests, such as blood work, X-rays, or an EKG. The surgery date and time will also be set, and the patient will be told where the surgery will take place. Within the United States, the supply of corneas is sufficient to meet the demand for surgery and research purposes. Therefore, unlike other tissues for transplantation, delays and shortages are not usually an issue. ===Penetrating keratoplasty=== Replacement of the entire cornea A trephine (a circular cutting device), which removes a circular disc of cornea, is used by the surgeon to cut the donor cornea. A second trephine is then used to remove a similar-sized portion of the patient's cornea. The donor tissue is then sewn in place with sutures. Antibiotic eyedrops are placed, the eye is patched, and the patient is taken to a recovery area while the effects of the anesthesia wear off. The patient typically goes home following this and sees the doctor the following day for the first postoperative appointment. ===Lamellar keratoplasty=== Lamellar keratoplasty encompasses several techniques which selectively replace diseased layers of the cornea while leaving healthy layers in place. The chief advantage is improved tectonic integrity of the eye. Disadvantages include the technically challenging nature of these procedures, which replace portions of a structure only 500 μm thick, and reduced optical performance of the donor/recipient interface compared to full-thickness keratoplasty. ====Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty==== In this procedure, the anterior layers of the central cornea are removed and replaced with donor tissue. Endothelial cells and the Descemets membrane are left in place. This technique is used in cases of anterior corneal opacifications, scars, and ectatic diseases such as keratoconus. ====Endothelial keratoplasty==== Endothelial keratoplasty replaces the patient's endothelium with a transplanted disc of posterior stroma/Descemets/endothelium (DSEK) or Descemets/endothelium (DMEK). This relatively new procedure has revolutionized treatment of disorders of the innermost layer of the cornea (endothelium). Unlike a full-thickness corneal transplant, the surgery can be performed with one or no sutures. Patients may recover functional vision in days to weeks, as opposed to up to a year with full thickness transplants. However, an Australian study has shown that despite its benefits, the loss of endothelial cells that maintain transparency is much higher in DSEK compared to a full-thickness corneal transplant. The reason may be greater tissue manipulation during surgery, the study concluded. During surgery the patient's corneal endothelium is removed and replaced with donor tissue. With DSEK, the donor includes a thin layer of stroma, as well as endothelium, and is commonly 100–150 μm thick. With DMEK, only the endothelium is transplanted. In the immediate postoperative period the donor tissue is held in position with an air bubble placed inside the eye (the anterior chamber). The tissue self-adheres in a short period and the air is adsorbed into the surrounding tissues. Complications include displacement of the donor tissue requiring repositioning (\\"refloating\\"). This is more common with DMEK than DSEK. Folds in the donor tissue may reduce the quality of vision, requiring repair. Rejection of the donor tissue may require repeating the procedure. Gradual reduction in endothelial cell density over time can lead to loss of clarity and require repeating the procedure. Patients with endothelial transplants frequently achieve best corrected vision in the 20/30 to 20/40 range, although some reach 20/20. Optical irregularity at the graft/host interface may limit vision below 20/20. ==Synthetic corneas== ===Boston keratoprosthesis=== Boston Kpro type 1 titanium posterior plate The Boston keratoprosthesis is the most widely used synthetic cornea to date with over 900 procedures performed worldwide in 2008. The Boston KPro was developed at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary under the leadership of Claes Dohlman, MD, PhD. ===AlphaCor=== In cases where there have been several graft failures or the risk for keratoplasty is high, synthetic corneas can substitute successfully for donor corneas. Such a device contains a peripheral skirt and a transparent central region. These two parts are connected on a molecular level by an interpenetrating polymer network, made from poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA). AlphaCor is a U.S. FDA-approved type of synthetic cornea measuring 7.0 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The main advantages of synthetic corneas are that they are biocompatible, and the network between the parts and the device prevents complications that could arise at their interface. The probability of retention in one large study was estimated at 62% at 2 years follow-up. ===Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis=== In a very rare and complex multi-step surgical procedure, employed to help the most disabled patients, a lamina of the person's tooth is grafted into the eye, with an artificial lens installed in the transplanted piece. ==Prognosis== The prognosis for visual restoration and maintenance of ocular health with corneal transplants is generally very good. Risks for failure or guarded prognoses are multifactorial. The type of transplant, the disease state requiring the procedure, the health of the other parts of the recipient eye and even the health of the donor tissue may all confer a more or less favorable prognosis. The majority of corneal transplants result in significant improvement in visual function for many years or a lifetime. In cases of rejection or transplant failure, the surgery can generally be repeated. ==Alternatives== ===Contact lenses=== Different types of contact lenses may be used to delay or eliminate the need for corneal transplantation in corneal disorders. ===Phototherapeutic keratectomy=== Diseases that only affect the surface of the cornea can be treated with an operation called phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). With the precision of an excimer laser and a modulating agent coating the eye, irregularities on the surface can be removed. However, in most of the cases where corneal transplantation is recommended, PTK would not be effective. ===Intrastromal corneal ring segments=== In corneal disorders where vision correction is not possible by using contact lenses, intrastromal corneal ring segments may be used to flatten the cornea, which is intended to relieve the nearsightedness and astigmatism. In this procedure, an ophthalmologist makes an incision in the cornea of the eye, and inserts two crescent or semi-circular shaped ring segments between the layers of the corneal stroma, one on each side of the pupil. Intrastromal corneal rings were approved in 2004 by the Food and Drug Administration for people with keratoconus who cannot adequately correct their vision with glasses or contact lenses. They were approved under the Humanitarian Device Exemption, which means the manufacturer did not have to demonstrate effectiveness. ===Corneal collagen cross-linking=== Corneal collagen cross-linking may delay or eliminate the need for corneal transplantation in keratoconus and post-LASIK ectasia, however as of 2015 it is lacking sufficient evidence to determine if it is useful in keratoconus. ==Epidemiology== Corneal transplant is one of the most common transplant procedures. Although approximately 100,000 procedures are performed worldwide each year, some estimates report that 10,000,000 people are affected by various disorders that would benefit from corneal transplantation. In Australia, approximately 2,000 grafts are performed each year. According to the NHS Blood and Transplant, over 2,300 corneal transplant procedures are performed each year in the United Kingdom. Between April 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006, 2,503 people received corneal transplants in the UK. ==History== Eduard Zirm Spanish-born eye surgeon Ramon Castroviejo successfully performed keratoplasty as early as 1936. The first cornea transplant was performed in 1905 by Eduard Zirm (Olomouc Eye Clinic, now Czech Republic), making it one of the first types of transplant surgery successfully performed. Another pioneer of the operation was Ramon Castroviejo. Russian eye surgeon Vladimir Filatov's attempts at transplanting cornea started with the first try in 1912 and were continued, gradually improving until on 6 May 1931 he successfully grafted a patient using corneal tissue from a deceased person.Vladimir Filatov, peoples.ru He widely reported another transplant in 1936, disclosing his technique in full detail.Eye repair - TIME, Monday, Apr. 13, 1936 In 1936, Castroviejo did a first transplantation in an advanced case of keratoconus, achieving significant improvement in patient's vision.Castroviejo, R.: International Abstract of Surgery, 65:5, December, 1937. Tudor Thomas, a clinical teacher for the Welsh National School of Medicine, conceived the idea of a donor system for corneal grafts and an eye bank was established in East Grinstead in 1955.Pioneers & Personalities Cardiff University Advances in operating microscopes enabled surgeons to have a more magnified view of the surgical field, while advances in materials science enabled them to use sutures finer than a human hair. Instrumental in the success of cornea transplants were the establishment of eye banks. These are organizations located throughout the world to coordinate the distribution of donated corneas to surgeons, as well as providing eyes for research. Some eye banks also distribute other anatomical gifts. ==Research== ===High speed lasers=== Blades are being replaced by high speed lasers in order to make surgical incisions more precise. These improved incisions allow the cornea to heal more quickly and the sutures to be removed sooner. The cornea heals more strongly than with standard blade operations. Not only does this dramatically improve visual recovery and healing, it also allows the possibility for improvement in visual outcomes. Since 2004, Amnitrans Eyebank in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, provides donor corneas pre-cut for advanced keratoplasty procedures, such as DSEK, DSAEK, FS-DSEK and DMEK. In 2007, Seattle-based SightLife, one of the leading corneal tissue banks in the world, introduced a process for the preparation of donated corneal tissue using a Femtosecond Laser. This process is known as custom corneal tissue. ===DSEK/DSAEK/DMEK=== Endothelial keratoplasty (EK) has been introduced by Melles et al. in 1998. Today there are three forms of EK. Deep Lamellar Endothelial Keratoplasty (DLEK) in which the posterior part of the recipient cornea is replaced by donor tissue. Descemet's Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK/DSAEK) in which the diseased Descemet's membrane is removed and replaced by a healthy donor posterior transplant. The transplant tissue can be prepared by a surgeon's hand or ordered already prepared for surgery. Ocular Systems was the first organization to deliver prepared grafts for surgery in 2005. DSEK/DSAEK uses only a small incision that is either self-sealing or may be closed with a few sutures. The small incision offers several benefits over traditional methods of corneal transplant such as Penetrating Keratoplasty. Because the procedure is less invasive, DSAEK leaves the eye much stronger and less prone to injury than full-thickness transplants. New medical devices such as the EndoSaver (patent pending) are designed to ease process of inserting endothelial tissue into the cornea.Evans, Matt. Triad Business Journal, February 6, 2009. Additionally, DSAEK has a more rapid rate of visual recovery. Vision is typically restored in one to six months rather than one to two years. Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) is the most recent EK technique in which an isolated Descemet membrane is transplanted. The DMEK procedure is a 'like for like' replacement of the diseased part of the cornea with visual rehabilitation to 20/40 or better in 90% of cases and 20/25 or better in 60% of cases within the first three months. Rejection rates are lower (1%) and visual recovery is faster than any other form of corneal transplantation. In the UK (2013) DMEK is available to patients under the National Health Service at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust.\\"Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust website\\" and at Worthing Hospital (Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).Worthing Herald News, 21 Nov 2014 Not all patients with diseased corneas are candidates for endothelial keratoplasty. These procedures correct corneal endothelial failure, but are not able to correct corneal scarring, thinning, or surface irregularity. There is currently limited data on long-term survival of DMEK grafts however the early indications are very positive. An upcoming systematic review will seek to compare the safety and effectiveness of DMEK versus DSAEK in people with corneal failure from Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. ===Stem cells=== There is a bioengineering technique that uses stem cells to create corneas or part of corneas that can be transplanted into the eyes. Corneal stem cells are removed from a healthy cornea. They are collected and, through laboratory procedures, made into five to ten layers of cells that can be stitched into a patient's eye. The stem cells are placed into the area where the damaged cornea tissue has been removed. This is a good alternative for those that cannot gain vision through regular cornea transplants. A new development, announced by the University of Cincinnati Medical School in May 2007, would use bone marrow stem cells to regrow the cornea and its cells. This technique, which proved successful in mouse trials, would be of use to those suffering from inherited genetic degenerative conditions of the cornea, especially if other means like a transplant aren't feasible. It works better than a transplant because these stem cells keep their ability to differentiate and replicate, and so keep the disease from recurring, longer and better. ===Biosynthetic corneas=== On 25 August 2010 investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas. Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision. Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant. To make the material, the researchers placed a human gene that regulates the natural production of collagen into specially programmed yeast cells. They then molded the resulting material into the shape of a cornea. This research shows the potential for these bioengineered corneas but the outcomes in this study were not nearly as good as those achieved with human donor corneas. This may become an excellent technique, but right now it is still in the prototype stage and not ready for clinical use. The results were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Salynn Boyles. WebMD, August 25, 2010. == Society and culture == === Cost === A 2013 cost-benefit analysis by the Lewin Group for Eye Bank Association of America, estimated an average cost of $16,500 for each corneal transplant. ==References== ==External links== *Facts About the Cornea and Corneal Disease The National Eye Institute (NEI) Category:Tissue transplants Category:Eye surgery ","title":"Corneal transplantation"},{"id":"1425135","text":"Willis Laurence James (September 18, 1900 – December 27, 1966) was an American musician, composer and educator. He was on the faculty of Spelman College for more than three decades.Megan Hill, \\"Willis Laurence James – MBC visits the Spelman College Archives\\", MBC (Music by Black Composers) Blog, May 17, 2017. ==Biography== Willis James was born in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, and was raised in Pensacola and Jacksonville, Florida. Educated at the Florida Baptist Academy in Jacksonville, he studied violin with Sidney Woodward. Woodward recognized his musical talent and took James for further study to Atlanta, Georgia, where from the age of 16 he was the protégé of Kemper Harreld, a concert violinist and head of the Morehouse College music department. James enrolled at Morehouse in 1919, and his studies included the traditional core of music courses, as well as the violin and several other instruments. He was a member of the Morehouse Quartet and Glee Club, and played violin in the college orchestra. James showed great promise as a concert violinist and performed as a recitalist and soloist throughout his career. After receiving his B.A. from Morehouse in 1923, James pursued further study with Oswald Blake and Edwin Gerschefski at the Chicago Musical College. James began his teaching career at Leland College in Baker, Louisiana (1923–29), and it was while living in Louisiana that he began collecting folklore and folksongs, particularly along the levees of the Mississippi River. In 1927 the Paramount Record Company of Chicago released a record on which he sang folksongs and for which he and James Edward Halligan transcribed the music and texts. In 1928 James married a fellow teacher at Leland College, Theodora Joanna Fisher. From 1929 to 1933, he taught at the Alabama State Teachers College at Montgomery, before accepting a teaching position at Spelman College, where he would stay for the remainder of his career, serving as chairman of the music department and director of the Spelman College Glee Club. After the retirement of Kemper Harreld, he assumed the duties of director of music at both Morehouse and Spelman Colleges, and secured Joyce Johnson as Spelman College organist. With Horace Mann Bond, president of Fort Valley State College, James co-founded the Fort Valley State College Folk Festival (1940–55), and was a member of the summer faculty there from 1941 to 1949. James continued investigating folksongs over the years and was noted for his compositions and arrangements. His theory that \\"the cry\\" was the most distinctive feature of black folksong attracted some attention. He lectured at college campuses, before professional societies, at the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals, and at the Roundtables of the Tanglewood music festival. He received awards from the General Education Board and the Carnegie Foundation and in 1955 received an honorary doctorate from Wilberforce University. In April 1966, he lectured at the opening of the Center for the Arts in Lagos, Nigeria. At the time of his death on December 27, 1966, he left a completed manuscript, Stars in De Elements, which was published in 1995 as a special issue of the journal Black Sacred Music. ==References== * Eileen Southern (1997).

The inner layer that covers organs (viscera) in body cavities is called the visceral membrane. A second layer of epithelial cells of the serous membrane, called the parietal layer, lines the body wall. Between the two layers is a potential space, mostly empty except for a few milliliters of lubricating serous fluid that is secreted by the two serous membranes. The Latin anatomical name is tunica serosa. Serous membranes line and enclose several body cavities, known as serous cavities, where they secrete a lubricating fluid which reduces friction from muscle movement. Serosa is entirely different from the adventitia, a connective tissue layer which binds together structures rather than reducing friction between them. The serous membrane covering the heart and lining the mediastinum is referred to as the pericardium, the serous membrane lining the thoracic cavity and surrounding the lungs is referred to as the pleura, and that lining the abdominopelvic cavity and the viscera is referred to as the peritoneum. ==Structure== Serous membranes have two layers. The parietal layers of the membranes line the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organs (the viscera). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid- filled serous space, or cavity. ===Visceral and parietal layers=== Each serous membrane is composed of a secretory epithelial layer and a connective tissue layer underneath. * The epithelial layer, known as mesothelium, consists of a single layer of avascular flat nucleated cells (simple squamous epithelium) which produce the lubricating serous fluid. This fluid has a consistency similar to thin mucus. These cells are bound tightly to the underlying connective tissue. * The connective tissue layer provides the blood vessels and nerves for the overlying secretory cells, and also serves as the binding layer which allows the whole serous membrane to adhere to organs and other structures. For the heart, the layers of the serous membrane are called the parietal pericardium, and the visceral pericardium (sometimes called the epicardium). Other parts of the body may also have specific names for these structures. For example, the serosa of the uterus is called the perimetrium. Schematic diagram of an organ invaginating into a serous cavity The pericardial cavity (surrounding the heart), pleural cavity (surrounding the lungs) and peritoneal cavity (surrounding most organs of the abdomen) are the three serous cavities within the human body. While serous membranes have a lubricative role to play in all three cavities, in the pleural cavity it has a greater role to play in the function of breathing. The serous cavities are formed from the intraembryonic coelom and are basically an empty space within the body surrounded by serous membrane. Early in embryonic life visceral organs develop adjacent to a cavity and invaginate into the bag-like coelom. Therefore, each organ becomes surrounded by serous membrane - they do not lie within the serous cavity. The layer in contact with the organ is known as the visceral layer, while the parietal layer is in contact with the body wall. ===Examples=== In the human body, there are three serous cavities with associated serous membranes: *A serous membrane lines the pericardial cavity of the heart, and reflects back to cover the heart, much like an under- inflated balloon would form two layers surrounding a fist. Called the pericardium, this serous membrane is a two-layered sac that surrounds the entire heart except where blood vessels emerge on the heart’s superior side; *The pleura is the serous membrane that surrounds the lungs in the pleural cavity; *The peritoneum is the serous membrane that surrounds several organs in the abdominopelvic cavity. *The tunica vaginalis is the serous membrane, which surrounds the male gonad, the testis. The two layers of serous membranes are named parietal and visceral. Between the two layers is a thin fluid filled space. The fluid is produced by the serous membranes and stays between the two layers to reduce friction between the walls of the cavities and the internal organs when they move with respect to one another, such as when the lungs inflate or the heart beats. Such movement could otherwise lead to inflammation of the organs. ===Development=== All serous membranes found in the human body formed ultimately from the mesoderm of the trilaminar embryo. The trilaminar embryo consists of three relatively flat layers of ectoderm, endoderm (also known as \\"entoderm\\") and mesoderm. As the embryo develops, the mesoderm starts to segment into three main regions: the paraxial mesoderm, the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm. The lateral plate mesoderm later splits in half to form two layers bounding a cavity known as the intraembryonic coelom. Individually, each layer is known as splanchnopleure and somatopleure. * The splanchnopleure is associated with the underlying endoderm with which it is in contact, and later becomes the serous membrane in contact with visceral organs within the body. * The somatopleure is associated with the overlying ectoderm and later becomes the serous membrane in contact with the body wall. The intraembryonic coelom can now be seen as a cavity within the body which is covered with serous membrane derived from the splanchnopleure. This cavity is divided and demarcated by the folding and development of the embryo, ultimately forming the serous cavities which house many different organs within the thorax and abdomen. ==Anatomical images== Image:Illu stomach layers.jpgLayers of stomach wall Image:Gray1058.pngSection of duodenum of cat ==See also== * Adventitia ==References== This Wikipedia entry incorporates text from the freely licensed Connexions edition of Anatomy & Physiology text-book by OpenStax College ==External links== * * Category:Membrane biology Category:Tissues (biology) ","title":"Serous membrane"},{"id":"1425185","text":"In differential geometry, a spray is a vector field H on the tangent bundle TM that encodes a quasilinear second order system of ordinary differential equations on the base manifold M. Usually a spray is required to be homogeneous in the sense that its integral curves t→ΦHt(ξ)∈TM obey the rule ΦHt(λξ)=ΦHλt(ξ) in positive reparameterizations. If this requirement is dropped, H is called a semispray. Sprays arise naturally in Riemannian and Finsler geometry as the geodesic sprays, whose integral curves are precisely the tangent curves of locally length minimizing curves. Semisprays arise naturally as the extremal curves of action integrals in Lagrangian mechanics. Generalizing all these examples, any (possibly nonlinear) connection on M induces a semispray H, and conversely, any semispray H induces a torsion-free nonlinear connection on M. If the original connection is torsion-free it coincides with the connection induced by H, and homogeneous torsion-free connections are in one-to-one correspondence with full sprays.I. Bucataru, R.

Then a vector field H on TM (that is, a section of the double tangent bundle TTM) is a semispray on M, if any of the three following equivalent conditions holds: * (πTM)*Hξ = ξ. * JH=V, where J is the tangent structure on TM and V is the canonical vector field on TM\\\\0. * j∘H=H, where j:TTM→TTM is the canonical flip and H is seen as a mapping TM→TTM. A semispray H on M is a (full) spray if any of the following equivalent conditions hold: * Hλξ = λ*(λHξ), where λ*:TTM→TTM is the push-forward of the multiplication λ:TM→TM by a positive scalar λ>0. * The Lie-derivative of H along the canonical vector field V satisfies [V,H]=H. * The integral curves t→ΦHt(ξ)∈TM\\\\0 of H satisfy ΦHt(λξ)=λΦHλt(ξ) for any λ>0. Let (xi,ξi) be the local coordinates on TM associated with the local coordinates (xi) on M using the coordinate basis on each tangent space. Then H is a semispray on M if and only if it has a local representation of the form : H_\\\\xi = \\\\xi^i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\Big_{(x,\\\\xi)} - 2G^i(x,\\\\xi)\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^i}\\\\Big_{(x,\\\\xi)}. on each associated coordinate system on TM. The semispray H is a (full) spray, if and only if the spray coefficients Gi satisfy :G^i(x,\\\\lambda\\\\xi) = \\\\lambda^2G^i(x,\\\\xi),\\\\quad \\\\lambda>0.\\\\, == Semisprays in Lagrangian mechanics == A physical system is modeled in Lagrangian mechanics by a Lagrangian function L:TM→R on the tangent bundle of some configuration space M. The dynamical law is obtained from the Hamiltonian principle, which states that the time evolution γ:[a,b]→M of the state of the system is stationary for the action integral :\\\\mathcal S(\\\\gamma) := \\\\int_a^b L(\\\\gamma(t),\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t))dt. In the associated coordinates on TM the first variation of the action integral reads as :\\\\frac{d}{ds}\\\\Big_{s=0}\\\\mathcal S(\\\\gamma_s) = \\\\Big_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^i}X^i - \\\\int_a^b \\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^j\\\\partial \\\\xi^i} \\\\ddot\\\\gamma^j \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial x^j\\\\partial\\\\xi^i} \\\\dot\\\\gamma^j - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\Big) X^i dt, where X:[a,b]→R is the variation vector field associated with the variation γs:[a,b]→M around γ(t) = γ0(t). This first variation formula can be recast in a more informative form by introducing the following concepts: * The covector \\\\alpha_\\\\xi = \\\\alpha_i(x,\\\\xi) dx^i_x\\\\in T_x^*M with \\\\alpha_i(x,\\\\xi) = \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^i}(x,\\\\xi) is the conjugate momentum of \\\\xi \\\\in T_xM . * The corresponding one-form \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\Omega^1(TM) with \\\\alpha_\\\\xi = \\\\alpha_i(x,\\\\xi) dx^i_{(x,\\\\xi)}\\\\in T^*_\\\\xi TM is the Hilbert-form associated with the Lagrangian. * The bilinear form g_\\\\xi = g_{ij}(x,\\\\xi)(dx^i\\\\otimes dx^j)_x with g_{ij}(x,\\\\xi) = \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^i \\\\partial \\\\xi^j}(x,\\\\xi) is the fundamental tensor of the Lagrangian at \\\\xi \\\\in T_xM . * The Lagrangian satisfies the Legendre condition if the fundamental tensor \\\\displaystyle g_\\\\xi is non- degenerate at every \\\\xi \\\\in T_xM . Then the inverse matrix of \\\\displaystyle g_{ij}(x,\\\\xi) is denoted by \\\\displaystyle g^{ij}(x,\\\\xi). * The Energy associated with the Lagrangian is \\\\displaystyle E(\\\\xi) = \\\\alpha_\\\\xi(\\\\xi) - L(\\\\xi). If the Legendre condition is satisfied, then dα∈Ω2(TM) is a symplectic form, and there exists a unique Hamiltonian vector field H on TM corresponding to the Hamiltonian function E such that :\\\\displaystyle dE = - \\\\iota_H d\\\\alpha. Let (Xi,Yi) be the components of the Hamiltonian vector field H in the associated coordinates on TM. Then : \\\\iota_H d\\\\alpha = Y^i \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^i\\\\partial x^j} dx^j - X^i \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^i\\\\partial x^j} d\\\\xi^j and : dE = \\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial x^i \\\\partial \\\\xi^j}\\\\xi^j - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\Big)dx^i + \\\\xi^j \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^i\\\\partial x^j} d\\\\xi^i so we see that the Hamiltonian vector field H is a semispray on the configuration space M with the spray coefficients :G^k(x,\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{g^{ki}}{2}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 L}{\\\\partial\\\\xi^i\\\\partial x^j}\\\\xi^j - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\Big). Now the first variational formula can be rewritten as :\\\\frac{d}{ds}\\\\Big_{s=0}\\\\mathcal S(\\\\gamma_s) = \\\\Big_a^b \\\\alpha_i X^i - \\\\int_a^b g_{ik}(\\\\ddot\\\\gamma^k+2G^k)X^i dt, and we see γ[a,b]→M is stationary for the action integral with fixed end points if and only if its tangent curve γ':[a,b]→TM is an integral curve for the Hamiltonian vector field H. Hence the dynamics of mechanical systems are described by semisprays arising from action integrals. == Geodesic spray == The locally length minimizing curves of Riemannian and Finsler manifolds are called geodesics. Using the framework of Lagrangian mechanics one can describe these curves with spray structures. Define a Lagrangian function on TM by :L(x,\\\\xi) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}F^2(x,\\\\xi), where F:TM→R is the Finsler function. In the Riemannian case one uses F2(x,ξ) = gij(x)ξiξj. Now introduce the concepts from the section above. In the Riemannian case it turns out that the fundamental tensor gij(x,ξ) is simply the Riemannian metric gij(x). In the general case the homogeneity condition :F(x,\\\\lambda\\\\xi) = \\\\lambda F(x,\\\\xi), \\\\quad \\\\lambda>0 of the Finsler-function implies the following formulae: : \\\\alpha_i=g_{ij}\\\\xi^i, \\\\quad F^2=g_{ij}\\\\xi^i\\\\xi^j, \\\\quad E = \\\\alpha_i\\\\xi^i - L = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}F^2. In terms of classical mechanical the last equation states that all the energy in the system (M,L) is in the kinetic form. Furthermore, one obtains the homogeneity properties : g_{ij}(\\\\lambda\\\\xi) = g_{ij}(\\\\xi), \\\\quad \\\\alpha_i(x,\\\\lambda\\\\xi) = \\\\lambda \\\\alpha_i(x,\\\\xi), \\\\quad G^i(x,\\\\lambda\\\\xi) = \\\\lambda^2 G^i(x,\\\\xi), of which the last one says that the Hamiltonian vector field H for this mechanical system is a full spray. The constant speed geodesics of the underlying Finsler (or Riemannian) manifold are described by this spray for the following reasons: * Since gξ is positive definite for Finsler spaces, every short enough stationary curve for the length functional is length minimizing. * Every stationary curve for the action integral is of constant speed F(\\\\gamma(t),\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t))=\\\\lambda, since the energy is automatically a constant of motion. * For any curve \\\\gamma:[a,b]\\\\to M of constant speed the action integral and the length functional are related by : \\\\mathcal S(\\\\gamma) = \\\\frac{(b-a)\\\\lambda^2}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\ell(\\\\gamma)^2}{2(b-a)}. Therefore, a curve \\\\gamma:[a,b]\\\\to M is stationary to the action integral if and only if it is of constant speed and stationary to the length functional. The Hamiltonian vector field H is called the geodesic spray of the Finsler manifold (M,F) and the corresponding flow ΦHt(ξ) is called the geodesic flow. == Correspondence with nonlinear connections == A semispray H on a smooth manifold M defines an Ehresmann- connection T(TM\\\\0) = H(TM\\\\0) ⊕ V(TM\\\\0) on the slit tangent bundle through its horizontal and vertical projections : h:T(TM\\\\setminus 0)\\\\to T(TM\\\\setminus 0) \\\\quad ; \\\\quad h = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\big( I - \\\\mathcal L_H J \\\\big), : v:T(TM\\\\setminus 0)\\\\to T(TM\\\\setminus 0) \\\\quad ; \\\\quad v = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\big( I + \\\\mathcal L_H J \\\\big). This connection on TM\\\\0 always has a vanishing torsion tensor, which is defined as the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket T=[J,v]. In more elementary terms the torsion can be defined as :\\\\displaystyle T(X,Y) = J[hX,hY] - v[JX,hY) - v[hX,JY]. Introducing the canonical vector field V on TM\\\\0 and the adjoint structure Θ of the induced connection the horizontal part of the semispray can be written as hH=ΘV. The vertical part ε=vH of the semispray is known as the first spray invariant, and the semispray H itself decomposes into :\\\\displaystyle H = \\\\Theta V + \\\\epsilon. The first spray invariant is related to the tension : \\\\tau = \\\\mathcal L_Vv = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\mathcal L_{[V,H]-H} J of the induced non-linear connection through the ordinary differential equation : \\\\mathcal L_V\\\\epsilon+\\\\epsilon = \\\\tau\\\\Theta V. Therefore, the first spray invariant ε (and hence the whole semi-spray H) can be recovered from the non-linear connection by : \\\\epsilon_\\\\xi = \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^0 e^{-s}(\\\\Phi_V^{-s})_*(\\\\tau\\\\Theta V)_{\\\\Phi_V^s(\\\\xi)} ds. From this relation one also sees that the induced connection is homogeneous if and only if H is a full spray. == Jacobi fields of sprays and semisprays == A good source for Jacobi fields of semisprays is Section 4.4, Jacobi equations of a semispray of the publicly available book Finsler-Lagrange Geometry by Bucătaru and Miron. Of particular note is their concept of a dynamical covariant derivative. In another paper Bucătaru, Constantinescu and Dahl relate this concept to that of the Kosambi biderivative operator. For a good introduction to Kosambi's methods, see the article, What is Kosambi-Cartan-Chern theory?. ==References== * . * . Category:Differential geometry Category:Finsler geometry ","title":"Spray (mathematics)"},{"id":"1425194","text":"Inle Lake (, ), a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Taunggyi District of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar (Burma). It is the second largest lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of , and one of the highest at an elevation of . During the dry season, the average water depth is , with the deepest point being . During the rainy season, this can increase by . The watershed area for the lake lies to a large extent to the north and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring on its northwestern shore. Large sections of the lake are covered by floating plants. Its clear and slightly alkaline waters (pH 7.8–8) are home to a diverse fauna and many species found nowhere else in the world (endemics). There are more than 35 native species of fish, including 17 endemics. Some of these, notably the Sawbwa barb, red dwarf rasbora, emerald dwarf rasbora, Lake Inle danio, Inle loach and the Inle snakehead, are of minor commercial importance for the aquarium trade. Several fish that are not native have been introduced. Additionally, the lake is home to about 45 species of freshwater snails, 30 of them endemic, along with a small endemic freshwater crab, Inlethelphusa acanthica. It hosts approximately 20,000 migratory gulls in November to January. Page 16 Col 1 In June 2015, it became Myanmar's first designated place of World Network of Biosphere Reserves. It was one of 20 places added at the Unesco's 27th Man and the Biosphere (MAB) International Coordinating Council (ICC) meeting. Since 2018 it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site. Today the lake's environment is under serious pressure due to pollution, siltation, eutrophication, overfishing and introduced species, including the highly invasive water hyacinth. The endemic predatory fish Systomus compressiformis might already be extinct. ==People and culture== The people of Inle Lake (see Intha), live in four cities bordering the lake, in numerous small villages along the lake's shores, and on the lake itself. The entire lake area is in Nyaung Shwe township. The population consists predominantly of Intha, with a mix of other Shan, Taungyo, Pa-O (Taungthu), Danu, Kayah, Danaw and Bamar ethnicities. Most are devout Buddhists and live in simple houses of wood and woven bamboo on stilts; they are largely self-sufficient farmers. Transportation on the lake is traditionally by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder inboard diesel engines. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by reeds and floating plants, making it difficult to see above them while sitting. Standing provides the rower with a view beyond the reeds. However, the leg rowing style is only practiced by the men. Women row in the customary style, using the oar with their hands, sitting cross legged at the stern. Fish caught from the lake - the historically most abundant kind is called nga hpein locally (Inle carp, Cyprinus intha) - has been a staple of the local diet. Today this carp is seriously threatened. A popular local dish is htamin gyin - 'fermented' rice kneaded with fish and/or potato - served with hnapyan gyaw (literally twice fried - Shan tofu). In addition to fishing, locals grow vegetables and fruit in large gardens that float on the surface of the lake. The floating garden beds are formed by extensive manual labor. The farmers gather up lake-bottom weeds from the deeper parts of the lake, bring them back in boats and make them into floating beds in their garden areas, anchored by bamboo poles. These gardens rise and fall with changes in the water level, and so are resistant to flooding. The constant availability of nutrient-laden water results in these gardens being incredibly fertile. Rice cultivation and consumption is also significant facet of the local diet and agricultural tradition.

Image:Harvesting weeds on Inle Lake.JPGOn the way home from harvesting weeds in the lake Image:Water hyacinth Inle Lake.JPGFloating farm ==Environmental concerns== Inle Lake is suffering from the environmental effects of increased population and rapid growth in both agriculture and tourism. During the 65-year period from 1935 to 2000, the net open water area of Inle Lake decreased from 69.10 km2 to 46.69 km2, a loss of 32.4%, with development of floating garden agriculture, which occurs largely on the west side of the lake (a practice introduced in the 1960s). Lumber removal and unsustainable cultivation practices (slash and burn farming techniques) on the hills surrounding the lake are causing ever-increasing amounts of silt and nutrients to run off into the rivers that feed the lake, especially along its western and northern watershed areas. This silt fills up the lake; the nutrients encourage the growth of weeds and algae. More important however is the development of floating garden agriculture, largely along the western side of the lake. This practice encroaches into the diminishing area of the lake, since over time, the floating beds become solid ground. About 93% (nearly 21 km2) of the recent loss in open water area of the lake, largely along its western side, is thought to be due to this agricultural practice. Direct environmental impacts associated with these combined agricultural activities within the wetlands and surrounding hills of the lake include sedimentation, eutrophication, and pollution. The water hyacinth, a plant not native to the lake, also poses a major problem. It grows rapidly, filling up the smaller streams and large expanses of the lake, robbing native plants and animals of nutrients and sunlight. At one time, all boats coming into Nyaung Shwe were required to bring in a specified amount of water hyacinth. Over the past twenty years, large-scale use of dredges and pumps has been employed with some success in controlling the growth of this plant. On a smaller scale, public awareness education and small-scale control have also been successful. Another cause for concern is the planned introduction of non-native fish species, such as the Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) intended to improve fishery. Sanitation in the villages around the lake is an ongoing concern for public health authorities, due to untreated sewage (with 72% of households using open pits, not latrines) and waste water flowing into the lake. To ensure fresh and clean water, some villages now have enclosed wells and public access to the well water. Some studies of the lake's surface water quality indicates that the water is not safe for consumption. Water from Inle Lake has dissolved oxygen ranges lower than those necessary for fisheries and aquatic life, while nitrite, nitrate and phosphate ranges are unusually high. Noise pollution is also a noticeable issue. The noise from the cheaper poorly muffled diesel engines driving the stern drive propellers is significant, and can be a distraction to the otherwise tranquil lake. The summer of 2010 registered very high temperatures causing the water level of the lake to drop so low, the lowest in nearly 50 years, that drinking water had to be fetched from elsewhere and the floating market was in danger of disappearing. One other serious consequence was that the hydroelectric plant at Lawpita, where the former capital Yangon received its power supply from, could not operate at its full capacity. In 2015, the United Nations added Inle lake to its World Network Biosphere Reserves. There are a total of 651 sites in 120 countries on this network, but Inle Lake is the first biosphere reserve to be added for Myanmar. == Tourism == Boat carrying tourists Religious event in Inle Lake Inle Lake is a major tourist attraction, and this has led to some development of tourist infrastructure. Many small and large privately-owned hotels and tour operations have arisen during the past few years. Local shops are flooded with consumer items, both local and foreign. The nearest airport is Heho Airport which is 35 km away. There are flights from both Yangon and Mandalay. Yangon is 660 km away by road and Mandalay is 330 km. A number of festivals occur from August to October on Inle Lake and in the surrounding areas. The ceremonial Hpaung Daw U Festival, which lasts for a total of 18 days, is closely followed by the Thadingyut Festival of lights. Inthas and Shan turn out in their best clothes in great numbers to celebrate the Buddhist Lent. Traditional boat racing, with dozens of leg-rowers in traditional Shan dress compete on teams with a team on each boat. These boat races are locally one of the most anticipated affairs during the Hpaung Daw U Festival. One of the tourist attractions in the village on the lake itself is the traditional silversmithing, which has fed into the local tourist economy. The silver is brought in from the mines that line the hills surrounding the lake and is boated into the village. Almost all the houses in the village on the lake itself sit on stilts and are made of woven bamboo. Tourists can satisfy their need for trinkets and memorable tokens by observing the silver being smithed and purchase items on-site. If silversmithing doesn't interest a visitor there are also local silk workshops that operate on the lake in a very similar manner as the silversmiths. Handmade goods for local use and trading are another source of commerce. Typical products include tools, carvings and other ornamental objects, textiles, and cheroots. A local market serves most common shopping needs and is held daily but the location of the event rotates through five different sites around the lake area, thus each of them hosting an itinerant market every fifth day. When held on the lake itself, trading is conducted from small boats. This 'floating-market' event tends to emphasize tourist trade much more than the other four. The Inle lake area is renowned for its weaving industry. The Shan-bags, used daily by many Burmese as a tote- bag, are produced in large quantities here. Silk-weaving is another very important industry, producing high-quality hand-woven silk fabrics of distinctive design called Inle longyi. A unique fabric from the lotus plant fibers is produced only at Inle lake and is used for weaving special robes for Buddha images called kya thingahn (lotus robe). While hot air balloon flights are more popular in Bagan, they are also provided over Inle Lake with Balloons Over Bagan. There is also a winery near the lake, called Red Mountain Estate. ==Cuisine== Htamin Chin (fermented rice) served with hnapyan jaw (twice-fried Shan tofu) is a popular local dish. Inle cuisine is different from Shan cuisine, as it incorporates local natural produce. The most well-known Inle dish would be the Htamin Chin - a rice, tomato and potato or fish salad kneaded into round balls dressed and garnished with crisp fried onion in oil, tamarind sauce, coriander and spring onions often with garlic, Chinese chives roots (ju myit), fried whole dried chili, grilled dried fermented bean cakes (pè bouk) and fried dried tofu (topu jauk kyaw) on the side. ==See also== *Inlay Lake Wetland Sanctuary ==References== == External links == * * * Inle lake tourism * Large scale manufacture of Shan tofu at Inle Lake video * Inle Lake moving postcards * Inle Lake in Photos Category:Lakes of Myanmar Category:Tourist attractions in Myanmar Category:Ramsar sites in Myanmar Category:Geography of Shan State Category:Freshwater ecoregions Category:Shan Hills ","title":"Inle Lake"},{"id":"1425199","text":"William Earl McLellin (January 18, 1806 – April 24, 1883) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement. One of the original members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, McLellin later broke with church founder Joseph Smith. ==Biography== McLellin was born in Smith County, Tennessee, a son of Charles McLellin. He married for the first time on July 30, 1829, but his wife, Cynthia Ann McLellin, died young and he was a widower by 1832. McLellin married Emeline Miller on April 26, 1832 in Hiram, Ohio. Emeline was born September 4, 1809, in Pomfret, Vermont, to Martin Miller and Rebecca Jacobs. Emeline died November 1, 1907, in Grayson County, Texas. McLellin and Emeline were the parents of four sons and two daughters: Charles William, Sarah E., James Martin, Helen Rebecca, Albert Eugene, and Marcus Nelson. === Church service === McLellin first had contact with the missionaries of the Latter Day Saint Church of Christ in Paris, Tennessee, during 1831. He traveled to Missouri to further investigate the church, and was baptized on Aug 20, 1831The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsand ordained an elder. During 1831, he also traveled with Hyrum Smith, and the two of them preached in Tennessee. McLellin then relocated to Kirtland, Ohio. In 1832 and 1833, McLellin served a mission for the church, traveling with Parley P. Pratt. However, in a revelation to Joseph Smith on March 8, 1833, it was said that the Lord was \\"not pleased with my servant William E. McLellin\\".Doctrine and Covenants 90:35 (LDS Church ed). An experienced schoolteacher and a self- proclaimed physician, McLellin taught penmanship in the Kirtland School for Temporal Education in 1834. He served as a member of the church's high council in Clay County, Missouri, also in 1834, and was chosen and ordained to be one of the church's original twelve apostles on February 15, 1835, at age 29.B. H. Roberts (ed.) History of the Church, 2:187. When the Book of Commandments was about to be published, some Latter Day Saints criticized the wording of some of the revelations received by Smith. According to Smith, the Lord issued a challenge to see if the wisest member of the church could write a revelation comparable to the least of Smith's revelations. If they could, then the members of the church would be justified in claiming that the revelations did not come from God.Doctrine and Covenants 67:6-7 (LDS Church ed). McLellin, who was trained as a schoolteacher, was selected by the critics for the challenge. According to Smith's history, McLellin failed to produce a credible text, and the controversy died away.B. H. Roberts (ed.) History of the Church, 1:226. === Disassociation with the church === McLellin's association with the Latter Day Saint church came to an abrupt halt in 1838, when he declared that he had no confidence in the presidency of the church. This may have been due to the mismanagement of the church's financial institution, the Kirtland Safety Society. McLellin was excommunicated on May 11, 1838, and subsequently actively worked against the Latter Day Saints. According to members of the church, McLellin ransacked and robbed Smith's home and stable while Smith was being held in jail, pending charges on the Safety Society's financial problems. No charges were ever filed against Smith or against McLellin. A history published in the Latter Day Saint periodical Millennial Star in 1864 related the incident: > While Joseph was in prison at Richmond, Mo., Mr. McLellin, who was a large > and active man, went to the sheriff and asked for the privilege of flogging > the Prophet; permission was granted, on condition that Joseph would fight. > The sheriff made McLellin's earnest request known to Joseph, who consented > to fight, if his irons were taken off. McLellin then refused to fight, > unless he could have a club, to which Joseph was perfectly willing; but the > sheriff would not allow them to fight on such unequal terms.Brigham Young, > \\"History of Brigham Young\\", Millennial Star, 1864, vol. 26, p. 808. Previous to that incident, Smith authored a letter to the church from Liberty Jail on December 16, 1838, in which he made allusions to actions by McLellin that he vilified as sins.B. H. Roberts (ed.) History of the Church 3:224–33. In that letter, Smith likens McLellin to the biblical magician Balaam whose ass refused to help Balaam curse the leadership of the ancient Israelite church, in the era of Moses. The letter may have been what provoked McLellin to attempt to fist-fight Smith. After Smith's assassination in 1844, McLellin first accepted the succession claims of Sidney Rigdon and was appointed one of the Twelve Apostles in Rigdon's organization on April 8, 1845. In 1847, at Kirtland, Ohio, he joined with several others to create a reorganization of the church, designated the Church of Christ. McLellin called on David Whitmer to assume the presidency, claiming that Whitmer had been ordained by Smith as his successor on July 8, 1834. This organization was short lived. McLellin was also briefly associated with the movement led by James J. Strang, but more closely associated in the last two decades of his life with the movement led by Granville Hedrick. Although he was only briefly a member of Hedrick's organization in 1869,Grampa Bill's General Authority Pages: William E. McLellin: \\"He joined the Hedrickites on June 5, 1869 .... He left the Hedrickites November 3, 1869.\\" media reports from the 1870s describe McLellin as an enthusiastic but unofficial \\"tour guide\\" for the Temple Lot property, which the Hedrickites purchased from 1867 to 1877. McLellin died in Independence, Missouri. ==Personal writings== McLellin kept journals and notebooks during and after his time in the Latter Day Saint church. Because he was a prominent insider in the early church, these were of great interest to Latter Day Saint historians. In the early 1980s, collector Mark Hofmann claimed to have obtained the McLellin collection, which he described as embarrassing to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This generated interest that allowed Hofmann to sell it to two simultaneous buyers before being exposed as a counterfeiter when he killed two people to cover his crimes. In the aftermath of these crimes, the LDS Church discovered McLellin's writings were already in the church's possession, having been acquired and forgotten in 1908. These were later published in two works, The Journals of William E. McLellin, 1831–1836, edited by Jan Shipps and John W. Welch in 1994, and The William E. McLellin Papers, 1854–1880, edited by Stan Larson and Samuel J. Passey in 2007. However, these collections did not contain a certain notebook, which was known from photographs in a 1920s newspaper published by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In January 2009, this notebook was located and acquired by Brent Ashworth, one of the original collectors interested in Hofmann's supposed McLellin collection. ==Notes== == References == * . * Jenson, Andrew. editor.

At the age of 19, he joined the Army. He later participated in the Tenente revolts. He was a close collaborator of Vargas since his rise to power in 1930. Filinto Müller with Getúlio Vargas in 1938 Before and during World War II, he was sympathetic to Nazi Germany, which he visited in 1937 at the invitation of Heinrich Himmler. Also, he was one of the architects of the Estado Novo, which was characterized by the usage of large-scale torture (it is reported that sometimes he personally participated in torture sessions) and summary executions against political opponents (mostly communists). He was dismissed from his post when Vargas switched sides, approaching Brazil to the Allies against Adolf Hitler. ==Senator== In 1945 he was one of the founders of the pro-Vargas Social Democracy Party. In 1947 he was elected Senator for the state of Mato Grosso. In 1950 he stood for the post of governor of the same state, but was defeated. He was reelected as senator in 1955 and 1962. In the Senate, he was a supporter of the Kubitschek government. After the military coup of 1964, he joined the pro-regime party ARENA, and soon became its leader. He was reelected Senator in 1970. In 1973 he became President of the Senate. ==Death== He died on Varig Flight 820 in France while in office in 1973, on his 73rd birthday. The plane caught on fire, causing it to crash. After his death he was honored as a national hero. Filinto has since been honored publicly by several officials and intellectuals, among them Juscelino Kubitschek and Ulysses Guimarães. On the same flight were his wife, Consuelo, and his grandson, Pedro, who was only sixteen at the time. ==Personal life== Müller was married to Basque Consuelo de la Lastra, and they had two biological daughters: Maria Luiza Müller de Almeida (named after Consuelo's older sister, María Luísa de la Lastra), and Rita Julia Lastra Müller. Together, they adopted de la Lastra's niece, Argentinian-born Basque María Luísa Beatriz del Rio Lastra. Müller is the adoptive great-grandfather of Brazilian-born British writer/musician Beatriz del Rio. ==References== ==External links== * Filinto Müller Biography at CPDOC FGV Category:1900 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from Cuiabá Category:Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945–65) politicians Category:National Renewal Alliance politicians Category:Presidents of the Federal Senate Category:Members of the Federal Senate Category:Brazilian anti-communists Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in France Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1973 ","title":"Filinto Müller"},{"id":"1425206","text":"Camille Nickerson (1888-1982) was a pianist, composer, arranger, collector, and Howard University professor from 1926-1962\\\\.

The Jam Factory is owned by Newmark Capital Limited. It is also the headquarters of Village Roadshow. ==History== The Jam Factory was originally established as the Victorian Brewery in 1858, having a value of 150 pounds. The brewery shut down in 1876, with the building and land then being purchased the same year by Robert Wright and Robert Payne, who started the Victoria Preserving Company. By 1880, it was named the Red Cross preserving company. During the fruit season it employed 230 people, and was the largest employer in Prahran. Mr William Peacock bought the premises and turned it into the 'OK' Jam Co in 1895 and resold it to Henry Jones of the Henry Jones IXL Pty Ltd company and the Henry Jones IXL household brand name. Jam production continued in the building for this firm until 1970. At a cost of $20 million the site was redeveloped and opened on 9 October 1979 as a shopping centre catering to modern fashions, and in 1995 was redeveloped as the Jam Factory. The shopping centre also housed the first Australian Borders shop opening in 1998. It has since closed, along with the rest of the bankrupt chain, in 2011, when its regional parent company, RedGroup Retail, went into administration. The Borders space is now occupied by Topshop. The Jam Factory was also chosen by Brazin Limited to be the first site to reintroduce Virgin Megastores in Australia opening in 2002. It has since been closed by Sanity Entertainment (formally Brazin) in 2010 with the Virgin space now occupied by the country's first Urban by Target store. Before these major tenants closed their Jam Factory outlets, its owner, Challenger, announced in June 2008 a $700 million redevelopment that did not proceed. It would have seen the historic factory building demolished and replaced with a new style shopping centre (54,000 square metres of shops, more than double the present size), apartment towers built on the car park closest to Virgin Megastore/Urban by Target, 8000 square metres of office space, and a 100-room hotel. Challenger then attempted to sell the entire site in May 2009 for about $110 million without success. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Shopping centres in Melbourne Category:Manufacturing plants in Melbourne Category:Heritage-listed buildings in Melbourne Category:Shopping malls established in 1979 ","title":"The Jam Factory"},{"id":"1425285","text":"Olga Benário Prestes (February 12, 1908 - April 23, 1942) was a German communist militant gassed by Nazi Germany. ==Biography== Olga Benário Prestes during her imprisonment in Brazil in 1936.

He is perhaps best known for his Tafsir al-Mizan, a twenty-seven-volume work of tafsir (Quranic exegesis), which he produced between 1954 and 1972.Biography of Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei by Amid Algar, University of California, Berkeley, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies. He is commonly known as Allameh Tabataba'i and the Allameh Tabataba'i University in Tehran is named after him. ==Biography== He received his earlier education in his native Tabriz city, mastering the elements of Arabic and the religious sciences. and at about the age of twenty set out for the great Shiite university of Najaf to continue more advanced studies.Nasr, Seyyid Hossein in the preface to the book of Shiite in Islam by Allameh tabatabaei, 2005, p. 37 he studied at Najaf, under masters such as Ali Tabatabaei (in gnosis), Mirza Muhammad Husain Na'ini, Sheykh Muhammad Hossein Qaravi Esfahani (in Fiqh and Jurisprudence), Sayyid Abu'l-Qasim Khwansari (in Mathematics), as well as studying the standard texts of Avicenna's Shifa, the Asfar of Sadr al-Din Shirazi, and the Tamhid al-qawa'id of Ibn Turkah. Along with Sayyid Husayn Badkuba'i, he was a student of two of the most famous masters of the time, Sayyid Abu'l-Hasan Jilwah and Aqa 'Ali Mudarris Zunuzi. In his later years he would often hold study sessions with Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr, in which not only the classical texts of divine wisdom and gnosis were discussed, but also a whole cycle of what Nasr calls comparative gnosis, in which in each session the sacred texts of one of the major religions, containing mystical and gnostic teachings, such as the Upanishads, Tao Te Ching, the Gospel of John, were discussed and compared with Sufism and Islamic gnostic doctrines in general. Tabataba'i, was a philosopher, a prolific writer, and an inspiring teacher to his students who devoted much of his life to Islamic studies. Many of his students were among the ideological founders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely Morteza Motahhari, Muhammad Beheshti, and Mohammad Mofatteh. Others like Hossein Nasr and Hassan Hassanzadeh Amoli remained and continued their studies in the intellectual non-political sphere. ==Published works== In Najaf, Tabataba'i developed his major contributions in the fields of Tafsir (interpretation), philosophy, and history of the Shi'a faith. In philosophy the most important of his works is Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-e-realism (The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism), which has been published in five volumes with explanatory notes and the commentary of Morteza Motahhari. If Ayatollah Haeri is considered the reviver of Qom's hawza in an organizational sense, Tabataba'i's contributions to the field of tafsir, philosophy and mysticism represent the intellectual revitalization of the hawza with lasting implications for the curriculum. His other major philosophical work is a voluminous commentary of Asfār al-'arba'eh, the magnum opus of Mulla Sadra who was the last of the great Persian (Iranian) Muslim thinkers of the medieval age. Apart from these he also wrote extensively on philosophical topics. His humanist approach is underlined by his three books on: the nature of man - before the world, in this world, and after this world. His philosophy is focused upon the sociological treatment of human problems. His two other works, Bidāyat al-hikmah and Nihāyat al-hikmah, are considered among works of high order in Islamic philosophy. Several treatises on the doctrines and history of the Shi'a remain from him as well. One of these comprises his clarifications and expositions about Shi'a faith in reply to the questions posed by the famous French orientalist Henry Corbin. Another of his books on this topic Shi'ah dar Islam was translated into English by Seyyed Hossein Nasr under the title Shi'a Islam, with the help of William Chittick as a project of Colgate University. These books are claimed to serve as an excellent conduit by which popular misconceptions about the Shi'a faith may be removed further paving the way for a better ecumenical understanding amongst the various Muslim schools of thought. His written books number forty-four titles overall; three of which are collections of his articles on various aspects of Islam and the Qur'an. ===List of publications=== *Shi'a Islam () *The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism ( Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-i ri'alism) in five volumes, with the commentary of Murtada Mutahhari. * Glosses al- kifayah ().

Cigar box manipulation began as a vaudeville act in the United States between the 1880s and 1920s, and was popularized by W. C. Fields. Originally, performers would take actual boxes that cigars were stored in and nail them shut to create their juggling props. Today, cigar boxes for juggling are typically purpose-built, hollow wooden or plastic blocks with suede or foam rubber padding attached to the sides. ==Technique== Cigar boxes are juggled by holding a box in each hand and tossing and flipping a third box in between them. Routines performed with cigar boxes may also include quick midair box- exchanging tricks, balancing tricks, and more. Most tricks are done with three boxes; more advanced routines may include more than three. Rather than the \\"flowing\\" style of ball juggling, cigar boxes have what is often referred to as a \\"stop-and-start\\" style. In effect, this means that after the majority of tricks the boxes return to the home position (three or more boxes in a line, smallest ends together) and stop before the juggler starts the next trick. Most cigar box tricks are achieved by bouncing up and down (normally from the knees, keeping one's arms in the same place relative to one's body). The trick is started at the apex of the 'bounce' and the boxes are pinned in the home position on the downstroke, preferably at the same altitude at which they started. This leads to the visual effect of the boxes being connected by an invisible wire (in tricks where the boxes not involved in the trick are separate; see \\"take out\\" below) or it can appear as if the boxes are magnetic in some way (where two boxes remain 'stuck' together in the air; see \\"end round\\" below). This is just an illusion; the boxes are not in any way connected. ==Records== In 1977 Kris Kremo set a Guinness World Record of releasing one box and catching it after a quadruple pirouette.Veress Entertainment. \\"Kris Kremo\\". Retrieved 5 December 2012. In 1994, Kristian Kristof broke the record by releasing all three boxes and catching them after a quadruple pirouette. The world record for the most cigar boxes balanced is on the chin is 223 set by Ashrita Furman (USA) at The Culture Project Theatre, New York City, New York, USA, on 12 November 2006. == Construction == Whereas vaudeville performers originally tended to use actual cigar boxes, today, the props for cigar box routines are usually built specifically for manipulation. They may be constructed from various materials, including plastic, plywood, or even wall paneling.Steven Ragatz. \\"Cigar Boxes\\". Retrieved 5 December 2012.

Sindri was well known because of a large Fertilizer factory (Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited - FCI, closed in 2002) conceived here in the early industrialized India. It was also known for few other companies situated here such as ACC Limited (formerly Associated Cement Company Limited), Coal Mines of The Indian Iron and Steel Company Limited (IISCo), which has been taken over by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Projects and Development India Limited (PDIL), formerly Planning & Development Division of FCI and Coal Mines of the Bharat Coking Coal Limited, a subsidiary company of Coal India Limited. Another subject of topographical importance is the Damodar river which acted both as source of water and electricity for the township. A hydro-power project called Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is located at Maithon and Panchet near Sindri. DVC supplies eco-friendly electricity to some its neighbouring states like West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Sindri is also well known for the BIT Sindri which was earlier known as Bihar Institute of Technology later on its abbreviation changed to Birsa Institute of Technology when state is transformed from Bihar to Jharkhand. ==Origin of its name== As per the records of the now-closed fertilizer plant (FCIL), the name Sindri was the corrupt form of the word Sindoori (Vermilion). Also the meaning of sindri in Hindi is sundari. The name is said to be given by the local tribals because of the vermilion colored soil found here. Technically the type of soil available in the area is Laterite which has got a vermilion coloured or reddish hue. The word Sindri is also said to be a part of the Mundari lexicon. Mundari is a language spoken by the indigenous people who have lived in and around this place for a long time. It roughly translates into \\"Ridge\\" or \\"Frontier.\\" There are some evidences available that centuries ago the Santhals, Mundas and Hos inhabited the banks of the Sindhu River. They were later forced to move to Eastern part of the country by the Aryans. ==History== Sindri was a place with rich reserves of flora and fauna. The place was initially occupied by the local tribals which later on attracted people from neighbouring states. The chapter of its industrialization started when it was selected as best option for a fertilizer factory due to its apt geographical conditions in the year 1944 by the Viceroy's Executive Council following recommendations submitted in November 1944 by a three members technical mission consisting of G S Gowing and J Rigg, both of Imperial Chemical Industries and T H Riley of the Association of British Chemical Plants Manufacturers, Britain for setting up a single large fertilizer factory to produce 3,50,000 tons Ammonium Sulphate per annum with Gypsum as raw material. A separate project organisation was set by the Government of India in 1945 under the Chief Technical Advisor, Brig. M H Cox. To end the system of diarchy and to replace the same with one of autonomy, a company named Sindri Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited was formed under the Companies Act, which came into being in December 1951 as the first Public Sector Company, wholly owned and governed by the Government of India. The production of Ammonium Sulphate in the factory was started on 31 October 1951 and the factory inaugurated in March 1952. In his inauguration speech, the then Prime Minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru said that he was not just inaugurating a fertilizer factory but he was inaugurating a temple of modern India. The Company Sindri Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited was merged in January 1961 with another fertilizer manufacturing company Hindustan Chemical and Fertilizers Limited floated by the Government of India in July 1959 to form a bigger Company the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited. The factory was first in India to produce Ammonium Sulphate (1951), Urea (1959), Ammonium Nitrate-Sulphate, commonly called the Double salt (1959) and was the first fertilizer factory to have its own captive power plant in 1951 and to introduce planning, research and development facilities in 1951. The raw materials used initially for its final products were gypsum, coal and naptha. A number of new plants were added to the factory as need arose time to time. A rationalization scheme was completed in 1976 and a modernization project was commissioned in 1979 with product-mix of ammonia, urea, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate with low-sulphur heavy stock/furnace oil and coal as basic raw materials. In 1978, the Government of India decided to reorganise the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited and the National Fertilizer Corporation Limited, which was incorporated for fertilizer projects at Panipat and Bhatinda into five new companies. The Sindri fertilizer factory continued with the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited along with aged-old Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) Plant and three coal based fertilizer projects at Talcher (Orissa), Ramagundem (Andhra Pradesh) and Korba (Chhattisgarh) and newer plants and its Planning & Development Division were included in new companies, namely, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizer Limited (RCF), National Fertilizers Limited (NFL), Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFC) and Fertilizer (Planning & Development) India Limited (FPDIL), latter renamed as Projects and Development India Limited (PDIL). The Sindri fertilizer plant operated consistently in profit till 1967-68 and again in 1969-70. But in spite of modernisation, the factory could not maintain profit thereafter even after exceeding rated (attainable) capacity mainly because of unscientific division of the company, higher production cost and comparatively lower sale price of fertilizers, mounting wage bills, higher maintenance expenditure due to ageing of plants, availability of raw materials of low specifications/quality large infrastructure cost, and eventually the Government of India decided to close of the factory operation in September 2002. Though the fertilizer plant was, of late, not an eventual commercial success but it certainly provided a wonderful social environment for many generations of people during its existence. The Bihar Institute of Technology now renamed as Birsa Institute of Technology was also established to meet the growing demand of technology experts in this new industrialized area. The institute still remains as one of the premier institutions for technical education in the state of Bihar and Jharkhand. == Geography == ===Location=== Sindri is located at . It has an average elevation of 178 metres (583) feet Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. The earlier notified area was combined with other urban units to form Dhanbad Municipal Corporation in 2006. Sindri is spread over parts of Ward No. 52, 53 and 54 of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation. ===The region=== The region shown in the map is a part of the undulating uplands bustling with coalmines. The Damodar River, the most important river of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, flows along the southern border. A major part of the area shown in the map is part of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation, an urban area. The places in the DMC area are marked as neighbourhoods. The western part of the region shown in the map is covered by Dhanbad (community development block). 57% of the population of Dhanbad CD block reside in rural areas and 43% reside in urban areas, The east-central part of the region shown in the map is covered by Baliapur (community development block). 86% of the population of Baliapur CD block reside in rural areas and 14% reside in urban areas. The places in the CD block areas are marked mostly as census towns. Three operational areas of BCCL operate fully within the region – Pootkee Balihari Area, Lodna Area and Eastern Jharia Area. The Moonidih sector of Western Jharia Area also operates in the region. ===Police station=== There is a police station at Sindri. ==Connectivity== Sindri is well connected by road and rail to the district headquarters of Dhanbad and is very close to the Bokaro Steel City just . The road between Sindri and Dhanbad has usually been in a state of disarray due to the regular movements of lorries loaded with fertilizer, cement, coal and sand. There is a local train available between the place and the district headquarters many times a day. There are three small railway stations/halts in the 27 kilometre long broad gauge line between Sindri Town and Dhanbad Junction namely - Sindri Marshalling Yard, Sindri (Block Hut), Rakhitpur, Pradhan Khanta and Dokra Block Halt. Visitors wanting to reach the township should not confuse between Sindri (Block Hut) and Sindri Town railway station. The rail line connects Sindri (via Dhanbad) to the all important cities of India which includes Kolkata, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Jabalpur, Patna, Ranchi, Bokaro, Gwalior, Nagpur, Pune Jammu, Ahmedabad and regional industrial city of Jamshedpur with the most important train through Sindri being the Subarnarekha Express. Kolkata (), Ranchi () and Patna () provide air connectivity to Sindri which connects it to Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Pune, Nagpur, Pune, Indore and Hyderabad. ==Technical institute== Founded in 1949, BIT Sindri is a technical institution offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses in ten branches of engineering and technology, approved by All India Council of Technical Education, New Delhi. The Institute has campus spread in nearly 450 Acres, spared by the FCIL Sindri, and operates under the aegis of Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of Jharkhand, Ranchi. BIT Sindri and was formerly known as Bihar Institute of Technology, Sindri which was renamed as Birsa Institute of Technology (BIT), Sindri after the creation of Jharkhand state in November 2000. The Institute is affiliated with Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh. It is the only one government aided institute in Jharkhand. ==Localities== The township of Sindri can be divided into three different areas. The first part was the residential area for the employees of FCIL and PDIL, the second part was occupied by the employees of ACC. The third part was occupied by the students and staff of Bihar Institute of Technology, in short BIT Sindri. The division of the town in terms of localities can be done as - Domgarh, Rohrabandh, Saharpura, Manohartand, Gaushala and Rangamati. Domgarh was the older tribal village of Sindri, or better associated as the residence of Doms. Other localities like Rohrabandh, Domgarh, Shaharpura and Rangamati were all housing colonies for the employees of FCIL and PDIL. Gausala was the area just outside the campus of BIT Sindri. The Sindri township was well-planned township with over lush green avenues all over with all possible amenities and spacious Quarters with lawns in front and space for kitchen garden in the backyard, trees like gulmohor, Kadam, Nim, Chhatim flanked the well maintained streets. A green town with enviable landscape in the seventies had 4- Dispensaries and a main Hospital with 206 beds, Kalyan Kendra - The Sports club, Officer's club - A club for FCI executives, Rabindra Bhawan - a place for cultural conglomeration. Houses were laid out neatly in the form of layouts with ample open spaces for garden lovers. Uninterrupted Power supply was made available to the township locally produced in FCI Power Plants. Damodar river was the source of water for the entire township. A highly sophisticated water purification system was designed to supply water in the township. If Sindri was a temple of Modern India, its altar was the immaculately landscaped design and well staffed Hospital and other amenity centers. There was a park called 7 Lakes. As the name suggests, the park had seven lakes neatly bordered with lush green bushes and trees. It was a huge park with children play area and few small animals in enclosure such as deer, rabbits, parrots, peacocks. On the new year day, every year the residents would occupy different parts of the park to have a picnic with friends and family. The reminiscence of the park can still be found but it is not as maintained as it used to be in the past. After closure of the FCIL factory, the electricity and water supply from its Water purification plant has been limited. ==Social life== The fertilizer plant brought together people from many different locations of India to work in various roles. Sindri was truly the mixing pot for various cultures and regions in India. It was not unusual to find a Bengali, a Bihari, a Sikh, a Tamil, a Kannada and a Jain family living in the same block of the town. The communal harmony and social acceptance which was instilled in youngsters growing up in the town made it much easier for them to adapt to a diverse culture. The greatest contribution of Sindri Fertilizer Plant may be in creating a generation of Indians born with multi-cultural values. Such multi-cultured adaptive people are now spread all over the world. Shaharpura hosted the downtown shopping area where established dry goods merchants, tailors and butchers shared their space with farmers and other small-time merchants. Every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday a lively open air market was held featuring fresh locally raised produce, poultry and locally crafted artefacts. Wandering minstrels and traditional medicine men from as far away as Afghanistan brought with them unexpected services and concoctions like low cost street side tooth extraction and \\"lizard oil\\" for arthritis sufferers that was brewed in-situ at low heat in wide mouthed vats of oil in which a few exotic looking lizards lounged around (unharmed) for the afternoon. Marathon bicyclists occasionally came to town to ride around in circles for days on end without setting their foot down. This form of theatre elevated everyday activities like shaving, showering and eating to heroic levels and got the salaried men of Sindri to spare some change for their more venturesome if less fortunate compatriots. The open air market was Sindri's window to the rest of India and brought a splash of colour to an otherwise pastel town. Sindri was also known for its active socially conscious Ladies Club and Vanita Samaj, two prominent organizations for the wives of the officers in Sindri. Literature in different languages thrived in Sindri with organizations like Hindi Sahitya Parishad, Vidyapati Parishad, Urdu-Hindi Sangam and Anjuman-i-Urdu. Various Mushaira's (Urdu Poetry) and Kavi samelans were held in between 1965 and 1995. From a literature perspective, this was the glorious era of Sindri due to people who worked actively for conducting literary activities in the town, specially in the field of Hindi literature. Theatre, Drama and Music had a significant role in the social lives and the Bengali community played a significant part in this. This part of Sindri life was heavily influenced by Calcutta (now Kolkata, just 250 km away). Ajanta Kala Mandir was a significant part of the children growing up in Sindri. Children learnt Kathak dance and Hindustani Classical music. In its days of glory, this institution had won many awards for Sindri. The Kalyan Kendra (Welfare Centre) located between Rohrabandh and Shaharpura had a sprawling ground adjacent to it. The complex boasted of a traditional gym and a modern one too. Later a swimming pool was built as part of this complex. It was the venue for Independence Day and Republic Day parades and location of choice for staging plays and poetry readings by groups that believed that watching movies (along with chewing tobacco, imbibing tea, gambling and playing chess or cards,) was a bad habit. The one western influence that seeped into Kalyan Kendra was table tennis and of course carrom board. The Bengali literati staged night long yatras and durga pujas, the Bihari Literati (and those from Eastern UP) staged Kavi Samelans and observed Chaat, the Tamil literati arranged for Kacheris and staged Ayyappan Puja. == Educational institutes == In order to provide educational services to children of its employees and wards of other residents of Sindri and nearby localities, the FCIL Management started the first school in Sindri in 1948. The management of the fertilizer factory ran seven Rajendra schools, - three high Schools affiliated to the Jharkhand Academic Council, four middle schools following curricula under the Jharkhand State Education Policy in Shaharpura and Domgarh areas of the Township, all named after Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of the independent India and one English medium integrated senior secondary school, Model English High School, affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi in Rohrabandh area of the Township. Rajendra High School for girls in Saharpura area were imparting education exclusively to girl students. In addition to the FCIL managed schools, the FCIL Management established various private schools viz. * De Nobili School (CISCE affiliated Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations chain of schools run by Society of Jesuits ), * Lions Public School (affiliated to the CBSE Central Board of Secondary Education), * DAV Public School (managed by the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic College Trust and Management Society, New Delhi) * Saraswati Shishu Vidya Mandir (managed by the Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan, New Delhi), which also provide excellent education to residents. There are numerous preparatory schools as well, leading among which was Ravindra Parishad. To provide for higher education to its workers and their wards FCIl Sindri Unit established a co-educational degree college named Sindri College with science, humanities and commerce streams. Sindri College is presently a constituent unit of the State run Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh. == Current status == Sindri fertilizer along with Gorakhpur, Ramagundam, Talchar and Korba of the FCI were referred to Board of Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) after being declared sick in 1992. However, when the Government of India failed in submitting any revival proposal for the closed fertilizer units, the BIFR recommended for their closure. The Government of India on 5 September 2002 decided to close down all loss-making fertilizer units of FCI and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation and lay off all the employees. The employees of Sindri fertilizer factory units were made to retire under Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) and the plants were closed in December 2002. The BIFR then referred the case of closed fertilizer units to Delhi High Court for appointing liquidators for selling the assets of the closed units and clearing the dues of different debtors. Meanwhile, the GAIL planned to lay Natural Gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal which would be laid at around 20-25 kilometres from the factory area. Coal Bed Methane (CBM) exploration in the vicinity and factory location amidst coal mines has further added the interest for revival activity of the Sindri fertilizer factory. In 2004, the Government of India appealed the Delhi High Court to stop the process of liquidation as it intended to revive the closed fertilizer units of the FCI. Later, the Delhi High Court referred back the matter of closed units of FCI to the BIFR for considering revival of the Sindri fertilizer factory along with other closed down units of FCI at Ramagundam, Talcher, Gorakhpur and Korba. The Government of India in April 2007 decided in principle to revive the closed Sindri fertilizer factory subject to availability of Natural Gas as input. In 2010, the Government of India has decided to revive the Sindri fertilizer complex with SAIL as strategic partner and setting up a 5.6 MT Steel Plant, 1.15 MT Urea Plant and a 1000 MW Power Plant was contemplated. The SAIL launched special purpose vehicle for the purpose and got the name of the new project registered as SAIL Sindri Projects Limited(SSPL). The BIFR on 27 June 2013 approved revival of the Sindri Fertilizer Plant along with other closed down units of the Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCI). The BIFR clearance has paved the way for setting up of the industrial complex at a Sindri. Approved DRS envisaged revival of Sindri unit by SAIL at estimated project cost of Rs. 35,000 Crores. However, not much progress was made due to non-availability of around 3000 Acres of contiguous piece of land for the Steel Plant due to encroachments. In the meantime, the due change in its modernization and expansion plan SAIL has taken a view not to pursue the Sindri Revival project further. The Government of India has approved in May 2015 to revive the closed Sindri Fertilizer Plant through 'bidding route' with investment of Rs. 6,000 Crores. Accordingly, Bids have been invited from the interested investors, which is due to open in December 2015 == Demographics == India census, Sindri had a population of 76,827. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Sindri has an average literacy rate of 68%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy rate is 77%, and female literacy rate is 57%. In Sindri, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. == References == 2\\\\.

He resides in Washington, D.C. ==Biography== Silverstein worked for the Los Angeles Times as an investigative reporter, for The Associated Press in Brazil, and has written for Mother Jones, Washington Monthly, The Nation, Slate, and Salon. He is a self-described \\"vole\\" in the newspaper business, and an opponent of what he considers \\"false 'balance'\\" in the news media. In 1993, Silverstein started CounterPunch, a political newsletter. Silverstein left this publication in 1996. Silverstein previously wrote a regular column for Harper’s Magazine, called Washington Babylon. His last column was in September 2010. Silverstein was also Washington editor for Harper's. He drew attention in 2007 for a report in which he went undercover as part of an investment group with business interests in Turkmenistan, raising questions about journalistic ethics. Silverstein said that he could not have exposed the willingness of the companies to work with a Stalinist dictatorship using conventional journalism methods. In December 2013, Silverstein was hired as senior investigative reporter by First Look Media. In November 2014, Silverstein began writing for First Look's The Intercept. There, Silverstein sparked some controversy for an article critical of the popular NPR podcast, Serial. In February 2015, Silverstein announced his resignation from The Intercept in a series of Facebook posts calling his former employers a \\"pathetic joke\\". Expressing anger and disillusionment towards the company, Silverstein stated, \\"I am one of many employees who was hired under what were essentially false pretenses; we were told we would be given all the financial and other support we needed to do independent, important journalism, but instead found ourselves blocked at every step of the way by management's incompetence and bad faith.\\" Silverstein launched the website Washington Babylon in 2016, for which he is editor-in-chief. The site is named after his previous column at Harper's and the 1996 book he co-wrote with journalist Alexander Cockburn. Silverstein said his goal for Washington Babylon is \\"to cover DC politicians and journalists like Hollywood celebrities – not the way they are worshiped by our current media masters.\\" ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * Washington Babylon, Verso Books, 1996 (co- authored with Alexander Cockburn) * Private Warriors, Verso Books, 2000 * Washington on $10 Million A Day: How Lobbyists Plunder the Nation, Common Courage Press, 2002 * The Radioactive Boy Scout: The True Story of a Boy and His Backyard Nuclear Reactor, Random House, 2004 * Turkmeniscam: How Washington Lobbyists Fought to Flack for a Stalinist Dictatorship, Random House, 2008 * The Secret World of Oil, Verso, 2014 ==References== ==External links== * Washington Babylon, Ken Silverstein's website * Washington Babylon, Ken Silverstein's former blog at Harper's Magazine * * Ken Silverstein: Arizona is Laboratory for Radical GOP Policies - video report by Democracy Now!, democracynow.org; July 15, 2010.
