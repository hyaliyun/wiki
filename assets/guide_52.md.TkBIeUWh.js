From his given name and place of birth, it can be presumed that he was partially descended from the English Catholic settlers of Maryland who later helped to settle Western Kentucky. He then attended the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. While there he determined to become a priest, and was accepted by his home Diocese of Louisville. He enrolled in Saint Bernard's Seminary in Rochester, New York, to do his theological studies, graduating in 1904, when he was ordained by the Bishop of Louisville, William George McCloskey. ==Mission San Juan Capistrano== Within months of his ordination, O'Sullivan was diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis, and advised that his prognosis was poor. He decided to seek a drier climate in order to cope better with the disease and, with his bishop's permission, moved to the American Southwest. He helped in various parishes in Texas and Arizona. In this way, he came to know the Rev. Alfred Quetu, the Catholic pastor of Prescott, Arizona. The pastor suggested that O'Sullivan might find the abandoned Mission San Juan Capistrano in California might provide him a place for him to exercise his ministry in a manner compatible with his health. O'Sullivan traveled to the Mission, where he fell in love with the site. O'Sullivan was put in charge of the ruined Mission on July 5, 1910, making him the first priest to be resident at the mission since 1886. He set up a tent in the ruins of the mission, where he lived and began to minister to the local community. With a vision of how the Mission had looked in its heyday, he led restoration efforts at the Mission while he recovered. Working with his own hands, he began the restoration of the church, carving new beams and plastering and repairing the old walls. As the Mission began to regain its former glory, the priest found that his health was improving. ==Honours and legacy== In 1918 the Mission was given parochial status by the Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles, John Joseph Cantwell, with O'Sullivan named as its first pastor in modern times. He was later named a Supernumerary Privy Chamberlain by the Holy See, entitled to be addressed as \\"Monsignor\\". O'Sullivan wrote Little Chapters About San Juan Capistrano in 1912, and in 1930 co-authored Capistrano Nights: Tales of a California Mission Town with Charles Francis Saunders and Charles Percy Austin. O'Sullivan died in Orange, California, in 1933 and was buried in Calvary Cemetery in the East Los Angeles neighborhood of the city. On November 7, 1934, his remains were re-interred in the cemetery of the old Mission, adjacent to the Serra Chapel which he had helped to rebuild, where they rest today.Hallan-Gibson, p. 83 The O'Neill Museum was created at the Mission and serves headquarters of the San Juan Capistrano Historical Society and the repository of all its archives. ==See also== * Zephyrin Engelhardt * Maynard Geiger * Junípero Serra ==References== ==External links== * \\"Little Chapters about San Juan Capistrano\\" by Father St. John O'Sullivan, 1912 Category:1874 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Religious leaders from Louisville, Kentucky Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:Saint Bernard's Seminary alumni Category:20th-century American Roman Catholic priests Category:Priests of the Spanish missions in California Category:History of Orange County, California Category:Burials at Calvary Cemetery (Los Angeles) Category:Burials at Spanish missions in California Category:American Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in the United States Category:Catholics from Kentucky ","title":"St. John O'Sullivan"},{"id":"9078789","text":"The posterior surface of the tibia presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the soleal line (popliteal line in older texts), which extends obliquely downward from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds.

In 1860, Williams analyzed rubber by destructive distillation and obtained a large quantity of a light oil which he termed isoprene (polymer of the monomer isoprene—formula CH2:C(CH3)CH:CH2). Many efforts were made during the next 70 years to synthesize rubber in the laboratory by using isoprene as the monomer, but these did not bear fruit until Samuel Horne succeeded in 1955. In 1868, he established the Brentford dyestuff works Williams, Thomas and Dower in New York City.

It sits on a small plateau of and a southern down slope of the North Downs and its ecclesiastical parish borders continue to span old boundaries and reach into Chipstead, Coulsdon and Wallington. ==History== The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon hundred of Wallington which served for strategic meetings of elders and manor owners in the various kingdoms, including in the two centuries before the Norman Conquest, the Kingdom of England. Woodmansterne appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Odemerestor, derived from Old English \\"Ode\\" = (W)ode = Wood, \\"mere\\" = pond, and \\"tor\\" = high ground.The Diocese of Southwark, Reigate Deanery It was held by Richard de Tonebrige. Its Domesday assets were: 15 hides; 1 church, 1 mill worth 20s, 5 ploughs, of meadow, wood worth 10 hogs. It rendered £8 per year to its overlords.Surrey Domesday Book The traditional parish borders are very long and narrow and reach into Chipstead, Coulsdon and Wallington, based on the borders of Greater London as they have stood since 1965 and the loose and informal widening of Chipstead that has occurred since its railway station and approximately 400m on all sides is within these boundaries.St Peter's Church Church of England parish browser ==LandmarksSt Peter's Church=== The parish church is a Victorian replacement of an older building and due to its late Victorian date and not being by an architect of national renown (as at 2013) it is not listed. It was built in 1877 having been built to a tall and steeply hipped-gable roof design by Mr J. Clarke. ===Weston Acres=== This westerly home within a smallholding is listed including its garden terrace wall, in the initial class (of Grade II). Built as a large house it later became accommodation for Seafarers UK (at the time: the Seafarer's Society). Mostly built in 1906, the north entrance front was added in 1915, designed by architect Sydney Tatchell. The design was exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1916 and was published in several building magazines of the period. ==Geography== A residential linear settlement on two main roads, with a few side estates, Woodmansterne is green-buffered in every direction bar two compass points by woods, allotments, and two small farms. The two contiguous settlements it adjoins are in the south, Chipstead, and in the east, a suburban part of the town of Coulsdon. The buffer zones are Metropolitan Green Belt. The area of the primary school, recreation ground and Carshalton Road is on a significant-to-the village northern plateau at 140m above sea level and the remainder of the village is a long, gentle down slope to the south, which contains a majority of the homes. This slope is a middle part of the Chipstead Bottom Valley which descends to only 85m Above Ordnance Datum draining as a dry valley to the north-east. The large gentle slope is half of the major crevice into the widest part of the North Downs which the north of the borough spans. Geologically revealing the sea creatures hidden in the chalk and limestone range, south is the 8 km-long, narrow due-south slope of the North Downs by the M25 motorway, at Betchworth Quarries and Box Hill scaling 80m to 120m from top to bottom, in less than 250m. ==Demography== The United Kingdom Census 2011 recorded three settlements as a ward, as Woodmansterne is not large enough in population to merit a ward of its own. As the parish has no equivalent civil parish for extra tiers of local government, being part of an unparished district for those purposes save for Salfords and Sidlow, its population can be produced from the related combined boundaries of output areas Reigate and Banstead 004A and 004B, as an approximation. This altogether had a population of 2,979, living in 1,117 households. ==Local government== The ward returning three councillors to the borough council is named after the three villages it covers: Chipstead, Hooley and Woodmansterne. At the Surrey County Council authority, which is responsible for roads, subsidised public transport, surface water drainage of public roads, most social care and services not to the elderly, libraries, subsidised adult education, overall waste disposal and minerals extraction, state colleges and certain, one councillor is returned per electoral area, here serving the division Banstead, Woodmansterne and Chipstead.Surrey County Council – Find Member Retrieved 2013-20-10 ==Transport== ;Road Just beyond Woodmansterne upper part border to the north, in the Oaks area of the Wallington is on the A2022, a chord-like route within the M25 from Epsom to the London Boroughs of Croydon and Bromley. The centre of the village is on the B278, (from Morden via Carshalton to Chipstead Bottom). A local easterly route, Woodmansterne Lane, connects the middle of the above main, long, north-south route through the village to Banstead, adjoining to the west. ;Rail The railway station on the London to Tattenham Corner Line \\"Woodmansterne\\" is served by Chipstead Valley Road, Coulsdon less than 200m beyond the border of the London Borough of Croydon and is in the Oyster Zone system. A local unlit footpath links the village to the station via The Mount on Clockhouse over a field from Manor Hill/Rectory Lane. Along this footpath you can clearly see the radio and tv transmitters at Reigate and Colley Hill. ;Bus Transport for London bus route 166, from West Croydon to Banstead (and hourly journeys extended to Epsom) threads through Woodmansterne via a circuitous but partly long-established route. Approaching from Coulsdon along Chipstead Valley Road, it eschews the most direct approach along Rectory Lane, and continues along the valley to turn later into Chipstead Road, thus serving a more populous area. Two steep climbs either side of a descent bring the bus to the centre of Woodmansterne village. Here again, the bus adopts a long detour of more recent origin, this time to the north, via the thinly populated Carshalton Road, Croydon Lane and Sutton Lane, to reach Banstead village, in preference to the more direct route via Woodmansterne Lane. It was diverted from the direct route in 2003, when the service frequency was increased to three per hour, owing to the narrowness of Woodmansterne Lane,Surrey County Council report Retrieved 30 December 2013 after a short period when only the hourly service extended to Epsom continued to operate via Woodmansterne Lane. The 166 follows a route (with the exception of the detour to the north) which was formerly operated by Epsom Buses as route 598, and before that by Banstead Coaches as a shuttle between the Mid- day Sun public house in Chipstead (connecting with the 166, which at that time terminated there) and Banstead village.London Bus Routes Retrieved 30 December 2013 ==Notes and references== ;Notes ;References ==External links== Category:Villages in Surrey Category:Reigate and Banstead ","title":"Woodmansterne"},{"id":"9078818","text":"The Assignment is a 1997 spy action thriller film directed by Christian Duguay and starring Aidan Quinn (in two roles), with Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The film, written by Dan Gordon and Sabi H. Shabtai, is set mostly in the late 1980s and deals with a CIA plan to use Quinn's character to masquerade as the Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. ==Plot== Carlos the Jackal has sex and kills a spider in its web with his cigarette then evicts the woman from his room. He dons a disguise and walks to a cafe where CIA agent Henry Fields (Donald Sutherland) is sitting at a table. He recognizes Fields and asks for a light but Fields does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise. He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of people. The next year, the Jackal attacks an OPEC meeting to earn a ransom. The CIA sends Fields to identify Carlos, but he secretly plans to assassinate him with a concealed pistol. The plan is foiled when his CIA superior stops him from reaching out to shake Carlos' hand because he might be photographed doing so by nearby journalists. In 1986 Carlos is apparently apprehended in an open-air market in Jerusalem and brutally interrogated by a Mossad commander named Amos (Ben Kingsley). The man claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest. Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos. Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Fields (now using the name Jack Shaw) who tries to recruit him to impersonate the terrorist leader. Ramirez refuses the assignment. Shaw persists, turning up at a Navy ball and trying various manipulations to goad Ramirez into taking the assignment. He finally succeeds by confronting Ramirez with the human cost of Carlos' terrorism by taking him to Bethesda Naval Hospital to see a boy who has been crippled by one of Carlos' bombs. Amos and Shaw train Ramirez at a former prison in Canada. Much of his training is devoted to situational awareness and internalizing details of Carlos' life. His training concludes with Carla, one of Carlos' ex-mistresses, training Ramirez in how to make love like Carlos. The plan revolves around convincing the KGB, which is financing his terrorism, that Carlos has begun selling information to the CIA. Shaw lures one of Carlos' ex-lovers, Agnieska, to Libya, where Ramirez convinces her of his legitimacy. He notices she has become an informant for French intelligence, however. Several French agents arrive at their apartment, and Ramirez is forced to kill them to his own horror. Carlos sends an assassin to kill Agnieska in France, ordering him to leave Europe through London. The assassin happens to be in Heathrow airport at the same time as Ramirez, and he quickly realizes he is an impostor after Ramirez fails to recognize a code phrase. During a struggle, Amos and the assassin kill each other. After Amos' death, the CIA suspends the operation and Ramirez returns home. Ramirez makes love to his wife as Carlos would, and she is disturbed by his change. The next day, at his son's little league game, he gets into a confrontation with another father and nearly kills him. Shaw bails him out of jail, and both men are clearly suffering from the failure of their mission. Ramirez accuses Shaw of fabricating the scene at the hospital to trick him into accepting the assignment and Shaw threatens to use the Ramirez family as bait to lure out Carlos if he tries to back out. That night Ramirez painfully reveals the mission to his wife but leaves to continue it, knowing that his family will never be safe as long as Carlos is alive. Ramirez and Shaw meet up in East Berlin and the KGB photographs them, assuming Carlos has been turned. Enraged, the KGB raids Carlos' safe house, but he escapes. Shaw and Ramirez are waiting outside for him, and Ramirez fights Carlos on the bank of the Spree River. It is impossible to tell which of the two is the real Carlos during the struggle. As one of the men is being held under water by the other, Shaw comes upon them and shoots the man above the water several times. He realizes too late that he has shot Ramirez, and Carlos swims away. Ramirez presses Shaw to leave him and kill Carlos, but Shaw insists that their plan has worked and that Carlos is a target of the KGB. Back home, a car bomb kills Ramirez and his family and Shaw attends the funeral. In St. Martin, Carlos receives a news clipping of the bombing with a congratulatory note from Shaw, implying that he staged the killing to liberate the Ramirez family. Ramirez nearly kills a spider in its web like Carlos, but does not.

It was formed in 1967 and is located in Ishiwara, Sumida, Tokyo. As of January 2020 it had 22 sumo wrestlers, five of whom were of sekitori rank. It is the most successful stable in terms of total yūshō won by its wrestlers, with 52. ==History== Former yokozuna Chiyonoyama of Dewanoumi stable had wanted to succeed to the Dewanoumi name, but the then Dewanoumi stablemaster (former wrestler Dewanohana) had already decided to pass the name to former yokozuna Sadanoyama. Accordingly, in January 1967, he set up his own stable, taking with him, amongst others, then ōzeki Kitanofuji and attaching the new stable to the Takasago group of stables. After Chiyonoyama died in 1977, Kitanofuji, who had already revived Izutsu stable, became the 11th Kokonoe-oyakata. He raised Chiyonofuji, then a makuuchi wrestler, to the great yokozuna he became. Later he also saw Hokutoumi become a yokozuna. Takanofuji and Fujinoshin also reached the top division. In 1992, the year after Chiyonofuji retired from the ring, Kitanofuji handed over the stable to him. Chiyonofuji and Kitanofuji swapped names, Chiyonofuji becoming Kokonoe-oyakata and gaining control of the stable, whilst Kitanofuji became Jinmaku-oyakata, attached to Hakkaku stable, set up by the former Hokutoumi in 1993. In the early 1990s Kokonoe stable was one of the largest in sumo but had only one sekitori, Tomoefuji. Kokonoe eventually produced Chiyotenzan, briefly a komusubi in 1999, and long serving ōzeki Chiyotaikai (1999–2009), his most successful wrestler. Following the retirements of Chiyotaikai in January 2010 and Chiyohakuhō in April 2011, the stable had no sekitori for a short time, but Chiyonokuni reached jūryō in July 2011 and the top division in January 2012. Chiyotairyū followed afterwards and reached makuuchi in May 2012. By March 2014, Kokonoe stable was one of the most successful stables in sumo, with three men (Chiyotairyū, Chiyoōtori and Chiyomaru) in the top division and two (Chiyonokuni and Chiyono-ō) in jūryō. In January 2016 the stable moved up to six sekitori with the promotion of Chiyoshōma, the most of any stable.

Cinema Retro magazine. The film was shown as an NBC World Premiere Movie in 1974.Ford 2011, p. 164. ==Plot== U.S. Air Force Colonel Pete Moore (Glenn Ford) is the commander of the Whitney Air Force Base 458th Radar Test Group, which has been experiencing electrical difficulties aboard its aircraft. To find the problem, he sends a four-man crew on Flight 412, with Captain Bishop (David Soul) as commander. Lt Podryski (Greg Mullavey), Capt Riggs (Robert F. Lyons), and Lt Ferguson (Stanley Bennett Clay) are Bishop's crew. Shortly into the test, the Grumman Gulfstream II jet, a small twin- engine VIP transport, picks up three blips on radar. Subsequently, two fighters scramble to investigate and mysteriously disappear. At this point, Flight 412 is forced to land by an unnamed top-level military intelligence group that debunks UFO sightings (referred to throughout the film by their facility's radio call sign \\"Digger Control\\", though this is never implied to be the organization's actual name), diverted to a remote, abandoned military airfield somewhere in the desert in the American Southwest. The crew is taken to a barracks building to undergo an 18-hour debriefing by members of a military Special Investigation Division (SID) team, which is more like an indoctrination to convince them that they did not see a UFO. Meanwhile, their aircraft is stored in a dilapidated hangar to hide it from search-and-rescue aircraft. To all appearances, Flight 412 has simply vanished into thin air. Colonel Moore, with the help of Major Mike Dunning (Bradford Dillman), sets out to find out what has happened to his crew. Just as the government interrogation begins to raise doubts among the flight crew about the \\"flying saucer\\" sighting, Moore and Dunning find the secret base. Their efforts to release the crew are stymied by SID leader, Lieutenant Colonel Trottman (Guy Stockwell), who cites national security concerns. Bishop attempts to escape, but Trottman threatens to make things rough on his crew, who agree to accept a sanitized version of their report. After their release, when Dunning and Podryski choose to accept the report, the others: Moore, Bishop, Ferguson, and Riggs seek the help of General Enright (Kent Smith). Trottman appears and makes the case to the General that nothing untoward has happened. When a similar incident later occurs, the same process is employed; those who cooperate get promoted, while the others find that their careers suffer. ==Cast== As appearing in The Disappearance of Flight 412, (main roles and screen credits identified):\\"Credits: The Disappearance of Flight 412 (1974).\\"Turner Classic Movies.

The film starts out with stock black- and-white clips of UFOs in flight and various individuals reporting sightings in newsreel style, with narrator voice-overs, to set the mood. However, the remainder of the film (in color) deals only briefly with the fictitious UFO encounter by the aircrew, focusing instead on their ordeal as they undergo an arduous debriefing and brainwashing at the hands of their somewhat mysterious captors. It uses on-screen time stamp titles to lend the feeling of a documentary, similar to the 1971 film The Andromeda Strain. ==Reception== After its broadcast premiere, The Disappearance of Flight 412 was destined for late-night TV and lately, home media release. Later reviews have relegated the film to an also-ran due to its \\"cheesy\\" production values with a reliance on stock footage. ==ReferencesNotes=Citations=Bibliography=== * Ford, Peter.

Then in 1994, it became KPLA and has consistently been a Top 3 radio station in the market, playing \\"soft rock.\\" KPLA broadcasts from the highest tower in Columbia, Missouri, reaching within Mid-Missouri. ==History== Al Germond was responsible for engineering and applying for the 101.7 frequency for KARO-FM under the company name of Columbia FM. In 1992, Al Germond and his business partners, John Ott and David Baugher, bought KFRU-AM under the company name of Columbia AM. Later came additional radio stations, including KBXR-FM 102.3, KOQL-FM 106.1, KJMO-FM, KLIK-AM, KBBM-FM and KZJF-FM, as well as ownership of the Columbia Business Times publishing products. By February 2004, the company had become Premier Marketing Group and sold the radio stations to Cumulus Broadcasting for $38.75 million.Columbia Daily Tribune Cumulus Broadcasting assumed operation on March 1, 2004. ==Programming== Playing soft rock music from the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2K, KPLA remains one of the top-three radio stations in Columbia after 25 years on-the- air. Notable weekday programming on the station includes \\"Good Mornings\\", hosted by Emily Larkin and Ross Murdoch. Each weekday from 6:00 AM until 10:00 AM, Emily and Ross share relateable experiences of their own life and provide the latest news. The show was formerly called \\"Chris and Monica in the Morning\\", since it was co-hosted by Chris Kellogg and Monica Senecal. On June 27, 2013, it was announced that Senecal would be retiring from radio and that her last show would be July 5. Emily Larkin replaced her position, after which the show was referred to as \\"Chris and Emily\\". Kellogg left the show three years later in July 2016, leaving Larkin to host the show solo until Murdoch started in December of that year. Other weekday programming includes Rachel Marisay from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM; \\"Afternoons with Tim Thomas\\" from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM; and syndicated host John Tesh from 7:00 PM to Midnight.

Weekend programming includes John Tesh episodes on Saturday mornings starting at 6:00 AM and going until 9:00 AM. Saturday afternoons and evenings are dedicated music-only timeframes. \\"Your Weekend with Jim Brickman\\" airs Sunday Mornings from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The station computer treats this as a music-only timeframe—Brickman's own playlist airs during this time. At 7:00 PM, John Tesh airs, starting the cycle over again. ==Alumni== Sarah Hunter was part of the KPLA dating back to 1987 and the \\"K102\\" days of the radio station. She was co-host on the morning show with a variety of male counterparts, including J. R. Greely, Rob Carson, Tom Bradley and Kevin Hilley. Sarah retired from radio in May 2005.

NCD Broadcasting was the original company that started KOQL-FM under a local marketing agreement with KPLA's parent company. KOQL-FM was later bought by KPLA's parent company and in 2002, Kellogg was moved to middays on KPLA. Tom Bradley's career in Columbia started with KTGR-AM when the radio station was broadcasting country music. After leaving the area in the 1980s, Tom returned to Columbia to launch KCLR-FM.

Her father was Patrick Lynch (died 1819), of Dublin, Ireland, who took part in the United Irishmen Rebellion of 1798. For this, he was imprisoned and then banished from Ireland. He came to the United States at the age of 18, eventually making his way to Bennington where he set up a dry-goods business, and where he met his future wife, Charlotte Gray (1789-1873), daughter of Revolutionary War veteran Lt. Col. Ebenezer Gray (1743-1795). Patrick Lynch and Charlotte Gray married in 1812. Along with their daughter Anne, they had a son, Thomas Rawson Lynch (1813-1845). Lynch's father died in 1819, shipwrecked off the coast of Puerto Principe, in the West Indies. After the death of her father, the family moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where Anne and her brother were sent to the best schools. When she was sixteen she was sent to the Albany Female Academy, where she graduated with high honors in 1834 and stayed there as a teacher for a few years. ===Literary society=== She moved to Providence, Rhode Island with her mother in 1838, where she continued to teach. In 1841, she compiled and edited \\"The Rhode Island Book\\", a collection of poems and verse from the best regional writers of the time, including two poems of her own. She also began to invite these writers to her home for her evening receptions. It was said in 1843, that \\"the very best literary society of Providence could be found in the parlor of Miss Lynch\\". In 1845, Lynch met the famed actress Fanny Kemble, who became very attached to her and introduced her to a wider circle of literary friends\\". In the same year she moved to Manhattan with her mother. She began teaching English composition at the Brooklyn Academy for Young Ladies; she continued her writing and was published in periodicals such as the New-York Mirror, The Gift, the Diadem, Home Journal, and the Democratic Review. In New York, she also continued her literary receptions which she held every Saturday evening. It was at one of these receptions that she introduced the unknown Edgar Allan Poe to the literary society of New York. In 1848, her book \\"Poems\\" by Anne C. Lynch, was published by George P. Putnam. Edgar Allan Poe said of her: \\"She is chivalric, self-sacrificing, equal to any fate, capable even of martyrdom, in whatever should seem to her a holy cause. She has a hobby, and this is, the idea of duty.\\" Anne Lynch lived in Washington DC from 1850 to 1853, while serving as the personal secretary to Senator Henry Clay.See Kim Roberts, A Literary Guide to Washington, DC: Walking in the Footsteps of American Writers from Francis Scott Key to Zora Neale Hurston, University of Virginia Press, 2018, p. 23. ===Marriage=== Vincenzo Botta, circa 1860 Lynch traveled to Europe in 1853, where she met Vincenzo Botta, an Italian professor of philosophy in Turin. They married in 1855. Mrs. Botta told an intimate friend of her marriage, \\"it satisfied her judgement, pleased her fancy, and, above all, filled her heart\\". ===Evening receptions=== For many years she was a well-known and popular leader in society. She hosted intellectual gatherings, seemly without the least bit of effort or pretension, at her home on West 37th Street. Unlike other salons, which had more to do with seeing and being seen by the high society of New York, her receptions provided a creative space in which artists could meet and collaborate. It was said of her salons that no one was either neglected or treated like a celebrity, and every one went away feeling stimulated, refreshed, and happy. At Mrs. Botta's receptions every Saturday night, attendees would find the most well-known writers, actors and artists, such as Poe, Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Louisa May Alcott, Harriet Reisen, Louisa May Alcott: The woman behind 'Little Women', New York: Henry Holt and Co., 2009, p. 253, reports Bronson Alcott frequented their salon in 1856, Louisa Alcott frequented it during her stay in New York the winter of 1875/76, and describes the topics as \\"politics and literature in three or four languages.\\" Horace Greeley, Richard Henry Stoddard, Andrew Carnegie, Mary Mapes Dodge, Julia Ward Howe, Charles Butler, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Delia Bacon, Grace Greenwood, Bayard Taylor, William Cullen Bryant, Helen Hunt Jackson, actress Fanny Kemble, Daniel Webster, and many more. Her friend Kate Sanborn started her literary lecturing career at these receptions. Said a Boston writer: \\"It was not so much what Mrs. Botta did for literature with her own pen, as what she helped others to do, that will make her name a part of the literary history of the country.\\" ==Later life== In 1860, Mrs. Botta published the Handbook of Universal Literature, which contained concise accounts of authors and their work. She wrote: \\"This work was begun many years ago, as a literary exercise, to meet the personal requirements of the writer.\\" This book was used as a text book in many educational institutions. She was also a sculptor of portrait busts. Her sculpture of Charles Butler, done in marble, was donated to New York University. She said: \\"Beauty in art, in my opinion, does not consist in simply copying nature, but in retaining the true features of the subject, and breathing on them a breath of spiritual life, which should bring them up to their ideal form.\\" An example of her poetry which showed her interest in literature: ::IN THE LIBRARY ::Speak low, tread softly through these halls; ::Here genius lives enshrined, ::Here reign, in silent majesty, ::The monarchs of the mind. ::A mighty spirit-host they come ::From every age and clime; ::Above the buried wrecks of years ::They breast the tide of Time. ::And In their presence-chamber here ::They hold their regal state, ::And round them throng a noble train, ::The gifted and the great. Anne Charlotte Botta died of pneumonia at age 75. She is buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in New York. Mrs. Botta refused to write an autobiography, so after her death, her husband collected correspondence, poems, and biographical information and had a book published, in 1893, called the Memoirs of Anne C. L. Botta: Written by Her Friends. A quote by her friend, Mrs. L Runkle: \\"Life was the material with which she wrought.\\" One of her noteworthy legacies is a quinquennial prize of $1,000 she founded at the Académie Française for the best essay on \\"The Condition of Woman.\\" She also promoted the establishment of Barnard College. ==References* *Works of Anne C.

Webpage archived at WebCite from this original URL on 2008-03-06. A fateful job working behind the scenes at a movie sound stage led her towards working in the film industry. Dorn appeared in two films as an actress (including a nude \\"Archbishop\\" in the 1976 satire TunnelVision) before moving behind the camera. She worked her way up the food chain (working as a production assistant, script supervisor, assistant location manager, and several other freelance jobs) eventually attaining the position of assistant film editor which she held until 1982. Finding it unusually difficult to move up to picture editing, Dorn made a lateral move to sound editing. Her work as a sound editor on James Cameron's The Abyss (1989) won the Golden Reel Award and was nominated for a best sound Academy Award. In 1986, she started her own sound company, Sonic Kitchen, but with time, got more and more disenchanted and distracted with the daily business grind. Dorn had begun to lose interest and was compelled to get back to her passion—feature film picture editing. It was the editing of the unusual documentary cult film SICK: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist and Memento which brought Dody Dorn's picture editing to the attention of the rest of the world. She has since continued to work with director Christopher Nolan on several films and has repeatedly worked with noted film director, Ridley Scott. In addition to her credited editing on Scott's films, Dorn worked on the 2003 DVD releases of Alien (the \\"Director's Cut\\").Hunt, Bill and Dugan, Todd (2003). The Digital Bits Insider's Guide to DVD (McGraw-Hill Professional), p. 118. Dorn was selected for membership in the American Cinema Editors.\\"American Cinema Editors > Members\\", webpage archived by WebCite from this original URL on 2008-03-04. ==Quotes== *\\"It is still a commonly accepted notion that the editor just \\"cuts out all the bad bits.\\" I liken editing more to sculpture. I don’t claim to be Michelangelo, but I like to think that when I am watching the dailies projected for the first time, I am seeing the pure essence of the film and that I work toward preserving and presenting that essence in a form that is accessible while still being artful.\\" *\\"There is also a lot of trial and error in the editing room. Even if a director has a clear vision of what he wants, until the images are actually juxtaposed and the rhythm is defined by the editing, you never really know how it will work.\\" *\\"I appreciate invisible editing, but it’s fun when editing can be conspicuous, provided it is adding to the narrative and not done for its own sake.\\" *\\"Editing is making choices. During post- production, I work with the director to mine the best film out of the material that was shot. Leaving no stone unturned and going with my gut instincts, two seemingly diametrically opposed concepts, are techniques that I put to use on every film. That strange combination of hard work and divine inspiration probably means, inevitably, that I have left my stamp on the films I’ve edited.\\" *\\"I see a finished film as a total product and I cannot separate (nor do I want to) the various aspects of the film. The images work in conjunction with the sound and the music and they need to be considered together, in just the same way that the rhythm and juxtaposition of the images need to be considered. I do use my experience in sound all the time. I work with temp sound and music in the AVID from day one. I may sometimes edit without sound for technical reasons, but putting sound in follows very close behind and will definitely affect how I evaluate what I have edited and will often stimulate changes.\\" ==Selected filmography As Film Editor=== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Six leather-bound volumes from a complete set of Dobson's Encyclopedia. This set has written in it that it was owned by Moses Moon, a Quaker who lived at the time of the Revolutionary war, noted for having harbored an anti-war protester. Dobson's Encyclopædia was the first encyclopedia issued in the newly independent United States of America, published by Thomas Dobson from 1789–1798. Encyclopædia was the full title of the work, with Dobson's name at the bottom of the title page (see illustration). The encyclopedia was a reprint of the contemporary third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (published 1788–1797), although Dobson's Encyclopædia was a somewhat longer work in which a few articles were edited for a patriotic American audience. The term Britannica was dropped from the title, the dedication to King George III was replaced with a dedication to the readers, and sundry facts about American history, geography and peoples were added. Reproduction of printed pages was not then possible; the entire work was re-set in type, allowing changes to be made throughout. However, the work is largely a reprint of Britannica. The plates were re-engraved from the originals as accurately as possible, but some were changed. For example, the map of North America used in Britannica's third edition was the very out-of- date one used in the first and second editions; Dobson's used a larger and much more detailed and updated map, and a slightly improved map of South America. ==History== The 18-volume third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica was published between 1788 (Volume 1) and 1797 (Volume 18) in Scotland, and was well received. It was by far the best edition of the Britannica to date. (See History of the Encyclopædia Britannica for more details.) A two-volume supplement was added in 1801. In this era, enterprising American printers were matching their British counterparts in quality and quantity, and severely undercutting them in price. A successful master printer, Dobson objected to a British bias he perceived in the Britannica, and resolved to re-edit the Britannica accordingly. He completed his Encyclopædia in April 1798, a year after the original. It had 16,650 pages, with 595 engraved copperplates, slightly more than the Britannica. In support of Dobson's patriotic initiative, President George Washington subscribed to two sets, one of which now is kept with most of the rest of George Washington's personal library in the Boston Athenæum. Its retail price was five Pennsylvania dollars per volume, about 15% less than the price of Britannica in America, subject to import tax on British books.Sher, Richard B. The Enlightenment & the book: Scottish authors & their publishers Purchasers included George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton. The original printing of 2,000 copies had sold out by 1818, at which time he still had a quantity of the 3-volume supplement remaining. To sell it, he had new title pages for the 3 volumes printed up dated 1818, and called them the Encyclopedia.Arner, Robert D. (1991). Dobson's Encyclopaedia: The Publisher, Text, and Publication of America's First Britannica, 1789-1803. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Page 180. By the time of Dobson's death in 1823 the Encyclopædia was outdated, and was eventually superseded by the first edition of Encyclopedia Americana (1829-1833). ==Subscription sales== Dobson did not approve of door-to-door sales, which had been used by his contemporary Parson Weems to sell William Guthrie's New System of Modern Geography and Oliver Goldsmith's History of the earth and Animated Nature. The door-to-door approach also seemed impractical, given the Encyclopædia's price and the long printing time of nine years. Instead, Dobson conducted an all-out advertising blitz, unlike any before seen in North America, to secure subscriptions; his advertisements appeared in newspapers, on magazine wrappers, in spare book leaves, and in pamphlets distributed to all the major book-sellers of his day. Dobson also appealed strongly to the patriotic pride of the newly independent Americans; he used only American materials and craftspeople and his announcement of the first \\"American\\" encyclopedia was timed to match George Washington's selection as the first President under the new Constitution. His first advertisements appeared on 31 March 1789 in three newspapers: the Pennsylvania Mercury, the Pennsylvania Packet, and the Federal Gazette. ==Printing== Like the Britannica, Dobson's Encyclopædia was published in weekly numbers, which could be then bound into volumes or half-volume parts. The price of each number was \\"one quarter of a dollar\\". The first weekly number was published on 2 January 1790, followed the next week by the second number. Dobson continued his regular printings until a fire destroyed his business and stock on an early Sunday morning, 8 September 1793; the heat of the fire was sufficient to melt much of his metal print parts. Dobson was again printing his Encyclopædia within a month. ==Editorial difficulties== Dobson encountered some editorial difficulties, most notably on the essay concerning Quakers in Volume 15, which roused some indignation in Philadelphia, the home of many Quakers. Dobson had merely reprinted an offensive article from the Britannica which had been written by George Gleig (later Bishop of Brechin), without checking it for accuracy. A devout Anglican, Gleig showed bias against George Fox, the founder of the Quakers. Dobson met this challenge by meeting with the Quakers and printing a rebuttal essay in defense of George Fox's character. The Quakers' approaches to race relations and other social issues were often noted as enlightened and praised throughout the Encyclopædia. ==Comparison with the Britannica's third edition== Most of Dobson's Encyclopædia is a copy of the third edition of the Britannica. The chief exceptions can be found in the articles dealing with American geography, most notably Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, and American history, such as the surrender of the British in the American Revolution. A very detailed account of that war, in both Britannica and Dobson's, makes up roughly the second half of the article \\"America\\" in Vol 1. In Britannica, it goes from page 574 to 618, in Dobson's from 575 to 626, making Dobson's account seven pages longer. Volume 1 of Dobson's is re-paginated back to 619 after the article, to once again line up with Britannica. In addition to Dobson himself, Jedidiah Morse, the father of American geography, made significant contributions; for example, he defended the status of women among the Native American peoples, which had been called \\"slavish\\" by the Britannica's editors, most likely James Tytler: Morse also disputed the view of the Britannica that the skins and skulls of Indians were \\"thicker than the skins and skulls of many other nations of mankind\\". It is likely that there were other contributors to Dobson's Encyclopædia, but their names are unknown. ==The Supplement== Dobson began thinking about his supplement even before the Encyclopedia was finished. He began work on it before Britannica advertised their intention of producing a supplement, and when the British supplement started to be printed, Dobson had a good amount of additional material to include with it. His supplement, dated 1803, was 3 volumes long, compared with the two-volume supplement published by the Britannica in 1801. The Supplement was more independent and more accurate than the main encyclopedia had been, but sales were relatively poor. One notable article is \\"Pneumatics\\", which correctly defends Count Rumford's conclusion that water is a relatively poor conductor of heat, which had been criticized by an important Britannica contributor, Dr. Thomas Thomson of Edinburgh. The differences between the texts of Encyclopædia Britannica and Dobson's Encyclopaedia are mostly found in the supplement. The 1803 two-volume second edition of Britannica's supplement had 1,622 pages; Dobson's three-volume supplement had 2,004, and 53 plates against the Britannica's 50. Almost all the added pages in Dobson's supplement involved American interests, such as expanded descriptions of the states, of New York City and Boston, with hundreds of added cities and locations, descriptions of Indian tribes and their locations and customs, great expansion of American political leaders, an expanded article on the first president, and an entirely new four-page article for Benjamin Franklin.Encyclopædia Britannica 1803 supplement and Dobson's 1803 supplement. There was an article on Franklin in the 3rd edition of Britannica, and he was mentioned many times in various other articles, but no article in its supplement. The Britannica had a four-page article on Washington; Dobson's supplement repeats it and adds four more pages. Dobson's supplement had a 30-page article on \\"The United States of America\\" not in the Britannica's supplement. The Supplement was printed by Budd and Bartram of Philadelphia. ==Competition== Dobson's Encyclopædia encountered significant competition from his rival printer, Thomas Bradford of Philadelphia, who proposed in 1805 to reprint Abraham Rees' New Cyclopaedia with American amendments. The 44-volume British original first began to appear in London in January 1803, but was not completed until 1820; the 47-volume American reprint was not completed until 1822. Not only did the project drive Bradford bankrupt, it also drove his successor bankrupt, the firm of Murray, Draper, Fairman and Company. Dobson was vulnerable to competition due to two factors: his encyclopedia was beginning to be outdated, and it had relatively few biographies of Americans. Dobson and his son Judah eventually went out of business in 1822; Dobson died on 9 March 1823. A New York City competitor was Low's Encyclopaedia which was printed between 1805 and 1811. It was a more compact work, containing only seven volumes of 650 pages each (Dobson's 18 volumes were 800 pages). It was aimed at a market for more general circulation, being one-fourth the price and more portable, whereas Dobson's was aimed at the wealthy class. Low's was not a reprint of an earlier British work, but was mostly of American authorship, and all the plates and maps were engraved by Low from original sources. Low's Encyclopedia appears to have gone out of business after a single edition, as John Low died in 1809 and his widow Esther Prentiss Low, who took over and completed the work, died in 1816. A very compact four-volume encyclopedia, the Minor Encyclopedia of 1803, was an American revision of Kendal's Pocket Encyclopedia, and was so small it did not compete with the former two works. A more successful encyclopedia following Dobson's was the 13-volume Encyclopedia Americana, published 1829-1833 by Francis Lieber. The Encyclopedia Americana was based on Brockhaus' Conversations-Lexikon, with significant added material. ==See also== * Thomas Dobson * Lists of encyclopedias * History of the Encyclopædia Britannica ==References== Notes Bibliography * Well- researched with exhaustive citations to primary sources, this is the authoritative source on all matters pertaining to Dobson's Encyclopædia. ==External links== * Category:English-language encyclopedias Category:American encyclopedias Category:Editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica ","title":"Dobson's Encyclopædia"},{"id":"9079050","text":"Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary is the main hospital in Dumfries, Scotland. The hospital is managed by NHS Dumfries and Galloway. ==History== The old hospital at Nithbank The old hospital at Bankend Road The hospital has its origins in a small facility at Mill Hole in Burns Street in central Dumfries which opened as the Dumfries Infirmary in 1776. The hospital moved to High Dock in 1778 before becoming the Dumfries and Galloway Infirmary in 1785 and the Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary in 1807. Dr William Scott administered sulphuric ether, in the first use of anesthetics in the United Kingdom, at the High Dock facility in 1846. The High Dock facility has since been demolished. The hospital relocated to a new building at Nithbank which was designed by John Starforth, completed in 1873 and was extended in 1897. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. The old Nithbank facility was subsequently used to accommodate the offices of NHS Dumfries and Galloway. The hospital moved again this time to a facility at Bankend Road, which was designed by Boswell, Mitchell & Johnston and opened by the Queen in 1975. A cancer care centre was opened by Princess Alexandra in 2003. The old Bankend Road facility continues to be used as the Mountainhall Treatment Centre. In 2012 it was announced that a new 350-bed hospital would be built on the A75 close to the Garroch roundabout. It was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in March 2015. The hospital was designed by Ryder Architecture and NBBJ and built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of £213 million. The new hospital was officially opened by the Princess Royal in July 2018. ==Services== The hospital serves the town of Dumfries and the catchment area of South West Scotland with a population of c.150,000. It is made up entirely of single rooms, 344 of them, each with a computer point to allow real-time updating of patient records.

It is named for the comic book character Superman, and the related genes kryptonite (gene) and clark kent were named accordingly (although the latter turns out to just be another form of superman). It encodes a transcription factor (specifically a C2H2 type zinc finger protein). Homologous genes are known in the petunia and snapdragon,Box 3: The control of floral determinacy in Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis from which are also involved in flower development, although in both cases there are important differences from the functioning in Arabidopsis. Superman is expressed early on in flower development, in the stamen whorl adjacent to the carpel whorl. It interacts with the other genes of the ABC model of flower development in a variety of ways. == Gene function == Superman encodes a transcription factor. This protein binds to the DNA through a zinc finger binding motif acts as a regulator of floral homeotic genes, controlling the development of the flowers of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Arabidopsis thaliana flowers develop in four whorls, which are concentric groups of cells branching off of the growing meristem. Superman has been found to act in the fourth whorl of flowers, which would normally develop into Carpels. Superman normally restricts the effect of another gene called (APETALA3) in the fourth whorl, leaving APETALA3 expression only present in the second and third whorls. APETALA3 is a gene normally associated with the development of a stamen in the third whorl, so by its restriction, we allow for the development of other organs in the fourth whorl (such as the Pistil). A mutation which completely removes superman gene function would result in flowers that carry extra stamens, replacing the pistils which would normally be developing in the fourth whorl. This mutation was named the sup-1 mutation. For the sup-1 mutation, More extreme stamen development is seen from a homozygous mutation than a heterozygous mutation. === Interaction with the ABC model of flower development === The gene which Superman interacts with (APETALA3) is a member of the B-Function group of the ABC model of flower development, which is typically responsible for the development of Stamen and Petals. Other important members of the ABC model of flower development include APETALA1, APETALA2, AGAMOUS, and PISTILATA. Superman has not been found to interact with any of these other genes. SUPERMAN (SUP) and SUPERMAN-like genes such as APETALA2 work as a protein complex regulators with other corepressors known as TOPLESS (TPL) and a Histone Deacetylase 19 (HD19) in order to repress transcriptional functions in plants Krogan, N. T., Hogan, K., & Long, J. A. (2012). APETALA2 negatively regulates multiple floral organ identity genes in Arabidopsis by recruiting the co-repressor TOPLESS and the histone deacetylase HDA19. Development, dev-085407.. == Epigenetic changes to Superman == Superman has been found to undergo to epigenetic modifications. Specifically, cytosine methylation (attachment of methyl radicals to cytosine bases), which represses its transcriptional activity. This methylation brings about the Clark Kent (clk) epialleles, which are a set of altered versions of the Superman gene lacking function. Whereas most cases of cytosine methylation in plants tend to happen in the Promoter of transcription, the cytosine methylation of Superman happens within the gene, just after the promoter. The exact location of the methylation varies, but defines which clk epiallele we define the plant as having; so far there are 7 identified clk epialleles (numbered clk1-clk7). These Clark Kent alleles can be inherited, but often, through mutation will revert to the natural gene at a rate of about 3% per generation == References == Category:Arabidopsis thaliana genes Category:Flowers Category:Superman ","title":"Superman (gene)"},{"id":"9079140","text":"Llanfair Clydogau is a small village and community encompassing , located about north-east of Lampeter on the B4343 road, in Ceredigion, Wales.

They instantly fall in love, but Kerstin is ruled by very strict relatives, so they must hide their love story from everyone, not the least from the extremely strict vicar.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Armstrong School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 Armstrong School District has adopted a set of standards which limits foods to be served in schools. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. Armstrong School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health’s extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. HEALTHY Armstrong is a collaborative group made up of ACMH Hospital, Armstrong School District, Children’s Community Pediatrics-Armstrong, UPMC Health Plan and numerous other community partners all working together to increase wellness opportunities for Armstrong County families and youth. ==School safety and bullying== The Armstrong School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying at Kittanning Junior High School in 2012. There were no incidents involving local police. However, one bomb threat and one weapon (a knife) at the school were reported. Each year, the school safety data is mandated to be reported by the district to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Armstrong School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. By state law, Pennsylvania public schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and the board is required to review its policy every three years. Additionally, Armstrong School District is mandated to conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. ==Tuition== Students who live in the Armstrong School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rates at Kittanning Junior High Schools was $11,468.59. ==Cyber Education== Students who reside in the Kittanning Junior High School attendance area may enroll in Armstrong School District's Cyber Academy.

The district provides the student with the necessary computer equipment at no cost to the parents. ==Extracurriculars== The Armstrong School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and a costly, extensive sports program. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. ;Junior High School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Football *Soccer *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Tennis *Volleyball According to PIAA directory July 2013 ==References== ==External links== *District Website *Kittanning Junior High School website Category:Public middle schools in Pennsylvania Category:Kittanning, Pennsylvania Category:Educational institutions established in 1910 Category:Schools in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania Category:1910 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Kittanning Junior High School"},{"id":"9079196","text":"Shale is a web application framework maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.

It plays a variety of current hits along with some hit music from the past, as far back as the 1980s. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station's studios are located in South Tampa and the transmitter site is in Riverview. WMTX also serves as the primary Emergency Alert System station for all of Tampa Bay. ==Station history== In 1947, the station signed on the air as WDAE-FM, a contemporary music station (though it would carry the WATL call letters for a two-year period). In 1976, the station flipped to beautiful music and the callsign changed to WAVV. During the WAVV years, the station's tagline was \\"Waves of Beautiful Music\\". In 1978, the callsign changed to WJYW. In 1982, the station flipped from beautiful music to adult contemporary and the callsign changed to WIQI (\\"W-101\\"). In 1986, the callsign changed to WUSA-FM (named after Washington D.C. TV station WUSA-TV), while still being named \\"W-101\\" before rebranding as simply \\"101 WUSA\\" in July 1994.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-07-01.pdf \\"See ya, W-101, your number's up - sort of\\", St. Petersburg Times (July 1, 1994) - dead link In December 1996, after Gannett traded the station to Jacor, the station flipped to hot adult contemporary and rebranded as \\"Kiss 100.7\\", with the call letters changing to WUKS.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-13.pdf; In 1998, the call letters were changed to WAKS. During the \\"Kiss\\" era, the station was the home of the popular, locally syndicated Mason Dixon Morning Show. On August 28, 1999, at Midnight, the station became \\"Mix 100.7\\", and the callsign changed to WMTX (which was first used on 95.7 as \\"Mix 96\\"). Community outrage was highly noted in local newspapers and on other radio stations.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-09-03.pdf Under the \\"Mix\\" branding, the station went to a mainstream adult contemporary format. The station initially carried Casey's Top 20 countdown, hosted by Casey Kasem, and Backtrax USA. The format would later shift to adult top 40. In 2019, for the first time in the history of \\"Mix\\", the station flipped to Christmas music for the holiday season, a week before WDUV or WJIS/WCIE usually flip to Christmas music.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/181953/wmtx-makes-first-time- christmas-move/ In 2020, WMTX shifted to adult contemporary. ==Signal== WMTX transmits from a tower in Riverview, Florida, shared with six other FM radio stations, and nearly all of the TV stations serving Tampa Bay. WMTX's signal is powered at 100,000 watts at 1,549 ft height above average terrain. With a good radio, the station can be heard in the Orlando and Cape Coral areas. ==WMTX-HD2== Former logo of WMTX-HD2 In early 2007, WMTX launched an HD2 subcarrier with a Soft AC format. On December 17, 2007, WMTX's HD-2 dropped the Soft AC format to introduce an LGBT-oriented HD radio station called Pride Radio. It played Dance and Rhythmic Hits. On January 28, 2013, WMTX-HD2 changed their format to classic rock, branded as \\"Thunder Tampa Bay\\", and began to be relayed on FM translators W233AV 94.5 (Gulfport) and W290BJ 105.9 (West Tampa).Thunder Returns to Tampa Bay Radioinsight - January 28, 2013 On September 24, 2014, WMTX-HD2 started simulcasting on W256CT 99.1 (Bayonet Point). In the Fall of 2015, WMTX-HD2 began simulcasting on translator W275AZ 102.9 (Wesley Chapel South). The \\"Thunder\\" branding and format was previously used on sister station WTBT 105.5/103.5 (now WFUS) from 1995 to 2005.

It stands between Eskdale and the Duddon valley in the Southern Fells. ==Topography== The headwaters of Eskdale and the Duddon are separated by a ridge falling south west from the summit of Crinkle Crags. This line of high ground continues over many twists and turns for 15 miles, finally meeting the sea on the slopes of Black Combe. From Crinkle Crags the first fells on this ridge are Hard Knott, Harter Fell and Green Crag. Alfred Wainwright considered the remainder of the range unworthy of inclusion in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, stating that \\"south and west from Green Crag the scenery quickly deteriorates. This summit has therefore been taken as the boundary of fellwalking country.\\" Later guidebook writers have disagreed, adding Great Worm Crag, Yoadcastle, Whitfell, Buck Barrow, Black Combe and the low hills around Devoke Water to their hill lists.Richards, Mark: Southern Fells: Collins (2003): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Wainwright himself later relented and included these lesser hills in a supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. Green Crag as seen from Harter Fell, the true summit is just left of centre. Green Crag is the highest of a series of rocky tops which stand out from the Birker Fell moorland. Running from north to south these outcrops present a fine serrated skyline when viewed from Eskdale. Birker Fell itself is roughly square and about two miles across, with Eskdale to the north and the River Duddon to the south. Above the wooded valley of Eskdale there is a skirt of crags before the open moor is reached. Over this edge tumble the waterfalls of Stanley Force and Birker Force, the former easily reached by made paths from the road. The farmers of Eskdale once extracted peat from the plateau and the remains of graded paths and peat huts can still be found on the fellside. On this flank the remains of Gate Gill iron mine can also be found. Haematite was won from a number of levels here in the 1880s.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) The Duddon flanks have shallower gradients, divided by dry stone walls into long strips of pasture land. This rough grazing supports a series of farms along the valley between Ulpha and Seathwaite. To the east of Green Crag is a marshy depression before the ground rises again to Harter Fell. The western boundary is formed by the Birker Fell Road, an unenclosed route from Ulpha to Eskdale Green with fine views of the Scafells. Summiting at 885 ft with hairpin climbs at either end, the road is frequently closed in winter by snow and ice. Beyond the road the moorland climbs via Seat How to the summit of Yoadcastle. From here it turns south, forming a more definite ridge on the long march to Black Combe. The high point of the fell lies on a line of tors which break through the peat and fellgrass toward the east of the plateau. Travelling south from the Eskdale rim the tops are Kepple Crag, Great Whinscale, Crook Crag (1,538 ft), Green Crag and White How. The crest then turns west toward the Fell Road, passing over Great Worm Crag (1,400 ft), considered by some to be a separate fell. To the west of the summit ridge is Low Birker Pool, a tarn which feeds Birker Force. This shallow waterbody is contained by a low moraine and overlooked by Tarn Crag.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): ==Geology== The summit knoll is formed by plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) ==Summit== The summit of Green Crag is composed of naked rock and the ordinary walker will only find access from the north or west, mild scrambling being required.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: The view from the small cairn on the summit gives a fine prospect of the southern fells, together with a sight of the sea due south. ==Ascents== Green Crag can be climbed from the Birker Fell Road, where there are some suitable off-road spaces for parking. From Eskdale the best access is via the sled gate (i.e. path used for dragging peat on sleds) which climbs near Birker Force. The plateau can also be reached in the vicinity of Kepple Crag. From the Duddon there are waymarked paths through the conifer plantations, beginning at the various Forestry car-parks. ==References== Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"Green Crag"},{"id":"9079423","text":"Rigs of Rods (RoR) is a free and open source vehicle-simulation game which uses soft-body physics to simulate the motion destruction and deformation of vehicles. The game uses a soft-body physics engine to simulates a network of interconnected nodes (forming the chassis and the wheels) and gives the ability to simulate deformable objects. With this engine, vehicles and their loads flex and deform as stresses are applied. Crashing into walls or terrain can permanently deform a vehicle until it is reset; however, not all vehicles in the game have flexible bodies. == Simulation == Beam showing the beams on a DAF Ampliroll DAF TurboTwin in Rigs of Rods Rigs of Rods was initially created as an off-road truck simulator, but has developed into a versatile physics sandbox game. Prior to version 0.28, the game was limited to typical land vehicles with wheels, but plane and boat engines have been added since. All engines allow for a wide range of customization, leaving virtually no boundaries. Vehicles are built using vertices connected by beams. Vertices (or \\"nodes\\") are influenced by the stress on the beams that connect them. If a beam is too stressed, it will deform, thus altering the associated nodes position which ultimately alters the appearance and handling of a vehicle. Vehicle configurations are stored in plain text. Simple 2D skins can be made to wrap the vehicle, and can be supplemented with static mesh objects. Recent development has allowed for static meshes to be deformed according to a skeleton of nodes, much like the system in the game 1nsane. This system is known as Flexbody, and has been included since version .36. The mapping system uses terrain data defined in a raw image file, such as that found in a digital elevation model which can be used to form a realistic surface. Terrains can be made using any other program that can generate a black and white raw image format. This also means that maps can be made from any image. As a sandbox, Rigs of Rods has no fundamental gameplay goal, but scripting support contributes to missions and game play interaction like the timing of checkpoints along a road or dragstrips. Previously, Lua was supported as the scripting engine, but it has now been replaced by AngelScriptreplaced by AngelScript since version 0.38. Multiplayer support allows over 64 users to simultaneously interact on a playing field. == Critical reception == Physicist Brian Beckman described Rigs of Rods as \\"one of the best driving simulations I have ever seen.\\"http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=314874 Rigs of Rods was featured in PC Gamer UK in the Christmas 2007 edition. French magazine MicroSim previewed Rigs of Rods in their June 2008 issue. Rigs of Rods author, Pierre-Michel Ricordel, was invited to talk about the game at the French convention, Libre Software Meeting on July 10, 2009. == Commercial Adaptation == In 2011, some Rigs of Rods developers gathered to create a new commercial product called BeamNG.drive using the basics from what they had learned making Rigs of Rods.ign.com: The Most Impressive Physics Engine You’ve Never Seen, retrieved January 12, 2020 ==See also== * List of open source games == References == == External links == * * (Outdated, moved to GitHub) * Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Racing video games Category:Windows games Category:Open-source video games Category:Software that uses wxWidgets Category:Video games developed in France ","title":"Rigs of Rods"},{"id":"9079425","text":"The FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held 12–25 February in Spain at Sierra Nevada near Granada city.

He then proposed to construct a system of cryptographic protocols, in which a bank or the government would be unable to trace personal payments conducted online.Chaum, David. \\"Security Without Identification: Transaction Systems To Make Big Brother Obsolete\\". Communications of the ACM 28.10 (1985): 1030-1044. Web. This technology became fully implemented in 1990, through Chaum's company, DigiCash. ===Technology=== DigiCash was a form of early electronic payment, which required user software to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This advancement of public and private key cryptography allows electronic payments to become untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or a third party. This system of Blind Signatures through DigiCash software improved security for its users through the issuance of secured keys, which prevented third parties from accessing personal information through online transactions. The Mark Twain Bank, later acquired by Mercantile bank, located in Missouri was the only U.S. bank that supported DigiCash systems. Deutsche Bank, based in Germany, was the second backing bank of DigiCash systems.https://www.chaum.com/ecash/articles/1996/05-07-96%20-%20DigiCash_s%20Ecash™%20to%20be%20Issued%20by%20Deutsche%20Bank.pdf ===Bankruptcy=== DigiCash was unable to grow the company successfully through the expansion of its user base. Chaum stated in an interview in 1999 that the DigiCash project, and its technology system, entered the market before e-commerce was fully integrated within the Internet.Brodesser, Jens-Ingo. \\"First Monday Interviews: David Chaum.\\" First Monday [Online], 4.7 (1999): n. pag.

Contrary to their number associations, the series progressed backwards; hence, the supposed Startling Odyssey III: Miriam no Seisen, would've been the first chronologically, followed by Startling Odyssey II: Maryu Sensou, and then Startling Odyssey I: Blue Evolution. ==Startling Odyssey II== ==Main charactersRobin Solford=== The 20-year- old knight captain of the Hyneld kingdom. He has a very stalwart sense of duty and his reputation greatly precedes him. He's known by many as the ”青い死神” or \\"Blue Death God\\". He is the strongest of the knights of the Hyneld kingdom and his skill with a sword is legendary. Unfortunately, he is extremely thick in the head when it comes to relationships and women in general, making this a main source of comedy in the game. ===Julia Melrose=== An 18-year-old highly accomplished magician with few peers and an extremely talented doctor. She nurses Robin back to health after he falls from a bridge on the summit of a mountain pass. She eventually travels with Robin and falls deeply in love with him. She is extremely conscious about the enormous size of her breasts and this is also a major source of comedy in the game. ===Vivian Caram=== A 17-year-old tough tomboyish nun who is highly gifted in the art of kenpō. She single-handedly clobbers a large group of bandits out of a wrongful accusation and is well known for her signature move \\"Vivian Bomber\\" which she uses repeatedly (and to comedic effect) throughout the game. A comic relief in the game, Vivian tends to say some caustic things and has a predilection towards ingenuous suggestions and fulminations towards several NPCs in the game. ===Galious Ruding=== A 27-year-old bandit leader and ex-special agent, Galious was hand-picked and trained as a ninja alongside his best friend and superior, Bullet Thunder. Fast, powerful, and dangerous, Galious is capable of easily fending off multiple attacks from Vivian single-handedly. A scandalous pervert and womanizer, Galious's tendencies as a peeping tom (and his contingent tendency to force Robin to join him) are a source of high level adult-humor in the game. Despite his perverted shortcomings, he has an extremely strong sense of loyalty and would risk his life to save his friends. ==Plot== The events of Startling Odyssey II begin with the mad scientist Dr. Killbait attempting to resurrect one of the 8 \\"Demon Dragons\\" in an underground laboratory in the Hyneld Continent. Dr. Killbait ultimately succeeds; however, the dragon escapes, destroying the laboratory in the process as well as destroying half of a town. Elsewhere, the protagonist of the game, Knight Captain Robin Solford, and his two cohorts, Balmor Roatlette, and Harold Norman, are patrolling the Feidan Forest as a result of the recent reports of a chimera threatening the area. Robin quickly senses the presence of the chimera and the three are subsequently attacked by the enormous beast. Balmor and Harold draw their blades and attack it, but only to be thwarted by the chimera's massive natural armor, their swords shattering into pieces in the process. As Balmor comments how it's invulnerable to their weapons, Robin proceeds to attack the chimera and fells it in one swing, slicing the great beast in two, much to the chagrin of Balmor and Harold. Returning to Hyneld Castle, Robin meets with King Hyneld and is informed of the strange happenings in the neighboring town south of the Hyneld Kingdom (which so happens to be the same town from which the dragon escaped). Robin then sees his adoptive sister, Patricia Hyneld, who professes her concern over his journeys. Promptly he reassures her he will be alright and quickly leaves with Balmor and Harold. As Robin and his friends investigate the underground laboratory they find an odd magical amulet which Harold attempts to read, but can't since the characters are too difficult. Presently, Hyneld Castle is attacked by the same dragon that had escaped. Having never anticipated the attack of a dragon, the castle's guards are no match for the terrific onslaught and many are slain. In an effort to avoid capture, several guards escape with Princess Patricia Hyneld via an underground passage. As Robin, Balmor, and Harold continue to follow, the same dragon that attacked the castle appears and threatens to kill them. Just as the dragon is about to attack, Balmor shoves Robin out of the room and collapses the entrance with a bomb he took prior to leaving the castle. Estranged from his friends, Robin carries on, regretfully leaving Balmor and Harold to their inevitable fates. Continuing on his new odyssey, Robin gets wind of the Princess being spotted in the Canary Continent. As he heads there through a mountain pass, he encounters an old man who cautions him of the dangers of the area. Without heeding his warning, Robin attempts to cross a bridge and subsequently an earthquake starts, collapsing the bridge and causing Robin to fall from the summit. Robin awakens in a room and is greeted by Dr. Julia Melrose, who promptly treated his injuries. Julia expresses her surprise at how quickly Robin healed, commenting that for most people, it would've taken months to heal. Their conversation is cut short as a townsperson quickly enters to warn Julia of monsters that have managed to enter the town. Julia quickly leaves Robin to rest and is met by 3 powerful monsters that have managed to seriously wound a large number of the townsfolk. Demonstrating her prowess in magic, Julia easily dispatches 2 of the monsters; however, the last one left is much stronger and managed to erect a high level magic shield, making her attack powerless. Just as the demon is about to kill Julia, Robin quickly intervenes, stopping the full speed attack of the monster with only his sword. Completely baffled and taken aback at seeing such a strong human, the monster attempts to press his attack further, but is pushed back by Robin. Shattering his magic shield with a single stroke of his sword, Robin mounts a terrific attack against the monster, cutting him in half lengthwise in a spectacular display. Julia, in disbelief at how quickly he was able to heal and fight given his injuries, promptly runs up to him just as he collapses from fatigue. After Robin fully recovers, he assists Julia in procuring a magical feather to help cure a sick child and then quickly continues on his journey. Just as he enters an ice cavern connecting the continent, he is attacked and frozen solid into a magical ice prison set to thaw out within the next thousand years. Julia, feeling something is wrong, wishes to go with him yet at the same time expresses her doubts given her elderly grandmother's condition. Her grandmother, hearing her self-doubts, presses her on to go and follow Robin, knowing well that Julia has already fallen in love with him. Julia thanks her grandmother and with her magic frees Robin and joins him. They eventually find a fairy forest, where Robin begins to learn about his family's roots from the fairy. Robin and Julia eventually meet with a tomboyish fighting monk named Vivian who leaves her convent in an attempt to find their own town's amulet which was reportedly stolen. Robin and Julia eventually chase Vivian to a bandit hideout where they witness her fighting with the bandit leader, Galious Ruding. As the four begin to learn about the powers of the amulet and the amulet found at the destroyed laboratory in the Hyneld Continent, they begin to understand their link towards the reawakening of the 8 Demon Dragons, their need to stop Killbait, and their desire to help Robin find Patricia Hyneld. As the game progresses, Robin begins to slowly subconsciously unlock his own hidden powers as one of the Solfords. The party learns of the lineage of the Solford family and their terrifying powers and their struggle against the Dark Ones. When they finally find Patricia, to Robin's horror, her mind and body are corrupted and twisted into evil by Dr. Killbait who encased her in a suit of high technology powered armor. As Robin attacks Killbait out of rage, Patricia intervenes and easily fends off Robin with a forceful blast of energy. Robin and Patricia duel each other in a terrific magic battle with Robin being able to easily shield his friends from her attacks using his powers. In the midst of the attack Patricia comes to her senses and stops her attack at the extreme protest of Killbait. Unable to detach herself from the armor as it is directly connected to her body, she begs Robin to stop Killbait and to erase the darkness from the world as she slowly ascends and sacrifices herself by causing her armor to self- destruct. Upon seeing the death of his adoptive sister and closest friend, Robin loses control of himself and is about to charge and attack Killbait when he is stopped at the pleading of Julia. Robin then swears an oath of vengeance against Killbait just as he is making his escape. Near the end of the game, Robin manages to procure the legendary Helios Sword, the sword of the Solford family; and, recreates the Soul Armor, one of the last pieces of advanced technology armor rendering all weapons and attacks powerless against him. Using their power, Robin manages to fulfill his oath of vengeance on Dr. Killbait and exterminate the rest of the Demon Dragons. As the last of the demon dragons, Babylon, is defeated, the group disbands happily, believing that peace is restored. Robin, choosing to live quietly rather than continue his work as a knight, is joined by Julia and eventually the two are married and have a son, Leon Solford, the main protagonist in Startling Odyssey I: Blue Evolution. 2 years after the defeat of Babylon however, a machine/program left behind from an advanced technological age of humanity recreates one of the Demon Dragons, Sodom, making him more powerful than even Babylon. Taking control of the Big Eye defense satellite, Sodom proceeds to rain down flaming asteroids onto the planet, destroying a large chunk of the Hyneld Continent and several other towns. Having understood what needs to be done, Robin, now in full control of his powers, teleports to see the great wiseman Rossberg and the great dragon and king of the demon world, Galadan. He leaves both the Helios Sword and the Soul Armor in their custody and teleports himself to the Tower of Stars where he is sent via a teleport pad directly to the Big Eye; Robin destroying the Tower's teleport pad as a safeguard. With no way to return home, Robin confronts Sodom and the two engage in a quick, but extremely fierce battle. Sodom, many times stronger than he was 2 years ago, impales Robin through his armor with his claw. Using his powers however, Robin absorbs Sodom's own power and, channeling all of his own life into one final attack, Robin releases his full power and disintegrates and vaporizes Sodom with a flash of light. Having used all his life energy and after taking a severe mortal blow from Sodom, Robin dies a noble death with his final words, \\"Julia, I leave the future in your hands.\\" Robin dies, just as the satellite self-destructs; its explosion visible to everyone on the planet. As the light of the explosion sparkles, Julia (now Julia Solford) watches tearfully and smiles as she thanks Robin for the gift of his child. ==PlayStation== Startling Odyssey I: Blue Evolution was the only PlayStation remake to actually see release.

The cars have evolved and specialised, but it remains a very popular class of racing. The formulae currently races with the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) and is a Motor Sports Association (MSA) recognised club. The largest and most successful Clubman racing series is the Caterham Racing family of classes that race in United Kingdom and France. ==Birth== The class was initiated by Nick Syrett of the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC) and organised by the Clubmans Register which represent car owners, drivers and constructors. Clubmans evolved from categories such as the 1,172 cc formula for Ford-based specials and several of the 750MC's entry-level formulae. It was intended as a low-cost formula for open-top, front-engined road-going sports cars like the Lotus 7, which had been crowded out of the mainstream by rear-engined cars such as the Lotus 23. Before long, the cars rapidly evolved into highly specialised and very quick sports-racers – retaining the front- engined/rear wheel drive layout, but acquiring in due course wings and slicks. Unlike endurance-oriented forms of sports car racing, Clubmans tend to run at club-level meetings. Races were typically short (15–30 miles) and driver changes and refueling were not part of the strategy. A Chevron B1 Clubmans car Marques such as Chevron made their debut in the formula and the long-lived series of Mallock U2 cars came to dominate numerically (and often in terms of results). Over the years, marques such as Gryphon, Centaur, Bladon, Haggispeed, Phantom, Vision, Pulsar and Slique as well as specials like the St Bruno Roughcutter and the Hustler graced the grids with varying degrees of success. Clubmans cars also became a popular class in hillclimbing. Clubmans has remained a relatively low-cost formula with cars having a long life and stability of rules meaning that drivers tend to remain in the formulae and develop their cars. In a straight line, Clubmans cars were often almost as quick as Formula Three single-seaters. The formula acquired a reputation for close competition, varied grids, and a healthy social scene. ==Development== Engine rules varied somewhat over time. Initially the formula used 1000 cc or 1500 (later 1600) cc pushrod engines that had to be based on Ford or BMC units – practically, the 1,000 cc units were detuned ex-F3 engines). For most of the formula's life, the engines were the 1000 cc ex F3 units and 1600 cc Ford Kents or Ford-based Holbay, and finally the 1600 Kent in Formula Ford spec (\\"B sports/Sports 1600\\") and 1700 cc crossflow units (\\"A sports\\") in high states of tune. As the Ford units drifted into obsolescence, other units replaced them. Sports 1600 gave way to \\"K Sports\\" with a Rover K-series engine and the 16-valve two-litre Vauxhall temporarily replaced the 1700 cc Crossflow unit in 1993 for the short-lived rear-engined Supersports category. Rear-engined cars with the Vauxhall unit were admitted to the series for the first time in 1995 alongside traditional front-engined cars. Seeking a more upmarket image, the alternative formula was renamed National Supersports, but over the years grids declined due to increased costs. Many of the marques that made their debut in National Supersports now compete in alternative prototype series such as Britsports or VdeV, which provide prototype racing on a relatively affordable scale. ==Currently== Clubmans in the UK continues as a highly popular and affordable form of racing with two race series catering for \\"Classic\\" cars (up to and including 1980 running almost exactly as the original formula with classes catering for cars from most periods of the formula's history) and the modern \\"Cup\\" series running the re-badged MG 1600cc engines plus the new for 2011 \\"Proto\\" class to include engines up to 2 litres and 240 bhp at the flywheel, plus the option of paddle-shift sequential 5-speed gearboxes. Caterham Cars has run a series of one-make championships for over a decade in the United Kingdom, Caterham Seven 420R Championship, Caterham Seven 310R Championship, Caterham Seven 270R Championship, Caterham Roadsport Championship, Caterham Academy Championship as well as associated series run by Caterham Graduates Racing Club, Mega Graduate, SigMax Graduate and Classic Graduate. Caterham also run a series in France while other Caterham series run in Colombia, Malaysia and Japan amongst other countries. There is also a one- make series for Westfield Clubmans in the Netherlands and there are more open series in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa, Sweden amongst others. ==Outside the UK== Clubmans has also been popular in Scandinavia since the 80s when Swedish based Stefan Mumm bought a Mallock and promoted the formulae. The results of his enthusiasm are more than 20 cars registered in the series. As well as the ubiquitous Mallock, local Marques such as Bodin and Phantom are now produced and are still being developed; in 2008 three brand new cars were produced. The Scandinavian Clubmans class uses 1800 cc Ford Zetec engine, and is one of the fastest sportcar series in Scandinavia. Clubmans cars also compete in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Switzerland. ==External links== * The Clubmans Register * Scandinavian clubman register Category:Sports car racing Category:Racing car classes ","title":"Clubman (racing car class)"},{"id":"9079529","text":"In manufacturing, an airshaft is a device used for handling winding reels in the processing of web-fed materials, such as continuous-process printing presses. Airshafts—also called Air Expanding shafts—are used in the manufacturing processes for fitting into a core onto which materials such as paper, card and plastic film are wound. An airshaft is designed so that, on fitting into a core, it can be readily expanded, thereby achieving a quick and firm attachment, it may also be easily deflated to facilitate easy withdrawal of the shaft after winding of product is complete. Their efficient design makes them ideal for mounting onto bearing housings to enable the winding or unwinding of rolls of stock material with the minimum of equipment down time. The advantage of using an airshaft is its ability to grip the core, without damage, whilst providing a positive interface to control the web via motors & brakes. Airshafts are available as either lug type (with bladder down the centre) or strip type (bladders on the periphery of the shaft). Air shafts are used on many converting machines. An example of one of these machines is a slitting machine or slitter rewinder which is used to cut or slit large rolls of material into smaller rollers. Air shaft is a machine part or shaft which tightens the core or roll on filling air. Air Shafts are of two types: # Contains Inflatable Rubber tube inside also called Lug shafts. # Which contains bladder multiple outside also called Multi-tube Shaft . In Lugs type Air shaft, shaft consist of air bladder inside it. It is manufactured using Aluminium or Iron pipe as outer pipe in which there are u-shaped slot are there in which lugs are fitted manually. Then Inflatable bladder placed inside pipe below lugs. Then bladder is connected using a brass air valve. So, when we fill air using Air valve the bladder inflated and lugs comes out of shafts body (pipe) and tights the core in which shafts is placed. In Multi tube Air Shafts there are small flat tubes placed outside the body of shafts which get in round shapes on filling air in it using Brass Air Valve and Lugs comes out of body and tight the core. These times Air Shafts & Multi tube Shafts are finding very important placed in industries where they use any kind of cores or rolls.

The drama follows the lives of a group of workers who work at a modern day plant. While work gets tougher and more dangerous, their wages are being cut, and benefits reduced. Into the fray walks Cod, a strange young man who tries to inspire them to action. But Cod has his own secrets, which include once being a scab, and is in a long term battle with the cool Sausage Man, a battle whose outcome will affect them all in deadly ways.

Extended use may result in a dryness of the mouth. ===Contraindications=== Not to be used with heart diseases, angina pectoris and decompensated cardiac insufficiency, glaucoma, hyper-excitability and thyrotoxicosis or while treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. ===Overdose=== Symptoms of overdose are nausea, agitation and restlessness, dryness of the mouth, dizziness and tremor. In gross overdosage also associated with dyspnoea, tachycardia, disorientation and convulsions. ==Research== In a study on slices of rat corpus striatum and substantia nigra fencamfamin acted as an indirect dopamine agonist. It released dopamine by a similar mechanism to amphetamines, but was ten times less potent than dexamphetamine at producing this effect. The main mechanism of action was instead inhibition of dopamine reuptake. Also unlike amphetamines, fencamfamin does not inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase enzymes. It was concluded that, at least in the models employed, the in vitro profile of fencamfamin is more similar to that of nomifensine, a reportedly pure uptake inhibitor, than to d-amphetamine. In animal experiments on place preference fencamfamin produced a significant place preference only at the dose of 3.5 mg/kg. The experiments suggested a relation to dopamine D1 receptors, and also to opioid receptors in the reinforcement produced by fencamfamin, as place preference was blocked by the selective dopamine D1 antagonist SCH 23390 and by the opioid antagonist naloxone. A similar place preference, which was blocked by naloxone and by SCH 23390 and by raclopride, has been seen in a study on rats with drinking water. Animals treated with naloxone before the conditioning sessions showed a place aversion instead of the place preference found in saline-treated animals. Naloxone also reduced drinking. It was proposed that naloxone induced a state of frustrative nonreward. It was suggested that both dopamine and (endogenous) opioids are important for water-induced reinforcement. Possible interactions between these two neurotransmitter systems were discussed. ==Synthesis== Preparation of fencamfamin precursor Fencamfamin may be synthesized in a straightforward fashion via the Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and β-nitrostyrene (1-nitro-2-phenyl-ethene). The C=C double bond and the nitro- group in the resulting norcamphene derivative are then reduced to give the saturated norcamphane derivative. Finally, the amino-group is ethylated. Although β-nitrostyrene is commercially available, it is also very easily prepared using the Henry Reaction between benzaldehyde and nitromethane. The Diels-Alder reaction of β-nitrostyrene and cyclopentadiene is described in a number of early papers. The reduction of the nitroalkene may be carried out sequentially. The alkene's double bond is typically reduced using hydrogen and a transition metal catalyst like Ni or Pt, while the nitro group is reduced to the amine with a metal/acid combination, such as Fe/HCl. The reduction of both functional groups can also be achieved simultaneously by the use of Raney nickel, and this transformation has recently been optimized by Russian chemists. Originally achieved under reductive amination conditions involving the reaction of the amine with acetaldehyde in the presence of Pt, ethylation of the amino-group has been improved by the use of Ra-Ni and ethanol. The stereochemical consequences of the steps involved in the reaction sequence outlined above have been studied. Thus, the Diels-Alder cycloaddition leads to a product in which the nitro- and phenyl- groups are in a trans- relationship to each other. This product is actually a mixture of stereoisomers, in which the pair of enantiomers having the nitro- group in the endo- position and the phenyl- group in the exo- position predominates over the enantiomeric pair with exo-nitro and endo-phenyl groups. Although the isomeric composition of the Diels-Alder adduct itself does not seem to have been determined, Poos et al. reported a ratio of ~3:1 for the saturated un-ethylated amine derived from it. Novakov and co-workers, citing a thesis study, report that the corresponding ratio of endo-N-ethyl/exo-Φ : exo-N-ethyl/endo-Φ enantiomeric pairs is ~9:1 in fencamfamin itself. == See also == *Camfetamine == References == Category:Stimulants Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors ","title":"Fencamfamin"},{"id":"9079600","text":"The Essential Collection 1995–2005 is a compilation studio album released by the melodic hard rock band Ten.

It was located on the Columbia River on Wappatoo Island near the future Portland, Oregon. After a few years, in 1837 Wyeth sold the post to the British Hudson’s Bay Company, which had much more power in the region from its base at Fort Vancouver on the north side of the Columbia River near Fort William. In 1835 the fort settlement was the site of a murder and the first Euro-American trial to be held in what is now the state of Oregon. ==Background== The fort was built by Wyeth and his company as part of the Pacific Trading Company, a joint-stock company formed by Wyeth to exploit the fur trade in the Oregon Country. Henry Hall of Boston's xx He also held Fort Hall in southeastern Idaho, to take advantage of trade in the Rocky Mountain region. His intention was to establish a fishery at Fort William, and export salmon to the East and Hawaii. The island chosen was previously visited by the Lewis & Clark Expedition, and was previously inhabited by Native Americans. By the time Wyeth established his outpost, the island was void of any human habitation due to epidemics of infectious diseases that had swept through the lower Columbia region. As the Natives did not have any immunity to the new Eurasian diseases, nearly 90% of them died from smallpox, measles and other illnesses following European contact.Oregon History Project: Spreading Old World Contagions. Oregon Historical Society. Retrieved on February 26, 2008. ==Location== Wappatoo Island, now Sauvie Island, lies just north of the main confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The north end of the island is at the confluence with the Multnomah Channel. The post was built on the north end of the island, but was moved the next year toward the center of the island due to seasonal flooding. Fort William was west of and on the opposite side of the river from the Hudson’s Bay Company’s (HBC) Fort Vancouver, established in 1824 on the north side of the Columbia. It was about upriver from the mouth of the Columbia and the HBC post of Fort George (formerly Fort Astoria). ==Operation== Wyeth and crew attempted various commercial interests from their outpost in the Pacific Northwest. They cut lumber and exported it to the Hawaiian Islands, built boats and canoes, and built a -long building to use in processing fish. They intended to ship salmon to the East and to Hawaii. Wyeth and his employees also attempted to trap animals in the Deschutes River watershed of central Oregon. They were unsuccessful and the young company was unable to survive against the HBC and, in the Rocky Mountains, the American Fur Company, made a monopoly by John Jacob Astor. John Ball, one of Wyeth's men, wrote that they were no match for the HBC, which up fur trade prices as much as ten to one whenever any American trader appeared on the lower Columbia River. online at Google Books The post had difficulties; its first supply ship sent to the Northwest Coast wrecked, and the second ship was late. The first ship was being used to export salmon. Wyeth abandoned the post in 1836 and the following year, leased it to the Hudson’s Bay Company. After Wyeth left the Pacific Northwest, John McLoughlin, the Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, ordered Fort William demolished and a dairy farm built on the island. Wyeth also sold Fort Hall in present-day Idaho to the HBC the following year. ==Murder== Fort William was the site of the first public trial, by European Americans, in Oregon. In 1835, the post’s gunsmith, Thomas J. Hubbard, attacked and killed the fort’s tailor in an argument over a young Native girl. The naturalist John Kirk Townsend was appointed magistrate, although he was a friend of Hubbard's. The jury acquitted Hubbard when they ruled the death was justifiable homicide. This verdict was likely the result of evidence that the tailor had alcohol-induced rages. ==References== William Category:Fur trade Category:History of Portland, Oregon Category:Oregon Country Category:Pre- statehood history of Oregon Category:Sauvie Island Category:1834 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Fort William (Oregon)"},{"id":"9079689","text":"Crackdown is a 2007 action-adventure game developed by Realtime Worlds and distributed by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Crackdown was conceived by Realtime Worlds founder, David Jones, who also created Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings. Set in the fictional Pacific City, the player controls a biologically enhanced Agent, tasked with defeating three crime lords and their organized crime syndicates. The Agent's abilities improve by defeating both crime lords and their top subordinates, as well as by completing optional activities, such as street races and scavenger hunts. The gameplay is nonlinear: instead of following a rigid mission sequence, players are free to select the approach to completing their missions and activities. The game features a two-player cooperative play mode via Xbox Live. It was released worldwide in February 2007. Crackdown, initially planned for release on the original Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast world in which players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta. The game sold 1.5 million copies in its first six months of release. It received critical acclaim from reviewers and is widely considered to be the best entry to the series. It has garnered several awards for its innovative gameplay. A sequel, Crackdown 2, was released in July 2010 by Ruffian Games without Jones' input, and Crackdown 3 was released for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in February 2019, again directed by Jones. ==Plot== Crackdown takes place in the fictional metropolis of Pacific City, whose several districts and areas are divided among four islands. The city is controlled by three criminal organizations: Los Muertos (which means \\"the dead ones\\" in Spanish), a street gang of drug dealers from Central America who runs \\"La Mugre\\"; The Volk (Russian for \\"Wolf\\"), a militia group from Eastern Europea who dominates \\"The Den\\"; and the Shai-Gen Corporation, a formerly above-board, corrupt governing body from East Asia that rules \\"The Corridor\\". Normally, a police-like organization called the Peacekeepers kept the city under control; their forces, however, were overwhelmed by the sudden rise in crime. The city, therefore, sought additional help from \\"the Agency\\", an organization that, in addition to outfitting and supporting Peacekeepers, has used advanced surgical and cybernetic technology to create supersoldiers known as \\"Agents\\". The Agency is based out of a former hotel in the very centre of the city. The player takes on the role of one of their Agents, and is tasked with systematically bringing down all three organized gangs, while keeping both the populace and Peacekeepers safe. The Agent's actions are continuously monitored by the Agency, and its Director (voiced by Michael McConnohie) provides continuous reports to him of his progress. Throughout the game, the player roams Pacific City, systematically eliminating the leaders of the three gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent that there was an ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order. ==Gameplay== Crackdown is a third-person shooter set in a sandbox environment, akin to Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. After selecting one of the predefined Agent characters, the player is assigned to defeat the Kingpin of each gang, though there is no precise approach to do this, leaving players to select their preferred method. While the player may face the Kingpin and his bodyguards at any time, they can improve their chances of taking out the Kingpin by facing and defeating the various Generals responsible for certain aspects of the Kingpin's offense and defense, removing them from play. For example, by eliminating a gang's weapon dealer, gang members will no longer be as heavily armed or will fire fewer shots to conserve ammunition; assassinating the gang recruitment officer similarly reduces the size of the Kingpin's protective force. It is at the player's discretion whether to kill the Generals or skip them entirely before facing the Kingpin. However, the gangs cannot be completely eradicated from the city without tracking down and killing all Generals and Kingpins. In Crackdown, the Agent can use many super-human powers, including enhanced strength, to defeat his enemies. Much like other sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and explosives to fight the opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate the city. Crackdown features a series of character- based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific traits that can be used in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: \\"Agility\\", which increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; \\"Driving\\", affecting how well he can handle a vehicle and upgrades it ; \\"Explosives\\", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and explosive power ; \\"Strength\\" that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift and throw, as well as how hard he can strike an opponent and increases health ; and \\"Firearms\\", which improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdowns skills make few concessions to realism: character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters. Skills are usually improved by gaining experience orbs, which are released from defeated enemies. The type of orb released varies, depending on how the player dispatched the foe; for instance, killing an enemy with a gun will earn Firearms orbs, while running them over with a vehicle earns Driving orbs. More powerful enemies release more experience orbs. However, Agility orbs are awarded differently: they can be earned by either climbing buildings and seeking them on rooftops, or by killing an enemy from a high altitude. The player can also compete in \\"rooftop races\\"—a race through a series of waypoints across the rooftops of Pacific City—or car races to gain Agility and Driving orbs, respectively. A few special orbs, well-hidden, increase all character abilities when found. A final way to collect orbs is by earning Xbox Live Achievements, which rewards the player with orbs from every skill category. Each skill has five levels—beginning with zero stars, and ending with four—with a numeric gauge on the display to indicate how close the player is to the next level. Should the character die, or injure civilians or Agency peacekeepers, their experience gain will be slowed, making it temporarily harder to improve the character's traits. The entirety of Pacific City may be explored from the start of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down. Crackdown features an online two-player cooperative play mode that allows drop-in play. Both players may explore the city freely, with the other player's position noted on the HUD map. Players can fight alongside each other, and also inflict friendly-fire damage. The state of the city, including which Generals and Kingpins remain, is determined by the host player's progress. Both players are credited with the defeat of a General or Kingpin in the game—which will affect the state of the guest's progress—but are required to obtain supply points and gain experience independently. Co-op players can race against each other in both rooftop and road races, should they both choose to participate. ==Development== Crackdown was envisioned to exceed the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player \\"toys\\" to create their own in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. The crackdown logo is in the shape of the agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. \\"It was a big part of the idea to just let people do things\\", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; \\"testers would do things we were completely blown away by\\". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as \\"How do we reward somebody for just having fun?\\" They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player may not realize the potential of the game and would not complete it; \\"People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games\\". Jones also expressed concern that \\"This game does not look good in screenshots\\". They took two major steps to overcome this. First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do. Wilson stated that development of the game began in 2002 with a target release in 2005 on the original Xbox. Nine people were involved in the initial development for twelve months with plans to expand to 35 during full development. By February 2004, they were able to provide a playable demo, but recognized there were still several challenges with the game's progression. For example, the team introduced \\"skills for kills\\" where skill points were only rewarded for killing foes instead of allowing the player to gain them by less risky opportunities. They also included the frequent reporting of the player's current chance of success for a player of defeating a Kingpin to prevent the player from being frustrated by trying to fight Kingpins beyond their level. By 2004, Microsoft brought the team the Xbox 360 hardware and suggested moving the game to that system, with a release date in the spring of 2006. By November 2004, the whole of Pacific City was in place, and cooperative mode was possible. However, in January 2005 they switched to the Renderware 4 engine, which caused many problems and was considered a \\"gross mistake\\" by Wilson. Microsoft was able to provide additional programmers to help during 2006 to correct the problems, just in time to create a demo for the 2006 E3 Convention. Wilson admitted that when Crackdown was first unveiled, the team thought the game was too early to debut. \\"By the time we got to the end of pre-production we were woefully understaffed and over budget\\", Wilson commented. Microsoft found that by October 2006, the game had fallen into the bottom 30 percent in test player reaction of all games currently in testing, and the bottom 50 percent in interest, though the numbers improved after a month. To help the struggling game, Microsoft decided to package the Halo 3 multiplayer trial with the game. \\"It was a great boost\\", said Wilson. Jones also was positive about the tie-in with the Halo 3 trial; \\"We kind of knew Crackdown would need as much help as it could get to get into players' hands ... Like we've always said: It's a game player's game. It's not something that's going to sell in screenshot. So [the Halo 3 beta] was good\\". A map of Pacific City from Crackdown, demonstrating the sectors used for debugging the game Pacific City within the game consists of 495 \\"city blocks\\" which the player could travel among, according to Microsoft Game Studios' Jami Johns. Each block had to be tested separately, so Microsoft Game Studios designed a software tool to track issues when the game was in testing. For example, the tool was able to identify blocks where the performance dropped or the game crashed, allowing the developers to redesign the area to remove the issues. A further tool was used for the \\"seams\\" between city blocks, and included a screenshot just prior to any problem, which significantly reduced the debugging time for the game; this tool was further used with Forza Motorsport 2. However, the team had found some bugs during testing that actually worked well as game mechanics without throwing off the game balance. For example, the ability to drive the Agency SUV up a vertical wall when the player has maxed out his driving skill was originally a bug within the game. ===Promotion=== A Crackdown demo was released via Xbox Live Marketplace on 23 January 2007. It was originally dated for 18 January 2007, but was delayed due to Microsoft's certification process. This demo includes both single player and co-op play, but does not allow for jump-in co-op as seen in Gears of War. Silver account members received the demo one week later. The demo lasts for, at most, one hour, with a timer starting when either the player trains a skill to the second level, has eliminated two of the gang Generals, or has been playing for a half-hour. At that point, a 30-minute timer will start, after which the demo automatically ends. During the demo, in-game skills can be trained up to the highest level, and this occurs at an accelerated rate in order to give players an example of higher-level abilities. The Crackdown demo quickly broke download records for Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace by becoming the most downloaded demo over a 24-hour period and a seven-day (week- long) period. In the week after its release, the Crackdown demo was the second most played Xbox Live game after Gears of War. The demo went on to become the most downloaded and most played overall by March 2007. Every pre-ordered and specially marked copy of Crackdown included an invitation to the beta test of the highly anticipated Halo 3. The Crackdown game disc was required to download and launch the Halo 3 beta through the in-game menus. On 10 April 2007, Bungie announced that the beta would become available for download for those that own this copy of Crackdown on 16 May 2007. This beta was playable for three weeks from when it was downloadable. ===Downloadable content=== On 19 February 2007, a free downloadable pack was made available for the game. The pack includes four new playable male agents, three of whom have unique, upgradable headgear. A free update was released on 11 May 2007, which allows the player to reset gangs, makes it easier to find orbs, improves stunt ring visibility, enhances targeting and camera angles when driving, and provides several other minor fixes. This update also includes a new ground strike attack. Two packs of downloadable content were released on 10 May 2007. The \\"Free-For-All\\" pack, which is available free, adds a mode called \\"Keys to the City\\" to the main menu. It allows the player to impound any vehicle and store it at the Agency and allows the player to enter a \\"Keys to the City\\" mode that allows them to alter the Agent's statistics or create several items, and other effects, but disables progress within the game. \\"Gettin Busy\\" bonus pack, introduces new vehicles and weapons, new side missions, and street racing. As of 6 September 2007, the \\"Gettin' Busy\\" pack has been purchased from Xbox Live around 200,000 times. The May 2007 title update and downloadable content were linked to a glitch which reset a number of players' saved games when they played the game's co-operative mode. The developers apologized for the glitch and offered a temporary workaround, however, saved games already lost to the glitch were not recoverable. On 16 May 2007, a further title update was released, resolving the issue, in addition to fixing issues with access to the Halo 3 beta. ===Soundtrack=== The main theme of the game is \\"Paradise Bird Theory\\" by DJ Krush. Crackdown features over 100 tracks of electronica and sample-based music by a number of independent and video game musicians, including Amon Tobin, Atlas Plug, Celldweller and Hybrid. Music supervisor Peter Davenport was in charge of selecting the music for the game, a task that took three years to complete. Davenport was allowed to select music from any source given the premise and missions within the game, and worked with the audio leads at Realtime Worlds to shape the full soundtrack, keeping it to a \\"dark and ominous\\" vibe, rather than \\"super high energy\\". ==Reception== Pacific City, the setting for Crackdown. The Agency Towers can be seen in the left background. The game has been well-received for its long draw distances. Crackdown received generally favorable reviews by game critics who praised the open-world approach. Reviewers commented highly on the graphics of the game, both in its detailed city and large draw distances, and the cel-like shading of the characters; 1UP said that \\"it's just better to let a game approach reality on its own aesthetic terms than to go hyperrealistic\\". X-Play stated, \\"It's an absolute blast to play, and arguably one of the finest superhero games made thus far\\", and IGN stated, \\"Overall the thrill of jumping like a mutant kangaroo from rooftop to rooftop is unrivaled!\\" The co-op play feature over Xbox Live was well received; Eurogamer wrote, \\"Being able to pick and leap into any of your friends' or even complete strangers' cities is likely to keep that buzz going though\\", and 1UP agreed, remarking \\"That it represents the best, if not the first, online multiplayer sandbox game on a console is just gravy\\". Reviews did critique the lack of any appreciable story within the game, and how short the core game itself may be; IGN argued \\"Crackdown won't last that long, it's uneven, and the story and the music are weak sauce\\". Crackdown was not expected to be a good game, due to it being tied to the anticipated Halo 3 multiplayer beta. However, the game surpassed many expectations; in his review, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani asked readers the rhetorical question; \\"Notice that I didn't mention the Halo 3 beta offer during this whole article? That's because it's completely irrelevant when looking at Crackdown, it's a solid game that delivers exactly what it promises: a giant sandbox to blow the crap out of\\". The game was named the 2007 BAFTA \\"Best Action and Adventure Game\\" and \\"Best Use of Audio\\". and also won the \\"Best Debut\\" award at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. The game received the Innovation Award at the 2007 Develop Awards, held by Develop magazine. Game Informer listed it as one of the top 50 games of 2007, citing its unique experience and several other elements. They listed the agents as the number eight top heroes of 2007 and climbing the tallest building in the city as the number nine top moment of 2007. ===Sales=== Crackdown premiered to very strong sales. During the week of its worldwide release of February 2007, it was the top selling Xbox 360 game in North America, Japan, and the UK. The game was the top selling game in North America for the month of February 2007, selling 427,000 units. Ultimately, by the end of 2007, the game sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game is not sold in Germany due to the USK's decision not to rate the game; according to GameSpot, this was due to pending legislation at the time to create criminal penalties for games that included \\"cruel violence on humans or human-looking characters\\". ==Sequels== Wilson and lead designer Billy Thomson had previously confirmed that Crackdown was designed from the outset to be a long- running series of games, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying \\"Microsoft was a little late in stepping up to the plate to ask for Crackdown 2, and by then we had already started working on bigger, better things\\". However, then- corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility. Realtime Studios manager Colin MacDonald clarified that if they have the resources after completion of APB, they could approach Microsoft to discuss a sequel. At Microsoft's E3 conference on 1 June 2009, it was announced that Crackdown 2 was at that point of time being developed by a Scottish develop Ruffian Games, formed by members of the Realtime Worlds team. Along with the announcement, an accompanying trailer was released. Crackdown 2 was released on 6 July 2010 in the U.S. and Canada and on 9 July throughout the rest of the world. Crackdown 2 received mixed reviews. A third title in the series, Crackdown 3 was set to be released worldwide in 2016, which was then changed to 7 November 2017 simultaneously with the Xbox One X, but another delay was announced on 16 August 2017, moving the release back to 2018. In June 2018, the game was confirmed to be delayed again, pushing back to its eventual release date February 2019. Crackdown 3 received mixed reviews. ==References* Crackdown at MobyGames Category:2007 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cancelled Xbox games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Crackdown Category:Dystopian video games Category:Lua (programming language)-scripted video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Parkour video games Category:Open world video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:Realtime Worlds games Category:RenderWare games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games using Havok Category:Video games with cel- shaded animation Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Xbox One X enhanced games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Crackdown (video game)"},{"id":"9079714","text":"One Night with Blue Note is a 1985 feature length jazz film directed by John Charles Jopson.One Night with Blue Note IMDb listing To celebrate record executive Bruce Lundvall having relaunched the defunct Blue Note Records label in 1985 under the parent label EMI Manhattan Records, he and music director Michael Cuscuna staged a concert on February 22, 1985 at The Town Hall in New York City, bringing together some of the jazz legends associated with Blue Note over the years as well as some newly signed artists. The concert, featuring more than 30 of the world’s most revered jazz musicians in the form of all-star ensembles, is considered by many serious jazz fans to be one of the most important nights in jazz history. The 3 hour-plus event was shot on 16mm film with multiple cameras. Director Jopson prepared by studying the music from various live recordings, and then, consulting with producer Tammara Wells plus director of photography Martin Pitts and camera operators Ernest Dickerson, Paul Goldsmith and Don Lenser, determined the camera positions. During rehearsals Pitts and long-time associate Lou Tobin designed the lighting for show. The lighting team was joined by the crew from Chorus Line which had just closed on Broadway. The film is known for its intimate close- ups of the musicians, showing their subtle signals to each other and acknowledgment of well-played riffs.

It did not describe any status of citizenship, but granted to communities outside Italy the legal fiction that they were on Italian soil. This meant that it was governed under Roman rather than local or Hellenistic law, had a greater degree of autonomy in their relations with provincial governors, all those born in the city automatically gained Roman citizenship, and the city's land was exempt from certain taxes. As citizens of Rome, people were able to buy and sell property, were exempt from land tax and the poll tax and were entitled to protection by Roman law. The early Roman Empire saw the creation of colonies; settlers in Roman citizen colonies (colonia civium Romanorum) had the same rights as legal privileges as cives. Military Roman colonies founded by Augustus were to house the civil war veterans while overseas civilian colonies were settled by Roman civilians who were deprived of their property by returning soldiers. Ancient literary sources enumerate some of the cities that were granted the privilege of Ius Italicum. The Digest (50.15) lists Roman colonies that were granted the privilege of ius Italicum. This list comprises 16 colonies founded by Augustus Caesar: Berytus, Apamea, Sinope, Philippi, Alexandria Troas, Dyrrhacium, Pax Julia, Emerita, Valentia, Ilici, Lugdunum, Vienna, Cassandrea, Dium, Parium, Antioch of Pisidia. The colony of Carthage was founded by Caesar, re-founded by Augustus and given Ius Italicum by Septimius Severus. In his \\"Natural History\\" (3.25), Pliny adds Acci and Libisosa to the list of Augustan cities possessing Ius Italicum. Other cities founded to house Augustus' military legions were identified through epigraphical and numismatic evidence. These cities are believed to have also been granted Ius Italicum: Arausio, Baeterrae, Barcino, Caesaraugusta, Cartenna, Corduba, Forum Julii, Gunugu, Narbo, Patrae, Rusazu, Rusguinae, Saldae, Thermae Himeraeae, Thuburbo Minus, Thuburnica, Tubusuctu and Uthina. Under the Claudius, the Flavians and Trajan, three colonies are known to have had Ius Italicum; Ara Agrippinensium founded by Cluadian, is attested in the Digest. Agrippa founded the colony of Ara Ubiorum.

Born in New York City, and Jewish, he stood (173 cm) tall, weighed 150 pounds (68 kg), and batted and threw right-handed. ==Baseball career== Pitler began his professional playing career in at Jackson of the Class C Southern Michigan Association. When that league disbanded in , Pitler was picked up by the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Class A Southern Association. He was batting a healthy .364 in 42 games when his contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the midseason of during the World War I manpower crisis. He played in 109 games for Pittsburgh that season, and two contests in , compiling a .232 average in 383 at bats with no home runs and 23 runs batted in. He then joined the war effort. During much of the 1920s, Pitler was out of \\"organized\\" minor league baseball, playing in semi-professional or \\"outlaw\\" leagues. But in , he joined the Binghamton Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League and became a fixture in that circuit, playing also for Elmira and Hazleton, and beginning his managing career in with Scranton. In , Pitler joined the Brooklyn Dodgers as a minor league manager, winning back-to-back pennants with the Olean Oilers of the PONY League in 1939–40. He was promoted to the Dodger coaching staff in and served through the end of the team's stay in Brooklyn in — through six National League championships and Brooklyn's lone world title, which came in . Pitler usually served as Brooklyn's first-base coach and worked under Dodger managers Leo Durocher, Burt Shotton, Chuck Dressen and Walter Alston. He appeared in Roger Kahn's memoir The Boys of Summer as a somewhat obsequious aide to Dressen. But with his minor league managing background, he was also hailed as a fatherly figure to Dodger rookies and young players. He was cited for that role in poet Marianne Moore's paean to the 1955 champions, Hometown Piece for Messrs. Alston and Reese. After retiring as a coach after the season rather than moving with the Dodgers to Los Angeles, Pitler continued his association with the team as a scout. He died in Binghamton, New York, in at the age of 73. In 1991, he was inducted into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Pitler holds the record for most putouts in a game by a second baseman, with 15, made in a 22 inning game on August 22, 1917. ==See also== *List of select Jewish baseball players ==References== *Bucek, Jeanine, ed., The Baseball Encyclopedia, 10th edition.

Carney said, \\"Virtually with no exception, everyone I dealt with in those administrations, whether I personally agreed or disagreed with what they thought were the right policy decisions or the right way to approach things, I never doubted that they were patriots,” he said. “I don’t feel that way now.\\" He later walked back the comments with a tweet saying he has respect for countless patriots working in the United States government. During the sixth game of the 2019 World Series, Carney sent out a tweet complaining about the officiating of the game. Carney tweeted that the officiating was a \\"disgrace,\\" dubbing the umpires \\"a bunch of overweight, diabetic, half-blind geriatrics.\\" He apologized the following day. ==Awards== In 2003, Carney won the Gerald R. Ford prize for distinguished reporting on the presidency of the United States of America. ==Personal life== Carney lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife, Claire Shipman, a best-selling author and former correspondent for ABC News, NBC News and CNN, and their two children.

Tangpyeongchae is seasoned with a sauce made with ganjang, vinegar, sugar, sesame seeds and sesame oil. The dish is most often eaten in late spring and summer. ==History== According to Dongguksesigi (hangul: , hanja: 東國歲時記), a book written in 1849, tangpyeongchae derived from a political situation. King Yeongjo of the Joseon dynasty was concerned about severe conflicts between political parties. Therefore, he tried to resolve the strife between major four parties by frequently holding feasts to make the mood friendly. The Tangpyeong policy (hangul: , hanja: 蕩平策) which literally means the policy for \\"harmony\\" and \\"meditation\\" is regarded as his greatest achievement. He selected people regardless of their party affiliation.

His grandmother was Lady Mary Godolphin, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Godolphin, who had married the 4th Duke of Leeds. ==Political career== Osborne sat as Member of Parliament for Helston between 1799 and 1802, for Lewes between 1802 and 1806 and for Cambridgeshire between 1810 and 1831. On 14 May 1832 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Godolphin, of Farnham Royal in the County of Buckingham. ==Family== Elizabeth Charlotte Eden, Lady Godolphin (1780-1847) (William Beechey) Lord Godolphin married the Honourable Elizabeth Charlotte Eden, third daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, on 31 March 1800.

William traveled in 1836 to India with his cousins George Eden Lord Auckland (Governor General of India); Emily Eden ; and Fanny Eden. While there, William wrote and illustrated his 1840 travel narrative The Camp and Court of Runjeet Sing: With an Introductory Sketch of the Origin and Rise of the Sikh State. In 1843, upon his return to Britain, William married the daughter of famed abolitionist and Cornish MP Matthew Montagu the 4th Baron Rokeby. William's wife was Hon. Caroline Montague. They had no children. His second wife was Georgiana Henrietta Child-Villiers, daughter of Admiral George Keith Villiers Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith. * The Hon. Sidney Godolphin Osborne (1808–1889); became a religious minister. He was the grandfather of the 12th (and last) Duke of Leeds. Known for his letters to The Times signed S.G.O. as well as for his work during the Crimean War with Florence Nightingale and for his advocating for famine victims in the west of Ireland during the Great Irish Famine (1845-1853). See Osborne's Gleanings in the West of Ireland published in 1850 and his Scutari and its Hospitals published in 1855. Sidney married the sister of Pascoe Grenfell. Under Sidney's auspices, he arranged for his close friends Charles Kingsley and James Anthony Froude to marry his wife's two sisters. Kingsley memorializes the Grenfell sisters in his 1848 novel Yeast A Problem. * The Hon. D'Arcy Godolphin Osborne (1814–1846). * The Hon. Charlotte Godolphin Osborne (d. 1838); married Sir Theodore Brinckman, 1st Baronet, becoming Lady Brinckman. The 8th Duke's surviving siblings, William and Sydney, were granted the rank of a younger son of a duke in 1859, becoming Lord William Osborne and Lord Sydney Osborne respectively. This is because their father, Lord Godolphin, would have inherited the dukedom had he not died in 1850; nine years prior to the death of the 7th Duke of Leeds. On Lord Godolphin's death in 1850, his title of Baron Godolphin passed to his eldest son, George, who became the 2nd Baron Godolphin.

Although it was reconstructed for other purposes, the name \\"Theatre Royal\\" was transferred to new premises on the corner of Longbrook Street and New North Road. The new theatre was built by the Exeter Theatre Company to the designs of C. J. Phipps and opened in 1886. The fire of 1887 The theatre is best remembered for the disaster during a dramatisation of Romany Rye (a melodrama by Wilson Barrett) on 5 September 1887, which became the worst theatre fire in British history. Fire broke out backstage where gas lighting ignited some gauze. The number of exits from the gallery of the auditorium proved to be inadequate and in the resultant panic amongst the audience 186 people died. A national appeal for donations for the victims’ families raised £20,763 and the event was influential in the introduction of safety precautions for public buildings. There is a memorial to those who died in the fire in Higher Cemetery, Heavitree. ==The last Theatre== The Theatre Royal was rebuilt, opening in 1889 with a performance of The Yeomen of the Guard by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The new building had lighting by electricity and a safety curtain. During its lifetime the theatre presented melodrama, musical theatre, music hall and ballet as well as drama. Every Christmas of its 20th century existence saw a pantomime. For a period in the 1950s it showed CinemaScope films. The Theatre Royal was closed in 1962 and demolished to be replaced by an office block. Although attempts to save it were unsuccessful, they did lead to creation of the Northcott Theatre. == References == ==Further reading== * * * Category:Theatres in Devon Category:Fires in England Category:Charles J.

Their purpose was to support protests against the planned nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf (German: Wiederaufbereitungsanlage Wackersdorf, abbreviated WAA Wackersdorf) in Wackersdorf. In 1986, the fifth festival marked the peak of the protest movement against the plant. With over 100,000 people attending on July 26 and 27, Burglengenfeld became the venue of the until then-largest rock concert in the history of Germany. The line-up included some of Germany's most popular music acts of the time such as BAP, Die Toten Hosen, Udo Lindenberg, Rio Reiser, Herbert Grönemeyer. The festivals resulted in an unexpected amount of media coverage for the anti-nuclear movement in Germany. Contrary to expectations of government agencies, however, the festival remained completely peaceful. As a result of the overwhelming protests the planned nuclear reprocessing plant was never built. == Beginnings == The first Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival took place in 1982 at the Lanzenanger venue in Burglengenfeld. Primary responsibility for the event was held by the local autonomous youth centre, where many such festivals had taken place before. Between 2,000 and 4,000 people visited the concerts each year. Because many members of the youth centre had actively been participating in the resistance against the recycling plant, the management decided to change the original festival into the Anti- WAAhnsinns Festival. The main purpose of the events was to attract public attention to the problems related to the WAA and the protests. Because of their engagement in culture-related work, the youth centre very quickly managed to come into contact with many Bavarian musicians like Haindling or Biermösl Blosn who also argued against the building of the recycling plant. Because these festivals got more and more positive feedback from the public the idea began to emerge of encouraging big name performers, like BAP, Udo Lindenberg or Herbert Grönemeyer, to take part. Not least of all because of good relations to the management of BAP, the record label EMI Electrola was able to convince their - mostly left-leaning - artists to participate in the festival. In that same year, a live recording of the festival was released as a double LP by this record label. The proceeds of this album were used to support a citizens' initiative against the WAA. Originally, the organizers intended the Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival to take place in the immediate vicinity of the planned FRP. After excessive protests at Easter and Pentecost the position of both parties got more radical, especially influenced by the catastrophe of Chernobyl. As a result, the Bavarian government set up inviolable precincts up to 120 square kilometres around the construction area. Ultimately, the organizers opted for a field near Burglengenfeld as the venue for the festival. Even before preparation for the festival took place, some city councillors of the CSU (Christian Social Union) and the mayor of Burglengenfeld, Stefan Bawidamann, had already voiced their concern about riots on the fringes of the festival. Although the Anti-WAAhnsinns-Festival had been officially authorised by the town, the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior and the local government of Oberpfalz voiced intentions to prohibit the event. An extraordinary meeting of the city council that was scheduled for the 15th of July, again voted in favour of the realization of the festival. However, the town's major Bawidamann repealed the ballot, referring to article 19 of the penal law. He considered this necessary in order to prevent the general public from danger for their life, health or material goods and to save them from heavy disturbances. The decision about the authorisation of the festival thereby passed to the subsequent regulating authority, the district office of Schwandorf. Hans Schuierer, the district administrator, validated the decision of the city council and assigned the local government of Oberpfalz to check the legal force of Bawidamann's decision again. The motorcycle club Kuhle Wampe took charge of security and entrance. Excrements had to be removed almost every hour. Fields within a radius of several kilometers were rent by the festival's management for parking. In part, the fields had to be harvested right before the beginning of the festival although the grain was not ripe yet. The number of visitors exceeded expectations and more fields had to be marked as parking spaces on short notice. At one of those rent fields, in particular on the stubble field in the vicinity of Greinhof, a hot catalyzer set off a large-scale fire. Thanks to the dauntless action of a local farmer who used a plough to create a firebreak, bigger damages could be prevented. == The festival == Burglengenfeld, a city with about 10,000 inhabitants, was not prepared for such a stampede of visitors. Already on the eve of the festival, in the supermarkets all staple food and alcoholic drinks were sold out. Several shops closed their doors and did not open them on the following Sunday either. Not having any mobile phones yet, on all church doors there were pinned written notes, informing when to meet whom and where. Every bare brickwork the visitors used as a \\"roof over their head\\", as a place to sleep. Anyhow, the thefts, damages of property or even riots the inhabitants had feared held off. Accounts about the number of participating visitors at the festival vary. The number is supposed to be over 100,000, which, considering the area, is not entirely unlikely. Musically the Open Air can be revisited on double LP as well as on film. == The impact of the festival == Although the 5th Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival (26–27 July 1986), a protest against the nuclear reprocessing plant, proceeded peacefully and without any violence, the state continued fighting it with undiminished rigidity. The opposition to the WAA ended abruptly with the sudden death of Bavaria's minister president Franz Josef Strauss on 3 October 1988. The operating company DWK (Deutsche Gesellschaft für die Wiederaufarbeitung von Kernbrennstoffen = German Corporation for Nuclear Reprocessing) and the politicians in the CSU thereupon saw only little chances that the WAA project could be realised successfully. On 30 April 1989, Dr. Rudolf von Bennigsen- Foerder, former chairman of the board of VEBA, announced that German energy companies would retreat from reprocessing technology. This came completely unexpected and filled the CSU with bitterness. On 31 May 1989 the DWK specifically froze the construction of the reprocessing plant and had the iron main gate closed symbolically. After the sudden ending for the WAA, the population's resistance diminished as well. Only a few might remember the matchlessness of the Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival. It was matchless not only because of the 100,000 visitors and all-time greatest spectrum of top musicians, who performed coherently for one special purpose – the building freeze of the WAA. The festival also showed that there is the opportunity of a counter public, the chance to correct and if necessary to prevent the decisions of local and federal administrations in a constitutional state. At the same time the festival suggested the possibility of peaceful protest. Nowadays there is a memorial stone on the former festival site “Lanzenanger” in Burglengenfeld that is to commemorate the spectacular Anti-Atom-Festival. == Literature == * Allnutt, Mike / Herl, Michael (Publisher): WAAhnsinn – Der Wackersdorf-Film.

It is located at a crossing point over the River Marne between Meaux and Château-Thierry. ==History== This area of France has frequently been a site of warfare. In 1819, British naval officer, Norwich Duff (1792–1862), Edinburgh born, recorded a note on La Ferté. The Bourbon Restoration had apparently dampened the Napoleonic road building boom, as evidenced by unused milestones. Construction projects had rebuilt some facilities destroyed in the wars with Britain and other Powers. La Ferté is famous for millstones used for milling flour. Some have even been found in England. Among notable residents, the artist Émile Bayard was born in this town (1837). The Irish avant-garde writer, dramatist, poet and nobel prize winner Samuel Beckett lived in the neighboring hamlet of Mollien for 36 years. The town's library and secondary school are named after him. André the Giant, three times Worldwide Wrestling champion, icon of the André the Giant Has a Posse (aka Obey) street art project grew up in the local canton. As a child, the American writer and filmmaker Oliver Stone used to spend all his summer holiday at his French maternal grands-parents' hotel in La Ferté-sous- Jouarre. The area was invaded and occupied by the Germans from the beginning of the Great War, which led to considerable damage and casualties. After the war, on 14 August 1921, the town of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre was awarded the War Cross with the following citation: On the south-western edge of the town, on the south bank of the River Marne, is the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre memorial, commemorating more than 3000 British soldiers from the Great War with no known grave.

It is best known for the extraordinary figured mosaic depicting the story of Aeneas and Dido. The site is a scheduled ancient monument. It has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register due to the risks from extensive animal burrowing. ==Discovery== The villa was discovered by a local farmer, Herbert Cook, in 1938, whilst digging a hole to bury a dead sheep. Protected from deep ploughing during World War II, it was excavated from 1946 to 1955 by H S L Dewar and C A Ralegh Radford. ==Villa== The villa appears to have been constructed around AD 340 on a gentle slope facing north- east, only about a mile from other villas at High Ham and Pitney. Aerial photography has shown that there are a number of farm buildings around a large courtyard, although the excavations concentrated on the residential west wing and bath house. The baths were particularly impressive. They featured the usual suite of rooms with a deep cold plunge bath and beautiful mosaic floor along its approach. ==Mosaic floor== The large 14 foot (4.3m) square mosaic from the floor of the frigidarium depicts the story of Aeneas and Dido, as told in the 1st century BC by the Roman poet, Virgil. Like the villa, it dates to the mid-4th century. The Low Ham mosaic is unique in Roman Britain in providing a narrative story in five panels. First is a scene of Aeneas sailing to Carthage, with Achates lifting from a ship the crown described as a gift to Dido in Aeneid Book I. The next shows Aeneas meeting Dido, with his son Ascanius and his mother Venus. There follow scenes of the couple out hunting, of the couple embracing, and either of Venus, or else of Dido left alone after Aeneas' departure.Kathryn Thompson and Zahra Newby, \\"Dido and Aeneas in Roman Britain\\", Omnibus vol 69, March 2015, pp 1-3.

She frequently addresses the topics of LGBT acceptance and the role of Latter Day Saint women. ==Personal life== A fourth-generation Latter Day Saint, Pearson was born in Salt Lake City to Lelland Rider Wright and Emeline Sirrine Wright. They would settle in Provo, where Pearson attended Brigham Young High School.Winn, Steven. \\"Mormon author Carol Lynn Pearson tries to separate church and hate.\\" San Francisco Chronicle, August 18, 2007. Retrieved January 27, 2008. Her mother died of breast cancer when Carol Lynn was fifteen. Carol Lynn studied music and theater at Brigham Young University, where she won the award for Best Actress two years in a row. Pearson married actor, musician, and songwriter Gerald Neils Pearson (1942–1984), whom she had met in a college production of The Skin of Our Teeth, on September 9, 1966 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two were devout Latter Day Saints who both descended from several generations of Latter-day Saints. They were married for 12 years and had four children together, settling in Provo, Utah. Gerald had told Carol Lynn while they were engaged that he had had sexual relationships with men, but had left that phase of his life behind. Latter Day Saint authorities also assured the couple that marriage would turn Gerald into a heterosexual. However, he eventually confronted his homosexuality and after a move to California prompted by his desire to explore this side of himself, they separated and were divorced in 1978. He returned to live with her and their children after being diagnosed with AIDS in 1984, and she cared for him until his death. Her book Goodbye, I Love You is about their life together. Since then, Pearson has become an unofficial spokesperson for acceptance of gay people by their Latter Day Saint families, as well as a stronger leadership role for women in the Latter Day Saint community. Many of her works address these issues, and she speaks on these and related subjects around the country. She notes, \\"I love the Mormon community ... and I have a unique opportunity to build bridges.\\" Pearson's daughter Emily (b. 1968) is an actressimdb.com \\"Emily Pearson\\" and writer who is the author of Dancing With Crazy (2011), a memoir of her life and family.

Cobra subsidiary Appco has responded to such criticisms on its official site.http://www.appcogroup.co.uk/about-us/mythbusters When a donor signs up to give money to a charity for 12 months, more than 90 per cent of that money goes to Appco in some cases. Workers in Australia who failed to meet sales targets have been made to perform humiliating rituals involving simulated sex or \\"slug racing\\", which involves writhing on their stomachs across the ground. The Cobra Group has hundreds of associated companies, often listed separately under different names. ==Investigations== A Zimbabwean woman won a legal case against a Cobra Group affiliate for unfair treatment in the workplace. She was awarded €5000 in compensation for \\"harassment and discriminatory treatment\\" and €45000 for discriminatory dismissal. The main argument the company used in defending its case was that the worker in question had been a self-employed sole trader and not actually an employee of his company. Prior to the dismissal the worker in question had been lauded as the highest fundraiser within Boss Worldwide Promotions Ltd. An investigation by the media found that one of The Cobra Group's 'subsidiaries', The Coulson Organization, which collects charity for the Red Cross among others, has charity collectors take down private financial information without vetting the staff amongst many other deceptive, unethical or illegal practices. The company said they ask recruits to detail any criminal histories. The investigative journalist said they were given a badge that indicates they had been vetted, though they had never provided any identification. The journalist was told she would make 35 pounds per sale, but was only actually paid half, unless the donor agreed to make continual donations for six months. The BBC investigation led the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Energy Select Committee to release a report threatening to ban energy companies from using direct sales. Video footage showed Cobra Group contracted companies lying to potential customers. In 2014, Special Olympics Australia was in financial trouble after the APPCO Group took more than $7 million of about $12 million that had been raised for the charity, leading to an investigation by the then New South Wales Office of Liquor Gaming and Racing. Some of its activities include stopping people in public or going door to door to try to collect money for charities. On 2 June 2014, the New South Wales Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing announced it would begin an investigation into the conduct of Cobra Group subsidiary Appco over its running of a gift voucher program for Special Olympics Australia. A class action alleging the business an illegal pyramid scheme, underpayment and structured humiliation of Appco charity collectors in Australia was launched in October 2016.http://www.appcoclassaction.com.au/FAQs.pdf Lawyer Rory Markham, from the law firm that is running the class action, has described it as, \\"One of the most systematic and largest underpayment disputes in Australian history, with the victims being young Australians, generous donors, charities and the taxpayers\\". ==Sponsorship== The Cobra Group (and founder Chris Niarchos) have sponsored various types of motorsports drivers since 2003. Chris Niarchos, through the Cobra Group, partnered with Andrew Kirkaldy in 2006 to the form the British racing team then known as \\"AKA Cobra\\". This partnership led to the formation of CRS Racing in 2007. ==References== ==External links== * Cobra Group Category:Retail companies of Hong Kong Category:Marketing companies established in 1986 Category:Direct marketing Category:1986 establishments in Australia ","title":"The Cobra Group"},{"id":"9080075","text":"Westlock is a town in Alberta, Canada.

In the book, Chamberlain advances various racialist and especially völkisch antisemitic theories on how he saw the Aryan race as superior to others, and the Teutonic peoples as a positive force in European civilization and the Jews as a negative one. The book was his best-selling work. ==Synopsis== Published in German, the book focuses on the controversial notion that Western civilization is deeply marked by the influence of the Teutonic peoples. Chamberlain grouped all European peoples--not just Germans, but Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins--into the \\"Aryan race\\", a race built on the ancient Proto-Indo-European culture. At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, he saw the Nordic or Teutonic peoples. Chamberlain's book focused on the claim that the Teutonic peoples were the heirs to the empires of Greece and Rome, something which Charlemagne and some of his successors also believed. He argued that when the Germanic tribes destroyed the Roman Empire, Jews and other non-Europeans already dominated it. The Germans, in this scenario, saved Western civilization from Semitic domination. Chamberlain's thoughts were influenced by the writings of Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), who had argued the superiority of the \\"Aryan race\\". This term was increasingly being used to describe Caucasian or European peoples, as opposed to Jews, who were conceptualised as \\"infusing Near Eastern poison into the European body politic\\". For Chamberlain the concept of an Aryan race was not simply defined by ethno-linguistic origins. It was also an abstract ideal of a racial élite. The Aryan, or \\"noble\\" race was always changing as superior peoples supplanted inferior ones in evolutionary struggles for survival. Building somewhat on the theories of de Gobineau and Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), Chamberlain developed a relatively complex theory relating racial origins, physical features and cultural traits. According to Chamberlain, the modern Jew (Homo judaeica) mixes some of the features of the Hittite (H. syriaca) – notably the \\"Jewish nose\\", retreating chin, great cunning and fondness for usury – and of the true Semite, the Bedouin Arab (H. arabicus), in particular the dolichocephalic (long and narrow) skull, the thick-set body, and a tendency to be anti-intellectual and destructive. According to this theory, the product of this miscegenation was compromised by the great differences between these two stocks: Chamberlain also considered the Berbers from North Africa as belonging to the Aryan race. Chamberlain (who had graduate training in biology) rejected Darwinism, evolution and social Darwinism and instead emphasized \\"gestalt\\", which (he said) derived from Goethe. Chamberlain regarded Darwinism as the most abominable and misguided doctrine of the day.See Anne Harrington, Reenchanted Science: Holism in German Culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler, (Princeton University Press: 1999) online p. 106 Chamberlain used an old biblical notion of the ethnic makeup of Galilee to argue that while Jesus may have been Jewish by religion, he was probably not Jewish by race, claiming that he descended from the Amorites. and the Jews Hans Jonas, reply by Robert Craft, New York Review of Books, 16 April 1981 During the inter-war period, certain pro-Nazi theologians developed these ideas as part of the manufacture of an Aryan Jesus. Chamberlain's admirer Adolf Hitler held a similar view, as evidenced in his table talk, where he canvassed the idea of Jesus as the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier stationed in Galilee. ==Reception== The Foundations sold extensively: eight editions and 60,000 copies within ten years, 100,000 copies by the outbreak of World War I and 24 editions and more than a quarter of a million copies by 1938.William L. Shirer The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, 1959, p.107 of 1985 Bookclub Associates Edition. The Russian translation was especially popular and was carried by White Russians all the way to Siberia. The 1911 translation received positive reviews in most of the British press. It was praised in The Spectator as \\"a monument of erudition\\"; the Birmingham Post said that it was \\"glowing with life, packed with fresh and vigorous thought\\"; the Glasgow Herald thought that it would be difficult to \\"over-estimate the stimulating qualities of the book.\\" In the Times Literary Supplement it was declared to be \\"one of the books that really mattered\\". In the left-wing Fabian News George Bernard Shaw called it a \\"historical masterpiece\\". Those who failed to read it, he continued, would be unable to talk intelligently about contemporary sociological and political problems. In the U.S., Theodore Roosevelt, altogether more cautious, highlighted the extreme bias of the author, a judgement that seems to have escaped other contemporary readers, but said that Chamberlain \\"represents an influence to be reckoned with and seriously to be taken into account.\\"Theodore Roosevelt \\"History as Literature\\", 1913, http://www.bartleby.com/56/8.html The book was important to Wilhelm II, who became Chamberlain's friend (the two held a correspondence), and as a \\"spiritual\\" foundation of the Third Reich. Chamberlain's ideas on race were greatly influential to Adolf Hitler, who readily adapted them into his Nazi ideology; Chamberlain himself joined the Nazi party, and both Hitler and Goebbels visited Chamberlain whilst he was on his deathbed. ==Publishing history== The U.S. Library of Congress owns and lists six distinct editions or imprints of this text for the following years: 1911, 1912, 1913 (two), 1968, and 2005. ==See also== * Antisemitism * Kirchenkampf * The Myth of the Twentieth Century * Positive Christianity * Race of Jesus * Collective Aryan unconscious * Adolf Hitler's religious views ==Notes== ==External links== *English Text *Text in English translation *Theodore Roosevelt's review of The Foundation of the 19th Century Category:Scientific racism Category:1899 books Category:Antisemitic publications Category:Right-wing antisemitism ","title":"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century"},{"id":"9080091","text":"Walter Fitzgerald Bond (18 May 1896 – 20 December 1976) was an English character actor. ==Early life== Born in Stoke, Plymouth,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and- wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=walter%20f&lastname;=bond&eventyear;=1896&eventyear;_offset=0&county;=devon Fitzgerland was a former stockbroker before he began his theatrical training at RADA. ==Career== Fitzgerald made his professional stage bow in 1922 and his first film appearance in 1930.

Initially dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid-2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being renovated - this was the area at which Roman influence over Pompeii increased and so Roman Jupiter superseded the Greek Apollo as the town's highest god. Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome, where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state. Temple plan As the most important divinity in Ancient Rome, many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad (consisting of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly conquered by the Romans. This held true for Pompeii, where the previously existing Temple of Jupiter was enlarged and Romanized upon conquest. Pompeii was occupied by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It maintained much of its autonomy, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC. In 89, the town was besieged by Sulla. Roman language, culture, and law would soon come to dominate the city. The architecture of the town had been largely changed by the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to alterations in this style. In contrast to the previous Samnite occupiers, the Romans very much believed in the importance of architecture in religious and civic life. Pompeii was transformed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would come to dominate the city. The temple structure was built in 150 BC to dominate the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after the Roman conquest. Pure Italic style characterized the capitolium structure, which sat atop a base measuring 121 x 56 x 10 feet. The interior of the temple contained the cella, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were permitted to enter. There was a chamber below the main hall which was used to store sacrificial offerings and the treasury of the city. In 62 A.D., an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main seat of worship to Jupiter and the Capitoline Triad. The original Temple of Jupiter was still awaiting restoration when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii in volcanic dust, ash, and pumice stones. The excavated temple can still be seen in Pompeii today. This was a place where people would come to pray to the god Jupiter which later on became the name of a planet. == References == *“Jupiter.” Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. Matthew Bunson.

Carol, Lady Kidu was the only female Member of Parliament in the 2002-2007 and 2007-2012 national Parliaments, and served as Minister for Community Development under Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare from 2002 until 2 August 2011, and as Opposition Leader from 15 February 2012 until her retirement from politics in July 2012. She was the leader of the Melanesian Alliance Party until her retirement. Born in Shorncliffe, Queensland, Australia, she relocated to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea after marrying Buri Kidu, who was knighted in 1980 upon his appointment as the first indigenous Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea. Lady Kidu became a teacher and wrote school textbooks. In 1994 after her husband died of a heart attack. ==Political career== Lady Kidu entered politics in 1997, standing as an independent candidate in the parliamentary elections, and was elected Member of Parliament for the Port Moresby South constituency. She was re-elected in 2002 and 2007. In 2005, she was reportedly considered for the position of Deputy Prime Minister, but stated that she would not be interested in it. In August 2011, the government of Acting Prime Minister Sam Abal (standing in for Somare while the latter was hospitalised for a serious heart condition) was brought down by a parliamentary motion, and Dame Carol lost office.\\"O'Neill is PM\\", The National, 3 August 2011Cabinet of Papua New Guinea , CIA Factbook, 18 August 2011; accessed 10 August 2014. In January 2012, Dame Carol, a long-serving minister in the Somare government, distanced herself from those involved in attempts to overthrow current Prime Minister Peter O'Neill’s government but stated that Somare's removal from power in August 2011 was illegal. At the same time, she announced her intention to sit as the opposition leader in parliament, in order to hold the Peter O'Neill-led government to account. Dame Carol proposed forming a one-woman opposition and, in the absence of other contenders, to be recognised as opposition leader. Somare's party refused to take up opposition seats so as not to concede the legitimacy of the Peter O'Neill government. On 15 February, Speaker Jeffrey Nape recognised her as leader of the Opposition, of which she was the only sitting member. She is the first woman to occupy that position. She stated she would use her remaining time in Parliament to consolidate the role of the Opposition for the future, hoping to obtain parliamentary staff for the Opposition, and a change in parliamentary procedures to strengthen it.\\"Qld-born woman new PNG opposition leader\\", AAP, 15 February 2012; accessed 10 August 2014.

Questioning the judgment of the Speaker, Dame Carol has also called for a legislative reform that would require that the speaker be non-partisan and cannot be a serving MP. The Speaker accused her of contempt and targeted her for investigation. Dame Carol chose not to re- contest her seat of Moresby-South in the 2012 National Elections and retired from politics at the end of her third term in July 2012.

It was used by many prestigious Universities and research facilities to test for presence and quantity of amino acids in biological samples. At that time, Durrum was located on Fabian Way, Palo Alto, California, which was the birthplace of many high-tech companies. The D-500 operates using ion exchange chromatography. == Operation == A sample is first rendered into liquid form by a technician. A small amount of this liquid (typically of the order of tens of microliters) is then injected into a holder filled with super-fine resin beads made by Diamond Shamrock; the holder is then manually inserted into the analyzer. The D-500 is controlled by a PDP-8 computer which controls an electrical pump with a piston made of synthetic ruby to facilitate a very precise flow of hydraulic fluid to drive a mechanical ram assembly - this assembly has eight syringes, four on each side, each filled with a different pH liquid buffer. The buffer solutions were then washed across the sample holder and into another resin bead filled tube which had an inside diameter of the order of fifty micrometres (about the diameter of a human hair). The PDP-8 is also used to control the temperature of the separation tube. Since different amino acids have different molecular weights and sizes, they are washed through the separation tube at different speeds. At the bottom end of the separation tube, the effluent is mixed with ninhydrin, a chemical that changes color in the presence of amines, a component part of amino acids. A colorimeter passes a precisely controlled wavelength light through a series of lenses and the effluent to a light sensor on the other side of the fluid stream. The output of the colorimeter is then fed back to the computer for processing. The output consists of a printout to the teletype and a graph drawn by a pen and ink recorder. Once the process is complete, the computer determines the time and the percentage of each amino acid present as they exited the separation tube. Since different molecules pass through the resin tube at various speeds, graphing the output of the colorimeter against time indicates which amino acid is present. The amount of light passing through the colorimeter determines the percentage of change from the base line, the latter being set during calibration. == Calibration == Each separation tube had to be installed by a factory-trained technician, and recalibration required days of testing and calculating baselines. Once calibrated, the results of the analysis can be affected by: # the volume of buffer flow (which changes the separation times between various amino acids - controlled by the speed of the ruby-piston pump); flow is also affected by the inside diameter of the tube, the size of the resin beads, and how tightly they are packed inside the tube. # the size of the sample (controlled by the technician preparing the sample) # the temperature of the resin-bead tubetoo high and the sample will be destroyed, too low and the sample will not separate # the volume of ninhydrin added to the effluent # the pH of the buffer being used to wash the sample through the resin-beads All these factors require careful control and monitoring. === Minor Design Issues === * The original design used a calcium citrate washing buffer. * When Lamont-Doherty Labs began testing amino acids from shells, residue from the samples, when heated, became chalk, which clogged the tubing. Changing to lithium citrate eliminated this problem. == Notes == == References == * *Oxidative Modification of Glutamine Synthetase Category:Laboratory equipment ","title":"Durrum D-500"},{"id":"9080236","text":"Grundy's Wonders is a Tyne Tees Television architecture programme presented by John Grundy, which began in 2000.

In the 1970s some proponents of this movement suggested that if one was not healed supernaturally by God that one did not have 'enough faith' or was 'in sin'. He complemented this perspective and refreshed the charismatic movement by pointing back to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God. Dr. Charles Farah, Jr. is best known for discipling world- wide leaders, such as Billy Joe Daugherty (Victory Christian Center), Jamie Buckingham (charismatic preacher and author), Terry Law (World Compassion founder), Larry Stockstill (Bethany World Prayer Center in Louisiana), and Keith Green (singer and songwriter).

He received his early Hebrew education in the cheider and from his father, Shebaḥ ha-Levi, a noted preacher, who instructed him in mathematics and German language also. ==Early years== In his youth Pinsker was an enthusiastic admirer of the Ḥasidim, but soon forsook them. He at first engaged in business, but, having no aptitude therefor, was obliged to abandon it. He then went to Odessa, and, owing to his calligraphic skill, became secretary to the rabbi. Here, in conjunction with Isaac Horowitz of Brody and Littenfeld, Pinsker succeeded in establishing a public school for Jewish children, of which he himself served as principal until 1840. ==Research== At that time Abraham Firkovich, a Karaite scholar, brought to Odessa a number of ancient manuscripts, unearthed in the Crimea. Among these was one of the Later Prophets which had a singular punctuation, differing widely in the form of the vowels and singing-accents from the one then in use. This manuscript gave ample opportunity to Pinsker to satisfy his propensity for research. He at once set himself to the task of deciphering the system of punctuation, and satisfactorily accomplished it. He had already become known as an archaeologist of merit through his contributions to the Orient, but with this discovery his fame was established. He was thereupon honored by the Russian government with two gold medals and with the title \\"Honorable Citizen\\", and the community of Odessa bestowed upon him a life-pension of 300 rubles a year. ===Likkute Kadmoniyyot (ליקוטי קדמוניות)=== Pinsker then retired from communal work, and repaired to Vienna in order to devote the rest of his life to his researches and to the arrangement and publication of his works. Of these the first and most important one was Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot (Vienna, 1860), in which he describes the different periods of development in the history of Karaism. He maintains that the term \\"Karaite\\" is derived from the Hebrew \\"ḳara\\" (קרא) = \\"to call,\\" \\"to invite,\\" and that its use dates from the first period of the schism, when the members of this sect sent messengers throughout Jewry \\"to invite\\" the people to join their ranks (Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot, p. 16). Pinsker moreover attempts to show throughout the whole work that to the scholars of this sect who preceded the orthodox Biblical scholars and grammarians is due the correct system of Biblical orthography, grammar, and lexicography; and that even in their poetry the Karaites were models for the Hebrew poets of the Middle Ages, such as Ibn Gabirol and Judah ha-Levi. (ib. p. 107). The Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot made such an impression upon the scholarly world that Jost and H. Graetz publicly avowed their indebtedness to the author, the former even changing, in consequence, some of the views expressed in his history of the Jewish sects. ===Mabo el ha-Nikkud ha-Ashshuri veha-Babli=== The other great work of Pinsker, published in his lifetime, was Mabo el ha-Niḳḳud ha-Ashshuri weha-Babli (Vienna, 1863), an introduction to the Babylonian-Hebraic system of punctuation; it contains the results of his examination of the manuscripts in the Odessa library. As an appendix to it is printed the Yesod Mispar, by Abraham ibn Ezra, on the Hebrew numerals. ===Other works=== Pinsker's other works are: * an edition of the Miklol (Lyck, 1862), Hebrew grammar by D. Ḳimḥi, with emendations by Pinsker and others *Sefer ha-Eḥad (Odessa, 1867), on the nine cardinal numbers, by Abraham ibn Ezra, with commentary *Mishle ha- Gezerah weha-Binyan (Vienna, 1887), on the Hebrew verb. Pinsker left, besides, a considerable number of manuscripts on the Hebrew language and literature. At Vienna, Pinsker lectured for some time at the bet ha-midrash; but, his health soon failing, he was brought back by his children to Odessa, where he died on October 29, 1864. ==Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography== *Zederbaum, in Miẓpah, iv. 13–14; *idem, in Ha-Meliẓ, 1864, No. 42; *Ha-Maggid, 1865, Nos. 7-10; *Monatsschrift, x. 176 et seq.; *He-Ḥaluẓ, v. 56 et seq.; *Mazkir li-Bene Reshef, in Ha-Shahar, i. 46 et seq.; *H.

Laguna Miñiques lies on its northwestern foot; it was separated from Laguna Miscanti by a lava flow from Miñiques. The mountain rises from a high ignimbrite plateau. It is of Pleistocene age and formed by andesitic and dacitic rocks; the volcano is classified as extinct, but activity of the Pliocene-Pleistocene volcano may have continued into the Holocene.

The sink is actually a large fan housed in a chimney-like structure, and works by defeating surface temperature inversion. Cold air is denser than warm air, and will pool at ground level during calm weather. This lowers the surface temperature, even if the ambient temperature is higher. Vents near the base of the chimney allow cold surface air to be pulled up through the chimney, creating a suction effect that draws warmer air down to surface level. The SIS is more efficient than typical ground-heaters, and is widely used to combat frost. ==References== *To blow up or down?

Non-comparative sorting algorithms such as radix sort and American flag sort are typically used to sort large objects such as strings, for which comparison is not a unit-time operation. American flag sort iterates through the bits of the objects, considering several bits of each object at a time. For each set of bits, American flag sort makes two passes through the array of objects: first to count the number of objects that will fall in each bin, and second to place each object in its bucket. This works especially well when sorting a byte at a time, using 256 buckets. With some optimizations, it is twice as fast as quicksort for large sets of strings. The name American flag sort comes by analogy with the Dutch national flag problem in the last step: efficiently partition the array into many \\"stripes\\". == Algorithm == Sorting algorithms in general sort a list of objects according to some ordering scheme. In contrast to comparison-based sorting algorithms, such as quicksort, American flag sort can only sort integers (or objects that can be interpreted as integers). In-place sorting algorithms, including American flag sort, run without allocating a significant amount of memory beyond that used by the original array. This is a significant advantage, both in memory savings and in time saved copying the array. American flag sort works by successively dividing a list of objects into buckets based on the first digit of their base-N representation (the base used is referred to as the radix). When N is 3, each object can be swapped into the correct bucket by using the Dutch national flag algorithm. When N is larger, however, objects cannot be immediately swapped into place, because it is unknown where each bucket should begin and end. American flag sort gets around this problem by making two passes through the array. The first pass counts the number of objects that belong in each of the N buckets. The beginning of each bucket is then computed as the sum of sizes of the preceding buckets. The second pass puts each object into the correct bucket. American flag sort is most efficient with a radix that is a power of 2, because bit-shifting operations can be used instead of expensive exponentiations to compute the value of each digit. When sorting strings using 8- or 7-bit encodings such as ASCII, it is typical to use a radix of 256 or 128, which amounts to sorting character-by-character. === Performance considerations === It is worth noting that for pure English alphabet text, the counts histogram is always sparse. Depending on the hardware, it may be worth clearing the counts in correspondence with completing a bucket (as in the original paper.) Or it may be worth maintaining a max and min active bucket, or a more complex data structure suitable for sparse arrays. It is also important to use a more basic sorting method for very small data sets, except in pathological cases where keys may share very long prefixes. Most critically, this algorithm follows a random permutation, and is thus particularly cache-unfriendly for large datasets. It is a suitable algorithm in conjunction with a k-way merge algorithm. (The original paper was written before cached memory was in common use.) === Pseudocode === american_flag_sort(Array, Radix) for each digit D: # first pass: compute counts Counts <- zeros(Radix) for object X in Array: Counts[digit D of object X in base Radix] += 1 # compute bucket offsets Offsets <- [ sum(Counts[0..i]) for i in 1..Radix] # swap objects into place for object X in Array: swap X to the bucket starting at Offsets[digit D of X in base Radix] for each Bucket: american_flag_sort(Bucket, Radix) === Sample implementation in Python === This example written in the Python programming language will perform American flag sort for any radix of 2 or greater.

The loop runs through the communities of Linthicum, Ferndale, and Hanover. Airport Loop consists of a section of Maryland Route 170 (MD 170) along the western and northern sides of the loop; the entire length of MD 162 on the eastern side of the loop; and a segment of MD 176 on the southern side of the loop. Airport Loop intersects Interstate 195 (I-195), which provides freeway access to the airport terminal, and is connected to I-695, I-97, and MD 100 via connecting highways. The MD 170 and MD 162 sections of Airport Loop are part of the National Highway System. ==Route description== MD 170 northbound along the Airport Loop in Linthicum Airport Loop begins at I-195/MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard) signed as part of MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard). Airport Loop meets the Interstate highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange at the northwest corner of the loop. I-195 heads south to the airport terminal and north toward MD 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway) and I-95, which connect BWI Airport with Baltimore and Washington. Airport Loop passes under the BWI Trail and heads east as a four-lane divided highway. At the next intersection, the loop meets Elm Road, which heads south toward the airport terminal and hourly, daily, and express parking lots, and north toward Elkridge Landing Road, which passes through the BWI Hotel District and leads to off-site parking. Immediately east of the intersection, Airport Loop crosses at-grade MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. The loop passes to the south of the BWI Business District station, whose kiss-and-ride and park-and-ride facilities can be accessed via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. The air cargo facility is also accessed from that intersection. Airport Loop continues east, paralleling the light rail until the first route change occurs where MD 170 leaves the loop to the north as Camp Meade Road toward I-695 and the loop continues east as MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard). Airport Loop passes the entrance to both long-term parking lots before intersecting Andover Road, which is unsigned MD 762 and connects with MD 170 in Linthicum. At this point, the loop turns south and is flanked by residential subdivisions to the east and the BWI Trail on the west. The next intersection features Ferndale Road heading east and the entrance to BWI Airport's general aviation facility. Airport Loop passes the offices of the Maryland Aviation Administration before reaching Cromwell Drive, which serves an industrial park and leads to ramps to and from southbound I-97. Airport Loop continues south to an intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) and Stewart Avenue. MD 176 east leads to an interchange with access to northbound I-97. Airport Loop turns west onto westbound MD 176. Airport Loop heads west as a four-lane divided highway that reduces to a four- lane undivided highway with intermittent center turn lane as the highway passes the aircraft observation park, where the BWI Trail again parallels the loop. The loop passes the overflow parking facility on the north as it passes an industrial park on the south before reaching MD 652 (Old Telegraph Road). A long ramp for northbound MD 170, designated MD 170A, exits westbound MD 176 before MD 176 intersects MD 170, which heads south as Telegraph Road toward an interchange with MD 100 and north as Aviation Boulevard. Airport Loop turns north onto MD 170. Airport Loop heads north as a four-lane undivided highway paralleled by the BWI Trail on the east and the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the west through the trees. The loop intersects Stoney Run Road, which provides access to multiple rental car facilities and a business park. Stoney Run Road heads east then loops around to cross over Airport Loop; this is where the BWI Trail switches to the west side of the highway. At the intersection with Amtrak Way, which is unsigned MD 995 and leads to the BWI Rail Station serving Amtrak and MARC's Penn Line, the BWI Trail splits to the north to follow Amtrak Way as Airport Loop curves to the northeast. Airport Loop completes its circuit of BWI Airport at the interchange with I-195. ==Junction list== Airport Loop runs clockwise around BWI Airport. For purposes of this list, mile 0 is located at the I-195 interchange. ==BWI Trail== The non-motorized companion to the Airport Loop is the BWI Trail, a http://bikewashington.org/routes/bwi/ hiking and bicycling trail that completely encircles BWI Airport. Also constructed by MDSHA and designed for area commuters, the first section of the trail opened in July 1994 and the main loop was eventually completed in 1999. Described as a \\"linear park\\" circling BWI airport, the trail is believed to be the only one of its type in the entire United States. The BWI Trail connects directly to the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail via the John Overstreet Connector; through this spur, the trail continues the mileage of the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail, increasing counterclockwise around the loop. A trailhead is located at the Thomas A. Dixon, Jr. Aircraft Observation Area, located at the south side of the Airport Loop east of WB&A; Road. The trail itself is mostly flat, although the northern segment of the loop has several grades over 6%. The BWI Trail is a part of the East Coast Greenway. The trail has multiple spurs, all marked as part of the \\"BWI Trail\\", aside from the main circle which generally follows the Airport Loop. Beginning from the Dixon Observation Area and going counterclockwise: * The John Overstreet Connector is the link between the BWI Trail and the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail. It intersects the BWI Trail loop at the intersection of Stewart Avenue and Newport Road, at the BWI Trail's closest approach to I-97. The trail spur follows the street for a short distance across I-97, then turns northeast on its own alignment, passing through Sawmill Creek Park before it connects seamlessly to the northern terminus of the B-A Trail. The John Overstreet Connector is the aforementioned direct extension of the B&A; Trail's mileage. * One begins from the BWI Trail loop at South Hammonds Ferry Road and goes northward, paralleling Hammonds Ferry Road and then the Baltimore Light Rail's right-of-way shortly after for a short distance. It then passes by Linthicum Station, currently ending at Maple Road. This spur is planned to extend further north alongside the Baltimore Light Rail; a $300,000 grant for design of this extension as far north as the Nursery Road Light Rail station was approved in 2012. * Just beyond Hammonds Ferry, a third spur runs along Andover Road after the BWI Trail mainline turns south to circumnavigate the airport. It runs westward alongside Andover Park, stopping at Main Avenue. * A fourth spur branches from the main loop east of the bridge over I-195, bound for the airport terminal. It passes over the Airport Loop on another bridge and runs along the inbound side of Terminal Road, ending at the entrance to the BWI Express Parking Lot. * At Amtrak Way, another spur branches from the Trail and heads north along with the road to access BWI Rail Station. A trail continues beyond here, across the Northeast Corridor, on an elevated boardwalk over Stony Run to access Corporate Center Drive. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Maryland 170 *BWI Airport: The BWI Trail *Good map of the BWI Trail *\\"The BWI Trail\\" Maryland Department of Natural Resources Category:Roads in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Loop ","title":"Airport Loop"},{"id":"9080748","text":"Sardar Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Nasar (; born January 10, 1947 in Quetta) is a Pakistani politician and current Member of the Senate of Pakistan. He was the Interim president of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) in 2017. He succeeded Nawaz Sharif after his disqualification by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. He has served as member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from the Loralai constituency and the Provincial President (Balochistan) and Central Vice President of PML (N). He is the chief of the pashtun Nasar tribe, who have many members in Pakistan and he commands a strong influence and respect in his native province of Balochistan. Sardar Muhammad Yaqoob Khan Nasar has been returning to Parliament regularly since his first electoral win in 1985. He is a close aide of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. He served as a member of Balochistan Provincial Assembly and as Provincial Minister for Irrigation, Development and Public Health from 1985 to 1988, as member of National Assembly and Federal Minister for Environment, Afghan Refugees, State and Frontier Region from 1990 to 1993 and as Senator from 1995 to 1999. He was elected to the National Assembly again in 1997 and served as Minister for Railways from 1997 to 1999. ==Personal life== Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan Nasar graduated from the University of the Punjab in 1969 and obtained a Masters in Political Science from the University of Balochistan in 1983.

He is married and has four sons and six daughters. ==Loss as a result of election rigging== In the February 18, 2008 elections held in Pakistan, Mr. Nasar lost the election from Loralai District where allegations of massive rigging were made by independent election observers. It is noteworthy to mention that he lost to a candidate Sardar Israr Tareen, from the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) which was being supported at the time by then President Pervez Musharraf's Government. There were approximately 35000 unregistered votes cast against Mr. Nasar in that election by Pervez Musharraf's provincial government of the time. After a lengthy Court battle, Baluchistan High Court ordered a recount and directed the Election Commission of Pakistan http://www2.ecp.gov.pk/vsite/complete/Search.aspx?constituency=NA&constituencyid;=NA-263 to reverse the original decision and declare Sardar Nasar as winner, but the rival candidate Sardar Israr Tareen remained as a member of Parliament from 2008 to 2011 due to practical difficulties of this unique case. The rival candidate Sardar Israr Tareen has again returned to the national assembly after winning the case on 14 May 2012. ==See also== *Pakistan Muslim League (N) *Loralai District ==References== ==External links== *Pakistan Muslim League Pakistan Muslim League Leadership *Election Pakistan article: Tough fight on two more NA seats in Balochistan *ECP original decision *ECP declares Sardar Yaqoob Khan as winner Category:Balochistan MPAs 1985–1988 Category:Pakistani MNAs 1997–1999 Category:Pakistan Muslim League (N) politicians Category:Pashtun people Category:People from Loralai District Category:Politicians from Quetta Category:University of Balochistan alumni Category:University of the Punjab alumni Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:Pakistani MNAs 1990–1993 Category:Pakistani senators (14th Parliament) Category:Presidents of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) ","title":"Sardar Yaqoob Nasar"},{"id":"9080778","text":"The Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA) was founded in 1999 by Jewish Angelenos who broke away from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Jewish Congress.

It was published in 2006 by Firefly Books, and written by Tim Haines with Paul Chambers. It accompanies all of the main programs in the Walking with... series, including specials The Ballad of Big Al, Chased by Dinosaurs and Sea Monsters, but excluding Walking with Cavemen and spin-off Prehistoric Park. ==Contents== The book opens with an introduction by the authors reflecting on the making of the TV series. The book is then divided into three parts by era, first of which is The Rise of Life, which covers the Precambrian and the Paleozoic Era. The second part, The Age of Reptiles, covers the Mesozoic Era. The third and final part, The Age of Beasts, covers the Cenozoic Era. The book concludes with a timescale of life on earth, tree of life diagrams. == Reception == Stuart Sumida, writing in the The Quarterly Review of Biology, stated that \\"The authors make a valiant attempt to clear locality and phylogenetic perspectives, but it is a mixed bag. They are properly up to date on the theropod origin of feathers and birds, yet they are a quarter century behind on mammalian ancestors, still calling them mammal-like reptiles as opposed to Synapsida.\\" He also noted that \\"a survey of colleagues generated a list of errors in virtually every section of the book\\" but concluded that the book is \\"a visual tour de force, confirming that computer generated (CG)-based reconstructions have justifiably joined the more traditional disciplines of sculpture, drawing, and painting in paleobiological art. In the end, it is visually impressive, but its textual potential remains unrealized.\\" Joanna K. Kowalewska and Michał Kowalewski writing in Palaeontologia Electronica found that \\"The compendium’s encyclopedic scope makes the guide necessarily akin to a cookbook. That is, you don’t read it for its plot. But, as with all successful encyclopedic renderings, its value resides in its detailed, beautifully illustrated, and lucidly organized descriptions. In this case, descriptions pertain to the most exciting topic of all: the fossils.\\" They conclude, \\"All in all, The Complete Guide to Prehistoric Life is a great encyclopedic compendium, especially for those who are interested in spectacular fossils or happen to have pre-college family members. The book also has a potential to evolve into a valuable teaching reference for K-12 educators, who develop courses that include aspects of paleontology and evolution.\\" == References == Category:2006 non- fiction books Category:Dinosaur books Category:Paleontology books Category:Encyclopedias of science Category:Walking with...

Cymbal manufacturing is a difficult field to succeed in: most companies that are still around today have hundreds of years of smithing and crafting experience in their past. == \\"The Big Four\\": Major cymbal manufacturers == In the modern world, there are four primary cymbal manufacturers that together encompass over half of all cymbal sales. * Meinl Percussion * Paiste * Sabian * Zildjian == Other cymbal manufacturers == Aside from the four major contenders in the cymbal world, there are many more companies, especially in Turkey, where some have common roots in the old Istanbul based Zildjian factory. Many of today's cymbal manufacturers have established themselves through unique manufacturing techniques, unusual sound qualities, competitive pricing, place or style of manufacturing, or cymbal material. Other notable cymbal companies are: * Crescent * Hammerax * Istanbul Agop * Stagg * Soultone Cymbals * UFIP Other minor brands and individual cymbal makers make their own cymbals or rework existing cymbals. ==Notable past cymbal manufacturers/smiths== Bellotti cymbal with typical hammered pattern === Bellotti Cymbals === A stamp from a 1950s-era Bellotti Cymbal Bellotti was a small Italian cymbal workshop that produced cymbals from the 1950s until the 1970s.Pinksterboer, Hugo: The Cymbal Book. Hal Leonard Publishers. 1992 Because so few of these vintage cymbals exist on the market today (they are much less prevalent that some other vintage Italian contemporaries, such as Zanchi), Bellotti remains one of the more obscure names in cymbal manufacturers. Most Bellottis are relatively small 12\\"-15\\", and quite heavy. Their craftsmanship displays a fine lathing on top and bottom and very broad, circular-peen hand-hammering. The cast bronze cymbals are of a B20 alloy. The bellholes of most Bellottis are of small aperture, which suggests a fabrication date prior to the 1960s.Salgado, J. \\"Vintage Cymbals, an Identification Guide\\", \\"Not So Modern Drummer\\", vol. 12, #6 Very finely crafted, most existing examples are likely to have been hand or field cymbals, due both to their weight and diameters. The tell-tale insignia is an embossed stamp on the underside of the cymbal. There are two versions of this stamp. The first simply reads \\"Bellotti\\" on capital block letters. The second version also reads \\"Bellotti,\\" but also incorporates the logo of a bell. Often, Bellottis have embossing that reads \\"Italy\\" or \\"Made in Italy\\" in a semicircular pattern. This embossing appears on other Italian cymbals of the 1940s-1960s. ===Roberto Spizzichino=== 22\\" Spizzichino ride Roberto Spizzichino (1944–2011) was an Italian jazz drummer and renowned master cymbalsmith. Spizzichino lathed and hand-hammered cymbals in his workshop in San Quirico, Tuscany in the tradition of the K Zildjian cymbal makers from Istanbul. Early in his career, Spizzichino worked for the Italian cymbal company UFIP, providing cymbal development and research. In 1986, after leaving UFIP, Spizzichino started experimenting with his own \\"Spizz\\" brand cymbals. Spizzichino also worked for Bespeco, an Italian musical equipment manufacturer. Bespeco still offers a line of machine-made B8 Spizz brand cymbals produced according to a process developed by Spizzichino. The Chinese cymbal manufacturer, Wuhan, also produced a limited number of its own Spizz brand cymbals during a brief collaboration in 1989 when Spizzichino visited the factory. He was in China to find a source for B20 blanks. Spizzichino was involved in the Wuhan/Spizz cymbals' design but was not involved with the cymbal production and distribution. He was not satisfied with the product and did not wish to be associated with it. Neither the Bespeco Spizz or the Wuhan/Spizz cymbals were endorsed by Spizzichino. Recent Spizzichino brand cymbals are crafted from high quality B20 bell bronze discs sourced from Turkey. The first Spizzichinos were made from inexpensive, heavy B20 blanks imported from China. By heating, hand-hammering and lathing the material, Spizzichino sought to bring out desirable sound characteristics often lacking in machine-made modern cymbals. Spizzichino became unsatisfied with the purity of the Chinese material after a couple years, and found a different supplier. Roberto Spizzichino's cymbals are coveted by jazz drummers seeking the 'old K sound' and are considered rare and collectable, as he made fewer than 3,500 cymbals during his career. Spizzichino died on November 22, 2011. ===Zyn, Super Zyn & 5 Star Super Zyn=== Zyn cymbals were introduced by Premier Percussion in 1950. They were marketed as an affordable instrument, with a priority of functionality over musical quality. They were made of nickel- silver alloy and could be purchased with Premier's Olympic-series drum kits. Pairs of concert cymbals were available for marching bands and orchestra. The professional-grade Super Zyn range followed in 1951, realised in B20 alloy. According to Cymbals Today (a contemporary promotional material published by Premier), these instruments were endorsed by a number of professional jazz drummers, such as Ray Ellington and Eric Delaney. Sizes were 12 inches through 24 inches, in thin, medium-thin, medium or heavy weights. Concert cymbals were available in 14, 15 and 16 inch pairs. The 5 Star Super Zyn range was announced in 1968, replacing the Super Zyn as Premier's professional-grade cymbal. Like their predecessors, these cymbals were also made of B20 alloy. However, their build was thicker and heavier - similar to the heavy-weight Super Zyns - reflecting contemporary trends in popular music, where denser cymbals were required to meet the increasing volume of amplified instruments in popular music. The range began with a 12-inch cymbal, while hi-hats could be specified in 13, 14 or 15 inch pairs. 16, 18, 20 and 22 inch cymbals were all available as a ride, crash, or crash-ride. Sizzle cymbals (factory-fitted with rivets), could be ordered in 18 and 20 inch sizes. Concert cymbals were available in 14, 15 and 16 inch pairs. There was also a budget alternative to the 5 Star Super Zyn, called the 2 Star Super Zyn. The naming system was a reference to the contemporary octane rating system for leaded petrol in the UK. Premier also marketed a Zyn 70. Production of all Zyn types concluded in 1984, replaced by Premier's then-expanding distribution and promotion of Zildjian cymbals. However, the name has since been revived on two occasions, first in the late 1990s with a German-made Zyn. All previous Zyn cymbals featured stamped logos but the Made in Germany Zyn title was stencilled in capital letters. The range consisted of just four cymbal types: pairs of 14 inch hi-hats, 20 inch Medium Ride, plus 16 and 18 inch Crash cymbals. Unlike previous Zyns, there were no concert cymbals or Super Zyn variants marketed on this occasion. The second and final reintroduction was announced by Premier in 2006: the new Zyn was machine-hammered B20 alloy, while the new Super Zyn was combination hand- and machine-hammered B20 alloy. Both types were made in China and can be identified by their stencilled nametag (distinct from the stencilling of the German-made Zyn range). As with past Zyns, pairs of concert cymbals were also available. Unfortunately, the revival was commercially unsuccessful and the cymbals were only produced for a short period of time. ==See also== * List of drum manufacturers * List of timpani manufacturers ==References== Category:Lists of manufacturers ","title":"Cymbal manufacturers"},{"id":"9080882","text":"A house in Brigdamme Brigdamme is a former hamlet and municipality in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

Covidien became an independent publicly traded company after being spun-off from Tyco International in 2007. It was purchased by Medtronic in a transaction that closed in 2015. The now merged company is headquartered in Ireland, where Covidien was based. ==History== Though formed as Covidien in 2007, Covidien traces its roots to 1903 when Henry P. Kendall took over a small textile mill in Walpole, Massachusetts, United States, that produced cotton batts, carpet linings and absorbent cotton. The company later developed health and hygienic products. A number of other medical device companies eventually came together with the Kendall Company to form the foundation for Covidien. By 1994, Kendall had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of disposable medical supplies, wound care dressings, bandaging, elastic support and other vascular compression products. It became the basis of the Tyco Healthcare business when it was acquired by the company that year, along with Classic Medical, Uni- Patch and Promeon. In 1998, Tyco Healthcare acquired Sherwood, Davis & Geck, a manufacturer and distributor of disposable medical products, and United States Surgical Corporation (U.S. Surgical), which provided suture and auto suture devices, along with energy-based devices, through its Valleylab brand. And, in 2000, Tyco Healthcare added respiratory and monitoring products provider Nellcor Puritan Bennett through the acquisition of Mallinckrodt Inc. In 2007, Covidien was formed when Tyco International spun off its health care business. Since that time, Covidien has made a number of acquisitions including VNUS Medical Technologies, Aspect Medical Systems, Somanetics, ev3, BÂRRX, Newport Medical Instruments, superDimension, Oridion Systems and Given Imaging. Offshoring and focus on Low Cost Countries (LCC) resulted in several plant closures in the USA particularly a few in upper New York state and Norwood, Massachusetts. In 2011, José E. Almeida became the Chairman, CEO, and President. In 2012, Covidien acquired Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer supplier. Newport Medical Instruments had been contracted in 2006 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to design a cheap, portable ventilator. At the time, Newport Medical Instruments had 3 working prototypes produced, and was on schedule to file for market approval late 2013. Covidien then effectively halted the project, subsequently exiting the contract, as it was not profitable enough. Government officials and other medical equipment suppliers suspect the Newport acquisition was largely done to prevent a cheaper product from undermining Covidien's existing ventilator business. This contributed to the shortage of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2014, Covidien was operating in more than 150 countries globally, with 39,000+ employees in over 70 countries. In January 2014, Covidien acquires WEM Electronic Equipment, based in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. In June 2014, Covidien agreed to be acquired by Medtronic for $42.9 billion. ==References== == External links == * Covidien.com * Covidien Company Profile at MarketWatch * Key Statistics Category:Medtronic Category:Tyco International Category:Health care companies of Ireland Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Multinational companies Category:Defunct pharmaceutical companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Massachusetts Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 2007 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2007 Category:Corporate spin-offs Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions Category:Tax inversions ","title":"Covidien"},{"id":"9080890","text":"Hortelã is a settlement in the western part of the island of São Nicolau, Cape Verde.

He then moved to Venice, to the studio of Gregorio Lazzarini and later that of Sebastiano Ricci. His career largely overlapped with Lazzarini and Ricci's fellow pupil, Giambattista Tiepolo, who was seven years his elder. Between 1710-1720, he painted a group of eight pictures that included the Mary Magdalene for the church of Santo Stefano in Belluno, and Entry into Jerusalem for San Teodoro in Venice. He also painted three frescoes on the Life of Saint Helena in the Scuola del Vin next to the church of San Silvestro. Diziani's celerity and technical assurance are evident from preparatory oil sketches, where color has been applied in rapid and spirited strokes. He also worked as a scenery painter for the theater and opera in Venice, Munich (1717), and later in Dresden, in conjunction with Alessandro Mauro. Diziani was invited to Rome by Cardinal Ottoboni in 1726, to paint a \\"magnificent decoration for the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso\\". This work is now known only through an engraving by Claude Vasconi. The Sala dei Pastelli in Ca' Rezzonico has a sotto in su allegorical ceiling fresco of The Triumph of Poetry (Poetry surrounded by Painting, Architecture, Music and Sculpture).

It has an overall grey-blue colouration, and juveniles are duller than adults. It makes a soft purring coo sound and a deeper whoo sound comparable to a cow mooing. It lays one glossy white egg per brood, and is possibly somewhat colonial. Other than the Christmas Island flying fox, the Christmas imperial pigeon is the only fruit-eating (frugivorous) animal on the island, and the pigeon feeds and nests in the dense canopy. It mainly inhabits the tropical inland plateau, and widespread non-native Jamaican cherry forests. It was previously thought to be in danger of extinction due to habitat loss and invasive species (specifically the yellow crazy ant), but it is now considered to be rather common, with a breeding population of about 5,000. ==Taxonomy== The Christmas imperial pigeon was first described by English ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1887 based on an adult male specimen collected by Captain John Maclear of . The species name whartoni honours British admiral Sir William Wharton. It is unclear how Sharpe and Wharton are affiliated, but Wharton was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in the previous year, possibly somehow affecting Sharpe's thinking. Sharpe first classified it into the now- defunct genus Carpophaga. In 1933, English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen considered the Christmas imperial pigeon to be a subspecies of pink-headed imperial pigeon as D. rosacea whartoni. In 1937, American ornithologist James L. Peters synonymised Carpophaga with Drucula, and disagreed with Chasen, classifying the Christmas imperial pigeon as a distinct species, D. whartoni. The Christmas imperial pigeon is a species of imperial pigeon (Ducula), which is widely spread out across Oceania, however it is the only imperial pigeon in the Indian Ocean. Likewise, its affinities are unclear. However, the Christmas imperial pigeon could be placed into the D. aenea species complex along with the green (nominate), island, grey, and pink-headed imperial pigeons. The latter is sometimes considered synonymous with the Christmas imperial pigeon. ==Description== An adult Christmas imperial pigeon male measures on average , and females . In males, the wing averages , and in females . The average male weighs , and female . It is rather large for imperial pigeons, though relatively lightly built. It has an overall grey-black colour, with darker feathers on the top portion, and lighter feathers on the breast and belly with a burgundy tinge. The beak is black. There is a narrow white band on the base of the upper beak. The eye colour ranges from yellow to orange. The nape and back have a glossy oil-green colour. The wings have glossy bluish-green tips, and are greyish-brown nearer the base. The tail has broad, greenish-brown tips with a somewhat scalloped appearance, and the legs and underside of the tail have reddish-brown feathers. The feet are purple-red. Juveniles look similar to adults, but have duller colouration, without the oil-green gloss from the lower back to the tail coverts, with a brown breast and belly, a dull grey crown, and grey-brown feet. Eye colour is dark brown. The Christmas imperial pigeon is known to make a soft gurgling or purring coo sound. It can also make a deep whoo or croo-croo-croo sound which has also been compared to a cow mooing in the distance. It sometimes makes loud clapping sounds with its wings, but in flight, it is largely quiet. ==Breeding== Males have been observed to engage in a courtship display, a \\"perch coo\\". A male will slightly puff up its chest, press his bill against it, hold his wings close, and will emit a loud coo before lowering his body to an almost horizontal position. It will rhythmically repeat this motion. The Christmas imperial pigeon generally constructs nests in the dense forest canopy. One nest was observed to have been in diameter, thick, and constructed using only dead twigs off the ground in a non-native white leadtree. Peak breeding season may be from November to April. Breeding season is from at least August to April, though predominantly November to March, and the pigeon may be somewhat colonial. It lays a single egg per brood—on rare occasions two—and may lay two broods per year. One observed chick, probably 10–13 days old, was measured to be long, with developing covert and secondary feathers, and emerging primary feathers. By age 22 days, the chick resembled a small adult, except with remnants of down feathers on the breast and belly, brown feet and irises, and duller plumage. It fledged (became capable of flight) upon reaching 70% of full size at age 24–27 days, and remained dependent on parental care for 17 more days. The chick was fed over a period of 5 to 15 minutes. The chick prodded its parent's throat, and then inserted its beak for about 12 seconds, and did this twice per minutes. Feeding was observed between 9–10 A.M., but probably occurred again in the evening or nighttime. Outside of feeding, it was left alone in the nest, but may have been accompanied through the night. An egg taken in 1914 was observed to be a broad-elliptical shape, white, slightly glossy, and measured . ==Habitat== Map of Christmas Island The species is endemic to the tropical Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean. It predominantly inhabits the evergreen inland plateau, but is found throughout the island. Though about a third of this was cut down for phosphate mining, the introduced Jamaican cherry trees has recolonized many areas. It was introduced to the Coco Islands (probably Horsburgh Island) sometime between November 1888 and August 1890, with the last sighting made in 1906. ==Ecology== The Christmas Island flying fox is the only other major frugivore on the island. The Christmas imperial pigeon, along with the Christmas Island flying fox, are the only 2 major fruit-eating (frugivorous) animals on the island. As such, the pigeon plays an important role in seed dispersal, seeds swallowed whole and remaining intact (imperial pigeons are able to stretch the base of the jaw to eat larger food items.) They have been reported feeding on smaller seeded plants such as the stinkwood Celtis timorensis, the common fig, the chinaberry tree, Syzygium nervosum, Tristiropsis acutangula, and the introduced Jamaican cherry. The latter has become a very important food source, with sightings of several hundreds of pigeons where the plant is common. It generally feeds in flocks in the canopy, isolated trees, or shrubs, and descends to drink from springs or puddles. It has also been observed feeding singly or in pairs. Though frugivorous, the pigeon has been observed repeatedly consuming the leaves of the introduced papaya plant (folivory), which may have been caused by an island-wide shortage of fruit or, less likely, for some therapeutic reason. Peak foraging time appears to be just before dusk. The Christmas goshawk has been observed preying on a Christmas imperial pigeon chick. ==Conservation== The Christmas imperial pigeon is classified as near threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and is not protected by the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 because, though its moderately small population is restricted to an island, it appears to be stable with no indication of significant future decline. It is possible that the population fluctuated from the initial settlement of the island in 1888 to the 1970s, with reports of a minor decline. In 1975, ornithologist Gerard Frederick van Tets guessed the total population to be 20 to 200 birds. A 2000 survey estimated the breeding population to be 1,000, and predicted that, due to the rapid spread of the invasive yellow crazy ant, there would be an 80% decline in the pigeon's population over the next 12 years, making it critically endangered. Conversely, a 2003 survey estimated 35,000–66,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the population as 5,000 mature individuals, and the pigeon is considered to be common with no major concerns of decline. ===Threats=== Hunting was, historically, the main threat to the Christmas imperial pigeon, and the seeding of Japanese cherry trees along roadsides made it easier game, but the practice was made illegal in 1977. A 1994 survey found the diet of feral cats consisted predominantly of Christmas imperial pigeon, Christmas Island flying fox, and invasive rats. However, these were more likely scavenged than hunted. Though there is no quantitative evidence, there are anecdotal reports of yellow crazy ants attacking birds or disturbing nests. Infestations of scale insects, caused by their mutualistic relationship with the ants, has negatively impacted the canopy, and, in the long-term, could lead to decline of the habitat's health. The reduction of the Christmas Island red crab population due to the ants has led to the germination of plants which otherwise would have been eaten by the crabs, which could eventually dramatically alter forest structure. The yellow crazy ant population is controlled by placing bait laced with the insecticide Fipronil. Surveys from spring 2002 and fall 2003 indicate a reduction in imperial pigeon populations in baited areas, though this may simply be due to seasonal differences in habitation. Nonetheless, ingestion of Fipronil is known to affect feeding behaviour, reproduction, and egg viability in other birds in the long term. ==See also== * Birds of Christmas Island ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * DEH - Christmas Island fauna - birds * Birds of Christmas Island Category:Ducula Category:Birds of Christmas Island Category:Near threatened biota of Oceania Category:Vulnerable fauna of Australia Category:Birds described in 1887 ","title":"Christmas imperial pigeon"},{"id":"9081063","text":"A beach and a saltpan south of Curral Velho Curral Velho is a deserted village in the southern part of the island of Boa Vista, Cape Verde.

Originally from Palermo, he moved to Rome with his fellow Palermitan painter and engraver Pietro del Pò. Like many painters in Rome in his day, then entered the large and prolific studio of Carlo Maratta. He afterwards worked under Giuseppe Passeri. In the 1680s Calandrucci completed decorative frescoes of the Four Seasons in the Palazzo Lante; mythological frescoes in the gallery of the Palazzo Muti Papazzurri; the decoration of the gallery of the Palazzo Strozzi-Besso; and a ceiling fresco, and the Sacrifice of Ceres in the papal Villa Falconieri at Frascati. He also painted idyllic pastoral scenes, among them two pictures at Burghley House, Stamford, England. He also painted in Rome two works for the main altar and the Cimini Chapel in the church of Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi, a Virgin and Child with St Anne and Saints in frescoes and canvases in San Bonaventura (before 1686), a Holy Family with St Anne and a St Anthony of Padua, both in San Paolo alla Regola (c. 1700), and frescoes in Santa Maria dell'Orto (c. 1700–05). In 1705 he returned to Palermo, where he began the decoration of the oratory of San Lorenzo. He also painted for the church of San Salvatore, representing The Virgin with St. Basil and other Saints. He died at Palermo. His brother Domenico and his nephew Giovanni Battista were painters of lesser renown. He left behind an abundance of drawings on topics from both historical and religious subjects to acute daily observations.(image search in Bildindex der Kunst und Architektur). ==References== * Transfiguration at the Cambridge Museum. *Artnet Grove encyclopedia abstract * Category:1646 births Category:1707 deaths Category:People from Palermo Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Sicilian painters Category:Pupils of Carlo Maratta ","title":"Giacinto Calandrucci"},{"id":"9081104","text":"Legislative election was held in France on 10 November 1946 to elect the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. The electoral system used was proportional representation. After the rejection of a first constitutional draft (5 May 1946 referendum), a new provisional National Assembly was elected to elaborate a second text. The Christian democrat leader Georges Bidault (Popular Republican Movement, MRP) led a government which included socialists (French Section of the Workers' International, SFIO) and Communists (French Communist Party, PCF). This Three-parties alliance proposed the establishment of a parliamentary system. Advocating a presidential government, General Charles de Gaulle campaigned for a \\"No\\" vote. He warned against the \\"regime of the parties\\" which was, according to him, responsible for the 1940 collapse. His followers founded the Gaullist Union. The Rally of the Republican Lefts (an electoral alliance dominated by the Radical Party) and the classical Right also campaigned for a \\"No\\", because they were opposed to a constitutional change and to the economic policy of the three-parties alliance. Despite this, the second constitutional draft was approved by 13 October 1946 referendum. The French voters were called to elect the first Assembly of the Fourth Republic. The Three-parties alliance won with a comfortable majority. The PCF regained its position as the largest party to the detriment of the Christian democrats. It obtained the best electoral result in its history. The MRP and the SFIO vote decreased slightly. Consequently, the PCF leader Maurice Thorez demanded to lead the government but his allies refused. Finally, the SFIO former Prime Minister Léon Blum took the head of the Cabinet. Furthermore, another socialist, Vincent Auriol, was elected President of France. The SFIO benefited from its position in the middle of the governmental alliance. However, the alliance split in due to the 1947 strikes and the beginning of the Cold War. The Communist ministers were dismissed by socialist Prime Minister Paul Ramadier. The SFIO, the MRP, the Radicals and the classical right allied to form the Third Force coalition, against the Communists on the one hand and the Gaullists on the other. ==Results== ==See also== * History of France#Since 1945 * List of elections in 1946 ** French legislative election in French Equatorial Africa, November 1946 Category:1946 elections in France 1946-11 ","title":"November 1946 French legislative election"},{"id":"9081125","text":"Creative Review is a bimonthly print magazine and website. The magazine focuses on commercial creativity, covering design, advertising, photography, branding, digital products, film, and gaming. The magazine is published bimonthly in print and also has an online magazine and a podcast (available on iTunes and Spotify). In addition, Creative Review runs two award schemes, The Annual, which recognises the best in commercial creativity and The Photography Annual, which celebrates the best photography work of the year. ==History and growth== Creative Review was launched in 1981, as a quarterly supplement to Marketing Week, and then becoming a stand-alone monthly magazine in its own right. In 2007, it was reported that the magazine had sold guest editorship of its February 2007 edition to an advertising agency, Mother, for £15,000, although then editor Patrick Burgoyne retained overall editorial control. He said: “I feel comfortable about it – it’s not about Mother, there’s no interview with them, it’s not puffy but it’s about important issues for the readers.” Creative Review launched a full website in 2009, after running a blog for two years, which Burgoyne had perceived as “successful” but “limiting”. In July 2017, the magazine went bimonthly, with six issues published each year. As of April 2018, Creative Review launched an online subscription, with a selection of articles only available to paying readers. Then editor Patrick Burgoyne justified the change: “To be successful today, free websites need lots of clicks and lots of advertisers. For the reader, that has come to mean high volumes of low-quality content. That is not what Creative Review is about.

It was formed from the merger of two predecessor units the First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles, and the Second Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles. The first commander was Col. John Drew, while the second was Stand Watie. ==Origin== Confederate officials commissioned Stand Watie a colonel in the Confederate States Army in July 1861 and authorized him to raise a military unit known as the Cherokee Mounted Volunteers. After Cherokee Principal Chief John Ross signed the Cherokee-Confederate treaty of alliance in October 1861, he and the Cherokee Council authorized and raised the First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles, commanded by Col. John Drew.\\"General Stand Watie's Regiment (First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers).\\" Accessed August 7, 2016. Drew's regimental officers and men were largely full-blood Cherokees, who were ideologically uncommitted to the goals of the Confederacy, but were loyal to Chief John Ross. At this time, Watie's regiment became the Second Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles. Watie's regiment consisted largely of mixed-blood Cherokees who favored the Confederate cause. ==Dissension among the troops== Drew's regiment became part of Col. Cooper's command and was ordered to help stop the flight of Union-supporting Creeks, led by their principal chief Opothleyahola, who were attempting to flee to Kansas. Although the unit participated in the Battle of Round Mountain, the Battle of Chusto-Talasah, and the Battle of Chustenahlah, they made known their dislike for fighting the Creeks, who had done the Cherokees no harm. They had expected to be fighting the invading Yankees, instead. ==Reorganization of the regiment== A portion of Drew's regiment deserted in late 1861. Following the Battle of Old Fort Wayne in October 1862, most of the remainder of Drew's men, including Maj. Thomas Pegg, deserted to the Union army. What remained of his troops was combined with Watie's regiment and reorganized as the First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles with Watie in command.\\"Clash at Chusto-Talasah; Hundreds of Rebel Indians Defect.\\" Civil War Daily Gazette\\". Accessed January 10, 2016. ==Successes under Watie== During the Civil War, Watie's troops participated in twenty-seven major engagements and numerous smaller skirmishes. Although some of the engagements were set-piece battles, most of their activities utilized guerrilla tactics. Watie's men launched raids from south of the Canadian River throughout northern-held Indian Territory and into Kansas and Missouri, tying down thousands of Union troops. Poorly equipped and armed mostly with castoff rifles or captured weapons, the Cherokees were well suited to this type of warfare. Watie was promoted to brigadier general in May 1864.Civil War in the Indian Territory. Cottrell, Steve. Pelican Books, pp. 94-95\\\\. Retrieved September 7, 2014. Watie's most spectacular victories included the capture of a Federal steamboat, the J. R. Williams, in June 1864, and the capture of a Union wagon train at the Second Battle of Cabin Creek in September 1864. His three most infamous actions were the burning of Rose Cottage, home of Chief John Ross, and the Cherokee Council House in October 1863, and the massacre of the First Kansas Colored Infantry and 2nd Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry at the Hay Camp Action (a.k.a. the Battle of Flat Rock) in September 1864. In February 1865 Watie was given command of the Indian Division of Indian Territory but was unable to launch any offensive operations. He released most of his troops following the collapse of Confederate resistance in the spring of 1865. After participating in the Camp Napoleon Council in May, Stand Watie officially surrendered on June 23, 1865, becoming the last Confederate general to lay down his arms. The regiment was dissolved. ===Battle of Pea Ridge=== This battle was on March 6–8, 1862 in Benton County, Arkansas, with a Union victory. ===Battle of Old Fort Wayne=== This battle was on October 22, 1862, in Fort Wayne, Indian Territory, with a Union victory. ===Battle of Cabin Creek=== This battle was on July 1–2, 1863 in Mayes County, Oklahoma, with a Union victory. ==Notes== ==See also== *Indian cavalry *Confederate units of Indian Territory *Indian Territory *Stand Watie *John Drew (Cherokee) ==References== ==External links== *Regimental roster *Reenactment unit *Unit history * Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture - First Cherokee Mounted Rifles * Oklahoma Digital Maps: Digital Collections of Oklahoma and Indian Territory Category:Indian Territory Civil War regiments Category:Cherokee Nation (1794–1907) Category:1861 establishments in Indian Territory Category:1865 disestablishments in Indian Territory Category:Military units and formations established in 1861 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1865 ","title":"1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles"},{"id":"9081217","text":"Jan Ruhtenberg (a.k.a.

A final interesting rumor/note, is that original designs for the famous Mies van der Rohe Barcelona Chair are rumored to bear Ruhtenberg's signature. Jan Ruhtenberg is listed as the decorator- designer of the Living Room - Fireplace Group of the Town of Tomorrow House #10 (House of Vistas) in the 1939 New York World's Fair. The coffee table strongly resembles the Barcelona Coffee Table generally attributed to the collaborative work of Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich. The Barcelona Table was originally named the 'Dessau Table' and the 'Tugendhat Coffee Table' as it gained identity associated with its use in the Villa Tugendhat in Brno in 1930, part of groupings designed by Mies van der Rohe for that home; it is called the Barcelona Table because it was used in the German Pavillion for the Barcelona World's Fair in 1929. The side chairs here attributed to Ruhtenberg bear slight resemblance to the Mid-century modern Tobia Scarpa Bastiano Lounge Chair which received the 1969 West German Design Center Stuttgart Award. ==Footnotes== ==External links== *Photographs of Ruhtenberg's professional work and personal life *Museum exhibit at Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art (iMOCA) on Jan Ruhtenberg Category:20th-century American architects Category:Architects from Colorado Category:1896 births Category:1975 deaths ","title":"Jan Ruhtenberg"},{"id":"9081241","text":"KVKL is a non-commercial radio station in Las Vegas, Nevada, broadcasting on 91.1 FM.

Rosin Coven's sound can be described as part of the Dark Cabaret movement, with strong jazz, rock, lounge, theatre and klezmer influences, amongst others. Most all of their music performed is original, with very occasional covers. For lack of a suitable genre, they came up with \\"Pagan Lounge Music,\\" based on a mock business card that a friend created and handed to them at their very first backyard gig in Berkeley, California. The band has become popular amongst many San Francisco subcultures, the most notable being devotees of the Edwardian Ball, a mini-festival based on the works of author/illustrator Edward Gorey and the Edwardian Era. They are also well known within the Burning Man crowd, having performed many times at the desert festival and at the San Francisco event known as Decompression. Rosin Coven initially formed as a trio in San Francisco in 1996, and has performed regularly in the San Francisco area continuously ever since. They have made three albums: Penumbra, Live in the Pagan Lounge, and Menagerie. == Founding == The band formed around Carrie Katz, née Davis (vocals, guitar and harp), Beth Vandervennet (cello), and Anastasia Emmons (violin). The core trio had a vision of amplified, sweeping strings accompanying driven lyrics. The three began a search for compatible musicians, primarily a drummer and bass player. Working through friends and free ads in the San Francisco Guardian, the three found Patrick Kaliski and Justin Katz, who met in San Diego as students at UCSD and played together in other bands. Beth's summer work in a trio in Yellowstone Park required a substitute cellist, and Brian Bulkowski was brought in, but the added richness of a second cello lead to his assimilation. The band's early works were primarily penned by Carrie Davis, with other members contributing. Songs were often orchestrated and improved collaboratively, leading to an eclectic mixture of sounds and songs. Justin and Patrick lived in a warehouse in the \\"Jingletown\\" district of East Oakland, where other bands formed (notably YOU, a psychedelic space-rock band), and large parties were thrown on a regular basis. Rosin Coven's first gigs were at warehouse parties, although they quickly graduated to San Francisco's clubs, such as their first gig at the Hotel Utah. It was at this gig where they were scouted by Cafe du Nord's booking agent, which led to a series of performances at that club in the years to follow. == Early years == Anastasia departed the band early, and the search was on for a new violinist. Andrea Walls, a veteran of San Francisco's rock and gypsy scene, joined the band, and the band gigged heavily in 1998 and 1999. Soon thereafter, a second female vocalist, Carri Abrahms, joined the band, adding operatically trained vocals and great depth to Rosin Coven's sound, as well as composing strong songs. The band's first album, Penumbra, was recorded during this period, and the band's debut year at Burning Man was 1999. San Francisco's live music scene was vibrant during this period, as the Dot-com bubble was in full swing. The band's mainstay club was Cafe du Nord, and they typically performed in elegant costumery with an emphasis on decor and set design. The band expanded on its theatrical roots by creating and performing a live operetta, \\"Dream of the Scarab, A Beetle Bagatelle\\", which ran in sold-out glory for only four shows on one weekend at small black-box theater space called Venue 9. This exceptional experience prodded the band to greater emphasis on theatricality and costumes, in collaboration with visualist Ken Reeser who became the band's \\"visual alchemist.\\" == Expansion == 2000 was a watershed year for Rosin Coven, with a one-month European tour primarily in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Czech Republic. The tour was repeated in 2001 with Poland and France added to the visited nations. Both the 2000 and 2001 tours included weekend gigging stints with the classic Czech rock band, Brutus. In 2002, financial strain of touring an eight-piece band led Rosin Coven to cut the tour to a week in New York City, where they played CBGB Gallery and the Flux Factory. Other than this period, the band has not toured extensively, primarily performing in the San Francisco area. Two key forces were added - trombonist Tim Carless, and vibraphonist Tim O'Keefe. Violinist Andrea left the SF Bay area for Hawaii, and a new violinist was found in Lila Sklar, who shared many of the gypsy-inspired violin techniques, but with a heavier influence on jazz than rock. Importantly, Carrie and Justin were married in late 2000, contributing to the stability of the band. Later, Tim Carless and Beth Vandervennet would marry as well, turning Rosin Coven into a decidedly family affair. The album \\"Live in the Pagan Lounge\\" was compiled from live recordings around this period, primarily for sale on the short tours. Rosin Coven's music found its way into a short film project by Yael Braha called, The Waves, which won an Eastman award. \\"Lion Song\\", from Penumbra, was heard on MTV's Big Brother, as well as in the Malcolm McDowell film, Dorian, a mediocre retelling of the Oscar Wilde novel. The band's booking and management primarily became the responsibility of bassist Justin Katz, who co-founded Berkeley arts organization Epic Arts, and began organizing and promoting his own shows, often under the PARADOX Media name. San Francisco's Edwardian Ball, celebrating both the Edwardian Period as well as writer and illustrator Edward Gorey, began in 2000 as PARADOX Media productions, initially at the Cat Club. As the event grew == Later == 2004 saw several changes, as band members settled down. Lila Sklar had a daughter, while the two couples in the band, Carrie and Justin and Beth and Tim, had boys who were born within a week of each other. Carri Abrahms left the band during this period to pursue other projects. Rosin Coven's music took even more theatrical turns, working with costumer and visual artist Gitty Duncan. Longer songs, such as the 20 minute song cycle \\"Train (A Vague Hunger)\\" created extended collaboration with local dance groups. Band members Justin, Patrick, Tim and Espie formed a project called Dr. Abacus inspired by cartoon soundtracks, burlesque and 80's glam metal during this period with saxophonist John \\"Dr. Abacus\\" Schroeder. This was, in fact a sort of continuation of Schroeder, Justin and Patricks' seminal \\"YOU\\" band that recorded 3 studio albums, hosted outrageous art parties in their Oakland loft (where R.C. first performed) and toured the western U.S. including a tour van flipping and leaving Justin's upright bass in splinters and Patrick with his now famous \\"belly scar.\\" The album \\"Menagerie\\" was recorded early in this period, showing the band with a lusher and more mature tone. It featured original paintings by Craig LaRotonda of Revelation Art. Soon thereafter, family responsibilities slowed down the band's pace, but as the children have grown, the band is back on track with new material and even larger shows. == Now == Rosin Coven continues to live and perform in the San Francisco area. Their biggest event of the year continues to be the Edwardian Ball, which has grown into a multi- city, multi-day event which in 2010 topped 4,000 in attendance. Since 2009 the Ball has been held at San Francisco's beautiful, historic Regency Center, with attendees traveling to the event from throughout the United States and from around the world, including Europe, South Africa, Japan, and the Middle East. They collaborate with their friends Vau de Vire Society, a SF-based avante- theatre-dance-circus troupe that co-create the show each year. == External links == *Rosin Coven website *The Edwardian Ball website *Dr. Abacus website *PARADOX Media Category:Dark cabaret musicians ","title":"Rosin Coven"},{"id":"9081246","text":"Ponta do Sol is a headland located in the northwest of the island of Boa Vista.

It was rumoured that a female ghost named Shih-Yun lived there, to mourn over her husband who died in a shipwreck hundreds of years ago. In the modern day, the islet is primarily used as a military training base. Since 2001, it has been opened for tourists. Ferry services to the island operate daily from the port of Keelung. There is a small port and a walkway on the island. The island is also popular with the local fishing industry, because of the quantity of fish it attracts in its surrounding sea. In 2013, the islet was closed to visitors following Typhoon Soulik. The islet remained closed to the public as damage from Typhoon Soudelor in 2015 was repaired. In July 2017, the city government allocated NT$82 million for the island's infrastructure reparation and renovation works. Plans to reopen for tourists in August 2018 were delayed until June 2019. The islet was finally reopened again on 25 June. ==Geography== The island is volcanic, part of the Chilung Volcano Group. It dates from the Pleistocene period. The eruption was explosive tholeiitic andesite and dacite. The main mineral is calcium rich plagioclase. The magma source is the western extremity of the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc formed when the subducting Philippine Sea Plate was compressed below the edge of the Eurasian Plate at about 20 to 30 km deep. The magma was contaminated with continental crust material. Geochemistry of the rock shows that iron, aluminium, titanium, potassium, rubidium and strontium are enriched, but sodium, magnesium and nickel are impoverished. ==Transportation== The island can be accessed from Keelung mainland at Badouzi, Bisha or Keelung Ports. ==See also== * List of islands of Taiwan ==References== Category:Islands of Taiwan Category:Volcanoes of Taiwan Category:Landforms of Keelung ","title":"Keelung Islet"},{"id":"9081254","text":"West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife, Scotland and the highest peak in the Lomond Hills.

There are two types of hedge recognized. For a fair value hedge, the offset is achieved either by marking-to-market an asset or a liability which offsets the P&L; movement of the derivative. For a cash flow hedge, some of the derivative volatility is placed into a separate component of the entity's equity called the cash flow hedge reserve. Where a hedge relationship is effective (meets the 80%–125% rule), most of the mark-to-market derivative volatility will be offset in the profit and loss account. Hedge accounting entails much compliance - involving documenting the hedge relationship and both prospectively and retrospectively proving that the hedge relationship is effective. ==Why is hedge accounting necessary?== All entities are exposed to some form of market risk. For example, gold mines are exposed to the price of gold, airlines to the price of jet fuel, borrowers to interest rates, and importers and exporters to exchange rate risks. Many financial institutions and corporate businesses (entities) use derivative financial instruments to hedge their exposure to different risks (for example interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk, etc.). Accounting for derivative financial instruments under International Accounting Standards is covered by IAS39 (Financial Instrument: Recognition and Measurement). IAS39 requires that all derivatives are marked-to-market with changes in the mark-to-market being taken to the profit and loss account. For many entities this would result in a significant amount of profit and loss volatility arising from the use of derivatives. An entity can mitigate the profit and loss effect arising from derivatives used for hedging, through an optional part of IAS39 relating to hedge accounting. ==What hedge accounting options are available to an entity that wants to manage foreign currency exposure?== A specific type of hedging transaction that entities can engage in aims to manage foreign currency exposure. These hedges are undertaken for the economic aim of reducing potential loss from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, not all hedges are designated for special accounting treatment. Accounting standards enable hedge accounting for three different designated forex hedges: *A cash flow hedge may be designated for a highly probable forecasted transaction, a firm commitment (not recorded on the balance sheet), foreign currency cash flows of a recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted intercompany transaction. *A fair value hedge may be designated for a firm commitment (not recorded) or foreign currency cash flows of a recognized asset or liability. *A net investment hedge may be designated for the net investment in a foreign operation. ==See also== * IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacement of IAS 39), of the International Accounting Standards Board * IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, of the International Accounting Standards Board * Fair value accounting ==References== ==Sources== *A summary of the IAS39 by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. ==External links== *IAS 39 summary as provided by Deloitte's IAS Plus website *Basic Fixed Income Derivative Hedging - Article on Financial-edu.com. *Hedge Accounting Journal Entries * Comparing Hedge Accounting Under GAAP and IFRS 9 *Richard Steiman CPA Category:Types of accounting Category:Derivatives (finance) ","title":"Hedge accounting"},{"id":"9081295","text":"Georgetown Township is a township in Vermilion County, Illinois, USA.

The First Model was manufactured between 1858 and 1859. About 5,000 were made. In United States service it was distributed to the 9th Pennsylvania and 1st Wisconsin cavalry regiments, United States Marines aboard the USS Saratoga and the United States Revenue Cutter Service. About 3,000 Maynard carbines were in Confederate hands during the war; 5,000 in .35 caliber were purchased by Florida, 650 in .50 by Georgia, and 325 in .50 and 300 in .35 by Mississippi. Around 800 were purchased by militias in South Carolina and Louisiana. The Second Model or Model 1863 was manufactured between 1863 and 1865. Over 20,000 were made. This model lacked the tape primer and stock patch box, and was used by the 9th and 11th Indiana cavalry regiments and 11th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry, among others. The Maynard had a good reputation for long-range accuracy, and Confederate sharpshooters made extensive use of it, especially during the Siege of Charleston. It was highly praised by the soldiers – Private Toby of the 1st Mississippi Infantry stated that it was \\"warranted to shoot twelve times a minute, and carry a ball effectually 1600 yards. Nothing to do with Maynard rifle but load her up, turn her North, and pull trigger; if twenty of them don't clean out all Yankeedom, then I'm a liar, that's all.\\"Weekly Arkansas Gazette, June 15, 1861, p. 1, c. 8 ==Mechanical operation== When the gun's lever was depressed, the barrel rose, opening the breech for loading. Afterwards the lever was raised to close the gun's breech. Once cocked, the loaded weapon could be primed by either placing a percussion cap directly on its nipple or by using Maynard's priming system to advance a primer to the nipple. The brass Maynard cartridge did not have an integral percussion cap; a small hole in the middle of its base fired it when the external cap was detonated. The cartridge, which had a wide rim permitting swift extraction, was reloadable up to 100 times. This proved to be a significant feature for the Confederate troops equipped with it. Another significant feature was that the use of a metallic cartridge prevented gas escape at the breech, a serious concern for early externally primed breechloaders. ==Gallery== File:MaynardCartridge.jpgAn unfired Maynard 52 caliber cartridge File:Maynard open.jpgMaynard carbine, break action, serial # 4815 File:Maynard tape -primer.JPGMaynard carbine system with Maynard tape-primer ==References== *Smith, Graham (2011). \\"Maynard Carbine.\\" Civil War Weapons.

The Hattab twins also promote the sport of running in the Middle East, especially among women. In cooperation with the World Humanitarian Marathon and Ultramarathon Foundation (WMHF), they organize the Jabal Isrhin marathon, a famous annual race that takes place in Jordan’s Wadi Rum. == Biography == Born in the Jordanian capital Amman, the Hattab twins started their running career when they were 18 years old. Their potential ability came into light after only one year, when they took part in the 1999 Dead Sea ultramarathon. In the half- marathon competition, Lama came in 3rd, while Dima finished 4th. In 2000, they participated in the same race again, with Lama winning the marathon and Dima taking the ultra marathon (50 km) title. The same year saw them taking part in the Desert Cup, an annual 168 km race. Among the female participants, both finished 9th, hand in hand. During the Desert cup, they met with Dr. Holger Finkernagel, a German doctor who heads the World Humanitarian Marathon and Ultramarathon foundation (WMHF), a non profit organization that organizes running races around the world, with the proceeds going to charitable causes. Dr. Finkernagel was keen on starting a race in Jordan’s Wade Rum, a desert valley in the south of Jordan, and he saw that the Hattab twins were capable of achieving this mission. In 2002, the Hattab twins launched the first Jabal Ishrin charity race, which took its name from the famous Jabal Um Ishrin (Mountain 20) in that area. Forty participants took part in the maiden race, and the proceeds went to for the aid of a selection of health and educational projects for children. The Jabal Ishrin race is growing year by year. Its last edition in September 2005 saw the participation of 291 contestants. Their career took another step forward in 2001 when they participated in the famous endurance race Marathon des Sables, a 250 km, a six-day race in the sub- Saharan desert of Morocco which requires all participants to be entirely sufficient, with their own supplies on their backs. During the following years, they participated regularly in various local races and also started taking part in more endurance races around the world, including La Tranzaq (216 km race in France). Being women, in addition to their choice of such a difficult sport, made them well-known figures in the Middle East, appearing in many shows on famous channels like Jazeera sport and Orbit, and also making the cover page of various magazines. But in spite of the fact of their fame, the Hattab twins are facing a lot of difficulties in taking their career to the next level, mainly due to the lack of sponsorship in the Middle East for such endurance sports, especially for women. Sometimes they had to depend on their own financial resources, and other times they were lucky to get an unlikely sponsor at the last minute. Both Lama and Dima hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Information Technology and a certificate of marathon training from WHMF.

He studied medicine in Paris, where in 1884 he became médecin des hôpitaux (hospital physician). In 1889 he was appointed chef de service (department head) at the Hôpital Lourcine, afterward working at the Hôpital Saint-Louis, where he remained until 1916. He studied exotic diseases in his travels throughout Asia. Beurmann is known for his contributions in the study of sporotrichosis, a disease that was fairly common in Europe at the time. The fungus that causes sporotrichosis was earlier identified by American physician Benjamin Robinson Schenck (1873-1920) and was named Sporothrix schenckii in Schenck's honor. Beurmann did extensive research involving the cutaneous aspects of the disease, and with Henri Gougerot (1881-1955), he published the monograph, Les Sporotrichoses, a treatise that was based on 250 cases of sporotrichoses in France. In 1903 dermatologist Raymond Sabouraud (1864-1938) suggested to Beurmann, the use of potassium iodide as a remedy. Because of Beurmann's thorough research of sporotrichosis, Sporothrix schenckii was sometimes referred to as Sporotrichum beurmanni.LIST OF SYNONYMS at timm.main.teikyo-u.ac.jp == Written works == * Recherches sur la Mortalité des Femmes en Couches dans les Hôpitaux.

Industry professional Lynn Briggs was the initial mentor of the ongoing program. In March 2012, KUNV officially became known as 91.5 The Source, a name change intended to reflect that the station is the community's source for diverse programming unavailable on commercial radio. The station also became a Billboard reporter, making it one of very few public radio stations to ever hold that honor. During the same month the station also dropped its NPR affiliation and added PRI programming to its lineup, including the nationally syndicated \\"The Takeaway\\" program. In January 2014, KUNV discontinued its PRI programming and shifted focus to locally produced programming. A few syndicated programs are obtained through PRX which air in the evenings. In July 2014, KUNV was nominated by the National Association of Broadcasters for the inaugural Marconi award for Noncommercial Station of the Year. The other nominees were KCPW, WEAA, WRHU, and WSDP.

Initially opened as a restaurant called Gerdes, by owner Mike Porco, it eventually began to present occasional incidental music. First located at 11 West 4th Street (in a building which no longer exists), it moved in 1970 to 130 West 3rd Street. It closed in 1987. On January 26, 1960, Gerdes turned into a music venue called The Fifth Peg, in cooperation with Izzy Young, the director of the Folklore Center. The Fifth Peg's debut bill was gospel folk singer Brother John Sellars and Ed McCurdy, writer of the anti-war classic \\"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\\". Porco and Young had a falling-out, and on June 1, 1960, Gerdes Folk City was officially born with a bill featuring folksingers Carolyn Hester and Logan English. At this time Gerdes Folk City was booked by a folk enthusiast Charlie Rothschild (who later became Judy Collins' longtime manager) and English. Gerdes Folk City was suddenly one of the central music venues of the era. It became one of the most influential American music clubs, before finally losing its lease in 1987. \\"Rolling Stone Book of Lists\\" called Folk City one of the three top music venues in the world, along with The Cavern and CBGB. Folk City helped to launch the careers of several world-renowned musical stars from Bob Dylan to Sonic Youth, and showcased numerous music styles from folk to alternative rock. ==History== Opening officially on January 26, 1960, Folk City was born in Greenwich Village, and generated several waves of musical genres ranging from folk music to rock 'n' roll; folk rock to punk; blues to alternative rock, bringing the world a wide range of music from Pete Seeger to 10,000 Maniacs.

On October 23, 1975 at a celebration for Mike Porco's 61st birthday, Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue staged a dress rehearsal and played its first real concert. The Revue began its national tour a week after playing at Gerdes on October 30, 1975. In May 1976, folk legend Bob Gibson and his manager Doug Yeager produced a week-long celebration to Mike Porco and Folk City, where more than thirty of the club's early star performers came out to honor the club. Folk City is the place where many of the 1960s folk-rock and '70s singer-songwriters first found their voices, and shows included future stars such as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Mamas and The Papas, the Byrds, The Lovin' Spoonful, the Youngbloods, Emmylou Harris (who also waitressed at the club), Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Snow, Loudon Wainwright III and many other well-known names. ==New ownership== Starting in 1978, the soon-to-be new owners, Robbie Woliver, Marilyn Lash and Joseph Hillesum took over the booking duties from Mike Porco, continuing to 1980 when they officially bought the club from Porco. Folk City, under new ownership, underwent a revival, bringing back folk legends like Odetta, Arlo Guthrie, Ewan MacColl (\\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\"), Maria Muldaur, Eric Andersen, The Band and others, and also introducing a new breed of singer-songwriter and expanding its boundaries to a wider range of rock music, especially alternative music like Richard Thompson, Pentangle, Elvis Costello, Sonic Youth, The Bongos (who made their debut there backing up Helen Hooke of The Deadly Nightshade), Yo La Tengo, the Replacements, 10,000 Maniacs and many others. A new wave of singer-songwriters found a home at Folk City during this time as well, such as Suzanne Vega, Shawn Colvin, Lucinda Williams and comedians Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and others. Folk City was not just about music; comedians also performed at the club throughout its history. From Martin Mull to Andy Kaufman, many comic actors and comedians got their early start at the club: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kathy Kinney, Carol Leifer, Richard Lewis, Mary Kay Place, Larry David, Jim Belushi, Andy Breckman (creator of Monk), Martin Mull, Steve Buscemi and more. Under the direction of actress/comedian/singer Jane Brucker (\\"One Life To Live, \\"Dirty Dancing\\"), improv and comedy became all the rage, with Jane introducing such new acts as Adam Sandler and Kathy Kinney (\\"Mimi\\" on the Drew Carey Show.) Actor/director, Matt Matt Mitler, created \\"Theater Night at Folk City,\\" where singer/performer Fran Maya introduced Steve Buscemi and his partner Mark Boone, Jr. (Sons of Anarchy) who became popular mainstays at the venue. Other artists in the vanguard of the performance scene who frequented \\"Theater Night\\" include John John Kelly, David David Cale, Georg Osterman, Kestutis Nakas, and Anna Anna Kohler. In the 1980s, the club underwent another revival, introducing a new breed of singer-songwriter and in expanding its boundaries to a wider range of rock music, with its alternative Wednesday night music series \\"Music For Dozens\\" which featured David Johansen, Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, Alex Chilton, the Minutemen, The Smithereens, Violent Femmes, The Replacements, 10,000 Maniacs, Richard Lloyd, Chris Stamey, Dream Syndicate, Hüsker Dü, X, Golden Palominos, the Blasters and many others. A new wave of singer-songwriters found a home at Folk City during this time as well, such as Suzanne Vega, Shawn Colvin and Lucinda Williams. In 1982, Kevin F King, and the Seven Letters performed in one of the final, Best of the Songwriters Series. In 1985, the club held a benefit 25th Anniversary Concert, which was part of the NYC Pier Summer Concerts, and was an immediate sell-out. The club lost its lease and closed in 1987, at the height of its revival. The owners, however, have continued over the years to produce and present Folk City concerts and performances around the country featuring Folk City alumni and new up-and- coming artists. A theatrical production - Folk City - a musical based on the club's history and the book \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\" by Robbie Woliver, is scheduled for Fall 2016. A 60th Anniversary celebration of Folk City was scheduled for January 24, 2020 at The Iridium nightclub in New York City, to be co-hosted by Richard Barone of The Bongos and Bob Porco, grandson of original owner Mike Porco.

He was the principal representative of the Frangipani family of Rome in the early twelfth century. One night in 1118, he interrupted the College of Cardinals in Santa Maria in Pallara sul Palatino, near his castle, and arrested the newly elected Pope Gelasius II and some of his followers. Popular opinion turned so against him, however, that he was forced to release the pope. In that one night, however, the whole relationship between the Frangipani and the Gregorian reformers broke down. In Spring 1121, Pope Callistus II destroyed the Frangipani fortress in Rome and prohibited its reconstruction. With Cardinal Aimerico of Santa Maria Novella, in 1124, Cencio allied to force the election of Honorius II. In 1125, the pope granted him the county of Ceccano and from there he sacked the Abbey of Montecassino. In 1128, Cencio and Aimerico together travelled to the court of Count Roger II of Sicily to invest him with the Duchy of Apulia from the pope. Cencio later fell out with Aimerico. On 14 February 1130, Aimerico's candidate, Innocent II, was elected pope, but immediately opposed by the Roman nobility, including Cencio, who sent a letter dated 18 May to Lothair of Supplinburg, King of Germany, asking him to support the antipope Anacletus II. Cencio was exiled from the city for the next three years until his return on 4 June 1133 to be present at Lothair's imperial coronation. ==Sources== *Caravale, Mario (ed).

A pioneer of such historical studies in France, he introduced it to University and gave it its archives base, by creating in 1949 the Centre d'histoire du syndicalisme (Historic Center of Trade-Unions) in the Sorbonne, which received important archives from activists such as Paul Delesalle, Émile Armand, Pierre Monatte, and others. He was the Center's secretary until 1969. Maitron, however, is best known for his Dictionnaire biographique du mouvement ouvrier français (DBMOF or, more currently, le Maitron), a comprehensive biographical dictionary of figures from the French workers' movement which was continued after his death, as well as a study of anarchism, History of anarchism in France (first ed. 1951), which has become a classic. Starting with the 1789 French Revolution, it includes 103,000 entries gathered by 455 different authors working under Maitron's direction. The Maitron has now extended itself with international versions, treating Austria (1971), United Kingdom (1979 and 1986), Japan (1979), Germany (1990), China (1985), Morocco (1998), United States from 1848 to 1922 (2002), a transnational one about the Komintern (2001) and the most recently published about Algeria (2006), almost all published at the Éditions de l'Atelier. Jean Maitron also founded and directed two reviews, L'Actualité de l'Histoire and then Le Mouvement social, which were directed after his death by Madeleine Rebérioux (1920–2005) then Patrick Fridenson (currently director of studies at the EHESS). ==Biography== Born in a family of teachers with Communist ideas, Jean Maitron joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1931 only to leave it the next year, opposed to its \\"social fascist\\" line. He then became a member of the Trotskyist Ligue communiste which was supporting an anti-fascist line, but he left it when Leon Trotsky advocated fusion with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) (dubbed \\"French Turn\\", which took place between 1934 and 1936). Maitron wrote to Marcel Cachin and was allowed to return to the PCF, where he remained a member until the World War II. During the 1930s, Jean Maitron traveled to the USSR (in August 1933), as well as to Germany (from 1 December 1933 to 1 June 1934) and finally to Barcelona in Spain in 1935. After the 1940 defeat of France, he immediately organized support for political prisoners, and accepted the post of secretary of Asnières's section of the Syndicat national des instituteurs trade-union (which was a member of the Fédération de l'éducation nationale). After the war, Maitron supported laïcism against clericalism, and was head of the Apremont school in the Vendée from 1950 to 1955. He joined the Union de la gauche socialiste (UGS) in 1959, which participated to the Parti Socialiste Unifié (PSU)'s foundation in 1960. Maitron left the PSU in January 1968, when it considered merging with the Fédération de la gauche démocrate et socialiste (FGDS). Maitron wrote in 1950 a study on the anarchism movement in France and wrote a complementary study of Paul Delessale, an anarcho-syndicalist. He retired in 1976 and was nominated as chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1982 and a chevalier des Arts et Lettres in 1985. Jean Maitron was cremated at the Père Lachaise cemetery and his ashes dispersed. ==Legacy== The Fédération de l'éducation nationale (FEN, a teacher's trade union) created in 1996 the Jean Maitron Award, which honors a student's work which builds on Maitron's achievements. A social history book collection also bears his name. Maitron's work is carried on by a team directed by Claude Pennetier, a researcher at the CNRS, a unit of the Centre d'histoire sociale du XXe (CNRS-University of Paris I). A new series of the Maitron dictionary, in 12 volumes, was published in 2006. Titled Dictionnaire biographique, mouvement ouvrier, mouvement social, it covers the period between 1940 and 1968. ==Bibliography== *Histoire du mouvement anarchiste en France (1880–1914), SUDEL, Paris, 1951, 744 p., out of print.

It was later included on the CD Monty Python Sings. The song has four verses; the first discussing how the world has become a terrible place (due in part to nuclear bombs that can \\"blow us all sky high\\"). The song then segues into a jaunty melody in which the singer states that he \\"likes Chinese\\". Broadly outlining stereotypes about Chinese people (an example of this is the stereotype that Chinese people are short, in the line \\"They only come up to your knees\\"), it also outlines the achievements of China and its people, including Chinese food, maoism, taoism, I-Ching, chess, penjing (\\"I like their tiny little trees\\"), Zen, ping pong, Yin and Yang, and Confucius. Near the end of the song, an erhu starts playing to add more Chinese atmosphere. A high-pitched voice created by sped-up playback and meant to represent a Chinese stereotype joins the chorus as well. The song is sung in English, and the fourth verse contains lyrics in Mandarin. The version appearing on the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show includes an accompaniment of dancers in Chinese costumes, and has additional lyrics, for example referring to the Chinese as \\"still a little communese\\".

He immediately implemented cuts of more than 11,000 staff, including six department heads and proceeded to aggressively outsource various government services. He also oversaw the passing of the , which gave the Prime Minister the power to hire and fire heads of departments. As a result, he was accused of turning the public service into an \\"ideological office family\\". Paul Barratt, a former Secretary to the Department of Defence, was one such head of department who fell out of favour with his Minister, John Moore. After the Minister sought to dismiss him, Barratt commenced legal action, claiming unfair dismissal and that Moore-Wilton had failed to follow due process. Barratt had a temporary stay, prior to his dismissal, and subsequently losing, on appeal. Moore-Wilton's approach as departmental secretary may be encapsulated in an address he gave in 1999 to the Institute of Public Administration Australia: In announcing Moore-Wilton's resignation from the Australian Public Service, with effect from 20 December 2002, Prime Minister Howard reflected on Moore-Wilton's contributions: ==Business career== In December 2002 Moore-Wilton became the Chief Executive Officer of Sydney Airport Corporation, which was majority owned by Macquarie Bank, after the Federal government gave it a 99-year contract to lease and operate the airport. During his time there he implemented his familiar cost increases to users and staff cutbacks. In addition, the company announced plans to add a high-rise office block, a multi-level car park and retail space. These plans were controversial, considering the fact that local councils, who usually have jurisdiction over such matters, had none as this was federal government land. In April 2006, Moore-Wilton resigned as CEO to become Chairman of Sydney Airport Holdings. Moore-Wilton is a Board Member of the Committee for Sydney and of Infrastructure NSW. He is also Chairman of Southern Cross Austereo, the owners of radio station 2Day FM. In 2013 Moore-Wilton caused controversy at an annual general meeting of the company by answering a question from a shareholder that sought to understand whether the company had a cultural problem, when referring to the death of the UK nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who committed suicide after being the subject of a prank telephone call by breakfast radio hosts employed by 2Day FM. Moore-Wilton stated: \\"These incidents were unfortunate, no doubt about that. In each particular case we thoroughly investigated them and it comes generally within the context of some of these incidents where a whole series of events come together and in the immortal words of someone whose identity I cannot recall \\"S-H-I-T happens\\";\\" Moore-Wilton's comments drew widespread criticism, with a British politician calling them \\"an insult to the memory of a loving mother and wife.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Australian chief executives Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Secretaries of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet ","title":"Max Moore-Wilton"},{"id":"9081647","text":"KQRT (La Tricolor 105.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Regional Mexican format.

Volksgrenadier-Division, 38. SS-Grenadierdivision Nibelungen, 32.SS- Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division 30.Januar, and the Waffen-SS Unterführerschule in Laibach (Ljubljana). ==Early life – pre-war SS Service== Hans Kempin, a son of businessman Willi Kempin, was born in Berlin-Lichtenberg. After graduating from the Hohenzollern Gymnasium in Schwedt in 1928, Hans worked as a banker. In September 1930, he joined Sturmabteilung, or the SA, and in December of the same year also the NSDAP. After two years as an SA member, in July 1932, the 19-year-old Kempin entered the SS-VT and was given the rank SS-Anwärter (Candidate). In October 1933, Hans Kempin was assigned to the premier SS-VT division Leibstandarte-SS Adolf Hitler and then sent to the new SS- Junkerschule at Bad Tölz. After his graduation he served with the SS-Standarte Deutschland and later was given command at the SS-Junkerschule Braunschweig. In 1938, he was transferred back to SS-Standarte Deutschland and remained with this unit until March 1941. ==World War II service== With the SS-Standarte Deutschland, SS–Hauptsturmführer (Captain) Kempin participated in the invasion of Poland and the subsequent operations in the West; receiving both classes of the Iron Cross. Kempin remained with this unit until March 1941 when he was transferred to the SS-Regiment Der Führer where he served first with the 13. Kompanie and later with the II. Battalion under future SS- Brigadeführer Heinz Harmel. Unfortunately, on 3 September 1941 he was seriously wounded by shrapnel from a grenade and was hospitalized until December 1941. After recovering from his injuries Hans Kempin returned to the field with the Der Führer. However, on 1 February 1942 instead of continuing on with his old regiment, Kempin was transferred as an instructor to the SS-Junkerschule at Bad Tölz and later also to SS-Junkerschule Braunschweig, and finally to Waffen-SS Unterführerschule in Posen-Treskau. On 1 December 1943, he was promoted to SS- Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel) and two months later received command of the Waffen-SS Unterführerschule located in Laibach (Ljubljana). He remained its commander until late February 1945, when he was assigned to lead first the 547. Volksgrenadier-Division then the newly formed 38. SS-Grenadierdivision Nibelungen (the name Nibelungen comes from German mythology, which was the name of a lineage of dwarves, who were defeated by Siegfried) and finally the 32. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division 30.Januar. Together with the remnants of 30. Januar (the unusual title of the division comes from the date when Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany; 30 January 1933), SS-Standartenführer Hans Kempin surrendered to the Americans on 8 May 1945. After the war he worked in agriculture and owned one of the most technically advanced farms in Germany.

Around the age of eighteen, he began to take painting lessons. Oddly enough, when his father encouraged him to take up art as a profession, Camille hesitated because he wanted it to remain a pleasant pastime, not become a job. Soon, the lessons he felt forced to take caused him disgust and he took up the study of medicine. The Lion in Love (1836) He got as far as the anatomy classes, which he found unappealing, and failed the examination. He then became a clerk in the Ministry of Finance, where his father worked, but this was also short-lived. He decided to return to painting, studying landscape and figure drawing with some local artists. Following their advice, he found a position in the studios of Abel de Pujol at the École des Beaux-arts.Brief biography @ the Wallace Collection. One day, however, Pujol showed him a painting that he admired so much he despaired of ever being able to do as well and became discouraged enough to quit. It was only with great difficulty that his friends convinced him to continue. After leaving Pujol, he studied with Antoine Gros, who gave him very little encouragement, or even attention, but he remained with Gros for three years, perhaps because he was under less stress there. After competing for the Prix de Rome, he decided to strike out on his own. At that time, he concentrated on landscape painting, which inspired him to take a trip to the Dauphiné. Many of his works are set there. ===Later career=== Girl with Flowers (1843) Upon his return to Paris, he held his first exhibit at the Salon in 1822, eventually winning a gold medal there. Despite his bad experiences as a student, he became a teacher at the École himself. Among his best-known students were Charles-Théodore Frère, Prosper Marilhat, Marie- Alexandre Alophe, Eugène Lami, Constant Troyon and Marie-Élisabeth Blavot. Later, in the 1830s, he produced historical paintings inspired by the novels of Walter Scott and painted battle-scenes at Versailles. In 1841, he created decorations for the ceiling of the library at the Palais du Luxembourg. From 1843, he returned to landscape painting and lived in the Pyrenees for several years for health reasons, where he produced scenes of peasant life. His brother Nestor was a writer and theatrical director. ==References == ==Further reading== * Germain Hédiard, Camille Roqueplan, L'Artiste (1893) == External links == * My Daily Art Display (blog): Detailed biographical information which may include original research. * ArtNet: more works by Roqueplan. * Camille Roqueplan @ the Base Joconde * Théophile Gautier: Camille Roqueplan.

Set in the aftermath of a nuclear war, it portrays a world where scientific knowledge is feared and restricted. It was nominated to the Hugo Award. ==Plot summary== In the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war, Americans have come to blame technology for the disaster, and far from seeking to recover what was destroyed, are actively opposed to any such attempt. Religious sects which even before the war opposed modern technology and avoided its use in their daily life have adjusted to the post-apocalypse situation far more easily than anyone else, and feeling themselves vindicated have come to dominate the post- war society. They gained an enormous number of new members, though those families which had been such before the war are honoured and privileged, their special status indicated by slightly different clothing. All the pre-war American cities have been destroyed in the war, and their re-construction is expressly forbidden. The US Constitution has been amended, with the Thirtieth Amendment disallowing the presence of more than a thousand residents or the existence of more than two hundred buildings per square mile anywhere in the United States. Len Colter and his cousin Esau are adolescent members of the New Mennonite community of Piper's Run. Against their fathers' wishes, the boys attend a preaching where a trader named Soames is accused and stoned to death for his apparent involvement with a forbidden bastion of technology known as Bartorstown. They are saved when a trader, Ed Hostetter, intervenes. Hostetter grabs a box from Soames' wagon, from which Esau steals a radio. Though sickened by the stoning and harshly punished by their fathers, Len and Esau are fascinated by the idea of a community that secretly still holds and harnesses the forbidden technologies. Len's grandmother, a little girl at the time of the destruction, sparks his interest in the technological past with her stories of big, brightly lit cities and little boxes with moving pictures, even a red dress. Esau and Len begin to work the radio, trying to make 'noise' come out of it. Esau steals three books from the schoolhouse in the hope that they would teach the boys to utilise the radio. The two are punished harshly after Hostetter outs them as thieves. The radio is smashed by Esau's father in rage, and Hostetter demands his wagon be searched lest he be accused of being a member of Bartorstown. Esau is whipped and Len's father is visibly disappointed. Subsequently, Esau and Len become determined to find their way to the fabled Bartorstown and leave Piper's Run in search of it, following broken dialogue heard over the radio towards a river. The boys make their way to a town called Refuge, living with the Judge Taylor and his family and working for a warehouse owner, Mike Dulinsky. Esau starts a romantic relationship with the Judge's daughter, Amity Taylor. Dulinsky wants to build a fifth warehouse to compete economically with the town on the other side of the river, Shadwell. However, this would violate the Constitution's Thirtieth Amendment as the number of buildings would exceed two hundred. He rallies the Refuge residents, who initially pledge their support. However, Judge Taylor warns Len and Dulinsky of the consequences and that he would go to the state authority. The Judge eventually betrays Dulinsky to the Shadwell residents. The Shadwell residents double-cross the Judge and kill Dulinsky and set fire to Refuge. Len, Esau and Amity are saved by Hostetter, who is revealed to be an actual member of Bartorstown. Previously, he had to oust Esau as a thief to conceal his own identity. Len is let down when Hostetter's ship turns out to be a regular coal-powered steamship, though eventually understanding it was for concealment. Strangely, Hostetter wishes to settle in a place like Piper's Run, but is unable to do so. They make a long journey to Bartorstown, a place called Fall Creek Canyon. Hostetter remarks that even those who set foot in Bartorstown do not know it is the Bartorstown, as the scientific facilities were buried from sight and Fall Creek Canyon resembles any ordinary settlement. Before the journey is complete, Len begins to think of Hostetter as a father-figure, the latter reciprocating that sentiment. In Fall Creek, Amity and Esau are wed, while the three are sworn to secrecy and are told they will be shot if they attempt to leave. The town's leaders seek to use the childlike vision that Len and Esau had of Bartorstown to inspire the workers, who have been working for long without an end in sight. Len becomes romantically tangled with a Joan Wepplo, who possesses a red dress. Joan, in contrast to Len, has resented her upbringing in Bartorstown and seeks to leave, though the residents of Bartorstown are unable to. The scientists of Bartorstown have been working on a long-term project with an Artificial Intelligence, Clementine, aimed at creating a forcefield that would eradicate the splitting of atoms, preventing future misuse of nuclear technology. They feed Clementine equations in the hope of creating the ultimate equation to produce the forcefield. Len is shocked to find that Bartorstown relies on nuclear power, conflicting firmly with his religious beliefs that the devilish nuclear power which annihilated society should be abstained from entirely. The community's rationalisation that sooner or later, others would unlock the lost secrets of nuclear technology and that it would be better to be preventive does not sit well with Len and his religious upbringing. Len's vision of Bartorstown is broken at last when Clementine is revealed to be maliciously sentient, and has withheld the ultimate truth as to whether the nuclear forcefield was ever possible, rendering the work of Bartorstown through the ages obsolete and void. Len and Joan, now married, plot an escape from Bartorstown, and the two succeed, blending in with tribals to evade Bartorstown's surveillance. Len's journey is painful and he thinks of the long walk back to Piper's Run as his religious redemption. However, they are tracked down by Hostetter. The three sit together in a small town where a preaching is occurring, in similar circumstances where Soames was stoned. Len mentally prepares for himself to die, thinking of Soames and Dulinsky and the disillusioned Bartorstown scientists and acknowledging that change would come around eventually, even if he as an individual passed on. Len gives up the opportunity to out Hostetter as a Bartorstown member to the crowd to be stoned, and Hostetter reciprocates by not ousting Len. Later, Hostetter is revealed to have armed backup that would have shot Len and Joan if he had ousted Hostetter, but Hostetter reiterates that he knew Len so long and trusted Len that he never would have needed the backup. Hostetter, Len and Joan then make their way back to Bartorstown. ==Critical reception== Damon Knight wrote of the novel: Writing in The New York Times, J.

It opened in 1961 at 147 Bleecker Street under the auspices of owner Fred Weintraub. The club changed its name to The Other End in June 1975. However, after a few years the owners changed the club's name back to the more recognizable The Bitter End. It remains open under new ownership. ==History== An earlier club, The Cock and Bull, operated on the same premises with the same format, in the late 1950s. The poet and comedian Hugh Romney (who later became known as Wavy Gravy) read there. The Bitter End was originally a coffeeshop. According to The New York Times, \\"The Bitter End, which opened in 1961, considers itself to be New York’s oldest rock club and built a legendary reputation after showcasing young performers like Joni Mitchell and James Taylor and comedians like Woody Allen and Billy Crystal.\\" At the club, Bob Dylan played pool, watched performances, and occasionally performed circa 1961. During the early 1960s, the club hosted folk music \\"hootenannies\\" every Tuesday night, featuring many performers who have since become legendary. During its heyday The Bitter End showcased a wide range of talented and legendary musicians, comedians, and theatrical performers. In 1968 Paul Colby (1917–2014), who began his career as a song plugger for Benny Goodman’s publishing company, and went on to work for Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, and Guy Lombardo, became the manager and booking agent at The Bitter End, and in 1974 he purchased it. He purchased it about a decade after he began managing the club. Owner Paul Colby died in 2014. He had two partners in the club, Paul Rizzo and Ken Gorka. A tribute concert was held for Colby after his death. According to Colby, James Taylor bombed when he played the club in 1969, and Neil Young also bombed at the club. In the mid 1970s, the club became known as the birthplace of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue, which featured such names as Joni Mitchell, Roger McGuinn, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, Joan Baez, T-Bone Burnett, Ronee Blakely, Mick Ronson, and many other guest stars. The band Cross Country recorded a 1973 hit in the club. The Bitter End was granted landmark status by the city of New York in 1992. Also in 1992, the venue's landlord tried to evict the bar, with the venue saved by benefit performances by Peter, Paul, and Mary, Kris Kristofferson, George Carlin and others. Co-owner and booking agent Kenny Gorka died in 2015. Gorka was an original member of New Jersey band The Critters. Lady Gaga performed at the bar in October 2016, after previously performing as an unsigned act at the bar before the release of her debut album. ==Live albums recorded== Albums by Biff Rose (Half-live at the Bitter End), Peter, Paul and Mary, Randy Newman, Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway, Arlo Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton, Burlap to Cashmere, The Isley Brothers and Tommy James & the Shondells, Lou Christie, The Chad Mitchell Trio among others, have been recorded live at the Bitter End. Bill Cosby's first album, Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right! was recorded there. New York based comedian Chris Rush had his second album, Beaming In, recorded there. ===Comedians=== These comedians appeared at The Bitter End early in their careers. *Albert Brooks *Bill Cosby *Billy Crystal *Cheech & Chong *Chris Rush *David Brenner *David Steinberg *Dick Cavett *Don Imus *Elayne Boosler *Flip Wilson *Freddie Prinze *George Carlin *Gilbert Gottfried *Greg Proops *Harry Anderson *Henny Youngman *Hugh Romney aka Wavy Gravy *Joan Rivers *Jon Stewart *Lenny Bruce *Lily Tomlin *Martin Mull *Mort Sahl *Pat Paulsen *Ray Romano *Richard Pryor *Rip Taylor *Robert Klein *Sandra Bernhard *Steve Landesberg *Steven Wright *Woody Allen *The Flying Karamazov Brothers ===Musicians=== *America *Andy Gibb *Ann Peebles *Arlo Guthrie *Barbra Streisand *Bette Midler *Bill Chinnock *Bill Haley *Bill Withers *Billy Joel *Billy Preston *Blues Project *Blues Traveler *Bo Diddley *Bob Carey *Bob Dylan *Bob Neuwirth *Brewer & Shipley *Bruce Springsteen *Buffy Sainte-Marie *Bunky and Jake *Burlap to Cashmere *Carly Simon *Carole King *Chad Mitchell *Charles & Eddie *Chick Corea *Chuck Berry *Chuck Mangione *Country Joe McDonald *Curtis Mayfield *Curtis Stigers *Dan Avidan *David Bromberg *David Crosby *Dean Friedman *Dion *Disappear Fear *Don McLean *Donny Hathaway *Dory Previn *Doug Kershaw *Dr. John *Ed McCurdy *Eric Weissberg *Elliott Murphy *Etta James *Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention *Frankie Valli *Fred Neil *G.

Roger Wagner, KCSG (January 16, 1914 – September 17, 1992) was an American choral musician, administrator and educator. He founded the Roger Wagner Chorale, which became one of America's premier vocal ensembles. ==Early life== Wagner was born in Le Puy, France on January 16, 1914, and died in September 17, 1992 in Dijon France.\\"Roger Wagner, 78, Founder and Leader Of 2 Choral Groups\\", The New York Times, 1992-09-19 His younger brother was actor and voiceover artist Jack Wagner. Roger Wagner was immersed in music from his youngest years. His father was an organist of the cathedral in Dijon, France and subsequently in Los Angeles, after emigrating to the United States in 1921. At the age of 12, Roger assumed his first musical position in his own right, serving as organist at St. Ambrose Church in West Hollywood.\\"Article on The Fred Bock Music Companies\\".

Women and soldiers were allowed to vote. 522 seats were elected through proportional representation. ==Parties and issues== On 21 October 1945, the French voters were called to make two choices: the election of their deputies and a referendum in order to authorize the elected National Assembly to prepare a new constitutional text. De Gaulle and the \\"Three parties alliance\\" called for a \\"Yes\\" vote, whereas the Radicals and the Conservatives campaigned for a \\"No\\". Symbol of the French Resistance to the German occupation and founder of the Free French Forces General Charles de Gaulle led a provisional government composed of the three main political forces of the Resistance: the French Communist Party (PCF), the French Section of the Workers' International (socialists, SFIO) and the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP). It advocated an economic policy inspired by the programme of the National Council of Resistance: the creation of a Welfare State, and the nationalization of banks and major industrial companies (such as Renault). The opposition was composed of the parties which had dominated the pre-war governments of the Third Republic: the Radical Party and the classical Right. ==ResultsReferendum=== The \\"Yes\\" won by 96% of the votes. This result reflected the support for the provisional government and the popular will for change. ===National Assembly=== Unsurprisingly, the \\"Three-parties alliance\\" won a large majority in the National Assembly. The Radical Party, which had been the leading party of the left in the Third Republic, suffered a catastrophic result, and the right was equally destroyed (because of its support of Marshal Philippe Pétain). They appeared as being the forces of the past, as symbols of capitulation to Nazi Germany and the regime which collapsed in 1940. The French Communist Party, which had already doubled its score in the previous 1936 elections, came out on top with around 26% of votes and 159 seats. While the PCF and SFIO favored a unicameral parliamentary regime, the MRP favored a bicameral legislature. De Gaulle advocated a presidential government. He resigned in January 1946. The PCF and SFIO proposals were rejected in the 5 May 1946 referendum. This assembly was dissolved. - ! E9E9E9;text-align:left;vertical- align:top;\\" colspan=2 Parties and coalitions !

The movie was directed by Lloyd Bacon and also features William Holden, Jane Bryan and Humphrey Bogart. The screenplay by Warren Duff was based on the novel of the same name by Warden Lewis E. Lawes, a fervent crusader for prison reform, as adapted by Jonathan Finn. ==Plot== Cliff Taylor (George Raft) is an ex-con who wants to go straight, but since being released from prison on parole, he finds it hard to find and hold a job due to his criminal past. Cliff's younger brother Tim (William Holden) is worried because he cannot afford to marry his girlfriend Peggy (Jane Bryan) and increasingly disillusioned about being able to make a position for himself in the world honestly. Afraid that Tim might end up leading a life of crime like himself, Cliff decides to help him find the money to settle down. He tells his family he has found a job as a salesman, but in reality he gets back to ex fellow convict Charles Martin (Humphrey Bogart) and they organize a number of robberies. With the money he gets from his criminal activities, Cliff is able to buy a garage for his brother, who is now able to get married. Cliff, in the meantime, decides to quit the gang. However, after a failed robbery, Martin and his pals hide in Tim's garage. The police find out, and Tim is taken to the police station. Cliff manages to exonerate his brother from the charges, but in exchange Tim has to identify the robbers and testify against them. Before the police can proceed to arrest Martin, Cliff meets him in his house and tells him to escape before being caught. However, Martin's pals, seeing their boss and Cliff together, understand that they are trying to escape and kill them. ==Cast== Cast notes: *Leo Gorcey, who would later become known for playing \\"Slip Mahoney\\" in the Bowery Boys series of films, has a small part as the head stockroom boy. ==Production== The film was originally set to star James Cagney and John Garfield. Raft then replaced Garfield. Holden ended up replacing Cagney. (The source for this information might have mistakenly reversed the names.) Raft had just signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros. During a fight scene, William Holden accidentally hit George Raft and caused a gash. Raft and Bogart made another film together the following year, Raoul Walsh's smash hit They Drive by Night, again starring Raft with Bogart billed fourth (under Raft, Ann Sheridan and Ida Lupino) in a supporting role. Bogart and Holden worked together again fifteen years later in Sabrina, with Holden billed under Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. ==Reception== The film was only a minor success. ==Critical reaction== Time Out Film Guide calls Invisible Stripes \\"A thoroughly predictable tale of the tribulations of an ex-con.\\"Time Out Film Guide review A New York Times review from 1940 commented about the unusual lack of prison scenes in the movie. \\"Let us hasten in all gratitude to add that \\"Invisible Stripes\\" is a prison picture in which the stripes are much less visible than usual, most of the action being paroled to the outside in the capable custody of George Raft, Jane Bryan, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. There are no jute mill scenes, no bullying guards, no big prison break sequence; in fact, we don't understand why they've suddenly commuted our sentence from the customary duration of the picture to a brief prison prelude, a mere graduating exercise at the beginning: good behavior, maybe.\\" ==Notes* *Review of film at Variety Category:1939 films Category:1939 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Lloyd Bacon Category:Films scored by Heinz Roemheld Category:Films set in New York City Category:First National Pictures films Category:1930s prison films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:American prison drama films ","title":"Invisible Stripes"},{"id":"9081834","text":"Pilot Township is a township in Vermilion County, Illinois, USA.

Retrieved: 2003-03-19.Benbulbin Ordnance Survey Ireland. Retrieved: 2003-03-19. sometimes spelled Ben Bulben or Benbulben (from the ), is a large flat-topped rock formation in County Sligo, Ireland. It is part of the Dartry Mountains, in an area sometimes called \\"Yeats Country\\". Benbulbin is a protected site, designated as a County Geological Site by Sligo County Council. ==Etymology== \\"Ben Bulben\\", \\"Benbulben\\", and \\"Benbulbin\\" are all anglicisations of the Irish name \\"Binn Ghulbain\\". \\"Binn\\" means \\"peak\\" or \\"mountain\\", while \\"Ghulbain\\" may mean beak or jaw, or may refer to Conall Gulban, a son of Niall of the Nine Hostages who was associated with the mountain. ==GeologyFormation=== Grange. Benbulbin was shaped during the ice age, when Ireland was under glaciers. Originally it was a large plateau. Glaciers moving from the northeast to southwest shaped it into its present distinct formation. ===Rock composition=== Benbulbin, and the Dartry Mountains as a whole, are composed of limestones on top of mudstones. These rocks formed in the area approximately 320 million years ago in a shallow sea. Uppermost in the limestone layer is a thicker, harder limestone called the Dartry Limestone Formation. Below this is a thinner transitional limestone formation – the Glencar Limestone Formation. Further down, the lower slopes consist of shaly mudstone known as the Benbulben Shale Formation. Scree deposits are found near the base. Fossils exist throughout the layers of the mountains. All layers have many fossilised sea shells. The shale layer also holds some corals. Baryte was mined at Glencarbury near Benbulbin in the Dartry range between 1894 and 1979. Benbulbin, viewed from The Hill in Sligo Town ==Climbing== Benbulbin is an established walking destination. If climbed by the north face, it is a hazardous climb. That side bears the brunt of the high winds and storms that come in from the Atlantic Ocean. However, if approached by the south side, it is an easy walk, since that side slopes very gently. From the summit there are views over the coastal plain of north County Sligo and the Atlantic ocean. The land adjacent to the western edge of the ridge is privately owned farmland and not accessible to the general public. However, there is a paved path up the south face to the east near Glencar Waterfall just over the County Leitrim border. ==Walking== One of the trails running alongside Benbulbin mountain is the Gortarowey looped walk. It runs both through the forest and out in the open overlooking Benbulbin and the bay of Donegal. It is in length and takes approximately 1.5 hours to walk. ==Flora and fauna== Benbulbin hosts a variety of plants, including some organisms found nowhere else in Ireland. Many are Arctic–alpine plants, due to the mountain's height, which allows for cooler temperatures than is normal. These plants were established after the glaciers that created Benbulbin melted. Wild hares and foxes inhabit Benbulbin. In 2012, research revealed that the fringed sandwort had survived the Ice Age and is perhaps 100,000 years old. In Ireland the plant is unique to Benbulbin. The discovery calls into question the prior consensus that Ireland's flora and fauna date from or after the end of the Ice Age. ==In Irish history== Another view of Benbulbin's northern side, this time from a greater distance. ===Irish legends=== Benbulbin is the setting of several Irish legends. It is said to be one of the hunting grounds of the Fianna, a band of warriors who are said to have lived in the 3rd century. One example is the story of The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne, in which the warrior Diarmuid Ua Duibhne (Diarmuid) is tricked by the giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) into fighting an enchanted boar, which later kills the warrior by piercing his heart with its tusk. McCool is also said to have found his long-lost son Oisín at this location. The mountain is said to be Diarmuid and Gráinne's resting place. Also, in the 6th century, St. Columba fought a battle on the plain below Benbulbin at Cúl Dreimhne (Cooladrumman) for the right to copy a Psalter he had borrowed from St. Finnian. ===Irish Civil War=== On 20 September 1922, during the Irish Civil War, an Irish Republican Army column, including an armoured car were cornered in Sligo. The car was destroyed by another armoured car belonging to the Irish Free State's National Army, and six of the IRA soldiers fled up the Benbulbin's slopes. In the end, all were killed, allegedly after they had surrendered. They are known as the \\"Noble Six\\". Brigadier Seamus Devins TD, Div. Adj. Brian MacNeill, Capt. Harry Benson, Lieut. Paddy Carroll, Vols. Tommy Langan and Joe Banks were those killed on the mountain.Sligo: Benbulbin \\"The Noble Six Cross\\"© Copyright Michael Murtagh and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence.

The six anti-treaty fighters were hunted down on the slopes of Benbulbin and put to death by Free State forces which were out to avenge the killing of Brigadier Joseph Ring eight days earlier. Two of those killed and Ring were ancestors of current and recent politicians: Ring is the grand uncle of Michael Ring, McNeill is the uncle of former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell and Devins is the grandfather of Jimmy Devins.

On 9 December 1943, a USAAF Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress plane (en route from Goose Bay, Labrador to Prestwick, Scotland) crashed on Truskmore just east of Benbulbin. 10 airmen were aboard, of whom three died, two at the scene and one from injuries sustained in the crash. Local residents undertook a rescue mission, taking the injured off the mountain where they were then transferred to Sligo County Hospital. Substantial wreckage of the plane stayed on the mountain for many years following the crash and today limited amounts of aircraft fragments still remain at the site. Near the location of the Flying Fortress crash, there was an earlier crash also involving a military aircraft. On 21 March 1941, an RAF Catalina flying boat (AM265) using the Donegal Corridor crashed into the mountain at Glenade, Co. Leitrim on the east side of Truskmore. All nine airmen aboard died in the crash. ===Recent history=== In the 1970s and 1980s, Sinn Féin had engaged in a slogan campaign around the theme 'Brits out of Ireland'. Roads and walls throughout Ireland had been marked with these slogans as was Benbulbin in 1977. It was marked first with 'Brits Out' (180 ft wide and 25 ft high) and then later with the slogan 'H-Block'. Benbulbin overlooks the village of Mullaghmore, the site of the assassination of Lord Mountbatten in 1979. As stated above, Benbulbin is a protected site, designated as a County Geological Site by Sligo County Council. However, in May 2018, 'Vote No' (8th amendment) campaigners erected a large \\"NO\\" sign, severely impacting the iconic view. Sligo County Council responded on social media with the following statement, \\"As the land where the lettering was placed is commonage, Sligo County Council has no role in this matter\\". ==Notable people== The athlete Mary Cullen is from nearby Drumcliffe. Andy \\"The Bull\\" McSharry, involved in a famous 17-year-long dispute over allowing access rights over his land, lives near Benbulbin. ==In literature== Benbulbin features prominently in the poetry of W. B. Yeats, after whom Yeats Country is named. County Sligo is considered integral to the poet's work. The mountain is one of the destinations on the Passport Trail of the poet's life. Yeats wrote the following in The Celtic Twilight: The mountain is also mentioned in Yeats's On a Political Prisoner, in which he recalls the Countess Markiewicz riding past it to political meetings. Yeats's famous poem, Under Ben Bulben, is essentially a description of Yeats Country. It describes the sights that he saw in Yeats Country. The following is an excerpt from Under Ben Bulben: This was Yeats's final poem, published in The Irish Times. He is buried in Drumcliffe Churchyard, in the shadow of Benbulbin. ==See also== * List of mountains in Ireland * Wiktionary definition of a ben ==References== ==External links== * Tourist information * An image of Benbulbin with a small caption * Information, pictures and a panorama of Benbulbin * Hiking the Benbulben and the old coal mine * Sinn Féin Anti British Slogans 1977 ===Yeats=== * An essay on the Benbulbin in Yeats' poetry * A second site detailing Benbulbin in Yeats' poetry * Reading of \\"Under Ben Bulben\\" by Jim Norton on RTÉ Radio 1 Category:Marilyns of Ireland Category:Mountains and hills of County Sligo ","title":"Benbulbin"},{"id":"9081905","text":"The Innocence Project is a television drama series created by BBC Northern Ireland and first broadcast on BBC One on 9 November 2006. The series follows the work of Professor Jon Ford (Lloyd Owen), who sets up The Innocence Project, peopled entirely by a hand-picked group of law students. They take on cases pro bono that no one else will handle, or those that have been forgotten or given up on, working for clients that would otherwise have no hope, and who have possibly been wrongly convicted. The series is based on a British version of the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal clinic in the United States. The Innocence Project fared particularly poorly for a BBC primetime drama, and received a number of negative reviews. In an unusual move for the BBC, the series was pulled from the schedules mid-run, and the final three episodes were not broadcast until over a month later. The BBC subsequently confirmed that the series would not be renewed. Notably, the series has also never been issued on DVD. ==Foundation== The first and best-known Innocence organization is based at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University. It directly serves defendants who can conclusively be proven innocent by DNA testing of evidence done after their convictions. The clinic was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. In addition to working on behalf of those who may have been wrongfully convicted of crimes throughout the United States, the Innocence Project performs research and advocacy related to the causes of wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project is a member of the recently formed Innocence Network, which brings together a number of innocence organizations from across the United States. As of 2012, 292 defendants previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States have been exonerated by DNA testing. Almost all of these convictions involved some form of sexual assault and approximately 25% involved murder. Dr. Michael Naughton, founder and director of the Innocence Network UK (INUK), set up the first innocence project in Britain at the University of Bristol in January 2005. Additionally, INUK has actively assisted in setting up over 30 innocence projects in British universities and referred approximately 90 cases to member innocence projects for further investigation. ==Cast== * Lloyd Owen — Professor Jon Ford * Christine Bottomley — Sarah Shawcross * Ruth Bradley — Beth McNair * Stephen Graham — Andrew Lucas * Oliver James — Nick Benitz * Luke Treadaway — Adam Solomons * Shelley Conn — Dr. Eve Walker * Andrea Lowe — Philippa Lucas * Ruta Gedmintas — Mary Jarvis * Thomas Turgoose — Darren \\"Dizzy\\" Littlewood * Charlotte Emmerson — Lizzie Ford ==Episodes== ==See also== *The Innocence Project, which refers to a number of non-profit legal clinics in the United States *In Justice, an American TV series with a similar premise ==References*The Innocence Project TightropePictures.com *The Innocence Project BBC.co.uk Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2007 British television series endings Category:2000s British drama television series Category:BBC television dramas Category:British crime drama television series Category:2000s British legal television series Category:Television shows set in Manchester Category:Wrongful convictions Category:English-language television shows Category:2000s British crime television series ","title":"The Innocence Project"},{"id":"9081916","text":"KOAS (105.7 FM, Jammin' 105.7) is a radio station broadcasting an Urban AC format.

Christianity has been practiced in Europe since the first century, and a number of the Pauline Epistles were addressed to Christians living in Greece, as well as other parts of the Roman Empire. According to a 2010 study by the Pew Research Center, 76.2% of the European population identified themselves as Christians.Christianity in Europe, including the Asian part of Russia, excluding the European part of Turkey As of 2010 Catholics were the largest Christian group in Europe, accounting for more than 48% of European Christians. The second-largest Christian group in Europe were the Orthodox, who made up 32% of European Christians. About 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition. Russia is the largest Christian country in Europe by population, followed by Germany and Italy. Since at least the legalization of Christianity by the Roman Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, Europe has been an important centre of Christian culture, even though the religion was inherited from the Middle East and important Christian communities have thrived outside Europe such as Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East since the time of Christ. Christian culture has been an important force in Western civilization, influencing the course of philosophy, art, and science. Europe has a rich Christian culture, especially as numerous saints, martyrs and popes were European themselves. All of the Roman Catholic popes from 741 to 2013 were from Europe. Europe brought together many of the Christian holy sites and heritage and religious centers.Quoted in Robin Lane Fox, The Unauthorized Version, 1992:235. ==History Early history === Patron saints of Europe. St. Peter's Basilica Historians believe that St. Paul wrote his first epistle to the Christians of Thessaloniki (Thessalonians) around AD 52. His Epistle to the Galatians was perhaps written even earlier, between AD 48 and 50. Other epistles written by Paul were directed to Christians living in Greece (1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Philemon, Philippians, 2 Thessalonians) and Rome (Romans) between the 50s and 70s of the first century. Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow The Record of Saint Dorotheus Bishop of Tyre is that the Church at Tyre sent Saint Aristobulus (of the seventy) to Britain as bishop in AD 37. The Church seems to have been begun by him around the Bristol Channel area and 150 years later we have names of bishops recorded. By AD 550 there are recorded 120 bishops spread throughout the British Isles. Armenia was the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its state religion in AD 301. The oldest state-built church in the world, Etchmiadzin Cathedral, was built between AD 301–303. It is the seat of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Roman Empire officially adopted Christianity in AD 380. During the Early Middle Ages, most of Europe underwent Christianization, a process essentially complete with the Baltic Christianization in the 15th century. The emergence of the notion of \\"Europe\\" or the \\"Western World\\" is intimately connected with the idea of \\"Christendom\\", especially since Christianity in the Middle East was marginalized by the rise of Islam from the 7th century, a constellation that led to the Crusades, which although unsuccessful militarily were an important step in the emergence of a religious identity of Europe. At all times, traditions of folk religion existed largely independent from official denominations or dogmatic theology. From the Middle Ages onwards, as the centralized Roman power waned in southern and central Europe, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe. Movements in art and philosophy, such as the Humanist movement of the Renaissance and the Scholastic movement of the High Middle Ages, were motivated by a drive to connect Catholicism with Greek thought imported by Christian pilgrims. === East–West Schism and Protestant Reformation === Canterbury Cathedral is the cathedral of the Archbishop of Canterbury of the Protestant Church of England The East–West Schism of the 11th century and the Protestant Reformation of the 16th tore \\"Christendom\\" into hostile factions. Following the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, atheism and agnosticism became widespread in Western Europe. 19th-century Orientalism contributed to a certain popularity of Buddhism, and the 20th century brought increasing syncretism, New Age and various new religious movements divorcing spirituality from inherited traditions for many Europeans. The latest history brought increased secularisation, and religious pluralism.Henkel, Reinhard and Hans Knippenberg \\"The Changing Religious Landscape of Europe\\" edited by Knippenberg published by Het Spinhuis, Amsterdam 2005 , pages 7-9 == Cultural influences == St Mark's Basilica in Venice, a mixture of Italian and Byzantine featuresWestern culture, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as cultural Christians. The notion of \\"Europe\\" and the \\"Western World\\" has been intimately connected with the concept of \\"Christianity and Christendom\\" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity. Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the Greek and Roman empires, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Europe. Until the Age of Enlightenment, Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science. Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into Christian philosophy, Christian art, Christian music, Christian literature etc. Christianity had a significant impact on education and science and medicine as the church created the bases of the Western system of education,Encyclopædia Britannica Forms of Christian education and was the sponsor of founding universities in the Western world as the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the Medieval Christian setting.Rüegg, Walter: \\"Foreword.

In its first year, 1891-1892 the average daily attendance was 8 pupils. The school was destroyed by fire in 1929, right after Christmas vacation. Approximately 100 pupils and 3 teachers had just gathered on the first day back at school when the fire broke out. The cause of the fire was traced to a defective brick chimney resulting from a dynamite blast set off nearby in oil exploration activity. Fairfax Cafeteria service dates back to 1928 when Mrs. Rench, one of the founders of the Fairfax PTA began cooking food for children's lunches in her home and transporting them to the school in kettles. Fairfax remained a small rural school until the late 1930s when it tripled in size going from an average daily attendance of 102 in 1934-35 to 312 in 1938-39. This rapid growth came as a result of many farm laborers coming into the area during the depression years. At times the student population would double overnight due to the seasonal influxes of migrant families. Large tents would be put up and temporary teachers were hired, as needed. School bus service began in 1936 when an old Reo bus was purchased from the Kern County High School District. The 1952 Kern County earthquake rendered Fairfax School unfit for occupancy. This led to the construction of the present Fairfax School. By the 1960s the average daily attendance for the District was 807. Currently the average daily attendance for the District nears 2000. Fairfax became a grade 4 – 8 school in 1999. In 2005 it became a grade 6-8 school and was renamed Fairfax Middle School. Virginia Avenue School opened in January, 1953, with eight classrooms and the present cafeteria. Virginia Avenue became a k-4 school in 1999 and a K-2 school in 2005. Shirley Lane Elementary School opened in 2005. Six classrooms were added in 2006 to accommodate the rapid growth in the district. Shirley Lane Elementary is a grade 3-5 school. Zephyr Lane Elementary is the newest school added to the district, thus, changing Fairfax Middle school to a Junior High, serving only 7th and 8th grade students now. ==References== Category:School districts in Kern County, California Category:Education in Bakersfield, California ","title":"Fairfax School District"},{"id":"9081937","text":"Alexandra Michele Wescourt (born 12 July 1975) is an English actress. ==Early life== Wescourt was born in London, England, the daughter of Gordon Wescourt Sr. and Gillian Margaret Elvins.

It features Flappy, a somewhat mole- like character who must complete each level by pushing a blue stone from its starting place to the blue tile destination. Flappy first appeared on the Sharp X1 home computer in 1983. This debut was soon followed by conversions to a number of popular Japanese computers in the early 1980s, including the NEC's line of PCs and the Fujitsu FM series. Ports for the MSX computer line and the Family Computer were released in 1985.Famicom Games , Famicom World. dB-Soft produced a sequel with more difficult puzzles called King Flappy for the benefit of anyone who managed to clear the original 200 levels (or \\"sides\\" as the game calls them). A Nintendo Game Boy port was released exclusively in Japan in 1990 and was published by Victor Musical Industries.Flappy Special, Gamekult.com. ==Storyline== The beautiful planet of Blue Star, home-planet to a young boy named FLAPPY, is invaded by Dark Emperor Ngalo-Ngolo. The proud inhabitants of Blue Star, wanting neither war nor the invasion, self-destruct along with the planet on a path of self-determination. FLAPPY, however, is boarded onto an escape capsule headed for neighboring Planet Seviras by his father and so survives. From his capsule he sees fragments of the exploded Blue Star rain down incessantly on Planet Seviras. Wandering aimlesslessly about Planet Seviras, FLAPPY reaches an oasis where he suddenly hears a voice from the sky saying, 'Gather up the fragments of Blue Star, the Blue Stones, to this Blue Area. When all of them have been gathered...' FLAPPY, believing a miracle has just occurred, begins on a journey to gather all the Blue Stones. ==Gameplay== Gravity, gaps in the floors, and wandering enemies stand in the way of Flappy reaching his goal. Flappy can pick up and throw sleeping mushrooms at the enemies to knock them out for a while, or drop stones on them to crush them permanently. There are, however, many obstacles along the way: brick walls you must work your way around, brown stones which you can crush but which can also crush you if they fall on you, holes or dead angles in which the blue stone becomes irretrievable if it falls into them, and moving enemies. The game features just two enemies: Unicorns and Ebira. Unicorns are green creatures that move in mostly-repetitive horizontal patterns. Ebira are red crab-like enemies (the word \\"ebi\\" is a Japanese term for shellfish) that relentlessly chase Flappy both horizontally and vertically. Ebira tend to mimic Flappy's movements, so Flappy must be careful to avoid being charged by a persistent Ebira. ==Ports== *Sharp X1 (1983) *Sharp MZ-800 (1984) *PC-6001mkII ・FM-7 ・PC-8801 ・PC-8001mkII (1984) *MSX (1985) (as Flappy Limited '85) *Family Computer (1985) *PMD 85 (1987) *i-mode (2004) *Yahoo!

It was unique at the time for incorporating both an ARM2 coprocessor for the chess engine on an ISA card which plugged into an IBM PC and a software interface running on the PC to display a chess board and control the engine. The ISA card was sold with a CPU running at either 16 MHz or 32 MHz, and 128 KB, 512 KB, or 1 MB of onboard memory for transposition tables. This made economic sense at the time of introduction because mainstream PCs were only running from 10 MHz to 25 MHz. Two engines were sold with the card: The King by Johann de Koning and Gideon by Ed Schröder. Gideon was famed for winning two World Computer Chess Championships on this hardware. The King later became the engine used in the popular Chessmaster series of chess programs. TASC later incorporated the technology into a dedicated unit, sold from 1993 to 1997. There were two models, the R30 and R40, running at 30 MHz and 40 MHz respectively, and having 512 KB and 1 MB of transposition tables, respectively. The units were in small boxes about the size of a chess clock, which attached via a serial cable to a wooden sensory board called the SmartBoard. They were only sold with The King chess engine. This was the end of the era of strong dedicated chess computers, and these two models are acknowledged as the strongest dedicated chess computers that were ever sold. At the height of its strength, the R30 attained a rating over 2350 on computer rating lists, higher than any other dedicated unit.

Kiernan (January 25, 1902 – January 8, 1978) was an American radio, television, and print journalist and author, as well as television game show host during the early days of the medium. ==Career== Walter Kiernan began his career as a journalist in New Haven in the early 1920s as a feature writer for the Elm City (Conn.) Clarion and the New Haven (Conn.) Union. He was a writer and editor of the New Haven Register from 1926 to 1928. He wrote for The Saturday Evening Post and started The Town Crier newspaper of West Haven, Connecticut in 1930. Kiernan was an Associated Press (AP) correspondent from 1928–29 and joined the now long since defunct International News Service (INS) as manager of its Hartford bureau in 1937. The following year he was moved to New York, serving until 1943 as a roving reporter and special assignment writer for INS, during which he spent a remarkable New Year's Eve with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a train ride from the United States to Canada during World War II. While a staff correspondent for the INS, Kiernan wrote the syndicated column Manhattan Side Streets which appeared in papers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Indiana and Texas. His column One Man's Opinion was also nationally syndicated by INS. In addition to his fascinating train ride with Winston Churchill, he had previously covered Douglas \\"Wrong Way\\" Corrigan's return to New York, as well as the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during their royal tour of Canada in 1939. He also wrote a \\"Broadway\\" column in the Dallas Times Herald. In 1942, he co-authored with another noted columnist, Damon Runyon, The Life Story of Captain Eddie Rickenbacker As heard at The Paley Center for Media (formerly The Museum of Television and Radio), Kiernan's animated reporting and analysis of V-E Day in 1945 remains one of the era's most stirring historical recordings. Walter Kiernan eventually hosted his own news analysis program, Kiernan's Korner, which ran throughout 1948 for ABC Radio. On ABC Radio in 1948 he had a chat program called That Reminds Me, with former New Jersey Governor Harold Hoffman and \\"Uncle Jim\\" Harkins. He had an ABC radio chat show in 1951 called Family Circle. Among his guests was Winston Churchill's actress daughter Sarah. ==Radio and television== Kiernan hosted several daytime chat and commentary programs on both radio and television throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, including Kiernan's Corner (1948), Sparring Partners (1949), What's the Story (1951-1953), Who Said That? (1951-1954), I've Got a Secret (1952), Who's the Boss? (1954), and history show Stroke of Fate (1952–1953). After the relative success of Stroke of Fate, he began co-hosting NBC Radio's long- running news magazine, Monitor. Kiernan co-hosted Monitor from 1955 to 1960, when the program's format was dramatically changed. A familiar baritone voice on New York radio for many years, Kiernan's commentary program on WOR Radio's, One Man's Opinion, was heard daily, in addition to co-anchoring WOR-TV's local evening news. He was also a past president of the Catholic Actors Guild in New York.Obituary in the Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal of January 9, 1978 In more national issues he was an early outspoken critic of United States policy in Vietnam, raising objections as early as 1965, and later covering the Paris peace talks. Walter Kiernan was most remembered in political circles for his reporting of every national political convention from 1940 through 1972. Kiernan retired from journalism after covering the 1968 Republican Convention in Miami. Walter Kiernan died after a protracted struggle with cancer in 1978 at the age of 75. == References The Monitor Communicators * Stroke of Fate Category:1902 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American game show hosts Category:American Roman Catholics ","title":"Walter Kiernan"},{"id":"9082164","text":"The Michigan Virtual High School is a program funded by the Michigan legislature in July, 2000.

He took control of Friuli at the command of King Grimoald following the rebellion of Lupus and Arnefrit and the invasion of the Avars. According to Paul the Deacon, he was a mild and fair ruler. Soon after Grimoald pacified the region, Wechtar was appointed duke. Soon after his appointment, he travelled to Pavia and, while he was away, the Slavs, formerly allies of Arnefrit, invaded his duchy. They intended to take Forum Julii (modern Cividale) and camped at Boxas, the location of which remains uncertain. Some have put it at Purgessimus,Bethmann. some at Prosascus near the source of the Natisone (Natisio), still others at Borgo Bressana,Waitz. and finally, and most definitively, near Brischis just outside the city.Musoni, pp 187 - 188. Paul relates that Wechtar had just returned from Pavia at the same time when he heard of their encampment and marched against them with twenty five men. At a bridge over the Natisone,Possibly that of San Pietro dei Schiavi (Waitz) or that of San Quirino (Musoni, p 191). Also possible near Purgessimus, if that was the site of Slavic encampment. Wechtar met them and, again according to Paul, defeated them in a route.Two anecdotes surround this brief expedition, the one concerning the insulting Slavic joke that the twenty six men advancing on them must be the Patriarch and his clergy, and the other concerning Wechtar's baldness, which he revealed by removing his helmet in order to inspire fear and flight in his enemies. The patriarch was then seated in Aquileia and not until 737 in Cividale, which supports doubts about this story. The historical accuracy of Paul's account has, on the basis of its outrageous numbers, been called into question. Wechtar died and was succeeded by Landari. ==References== ==Further reading== *Paul the Deacon. Historia Langobardorum. Translated by William Dudley Foulke.

As with many other games in the series, it has not been released outside Japan for any consoles. This is the first Puyo Puyo game to be released on the Wii console. == Plot == Ms. Accord, the teacher at the Primp Magic School, informs Sig that there will be a tournament up for play, and everyone's competing; the reward is a medal that will grant anyone's single wish. Another scene shows Amitie and Arle pledging to play by the rules, and Sig, still as clueless as ever, eventually pledges as well, but not before witnessing six comets fall down onto Earth. Sig, realising that this is a big discovery, decides to ignore it anyhow and goes onto the competition. It turns out that the \\"comets\\" are actually six familiar characters from the Madou series, who serve as boss characters in the story modes. == Characters == As Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary was created to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of Puyo Puyo, it includes most of the Fever characters plus six of the characters from the Madou series; they are said to have fallen from the sky into Primp Town, the primary setting of the Fever series games. There are a total of twenty-two characters in this game. == Gameplay == 15th Anniversary has a slew of new modes, and also includes modes that emulate the original Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo Tsu and Puyo Pop Fever. In most cases, players are eliminated when he/she tops out, and the last player (or side) standing wins the round. ;Puyo Puyo :This mode emulates quite accurately the gameplay of the original Puyo Puyo. ;Puyo Puyo 2 :This mode emulates the gameplay of Puyo Puyo Tsu. ;Puyo Puyo Fever :This is Fever mode, similar to gameplay of Puyo Pop Fever and Puyo Puyo Fever 2, but with some small updates. The Fever counter is more rigid and actually represents the time that players have - when time expires, that time cannot be extended by the end of a chain. In addition, Fever time is now earned not when the opponent offsets but instead when the player makes a chain that does not offset. ;Big Puyo :In this mode, Puyo are twice as large in both directions and the board itself is only 3 by 6 Puyo, a quarter of the normal board size. Less garbage is sent to opponents in this mode. The objective is simply to defeat all opponents. ;Bomber :In this mode, instead of sending nuisance Puyo, players send bomb blocks, which explode after the user with them makes a certain number of moves and change all surrounding Puyo into Hard Puyo. ;Endless Fever :In this mode, players start off with a Fever that does not end and a large number of pending Nuisance Puyo. They can't fall, however, so they are only there to be offset until one player finishes offsetting and overflows into the Fever trash galley of the opponents. ;Excavation :In this mode, players start with a half-filled regular board. Hidden on the bottom row is a star, that, when popped, will send infinite garbage to all other opponents. The goal is to pop the Star Puyo and defeat the opponents. Once one player has popped the star, offsetting is no longer allowed, so if both players happen to get it at the same time, Nuisance Puyo will begin dropping with the next Puyo pair dropped. ;Spinner :In this mode, the fields will rotate every 15 seconds. The counter acts similar to the Fever counter - when time expires, it waits for players to drop their last Puyo. When all players are idle after time expires, the boards spin 180 degrees and then gravity acts on the Puyos. A special bonus is given to chains that continue after or are started from the spin. ;Ice Blocks :In this mode, instead of sending nuisance Puyos, players send frozen Puyo blocks, which become unfrozen after the player who has them makes 3 moves. Because of the nature of sending the other player Puyo blocks that have the ability to chain, this mode can turn around if the chain created by the original sender is not large enough to defeat the opponents. ;Mission :In mission mode, players are given a task which they must complete before their opponents. The first player (or side) that completes 3 tasks before the opponents do wins the round. ;Searchlight :In this mode, all the players' Puyo boards are only partially visible on the screen at any time (except during Fever mode). The visibility range is a cone, originating from the top of the screen and expanding downward, which is in a constant sway, lampooning a searchlight. This mode is difficult because it disorients proper placement of Puyos, or causes the player to have to slow down and wait for the searchlight to pass an area unknown to them in order to make proper chains. ;Underwater :Water mode is a slow-moving mode where players place Puyos into a body of water filled up to two Puyo. Puyo float in the water, making the mode, in essence, the same as placing Puyo at the bottom of a Puyo board. Because of the nature of this mode, Nuisance Puyos only fall in groups of 1 line. This prevents Nuisance Puyo from causing chains due to the unequal descent of the columns. == DS Version Multiplayer == The DS version of 15th Anniversary supports all multiplayer modes that the DS officially supports. === Everybody Puyo Puyo === In this mode, players without a copy of 15th Anniversary can play along with those that do. The only difference between playing with a copy and without a copy is that the download and play version does not contain voices or battle animations. The game is functionally compatible, for the most part. Therefore, both the DS Download and Play modes and direct connection modes are accessible from here. Up to 8 players can play and in any mode that the number of players permits. However, for technical reasons (such as alternative drawing methods being used in 8-player mode to keep the game from lagging), you can only play Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo TSU, and Puyo Puyo Fever modes in games with more than four players. === WiFi === In this mode, you can use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to verse players across the internet. WiFi mode supports only 3 modes (Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Puyo Puyo Fever). You can play games of between two and four players, either with your friends using the Friend Code system or against random opponents. When playing random games, three-player mode and the original Puyo Puyo rules are not available, and you can earn (or lose!) points if playing a two-player game. == Issues == Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary for the DS had several issues. === Saving === In the original release of Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary, a bug existed where data would not be saved more than 255 times. A new version, nicknamed 1.1, was released to solve the problem on January 20, 2007. Information on how to find out the game version and instructions on how to get replacement can be found on Sega's website. === WiFi === In both of these versions existed yet another bug, this one effecting WiFi. When a player disconnected, both lost points. A new version was released to solve this problem. === Fever meter bug === While playing multiplayer games, the fever meter will occasionally freeze on 7 points without letting you into fever mode. It will subsequently let you in after your next move, but this may be deadly depending on the circumstances. This bug can also be seen in version 2.00 of the PC version of Puyo Pop Fever. ==Trivia== *A new garbage symbol was added (comet/1440 garbage).

It was due to begin construction in 2008. It was intended to relieve Belgrade's growing traffic congestion issues, with the first stretch of line opening in 2012. The first line has an estimated cost of 450 million euro, taking some 5 years to complete.Direkcija za gradjevinsko zemljište i izgradnju Beograda - BELAM - Trasa prve linije == Concept == The idea to construct a rapid transit system in Belgrade originates from the 1950s when it was driven by Belgrade's blooming number of inhabitants and the lack of adequate transport infrastructure. However, the inability to decide between proposals to construct a modern tram system and a classic underground one meant that the project was to stay largely stagnating in years to come. The political turmoil of the 1990s and lack of potential funding extinguished further development of the idea. With the beginning of the 21st century, however, the idea came to life once again, facing similar problems. Despite fierce debates on the most adequate solution, Belgrade's present leadership pressed on with a pre-feasibility study on a light rail system which received a positive review in the late 2001.Belgrade Land Development Public Agency - Pre-feasibility study in English BELAM, consequently, became an integral part of Belgrade's master plan for 2021.Belgrade Land Development Public Agency - The Master Plan until 2021. Construction was due to begin in 2006, but was postponed till 2008. Serbian group JUGINUS () and Spanish INECO are in charge of the construction. Although the project's implementation seems rather certain at this point, fierce criticism by opponents has not ceased. Their main argument remains that the only criterion for choosing light rail over conventional metro was the comparatively low cost. They insist that constructing a light rail transit system will not deal with the capital's transport issues in the long run.Večernje Novosti - Metro je rešenjeVečernje Novosti - Uzalud uloženi novci On the other hand, project supporters maintain that the economic aspect is essential. Furthermore, they claim that estimates on maximal usage of the lines cannot exceed 13,000–14,000 passengers/hour (on the busiest stretches), at least not in the next 20 years, whilst the system's capacity maxes out at 20,000 passengers/hour. The possibility of conversion to a conventional metro and easy connections to existing tram lines are, according to the supporters, further arguments in favor of light rail.Belgrade Land Development Public Agency - LRT Project booklet in English There are certain speculations that the project would be abandoned in favor of a conventional metro, if Belgrade's government were to change. == Lines == Belgrade's Master plan for the year 2021 envisions three lines operating within the system. The strict timeline that saw the construction of the third line commencing as soon as 2012 has now been abandoned and the only relatively fixed date has the year 2008 as the dead-line for the beginning of Phase 0 of construction. === Line 1 === Central line of Belgrade Light Metro Line 1 – Central line ( / Centralna linija) is to be constructed first. The pre- feasibility study has it denoted as \\"primary\\". The overall length of the line should be 12,5 km, with 20 stations (12 overground, 8 underground). The line is intended to start from the Tvornička St. in Zemun, headed towards the municipality of Novi Beograd, and further east, towards the river Sava. After crossing the river over a designated bridge constructed adjacent to the existing one (Brankov most) the line is then planned to enter deep-level tunnels, calling at Square of the Republic and Nikola Pašić Square before moving on in the direction of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. From that station onwards, the line should then resurface and would follow the Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra St. terminating at its intersection with Ustanička St. The full list of stations is as follows: *Tvornička St. (downtown Zemun terminus) *TC Novi Beograd *Opština Novi Beograd (Novi Beograd Council) *Bulevar Umetnosti :(branch for Blok 41 maintenance centre and depot, and Bulevar Umetnosti terminus) *Arena 1 (adjacent to the recently constructed Belgrade Arena) *Proleterske solidarnosti (interchange for Line 3 – Savska line) *Šest Kaplara :(crossing the Sava) *Varoš Kapija *Akademija (optional station, dependent on funding) *Trg Republike (Square of the Republic) *Trg Nikole Pašića (Nikola Pašić Square) *Pošta (Main post-office, connection with Faculty of Law station, interchange for Line 2 – Vračar line) *Vukov spomenik (interchange for Beovoz urban commuter services) *Đeram *Lion *Cvetkova pijaca *Olimp *Kluz *Ustanička St. (terminus) === Line 2 === Line 2 – Vračar line ( / Vračarska linija) would be sharing a station with Line 1 – The Faculty of Law/Pošta station. From here it would work its way to Slavija and Prokop (Belgrade's future Main train station) in deep-level tunnels. It would then proceed towards Belgrade Fair and Hipodrom. Its stations are expected to be: *Pravni fakultet (Faculty of Law terminus, interchange for Line 1 - Central line) *Slavija *Klinički centar *Prokop (interchange for Beovoz urban commuter services and Serbian Railways mainline intercity and international services) *Sajam (Belgrade Fair) *Hipodrom - Topčider (Topčider terminus) === Line 3 === Line 3 – Sava line ( / Savska linija) would depart from Novi Beograd where it's supposed to share the Proleterske solidarnosti station with Central line, headed for Novi Beograd mainline train station. Afterwards it would proceed across the Sava (in an, as yet, undetermined way, most like it will share a road bridge planned for constructions across the Ada) and would terminate at Banovo Brdo.

It launched on September 1, 1974, under the ownership of the Coopérative de Télévision de l'Outaouais (Outaouais Television Cooperative, CTVO). CFVO transmitted on channel 30, broadcasting mostly TVA network programming with various local shows; it was the first private French-language TV station in the Ottawa–Hull area and the first cooperatively owned television station in Canada. Constantly dogged by financial trouble, the station went bankrupt and ceased broadcasting on March 30, 1977. The channel 30 equipment was bought from bankruptcy by Radio-Québec (now Télé-Québec) and used to start CIVO-TV, the network's Outaouais transmitter; the CRTC awarded a new commercial station for the area in 1978, which became CHOT-TV (channel 40). ==Planning and application== On July 21, 1972, the Canadian Radio-Television Commission (CRTC) approved the granting of a licence to Global Communications Ltd. for a six-station regional television service in Ontario. That same day, the CRTC invited applications for English-language commercial television stations in Vancouver, Edmonton and Winnipeg and for a French-language commercial station in the Ottawa–Hull area, with a deadline of December 31, 1972. While the English-language outlets in western Canada would be the second private commercial outlet in those areas, there was no existing French-language commercial facility in the National Capital Region. In late July, the first bid for the French-language station was made by a new group, the Coopérative de Télévision de l'Outaouais (Outaouais Television Cooperative, CTVO), led by Gilles Poulin. That April, a conference in Hull to study French-language media on the Quebec–Ontario border had produced a group tasked with investigating the potential to establish a cooperative media outlet, settling on television. After making its bid, the new cooperative, which set up temporary offices in Hull, sought to raise $1 million by selling $10 shares in what would be the first cooperatively owned television station in Canada; all but one of its members were francophone. While CTVO raised funds, other potential bidders for the channel began to make themselves known. In September, it was reported that the owner of a Hull construction company had expressed interest. By the time the CRTC slated a public hearing in Ottawa, however, there were three applications for channel 30: CTVO; Corporation Civitas Ltee., a subsidiary of the Radiomutuel radio network; and Télé-Métropole, owner of CFTM-TV channel 10 in Montreal. The CTVO application specified that the cooperative would be led by a 15-member board of directors. CTVO also divided the Outaouais region into ten zones that would each design and produce programming and promised that 20 percent of its output would be locally produced. The cooperative made a strong positive impression at the public hearing: many of the more than 150 attendees, including unionist Yvon Charbonneau, wore yellow CTVO stickers, and more than a dozen area organizations made statements in support of the bid. In total, 25 oral and 60 written submissions backed the CTVO proposal. Competing applicant Civitas warned that the funds raised would not be sufficient to buy equipment: its president, Raymond Crepeault, forewarned of \\"the very serious danger of financial stability\\" and described the CTVO local programming plan as a \\"tower of Babel\\". ==Construction== On August 3, 1973, the CRTC selected the CTVO application and approved Canada's first cooperative television venture. In granting the licence, the CRTC stipulated that the CTVO station begin broadcasting by October 1, 1974, and be affiliated with the TVA network; additionally, it required the board of directors to be composed equally of residents of Ontario and Quebec. The cooperative continued to sell shares, boasting that 1974 was \\"The Year of CTVO\\" in a newspaper ad. Among those involved in setting up the station was future Quebec Premier Pauline Marois. Construction activities received a boost in March when the station leased out in an unprofitable movie theatre on St. Joseph Boulevard—the former Our Lady of the Annunciation church—to serve as studios and offices; the building featured high ceilings and theatre equipment, though CTVO had to spend money to add air conditioning. It had sold $600,000 in shares and planned to seek $400,000 in bank loans as well as $1,400,000 in equipment financing. In April, the CRTC assigned channel 10 on local cable systems for carriage of the new CFVO-TV. The transmitter on the Ryan Tower at Camp Fortune was prepared to broadcast the first UHF television station in the province and for the region, though the studios would not be ready to produce local programs at launch. ==Sign-on and early financial turmoil== CFVO-TV signed on September 1, 1974, with a documentary on the events leading up to the creation of channel 30 and a 60-minute musical program produced at TVA in Montreal. By year's end, the station was airing five hours of local programming a week, and on January 1, 1975, it doubled that output level to ten hours. CFVO-TV productions ranged from the local morning show Epice Ca and weekly women's programming to a regular series on the cooperative movement. However, signs of financial trouble soon began to arise. In November, station head Poulin noted that rising costs and interest rates had put a temporary strain on CFVO-TV's budget—less than three months after signing on. Some shareholders worried that, before the expansion of local production, the station was too reliant on TVA programming and not living up to its promise of providing community programming. The new year of 1975 brought even more internal turmoil to channel 30\\\\. That January, the station's news staff was abruptly terminated, resulting in pickets and an appeal to CTVO's shareholders; Poulin said that production of Le Quotidien, CFVO's main newscast, was too expensive and the program allegedly attracted the smallest audience of any on its lineup. This came as CTVO employees were organizing under the aegis of the National Communications Federation trade union; meanwhile, zone councils complained that their projects were not being tended to at the station. By March, channel 30 had accumulated a deficit of $300,000. A Toronto-based investor pulled a $900,000 investment in the wake of the financial troubles at the Global network; a massive fundraising and shareholder drive saved the outlet from bankruptcy or a potential sale. It emerged from this financial crisis having laid off 36 of its 58 employees. CFVO began 1976 in much the same way it began 1975. On January 6, it announced the lay-off of 12 employees, slashing local output from 16 hours a week to hours and eliminating all of its local non- information shows. Reports circulated that Télé-Métropole was seeking to buy the station, while employees blamed Poulin and the board of directors for administrative inefficiencies, including significant overexpenditures in the travel and miscellaneous items budget lines. Two days later, Poulin resigned, claiming he was \\"tired\\" and in the face of demands by the unionized employees; the board refused to accept his resignation on the grounds that he was needed to negotiate a $300,000 loan for the cooperative. The cuts sparked new concerns that CFVO was becoming a mere repeater of TVA programming supplied by Télé-Metropole. At the station's licence renewal hearing in March, Poulin said that CTVO needed to raise $50,000 to survive; the CRTC worried that the group would sacrifice cooperative status in pursuit of financial stability. ==Cinérotique controversy== The 1976 licence renewal cycle put another aspect of CFVO programming under the spotlight: its airing of Cinérotique, a late- night showcase of erotic films, on Friday nights. The program had launched with the station in September 1974, and it was one of the station's most successful, attracting as much as half the Ottawa viewing audience in its time slot. During a hearing, CRTC member Jacques Hébert said that CFVO-TV was the only station in Canada—and may have been the only in North America—to show such movies. Meanwhile, before the Ontario government—which had set up a royal commission into violence in the media—Poulin admitted that most of the station's programs (though not the erotic films) were not screened before being broadcast. Additionally, CFVO was criticized for airing popular American crime shows, such as Hawaii Five-O and Kojak, that were purchased by Télé- Métropole. Demands for Cinérotique to be canceled came from Bishop Adolphe Proulx and from the Caisse Populaire St. Joseph—one of several backers of a new fund drive for the station. The controversy prompted CFVO to stop airing the movies after June 11, 1976. The penultimate showing was preempted when the station rejected a film it found too hardcore for broadcast. Before the program ended, however, channel 30's broadcasts led to a court case in Ontario. After members of the Ottawa Police Service's morality squad seized films from the station in May, CFVO was charged in June with two counts, of unlawfully publishing and knowingly exposing to public view obscene moving pictures. The station fought the charges, claiming that Ontario police lacked jurisdiction over the Quebec-based outlet. In September, CFVO pleaded not guilty and stated it would not take any action to restore the program until after the trial, which would not start until January 1977. However, in December, it announced it would start a similar but softer program, Cine- Vendredi (Friday Night Movies), in light of its financial difficulties. The cooperative attempted to have the trial moved to Sudbury, the only bilingual court district in the province of Ontario; when a judge denied that motion, the station refused to mount a defence in an English-language courtroom in Ottawa. In testimony, the distributor of the movies called them \\"sex films\\" and said he expected the station to do its own censoring. The court ruled against CFVO-TV and fined it $1,000 at the conclusion of the trial. ==Closure== Amidst the Cinérotique court fight, station management continued to be optimistic about CFVO-TV's financial picture, despite being $500,000 in debt. The station had secured a new program exchange agreement to air educational fare from province-owned Radio-Québec, though local programming plans remained slim in light of their associated costs. However, in the second half of 1976, conditions worsened. By year's end, Pierre Thibault of Radio- Nord's CKRN-TV in Rouyn-Noranda had been dispatched to Hull to try and turn around the ailing cooperative station; Poulin had resigned, and the CRTC had suggested that CTVO hire someone from Radio-Nord or Télé-Métropole to assist. In January, CTVO worked to negotiate loans from credit unions (caisses populaires) in Hull and Montreal. The station had not paid its utility bills, was six months behind on rent, and could not repair any equipment that broke down. While the Union Regionale de Montreal des Caisses Populaires agreed to support the station, it refused to make a financial commitment until it had audited CTVO's books. Interim manager Thibault warned that the station was running out of time as sponsors were afraid to buy advertising time on a station with an uncertain future. A temporary director of shareholder services issued a plan that suggested a return to cooperative ways for CFVO-TV, which had become \\"a co-operation acting like a corporation\\". On February 24, the Union Regionale announced that it would loan CTVO $700,000, on the condition that CFVO reach an agreement with its creditors under which they would receive a portion of the money they were owed. A meeting with creditors was slated for March 29 by the appointed trustee. Even as one lender held out hope, another froze the business out. Banque Canadienne Nationale froze $400,000 in credit on March 10, leaving 50 CFVO-TV employees unpaid; entreaties were made with the provincial government for funding. At the meeting on March 29, CTVO was unable to convince a majority of the 198 creditors, collectively owed about $2 million, to approve its repayment proposal of 10 cents on the dollar. While talks continued, the station signed off that night with news of its bankruptcy and one last plea for donations. It was not to be. After employees spent much of the day clearing out their personal belongings, CFVO-TV signed off for the final time at 3 p.m. on March 30, airing the same Bonne Nuit (Good Night) slide that it showed at the close of programming each night. Fifteen minutes later, Hydro-Québec shut off the electricity to the St. Joseph's Boulevard studios. The station's employees slammed the Parti Québécois-led provincial government for not doing enough to save CFVO. On March 31, some 20 employees picketed the office of MNA Jocelyne Ouellette in protest. A small group of shareholders mounted a last-ditch effort in late April to revive the station, but the effort failed when the caisses populaires refused to finance it. ==After CFVO-TV== On April 5, 1977, Radio-Québec announced that it was submitting to the bankruptcy trustee in Montreal a bid to buy the assets of CFVO-TV in order to expand its broadcast coverage to the Outaouais area. On the April 21, it announced that it had purchased the equipment directly from the creditors, bypassing the cooperative; the $545,000 acquisition represented half of the outlay that would have been necessary to commission a transmitter from the ground up. Radio-Québec already had a production crew in the Ottawa area and did not need to hire CFVO's former employees. News of Radio-Québec's interest came as several groups were also readying plans for a new French- language commercial station in the National Capital Region. While channel 30 was broadcasting, a group of businessmen operating as Innovacom applied to the CRTC for a permit of its own. On June 30, the CRTC revoked CFVO-TV's licence, issued a licence to Radio-Québec to carry on a television station on channel 30 at Hull with the same technical parameters as the defunct CFVO-TV, and announced it would take applications to licence a new TVA affiliate for the region. CIVO-TV began broadcasting on August 15, 1977. Though as many as four bids were rumoured to be incoming for the TVA affiliate, the CRTC only received two, from Télé-Métropole and Radio-Nord. The CRTC selected the application from Radio-Nord to telecast on channel 40 in December; CHOT-TV began operations on October 27, 1978. Thibault served as its first general manager. Poulin joined Radio-Nord in 1977 and was promoted to executive vice president in 1980 and president in 1987. He also served on the board of directors of the TVA television network. Poulin left the company in 2001. ==References== ==External links== * FVO FVO FVO Category:Television channels and stations established in 1974 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1977 Category:1974 establishments in Quebec Category:1977 disestablishments in Quebec FVO-TV Category:Media cooperatives in Canada ","title":"CFVO-TV"},{"id":"9082285","text":"The Shining is the fourth album by Long Beach, California rapper RBX. == Track listing == ==Sources== [ AllMusic link] Discogs link Category:RBX albums Category:G-funk albums Category:2005 albums ","title":"The Shining (RBX album)"},{"id":"9082291","text":"Jaime Navarro Cintrón (born March 27, 1967 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico ) is a former Puerto Rican baseball player and current pitching coach for the Uni- President Lions for the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan. Navarro was a 6-foot, 4-inch tall right-handed pitcher in the major leagues from to , playing for the Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, and Cleveland Indians. He is the son of former Major League Baseball pitcher Julio Navarro. ==Baseball careerEarly years=== After graduating from Luis Pales Matos High School in Santa Rosa, Puerto Rico, Navarro was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 2nd round of the January amateur draft, but did not sign. On June 2, 1986, Navarro was drafted again by the Orioles in the 2nd round, but he still did not sign. Exactly a year later, in the June amateur draft, Navarro was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers as the 71st overall pick in the third round, and he signed with the team two days later. Navarro spent the rest of the season and the following two seasons playing in the Brewers minor league system, working his way up from rookie-level ball with the Helena Brewers to Triple-A (AAA) ball with the Denver Zephyrs. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== Only weeks into the minor league baseball season, Navarro was called up to the majors. He made his debut on June 20, , starting in front a crowd of 17,185 fans at County Stadium in a pitching duel against the Kansas City Royals' Charlie Leibrandt. Navarro tossed six innings of quality baseball, giving up eight hits and one earned run, while walking two and striking out two. Leibrandt pitched equally well and the game was ultimately decided by each team's relief pitchers. Brewers pitcher Mark Knudson gave up six runs in the 11th inning, and cost Navarro his first major league win. Navarro eventually picked up his first major league win five days later in a 3–1 victory against pitcher Jerry Reuss and the Chicago White Sox at home. Navarro continued as Brewers starting pitcher for the rest of the season, pitching in a total of nineteen games during the season. He posted a 7–8 record, with a 3.12 earned run average, 56 strikeouts, and a complete game on September 26. The following season, Navarro was sent back to the Class-AAA ball with the Denver Zephyrs. Navarro was called up to the majors after a starting the season in the minors, and he spent the rest of the season as a starter/reliever for the Brewers. The Brewers took note of Navarro's skill, and the 24-year-old was one of the team's five starting pitchers for the following season. In his first full season as a starter, Navarro posted a 15–12 record and a 3.92 earned run average. He also had ten complete games, two shutouts, and 114 strikeouts. Navarro had an even better season the following year, finishing with a 17–11 record, a 3.33 ERA and 100 strikeouts. However, the following two seasons proved disastrous for Navarro, as he gave up a league-high and Brewers team record 127 earned runs and 254 hits in 214.1 innings of work. With an 11–12 record and a 5.33 ERA in , the Brewers decided to split Navarro between starting and relieving jobs for the season. In his first start of the season, on April 11, 1994, Navarro was the winning pitcher for the inaugural Texas Rangers baseball game at The Ballpark in Arlington. Through the season, Navarro showed no sign of improvement, finishing the season with a 4–9 record and 6.62 ERA. Left with few options, the Brewers granted Navarro free agency on April 7, .  Two days after being granted free agency, Navarro signed with the Chicago Cubs. Navarro started in 29 games for the Cubs that year, and posted much-improved numbers on the season. He led the team in many pitching categories that year, such as wins and innings pitched. Navarro was granted free agency on November 1, but on December 8, , he accepted the Cubs' salary arbitration offer, and then agreed to a $3.4 million contract for the season. Navarro led the team again in 1996 with a 15–12 record, 3.92 earned run average, four complete games and 158 strikeouts. Oddly enough, Navarro also led the league in batters faced and hits allowed. On October 28, , Navarro was again granted free agency by the Cubs and he signed to a four-year, $20 million contract with the crosstown rivals of the Cubs, the White Sox, on December 11. ===White Sox=== The three years (–) that Navarro spent with the White Sox were far from a success. Along with a lowly 9–14 record and a 5.79 ERA, Navarro led the league in wild pitches, hits allowed, earned runs allowed in . One of the only highlights of the 1997 season was the surprising dominance Navarro had against the Boston Red Sox. Most memorable is a 10–1 victory against the team on May 20, which gave Navarro his 10th straight win against the Red Sox, dating back to September 28, . The season was just as disappointing for Navarro, as he finished with a dismal 8–16 record and 6.36 ERA, and led the league in wild pitches and losses. Navarro showed no improvement the following year either, and the White Sox traded Navarro and fellow pitcher John Snyder to the Brewers for pitcher Cal Eldred and infielder José Valentín. ===AAA baseball=== Navarro became another addition to the starting rotation of the Brewers for the beginning of the 2000 season. In five starts with the team, he only pitched 18.7 innings, posted an 0–5 record, gave up eighteen walks, and had an ERA of 12.54. Less than a month into the season, the Brewers released him. Sixteen days later, he was signed as a free agent by the Colorado Rockies. The Rockies sent Navarro back down to Triple-A baseball with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the Pacific Coast League. He showed some improvement in Triple-A, but he was released by the Rockies a month after being signed by the team. The next day, the Cleveland Indians picked up Navarro as a free agent, and he agreed to be sent back down to AAA ball with the Buffalo Bisons in the International League, after Indians manager Charlie Manuel suggested he learn to be a reliever. He was later called up to the big leagues in a role as a starter/reliever, and he did not fare well in his return to the big leagues. This was the last time he played in the major leagues, as Navarro was later designated for assignment to clear up space on the Indians' 40-man roster. He played with the Bisons for the remainder of the season before being granted free agency by the Indians on October 2. He was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays on December 13, and subsequently released on March 11, . Nearly a year later, on January 31, , the St. Louis Cardinals agreed to terms on a minor league contract with Navarro and assigned him to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League. More than a year later, Navarro signed with the Cincinnati Reds to play for the Triple-A Louisville Bats of the International League. Navarro looked much better after only giving up three earned runs in ten innings of work in two starts for Louisville. However, he was released by the Reds on June 6, . Later, he played with the unaffiliated Newark Bears of the Atlantic League as a starting pitcher. After his stint with the Bears, Navarro did not play professional baseball in the U.S again. ===Italian baseball=== Navarro spent three years pitching in Italy for Bbc Grosseto of the Italian Baseball League. His 18 wins and 1.76 ERA helped his team win the 2004 Italian League and play in the European Champions League, which Grosseto won in 2005 and Navarro was named MVP. In the early months of the 2005 season, Navarro had a serious bike accident that cost him the rest of the season, but he managed to come back for the 2006 season, finishing 9–7 with a 2.03 ERA. ===Coaching career=== Days after the 2006 season's finale, he had a rough discussion with Grosseto management and decided not to pitch again in Italy. In , he was the pitching coach for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League. On January 13, , he was named the pitching coach for the Single-A High Desert Mavericks. After the '09 season Navarro was named as the pitching coach for the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Navarro was the Mariners bullpen coach from 2011-13. Navarro was released by the Seattle Mariners organization, along with 9 other coaches, after the 2015 season. From 2016-2019 Navarro was the pitching coach for Pericos of Puebla and Acereros of Monclova for the Mexican Baseball League. ===Record=== The Navarros (Jaime and his father Julio) were the first father and son to each record a major league save. They were followed by Pedro Borbón and Pedro Borbón, Jr.; Steve Grilli and Jason Grilli; and Jeff Russell and James Russell. In 2014 Navarro was inducted in the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico * List of second-generation Major League Baseball players ==References== ==External links== , or Baseball Library, or Retrosheet, or Mexican League Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball) players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Denver Zephyrs players Category:El Paso Diablos players Category:Grosseto Baseball Club players Category:Guerreros de Oaxaca players Category:Helena Brewers players Category:Lobos de Arecibo players Category:Louisville Bats players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Miami Dade Sharks baseball players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:Newark Bears players Category:People from Bayamón, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Seattle Mariners coaches Category:Stockton Ports players ","title":"Jaime Navarro"},{"id":"9082321","text":"Kristian House (born 6 October 1979 in Canterbury, England)Profile on velobios.co is a British former racing cyclist who rode for the team from 2008 to 2015, and joined in 2016.

Robinson, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and, in the title role, rising newcomer Wayne Morris. It was scripted by Seton I. Miller and directed by Michael Curtiz. It was remade in 1941, this time in a circus setting, as The Wagons Roll at Night, also with Bogart, and in 1962 as an Elvis Presley musical. The original version was re- titled The Battling Bellhop for television distribution in order to avoid confusion with the Presley remake. ==Plot== In Florida, boxing promoter Nick Donati (Edward G. Robinson) gets doublecrossed by his boxer, who throws a fight for a $25,000 bribe from gangster Turkey Morgan (Humphrey Bogart). Nick and his girlfriend \\"Fluff\\" (Bette Davis) decide to throw a wild, days-long party with the money they have left, before looking for a new boxing prospect. Nick orders naive young farmer turned hotel bellhop Ward Guisenberry (Wayne Morris) to mix some drinks, but he does not know how, as he does not drink. Fluff kindly helps him out. When Morgan, underling Buzz Barret (Ben Welden), and Chuck McGraw (William Haade), his fighter and new heavyweight champion, arrive uninvited, Ward does not like it when the somewhat drunk McGraw pushes Fluff, so he punches him, knocking him to the ground. Nick is impressed, and persuades him to try boxing. For his first bout, Ward is up against McGraw's experienced brother. Much to everyone's surprise, he wins by knockout. To protect him from Morgan's wrath, Nick sends him, Fluff and ringside assistant Silver Jackson (Harry Carey) to New York City by train. However, Morgan is waiting outside their usual hotel. He tries to get Ward to sign with him, but Ward knocks him down, insisting he will only sign with Nick. Desperate, Fluff decides to hide the handsome young man at Nick's mother's farm. There he meets Nick's sister, Marie (Jane Bryan), fresh from a convent education. They clash. When Nick finds out, he is furious. He does not want his family to have anything to do with boxing. He takes Ward back to the city. Ward, rechristened \\"Kid Galahad\\", wins a string of fights by knockout. He tells Fluff that his goal is to earn enough to buy a farm. Fluff falls for him, and is crushed when he confides to her that he is in love with Marie. She hides her disappointment, and with her encouragement, he drives up to tell Marie. It turns out that she is just as much in love with him. Fluff leaves Nick, confessing to him that she loves Ward and cannot bear to be around the young man. She gets a job singing in a nightclub. In Ward's next fight, Nick orders him to just box and win on points, as knocking his opponent out would build public pressure to fight the champ too soon; Nick wants more time to train his fighter. However, Morgan tells his foe what to say to infuriate Ward. As a result, Ward wins by knockout. Marie sees the fight; afterward they go out on the town. When she asks to see Fluff, Ward takes her to the nightclub. By coincidence, McGraw is in a private room there, drunk and with a couple of girls. When Morgan shows up to get him, McGraw spots Ward and pushes him to the floor. The two are separated, but Ward offers to fight within the month. Newspaper photographers take pictures of Ward with both Marie and Fluff. As a result, Nick finally learns that Ward has been seeing his sister. Infuriated, Nick secretly turns on his boxer, agreeing to a title bout. He orders Ward to come out slugging, knowing it is a losing strategy. When Morgan discovers that Nick has placed substantial bets against his own fighter, he visits Nick. He learns that Nick wants to get back at Ward, and decides to bet $150,000 himself. During the bout, Ward faithfully follows Nick's orders and is knocked down repeatedly by McGraw. Fluff and Marie attend the fight together. When Fluff realizes what Nick is doing, she and Marie plead with him to stop. Nick finally comes to his senses and changes tactics. In the end, Ward knocks McGraw out and becomes world heavyweight champion. After the fight, an armed Morgan arranges to be alone in the changing room with Nick, Ward and Silver. Nick is prepared though, and also has a gun. They exchange shots, fatal on both sides. Before he dies, Nick gives his blessing to Ward and Marie. ==Cast== * Edward G.

After a number of games for Worcestershire's Second XI in the previous two seasons, Ellis made his only appearance for the England Under-19 team in April 1995, in a minor match against Somerset's second team. In a huge 309-run win, Ellis acquitted himself well with the bat, making 45 and 25 not out, but a match bowling analysis of 16-4-81-0 was considerably worse than that of his bowling team-mates, and he never again played for an England team at any level. In June 1995 Ellis made his first- class debut, for Combined Universities against the West Indians. Although the tourists' first-innings 637/5 declared ensured that there was no chance of a win for the students (in fact the game was drawn) Ellis took 5-59 in the second innings, which remained the only five-wicket haul of his career. His first victim in first-class cricket was Stuart Williams. After one game for British Universities in the 1996 Benson & Hedges Cup, Ellis made his senior Worcestershire debut against Glamorgan in the NatWest Trophy in late June. He was not much of a success, his seven overs bringing only two tail-end wickets for the cost of 34 runs, but two days later he was given a County Championship debut against Yorkshire and took three wickets in the game, including those of Michael Vaughan and Michael Bevan. Ellis retained his place in the side until the end of the season, but was expensive, his 14 first-class wickets coming at 49.00, though he did a little better in one-day cricket. Ellis played no first-team cricket the following summer, and was diagnosed with three stress fractures in his back at the end of the season. In 1998 he was selected only twice. His only wicket that season, and indeed his last for Worcestershire, was that of Oxford University's Joseph Parker. At the end of 1998 he left the county and played in the Minor Counties Championship (and once in the NatWest Trophy) for Shropshire, as well as making appearances for the Second XIs of both Middlesex, taking nine wickets in a game against Warwickshire, and Nottinghamshire. In 2001 he played two C&G; Trophy games for the Worcestershire Cricket Board XI, his last List A wicket coming when he dismissed Steven Knox of Cumberland. ==External links== * * Statistical summary from CricketArchive Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Shropshire cricketers Category:Worcestershire Cricket Board cricketers Category:British Universities cricketers ","title":"Scott Ellis (cricketer)"},{"id":"9082381","text":"OCAC may refer to: * Overseas Chinese Affairs Council * Oklahoma Collegiate Athletic Conference * Ontario Coalition for Abortion Clinics * Oregon College of Art & Craft * Organization of Central Asian Cooperation * Oxford City Athletic Club *Odisha Computer Application Centre ","title":"OCAC"},{"id":"9082427","text":"\\"Sleep Walk\\" is an instrumental tune written, recorded, and released in 1959 by brothers Santo & Johnny Farina, with their uncle Mike Dee playing the drums. Prominently featuring steel guitar, the song was recorded at Trinity Music in Manhattan, New York City. \\"Sleep Walk\\" entered Billboard's Top 40 on August 17, 1959. It rose to the number 1 position for the last two weeks in September and remained in the Top 40 until November 9. \\"Sleep Walk\\" also reached number 4 on the R&B; chart. It was the last instrumental to hit number 1 in the 1950s and earned a gold record for Santo and Johnny. In the UK it peaked at number 22 on the charts. == Background and recording == As children, both Santo and Johnny Farina were encouraged by their father, Tony, to learn the steel guitar and write their own music. This music would be recorded on a Webcor tape recorder their father had bought for them. Unable to fall asleep one night after a gig, the Farina brothers decided to write some music, using the tape recorder to first record the harmonies to what would become \\"Sleep Walk\\". After adding and finalizing the steel guitar melody, Johnny Farina believed they had a hit song, so he spent a year and a half talking with various music publishers about the possibility of professionally recording \\"Sleep Walk\\". The \\"Sleep Walk\\" demo made a positive impression on Ed Burton of Trinity Music. After ultimately signing with Canadian-American Records, the brothers recorded \\"Sleep Walk\\" at Trinity Music, using a triple-neck Fender Stringmaster on the recording. == Release == \\"Sleep Walk\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 on July 27, 1959. Announced on the radio by disc jockey Alan Freed, the instrumental rose in popularity until it became the number 1 single for the last two weeks of September of that year. After losing the position to Bobby Darin's recording of \\"Mack the Knife\\", the song remained on Billboard's Top 40 until November 1959. ==Chart performanceAll-time charts=== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !

The Brian Setzer Orchestra recording of \\"Sleep Walk\\" received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance of 1998. \\"Sleep Walk\\" was a principal inspiration to Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green for his 1968 instrumental \\"Albatross\\", which became a worldwide hit. \\"Albatross\\" in turn inspired the Beatles song \\"Sun King\\" from Abbey Road. Larry Carlton covered the song on his 1982 album, Sleepwalk. The song \\"Sleepwalking (Couples Only Dance Prom Night)\\" by the band Modest Mouse, from their 1996 EP Interstate 8, drew inspiration from \\"Sleep Walk\\" in its melody, with the main addition to the original being added vocals/lyrics. Deftones included \\"Sleep Walk\\" on their 2011 album Covers which is a compilation album of cover songs. ==Sleepwalkers== The song inspired Stephen King to write his first screenplay, for the 1992 horror film Sleepwalkers.

He represented Great Britain at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, finishing 61st in the road race. Stephens finished 8th in the Amateur World Road Race Championships in 1995, forming part of a break on the second lap of the race alongside eventual winner Danny Nelissen and earning Team GB their squad for the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 (automatic qualification for the Games was restricted to nations with finishers in the top 15 of the 1995 World Championships). However, he was not selected for the Olympic Road Race team that year, causing some uproar amongst fans of the sport. He became the British National Road Race Champion in 1998. After this he turned professional with the British- based Harrods team in 1998, before riding for the Linda McCartney Racing Team in 1999 until their demise in February 2001. During the 2000 3-week Giro d'Italia race he battled through with injuries from a fall, earning media admiration. He rode for Sigma Sport between 2001 and 2011, acting as rider/manager from 2010 onwards.

Leonardo has long been regarded as the archetypal Renaissance man, described by the Renaissance biographer Giorgio Vasari as having qualities that \\"transcended nature\\" and being \\"marvellously endowed with beauty, grace and talent in abundance\\".Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Artists p. 254 Interest in and curiosity about Leonardo has continued unabated for five hundred years.Bortolon, Liana (1967). The Life and Times of Leonardo. London: Paul Hamlyn. Modern descriptions and analysis of Leonardo's character, personal desires and intimate behavior have been based upon various sources: records concerning him, his biographies, his own written journals, his paintings, his drawings, his associates, and commentaries that were made concerning him by contemporaries. ==Biography== Leonardo was born to unmarried parents on 15 April 1452, \\"at the third hour of the night\\"His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio, as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in Leonardo da Vinci, and Reynal & Co., Leonardo da Vinci (William Morrow and Company, 1956): \\"A grandson of mine was born April 15, Saturday, three hours into the night\\". The date was recorded in the Julian calendar; as it was Florentine time and sunset was 6:40 pm, three hours after sunset would be sometime around 9:40 pm which was still April 14 by modern reckoning. The conversion to the New Style calendar adds nine days; hence Leonardo was born April 23 according to the modern calendar. in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, in the lower valley of the Arno River in the territory of the Republic of Florence. He was the out-of-wedlock son of the wealthy Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci, a Florentine legal notary, and an orphaned girl, Caterina di Meo Lippi. His full birth name was \\"Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci\\", meaning \\"Leonardo, (son) of (Mes)ser Piero from Vinci\\". The inclusion of the title \\"ser\\" indicated that Leonardo's father was a gentleman. Leonardo's childhood home in Anchiano Leonardo spent his first five years in the hamlet of Anchiano in the home of his mother, then from 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle, Francesco, in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera; Ser Piero married four times and produced children by his two later marriages.Rosci, p. 20. Leonardo's seven brothers were later to argue with him over the distribution of his father's estate. At the age of about fourteen Leonardo was apprenticed by his father to the artist Andrea del Verrocchio. Leonardo was eventually to become a paid employee of Verrocchio's studio. During his time there, Leonardo met many of the most important artists to work in Florence in the late fifteenth century including Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Pietro Perugino. Leonardo helped Verrocchio paint The Baptism of Christ, completed around 1475. According to Vasari, Verrocchio, on seeing the beauty of the angel that his young pupil had painted, never painted again. Burial place of Leonardo da Vinci, in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert, Château d'Amboise, France Florence was at this time a Republic, but the city was increasingly under the influence of a single powerful family, the Medici, led by Lorenzo de' Medici, who came to be known as \\"Lorenzo the Magnificent\\". In 1481 Leonardo commenced an important commission, the painting of a large altarpiece for the church of San Donato in Scopeto. The work was never completed. Leonardo left Florence and travelled to Milan carrying a gift from Lorenzo to the regent ruler, Ludovico Sforza. He was employed by Ludovico from 1481 to 1499, during which time his most important works were the Virgin of the Rocks, the Last Supper and a huge model of a horse for an equestrian monument which was never completed. Other important events during this time were the arrival in his studio of the boy Salaì in 1490, and in 1491 the marriage of Ludovico Sforza to Beatrice d'Este, for which he organized the celebrations. When Milan was invaded by the French in 1499, Leonardo left and spent some time in Venice, and possibly Rome and Naples before returning to Florence.Martin Kemp, Leonardo seen from the inside out, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 255-274 In Florence, Leonardo lived at premises of the Servite Community, and at that time drew the large cartoon for the Madonna and Child and St Anne, which attracted a lot of popular attention. He is also reported to have had a job to do for King Louis XII of France. Between 1506 and 1513 Leonardo was once again based mostly in Milan. In 1507 Francesco Melzi joined his household as an apprentice, and remained with him until his death. In 1513 Leonardo left Milan for Rome and was employed by the Medici family. In 1516 he went to France as court painter to King Francis I. The king gave the chateau of Clos Lucé as his home and regarded him with great esteem. It is said that the king held Leonardo's head as he died. Leonardo is buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert adjacent to the Château d'Amboise in France. ==Character== Leonardo da Vinci was described by his early biographers as a man with great personal appeal, kindness, and generosity. He was generally well loved by his contemporaries. According to Vasari, \\"Leonardo's disposition was so lovable that he commanded everyone's affection\\". He was \\"a sparkling conversationalist\\" who charmed Ludovico Sforza with his wit. Vasari sums him up by saying: > ... his magnificent presence brought comfort to the most troubled soul; he > was so persuasive that he could bend other people to his will. ... He was so > generous that he fed all his friends, rich or poor... Through his birth > Florence received a very great gift, and through his death it sustained an > incalculable loss. Vasari also says: > In the normal course of events many men and women are born with various > remarkable qualities and talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends > nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace > and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind... Everyone > acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of > outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything he > did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he > studied were solved with ease. While painting The Last Supper, Leonado wrote, \\"Wine is good, but water is preferable at table. ... Small rooms or dwellings set the mind in the right path, large ones cause it to go astray. ... If you want money in abundance, you will end by not enjoying it.\\" He also wrote, \\"He who wishes to become rich in a day is hanged in a year.\\" Some of Leonardo's philosophies can be found in a series of fables he wrote for the court of Ludovico Sforza. These were presented as jests (labelled 'prophecies') in which he told a riddle and made his audience guess the title. Prevalent themes include the dangers of an inflated sense of self-worth, often as described in opposition to the benefits that one can gain through awareness, humility and endeavour. Leonardo also had a distinctive sense of humour, showing newfound friends a lizard he had decorated in scales, a horn and beard made from quicksilver to surprise them, and describing a practical joke in his Treatise on Painting: > If you want to make a fire which will set a hall in a blaze without injury, > do this: first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense or some other > odoriferous substance: it is a good trick to play. ... then go into the room > suddenly with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a blaze. ==Personal relationships== Little is known about Leonardo's intimate relationships from his own writing. Some evidence of Leonardo's personal relationships emerges both from historic records and from the writings of his many biographers. ===Pupils=== Leonardo maintained long-lasting relationships with two pupils who were apprenticed to him as children. These were Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, who entered his household in 1490 at the age of 10, and Count Francesco Melzi, the son of a Milanese aristocrat who was apprenticed to Leonardo by his father in 1506, at the age of 14, remaining with him until his death. Gian Giacomo was nicknamed Salaì or il Salaino meaning \\"the little devil\\". Vasari describes him as \\"a graceful and beautiful youth with fine curly hair\\". The \\"Little Devil\\" lived up to his nickname: a year after his entering the household Leonardo made a list of the boy’s misdemeanours, calling him \\"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton\\". But despite Salaì's thievery and general delinquency—he made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions, spent a fortune on apparel, including twenty-four pairs of shoes, and eventually died in a duel—he remained Leonardo's servant and assistant for thirty years. At Leonardo's death he was bequeathed the Mona Lisa, a valuable piece even then, valued in Salaì's own will at the equivalent of £200,000. Melzi accompanied Leonardo in his final days in France. On Leonardo's death he wrote a letter to inform Leonardo's brothers, describing him as \\"like an excellent father to me\\" and goes on to say: \\"Everyone is grieved at the loss of such a man that Nature no longer has it in her power to produce.\\"Martin Kemp, Leonardo seen from the inside out, Oxford University Press, (2004) Melzi subsequently played an important role as the guardian of Leonardo's notebooks, preparing them for publication in the form directed by the master. He was not to see this project fully realized, but gathered the Codex Urbinas. ===Sexuality=== Little is self-revealed about Leonardo's sexuality, as, although he left hundreds of pages of writing, very little of it is personal in nature. He left no letters, poetry or diary that indicate any romantic interest. He never married and it cannot be stated with certainty that he had a sexually intimate relationship with any person, male or female. One of the few references that Leonardo made to sexuality in his notebooks states: \\"The act of procreation and anything that has any relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there were no pretty faces and sensuous dispositions.\\"Sigmund Freud: Leonardo da Vinci, translated by Abraham Brill, 1916, chapter I. bartleby.com, after Edmondo Solmi: Leonardo da Vinci. German Translation by Emmi Hirschberg. Berlin, 1908, p. 24 books.google. In Edmondo Solmi: Leonardo (1452-1519), 2nd ed., Firenze G. Barbéra 1907, p. 21 archive.org, the quote reads: « L' atto del coito e le membra a quello adoprate, scriverà Leonardo con ardita espressione, son di tanta bruttura, che, se non fusse la bellezza de' volti e li ornamenti delli opranti e la sfrenata disposizione, la natura perderebbe la spezie umana. » The source is given as W[indsor]. An[atomical manuscript]. A. 8v, p. 227 archive.org, = the vertebral column RL 19007v, cf. Martin Clayton (2010) p. 158 books.google This statement has been the subject of various extrapolations and interpretations in attempts to gain a picture of his sexuality. He also wrote \\"Intellectual passion drives out sensuality. ... Whoso curbs not lustful desires puts himself on a level with the beasts.\\" The only historical document concerning Leonardo's sexual life is an accusation of sodomy made in 1476, while he was still at the workshop of Verrocchio.Caravaggio and his two cardinals Creighton Gilbert, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio; p. 303 N96. Florentine court records show that on April9, 1476, an anonymous denunciation was left in the tamburo (letter box) in the Palazzo della Signoria (town hall) accusing a young goldsmith and male prostitute, Jacopo Saltarelli (sometimes referred to as an artist's model) of being \\"party to many wretched affairs and consents to please those persons who request such wickedness of him\\". The denunciation accused four people of sodomizing Saltarelli: Leonardo da Vinci, a tailor named Baccino, Bartolomeo di Pasquino, and Leonardo Tornabuoni, a member of the aristocratic Tornabuoni family. Saltarelli's name was known to the authorities because another man had been convicted of sodomy with him earlier the same year.Crompton, p. 265 Charges against the five were dismissed on the condition that no further accusations appear in the tamburo. The same accusation did in fact appear on June 7, but charges were again dismissed.Wittkower and Wittkower, pp. 170—71 The charges were dismissed because the accusations did not meet the legal requirement for prosecution: all accusations of sodomy had to be signed, but this one was not. (Such accusations could be made secretly, but not anonymously.) There is speculation that since the family of one of the accused, Leonardo Tornabuoni, was associated with Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.Saslow, Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in Art and Society, 1986, p. 197. Sodomy was theoretically an extremely serious offense, carrying the death penalty, but its very seriousness made it equally difficult to prove. It was also an offence for which punishment was very seldom handed down in contemporary Florence, where homosexuality was sufficiently widespread and tolerated to make the word Florenzer (Florentine) slang for homosexual in Germany. A comedic illustration made in 1495 for a poem by Gaspare Visconti may depict Leonardo as a court lawyer with allusions to his alleged homosexual proclivities. Michael White points out that willingness to discuss aspects of Leonardo's sexual identity has varied according to contemporary attitudes. His near-contemporary biographer Vasari makes no reference to Leonardo's sexuality whatsoever. In the 20th century, biographers made explicit references to a probability that Leonardo was homosexual, though others concluded that for much of his life he was celibate. Elizabeth Abbott, in her History of Celibacy, contends that, although Leonardo was probably homosexual, the trauma of the sodomy case converted him to celibacy for the rest of his life. A similar view of a homosexually inclined but chaste Leonardo appears in a famous 1910 paper by Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood, which analysed a memory Leonardo described of having been attacked as a baby by a bird of prey that opened his mouth and \\"stuck me with the tail inside my lips again and again\\". Freud claimed the symbolism was clearly phallic, but argued that Leonardo's homosexuality was latent, and that he did not act on his desires. However, Freud's premise was based on an erroneous translation of the bird as a vulture, leading him in the direction of Egyptian mythology, when it was actually a kite in Leonardo's story. Other authors contend that Leonardo was actively homosexual. Serge Bramly states that \\"the fact that Leonardo warns against lustfulness certainly need not mean that he himself was chaste\\". David M. Friedman argues that Leonardo's notebooks show a preoccupation with men and with sexuality uninterrupted by the trial and agrees with art historian Kenneth Clark that Leonardo never became sexless. Michael White, in Leonardo: The First Scientist, says it is likely that the trial simply made Leonardo cautious and defensive about his personal relationships and sexuality, but did not dissuade him from intimate relationships with men: \\"there is little doubt that Leonardo remained a practising homosexual\\". Leonardo's late painting of Saint John the Baptist is often cited as support of the case that Leonardo was homosexual. There is also an erotic drawing of Salaì known as The Incarnate Angel, perhaps by the hand of Leonardo, which was one of a number of such drawings once among those contained in the British Royal Collection, but later dispersed. The particular drawing, showing an angel with an erect phallus, was rediscovered in a German collection in 1991. It appears to be a humorous take on Leonardo's St. John the Baptist.Sewell, Brian. Sunday Telegraph, April 5, 1992. The painting of John the Baptist was copied by several of Leonardo's followers, including Salaì. The drawing may also be by one of Leonardo's pupils, perhaps Salaì himself, as it appears to have been drawn by the right, rather than the left hand, and bears strong resemblance to Salaì's copy of the painting. ===Patrons, friends and colleagues=== Leonardo da Vinci had a number of powerful patrons, including the King of France. He had, over the years, a large number of followers and pupils. Francis I receiving the last breath of Leonardo da Vinci, by Ingres, 1818 *His patrons included the Medici, Ludovico Sforza and Cesare Borgia, in whose service he spent the years 1502 and 1503, and King Francis I of France. *He had working relations with two other notable scientists, Luca Pacioli and Marcantonio della Torre, and also collaborated with Niccolò Machiavelli. *He had a close, long-lasting friendship with Isabella d'Este, a renowned patroness of the arts, whose portrait he drew while on a journey that took him through Mantua. *The de Predis brothers and collaboration on Virgin of the Rocks. *His relationship with Michelangelo (23 years his junior) was always tense and ambivalent, as the two had such contrasting characters. ==Interests== Vasari says of the child Leonardo \\"He would have been very proficient in his early lessons, if he had not been so volatile and flexible; for he was always setting himself to learn a multitude of things, most of which were shortly abandoned. When he began the study of arithmetic, he made, within a few months, such remarkable progress that he could baffle his master with the questions and problems that he raised... All the time, through all his other enterprises, Leonardo never ceased drawing...\\" The Baptism of Christ Leonardo's father, Ser Piero, realising that his son's talents were extraordinary, took some of his drawings to show his friend, Andrea del Verrocchio, who ran one of the largest artists' workshops in Florence. Leonardo was accepted for apprenticeship and \\"soon proved himself a first class geometrician\\". Vasari says that during his youth Leonardo made a number of clay heads of smiling women and children from which casts were still being made and sold by the workshop some 80 years later. Among his earliest significant known paintings are the Annunciation in the Uffizi, the angel that he painted as a collaboration with Verrocchio in The Baptism of Christ, and a small predella of the Annunciation to go beneath an altarpiece by Lorenzo di Credi. The little predella picture is probably the earliest. The diversity of Leonardo's interests, remarked on by Vasari as apparent in his early childhood, was to express itself in his journals which record his scientific observations of nature, his meticulous dissection of corpses to understand anatomy, his experiments with machines for flying, for generating power from water and for besieging cities, his studies of geometry and his architectural plans, as well as personal memos and creative writing including fables. ===Philosophy and religion=== There is not much firsthand information about Leonardo's religious inclination, but most historians have deemed him as a Roman Catholic. Leonardo was not a particularly devout man, but referred to God as a kind of supreme being. Leonardo could be described as a spiritual metaphysician, who was interested in Greek philosophy such as that of Plato and Aristotle. He describes friars as the \\"fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration\\" and calls books such as the Bible \\"supreme truth\\", while also jesting that \\"Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of the Mother.\\" He argues against the myth of a universal flood (as in the story of Noah), doubting that so much water could have evaporated away from the Earth. In an early example of ichnology, he explains that the fossils of marine shells would have been scattered in such a deluge, and not gathered in groups, which were in fact left at various times on mountains in Lombardy. He discredits pagan mythology as well, saying that gods the size of planets would appear as mere specks of light in the universe—also calling these personifications \\"mortal ... putrid and corrupt in their sepulchers.\\" ===Résumé=== Leonardo sent the following letter to Ludovico Sforza, the ruler of Milan, in 1482: ===Musical ability=== It appears from Vasari's description that Leonardo first learned to play the lyre as a child and that he was very talented at improvisation. In about 1479 he created a lyre in the shape of a horse's head, which was made \\"mostly of silver\\", and of \\"sonorous and resonant\\" tone. Lorenzo de' Medici saw this lyre and wishing to better his relationship with Ludovico Sforza, the usurping Duke of Milan, he sent Leonardo to present this lyre to the Duke as a gift. Leonardo's musical performances so far surpassed those of Ludovico's court musicians that the Duke was delighted. ===Love of nature=== Leonardo always loved nature. One of the reasons was because of his childhood environment. Near his childhood house were mountains, trees, and rivers. There were also many animals. This environment gave him the perfect chance to study the surrounding area; it also may have encouraged him to have interest in painting. Later in life he recalls his exploration of an ominous cavern in the mountains as formative. ===Vegetarianism=== Leonardo's love of animals has been documented both in contemporary accounts as recorded in early biographies, and in his notebooks. Remarkably for the period, he even questioned the morality of eating animals when it was not necessary for health. Statements from his notebook and a comment by a contemporary have led to the widely held view that he was vegetarian. Additionally, he categorized humans as being in the same set of species as apes and monkeys, just as he did with other animals in their respective genus. He also dissected dead animals for the purpose of comparative anatomy. Edward MacCurdy (one of the two translators and compilers of Leonardo's notebooks into English) wrote: Leonardo wrote the following in his notebooks, which were not deciphered and made available for reading until the 19th century: ===Weapons and war=== One might question Leonardo's concern for human life, given his weapon designs. Nothing came of his designs for offensive weapons.Robert Payne, Leonardo (1978) It is possible his mention of his capabilities of creating weapons helped him in his quest to find powerful patrons, or perhaps he was fond of drawing them as he was of gargoyles. He did work on fortifications, however. In his own words: He referred to war as pazzia bestialissima, the \\"most bestial madness\\". ==Physical characteristics== A statue of Leonardo outside the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, based upon contemporary descriptions Descriptions and portraits of Leonardo combine to create an image of a man who was tall for his time and place, athletic and extremely handsome. He may have been at least 5 ft 8in (173cm) tall, based on the length of his purported skeleton.Mrs. Charles W. Heaton (1874), Leonardo da Vinci and his works, Kessinger Publishing, Whitefish, MT, 2004, p. 204: \\"The skeleton, which measured five feet eight inches, accords with the height of Leonardo da Vinci. The skull might have served for the model of the portrait Leonardo drew of himself in red chalk a few years before his death. M. Robert Fleury, head master of the Fine Art School at Rome, has handled the skull with respect, and recognized in it the grand and simple outline of this human yet divine head, which once held a world within its limits.\\" However, the remains, which were attributed to Leonardo due to the unusually large skull and accompanying stone fragments inscribed \\"EO [...] DUS VINC\\", have not yet been positively identified.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/05/05/leonardo-da-vinci- paintings-analysed-for-dna-to-solve-grave-myst/ Portraits indicate that as an older man, he wore his hair long, at a time when most men wore it cropped short, or reaching to the shoulders. While most men were shaven or wore close- cropped beards, Leonardo's beard flowed over his chest. His clothing is described as being unusual in his choice of bright colours, and at a time when most mature men wore long garments, Leonardo's preferred outfit was the short tunic and hose generally worn by younger men. This image of Leonardo has been recreated in the statue of him that stands outside the Uffizi Gallery. According to Vasari, Leonardo possessed \\"great strength and dexterity\\", being \\"physically so strong that he could withstand violence and with his right hand he could bend the ring of an iron door knocker or a horseshoe as if they were lead\\". He was \\"striking and handsome\\" and \\"marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace [and] outstanding physical beauty\\", and \\"displayed infinite grace in everything he did\\". Author Simon Hewitt claims that a figure in the Sforzida manuscript depicts a youthful Leonardo and that the figure in the illustration has red hair. ===Portraits=== Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk Leonardo's face is best known from a drawing in red chalk that appears to be a self-portrait. However, there is some controversy over the identity of the subject, because the man represented appears to be of a greater age than the 67 years lived by Leonardo. A solution which has been put forward is that Leonardo deliberately aged himself in the drawing, as a modern forensic artist might do, in order to provide a model for Raphael's painting of him as Plato in The School of Athens. A profile portrait in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan is generally accepted to be a portrait of Leonardo, and also depicts him with flowing beard and long hair. This image was repeated in the woodcut designed for the first edition of Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.Angela Otino della Chiesa, Leonardo da Vinci, Penguin, 1967, In a 2008 TED talk, artist Siegfried Woldhek, based on Leonardo's features allegedly featured in Andrea del Verrocchio's bronze statue of David, proposed that Leonardo may have done three self-portraits: Portrait of a Musician, the Vitruvian Man, and the aforementioned Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk. ===Left-handedness=== It has been written that Leonardo \\"may be the most universally recognized left-handed artist of all time\\", a fact documented by numerous Renaissance authors, and manifested conspicuously in his drawing and handwriting. In his notebooks, he wrote in mirror script because of his left handedness (it was easier for him), and he was falsely accused of trying to protect his work.Bambach, Carmen C., Leonardo, Left- Handed Draftsman and Writer, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Leonardo also wrote of using a mirror to judge his compositions more objectively. Early Italian connoisseurs were divided as to whether Leonardo also drew with his right hand. More recently, Anglo-American art historians have for the most part discounted suggestions of ambidexterity.Bambach. ==See also== * The Life of Leonardo da Vinci * Leonardeschi ==ReferencesSources=== * * * ==Further reading== * * Abbott, Elizabeth (2001).

DuMont (A349); and many more. The origin of the nickname \\"The Zoo\\" or just \\"Zoo\\" is rumored to be from the early 1960s when Theta Xi brothers engaged in an altercation with another fraternity during an RPI hockey game. It is believed that RPI's newspaper, The Poly, stated in an article about the altercation that the brothers of Theta Xi acted like \\"a zoo\\". : In December 2013, the chapter house was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House *Zeta Psi (ΖΨ; Zetes), Pi chapter, founded on January 13, 1865 : The Pi chapter went inactive in 1894 and was reactivated in 1951.

The Rensselaer Chapter of the Society was founded in 2015 and runs services out of the \\"Phi Space\\" in the '87 gym. ==Inactive Chapters== RPI has a rich history surrounding Greek Life. As such, a number of fraternities have come and gone either due to low membership or a merger with another entity. . An issue of contention for many RPI students is the recent crackdown of Greek Life activity on campus. With strict adherence to new school policy, a number of fraternities have fallen victim to the tightening regulatory operations, and were subsequently put on suspension. ===Suspended Fraternities=== *Sigma Chi (ΣΧ),http://sigmachi-rpi.org Delta Psi chapter, founded on December 2, 1950 (Suspended October 2019 to December 2021) : The Delta Psi chapter of The Sigma Chi Fraternity was chartered on December 2, 1950.

Their house is one of the largest fraternity houses in the country, and is also the physically largest fraternity house on campus. The house used to be the former iconic St. Francis DeSales Church, which closed on February 1, 2009. The Gamma Tetarton chapter completed the purchase of the St. Francis DeSales Church on February 4, 2011. Shortly after their move-in, Phi Sig began the Mt. Ida Community Microgrant program. As neighbors dedicated to the growth, improvement and future of the Mt. Ida community, Phi Sig sponsors the grant program to improve the “quality of life” in the Mt. Ida neighborhood. Home-owners, landlords, business owners, and non-profits are eligible to apply for a grant up to the amount of $1,000 for the purposes of home improvement, historic restoration, neighborhood beautification projects, and more. *Pi Kappa Phi (ΠΚΦ; Castle), Alpha Tau chapter, founded in 1906.

Not to be confused with Sigma Delta, the local professional sorority. *Theta Delta Chi (ΘΔΧ), 1853-1896 : The Delta Charge of Theta Delta Chi was RPI's first fraternity. Theta Delta Chi served as the sole fraternity on campus until the founding of Sigma Delta in 1859. The Charge had a prominent existence at Rensselaer throughout much of the 19th century until its charter was surrendered in 1896 because of low membership. ===Inactive Sororities=== *Phi Sigma Sigma (ΦΣΣ) founded in 1976 : Phi Sigma Sigma was the first national nonsectarian sorority, founded by 10 women at Hunter College, NY in 1913. Their goal was to have membership open to all women of character regardless of background; a sorority committed to sisterhood, excellence in scholarship, and selfless giving. It is the only sorority that was open to diverse membership from inception and the only one with a ritual that was not based in any one religion. The Gamma Theta chapter was founded at RPI in 1976 as the first national sorority at the mostly male institution. The chapter became inactive in due to low membership. *Sigma Delta (ΣΔ) founded on March 29, 1996 : Sigma Delta is a professional sorority which was incorporated on March 29, 1996 and founded on April 12, 1996.

These complex relationships can be explored through both the liberal and realism lenses and can later explain the debate of power from complex interdependence. ==History of the term== The term \\"complex interdependence\\" was claimed by Raymond Leslie Buell in 1925 to describe the new ordering among economies, cultures, and races. The very concept was popularized through the work of Richard N. Cooper (1968).With the analytical construct of complex interdependence in their critique of political realism, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye explore how international politics forever changed due to the emerging complex interactions and interdependence among states. The theorists recognized that the various and complex transnational connections and interdependencies between states and societies increased, while military force and power balancing are decreasing but remain essential. In coining the interdependence concept, Keohane and Nye also notably differentiated between interdependence and dependence in analyzing the role of power in politics and the relations between international actors. From the analysis, complex interdependence is characterized by three characteristics, involving # The use of multiple channels of action between societies in interstate, transgovernmental, and transnational relations, # The absence of a hierarchy of issues with changing agendas and linkages between issues prioritized, and # The objective of bringing about a decline in military force and coercive power in international relations. Thus, Nye and Keohane argue that the decline of military force as a policy tool and the increase in economic and other forms of interdependence should increase the probability of cooperation among states. The theorists' work surfaced in the 1970s to become a significant challenge to political realist theory in international politics. It became foundational to current theorists that it be categorized as liberalism (international relations), neoliberalism, and liberal institutionalism. Traditional critiques of liberalism often define alongside critiques of political realism. They both ignore the social nature of relations between states and the social fabric of international society. With the rise of neoliberal economics, debates, and the need to clarify international relations theory, Keohane has most recently described himself as merely an institutionalist. This theory's purpose is to develop sociological perspectives in contemporary International relations theory Liberal, neoliberal, and liberal institutional theories continue to influence international politics and have become closely intertwined with political realism. == Multiple channels== Multiple channels that are present in complex interdependence are \\"connect societies, including informal ties between governmental elites as well as formal foreign office arrangements.\\" The second type is \\"informal ties among nongovernmental elites where contact usually happens either face-to-face or through telecommunication. The last type is \\"Transnational organization,\\" including organizations such as multinational banks or corporations. A more straightforward way of thinking of these concepts is by condensing them by calling them interstate, transgovernmental and transnational relations. Therefore, these channels can be a way of communication for states and are a considerable part of complex interdependence. :a. Interstate relations are thought to be \\"normal channels\\" by realists. It is also known as \\"horizontal dimensions of federalism.\\" :b. Transgovernmental relations \\"applies when we relax the realist assumption that states act coherently as units.\\" Crane Liberals believe that states can work together in order to enhance interdependence. :c. Transnational relations \\"applies when we relax the assumption that states are the only units.\\" This take is more of the liberal perspective evident throughout international relations because of institutions' beliefs. === Political Economy of Complex Interdependence === The complex relationships promoted in complex interdependence can be observed in the International Political Economy. As Globalism matures, the political economies of the world grow interdependent. This perspective assumes that the global system is complex, that states' behavior in this system is rational, that global relationships continue to grow in relevance, and that the system of international political economy is not closed. All of this complexity surmises in the uncertain environment of international politics. States that partake in this system hold economic connections with other economies, promoting interdependence between participating states.  Economic Coercion  The emergence of complex interdependence has created dependency among states, as the liberal theorists described. Yet, the realist take on power can be displayed through the economic imbalance experienced among states to inflict their influence through complex interdependence. Such an example would include how China could use loans to fund a new port in Sri Lanka, knowing that Sri Lanka could not pay due to increasing debt. Later, China collected it for themselves. Through the complex relationships and needs of other states, states may use their own systematical advantage over the states that rely on them more. Such complex interdependence can be seen as a negative and a positive among states. Often, states may use such relationships for the greater good of themselves or, at times, the greater good of the other. Economic Coercion through complex interdependence can allow the states to ensure a better world order for all states involved and humanity. Jeff D. Colgan discusses the example of Climate change reform emerging from economic ties. He considers how China's economic dependency on the United States creates fertile ground to instill climate change policies using a \\"climate change club\\" of the United States and the European Union. Any member not in this club would be subject to tariffs from member states, including China, if they don't join. The United States must then decide whether removing economic ties is valuable for them or if maintaining economic relations with China is of more excellent value for all based on the complex interdependence. Such a move displays the ideas of realists in the complex interactions among states. ==References== ==Further reading== *Keohane, R.O., & Nye, J.S. (1987). Power and Interdependence Revisited.

James== Daniel B. James, original owner of the home on Exchange Street, was born in Vermont in 1817. While in Vermont he practiced law. The 1860 U.S. Census says he came to Illinois via California in 1852. James helped found the Republican Party in Sycamore and in 1857 he co-founded the Sycamore True Republican, a newspaper.

Estep suggests that mindspan is superior to lifespan and other measures of health and longevity because a key parameter of mindspan is good mental function throughout life. The Mindspan Diet presents a contrast between the longest lived people with high mental function (\\"the Mindspan Elite\\") and a second group of people from throughout the world who have good healthcare but shorter lives and the highest levels of cognitive decline (\\"the Mindspan Risk\\"). The book suggests that diet is a key difference and contrasts key dietary components and \\"biomarkers\\" (such as body weight and temperature, blood insulin and glucose, cholesterol, etc.) between Mindspan Elite and Mindspan Risk. The book concludes that a key difference between Mindspan Elite and Mindspan Risk is dietary iron, and the amount of iron in the bodies and brains of Mindspan Elite (low iron) and Mindspan Risk (high iron). A key finding of the book that is at odds with current dietary recommendations regards certain refined carbohydrate (carbs) foods. The book presents evidence that the base of the dietary pyramids of the Mindspan Elite is refined carbs in the form of white rice (mindspan leader Japan), and refined wheat pasta and bread (Mediterranean). Estep says that these foods in Mindspan Elite countries and regions are not enriched with iron, while equivalent foods in Mindspan Risk countries and regions are enriched with iron. == Longevity research == Estep is active in longevity and aging research and in criticizing anti-aging claims he suggests are unrealistic or poorly supported. He is the founding CEO and Chief Scientific Officer of TeloMe, Inc, a telomere analysis company and he is the former CEO of the human longevity research biotech company Longenity, Inc., which he founded with Matt Kaeberlein. Longenity has since folded but the company published research showing that a calorie restricted diet feminizes gene expression (in mice) and that it regulates both sirtuin and TOR aging regulatory pathways. He has been highly critical of Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), a plan to reverse and repair the damage of aging. In mid-2006 he was the lead author of a submission by a group of nine scientists to the MIT Technology Review SENS Challenge.Preston W. Estep III, Matt Kaeberlein, Pankaj Kapahi, Brian K.

MIT Technology Review, 2006 July/August;109(3)80-84. http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf The SENS Challenge panel of judges selected this submission as the best but concluded that it failed to meet the burden of proof established by the challenge: to show that \\"SENS is not worthy of learned debate.\\" Some commentators have been critical of this requirement, saying that virtually any idea is worthy of some level of learned debate, though the terms of the prize were known in advance to all participants. Estep and colleagues failed to win the $20,000 prize on offer, but Technology Review's editor, Jason Pontin, nevertheless awarded them $10,000 for their \\"careful scholarship\\". (See the \\"De Grey Technology Review controversy\\" entry for more details.) Their submission criticized the SENS plan as essentially bringing Lysenkoism to modern aging research. Estep and colleagues donated the $10,000 award to the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR). Estep has been openly critical of SENS and of Aubrey de Grey for alleged misrepresentation of scientific evidence, and he suggests that the SENS plan does not address some of the most challenging aspects of aging including unrepaired DNA damage, noncancerous mutation and epimutation of the nuclear genome, and drift of cell and tissue-specific chromatin states. This latter damage type is generally considered a primary cause of cellular dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, which degrade organismal function. While critical of SENS and other anti-aging proposals, Estep is equally critical of the claim made by some in mainstream biogerontology that aging and/or death are incurable. He has challenged claimants to provide evidence for this assertion and points out the absence of evidence or physical law that might stand as a barrier to curing aging.Estep PW.

It was first released in North America, and was later released in Europe. The game is set immediately after the events of the DreamWorks movie Over the Hedge, just like its adaptations on consoles. Gameplay involves guiding three playable woodland creatures through suburban houses to collect items and return them to their forest. House inhabitants and traps must be avoided or neutralized to succeed. The game's plot concerns Gladys Sharp's attempt to turn what is left of the animals' forest into a swimming pool; the animals try to prevent this by luring endangered species to the forest, making the forest a protected habitat. Over the Hedge received positive and average reviews from the gaming press, as well as gaming website IGN's 'Best Game No One Played' award for 2006. The game was praised for the technical achievement of displaying full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, but some reviewers found the gameplay repetitive. ==Gameplay== Verne encounters one of the inhabitants while exploring a house. The red cone on the lower screen shows the man's sight range. In Over the Hedge, the player controls one of three animals, who attempt to steal items and destroy construction materials from suburban homes. The player must explore three- dimensional households in order to complete these objectives, while avoiding the residents and their pets. If the player is spotted, they must escape from the enemy's line of sight, otherwise the player will fail the level. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Each character has their own unique abilities. Verne has the strength to push and carry large items and can retract into his shell in order to avoid detection, but cannot jump as high or run as swift as the other characters. RJ has average strength and agility. He can climb, lift items and also throw Verne. Hammy is the most agile of the three, running swifter and jumping higher. This enables him to circumvent security more easily. Over the Hedge is presented in full 3D on both of the Nintendo DS' screens, which is not often seen in a Nintendo DS game. The upper screen displays the game in an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, whereas the touch screen shows an overhead perspective. The lower screen indicates the sight range of enemies and can be used as a touch screen to target enemies to attack. The console's microphone is used to attract the attention of dogs or to rouse the woodland creatures should they be knocked unconscious. ===Multiplayer=== A multiplayer mini-game is included and allows two players to compete via the DS' wireless connection, only one player needs an Over the Hedge game cartridge for two separate DS consoles to play. Stella the skunk is available in this game mode, alongside the three playable characters from the main game. Players navigate a maze to collect food before the timer runs out. The player with the most food wins the game. A most of five pieces of food can be carried at once, these must be carried to a collection area before more food can be picked up. ==Plot== Over the Hedge is set immediately after the events of the animated film. Gladys Sharp, president of the homeowners' association, plans to bulldoze the forest in order to build a swimming pool. She has been joined by a new character, the taxidermist. The animals decide to lure endangered species to the forest in order to have it declared a protected habitat, preventing its destruction. The householders have been warned about RJ and company's intentions, and have created traps from everyday objects to repel the thieves. ==Development== Unlike the home console versions, the Nintendo DS version of Over the Hedge was created as a separate game by Vicarious Visions. Game writer Evan Skolnick noted the original goal was to make a simple tie-in game with the film, but the development team was soon instructed by Activision to \\"knock this one out of the park\\". As a result, Vicarious Visions decided to write a new story, and create in-game cutscenes using full motion video (FMV). The use of FMV was unusual for the Nintendo DS due to software limitations, such as only having one 3D engine and ROM space restrictions. In a 2007 Game Developers Conference lecture, programmers Chuck Hommick and Gregory Oberg explained how the company avoided many of these obstacles by not including fog or night levels, and by using texture matrices in animated cutscenes. Due to budgetary constraints, only the first two cutscenes were fully animated. The rest were static images with text captions, typically found in Nintendo DS games. Craig Harris of IGN called Over the Hedge \\"one of the most impressive Nintendo DS products this year - at least on a technical level\\". ==Reception== The game received both positive and average reviews from the gaming press, with an average score of 73% from both GameRankings and a 71 from Metacritic. Over the Hedge was awarded IGN's \\"Best Game No One Played\\" award during their 2006 game of the year awards. Several reviewers were impressed by the game's 3D graphics, considering the graphical limitations of the Nintendo DS. GameZone's Louis Bedigian commented \\"Three-dimensional worlds are such a rarity on the DS that you'll definitely take notice\\". In particular, the technical accomplishment of using the DS' two screens to show gameplay in two different angles and in full 3D was praised. Critics are divided over the game's difficulty level and target audience. Some found the game too easy for adult players. Nintendo World Report's Lasse Pallesen stated Over the Hedge is not engaging to adults or children due to \\"the repetitive collect-a-thon nature of the game and the one-dimensional gameplay\\". GameZone's Louis Bedigian had similar reservations, \\"Players young and old will be turned off by the lack of excitement\\". Other reviewers felt the game was suitable for children and adults. Deeko's Pete Sellers found the game \\"a well designed adventure that requires patience and planning\\". Some reviewers found the gameplay, focused mainly on collecting and returning objects, as repetitive. In his GameSpot review, Frank Provo stated \\"Games geared toward younger players are typically repetitive, but Over the Hedge for the Nintendo DS sets a new standard for repetition\\". He lists one of the negative aspects of the game as \\"Whole game feels like housecleaning or a real estate tour\\". GameZone's Louis Bedigian also found the game repetitive, saying \\"..the game stays far away from anything deep, opting for a simplistic series of missions that redefine the meaning of the word rehash\\". ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:2006 video games Category:Activision games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Platform games Category:Stealth video games Category:3D platform games Category:Over the Hedge video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Vicarious Visions games ","title":"Over the Hedge (DS game)"},{"id":"9082676","text":"Porter is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County in southeastern Texas within the metropolitan area.

The Paço Imperial was built in the 18th century to serve as a residence for the governors of colonial Brazil. From 1808, it was used as a royal residence by King John VI of Portugal as King of Portugal and later also as King of Brazil. In 1822 it became the city palace of the monarchs of the Empire of Brazil, Pedro I and Pedro II, who used it not as a residence, but as a workplace. It was one of the main political centers of Brazil for nearly 150 years, from 1743 to 1889. The Paço Imperial is located in the Praça XV de Novembro in central Rio. Due to its architectural and historical significance, it is one of Brazil's most important historic buildings. Today it serves as a cultural center. ==HistoryOrigins=== The current building was constructed by the order of Gomes Freire de Andrade, governor of the Capitania (colonial administrative region) of Rio de Janeiro. The architect was the Portuguese military engineer José Fernandes Pinto Alpoim, a close collaborator of the governor, who greatly enlarged the existing buildings of the Royal mint and the Royal storage house which existed in the same place. This new Governor’s House (Casa dos Governadores) was finished in 1743 in a plain Baroque style and, except for some details, had the same appearance as the building that exists today. The Palace, very similar to contemporary Portuguese manor houses, has a beautiful Baroque portal made of Portuguese marble, several inner courtyards and a stairway to reach the upper storeys. The whole area beside the Governors’s House was also remodelled by Pinto Alpoim and turned into a spacious square (known today as Praça XV) including a marble fountain brought from Lisbon. On the opposite side of the square, a large residential building for the Teles de Menezes family was built (a portion of this building still exists). In 1763, as the seat of the colonial government of Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro, the building was turned into the Viceroy’s Palace (Paço dos Vice-Reis), used by the Viceroy of Brazil as administrative center. Around this period, the square beside the Palace gained a stone harborside quay and a new fountain (Fonte de Mestre Valentim) which still exists today. ===Royal Palace=== King John VI on February 6, 1818 The Palace became a Royal Palace (Paço Real) in 1808, when the court of Prince Regent John of Braganza arrived in Rio, escaping the invasion of Portugal by Napoleon. Here the Prince Regent (later King John VI) ruled the newly named United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Around this time, a third floor was added to the central portion of the façade of the Palace which faced the sea. At the back of the Palace, an elevated passageway was built to link the Palace with the Carmelite Convent, where Queen Mary I of Portugal was housed. A throne room was arranged on the second floor of the Palace, and there the traditional ceremony of beija-mão (hand-kissing) took place. ===Imperial Palace=== Pedro of Braganza greets people on the balcony of the Paço Imperial In 1822, Brazil became an independent nation as the Empire of Brazil. The Palace continued as an administrative center under Emperor Pedro I and his successor Pedro II. At this time it was renamed the Imperial Palace (Paço Imperial). The Emperors resided at the São Cristóvão Palace (Palace of St. Christopher), but the Imperial Palace remained the formal seat of the Court and the monarch's workplace. Several important events in the History of Brazil are associated with the Paço Imperial. On 9 January 1822, Pedro I announced from one of the balconies of the Palace facing the square that he would refuse Portuguese orders and remain on in an independent Brazil (the so-called Dia do Fico). During 1888 in one of the Palace chambers, Pedro II's daughter Princess Isabel, acting as regent, signed the famous Lei Áurea, which definitively banned slavery from Brazil. In addition, the Palace and its adjacent square and chapel were the scene for the coronations of John VI, Pedro I and Pedro II and other public celebrations. ===Decay and restoration=== With the establishment of the Republic of Brazil in 1889, the Paço Imperial lost its former importance and was converted into the central Mail Office for Rio de Janeiro. The interior decorations of the rooms were dispersed, and the façades were modified. In 1980 a major restoration returned the building to the appearance it had around 1818. This task was made easier as an enormous number of images from the 18th and 19th centuries depict the Palace in detail. Since 1984 the Paço Imperial has been an important cultural center, hosting temporary art exhibitions of painting, sculpture, cinema, music, etc. It also houses the Paulo Santos Library, specializing in art, architecture and engineering, and also containing several rare books from the 16th to the 18th centuries. ==Gallery== File:Paço da cidade 1818.jpgThe Paço Imperial in 1818 File:Aclamação de D Pedro II em 1831 by Debret.jpgAcclamation of Pedro II, 1831 File:Casamento princesa isabel.jpgThe palace being prepared for the wedding ceremony of Princess Isabel and Prince Gaston of Orléans, 1864 File:Povo paço 1888.jpgPrincess Isabel is cheered from the central balcony by a crowd in the streets, moments after having signed the Golden Law, 1888.

The character first appears in the second-season episode \\"Four Months Later...\\", although the legend of Kensei is referenced several times during the first season. His regenerative ability has halted his aging, making him centuries old in the present of the series. He is the primary antagonist during the second season. == Character overview  Genesis ===  Takezo Kensei  The name \\"Kensei\\" means \\"master swordsman\\" and \\"Takezo\\" is the birthname of the historical swordmaster Miyamoto Musashi – Kensei is based upon various legends of Japanese swordsmen, including Musashi. According to the legend, Kensei was a Japanese hero, well known for saving Japan from in the 17th century. However, he proves to be a Briton who came to Japan seeking his fortune. Hiro mentions the legend of Takezo Kensei many times in season one, though little is actually related until he trains in kendo with his father in the episode \\"Landslide\\". Previously, in \\"Godsend\\" and \\"The Fix\\", Hiro mentioned that the sword – which he was working to steal from Mr. Linderman – helped Kensei focus his power. He also said that his father used to tell him stories of Kensei, presumably including the many that Hiro tells Kensei in season two. When training with his father for his part in \\"saving the world\\" before the showdown with Sylar in New York, Hiro relates the story of \\"Kensei and the Dragon\\" and realizes that, if he wants to win, he must be strong enough to sacrifice himself. In the 17th century, civil war threatened Japan; behind it was the warlord \\"White Beard.\\" Kensei found a sword frozen in the snow. He was not, however, a good enough fighter to wield it, so he went to see the dragon of Kiso Mountain, who could teach him the sword's secrets. The dragon agreed to do this in exchange for Kensei's love. Knowing that Japan would fall under the rule of \\"White Beard\\" unless he took action, he had to agree to the dragon's demands even though he loved a princess. After saving Japan in a great battle, the dragon came to Kensei to claim his end of the bargain. The dragon demanded the life of the swordsmith's daughter, the princess Kensei loved. Instead, Kensei cut out his own heart and handed it to the dragon, saying, \\"My love is in here. Take it,\\" and he died. According to the mockumentary \\"Sword Saint\\", presented on the official Heroes 360 website, the dragon was touched by how much the warrior was willing to offer for his people and love, and restored Kensei's heart to him. Kensei then ran away with the princess. In \\"Out of Time\\", it is revealed that Hiro Nakamura is the Takezo Kensei portrayed in legends, or rather the source behind the tales, having used his own knowledge of the stories to inspire the real Kensei to create the legends. The real Kensei becomes a villain after Yaeko (the Swordsmith's daughter) falls for Hiro, and after Kensei's defeat she spreads Hiro's tale under Kensei's name. === Generations ===  Takezo Kensei  After Hiro time travels to 1671 in Ōtsu, Japan, a swordsman rides alone against a larger unit of Japanese warriors before a solar eclipse occurs. Hiro stops time, and, believing the man to be Kensei, teleports the lone warrior and himself away. The man is startled, reveals that he's not really Kensei, and runs away. The real Kensei then emerges and confronts Hiro, explaining that he is actually from England. It appears that the real Kensei is far more interested in making money than being a hero to the people. Hiro tells Kensei that he is supposed to save the village of Ōtsu, just as it is made known that Ōtsu is on fire. At this point, a legendary sword smith's daughter from Ōtsu, Yaeko, takes Kensei's sword, which her father had made for him in return for the latter's promise to protect the village. She blames Kensei for betraying her father's trust and allowing the village to be robbed and burnt. In the episode \\"Lizards\\", Hiro, unable to convince Kensei to become a hero on his own, disguises himself as Kensei and creates one of the first stories himself by disarming twelve bandits. In doing so, he enamors Yaeko to Kensei, which in turn convinces Kensei that becoming the legend might be beneficial. When the bandits return for a sneak attack on Kensei, firing several arrows into his chest, it is revealed that Kensei possesses the power of cellular regeneration. Though he seems to die at first, his wounds heal and he revives as Hiro removes the arrows. Kensei is visibly surprised by the turn of events, suggesting that he had been unaware of it prior to his encounter with Hiro. Initially, Kensei is horrified by the discovery of his ability, believing Hiro to have cursed him. Once Hiro convinces him that it is a natural gift, he is delighted. Since he is functionally immortal, he can take on any challenge without having to worry about dying; in particular, the prospect of wagered duels seems profitable. Still dismayed that Kensei is unwilling to accept his destiny, Hiro forces Kensei to live out another story: retrieving the fire scroll from the 90 angry ronin (also called the 90 Hungry Ronin in Japanese folklore). All the while, Hiro reassures Yaeko that Kensei will return, which he does, now willing to fulfill his destiny. The three then set to work on freeing Ōtsu from White Beard, only to find that the conqueror's entire army has settled there. Having gathered a map of the camp, they are able to sneak in and rescue Yaeko's father, only to discover that, during his captivity, he taught them how to forge guns (illegal during this portion of Japan's history, and thus a significant advantage for White Beard) in order to overthrow the Emperor (then Emperor Go-Sai) and seize power. Hiro realizes that this is the thing he is here to fix, and convinces Kensei to destroy the cache of weapons. As the three evacuate Yaeko's father, Hiro is forced to teleport himself and Yaeko out of the path of a bullet. This reveals to her that it was Hiro, not Kensei, that saved her life earlier and she kisses him. Kensei finds them kissing and feels betrayed. Despite Hiro's insistence that it's a one-time occurrence, Kensei apparently returns to his previous ways and allies himself with White Beard, knocking Hiro out and delivering him to the conqueror in exchange for whatever he wants — he demands half the country and Yaeko as his princess. When Hiro claims that Kensei was supposed to be a hero, Kensei counters by saying that he will be once he conquers Japan, confidently stating that he will \\"change history.\\" After Yaeko helps to free Hiro, Kensei anticipates Hiro's first move to destroy White Beard's guns. Takezo confronts Hiro as he is spreading gunpowder over the area and attacks him, despite Hiro's pleas that they should work together. Hiro refuses to use his powers to win the duel, and they have a brief battle, during which Kensei knocks over a lamp and starts a fire. As the fire spreads, Hiro knocks Kensei's sword out of his hands, and offers the defeated Kensei a chance to escape. Kensei, driven mad by Yaeko's love for Hiro, claims that he will destroy everything Hiro holds dear (starting with Yaeko) and so Hiro leaves him to die. He finds Kensei's helmet and mask amidst the debris, and returns to Yaeko. She says that it is really he who is the legendary Takezo Kensei. However, Hiro knows that the legend isn't over yet: he must cut out his heart by leaving Yaeko behind. A tearful Yaeko promises to spread his tale. Hiro then leaves, thinking Kensei is dead and history restored.  Adam Monroe  Due to his regenerative ability, Kensei not only survives the explosion, but is made immortal by the constant regeneration of his cells. At some point between 1671 and the founding of the Company, Takezo Kensei renames himself Adam Monroe, and becomes a British mercenary during the American Revolutionary War. It was not out of loyalty to the British, but simply to \\"escape boredom.\\" He appears to think of himself as a god. At one point, Adam comes across a town in which the British regiment had been single-handedly slaughtered by a man named Evan, according to a survivor. Intrigued, Adam arrived at the scene to confront the man, and killed him. However, after killing him, an entire army of clones rushes at the regiment and caused them to retreat, leaving Adam behind. He realizes that Evan is a human replicator and pursues him across a number of years, trying to kill the original Evan. Eventually, a number of Evan clones confront and taunt Adam, saying that in numbers there is strength and he is alone and cannot possibly defeat them, and pushes Adam over a cliff into a river. It is at this point, defeated, Adam realized the need for followers. Monroe creates the Company about three hundred years after his first encounter with Hiro Nakamura. As shown in \\"Truth & Consequences\\", when the Company began research into the Shanti virus, he attempted to release a highly virulent strain, claiming that something needs to be done about the endless cycle of destruction humanity seems to go through. Adam is locked away by Kaito Nakamura, never to be released again. Victoria Pratt mentions that in order to know as much as he did, he would have needed the help of some of the other founders; Robert Bishop, another founder, mentions that Maury Parkman and Daniel Linderman were among those who believed in his theories of their superiority over humanity. As revealed in \\"Four Months Ago...\\", Adam escapes Company custody with the help of Peter Petrelli, a willing prisoner, by convincing him that the Company has no intention of helping him. Once free, Adam begins assassinating the Company's other founding members, using Maury Parkman as his agent. In \\"Four Months Later...\\", Kaito Nakamura stays on the rooftop of the Deveaux Building expecting that one of the remaining members of the group of twelve, of which he was a part, will try to kill him. A mysterious hooded figure appears. Kaito appears to recognize the individual as a member of that team, saying \\"Of all of them, I never expected that it would be you\\". Just as Ando, whom Kaito had sent to get him a sword, returns, the figure tackles Kaito and pushes him off the building. When Ando looks down, the figure has disappeared. In \\"The Line\\", Mohinder observes Adam's name written on a folder Bob was carrying. Later, when Bob says that he has big problems and an individual to worry about who could be a real danger, Mohinder brings up Adam's name. Later, Peter and Caitlin find a note (signed \\"Adam\\") in Montreal addressed to Peter, warning him about the Company. In \\"Out of Time\\", Bob tells Nathan that Adam was the one who suggested the group of twelve come together, and suggested holocausts and plagues to help save the world, claiming that Adam felt he was a god. Nathan notes that Adam's plans sound like Linderman, and Bob tells Nathan that Linderman was his disciple. Later, Peter returns to Montreal and hears a noise. He sends a bolt towards the intruder, but the bolt is blocked by a hand, and it regenerates. Adam walks towards Peter and asks why he fired at him, but Peter tells him he doesn't know who he is. At this, Adam reintroduces himself to Peter. In \\"Four Months Ago...\\", Adam once again befriends a now amnesic Peter Petrelli, helping him to restore his memory through his absorbed regenerative abilities. After gaining back his memory, Peter tells Adam about the effects of the virus in the future and the two set out to destroy it, though Adam's true intentions remain to be seen. In \\"Truth & Consequences\\", Adam leads Peter to Victoria Pratt, the creator of the immensely dangerous \\"Strain 138\\" that he attempted to release in 1977. Despite her lack of cooperation, Peter's telepathy allows him to retrieve the location of the virus. Adam unties Victoria, but kills her when she aims a shotgun at Peter's head, claiming to have been protecting Peter's life. As Peter walks out of the house, Adam looks at Victoria's lifeless body and says, \\"If anyone survives... I'll tell them I couldn't have done it without you\\". He dabs some of the blood from his healed chest wound, puts the Helix symbol on a picture of Victoria's face, and drops it on her corpse. The two then travel to Primatech Paper in Texas, where the virus is kept. Hiro intercepts them, freezing time and intending to kill Adam, but Peter remains unfrozen and refuses to let Hiro harm Adam. In the final episode of Volume 2, \\"Powerless\\", Adam and Peter make it to the vault where the virus is kept. While Adam goes to retrieve the virus, Peter is confronted by Nathan and Matt Parkman, who tell him that Adam is using him. Hiro teleports to the vault and confronts Adam. He claims that he \\"should have killed him long ago\\" before teleporting both of them away. When Ando asks Hiro if he killed Adam, Hiro responds that Adam can never harm anyone again. It is then shown that Adam has been buried alive in a Japanese cemetery near Kaito Nakamura screaming for \\"Carp\\" to let him out. Series creator Tim Kring gave no indication that Adam could escape from his makeshift prison, saying \\"the fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments.\\" However, David Anders suggested that his character would be returning in future episodes. In the graphic novel The Ten Brides of Takezo Kensei, Monroe thinks that his new wife will find and rescue him from being buried alive. === Villains ===  Adam Monroe  In the third volume, Angela Petrelli has a precognitive dream in which Adam Monroe is seen alongside Maury Parkman, Tracy Strauss, Knox, and Sylar killing the Heroes. In the final moments of \\"I Am Become Death\\", Hiro and Ando dig Adam up in hopes of gaining information on the formula. In the following episode, he is released from his casket prison under the pretense that he will assist Hiro and Ando in retrieving the formula. After arriving at a bar that he claims specializes in hiring superpowered individuals to commit crimes, he goads the bartender into attacking him, and lets Hiro take the blow instead. While Hiro lies unconscious and Ando goes to his aid, he escapes, only to be knocked unconscious himself by Knox in a back alley and taken away in a van on the orders of Arthur Petrelli. Upon arriving with Knox, Adam discovers that Arthur is still alive, yet paralyzed. Realizing what Arthur wants, a panicked Adam tries to escape but is forced to touch Arthur's hand. Arthur then steals Adam's power of regeneration and heals himself. After having his power drained by Arthur, Adam seems to rapidly age, then crumbles to dust. ===Redemption===  Adam Monroe  When Arnold, the time traveller seen at the \\"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\\" travels back in time on Joseph's command in the graphic novel \\"Bloodlines, Part 1\\", he comes to Coyote Sands. Seeing it is under construction he realizes he is too early, at which point Adam Monroe, in military attire, knocks him out with shovel. He notes he hasn't seen a time traveler in a long while. In \\"Bloodlines, Part 2\\", he seems to have befriended an amnesic Arnold, who goes by the name Ernie Crum. Adam says goodbye to him before going; it's hinted that Adam was present during the murder of Coyote Sands' posthumans, as Adam shows up to Arnold with a ruined uniform just after the heavy storm (caused by Alice Shaw) in May, 1961 (1961). In the episode \\"Pass/Fail\\", as Hiro falls into a coma, he experiences a mental trial in which Adam acts as the prosecutor, accusing him of selfishly altering time. Finally, Hiro battles Adam in a sword-fight for his honor, kills Adam and ends up receiving the healing kiss of his mother. == Wives == *Helene - 1672 (Germany) *Maria - 1747 (Italy) *Frederica - 1782 (France) *Yumi (Yaeko's great- granddaughter) - 1784 (Japan) *Angelica - 1787 (Northwest) *Maria - 1864 (Atlanta) *Diane - 1901 (Canada) *Louisa - 1926 (Chicago) *Theresa - 1958 (Los Angeles) *Trina - 1977 *Unknown Eleventh Wife - ????-Present Some of Adam's wives leave him fearful of his power, some he abandons, and two, Angelica and Diane, are the loves of his life and he stays with them for 62 and 20 years, respectively.Heroes Revealed page 39 == Powers and abilities == Adam Monroe has the power of rapid cellular regeneration, allowing him to heal almost instantly from most injuries. He first displays it in \\"Lizards\\", where he is shot by three arrows. After the arrows are removed, his wounds heal and he revives. In \\"Kindred\\", he proceeds to repeatedly injure himself just to make sure it wasn't a trick played on him by Hiro. In the episode \\"Out of Time\\", he survives a massive gunpowder explosion. When his blood is injected into others, they are also healed. In addition to allowing him to heal from any injury, Adam's power has effectively made him immortal. This is explained in the Season 2 episode \\"Cautionary Tales\\" by Angela Petrelli; his cells have regenerated so many times that they are now dying and regenerating in equilibrium, therefore halting his aging. However, it is also revealed that his power was the only thing keeping him alive; when Arthur Petrelli steals his ability, he crumbles to dust.

The station also presented a mix of new music, with club classics - and gained its popularity primarily based on the music mix, however, the radio station offered a number of personalities and a format that was a viable listening alternative to the mainstream commercial broadcasters. City FM was one of many temporary broadcasters at the time vying for a full-time radio license, that was to be issued to not-for-profit organizations by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The first of the temporary radio stations were suburban community radio broadcasting groups, which under the broadcasting legislation in place in the 1980s the then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal permitted up to two weeks of temporary broadcasts per broadcast group with a maximum allocation of 4 weeks per annum. These broadcasts were referred to at that time as \\"Test Broadcasts\\", designed to test either facility of readiness to broadcast and audience response to the proposed service being trialed at the time of the test broadcast. The incoming Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) was established under the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992, and its role was to provide for additional radio services. Part of this role was the extension of the \\"Test Broadcast\\" system to allow for more flexibility and therefore providing more options for new community-based groups and narrowcasters to enter broadcasting - something which was not able to occur previously. One of the effects of this was the establishment of long- period \\"temporary licenses\\" for periods of up to 90 days. The first group in Australia to participate in the long term temporary license permitted by the new ABA was HitzFM in Melbourne, Australia (Founded by Anton Vanderlely) in late 1993. By 2001, there were many temporary community radio stations in Melbourne (and similarly in Sydney) vying for a limited number of full-time licenses, these included: Joy FM, Kiss 90FM, KIX 91.5, Hitz FM, Laugh Radio, Pulse Fm, StreetFM/Street Nation, Employment Access Radio (EAR FM), HotFM Chart Radio, Golden Days Radio - Caulfield, SRA (RIMT University, Melb), 3MU (Monash University, Caulfield), SubFM (La Trobe University, Bundoora), and Kool'N'Deadly (3KND - Preston). The first of the CityFM temporary broadcasts was established in what was known as the \\"Tandy Building\\" in Moorabbin Victoria. The transmitter site was at Casseldon Place on the Melbourne CBD, which provided around 25 km coverage from a 250 Watt FM transmitter through a single folded dipole antenna. The personalities and announcers on the initial CityFM broadcasts included: *Anton Vanderlely (founder, manager until end of 4th temp broadcast) *Gerry Nyein (Breakfast) *Adam Vaughan *Glenn Hampson (Nights) *Paul Thompson *Joel David Fleming *Arthur Koustas (Midday - 4pm) *Chris 'The Ferret' Feretopoulos (Late Night) *Kat & Jorgia Georgakopoulos aka \\"The City Sisters\\" *Shane Ryan (Mornings) *Jason Shaw *John Fucci *Vlad *Funky Phil Vasallo (weekends) *Michael Grossbard *Gerry Burke *James East *Gary Maddick *Steve Perry *Michael Grech *Kevin Donegan Some of the names were participants of later temporary broadcasts. Not all were involved in the first breakthrough broadcast. The first broadcast was technically able within 48 hours from gaining tenancy access at the Moorabbin location. This required all preparatory work to be completed ahead of time, which was the case, and the studios just needed to function – thus were built using old desks, old wall dividers and office panels, milk crates, and borrowed equipment. The first temporary broadcast was presented over a period of 8 weeks on the frequency 91.5 MHz FM, the station was a great success with rapid audience take-up from the very first day of test broadcasting, till CITY FM ceased test broadcasting operations in 2001. CityFM operated 3 more temporary broadcasts from its Moorabbin offices before moving to Level 2 - 227 Commercial Road South Yarra/Prahran, where it presented its final four temporary broadcasts. The broadcast periods were: *Broadcast 1: 8 weeks (Moorabbin) - (May 1, 1998, to June 30, 1998) *Broadcast 2: 11 weeks (Moorabbin) *Broadcast 3: 11 weeks (Moorabbin) *Broadcast 4: 8 weeks (Moorabbin) *Broadcast 5: 6 weeks (South Yarra) *Broadcast 6: 6 weeks (South Yarra) *Broadcast 7: 2 weeks (South Yarra) - Originally licensed for 4 weeks *Broadcast 8: 4 weeks (South Yarra) • Broadcast 7 was cut short following a result of a mid-broadcast AGM election being adverse to the then Committee of Management. The office holders of the outgoing Committee closed down the broadcast and restricted access to the studio facilities. It was this action that was key to the organisation being refused a permanent (long term) broadcasting licence. CityFM was operated by Central Melbourne FM Incorporated, incorporated under the Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Victoria), and although it submitted a comprehensive application for a full-time licence - internal divisions and related disruptions to administration (from broadcast 7 onwards), management and licensed temporary broadcast time (Broadcast 7) led to the Australian Broadcasting Authority's (ABA) decision not to issue a licence to City FM on the basis that it did not have the management capacity to operate either a temporary or ongoing broadcasting service. CityFM was in competition for the inner city licence with Joy Melbourne. Joy Melbourne was the successful applicant for the 94.9 FM Inner City licence, which was allocated on 21 December 2001. In recent times, since the issue of full-time licences in 2001, the organisation (Central Melbourne FM Incorporated) itself has lapsed through nil activity. ==References== ==External links== * https://www.city1051fm.com/ * Archived Site * Australian Broadcasting Authority Licence Allocation Report December, 2001 * City Facebook page * https://www.city1051fm.com/ Category:Defunct radio stations in Australia Category:Radio stations in Melbourne Category:Radio stations established in 1998 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2001 Category:Community radio stations in Australia ","title":"CityFM"},{"id":"9082799","text":"1939 Kasota building in 1927 Gateway District 1939 Hennepin Avenue 2007 The Gateway District of Minneapolis is centered at the convergence of Hennepin Avenue, Nicollet Avenue, and Washington Avenue. Its borders are not officially designated or recognized, but are visible as the Mississippi River to the northeast, Cedar Lake Trail and the railroad tracks to the northwest, Fifth Avenue South to the southeast. and Fourth Street South to the southwest. The district includes a significant part of the Downtown West neighborhood and abuts the North Loop. In the early years of Minneapolis, the neighborhood was called \\"Bridge Square\\", because it lay at the southern foot of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge and it was the commercial hub and government seat of the growing city. An early courthouse and city hall were located in a triangle-shaped building in between Washington, Hennepin and, Nicollet from 1873 to 1912. Some of the early permanent structures on the West side of Minneapolis were built directly across from that building. The \\"Gateway District\\" was given such a name in hopes of revitalizing it at the turn of the 20th century, hoping to restore its status as the gateway into Minneapolis. Both the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot and the Milwaukee Road Depot were situated in the area, and numerous hotels and office buildings were constructed, including the Nicollet Hotel, the Hotel Vendome, the St. James Hotel, the Boston Block, and the Metropolitan building. A Depression-era renewal attempt brought the Minneapolis Main Post Office (1935) and Pioneer Square, the former of which survives. The area remains as the historic core of the city, although much of that history was demolished in an Urban Renewal act during the late 1950s. The Metropolitan Building, demolished in 1961, is the most lamented loss of the area. The area now boasts some of the city's finest examples of modern architecture. Voya Financial currently occupies the former Northwestern National Life Insurance Building (1965), which occupies four blocks of the Gateway. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis was located in a suspension building (1973) at the terminus of the Nicollet Mall. It is now located on the Mississippi riverbank across Hennepin Avenue from the central Minneapolis post office. With the construction of the new Central Library for the Minneapolis Public Library system, the old gateway has become a target for developers and planners. Former Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak had proposed a park, trees and a 10-year action plan for Washington Avenue. On Feb. 4, 2015, city planners recommended that the City Council approve selling the former Nicollet Hotel block to United Properties, a main holding of the Pohlads, who also own the Minnesota Twins. The proposed development, 36-story tower and hotel complex dubbed \\"The Gateway,\\" still requires a City Council vote and approval.Minneapolis Star Tribune digital edition – Friday, Feb. 6, 2015 http://www.startribune.com/business/291045411.html ==See also== *History of Minneapolis, Minnesota *Skid row ==References== ==External links== *Mpls: Long Gone: The Gateway, hundreds of photos of old buildings in the area since demolished Category:Geography of Minneapolis Category:Former populated places in Minnesota Category:Former populated places in Hennepin County, Minnesota Category:Skid Rows ","title":"Gateway District (Minneapolis)"},{"id":"9082805","text":"The YWCA is an association supporting women and girls.

(Guaruba guarouba), is a medium-sized golden-yellow Neotropical parrot native to the Amazon Basin of interior northern Brazil. Its plumage is mostly bright yellow, hence its common name, but it also possesses green remiges.Golden Palms - Golden Conure URL accessed January 26, 2007. It lives in the drier, upland rainforests in Amazonian Brazil, and is threatened by deforestation and flooding, and also by the now-illegal trapping of wild individuals for the pet trade.Honolulu Zoo URL accessed January 24, 2007. It is listed on CITES appendix I. German naturalist Georg Marcgraf first described the bird, called guaruba in his expedition to Dutch Brazil in 1638. Its Portuguese and indigenous name, ararajuba, means small yellow macaw. In aviculture, it is sometimes known as the Queen of Bavaria conure.Aratinga guarouba URL accessed January 26, 2007. ==Taxonomy== Formerly classified as Aratinga guarouba , it is now a species in the monotypic genus Guaruba, one of numerous genera of New World long-tailed parrots in tribe Arini, which also includes the Central and South American macaws. Tribe Arini together with the Amazonian parrots and a few miscellaneous genera make up subfamily Arinae of Neotropical parrots in family Psittacidae of true parrots. The specific name guarouba (alternately guaruba) is derived from Old Tupi: guará, \\"small bird\\"; and Old Tupi: yuba, \\"yellow\\"; hence \\"small yellow bird\\". The different spellings of the genus and species names result from the different spellings used by Lesson and Gmelin when they postulated the taxa. The taxonomic convention is to retain the names as spelled by the original authorities. Molecular studies show that Guaruba and Diopsittaca (red-shouldered macaw) are sister genera. It is also closely related to Leptosittaca branicki, (golden- plumed parakeet). ==Description== The golden parakeet is long and mainly yellow with green in the outer wings and with an all-yellow tail. It has a large horn-colored (gray) beak, pale-pink bare eye rings, brown irises, and pink legs. Males and females have identical external appearance. Juveniles are duller and have less yellow and more green plumage than the adults. The juvenile's head and neck are mostly green, the back is green and yellow, the upper side of tail is mostly green, the breast is greenish, the eye rings are pale-gray, and the legs are brown. ==Distribution and habitat== Its range is estimated to be limited to about 174,000 km2. between the Tocantins, lower Xingu, and Tapajós Rivers in the Amazon Basin south of the Amazon River in the state of Pará, northern Brazil. Additional records occur from adjacent northern Maranhão. The birds in a 1986 study used two different habitats during the year; during the nonbreeding season, which coincided with the dry season, they occupied the tall forest. During the breeding season, they left the tall forest and entered open areas on the edge of the forest such as fields used in agriculture. == Behavior == Golden parakeets are a social species, living, feeding, sleeping, and even breeding together. In the wild, they have a varied diet, feeding on fruits such as mango, muruci and açai, flowers, buds, seeds (including Croton matouensis, and crop plants, particularly maize. == Reproduction == The golden parakeet's breeding system is almost unique amongst parrots, as pairs are aided by a number of helpers which aid in the raising of the young. This behavior is less common with parakeets in captivity, which often abandon their young after three weeks. After the golden parakeet reaches sexual maturity at the age of three years, the breeding season starts in November and runs through February. They nest in a high tree, in deeper than average nesting cavities, and lay an average of four white eggs, which they aggressively guard. The incubation period is about 30 days, in which the male and female take turns incubating. In the first few years of sexual maturity, golden parakeets tend to lay infertile clutches until the age of six to eight. In captivity, golden parakeets resume breeding when their chicks are taken from them.Golden Conure - Breeding URL accessed January 26, 2007. At birth, golden parakeets are covered in white down that eventually turns darker within a week. By the end of the third week, wing feathers start to develop. Juveniles are playful, but may turn abusive against their peers. Nestlings are preyed upon by toucans, which may explain their social behavior. Nests are vigorously defended from toucans by several members of the group. ==Conservation and threats== The golden parakeet is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. This is largely due to deforestation and the capture of wild birds for aviculture, where it is in high demand due to the attractiveness of its plumage. Locally, they are considered as pests for feeding on crops, and are hunted for food or sport. The current population is estimated to be in the range of 10,000 to 20,000. An example of the displacement of golden parakeets by habitat loss comes from the building of the Tucuruí Dam, Pará, from 1975–1984. More than 35,000 forest dwellers were forced from what had been a habitat that was considered to be \\"among the richest and most diversified in the world.\\" In addition, of rainforest were flooded, and 1,600 islands were produced by the flooding, all of which were heavily deforested.Deforestation URL accessed January 26, 2007.

An elastomeric film is coated on both sides with electrodes. The electrodes are connected to a circuit. By applying a voltage U the electrostatic pressure p_{el} acts. Due to the mechanical compression the elastomer film contracts in the thickness direction and expands in the film plane directions. The elastomer film moves back to its original position when it is short-circuited. Dielectric elastomers (DEs) are smart material systems that produce large strains. They belong to the group of electroactive polymers (EAP). DE actuators (DEA) transform electric energy into mechanical work. They are lightweight and have a high elastic energy density. They have been investigated since the late 1990s. Many prototype applications exist. Every year, conferences are held in the US and Europe.European conference == Working principles == A DEA is a compliant capacitor (see image), where a passive elastomer film is sandwiched between two compliant electrodes. When a voltage U is applied, the electrostatic pressure p_{el} arising from the Coulomb forces acts between the electrodes. The electrodes squeeze the elastomer film. The equivalent electromechanical pressure p_{eq} is twice the electrostatic pressure p_{el} and is given by: p_{eq}=\\\\varepsilon_0\\\\varepsilon_r\\\\frac{U^2}{z^2} where \\\\varepsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity, \\\\varepsilon_r is the dielectric constant of the polymer and z is the thickness of the elastomer film. Usually, strains of DEA are in the order of 10–35%, maximum values reach 300% (the acrylic elastomer VHB 4910, commercially available from 3M, which also supports a high elastic energy density and a high electrical breakdown strength.) === Ionic === Replacing the electrodes with soft hydrogels allows ionic transport to replace electron transport. Aqueous ionic hydrogels can deliver potentials of multiple kilovolts, despite the onset of electrolysis at below 1.5 V. The difference between the capacitance of the double layer and the dielectric leads to a potential across the dielectric that can be millions of times greater than that across the double layer. Potentials in the kilovolt range can be realized without electrochemically degrading the hydrogel. Deformations are well controlled, reversible, and capable of high-frequency operation. The resulting devices can be perfectly transparent. High-frequency actuation is possible. Switching speeds are limited only by mechanical inertia. The hydrogel's stiffness can be thousands of times smaller than the dielectric's, allowing actuation without mechanical constraint across a range of nearly 100% at millisecond speeds. They can be biocompatible. Remaining issues include drying of the hydrogels, ionic build-up, hysteresis, and electrical shorting. Early experiments in semiconductor device research relied on ionic conductors to investigate field modulation of contact potentials in silicon and to enable the first solid-state amplifiers. Work since 2000 has established the utility of electrolyte gate electrodes. Ionic gels can also serve as elements of high-performance, stretchable graphene transistors. == Materials == Films of carbon powder or grease loaded with carbon black were early choices as electrodes for the DEAs. Such materials have poor reliability and are not available with established manufacturing techniques. Improved characteristics can be achieved with liquid metal, sheets of graphene, coatings of carbon nanotubes, surface-implanted layers of metallic nanoclusters and corrugated or patterned metal films. These options offer limited mechanical properties, sheet resistances, switching times and easy integration. Silicones and acrylic elastomers are other alternatives. The requirements for an elastomer material are: * The material should have low stiffness (especially when large strains are required); * The dielectric constant should be high; * The electrical breakdown strength should be high. Mechanically prestretching the elastomer film offers the possibility of enhancing the electrical breakdown strength. Further reasons for prestretching include: * Film thickness decreases, requiring a lower voltage to obtain the same electrostatic pressure; * Avoiding compressive stresses in the film plane directions. The elastomers show a visco-hyperelastic behavior. Models that describe large strains and viscoelasticity are required for the calculation of such actuators. Materials used in research include graphite powder, silicone oil / graphite mixtures, gold electrodes. The electrode should be conductive and compliant. Compliance is important so that the elastomer is not constrained mechanically when elongated. Films of polyacrylamide hydrogels formed with salt water can be laminated onto the dielectric surfaces, replacing electrodes. DEs based on silicone (PDMS) and natural rubber are promising research fields. Properties such as fast response times and efficiency are superior using natural rubber based DEs compared to VHB (acrylic elastomer) based DEs for strains under 15%. == Instabilites in Dielectric elastomers == Dielectric elastomer actuators are to be designed so as to avoid the phenomenon of dielectric breakdown in their whole course of motion. In addition to the dielectric breakdown, DEAs are susceptible to another failure mode, referred to as the electromechanical instability, which arises due to nonlinear interaction between the electrostatic and the mechanical restoring forces. In several cases, the electromechanical instability precedes the dielectric breakdown. The instability parameters (critical voltage and the corresponding maximum stretch) are dependent on several factors, such as the level of prestretch, temperature, and the deformation dependent permittivity. Additionally, they also depend on the voltage waveform used to drive the actuator. https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/appliedmechanics/article/85/11/111009/444956/A-Modulated- Voltage-Waveform-for-Enhancing-the == Configurations == Configurations include: * Framed/In-Plane actuators: A framed or in-plane actuator is an elastomeric film coated/printed with two electrodes. Typically a frame or support structure is mounted around the film. Examples are expanding circles and planars (single and multiple phase.) * Cylindrical/Roll actuators: Coated elastomer films are rolled around an axis. By activation, a force and an elongation appear in the axial direction. The actuators can be rolled around a compression spring or without a core. Applications include artificial muscles (prosthetics), mini- and microrobots, and valves. * Diaphragm actuators: A diaphragm actuator is made as a planar construction which is then biased in the z-axis to produce out of plane motion. * Shell-like actuators: Planar elastomer films are coated at specific locations in the form of electrode segments. With a well-directed activation, the foils assume complex three- dimensional shapes. Examples may be utilized for propelling vehicles through air or water, e.g. for blimps. * Stack actuators: Stacking planar actuators can increase deformation. Actuators that shorten under activation are good candidates. * Thickness Mode Actuators: The force and stroke moves in the z-direction (out of plane). Thickness mode actuators are a typically a flat film that may stack layers to increase displacement. *Bending actuators:The in-plane actuation of dielectric elastomer (DE) based actuator is converted into out-of-plane actuation such as bending or folding using unimorph configuration where one or multiple layers of DE sheets are stacked on top of one layer of inactive substrate. *Balloon actuators: Plane elastomer is attached to an air chamber and inflated with a constant volume of air, then the stiffness of the elastomer can be varied by applying electrical load; hence resulting in voltage-controlled bulging of the elastomeric balloon. == Applications == Dielectric elastomers offer multiple potential applications with the potential to replace many electromagnetic actuators, pneumatics and piezo actuators.

These are in Swedish with Danish and English sub-titles. Irene Huss movies are a collection of films about a fictional Swedish police officer played by Angela Kovács. A total of twelve 90-minute films produced between the years 2007 to 2011. All but three movies based on the books of the same name titles, written by author Helene Tursten. The last three films have been produced based instead on the books' characters and are thus independent stories. Films set in the Gothenburg area, where viewers get to follow both Irene Huss in the work as a police officer but also in her family, which are often strongly influenced by her work. The twelve films were made in two installments; a first round in which the films were released in 2007-2008 and then a second round in which the films were released in 2011. All films except the first one was released directly on DVD, while the first film went up to the cinema before it was released on DVD. The films have also been shown countless times on Kanal 5 in Sweden and ARD in Germany, as these have been some of the financiers to the movies. Johan Fälemark and Hillevi Råberg were film producers in the first season while Daniel Ahlqvist added as the third film producer in the second season. * 2007 — Irene Huss — Tatuerad Torso * 2007 — Den krossade tanghästen * 2008 — Nattrond * 2008 — Glasdjävulen * 2008 — Eldsdansen * 2008 — Guldkalven * 2011 — Den som vakar i mörkret * 2011 — Det lömska nätet * 2011 — En man med litet ansikte * 2011 — Tystnadens cirkel * 2011 — I skydd av skuggorna * 2011 — Jagad vittne == References == ==External links== * Video introduction by Helene Tursten (in Swedish) to Irene Huss films made for Swedish TV. * (in Swedish). * Review of Detective Inspector Huss in January Magazine.

The theater, located on \\"Washington's Black Broadway\\", served the city's African American community when segregation kept them out of other venues. The Lincoln Theatre included a movie house and ballroom, and hosted jazz and big band performers such as Duke Ellington. The theater closed after the 1968 race-related riots. It was restored and reopened in 1994, and hosts a variety of performances and events. The U Street Metro station, which opened in 1991, is located across the street from Lincoln Theater. ==History== Construction of the Lincoln Theatre began in the summer of 1921, and it opened in 1922. The Lincoln Theatre, which showed silent film and vaudeville, served the city's black community. The theatre was designed by Reginald Geare, in collaboration with Harry Crandall, a local theater operator. In 1927, the Lincoln Theatre was sold to A.E. Lichtman, who decided to turn it into a luxurious movie house, and added a ballroom. The theatre was wired for sound in 1928. The ballroom, known as Lincoln Colonnade, and the theater were known as the center of \\"Washington's Black Broadway\\". Performers at Lincoln Theatre have included Duke Ellington, Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday, and Sarah Vaughan. A television projection system was installed at Lincoln Theatre in 1952. The movie house televised boxing fights on many occasions, such as the Sugar Ray Robinson-Joey Maxim bout on June 25, 1952. The Lincoln Theatre struggled financially after desegregation opened other movie theaters to blacks beginning in 1953. In the late 1950s, the Colonnade was demolished. The theater fell into disrepair after the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots. In 1978, the Lincoln Theatre was divided into two theaters, and was known as the Lincoln \\"Twins\\". In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Lincoln Theater featured \\"All-Night Movie\\" shows on the weekend, attracting hundreds each weekend. The Lincoln Theatre was sold to developer Jeffrey Cohen in 1983, who closed it for renovations. The theater remained boarded up for many years. ==Restoration== The Lincoln Theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. In 1993, the theatre was restored by the U Street Theatre Foundation, with $9 million of aid from the District of Columbia government. The restoration started in 1989 by developer Jeffrey N. Cohen, who was working on a controversial $250 million redevelopment plan, \\"Jackson Plaza\\", for the Shaw/U-Street area. In 1990, Cohen ran into financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy in 1991. Restoration of the theater was taken over by the District government and the foundation. The restoration work was done by the design firm, Leo A. Daly. The building has a brick exterior, and the interior features Victorian trim. A \\"sneak preview\\" of the renovated theater was held on September 16, 1993 for D.C. Councilmember Frank Smith, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, and 1,000 attendees. The theatre officially reopened on February 4, 1994 with a performance of Barry Scott's Ain't Got Long to Stay Here, which was about the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. In March 1995, Lincoln Theatre hosted a play, Where Eagles Fly, written by local playwright Carole Mumin. The play told the story of a local elderly woman who fought the Shaw Urban Redevelopment Project that targeted the Shaw neighborhood for demolition, and sought to preserve the neighborhood and its history. The 1,250-seat theater has hosted theatrical and musical shows including a 2002 multi-week run of The Jackie Wilson Story from Chicago's Black Ensemble Theatre, and leased space to community groups and for events, and hosted political events such as the mayor's State of the District address. Jazz performances in recent years have included Cassandra Wilson, Quincy Jones, Chuck Brown, and Wynton Marsalis. In 2005, the annual Duke Ellington Jazz Festival was inaugurated and hosted performances. Others that have performed at the Lincoln Theatre include Damien Rice, singer Brian Stokes Mitchell, and comedians Dave Chappelle and Dick Gregory. Lincoln Theatre has also been a venue for Filmfest DC. The theater was the primary venue for the annual LGBT film festival Reel Affirmations from 1998 to 2008. From 2008 to 2010, Arena Stage mounted several productions at the theater, including Carrie Fisher's Wishful Drinking, while its Southwest Waterfront complex was being renovated. The theater struggled financially after re-opening, requiring financial aid from the District government. In 2011, the theatre was threatened with closure after the city cut funding. The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities then took over management, and began searching for a new operator. ==Current operations== In January 2012, the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities began searching for a new entertainment booking group to operate Lincoln Theatre. The process included evaluating business plans from various groups. In April 2013, I.M.P., the company that owns the 9:30 Club and operates Merriweather Post Pavilion, was selected over other competitors to operate the theatre. In June 2013, DC Mayor Vincent Gray, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, and the Deputy of General Services made the official announcement of the selection. Prior to obtaining sole operation of the theatre, I.M.P. had booked a few shows at Lincoln Theatre, including sold-out performances by Jeff Tweedy in 2010 and Jeff Mangum in 2012. I.M.P. began sole operation of the theatre in the fall of 2013.

Finally, she was able to make the soup, but when she put it in the stream to cool, Prince Phivos brought his horse to drink; the pot startled the horse and it would not drink, so the prince kicked the pot over. She cursed him to crave Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa as much as she had the soup. He, consumed with longing, hunted for Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa for three months until he came to the tower with no entrance, where she lived. He saw an ogress (drakaina) approach and call Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa to throw down her hair; the ogress climbed it, ate and drank with Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa, and climbed back down again. The prince called to her, and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa threw down her hair to him. They fell in love. Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa hid him from the ogress, who would have eaten him, and as soon as the ogress left the tower the next morning, they sealed up the mouths of everything in the tower, because all the objects there could speak, and fled. The ogress returned, her daughter did not answer, and the mortar, which the prince and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa had forgotten, told her that they had fled. The ogress chased after them on a bear, but Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa threw down a comb, which became a swamp, and after the ogress passed through that, another comb, which became thorns, and finally a scarf, which became a sea. The ogress could not pass the sea, but she warned Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa that the prince would leave her in a tree while he went to fetch his mother to bring her to the castle, and when he kissed his mother, he would forget her and decide to marry another. When that happened, she should get two pieces of bread dough being prepared for the wedding, and make them into birds. It happened as she said, and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa did as the ogress said. The birds flew to the castle and one questioned the other about what had happened between Prince Phivos and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa. He remembered her, went to the tree where he had left her, and brought her to the castle, where they married. ==Commentary== The heroine's three names mean \\"Blossoming\\", \\"Fair-haired\\", and \\"Golden-haired\\".Soula Mitakidou and Anthony L.

He is known for his portraits. == In the Soviet Union == Pogrebinsky was raised during the Khrushchev Thaw of the Soviet Union, and was witness to a flourishing of artistic creativity that the USSR had not seen since the 1920s. Growing up in an artistic family, Pogrebinsky was constantly surrounded by painters and sculptors. Pogrebinsky's father was an artist, Peter Nikolayevich Pogrebinsky (1911–2002) and Lubov Romanovna Solona (1914–1990). Both of his parents belonged to the USSR Union of Artists, and were masters of the Socialist realism school of art. Pogrebinsky began studying French in 1958, and by the 1970s was fluently communicating with artists in Western Europe. In 1963, after successfully passing the rigid entrance exams, Pogrebinsky was accepted into the only art's high school in Soviet Ukraine. Though eventually becoming a painter like his parents, Pogrebinsky showed remarkable talent in sculpture. In 1970, Pogrebinsky entered the prestigious Kiev State Institute of Fine Art. For six years Pogrebinsky studied painting, culminating in the diploma of an Artist in the Art of Painting, the Ukrainian equivalent of a master's degree. Throughout those years, Pogrebinsky was extremely active in the art world of the Soviet Union. His works were markedly different from the classical trend of Socialist Realism, an example of which can be seen in a watercolor from 1971, \\"In the Gethsemane Garden.\\" At the Kiev State Institute of Fine Arts, Pogrebinsky studied under Academician Victor Vasilievich Shatalin, who was also the People's Artist of the USSR. Sharalin greatly admired Pogrebinsky's skills, and the two artists have remained friends to this day. After Pogrebinsky's graduation from the Kiev State Institute of Fine Arts, he began working as an independent artist, exhibiting in shows across the Soviet Union. In 1978, Pogrebinsky received the Lenin Prize in Art for his painting, \\"Komsomol.\\" In 1978, Pogrebinsky entered The Academy of Fine Art of the USSR, from which he received his Ph.D in Fine Art in 1984. During 1978, Pogrebinsky was also accepted into both the USSR Union of Artists, and the USSR Academy of Arts. Though Pogrebinsky was successful, he refused to join the Communist Party of the USSR, which could have given him even more success. While studying at the Academy, Pogrebinsky worked in the studio of Sergei Alexievich Grigoriev, who was also an Academician and a People's Artist of the USSR. At the Academy, Pogrebinsky worked under the supervision of Aleksei Gritsai. Throughout his years as an artist in the Soviet Union, Pogrebinsky's works appeared on magazine covers, posters, and in national and international exhibitions. Many of his paintings were commissioned by the Ministry of Culture. Though many paintings were commissioned by Soviet officials, Pogrebinsky worked prolifically on many projects outside of Soviet officials. His paintings such as \\"Bulgakov\\" (1988), \\"Vrubel\\" (1988), \\"In the Beginning,\\" and \\"Creation,\\" touched on themes not often accepted in the Soviet Union at the time. In the 1980s, Pogrebinsky began using his family as models for many of his paintings, a practice that continues to this day. His family has been used in the following paintings: \\"When The Gods Were Near, Le Louvre, Earth, Sun, Moon, Gold #2, Hiroshima, Let There Be Sunshine, The War, The Muse, Natasha.\\" Pogrebinsky has used himself as a model in \\"Bulgakov\\" and \\"Where Is The Truth?\\" The 1980s brought Pogrebinsky increasing popularity with his social and political art, most of which focused on the inhumanity of war. Despite his success, including material benefits such as owning a car and enjoying a comfortable existence, Pogrebinsky still refused to join the Communist Party, and was weary of the future in the stagnant Soviet Union. With the tragedy of Chernobyl, Pogrebinsky seriously began considering immigration. In a 1994 article in the Plain Dealer: > They [the Pogrebinsky's] had long doubted the benevolence of the government, > but the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 60 miles from their > home, cemented their destruct.

After traveling through Europe, the family arrived in New York City in January 1991, where they were granted political asylum by the U.S. Government. == In the United States == As soon as Pogrebinsky arrived in the United States, he began exhibiting and painting. Some of his earliest paintings dealt with religious and philosophical themes, as in \\"Where Is The Truth?,\\" a painting depicting Jesus Christ before Pontius Pilate. In the 1990s, Pogrebinsky worked largely in oils and watercolors. He has painted the portraits of many religious leaders in the United States, and has taught Art and Painting at the Cleveland Institute of Art and John Caroll University. As in the USSR, Pogrebinsky received many commissions, and became increasingly known for his realistic portraits. Notable among his personal works of this period is the triptych \\"Moon, Earth, Sun.\\" A whole series of rose paintings appeared in 1998 and continues to the present day. These are some of his most successful and recognizable works. Since immigrating to the United States, Pogrebinsky has shown his work across the country and around the world. In 2008, Pogrebinsky's work was displayed at the Ukrainian Embassy to the United States, in Washington D.C.http://www.mfa.gov.ua/usa/en/news/init/main/1.htm?date=2008-5-16 Pogrebinsky's wife Lena currently works for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, where she has taught high school mathematics at Lincoln-West High School, Whitney M. Young Gifted & Talented Leadership Academy and James Ford Rhodes High School. Pogrebinsky's Daughter, Natasha, competed on Chopped, an American cooking competition, season 16 episode 14, 'Walk on the Whelk Side', where Natasha shares her memories as a child fleeing Russia. == Philosophy == It was in high school that Pogrebinsky became interested in Yoga and Eastern philosophy. Though literature on Yoga and Buddhism was extremely difficult to come by in the Soviet Union, Pogrebinsky was able to acquire literature in French from the West, and in some cases Russian samizdat copies. Pogrebinsky was highly influenced by the philosophy that was rarely talked about in the secular USSR. Pogrebinsky's themes often gravitate towards the religious and psychological. And though Pogrebinsky is of no particular faith, his paintings show a universal interest in religions. Several works since the 1970s depict Jesus Christ. His triptych Earth, Moon, Sun explores the individual and the forces of good and evil. Inspired by the philosophical writings of Goethe, Pogrebinsky included lines from Faust within the paintings. Many of his paintings deal with creation myths. ==References== == External links == *Alexander Pogrebinsky Official Site *Pogrebinsky on Ask-Art.com *Pogrebinsky on Art-Ring *Interview with Alexander Pogrebinsky, 2003 *Online Gallery Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:1951 births Category:Living people ","title":"Alexander Pogrebinsky"},{"id":"9083194","text":"The Quaraí or Cuareim River (Portuguese Rio Quaraí, Spanish Río Cuareim) is a tributary of the Uruguay River. ==Location== The river originates in the Coxilha de Santana (Spanish Cuchilla de Santa Ana), an area of low-lying hills, and runs westward to join the Uruguay River.

All four generators (two low pressure generators and two high pressure/intermediate pressure generators) are Westinghouse generators. The low pressure, intermediate pressure and high pressure steam turbines were originally Westinghouse units, but were replaced over time with Alstom steam-path upgraded components. The turbine valves are the originally installed Westinghouse equipment. The plant employs multiple pollution control systems, including a selective catalytic reducer which removes nitrogen oxides, an electrostatic precipitator which removes fly ash, and low NOx burners in the boiler.

Jephson was a right- handed middle order batsman. But his enduring fame rests on his reputation as one of the last lob bowlers, bowling slow right-arm underarm lobs. His action was described as a little like setting a wood in crown green bowling. In fact, he started as an overarm right-handed fast bowler, but switched to lobs with great success when he took up regular county cricket in the late 1890s. ==Life== Lobster\\" Jephson as caricatured by Spy (Leslie Ward) in Vanity Fair, May 1902 Digby Jephson was the son of Cuthbert Armroid Jephson of Clapham. He was educated at Manor House School in Clapham and at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Despite fairly modest achievements, Jephson won his Blue at Cambridge for three years from 1890 to 1892, and he played for Surrey regularly in 1894, again without distinction. He barely played in 1895, and not at all in 1896, but from July 1897 he returned to regular county cricket with Surrey and appeared in most matches for the next five and half seasons. He scored more than 1,000 runs in the four seasons from 1898 to 1901, with a best of 1,952 runs, average 41.53, in 1900, when he appeared in 38 first-class matches. His lob bowling seemed to get more effective with the passing years. In 1899 he took 6 for 21 in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's which the Gentlemen won by an innings. In 1900 he took 66 wickets and the following year he managed 77, including career best figures of seven for 51 against Gloucestershire at The Oval. Jephson captained Surrey from 1900 to 1902, but stood down before the end of the 1902 season, and thereafter appeared only a few times in first-class cricket. Aside from his first-class career, he was also a prolific batsman in London club cricket, in particular for the touring side Wanderers.

The station's activities reached their peak in late 1962 and early 1963 - the period of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Under Ted Shackley's leadership from 1962 to 1965, JMWAVE grew to be the largest CIA station in the world outside of the organization's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, with 300 to 400 professional operatives (possibly including about 100 based in Cuba) as well as an estimated 15,000 anti-Castro Cuban exiles on its payroll. The CIA was one of Miami's largest employers during this period. Exiles were trained in commando tactics, espionage and seamanship and the station supported numerous exile raids on Cuba.\\"How the Kennedys hoped to take down Castro\\" (review of Bohning's book), Joseph C. Goulden, Washington Times, July 24, 2005 The main front company for JMWAVE was \\"Zenith Technical Enterprises, Inc.\\" In addition, about 300 to 400 other front companies were created throughout South Florida with a large range of \\"safe houses\\", cover businesses and other properties. With an annual budget of approx.

It also operated a fleet of aircraft and boats - this has been described as the third largest navy in the Caribbean at the time after the main US and Cuban navies. JMWAVE's activities were so widespread that they became an open secret amongst local Florida government and law enforcement agencies. On June 26, 1964, Look magazine published an exposé by David Wise and Thomas B. Ross which revealed that Zenith was a CIA front. The University of Miami authorities denied knowledge of the CIA operation (though Shackley would claim privately that University President Henry King Stanford was fully aware) and JMWAVE changed its main front company name from Zenith to \\"Melmar Corporation\\". By 1968, JMWAVE was increasingly regarded as obsolete. There was also concern that the station would become a public embarrassment to the University of Miami. Consequently, it was deactivated and replaced with a substantially smaller station at Miami Beach. As of 2004, the facilities on the Richmond Naval Air Station site were still used by several US government agencies, including the CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, the United States Air Force and the United States Army. Several original JMWAVE buildings were still standing.

He was born in 1920 in the village of Pano Lefkara. He was educated at the Pancyprian Gymnasium and then studied medicine at the University of Athens. ==Political career== He became involved in politics early on in his life as a medical student in Athens, campaigning for Enosis (Union of Cyprus with Greece), and as a doctor he took an active part in the armed anti-colonial struggle of EOKA for Enosis against the British (1955-1959). He participated in the London conference in 1959 for the establishment of Cyprus independence and, along with Tassos Papadopoulos, were the only ones to disagree with the Zurich-London Agreements. In 1960 he was elected member of the first parliament of the Cyprus Republic as a candidate for the Patriotic Front, and since then has been re-elected to all the consecutive parliaments. In November 1964, Lyssarides and Tassos Papadopoulos organized the visit of Andreas Papandreou (son of then-Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou) to Cyprus; during this visit, a very close friendship developed between Papandreou and Archbishop Makarios; later, after the imposition of the military junta in Greece, Lyssarides was instrumental in assisting Papandreou and his Panhellenic Liberation Movement (PAK) with arms, money and training.Τσίμας, Κώστας (2004).

Bust-a-Move DS has received a score of 75/100 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Matthew Kumar of Eurogamer felt that the touchscreen slingshot controls were interesting and mechanically satisfying, but found them useless on later levels due to how much longer it takes to use them, making it more difficult to beat these levels. They found the use of the two screens to be good, and praised the multiplayer experience, though noting that the lack of online makes it harder to enjoy it. Meanwhile, Ryan Davis of GameSpot found the touchscreen support to be solid, praising the multiplayer and number of levels to play, while expressing disappointment over its \\"weak AI\\" and difficulty aiming with the Nintendo DS' directional pad. Tom Orry of Video Gamer called its gameplay \\"fiendishly addictive,\\" though they lamented that the gameplay was \\"more of the same.\\" They also noted that the touchscreen option allows for more precision than the directional pad controls. Craig Harris of IGN similarly found the touchscreen controls valuable to a \\"classic\\" game, though he wished there were more new things added to the game. Jon Jordan of Pocket Gamer praised it as simple but with \\"strategic depth,\\" though felt the lack of extra modes held it back. The X-Play review also wished there was more new to it, though noted that it was \\"still one of the best on-the-go puzzle games\\" and that the game made good use of both the touchscreen and the dual screens. ==References== Category:505 Games Category:2005 video games Category:Bubble Bobble Category:Majesco Entertainment games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Taito games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Bust-a-Move DS"},{"id":"9083397","text":"Lynnville Township is located in Ogle County, Illinois.

Among them are the Philippines, Japan, and Singapore. The fights that occur in the Philippines and in Japan are staged between females of various species of web weavers. Female spiders will kill a rival if the loser does not quickly flee or receive the aid of a human handler. The contests that are staged in Singapore are fights between male jumping spiders. The males fight only for dominance, and ordinarily the loser will flee, though sometimes they will lose a leg in the fight. In the Philippines, spider fighting (Hiligaynon: paupas sang damang; Cebuano: paaway kaka or sabong sa kaka) is staged between female orb-weavers from the genus Neoscona. In Japan, the contests occur at an annual festival and use females of the genus Argiope. In Japanese these contests are called Kumo Gassen (spider battles). In Singapore, they use males of the genus Thiania - most commonly the species Thiania bhamoensis - although another species of that genus may sometimes be used. Like cockfighting, spider fighting is a sport that usually involves betting and events occur frequently. In Singapore, they are known as \\"fighting spiders\\" in English and dòu zhī zhū (, \\"fighting spiders\\") in Mandarin Chinese, analogous to the Chinese term for gamecocks, dòu jī (, \\"fighting chickens\\"). ==Philippines== Neoscona punctigera, one of the most common species caught for spider derbies in the Philippines Spider fighting or spider wrestling (Hiligaynon: pahibag sang damang; Cebuano: paaway kaka or sabong sa kaka; Mindanao Cebuano: sabong sa damang) is a popular blood sport among rural Filipino children, especially in the Bisaya region. The game begins by placing two spiders at opposite ends of a stick. The spiders are then prodded to move along the length of the stick until they encounter each other and fight. ===Catching=== Matchbox serving as a 'stable' for fighting spiders in between derbies Spiders suitable for spider fighting are almost always adult female orb-weavers from the genus Neoscona. Only the spiders coming from this genus are called damang or kaka (or in English as \\"derby spiders\\" or \\"fighting spiders\\"). The most commonly utilized species is Neoscona punctigera, but other species used include: Neoscona aldinei, Neoscona ampoyae, Neoscona facundoi, Neoscona lipana, Neoscona marauoyi, Neoscona nautica, Neoscona rumpfi, Neoscona shereeae, Neoscona theisi, and Neoscona vigilans. The spiders are usually caught in trees and bushes in the early morning or during dusk when the spiders come out to spin webs. After capture or in-between fights, the spiders are stabled in used matchboxes. These matchboxes usually have separate cells to house several spiders. The cells are normally made from discarded cardboard or a single blade of coconut leaf bent several times inside the matchbox. Some trainers assemble a \\"langsaranan\\" where the spider is released to a plant enclosed by a net or a plastic bottle with tiny holes. ===Fighting=== Most spider fights are done with a single piece of dried coconut leaf midrib (usually taken from a broom made from such midribs; Cebuano: gungi, Tagalog: walis tingting) or bamboo. Spiders are placed at both ends and encouraged to move toward each other and fight. The sticks are thin enough to ensure that the spiders have no choice but to meet. It is held by one child who ensures that the spiders do not escape by alternately switching grip from one end to the other. How a fight ends is agreed upon beforehand. Fights to the death will end with one spider being bitten, paralyzed, and swiftly wrapped in silk. Non-lethal matches end when one spider falls from the stick (once or several times, depending on the agreement). Occasionally, the child holding the stick may need to quickly intervene in a non-lethal fight to prevent the winning spider from eating the losing spider. More formal fights, called \\"kaka derbies\\" are held in an arena made of two poles connected by a tight string. Underneath is a padding (usually polystyrene foam) to ensure that the spiders are not injured in case they fall down. A fight that includes large sums of money normally has a kuyme (referee) similar to cockfighting. ===Legal issues=== The practice is now generally discouraged since it affects the educational performance of school children. Top fighters can fetch up to 100 pesos (US$ 2), making the sport lucrative for children. They could spend so much time hunting and training spiders that lessons and homework are neglected. Adults also play the sport but in a way similar to cockfighting. Derbies are also held and bets could go as high as 50,000 pesos (about US$1,000). The cheaper maintenance cost of raising spiders compared to raising fighting cocks caused some players to switch to spider fighting. Ordinances against the sport are now in effect in some cities. In the Negros Occidental province, spider derbies are treated as a threat to public morals. The Bacolod police provincial director issued an order warning residents of participating in a form of illegal gambling. The police also say that spider fighting in itself is not illegal as a pasttime but it will be considered illegal once people place bets on the fights. ==Japan== Argiope amoena An annual spider fighting contest called Kumo Gassen is held in Kajiki, Kagoshima, Japan. The spiders used in this contest belong to the genus Argiope. This form of spider fighting is said to have been around as far back as the 16th century. It is done in a similar manner to Philippine spider-fights. One spider, designated as the \\"Kamae\\" is placed on the end of a stick, while another spider called the \\"Shikake\\" is placed on the other end. The spiders will then fight each other in the middle. The contest is a tournament, with the last two victorious spiders fighting each other in the finale. ==Singapore== Thiania bhamoensis Spiders used in spider derbies in Singapore come from the species Thiania bhamoensis (also called \\"Fighting Spider\\"), a jumping spider. The practice has been the subject of a memoir entitled Spider Boys, and a popular television series in Singapore called Fighting Spiders. Capturing, admiring, nurturing, and staging fights among these spiders is a popular activity among many young people. The practice had a relatively large financial impact on those young people who participate in these practices both because of the sale value of a strong contender and also because of the bets made on their fights. Mainly in the 60s, 70s. ==United States== In the United States, spider-fighting is also prevalent in prisons in Florida, where inmates catch them and keep them in boxes as pets. In 2002, a fight between three inmates over the theft of a pet spider resulted in life-threatening skull injuries to one inmate and additional charges to the other two. ==Gallery== Image:Spider fight 1.jpgTwo fighting spiders of approximately equal size and weight are placed at opposite ends of a bamboo skewer Image:Spider fight 2.jpgTop frame: Both spiders size each other up; Bottom frame: The spiders grapple; at this point, one of the spiders may have already delivered a paralyzing bite to its opponent's body Image:Spider fight 3.jpgThe victor begins to wrap its victim in silk.

As the only witness to the scene between Jack and Lane on the night of the latter's unexpected return when Jack was to marry the girl, Buck uses Lane's payment of a mortgage to cast evidence upon him that he was the robber and murderer of a local express agent. However, McKee himself committed the crime. His original lie confessed, Jack is sent by his bride out into the desert to bring Lane back. Sheriff Slim Hoover (Arbuckle) follows Jack based upon the strength of McKee's accusations.

It was directed by Ján Kadár and stars Jeffrey Lynas as an orthodox Jewish boy growing up in 1920s Montreal. The film received the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film in 1975. The original story was written by Ted Allan in 1949. Allan was working at an advertising agency. David Rome, editor of the Canadian Jewish Congress Bulletin, asked him to write a story. Allan's short story is as a dramatization of his own childhood memories. Allan comes from a Jewish family who lived in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood. Lies My Father Told Me has been through many reincarnations since its original publication, as a radio play and a Golden Globe winning film. The original short story was picked up by producer Harry Gulkin. Gulkin candidly told the Montreal Gazette, \\"I really didn't know what I was doing, but then nobody knew I didn't know what I was doing\\". The film has become celebrated for its message that relationships can deeply transcend generations through the connection between its two main characters. Marilyn Lightstone, who portrays a leading character, also comments on the film's ability to engage with a mass audience. Lightstone told the Montreal Gazette in 2011 that she is unsurprised that Lies still widely resonates with viewers nearly 45 years after its debut. Lightstone states, \\"it is essentially a family story with the most primal set of conflicts you can come upon. It's why Oedipus and Hamlet still resonate. It's a universal theme\\". ==Plot== David is a six-year-old boy in a Jewish ghetto of Montreal in the 1920s. He lives with his parents Harry and Annie and his grandfather Zaida, a rag-and-bone man who collects rags and bottles on his horse and wagon, while also studying the Talmud and claiming it as the only book he has read. David loves riding with his grandfather, and shares Zaida's love for Ferdeleh, despite the horse's age and the neighbour Mrs. Tannenbaum's complaints as to the smell. Zaida jokes about covering Mrs. Tannenbaum's steps with horse excrement, an idea that delights David, who takes it seriously. While Zaida's friend Mr. Baumgarten embraces the ideas of Karl Marx to end social class injustice, Zaida replies he is instead looking to the arrival of the messiah to end all injustice. Harry, who is not religious, designs a pair of trousers meant to be impossible to crease, and appeals to Zaida for $500 in investment, claiming he already has many orders for the product and will be able to pay back with interest in one month. When Harry demonstrates his \\"pressless trousers\\", his own business partner points out the bulges in the knees, spoiling any chance Zaida will invest. Enraged, Harry rants about marrying into an unintelligent family, condemns Zaida as a miser and not a real Orthodox Jew, and says Ferdeleh should be killed. David overhears these threats made by his father and is disturbed and embarrassed for the way he has spoken of his family, particularly Zaida. In attempt to comfort his grandfather, David informs Zaida that his father tells \\"terrible lies\\". While David hopes to ride with Zaida on another Sunday, Harry insists instead on taking David fishing. However, Harry actually takes David to a gambling club, and talks of leaving the ghetto behind. With orders on the defective trousers cancelled, Harry goes into bankruptcy and the family's plans to move are cancelled, to David's joy. Annie gives birth to David's baby brother, and David becomes jealous his brother gets to breastfeed. Finally disillusioned with the deceptions of all adults, David covers Mrs. Tannenbaum's steps with horse excrement. The police arrive and discover Zaida's stable is in violation of bylaws requiring stables to be located 100 yards from residences. The police give Zaida 30 days to move it, but he resolves not to. He instead becomes gravely ill, and David is sent to his uncle to avoid a spread of the illness. When he returns, Harry tells David that Zaida and Ferdeleh have both died. Distressed, David runs from home and imagines his grandfather returning. ==Cast== * Yossi Yadin as Zaida * Len Birman as Harry Herman * Marilyn Lightstone as Annie Herman * Jeffery Lynas as David Herman * Ted Allan as Mr. Baumgarten * Henry Gamer as Uncle Benny * Barbara Chilcott as Mrs. Tannenbaum * Carole Lazare as Edna * Mignon Elkins as Mr. Bondy * Cleo Paskal as Cleo ==Production== Lies My Father Told Me was entirely filmed in Montreal. The Film's use of Mount Royal and The Plateau has been widely appreciated by audiences for these locations' \\"stunning\\" visual aesthetics. Telefilm Canada, formerly known as the Canadian Film Development Corporation, is the Crown Corporation that produced the film and is fittingly headquartered in Montreal. Lies My Father Told Me was produced just a year before the CFDC's annual budget was increased to $25 million by the Federal Government of Canada. ==Reception== Producer Harry Gulkin believes that the film's strong reception within the Jewish Mile Neighbourhood in Montreal is due to its considerable \\"local sensibility\\". However, he states that in addition to this evident ability in capturing local communities, the film entails very basic, universal ideas and messages that are \\"recognizable to audiences everywhere\\". The film has been appreciated for providing a diverse, deep portrayal of Montreal, significantly contrasting with traditional depictions of \\"La Belle Ville\\". Jeffery Lynas, who makes his film debut in Lies My Father Told Me, has been acclaimed for portraying \\"innocence, love, and genuine conviction\\". The film has been described by the New York Times as not being about lies, but rather \\"the harsh truths the boy cannot understand or accept\\", in reference to Lynas' character. Lies My Father Told Me has been adapted into a stage musical. The Montreal-based Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre produced the first and one of the most well-received musicals of Lies My Father Told Me. The first version of the musical was produced by Dora Wasserman at the Segal Centre in 1984. The musical was then adapted by Dora's daughter, Bryna, into the production it is today. The production, which made its debut in June 2005, uses a cast of just above 30 members and has been praised for \\"making nostalgia and sentiment work in a big way\\". The theatre production includes the construction of over 12 original songs to portray Allan's plot. The film was the highest-grossing Canadian film in Canada for the year, with a gross of $650,000, winning the inaugural Golden Reel Award. ==Awards== * Academy Award nominee for Best Screenplay * Canadian Film Awards – Film of the Year, Adapted Screenplay, Actress (Marilyn Lightstone), Sound * Golden Reel Award * Golden Globes – Best Foreign Film ==References* Category:1975 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:1975 drama films Category:Best Foreign Language Film Golden Globe winners Category:Films directed by Ján Kadár Category:Films shot in Montreal Category:Films set in Montreal Category:Films about Jews and Judaism Category:Jews and Judaism in Montreal Category:Best Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Jewish Canadian films Category:Films scored by Sol Kaplan ","title":"Lies My Father Told Me"},{"id":"9083500","text":"The House of Canossa, also known as the Attonids, was an Italian noble family, holding the castle of Canossa, from the early tenth to the early twelfth century.

That's the story of your life.\\" ==Structure== In the novel Isherwood derives meaning and emotion from those around him. The novel's four sections describe four people who influenced him. Mr Lancaster introduces the young Christopher to the danger of asceticism. Ambrose inadvertently warns Christopher of isolationism. Waldemar embodies the surreality of heterosexual marriage. Finally, Isherwood encounters a famous male prostitute named Paul. The two men resolve to explore a regimented spiritual lifestyle centered on self-denial and meditation. ==Plot== Throughout the novel Isherwood is a character of extremes. At times he pursues physical pleasure, relentlessly devoting himself to debauchery, but he interrupts these binges with periods of discipline, learning German or regularly meditating. Somehow his abandon never leads to personal disaster. The second section of the novel contains a scene that illustrates this pattern. Isherwood is visiting an island where a crew of inane Greeks blast rock for the foundations of a mansion. He observes that: > Despite all their experience, they seem to have no idea how much dynamite > they should use. It is always too little or too much. We become completely > indifferent to their yells of warning, followed by an absurd little > firecracker pop.

Important editors and researchers of this material include Abraham ben Elijah of Vilna, Adolf Jellinek, and Solomon Aaron Wertheimer. == Principal works == The chief of these works are: * Midrash Abba Gorion, a late midrash to the Book of Esther * Midrash Abkir, on the first two books of the Torah. Only fragments survive. * Midrash Al Yithallel, stories about David, Solomon, and the rich Korah * Midrash Aseret ha-Dibrot, a haggadah for Shavuot * Chronicle of Moses (or Divrei ha-Yamim shel Mosheh) * Midrash Eleh Ezkerah, on the execution of the ten sages by the Roman emperor Hadrian. * Midrash Eser Galiyyot, the ten exiles of the Jews up to the time of Hadrian. * Midrash Esfah, on verses from the books of Numbers and Deuteronomy.

The park's elevation ranges from 800–1260 meters, with a humid climate. Average annual precipitation is 1700 mm, with rainfall on 210 days of each year. This rainforest is habitat to a vast species biodiversity, including many endemic rare species and endangered species, including 11 lemur species. The park's two component parts are Mantadia National Park and Analamazoatra Reserve, which is best known for its population of Madagascar's largest lemur, the indri. The national park was nominated in 2007 to become part of the World Heritage Site of Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Africa, Rainforests of the Atsinanana, Madagascar\\" . UNESCO Organization. However, its forests were not selected for the final list.Rainforests of the . UNESCO Organization. This is one of the easiest parks in Madagascar to visit from the capital city, Antananarivo, with a 3-hour drive east on a paved road, Route Nationale 2 (RN 2). While Analamazaotra and park headquarters are short walks from Antsapanana on the RN 2, special transport must be arranged or hired from local hotels to reach Mantadia. Hikes ranging from 1–6 hours are typically available in both parts of the park. A local guide is required for visitors entering either part of the park.Lonely Planet - Parc National de Mantadia ==History== The Analamazaotra (or Périnet) Special Reserve (ASR), known locally as Andasibe after the nearby village, was once part of the larger Mantadia National Park which also included Maromizaha Classified Forest to the southeast and Anosibe an’ala to the south. However logging and deforestation for farming has resulted in these parks now being isolated. The main threat to this park comes from the disappearance of adjoining habitat outside the park. This disappearance has been caused primarily by logging and replacement of rain- forest with commercial Australian eucalyptus and Chinese pine forests, and to a lesser extent by slash-and-burn cultivation for rice agriculture, which is exacerbated by the extremely high population growth rate and poverty in rural Madagascar. ==Reintroduction program== Diademed sifaka with radio collar Diademed sifaka with 2-week-old baby To address the disappearing habitat threat, reserves have been created in the vicinity of Andasibe-Mantadia that balance resource extraction with environmental protection, and attempt to create economic and environmentally preferable alternatives to replacing native forests with eucalyptus and pine. In 2006, the Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership and Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium, in collaboration with Madagascar National Parks and Eaux et Fôret initiated the Analamazaotra Re- introduction/Translocation (ART) project to reintroduce two endangered species of lemur back into the park. The aim was to take lemurs from threatened areas where habitat loss means the incumbent population is unsustainable, and relocate them to the relative safety of the Analamazaotra Special Reserve. The program followed the IUCN re-introduction/translocation guidelines, with family group monitoring before and after translocation. By 2014, the ART project had reintroduced three group comprising 26 diademed sifaka and 8 black-and-white ruffed lemur into the park. The project's multi-disciplinary team tracked the reintroduced groups using radio collars, and collected fecal samples to evaluate biomedical, genetic, habitat, nutritional and reproductive characteristics of the lemurs. The project has so far been very successful, and visitors to this popular reserve have been lucky enough to see two generations of babies born at the park. The ART project also helps the local community by education and provides two local guides.

Reina, 495 U.S. 676 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court concluded that Indian tribes could not prosecute Indians who were members of other tribes for crimes committed by those nonmember Indians on their reservations. The decision was not well received by the tribes, because it defanged their criminal codes by depriving them of the power to enforce them against anyone except their own members. In response, Congress amended a section of the Indian Civil Rights Act, , to include the power to \\"exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians\\" as one of the powers of self-government. == Background == Map of Maricopa County showing Salt River Indian Reservation in red === Reservation === The Salt River Indian Reservation, located to the east of Scottsdale, Arizona, is home to the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community. The reservation was established in 1879 by executive order to recognize the occupation of the land by Pima and Maricopa Indians., 33 (1999); 3 806-07 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904). The Indians moved from the Gila River Indian Reservation due to white settlers upstream diverting water from the Gila River to the point that the Indians could no longer farm there. at 33; Report in the Matter of the Investigation of the Salt and Gila Rivers: Reservations and Reclamation Service, Before the H. Comm. on the Interior, 62d Cong. 4 (1913). Although the Indians had complained at the Gila River reservation, nothing was done to stop the theft of their water, where at the Salt River, the tribes were upstream of the settlers and did not have the same problem.H. Comm. on the Interior Report at 4-5. In 1926, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) created a Pima Advisory Council and in 1934 the two tribes adopted a constitution for the reservation., 61-63 (2000). The current constitution dates from 1940. at 61-63. === Facts === Albert Duro was not a member of the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community. He was from California and was a member of the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians;, 108 (2009). thus, he was not eligible for membership in the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, and could not vote in tribal elections, hold tribal office, or serve on tribal juries. Duro lived on the Salt River Indian Reservation at 108. with a \\"woman friend\\" and worked for the tribe's construction company, PiCopa Construction. In 1984, he was accused of killing a 14-year-old boy inside the boundaries of the reservation. Initially, Duro was charged with murder and aiding and abetting murder in federal court, but the prosecution dismissed those charges without prejudice. Duro was handed over to Salt River tribal authorities, who charged Duro with illegally firing a weapon because under federal law, Indian tribes are limited to prosecuting misdemeanor crimes. The tribal courts denied Duro's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and then Duro filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The district court granted the writ and ordered Duro released. Under Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, , the tribal court had no jurisdiction over non-Indians. If the district court were to find that the tribal court had jurisdiction over Indians who were not members of the tribe, it reasoned that would violate the equal protection guarantee of freedom from discrimination based on race. The Ninth Circuit reversed. It read the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Wheeler, , which stated that tribal courts do not have jurisdiction over nonmembers, as supported by an \\"equivocal\\" history, and concluded that federal statutory law allowed tribal jurisdiction over all Indians, not simply members. Finally, it concluded that holding that tribes lacked criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers would create a \\"jurisdictional void,\\" since only the state might have the power to prosecute the nonmember, and the state may lack the power or resources to do so. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Ninth Circuit's decision. ==Opinion of the Court== In an opinion by Justice Kennedy, the Court described this case as falling at the \\"intersection\\" of its prior decisions in Oliphant and Wheeler. In Oliphant, the Court held that the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes did not allow them to have criminal jurisdiction over non- Indians who commit crimes on the reservation. And in Wheeler, the Court held that tribes retain their jurisdiction to prosecute their members for crimes committed on the reservation. The question this case posed was whether \\"the sovereignty retained by the tribes in their dependent status within our scheme of government includes the power of criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers.\\" The Court reasoned that the decisions in Oliphant and Wheeler compelled a negative answer to this question. The sovereignty retained by the Indian tribes is \\"of a unique and limited character.\\" A fully sovereign government would have the power to prosecute all crimes that take place within its territorial boundaries, but the Indian tribes are no longer sovereign in that sense. The sovereignty retained by the tribes to prosecute their own members stems from their power to govern themselves in order to maintain \\"their own unique customs and social order.\\" When the tribes were relegated to dependents of the federal government, they did not lose this inherent power. Rather, the tribes were divested only of the power to regulate relations between themselves and nonmembers. The distinction between members and nonmembers is the critical distinction in this case, not the distinction between Indian and non-Indians. Thus, states may not impose taxes on transactions between members that take place on reservations, because this would interfere with the sovereignty of tribes vis-à-vis their own members. Tribes also retain the power to regulate hunting on lands they own or lands held in trust for them by the United States, but not on lands held in fee. And although other decisions of the Court had recognized broader retained powers in the civil context, criminal powers of Indian tribes were strictly limited to members because \\"the exercise of criminal jurisdiction subjects a person not only to the adjudicatory power of the tribunal, but also to the prosecuting power of the tribe, and involves a far more direct intrusion on personal liberties.\\" Thus, Indian tribes may only prosecute members for crimes committed on their reservations. Because Duro was not a member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, that tribe did not have the power to prosecute him for the crime of illegally firing a weapon. The tribes argued that, historically, tribes had jurisdiction over all Indians regardless of membership. For example, federal statutes used the word \\"Indian\\" without regard to membership, to refer to the \\"family of Indians.\\" Courts of \\"Indian offenses,\\" established by the Department of the Interior for tribes without their own functioning court systems, historically exercised jurisdiction over all Indians without regard to membership, and continue to do so. But the Court responded that federal statutes had always referred to federal programs, and never to the power of tribes with respect to individual Indians. \\"The historical record prior to the creation of modern tribal courts shows little federal attention to the individual tribes' powers as between themselves or over one another's members. Scholars who do find treaties or other sources illuminating have only divided in their conclusions.\\" After the federal government allowed the tribes to \\"express [their] retained tribal sovereignty\\" by creating their own tribal courts, the Secretary of the Interior still had to approve the legal codes the tribes created before the courts of Indian offenses would yield to the tribes own courts. Written opinions of the Solicitor General of the Department of the Interior consistently affirmed the power of the tribes over their own members, but went no further. In light of the historical record, the Court was not \\"persuaded that external criminal jurisdiction is an accepted part of the courts' function.\\" The Court could not ignore the fact that Duro was also a citizen of the United States, entitled to all the privileges and immunities that attach to that status. One right a citizen of the United States enjoys is the right to due process of law, which protects them from \\"unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty. Criminal trial and punishment is so serious and intrusion on personal liberty that its exercise over non-Indian citizens was a power necessarily surrendered by the tribes in their submission to the overriding sovereignty of the United States.\\" Tribal courts do not necessarily afford defendants the full range of protections afforded defendants in federal courts by the Bill of Rights. Because tribal members may participate in tribal governance, the Court approves of tribal members being subject to the criminal jurisdiction of their own tribes. Because nonmembers do not participate in tribal governance, the Court felt it was too great an intrusion to allow tribes to prosecute nonmembers. Finally, the Court rejected the argument that not allowing tribes to prosecute nonmembers, those nonmembers would escape prosecution altogether for criminal activity engaged in within tribal boundaries. The federal government retains the power to prosecute felonies that take place on reservations. Tribes retain the power to expel undesirable persons. Tribal authorities may still arrest the nonmember and detain him until he can be handed over to authorities who do have the power to prosecute the nonmember. The tribe pointed out that state authorities can lack the power to prosecute crimes committed by nonmembers on reservations; Arizona, for instance, expressly disclaims this prosecutorial authority. But Congress has allowed states to assume this power, and Arizona is free to take up Congress's invitation. Finally, if the tribes still believed that there remained a \\"jurisdictional void,\\" despite these options, they could persuade Congress to give it to them. ===Dissenting opinion=== Justice Brennan disagreed that the Court's holding did not create a jurisdictional void. \\"The existence of a jurisdictional gap is not an independent justification for finding tribal jurisdiction, but rather is relevant to determining congressional intent. The unlikelihood that Congress intended to create a jurisdictional void in which no sovereign has the power to prosecute an entire class of crimes should inform our understanding of the assumptions about tribal power upon which Congress legislated.\\" Accordingly, Justice Brennan believed the Court should have read the historical evidence in such a way that supported Congress's intent to allow Indian tribes to exert jurisdiction over nonmembers. Furthermore, Justice Brennan did not accept the Court's argument that the fact that nonmembers were citizens of the United States counseled against allowing tribes to exert jurisdiction over nonmembers. If that was true, he said, it would also be true that tribes could not exert jurisdiction over their own members either. Nor had the Court ever held that participation in the political process was a prerequisite to exercising criminal jurisdiction over a citizen. If this were true, then states could never prosecute nonresidents or aliens. ==Aftermath== Congress quickly addressed the jurisdictional gap that emerged from the Court's ruling by amending the Indian Civil Rights Act in 1990 as part of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1991, which was signed into law on November 5, 1990.Pub. L. 101-511 § 8077(b)Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, Apr. 11, 1968, (codified as amended at ). Nearly fourteen years later, the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of this amendment to 25 U.S.C. § 1301(2) in United States v. Lara (2004), upholding the amendment to the Indian Civil Rights Act and effectively overturning Duro v. Reina. ==See also== * Tribal sovereignty in the United States * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 495 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court == References Commentary from the National Conference of State Legislatures Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Native American criminal jurisdiction case law Category:1990 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court ","title":"Duro v.

The film received critical acclaim, but was a box office failure, and Haasan had to work seven to eight years to recover from the loss he faced through this film. Nevertheless, his performance earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor, and over time, the film has attained cult status. Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Rajadhyaksha Willemen described Srinivasa Rao's direction and Haasan's performance as \\"unabashedly melodramatic, milking the hero's disability for all its worth\\" and that Srinivasa Rao's zooms and cutaways underlined by \\"rapid and awkward editing\\" were \\"fully in evidence\\".

Boston Latin School was founded in 1635 and is both the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States. The first free taxpayer-supported public school in North America, the Mather School, was opened in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1639. Cremin (1970) stresses that colonists tried at first to educate by the traditional English methods of family, church, community, and apprenticeship, with schools later becoming the key agent in \\"socialization.\\" At first, the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family, assuming the parents had those skills. Literacy rates were much higher in New England because much of the population had been deeply involved in the Protestant Reformation and learned to read in order to read the Scriptures. Literacy was much lower in the South, where the Anglican Church was the established church. Single working-class people formed a large part of the population in the early years, arriving as indentured servants. The planter class did not support public education but arranged for private tutors for their children, and sent some to England at appropriate ages for further education. By the mid-19th century, the role of the schools in New England had expanded to such an extent that they took over many of the educational tasks traditionally handled by parents.Lawrence Cremin, American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783 (Harper & Row, 1970)Maris A. Vinovskis, \\"Family and Schooling in Colonial and Nineteenth-Century America,\\" Journal of Family History, Jan 1987, Vol. 12 Issue 1-3, pp 19–37 First Boston Latin School House All the New England colonies required towns to set up schools, and many did so. In 1642 the Massachusetts Bay Colony made \\"proper\\" education compulsory; other New England colonies followed this example. Similar statutes were adopted in other colonies in the 1640s and 1650s. In the 18th century, \\"common schools\\" were established; students of all ages were under the control of one teacher in one room. Although they were publicly supplied at the local (town) level, they were not free. Students' families were charged tuition or \\"rate bills.\\" The larger towns in New England opened grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school.Walter H. Small, \\"The New England Grammar School, 1635–1700,\\" School Review 7 (September 1902): 513–31 The most famous was the Boston Latin School, which is still in operation as a public high school. Hopkins School in New Haven, Connecticut, was another. By the 1780s, most had been replaced by private academies. By the early 19th century New England operated a network of private high schools, now called \\"prep schools,\\" typified by Phillips Andover Academy (1778), Phillips Exeter Academy (1781), and Deerfield Academy (1797). They became the major feeders for Ivy League colleges in the mid-19th century.Ronald Story, \\"Harvard Students, The Boston Elite, And The New England Preparatory System, 1800–1870,\\" History of Education Quarterly, Fall 1975, Vol. 15 Issue 3, pp 281–298 These prep schools became coeducational in the 1970s, and remain highly prestigious in the 21st century.James McLachlan, American Boarding Schools: A Historical Study (1970)Arthur Powell, Lessons from Privilege: The American Prep School Tradition (Harvard UP, 1998)( ===The South=== Residents of the Upper South, centered on the Chesapeake Bay, created some basic schools early in the colonial period. In late 17th century Maryland, the Catholic Jesuits operated some schools for Catholic students. Generally the planter class hired tutors for the education of their children or sent them to private schools. During the colonial years, some sent their sons to England or Scotland for schooling. In March 1620, George Thorpe sailed from Bristol for Virginia. He became a deputy in charge of of land to be set aside for a university and Indian school. The plans for the school for Native Americans ended when George Thorpe was killed in the Indian Massacre of 1622. In Virginia, rudimentary schooling for the poor and paupers was provided by the local parish. Most elite parents either home schooled their children using peripatetic tutors or sent them to small local private schools. In the deep south (Georgia and South Carolina), schooling was carried out primarily by private venture teachers and a hodgepodge of publicly funded projects. In the colony of Georgia, at least ten grammar schools were in operation by 1770, many taught by ministers. The Bethesda Orphan House educated children. Dozens of private tutors and teachers advertised their service in newspapers. A study of women's signatures indicates a high degree of literacy in areas with schools. In South Carolina, scores of school projects were advertised in the South Carolina Gazette beginning in 1732. Although it is difficult to know how many ads yielded successful schools, many of the ventures advertised repeatedly over years, suggesting continuity. After the American Revolution, Georgia and South Carolina tried to start small public universities. Wealthy families sent their sons North to college. In Georgia public county academies for white students became more common, and after 1811 South Carolina opened a few free \\"common schools\\" to teach reading, writing and arithmetic. Republican governments during the Reconstruction era established the first public school systems to be supported by general taxes. Both whites and blacks would be admitted, but legislators agreed on racially segregated schools. (The few integrated schools were located in New Orleans). Particularly after white Democrats regained control of the state legislatures in former Confederate states, they consistently underfunded public schools for blacks which continued until 1954 when the United States Supreme Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. Generally public schooling in rural areas did not extend beyond the elementary grades for either whites or blacks. This was known as \\"eighth grade school\\"https://www.bankstreet.edu/school- children/admissions/progressive-education/volume-i/the-fall-and-rise-of- the-8th-grade-school/ After 1900, some cities began to establish high schools, primarily for middle class whites. In the 1930s roughly one fourth of the US population still lived and worked on farms and few rural Southerners of either race went beyond the 8th grade until after 1945.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/20/us/farm-population-lowest- since-1850-s.htmlJohn Hardin Best, \\"Education in the Forming of the American South,\\" History of Education Quarterly 36#1 (1996), pp. 39–51 in JSTORCharles Dabney, Universal Education in the South (2 vols. 1939) ===Women and girls=== The earliest continually operating school for girls in the United States is the Catholic Ursuline Academy in New Orleans. It was founded in 1727 by the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula. The Academy graduated the first female pharmacist. The first convent established in the United States supported the Academy. This was the first free school and first retreat center for young women. It was the first school to teach free women of color, Native Americans, and female African-American slaves. In the region, Ursuline provided the first center of social welfare in the Mississippi Valley; and it was the first boarding school for girls in Louisiana, and the first school of music in New Orleans.Clark, Robenstine. \\"French Colonial Policy and the Education of Women and Minorities: Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth Century,\\" History of Education Quarterly (1992) 32#2 pp. 193–211 in JSTOR Tax-supported schooling for girls began as early as 1767 in New England. It was optional and some towns proved reluctant to support this innovation. Northampton, Massachusetts, for example, was a late adopter because it had many rich families who dominated the political and social structures. They did not want to pay taxes to aid poor families. Northampton assessed taxes on all households, rather than only on those with children, and used the funds to support a grammar school to prepare boys for college. Not until after 1800 did Northampton educate girls with public money. In contrast, the town of Sutton, Massachusetts, was diverse in terms of social leadership and religion at an early point in its history. Sutton paid for its schools by means of taxes on households with children only, thereby creating an active constituency in favor of universal education for both boys and girls.Kathryn Kish Sklar, \\"The Schooling of Girls and Changing Community Values in Massachusetts Towns, 1750–1820,\\" History of Education Quarterly 1993 33(4): 511–542 Colonial schoolhouse in Hollis, New Hampshire Historians note that reading and writing were different skills in the colonial era. Schools taught both, but in places without schools, writing was taught mainly to boys and a few privileged girls. Men handled worldly affairs and needed to both read and write. It was believed that girls needed only to read (especially religious materials). This educational disparity between reading and writing explains why the colonial women often could read, but could not write and could not sign their names—they used an \\"X\\".E. Jennifer Monaghan, \\"Literacy Instruction and Gender in Colonial New England,\\" American Quarterly 1988 40(1): 18–41 in JSTOR The education of elite women in Philadelphia after 1740 followed the British model developed by the gentry classes during the early 18th century. Rather than emphasizing ornamental aspects of women's roles, this new model encouraged women to engage in more substantive education, reaching into the classical arts and sciences to improve their reasoning skills. Education had the capacity to help colonial women secure their elite status by giving them traits that their 'inferiors' could not easily mimic. Fatherly (2004) examines British and American writings that influenced Philadelphia during the 1740s–1770s and the ways in which Philadelphia women gained education and demonstrated their status.Sarah E. Fatherly, \\"Women's Education in Colonial Philadelphia,\\" Pennsylvania Magazine Of History and Biography 2004 128(3): 229–256 ===Non-English schools=== By 1664, when the territory was taken over by the English, most towns in the New Netherland colony had already set up elementary schools. The schools were closely related to the Dutch Reformed Church, and emphasized reading for religious instruction and prayer. The English closed the Dutch-language public schools; in some cases these were converted into private academies. The new English government showed little interest in public schools. German settlements from New York through Pennsylvania, Maryland and down to the Carolinas sponsored elementary schools closely tied to their churches, with each denomination or sect sponsoring its own schools. In the early colonial years, German immigrants were Protestant and the drive for education was related to teaching students to read Scripture. Following waves of German Catholic immigration after the 1848 revolutions, and after the end of the Civil War, both Catholics and Missouri Synod Lutherans began to set up their own German-language parochial schools, especially in cities of heavy German immigration: such as Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago and Milwaukee, as well as rural areas heavily settled by Germans. The Amish, a small religious sect speaking German, are opposed to schooling past the elementary level. They see it as unnecessary, as dangerous to preservation of their faith, and as beyond the purview of government.https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/social- organization/education/ The Supreme Court supported them in the Wisconsin v. Yoder decision in 1972.Gage Raley, \\"'Yoder' Revisited: Why The Landmark Amish Schooling Case Could—And Should—Be Overturned\\" Virginia Law Review 97#3 (2011), pp. 681-722 in JSTOR Spain had small settlements in Florida, the Southwest, and also controlled Louisiana. There is little evidence that they schooled any girls. Parish schools were administered by Jesuits or Franciscans and were limited to male students. Excerpt from The New England Primer of 1690, the most popular American textbook of the 18th century ===Textbooks=== In the 17th century, colonists imported schoolbooks from England. By 1690, Boston publishers were reprinting the English Protestant Tutor under the title of The New England Primer. The Primer was built on rote memorization. By simplifying Calvinist theology, the Primer enabled the Puritan child to define the limits of the self by relating his life to the authority of God and his parents. The Primer included additional material that made it widely popular in colonial schools until it was supplanted by Webster's work. The \\"blue backed speller\\" of Noah Webster was by far the most common textbook from the 1790s until 1836, when the McGuffey Readers appeared. Both series emphasized civic duty and morality, and sold tens of millions of copies nationwide. Webster's Speller was the pedagogical blueprint for American textbooks; it was so arranged that it could be easily taught to students, and it progressed by age. Webster believed students learned most readily when complex problems were broken into its component parts. Each pupil could master one part before moving to the next. Ellis argues that Webster anticipated some of the insights associated in the 20th century with Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Webster said that children pass through distinctive learning phases in which they master increasingly complex or abstract tasks. He stressed that teachers should not try to teach a three-year-old how to read—wait until they are ready at age five. He planned the Speller accordingly, starting with the alphabet, then covering the different sounds of vowels and consonants, then syllables; simple words came next, followed by more complex words, then sentences. Webster's Speller was entirely secular. It ended with two pages of important dates in American history, beginning with Columbus' \\"discovery\\" in 1492 and ending with the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, by which the United States achieved independence. There was no mention of God, the Bible, or sacred events. As Ellis explains, \\"Webster began to construct a secular catechism to the nation-state. Here was the first appearance of 'civics' in American schoolbooks. In this sense, Webster's speller was the secular successor to The New England Primer with its explicitly biblical injunctions.\\" Bynack (1984) examines Webster in relation to his commitment to the idea of a unified American national culture that would prevent the decline of republican virtues and national solidarity. Webster acquired his perspective on language from such German theorists as Johann David Michaelis and Johann Gottfried Herder. He believed with them that a nation's linguistic forms and the thoughts correlated with them shaped individuals' behavior. He intended the etymological clarification and reform of American English to improve citizens' manners and thereby preserve republican purity and social stability. Webster animated his Speller and Grammar by following these principles. ===Colonial colleges=== Higher education was largely oriented toward training men as ministers before 1800. Doctors and lawyers were trained in local apprentice systems. Religious denominations established most early colleges in order to train ministers. New England had a long emphasis on literacy in order that individuals could read the Bible. Harvard College was founded by the colonial legislature in 1636, and named after an early benefactor. Most of the funding came from the colony, but the college began to build an endowment from its early years. Harvard at first focused on training young men for the ministry, but many alumni went into law, medicine, government or business. The college was a leader in bringing Newtonian science to the colonies.Frederick E. Brasch, \\"The Newtonian Epoch in the American Colonies.\\" Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society Vol. 49. (1939). The College of William & Mary was founded by Virginia government in 1693, with of land for an endowment, and a penny tax on every pound of tobacco, together with an annual appropriation. It was closely associated with the established Anglican Church. James Blair, the leading Anglican minister in the colony, was president for 50 years. The college won the broad support of the Virginia planter class, most of whom were Anglicans. It hired the first law professor and trained many of the lawyers, politicians, and leading planters.Craig Evan Klafter, \\"St. George Tucker: The First Modern American Law Professor.\\" Journal of The Historical Society 6.1 (2006): 133-150. Students headed for the ministry were given free tuition. The first history of Yale was written by President Thomas Clap in 1766. Yale College was founded by Puritans in 1701, and in 1716 was relocated to New Haven, Connecticut. The conservative Puritan ministers of Connecticut had grown dissatisfied with the more liberal theology of Harvard, and wanted their own school to train orthodox ministers. However president Thomas Clap (1740–1766) strengthened the curriculum in the natural sciences and made Yale a stronghold of revivalist New Light theology.Louis Leonard Tucker, Puritan Protagonist President Thomas Clap of Yale College (1962). New Side Presbyterians in 1747 set up the College of New Jersey, in the town of Princeton; much later it was renamed as Princeton University. Baptists established Rhode Island College in 1764, and in 1804 it was renamed Brown University in honor of a benefactor. Brown was especially liberal in welcoming young men from other denominations. In New York City, the Anglicans set up Kings College in 1746, with its president Samuel Johnson the only teacher. It closed during the American Revolution, and reopened in 1784 as an independent institution under the name of Columbia College; it is now Columbia University. The Academy of Philadelphia was created in 1749 by Benjamin Franklin and other civic minded leaders in Philadelphia. Unlike colleges in other cities, it was not oriented toward the training of ministers. It founded the first medical school in America in 1765, therefore becoming America's first university. The Pennsylvania state legislature conferred a new corporate charter upon the College of Philadelphia and renamed it the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. The Dutch Reformed Church in 1766 set up Queens College in New Jersey, which later became known as Rutgers University and gained state support. Dartmouth College, chartered in 1769 as a school for Native Americans, relocated to its present site in Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1770.John R. Thelin, A History of American Higher Education (2004) pp 1–40Lawrence A. Cremin, American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607–1783 (1970) All of the schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum oriented on the classical liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions, little homework and no lab sessions. The college president typically tried to enforce strict discipline. The upperclassmen enjoyed hazing the freshmen. Many students were younger than 17, and most of the colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but many of the schools had active literary societies. Tuition was very low and scholarships were few.Frederick Rudolph, The American College and University: A History (1991) pp 3–22 The colonies had no schools of law. A few young American students studied at the prestigious Inns of Court in London. The majority of aspiring lawyers served apprenticeships with established American lawyers, or \\"read the law\\" to qualify for bar exams.Anton-Hermann Chroust, Rise of the Legal Profession in America (1965) vol 1 ch 1–2 Law became very well established in the colonies, compared to medicine, which was in rudimentary condition. In the 18th century, 117 Americans had graduated in medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, but most physicians learned as apprentices in the colonies.Genevieve Miller, \\"A Physician in 1776,\\" Clio Medica, Oct 1976, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 135–146 The trustees of the Academy of Philadelphia, later the University of Pennsylvania, established the first medical school in the colonies in 1765, becoming the first university in the colonies. In New York, the medical department of King's College was established in 1767, and in 1770 it awarded the first American M.D. degree.Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed. Encyclopedia of the North American colonies (3 vol 1992) 1:214 ==Federal era== After the Revolution, northern states especially emphasized education and rapidly established public schools. By the year 1870, all states had tax-subsidized elementary schools.Paul Monroe, A Cyclopedia of Education (4 vol. 1911) covers each state The US population had one of the highest literacy rates in the world at the time.\\"High literacy rates in America ... exceeded 90 per cent in some regions by 1800.\\" Hannah Barker and Simon Burrows, eds. Press, Politics and the Public Sphere in Europe and North America 1760–1820 (2002) p. 141; for lower rates in Europe see p. 9. Private academies also flourished in the towns across the country, but rural areas (where most people lived) had few schools before the 1880s. In 1821, Boston started the first public high school in the United States. By the close of the 19th century, public secondary schools began to outnumber private ones.Jurgen Herbst, The Once and Future School: Three Hundred and Fifty Years of American Secondary Education (1996) Over the years, Americans have been influenced by a number of European reformers; among them Pestalozzi, Herbart, and Montessori. ===Republican motherhood=== By the early 19th century with the rise of the new United States, a new mood was alive in urban areas. Especially influential were the writings of Lydia Maria Child, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, and Lydia Sigourney, who developed the role of republican motherhood as a principle that united state and family by equating a successful republic with virtuous families. Women, as intimate and concerned observers of young children, were best suited to the role of guiding and teaching children. By the 1840s, New England writers such as Child, Sedgwick, and Sigourney became respected models and advocates for improving and expanding education for females. Greater educational access meant formerly male-only subjects, such as mathematics and philosophy, were to be integral to curricula at public and private schools for girls. By the late 19th century, these institutions were extending and reinforcing the tradition of women as educators and supervisors of American moral and ethical values.Sarah Robbins, \\"'The Future Good and Great of our Land': Republican Mothers, Female Authors, and Domesticated Literacy in Antebellum New England,\\" New England Quarterly 2002 75(4): 562–591 in JSTOR The ideal of Republican motherhood pervaded the entire nation, greatly enhancing the status of women and supporting girls' need for education. The relative emphasis on decorative arts and refinement of female instruction which had characterized the colonial era was replaced after 1776 by a program to support women in education for their major role in nation building, in order that they become good republican mothers of good republican youth. Fostered by community spirit and financial donations, private female academies were established in towns across the South as well as the North. Rich planters were particularly insistent on having their daughters schooled, since education often served as a substitute for dowry in marriage arrangements. The academies usually provided a rigorous and broad curriculum that stressed writing, penmanship, arithmetic, and languages, especially French. By 1840, the female academies succeeded in producing a cultivated, well-read female elite ready for their roles as wives and mothers in southern aristocratic society.Catherine Clinton, \\"Equally Their Due: The Education of the Planter Daughter in the Early Republic,\\" Journal of the Early Republic 1982 2(1): 39–60 ===Attendance=== The 1840 census indicated that about 55% of the 3.68 million school age children between the ages of five and fifteen attended primary schools or academies. Many families could not afford to pay for their children to go to school or to spare them from farm work.1840 Census Data. Progress of the United States in Population and Wealth in Fifty Years, accessed May 10, 2008. Beginning in the late 1830s, more private academies were established for girls for education past primary school, especially in northern states. Some offered classical education similar to that offered to boys. Data from the indentured servant contracts of German immigrant children in Pennsylvania from 1771–1817 show that the number of children receiving education increased from 33.3% in 1771–1773 to 69% in 1787–1804. Additionally, the same data showed that the ratio of school education versus home education rose from .25 in 1771–1773 to 1.68 in 1787–1804.Farley Grubb, \\"Educational Choice in the Era Before Free Public Schooling: Evidence from German Immigrant Children in Pennsylvania, 1771–1817\\" The Journal of Economic History, 52#2 (1992), pp. 363–375. While some African Americans managed to achieve literacy, southern states largely prohibited schooling to blacks. Teachers, early 1800s Teaching young students was not an attractive career for educated people.Fonals Parkerson, Donald H. and JoAnn Parkerson, Transitions in American Education: A Social History of Teaching. (Routledge, 2001) ch 1. Adults became teachers without any particular skill. Hiring was handled by the local school board, who were mainly interested in the efficient use of limited taxes and favored young single women from local taxpaying families. This started to change with the introduction of two-year normal schools starting in 1823. Normal schools increasingly provided career paths for unmarried middle- class women. By 1900 most teachers of elementary schools in the northern states had been trained at normal schools. One-room schoolhouses Given the high proportion of population in rural areas, with limited numbers of students, most communities relied on one-room school houses. Teachers would deal with the range of students of various ages and abilities by using the Monitorial System, an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. This method was also known as \\"mutual instruction\\" or the \\"Bell-Lancaster method\\" after the British educators Dr Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster, who each independently developed it about 1798. As older children in families would teach younger ones, the abler pupils in these schools became 'helpers' to the teacher, and taught other students what they had learned. Mann reforms Upon becoming the secretary of education of Massachusetts in 1837, Horace Mann (1796–1859) worked to create a statewide system of professional teachers, based on the Prussian model of \\"common schools.\\" Prussia was attempting to develop a system of education by which all students were entitled to the same content in their public classes. Mann initially focused on elementary education and on training teachers. The common-school movement quickly gained strength across the North. Connecticut adopted a similar system in 1849, and Massachusetts passed a compulsory attendance law in 1852. Mann's crusading style attracted wide middle-class support. Historian Ellwood P. Cubberley asserts: > No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the > conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that > its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather > than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends. An important technique which Mann had learned in Prussia and introduced in Massachusetts in 1848 was to place students in grades by age. They were assigned by age to different grades and progressed through them, regardless of differences of aptitude. In addition, he used the lecture method common in European universities, which required students to receive instruction rather than take an active role in instructing one another. Previously, schools had often had groups of students who ranged in age from 6 to 14 years. With the introduction of age grading, multi-aged classrooms all but disappeared.See in Some students progressed with their grade and completed all courses the secondary school had to offer. These were \\"graduated,\\" and were awarded a certificate of completion. This was increasingly done at a ceremony imitating college graduation rituals. Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn the nation's unruly children into disciplined, judicious republican citizens, Mann won widespread approval for building public schools from modernizers, especially among fellow Whigs. Most states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \\"normal schools\\" to train professional teachers. This quickly developed into a widespread form of school which later became known as the factory model school. Free schooling was available through some of the elementary grades. Graduates of these schools could read and write, though not always with great precision. Mary Chesnut, a Southern diarist, mocks the North's system of free education in her journal entry of June 3, 1862, where she derides misspelled words from the captured letters of Union soldiers. Compulsory laws Geyer, Ohio By 1900, 34 states had compulsory schooling laws; four were in the South. Thirty states with compulsory schooling laws required attendance until age 14 (or higher). As a result, by 1910, 72 percent of American children attended school. Half the nation's children attended one-room schools. By 1918, every state required students to complete elementary school.Graham, P.A. 1974). Community and Class in American Education, 1865–1918. New York: Wiley. Religion and schools As the majority of the nation was Protestant in the 19th century, most states passed a constitutional amendment, called Blaine Amendments, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools. This was largely directed against Catholics, as the heavy immigration from Catholic Ireland after the 1840s aroused nativist sentiment. There were longstanding tensions between Catholic and Protestant believers, long associated with nation states that had established religions. Many Protestants believed that Catholic children should be educated in public schools in order to become American. By 1890 the Irish, who as the first major Catholic immigrant group controlled the Church hierarchy in the U.S., had built an extensive network of parishes and parish schools (\\"parochial schools\\") across the urban Northeast and Midwest. The Irish and other Catholic ethnic groups intended parochial schools not only to protect their religion, but to enhance their culture and language.Timothy Walch, Parish School: American Catholic Parochial Education From Colonial Times to the Present (2003)James J. Hennesey, American Catholics: A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United States (1983) p 172 Catholics and German Lutherans, as well as Dutch Protestants, organized and funded their own elementary schools. Catholic communities also raised money to build colleges and seminaries to train teachers and religious leaders to head their churches.Walch, Parish School (2003)Dennis Clark, The Irish in Philadelphia: Ten Generations of Urban Experience, (1984), pp. 96–101 In the 19th century, most Catholics were Irish or German immigrants and their children; in the 1890s new waves of Catholic immigrants began arriving from Italy and Poland. The parochial schools met some opposition, as in the Bennett Law in Wisconsin in 1890, but they thrived and grew. Catholic nuns served as teachers in most schools and were paid low salaries in keeping with their vows of poverty.Carol Coburn and Martha Smith Spirited Lives: How Nuns Shaped Catholic Culture and American Life, 1836–1920 (1999) p 144 In 1925 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Pierce v. Society of Sisters that students could attend private schools to comply with state compulsory education laws, thus giving parochial schools an official blessing.Hennesey, American Catholics pp 247–48 Schools for Black students In the early days of the Reconstruction era, the Freedmen's Bureau opened 1000 schools across the South for black children. This was essentially building on schools that had been established in numerous large contraband camps. Freedmen were eager for schooling for both adults and children, and the enrollments were high and enthusiastic. Overall, the Bureau spent $5 million to set up schools for blacks. By the end of 1865, more than 90,000 freedmen were enrolled as students in these schools. The school curriculum resembled that of schools in the North. Many Bureau teachers were well-educated Yankee women motivated by religion and abolitionism. Half the teachers were southern whites; one-third were blacks, and one-sixth were northern whites. Most were women but among African Americans, male teachers slightly outnumbered female teachers. In the South, people were attracted to teaching because of the good salaries, at a time when the societies were disrupted and the economy was poor. Northern teachers were typically funded by northern organizations and were motivated by humanitarian goals to help the freedmen. As a group, only the black cohort showed a commitment to racial equality; they were also the ones most likely to continue as teachers. When the Republicans came to power in the Southern states after 1867, they created the first system of taxpayer-funded public schools. Southern Blacks wanted public schools for their children but they did not demand racially integrated schools. Almost all the new public schools were segregated, apart from a few in New Orleans. After the Republicans lost power in the mid-1870s, conservative whites retained the public school systems but sharply cut their funding. Almost all private academies and colleges in the South were strictly segregated by race.Berea College in Kentucky was the main exception until state law in 1904 forced its segregation. Richard Allen Heckman and Betty Jean Hall. \\"Berea College and the Day Law.\\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 66.1 (1968): 35–52. in JSTOR The American Missionary Association supported the development and establishment of several historically black colleges, such as Fisk University and Shaw University. In this period, a handful of northern colleges accepted black students. Northern denominations and their missionary associations especially established private schools across the South to provide secondary education. They provided a small amount of collegiate work. Tuition was minimal, so churches supported the colleges financially, and also subsidized the pay of some teachers. In 1900, churches—mostly based in the North—operated 247 schools for blacks across the South, with a budget of about $1 million. They employed 1600 teachers and taught 46,000 students.Joe M. Richardson, Christian Reconstruction: The American Missionary Association and Southern Blacks, 1861–1890 (1986). Prominent schools included Howard University, a federal institution based in Washington; Fisk University in Nashville, Atlanta University, Hampton Institute in Virginia, and many others. Most new colleges in the 19th century were founded in northern states. In 1890, Congress expanded the land-grant program to include federal support for state-sponsored colleges across the South. It required states to identify colleges for black students as well as white ones in order to get land grant support. Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute was of national importance because it set the standards for what was called industrial education. Of even greater influence was Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers, led from 1881 by Hampton alumnus Booker T. Washington. In 1900 few black students were enrolled in college-level work; their schools had very weak faculties and facilities. The alumni of Keithley became high school teachers. While the colleges and academies were generally coeducational, until the late 20th century, historians had taken little notice of the role of women as students and teachers.Marybeth Gasman, \\"Swept under the rug? A historiography of gender and Black colleges,\\" American Educational Research Journal 44#4 (2007): 760–805. online  Native American Missionary Schools  As religious revivalism swept through the United States in the early 1800s, a growing group of evangelical Christians took on the role of missionaries. These missionaries were, in many cases, concerned with converting non-Christians to Christianity. Native Americans were a nearby and easy target for these missionaries. According to the scholars Theda Perdue and Michael D. Green, these Christian missionaries believed that the Native Americans were uncivilized, and were in need of help from the missionaries to make them more civilized and more like Anglo-Americans. Missionaries found great difficulty converting adults, but, according to Perdue and Green's research, they found it much easier to convert Native American children. To do so, missionaries often separated Native American children from their families to live at boarding schools where the missionaries believed they could civilize and convert them. Missionary schools in the American Southeast were first developed in 1817. Perdue and Green's research has shown that these children did not only learn the basic subjects of education that most American children experienced, but also were taught to live and act like Anglo- Americans. Boys learned to farm, and girls were taught domestic labor, and according to Perdue and Green, they were taught that Anglo-American civilization was superior to the traditional Native American cultures that these children came from. David Brown, a Cherokee man who converted to Christianity and promoted the conversion to Christianity of Native Americans, went on a fundraising speaking tour to raise money for missionary societies and their boarding schools. Brown, in his speech, described the progress that he believed had been made in civilizing Native American children in missionary schools. \\"The Indians,\\" he claimed, \\"are making rapid advances toward the standard of morality, virtue and religions.\\" The responsibility for missionary work fell on the missionaries themselves for the most part. While the U.S. government provided some funding for missionary work, such as Native American Missionary Schools, the missionaries themselves were primarily responsible for running these schools. The scholar Kyle Massey Stephens argues that the federal government acted in a supporting role in assimilation programs like these mission schools. President James Monroe, though, wanted the United States to increase funding and assistance with private mission schools in their efforts to educate Native American children. According the Stephen's work, the first missionary schools from 1817 were funded completely by private donors. In 1819, this changed when Congress appropriated an annual fee of $10,000 to be given to missionary societies in addition to their private fundraising. The United States Secretary of War at the time, John C. Calhoun, advocated for these funds to be used towards educating Native American children in Anglo-American culture with courses on farming and mechanics for boys, and domestic labor for girls. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which was founded in 1824 to handle issues related to Native Americans, had thirty-two missionary schools that they had sanctioned in Native American communities in its first year of existence. In these schools, 916 Native American children were enrolled. Influence of colleges in 19th century Summarizing the research of Burke and Hall, Katz concludes that in the 19th century:Michael Katz, \\"The Role of American Colleges in the Nineteenth Century,\\" History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 23, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 215–223 in JSTOR, summarizing Colin B. Burke, American Collegiate Populations: A Test of the Traditional View (New York University Press, 1982) and Peter Dobkin Hall, The Organization of American Culture: Private Institutions, Elites, and the Origins of American Nationality (New York University Press, 1982) # The nation's many small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. # These colleges especially promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers, and thereby provided towns across the country with a core of community leaders. # The more elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed relatively little to upward social mobility. By concentrating on the offspring of wealthy families, ministers and a few others, the elite Eastern colleges, especially Harvard, played an important role in the formation of a Northeastern elite with great power. ==20th centuryProgressive Era=== The progressive era in education was part of a larger Progressive Movement, extending from the 1890s to the 1930s. The era was notable for a dramatic expansion in the number of schools and students served, especially in the fast-growing metropolitan cities. After 1910, smaller cities also began building high schools. By 1940, 50% of young adults had earned a high school diploma. Radical historians in the 1960s, steeped in the anti-bureaucratic ethos of the New Left, deplored the emergence of bureaucratic school systems. They argued its purpose was to suppress the upward aspirations of the working class.Diane Ravitch, The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools (1978) pp 32–41 But other historians have emphasized the necessity of building non-politicized standardized systems. The reforms in St. Louis, according to historian Selwyn Troen, were, \\"born of necessity as educators first confronted the problems of managing a rapidly expanding and increasingly complex institutions.\\" Troen found that the bureaucratic solution removed schools from the bitterness and spite of ward politics. Troen argues: > In the space of only a generation, public education had left behind a highly > regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the > basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban > citizens, and had replaced it with a largely apolitical, more highly > organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students > the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In > terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, > a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare > of urban youth.Selwyn K. Troen, The Public and the Schools: Shaping the St. > Louis System 1838–1920 (1975) pp 151, 224–26, quoted in Ravitch, The > Revisionists Revised, pp 55–56 The social elite in many cities in the 1890s led the reform movement. Their goal was to permanently end political party control of the local schools for the benefit of patronage jobs and construction contracts, which had arisen out of ward politics that absorbed and taught the millions of new immigrants. New York City elite led progressive reforms. Reformers installed a bureaucratic system run by experts, and demanded expertise from prospective teachers. The reforms opened the way for hiring more Irish Catholic and Jewish teachers, who proved adept at handling the civil service tests and gaining the necessary academic credentials. Before the reforms, schools had often been used as a means to provide patronage jobs for party foot soldiers. The new emphasis concentrated on broadening opportunities for the students. New programs were established for the physically handicapped; evening recreation centers were set up; vocational schools were opened; medical inspections became routine; programs began to teach English as a second language; and school libraries were opened. Dewey and progressive education The leading educational theorist of the era was John Dewey (1859–1952), a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago (1894–1904) and at Teachers College (1904 to 1930), of Columbia University in New York City.Paul Peterson, Saving Schools: From Horace Mann to Virtual Learning (2010) pp 37–50 Dewey was a leading proponent of \\"Progressive Education\\" and wrote many books and articles to promote the central role of democracy in education.William J. Reese, \\"The Origins of Progressive Education,\\" History of Education Quarterly 2001 41(1): 1–24. He believed that schools were not only a place for students to gain content knowledge, but also as a place for them to learn how to live. The purpose of education was thus to realize the student's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. Dewey noted that, \\"to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities.\\" Dewey insisted that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He noted that \\"education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction.\\".John Dewey, My Pedagogic Creed (1897) PP. 6, 16 Although Dewey's ideas were very widely discussed, they were implemented chiefly in small experimental schools attached to colleges of education. In the public schools, Dewey and the other progressive theorists encountered a highly bureaucratic system of school administration that was typically not receptive to new methods.Diane Ravitch, Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms (2000), p. 169; David Tyack, The One Best System: A History of American Urban Education (1974) pp. 197–98. Dewey viewed public schools and their narrow-mindedness with disdain and as undemocratic and close minded. Meanwhile, laboratory schools, such as the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, were much more open to original thought and experimentation. Not only was Dewey involved with laboratory schools, but he was also deeply involved with the emerging philosophy of pragmatism, which he incorporated within his laboratory schools. Dewey viewed pragmatism critical for the growth of democracy, which Dewey did not view as just a form of government, but something that occurred within the workings of the laboratory schools as well as everyday life. Dewey utilized the laboratory schools as an experimental platform for his theories on pragmatism, democracy, as well as how humans learned. Black education Booker T. Washington was the dominant black political and educational leader in the United States from the 1890s until his death in 1915. Washington not only led his own college, Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, but his advice, political support, and financial connections proved important to many other black colleges and high schools, which were primarily located in the South. This was the center of the black population until after the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century. Washington was a respected advisor to major philanthropies, such as the Rockefeller, Rosenwald and Jeanes foundations, which provided funding for leading black schools and colleges. The Rosenwald Foundation provided matching funds for the construction of schools for rural black students in the South. Washington explained, \\"We need not only the industrial school, but the college and professional school as well, for a people so largely segregated, as we are. ... Our teachers, ministers, lawyers and doctors will prosper just in proportion as they have about them an intelligent and skillful producing class.\\" Washington was a strong advocate of progressive reforms as advocated by Dewey, emphasizing scientific, industrial and agricultural education that produced a base for lifelong learning, and enabled careers for many black teachers, professionals, and upwardly mobile workers. He tried to adapt to the system and did not support political protests against the segregated Jim Crow system. At the same time, Washington used his network to provide important funding to support numerous legal challenges by the NAACP against the systems of disenfranchisement which southern legislatures had passed at the turn of the century, effectively excluding blacks from politics for decades into the 1960s. Atlanta In most American cities, Progressives in the Efficiency Movement looked for ways to eliminate waste and corruption. They emphasized using experts in schools. For example, in the 1897 reform of the Atlanta schools, the school board was reduced in size, eliminating the power of ward bosses. The members of the school board were elected at-large, reducing the influence of various interest groups. The power of the superintendent was increased. Centralized purchasing allowed for economies of scale, although it also added opportunities for censorship and suppression of dissent. Standards of hiring and tenure in teachers were made uniform. Architects designed school buildings in which the classrooms, offices, workshops and other facilities related together. Curricular innovations were introduced. The reforms were designed to produce a school system for white students according to the best practices of the day. Middle-class professionals instituted these reforms; they were equally antagonistic to the traditional business elites and to working-class elements. Gary plan The \\"Gary plan\\" was implemented in the new industrial \\"steel\\" city of Gary, Indiana, by William Wirt, the superintendent who served from 1907–30. Although the U.S. Steel Corporation dominated the Gary economy and paid abundant taxes, it did not shape Wirt's educational reforms. The Gary Plan emphasized highly efficient use of buildings and other facilities. This model was adopted by more than 200 cities around the country, including New York City. Wirt divided students into two platoons—one platoon used the academic classrooms, while the second platoon was divided among the shops, nature studies, auditorium, gymnasium, and outdoor facilities. Then the platoons rotated position. Wirt set up an elaborate night school program, especially to Americanize new immigrants. The introduction of vocational educational programs, such as wood shop, machine shop, typing, and secretarial skills proved especially popular with parents who wanted their children to become foremen and office workers. By the Great Depression, most cities found the Gary plan too expensive, and abandoned it. ===Great Depression and New Deal: 1929-39 === Public schools across the country were badly hurt by the Great Depression, as tax revenues fell in local and state governments shifted funding to relief projects. Budgets were slashed, and teachers went unpaid. During the New Deal, 1933–39, President Franklin Roosevelt and his advisers were hostile to the elitism shown by the educational establishment. They refused all pleas for direct federal help to public or private schools or universities. They rejected proposals for federal funding for research at universities. But they did help poor students, and the major New Deal relief programs built many schools buildings as requested by local governments. The New Deal approach to education was a radical departure from educational best practices. It was specifically designed for the poor and staffed largely by women on relief. It was not based on professionalism, nor was it designed by experts. Instead it was premised on the anti-elitist notion that a good teacher does not need paper credentials, that learning does not need a formal classroom and that the highest priority should go to the bottom tier of society. Leaders in the public schools were shocked: They were shut out as consultants and as recipients of New Deal funding. They desperately needed cash to cover the local and state revenues that had disappeared during the depression, they were well organized, and made repeated concerted efforts in 1934, 1937, and 1939, all to no avail. The conservative Republican establishment headed collaborated with for so long was out of power and Roosevelt himself was the leader in anti-elitism. The federal government had a highly professional Office of Education; Roosevelt cut its budget and staff, and refused to consult with its leader John Ward Studebaker.David Tyack et al. Public Schools in Hard times: the Great Depression and Recent Years (1984) pp 93-107. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) programs were deliberately designed to not teach skills that would put them in competition with unemployed union members. The CCC did have its own classes. They were voluntary, took place after work, and focused on teaching basic literacy to young men who had quit school before high school. The relief programs did offer indirect help. The Civil Works Administration (CWA) and Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) focused on hiring unemployed people on relief, and putting them to work on public buildings, including public schools. It built or upgraded 40,000 schools, plus thousands of playgrounds and athletic fields. It gave jobs to 50,000 teachers to keep rural schools open and to teach adult education classes in the cities. It gave a temporary jobs to unemployed teachers in cities like Boston.Leuchtenburg, p 121-22.Tyack et al. Public Schools in Hard Times pp 105 Although the New Deal refused to give money to impoverished school districts, it did give money to impoverished high school and college students. The CWA used \\"work study\\" programs to fund students, both male and female.Kevin P. Bower, \\"'A favored child of the state': Federal Student Aid at Ohio Colleges and Universities, 1934–1943.\\" History of Education Quarterly 44.3 (2004): 364-387. The National Youth Administration (NYA), a semi-autonomous branch of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) under Aubrey Williams developed apprenticeship programs and residential camps specializing in teaching vocational skills. It was one of the first agencies to set up a \\"Division of Negro Affairs\\" and make an explicit effort to enroll black students. Williams believed that the traditional high school curricula had failed to meet the needs of the poorest youth. In opposition, the well-established National Education Association (NEA) saw NYA as a dangerous challenge to local control of education NYA expanded Work-study money to reach up to 500,000 students per month in high schools, colleges, and graduate schools. The average pay was $15 a month.Ronald Story, The New Deal and Higher Education in The New Deal and the Triumph of Liberalism ed. by Sidney M. Milkis (2002). pp 272-96.Report of the National Youth Administration, June 26, 1935 to June 30, 1938 (1938) online However, in line with the anti-elitist policy, the NYA set up its own high schools, entirely separate from the public school system or academic schools of education.Tyack et al. Public Schools in Hard Times p 104Stephen Lassonde, \\"The Real, Real Youth Problem: The New Deal and American Youth: Ideas and Ideals in a Depression Decade by Richard A. Reiman,\\" Reviews in American History 22#1 (1994) pp. 149-155 in JSTOR Despite appeals from Ickes and Eleanor Roosevelt, Howard University–the federally operated school for blacks—saw its budget cut below Hoover administration levels.Clifford L. Muse, \\"Howard University and The Federal Government During The Presidential Administrations of Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1928-1945.\\" The Journal of Negro History 76.1/4 (1991): 1-20. in JSTOR ===Secondary schools=== In 1880, American high schools were primarily considered to be preparatory academies for students who were going to attend college. But by 1910 they had been transformed into core elements of the common school system and had broader goals of preparing many students for work after high school. The explosive growth brought the number of students from 200,000 in 1890 to 1,000,000 in 1910, to almost 2,000,000 by 1920; 7% of youths aged 14 to 17 were enrolled in 1890, rising to 32% in 1920. The graduates found jobs especially in the rapidly growing white-collar sector. Cities large and small across the country raced to build new high schools. Few were built in rural areas, so ambitious parents moved close to town to enable their teenagers to attend high school. After 1910, vocational education was added, as a mechanism to train the technicians and skilled workers needed by the booming industrial sector. In the 1880s the high schools started developing as community centers. They added sports and by the 1920s were building gymnasiums that attracted large local crowds to basketball and other games, especially in small town schools that served nearby rural areas. College preparation In the 1865–1914 era, the number and character of schools changed to meet the demands of new and larger cities and of new immigrants. They had to adjust to the new spirit of reform permeating the country. High schools increased in number, adjusted their curriculum to prepare students for the growing state and private universities; education at all levels began to offer more utilitarian studies in place of an emphasis on the classics. John Dewey and other Progressives advocated changes from their base in teachers' colleges. Before 1920 most secondary education, whether private or public, emphasized college entry for a select few headed for college. Proficiency in Greek and Latin was emphasized. Abraham Flexner, under commission from the philanthropic General Education Board (GEB), wrote A Modern School (1916), calling for a de-emphasis on the classics. The classics teachers fought back in a losing effort. Prior to World War I, German was preferred as a subject for a second spoken language. Prussian and German educational systems had served as a model for many communities in the United States and its intellectual standing was highly respected. Due to Germany being an enemy of the US during the war, an anti- German attitude arose in the United States. French, the international language of diplomacy, was promoted as the preferred second language instead. French survived as the second language of choice until the 1960s, when Spanish became popular. This reflected a strong increase in the Spanish-speaking population in the United States, which has continued since the late 20th century. The growth of human capital By 1900 educators argued that the post-literacy schooling of the masses at the secondary and higher levels, would improve citizenship, develop higher-order traits, and produce the managerial and professional leadership needed for rapid economic modernization. The commitment to expanded education past age 14 set the U.S. apart from Europe for much of the 20th century. From 1910 to 1940, high schools grew in number and size, reaching out to a broader clientele. In 1910, for example, 9% of Americans had a high school diploma; in 1935, the rate was 40%. By 1940, the number had increased to 50%. This phenomenon was uniquely American; no other nation attempted such widespread coverage. The fastest growth came in states with greater wealth, more homogeneity of wealth, and less manufacturing activity than others. The high schools provided necessary skill sets for youth planning to teach school, and essential skills for those planning careers in white collar work and some high-paying blue collar jobs. Claudia Goldin argues this rapid growth was facilitated by public funding, openness, gender neutrality, local (and also state) control, separation of church and state, and an academic curriculum. The wealthiest European nations, such as Germany and Britain, had far more exclusivity in their education system; few youth attended past age 14. Apart from technical training schools, European secondary schooling was dominated by children of the wealthy and the social elites. American post-elementary schooling was designed to be consistent with national needs. It stressed general and widely applicable skills not tied to particular occupations or geographic areas, in order that students would have flexible employment options. As the economy was dynamic, the emphasis was on portable skills that could be used in a variety of occupations, industries, and regions. Public schools were funded and supervised by independent districts that depended on taxpayer support. In dramatic contrast to the centralized systems in Europe, where national agencies made the major decisions, the American districts designed their own rules and curricula. Teachers and administrators Early public school superintendents emphasized discipline and rote learning, and school principals made sure the mandate was imposed on teachers. Disruptive students were expelled. Support for the high school movement occurred at the grass-roots level of local cities and school systems. After 1916, the federal government began to provide for vocational education funding as part of support for raising readiness to work in industrial and artisan jobs. In these years, states and religious bodies generally funded teacher training colleges, often called \\"normal schools\\". Gradually they developed full four-year curriculums and developed as state colleges after 1945. Teachers organized themselves during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1917, the National Education Association (NEA) was reorganized to better mobilize and represent teachers and educational staff. The rate of increase in membership was constant under the chairmanship of James Crabtree—from 8,466 members in 1917 to 220,149 in 1931. The rival American Federation of Teachers (AFT) was based in large cities and formed alliances with the local labor unions. The NEA identified as an upper-middle-class professional organization, while the AFT identified with the working class and the union movement. ===Higher education=== At the beginning of the 20th century, fewer than 1,000 colleges with 160,000 students existed in the United States. Explosive growth in the number of colleges occurred at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, supported in part by Congress' land grant programs. Philanthropists endowed many of these institutions. For example, wealthy philanthropists established Johns Hopkins University, Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, Vanderbilt University and Duke University; John D. Rockefeller funded the University of Chicago without imposing his name on it. Land Grant universities Each state used federal funding from the Morrill Land- Grant Colleges Acts of 1862 and 1890 to set up \\"land grant colleges\\" that specialized in agriculture and engineering. The 1890 act required states that had segregation also to provide all-black land grant colleges, which were dedicated primarily to teacher training. These colleges contributed to rural development, including the establishment of a traveling school program by Tuskegee Institute in 1906. Rural conferences sponsored by Tuskegee also attempted to improve the life of rural blacks. In the late 20th century, many of the schools established in 1890 have helped train students from less- developed countries to return home with the skills and knowledge to improve agricultural production. Iowa State University was the first existing school whose state legislature officially accepted the provisions of the Morrill Act on September 11, 1862.\\"Morrill Act of 1862.\\" Morrill Act of 1862  An Iowa Legacy. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Mar. 2017. Other universities soon followed, such as Purdue University, Michigan State University, Kansas State University, Cornell University (in New York), Texas A&M; University, Pennsylvania State University, The Ohio State University, and the University of California. Few alumni became farmers, but they did play an increasingly important role in the larger food industry, especially after the federal extension system was set up in 1916 that put trained agronomists in every agricultural county. Engineering graduates played a major role in rapid technological development. The land- grant college system produced the agricultural scientists and industrial engineers who constituted the critical human resources of the managerial revolution in government and business, 1862–1917, laying the foundation of the world's pre-eminent educational infrastructure that supported the world's foremost technology-based economy. Representative was Pennsylvania State University. The Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania (later the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania and then Pennsylvania State University), chartered in 1855, was intended to uphold declining agrarian values and show farmers ways to prosper through more productive farming. Students were to build character and meet a part of their expenses by performing agricultural labor. By 1875 the compulsory labor requirement was dropped, but male students were required to have an hour a day of military training in order to meet the requirements of the Morrill Land Grant College Act. In the early years, the agricultural curriculum was not well developed, and politicians in the state capital of Harrisburg often considered the land-grant college a costly and useless experiment. The college was a center of middle-class values that served to help young people on their journey to white-collar occupations. GI Bill Rejecting liberal calls for large-scale aid to education, Congress in 1944 during World War II passed the conservative program of aid limited to veterans who had served in wartime. Daniel Brumberg and Farideh Farhi state, \\"The expansive and generous postwar education benefits of the GI Bill were due not to Roosevelt's progressive vision but to the conservative American Legion.\\"See also The GI Bill made college education possible for millions by paying tuition and living expenses. The government provided between $800 and $1,400 each year to these veterans as a subsidy to attend college, which covered 50–80% of total costs. This included foregone earnings in addition to tuition, which allowed them to have enough funds for life outside of school. The GI Bill helped create a widespread belief in the necessity of college education. It opened up higher education to ambitious young men who would otherwise have been forced to immediately enter the job market after being discharged from the military. When comparing college attendance rates between veterans and non-veterans during this period, veterans were found to be 10% more likely to go to college than non-veterans. In the early decades after the bill was passed, most campuses became largely male thanks to the GI Bill, since only 2% of wartime veterans were women. But by 2000, female veterans had grown in numbers and began passing men in rates of college and graduate school attendance. Great Society When liberals regained control of Congress in 1964, they passed numerous Great Society programs supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson to expand federal support for education. The Higher Education Act of 1965 set up federal scholarships and low-interest loans for college students, and subsidized better academic libraries, ten to twenty new graduate centers, several new technical institutes, classrooms for several hundred thousand students, and twenty-five to thirty new community colleges a year. A separate education bill enacted that same year provided similar assistance to dental and medical schools. On an even larger scale, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 began pumping federal money into local school districts. ===Segregation and integration=== Segregation laws in the United States prior to Brown v. Board of Education For much of its history, education in the United States was segregated (or even only available) based upon race. Early integrated schools such as the Noyes Academy, founded in 1835, in Canaan, New Hampshire, were generally met with fierce local opposition. For the most part, African Americans received very little to no formal education before the Civil War. Some free blacks in the North managed to become literate. In the South where slavery was legal, many states had laws prohibiting teaching enslaved African Americans to read or write. A few taught themselves, others learned from white playmates or more generous masters, but most were not able to learn to read and write. Schools for free people of color were privately run and supported, as were most of the limited schools for white children. Poor white children did not attend school. The wealthier planters hired tutors for their children and sent them to private academies and colleges at the appropriate age. During Reconstruction a coalition of freedmen and white Republicans in Southern state legislatures passed laws establishing public education. The Freedmen's Bureau was created as an agency of the military governments that managed Reconstruction. It set up schools in many areas and tried to help educate and protect freedmen during the transition after the war. With the notable exception of the desegregated public schools in New Orleans, the schools were segregated by race. By 1900 more than 30,000 black teachers had been trained and put to work in the South, and the literacy rate had climbed to more than 50%, a major achievement in little more than a generation. Many colleges were set up for blacks; some were state schools like Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, others were private ones subsidized by Northern missionary societies. Although the African-American community quickly began litigation to challenge such provisions, in the 19th century Supreme Court challenges generally were not decided in their favor. The Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) upheld the segregation of races in schools as long as each race enjoyed parity in quality of education (the \\"separate but equal\\" principle). However, few black students received equal education. They suffered for decades from inadequate funding, outmoded or dilapidated facilities, and deficient textbooks (often ones previously used in white schools). Starting in 1914 and going into the 1930s, Julius Rosenwald, a philanthropist from Chicago, established the Rosenwald Fund to provide seed money for matching local contributions and stimulating the construction of new schools for African American children, mostly in the rural South. He worked in association with Booker T. Washington and architects at Tuskegee University to have model plans created for schools and teacher housing. With the requirement that money had to be raised by both blacks and whites, and schools approved by local school boards (controlled by whites), Rosenwald stimulated construction of more than 5,000 schools built across the South. In addition to Northern philanthrops and state taxes, African Americans went to extraordinary efforts to raise money for such schools. The Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s helped publicize the inequities of segregation. In 1954, the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education unanimously declared that separate facilities were inherently unequal and unconstitutional. By the 1970s segregated districts had practically vanished in the South. Integration of schools has been a protracted process, however, with results affected by vast population migrations in many areas, and affected by suburban sprawl, the disappearance of industrial jobs, and movement of jobs out of former industrial cities of the North and Midwest and into new areas of the South. Although required by court order, integrating the first black students in the South met with intense opposition. In 1957 the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, had to be enforced by federal troops. President Dwight D. Eisenhower took control of the National Guard, after the governor tried to use them to prevent integration. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, integration continued with varying degrees of difficulty. Some states and cities tried to overcome de facto segregation, a result of housing patterns, by using forced busing. This method of integrating student populations provoked resistance in many places, including northern cities, where parents wanted children educated in neighborhood schools. Although full equality and parity in education has still to be achieved (many school districts are technically still under the integration mandates of local courts), technical equality in education had been achieved by 1970. The federal government's integration efforts began to wane in the mid-1970s, and the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations later launched several attacks against desegregation orders. As a result, school integration peaked in the 1980s and has been gradually declining ever since. ===Education after 1945=== In mid-20th century America, there was intense interest in using institutions to support the innate creativity of children. It helped reshape children's play, the design of suburban homes, schools, parks, and museums.Amy F. Ogata, Designing the Creative Child: Playthings and Places in Midcentury America (2013) Producers of children's television programming worked to spark creativity. Educational toys proliferated that were designed to teach skills or develop abilities. For schools there was a new emphasis on arts as well as science in the curriculum. School buildings no longer were monumental testimonies to urban wealth; they were redesigned with the students in mind.Amy F. Ogata, \\"Building for learning in postwar American elementary schools.\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians\\" 67.4 (2008): 562-591. online The emphasis on creativity was reversed in the 1980s, as public policy emphasized test scores, school principals were forced to downplay art, drama, music, history and anything that was not being scored on standardized tests, lest their school be labelled \\"failing\\" by the quantifiers behind the \\"No Child Left Behind Act.Deborah Meier and George Wood, eds., Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools (2004)Leo M. Casey, \\"The Will to Quantify: The\\" Bottom Line\\" in the Market Model of Education Reform.\\" Teachers College Record 115.9 (2013) Inequality The Coleman Report, by University of Chicago sociology professor James Coleman proved especially controversial in 1966. Based on massive statistical data, the 1966 report titled \\"Equality of Educational Opportunity\\" fueled debate about \\"school effects\\" that has continued since.See The report was widely seen as evidence that school funding has little effect on student final achievement. A more precise reading of the Coleman Report is that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (i.e. per pupil spending). Coleman found that, on average, black schools were funded on a nearly equal basis by the 1960s, and that black students benefited from racially mixed classrooms. The comparative quality of education among rich and poor districts is still often the subject of dispute. While middle class African-American children have made good progress; poor minorities have struggled. With school systems based on property taxes, there are wide disparities in funding between wealthy suburbs or districts, and often poor, inner-city areas or small towns. \\"De facto segregation\\" has been difficult to overcome as residential neighborhoods have remained more segregated than workplaces or public facilities. Racial segregation has not been the only factor in inequities. Residents in New Hampshire challenged property tax funding because of steep contrasts between education funds in wealthy and poorer areas. They filed lawsuits to seek a system to provide more equal funding of school systems across the state. Some scholars believe that transformation of the Pell Grant program to a loan program in the early 1980s has caused an increase in the gap between the growth rates of white, Asian-American and African-American college graduates since the 1970s. Others believe the issue is increasingly related more to class and family capacity than ethnicity. Some school systems have used economics to create a different way to identify populations in need of supplemental help. Special education In 1975 Congress passed Public Law 94-142, Education for All Handicapped Children Act. One of the most comprehensive laws in the history of education in the United States, this Act brought together several pieces of state and federal legislation, making free, appropriate education available to all eligible students with a disability. The law was amended in 1986 to extend its coverage to include younger children. In 1990 the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) extended its definitions and changed the label \\"handicap\\" to \\"disabilities\\". Further procedural changes were amended to IDEA in 1997. ===Reform efforts in the 1980s=== In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education released a report titled A Nation at Risk. Soon afterward, conservatives were calling for an increase in academic rigor including an increase in the number of school days per year, longer school days and higher testing standards. English scholar E.D. Hirsch made an influential attack on progressive education, advocating an emphasis on \\"cultural literacy\\"—the facts, phrases, and texts that Hirsch asserted are essential for decoding basic texts and maintaining communication. Hirsch's ideas remain influential in conservative circles into the 21st century. Hirsch's ideas have been controversial because as Edwards argues: > Opponents from the political left generally accuse Hirsch of elitism. Worse > yet in their minds, Hirsch's assertion might lead to a rejection of > toleration, pluralism, and relativism. On the political right, Hirsch has > been assailed as totalitarian, for his idea lends itself to turning over > curriculum selection to federal authorities and thereby eliminating the > time-honored American tradition of locally controlled schools.Dr. Jason R. > Edwards, \\"E.D. Hirsch Jr.: The Twentieth Century's Liberal Conservative > Educator,\\" The Center for Vision & Values (2009) online By 1990, the United States spent 2 percent of its budget on education, compared with 30 percent on support for the elderly. ==21st centuryPolicy since 2000=== \\"No Child Left Behind\\" was a major national law passed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress in 2002, marked a new direction. In exchange for more federal aid, the states were required to measure progress and punish schools that were not meeting the goals as measured by standardized state exams in math and language skills. By 2012, half the states were given waivers because the original goal that 100% students by 2014 be deemed \\"proficient\\" had proven unrealistic. By 2012, 45 states had dropped the requirement to teach cursive writing from the curriculum. Few schools start the school day by singing the national anthem, as was once done. Few schools have mandatory recess for children. Educators are trying to reinstate recess. Few schools have mandatory arts class. Continuing reports of a student's progress can be found online, supplementing the former method of periodic report cards. By 2015, criticisms from a broad range of political ideologies had cumulated so far that a bipartisan Congress stripped away all the national features of No Child Left Behind, turning the remnants over to the states.Lyndsey Layton, \\"Obama signs new K–12 education law that ends No Child Left Behind\\" Washington Post Dec 11, 2015 Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing and increasingly digital workplace and society. 21st century skills are a series of higher-order skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies. Many of these skills are also associated with deeper learning, including analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork, compared to traditional knowledge-based academic skills.Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009.

It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world. Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic- minded community were the heroes. The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.Sol Cohen, \\"The history of the history of American education, 1900–1976: The uses of the past.\\" Harvard Educational Review 46#3 (1976): 298–330. onlineLawrence A. Cremin, The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley (1965) The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of New Left scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939–2014) states they: > tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism > and segregation; the distribution Of power among gender and classes; > intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social > institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, > delinquency, and education. The old guard fought back in bitter historiographical contests.Diane Ravitch, The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools (1978) was a major counterattack. The younger scholars largely promoted the proposition that schools were not the solution To America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment declined sharply in education history courses and never recovered. Most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers, but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. Attention has often focused on minority, and ethnic students. The social history of teachers has also been studied in depth. Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young. The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education. It is very important to keep in mind that during the gradual progression of history, the focus of the country's changes with each elected president. Historians now ask the questions of what economics was the center of the thought process in the first besides driving capitalistic gain. A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, The Race between Education and Technology (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling. ==See also== * History of Catholic education in the United States * History of education in Missouri * Education in the United States * Education reform * Federal Involvement in US Education * Shopping mall high school ==References== ==Further reading== * Allen, Walter R., et al. \\"From Bakke to Fisher: African American Students in US Higher Education over Forty Years.\\" RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences 4.6 (2018): 41-72 online. * Altenbaugh; Richard J.

In 1954, Ivanhoe opened its first shopping centre, Dorval Gardens, in the Montreal area. During the 1950s and 1960s, the company focused on building shopping centres in the Greater Montreal area and also built projects in Ontario, especially in the Ottawa area. Ivanhoe specialized in shopping centres located in growing urban areas. In the 1980s, Ivanhoe Corporation, which had become Ivanhoe Inc.,Letters patent. Government of Québec, Department of Consumers, Co-operatives and Financial Institutions, Companies Department. November 1, 1977 was the largest real estate company in Quebec and the sixth-biggest in Canada. When the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec acquired Ivanhoe Inc. in 1990, its portfolio consisted of 36 shopping centres, located mostly in Quebec and Ontario. The value of Ivanhoe's real estate portfolio was then about C$1 billion, making it one of Canada’s largest real estate companies. Up until the 1990s, Ivanhoe's owned-and- operated portfolio basically consisted of shopping centres built by the late Sam Steinberg. Ivanhoe made its first major acquisitions with in 1994, and Place Montréal Trust in 1995. In 2000, Ivanhoe’s portfolio grew to include Centre Eaton de Montréal, a prestigious shopping centre located along the city’s main commercial artery, and Place Laurier, one of Quebec's largest shopping malls. ===Cambridge Shopping Centres Limited=== While Ivanhoe was growing, Cambridge Leaseholds Limited was founded in Windsor, Ontario, in 1960, by members of the Tabachnik and Odette families.Cambridge History: A Chronology of Major Events From 1960 to Today (May 1994) Two years later, the company opened its first Cambridge-branded shopping centre, Gateway Plaza in Windsor. Many other shopping centres were built by Cambridge throughout the decade in Ontario, New Brunswick and Alberta. Cambridge Leaseholds Limited became a public company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, in 1969. In 1971, the company opened its first Quebec shopping centre, Les Rivières, in Trois-Rivières. One year later, it built Les Galeries de Hull, also in Quebec. In 1984, Cambridge Shopping Centres Limited was created and acquired all outstanding shares of Cambridge Leaseholds Limited. Cambridge continued to grow by building or acquiring interests in shopping centres in British Columbia, Ontario and Newfoundland as well as in California, in the United States. At the start of the 1990s, Cambridge Shopping Centres Limited, with more than 1,000 employees, had real estate assets exceeding CA$2 billion. In 1992, two years after Ivanhoé was acquired by Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, it began purchasing shares in Cambridge Shopping Centres Limited. Its interest grew from 15.3% to 23.4% in 1993. ===SITQ=== thumb In the mid-1980s, while Ivanhoé and Cambridge were building and acquiring shopping centres in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec created the Société immobilière Trans-Québec (SITQ) in 1984, specializing in real estate investment, management and development. SITQ focused on three particular business sectors: office buildings and hotels, multi-residential buildings and retirement homes, and, finally, real estate investment funds. In 1991, the acquisition of the 1981 McGill College building marked a turning point in SITQ’s strategy, with a growing emphasis on high-quality office buildings in the heart of major urban centres. Two years later, the company conducted its first international acquisition, the Centre de conférences Albert Borschette in Brussels, in partnership with Compagnie immobilière de Belgique. In 1996, SITQ began negotiations to acquire five office buildings in suburban Paris’s La Défense business district. The transaction, completed in 1997, positioned SITQ as one of the major real estate owners in La Défense. Over the next few years, the Prisma, Friedland, Anjou and Adria office buildings, together with all land still available in La Défense, were added to the SITQ portfolio. The Tour T1 and Immeuble B would be erected there. Expansion continued in outside markets throughout the decade, and SITQ built a major portfolio of buildings. There were also acquisitions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and India. At December 31, 2009, the value of SITQ’s portfolio was CA$17.8 billion. ===Ivanhoé Cambridge=== In August 1999, Ivanhoe became the majority shareholder in Cambridge following a CA$331 million investment.

In all likelihood he was already duke under Desiderius, notwithstanding some Frankish sources, such as the Einhardis annales, who say that Charlemagne put him in power after the Siege of Pavia. In 776, he rebelled against his lord and, according to some, declared himself king. Charlemagne, however, had been forewarned of the revolt by Pope Hadrian I, who himself had been warned in a letter by John, Patriarch of Grado. Hadrian believed that a conspiracy of Lombards and Byzantines, led by Arechis II of Benevento, Hildeprand of Spoleto, and Raginald of Clusium, was brewing against the Franks. Thus, Charles quickly crossed the Alps and defeated him, retaking Friuli and Treviso, where he spent Easter, removing Hrodgaud from power and replacing him with Marcarius. He placed Frankish counts in the cities of Friuli. ==Further reading== *Hodgkin, Thomas. Italy and her Invaders. Clarendon Press: 1895. *Oman, Charles. The Dark Ages 476–918.

The Delta Chapter for evening students was created in 1959. Both Sigma Alpha and its Delta chapter have been come to be collectively known as Sigma Alpha Delta Honor Society. ==Mission of the Society== Since its inception, Sigma Alpha Delta's mission has been two-fold, one complementing the other. Its first purpose is Scholarship, that is, to distinguish students who excel academically. Baruch College's best students are brought together through the society where they can socialize and form lasting friendships. The society's second and more important purpose is Service. Its members use their acumen, combined with good character, to help other Baruch students in whatever way possible and to better their environment. The combination of these two functions has made Sigma Alpha over the years more integral to the infrastructure of Baruch College than any other society and unique in its mission. Sigma Alpha's constitution (quoted taken from the Lexicon of 1959) stated: > “The purposes of the society are to develop, coordinate and improve the co- > curricular life in the College, to foster closer relationships between > faculty and students, and to instill in its members a spirit and idealism > which will inspire them to lead their fellow students in working for the > enhancement of the college.” ==History== The original logo Sigma Alpha Honor Society (ΣΑ) was born in 1932 as an elite honor society. At the time, the college was called “The School of Business and Civic Administration” until 1953 when it was renamed to Baruch College. The college was part of the City College of New York (CCNY) which had two branches, one uptown and one downtown. The “downtown campus” was located in the landmark 18 Story building on the corner of 23rd St and Lexington Ave, New York City, which now is a part of Baruch. This downtown campus was founded in 1919 and, in turn, replaced the previous name of “The Free Academy” that was founded in 1847 which was the first free public institution of higher education in the nation. ==Membership Selection== There are four ranks of membership within the Society, with the following requirements: • Registered – Must be an undergraduate student of the College, must have and completed a number of at least 30 academic credits if entered the College as a freshman, or a minimum of 18 credits if entered the College as a transfer student, must have and maintain an average GPA not below 3.50 and must register as a member on the society's website. • Active – Must be a Registered Member, must either maintain a minimum of 35 activity credits or pay the Membership Contribution for each academic year, must pledge the Oath of Membership upon receiving the Certificate of Induction. Only Active members can be inducted in the Society. • Former – Must be a former active member who can no longer maintain the minimum required number of activity credits per semester or pay the membership contribution, but who is not yet Alumni. • Alumni – Must have been active for at least one academic year and upon graduation must request his/her status to be upgraded to Alumni ==Notable membersTraditional Members=== * Abraham Briloff - Professor of Accounting; Owner, AJ & LA Briloff, CPAs * Stanley Kaplan - Founder of Kaplan, Inc. * Christofer Garner ===Honorary Members=== *Bernard Baruch - Financier, statesman, and presidential adviser *Felix Frankfurter - Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court *Dr. Jonas Edward Salk - Developer of the first polio vaccine ==References== ==External links== * Category:Honor societies Category:Student organizations established in 1932 Category:1932 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Sigma Alpha Delta"},{"id":"9084127","text":"Sammons in middle age Albert Edward Sammons CBE (23 February 188624 August 1957) was an English violinist, composer and later violin teacher. Almost self-taught on the violin, he had a wide repertoire as both chamber musician and soloist, although his reputation rests mainly on his association with British composers, especially Elgar. He made a number of recordings over 40 years, many of which have been re-issued on CD. == Life == Albert Sammons was born in Fulham, the second eldest of four children. His father was a shoemaker and good amateur violinist. Sammons started to receive some lessons from his father around the age of seven. Apart from these lessons, he was virtually self-taught. His first professional engagement was in the band at the Earls Court Exhibition in 1898; the conductor was so impressed by the 12-year-old that he made him leader. He left school at this time and became a professional musician – partly to bring extra income to the household, as his father was a compulsive gambler.Wetherell E. Albert Sammons violinist. Thames Publishing, London, 1998. Sammons's father took both Albert and his eldest brother Tom to symphony concerts at St James's Hall and Queen's Hall. The boy began to gain a reputation for his reliability and was engaged by many London musical establishments, as well as in the 'Hungarian' and 'White Viennese' bands popular at the time. Sammons also received a few free lessons from the Eugène Ysaÿe-trained Spanish violinist Alfredo Fernandez. At 16, relations with his father reached a point where Albert and his brother left home to stay with friends, only returning when his father walked out to join the band on an ocean liner and the two brothers were therefore obliged to provide for the rest of the family. His first concerto performance was the Mendelssohn E minor Concerto at the Kursaal Concert Hall in Harrogate in 1906. He married Laura Tomkins in Middlesbrough on 31 October 1907 (divorced 1920). Around this time Sammons was recruited to play at musical parties for the upper classes at their country houses. He was the leader of the British Symphony Orchestra in a series of Amalgamated Musicians' Union Sunday concerts at the London Coliseum in 1908–1909. Conductors of the concerts included Jimmy Glover and Alick Maclean. Held at British Library, Collections. He was also engaged by Ernesto Bucalossi at the Waldorf Hotel and Wyndham's Theatre. It was at the Waldorf that Thomas Beecham heard him and in August 1909 offered him the position of sub-leader (soon to be leader) of his orchestra,Jefferson A. Sir Thomas Beecham. MacDonald and Janes's, London, 1979. which later included opera seasons at Covent Garden, and the 1911 Diaghilev season. He also consolidated his solo career by playing the Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1 with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall in 1910. The conductor Adrian Boult commented on his rise in British violin-playing, \\"he had had no special preparations, no training abroad, no scholarship luxuries\\".Boult, A. Albert Sammons tribute broadcast, 1957. In: Boult on music. Toccata Press, London, 1983. In 1910, with Thomas Petre (second violin), Warwick Evans (cello), and Harry Waldo Warner (viola) he formed the London String Quartet, with whom he remained until 1917. The quartet gave concerts mainly in the UK but travelled to Amsterdam and Paris, with a repertoire extending from the classical period to contemporary works – including Verklärte Nacht in the presence of the composer.Potter Tully, \\"Britain's early chamber ambassadors\\", Classical Recordings Quarterly, Autumn 2010, p12-20. Sammons, William Murdoch (piano), Lionel Tertis (viola) and Lauri Kennedy (cello), founded The Chamber Music Players in 1921, giving their first private performance on 6 January of that year, and first public concert at Haverstock Hill, London on 13 January, going on to give many concerts at the Wigmore Hall and around the UK. He mainly appeared in the UK, although he did lead the Beecham orchestra for a six-week season with the Diaghilev company at the Kroll Opera House, Berlin in 1913 and, having played under Pierre Monteux for the Diaghilev seasons, was invited to lead the orchestra at the Casino de Dieppe, giving two concerts a day, and extending both his orchestral and chamber music repertoire.Potter T. Liner note to Naxos Historical CD transfer, 2002. Sammons was particularly associated with Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto in B minor, which he first played on 23 November 1914. He made the first complete recording of the concerto on 18 March and 10 April 1929 with the New Queen's Hall Orchestra conducted by Sir Henry Wood, which displays \\"wonderfully assured portamenti carried as if on the breath of a great singer\\" and \\"immense structural strength\\". He estimated that he played the concerto over a hundred times, including at The Proms. He gave his last performance of the Elgar on his 60th birthday in 1946, with George Weldon conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He also made the first recording of Elgar's Violin Sonata in E minor in 1935.The Music Parlour ~ Historical Among other concertos in his repertoire were those by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruch, and the Mozart G major. In May 1915 a chance encounter in London with Frederick Delius led directly to the composition of a violin concerto in which Sammons probably assisted considerably even to the point of writing some link passages.The view of Hugh Bean, quoted in Wetherell E. Albert Sammons violinist. Thames Publishing, London, 1998. On 13 July 1916 Sammons gave the first UK performance of the Violin Sonata of Claude Debussy, only six weeks after its Paris premiere. After the end of the First World War, Sammons all but gave up string quartet and orchestral playing to concentrate on a large, regular programme of solo work and chamber music recitals throughout Britain and Ireland, and later, broadcasts. He played a part in the rehabilitation of Fritz Kreisler, by presenting (along with Dame Nellie Melba) a laurel wreath at the Austrian violinist's first appearance in England after the war. Between May and the autumn of 1929 Sammons and Tertis carried out around 1,000 string auditions for the formation of the new BBC Symphony Orchestra. He married Olive Hobday (the daughter of one of his accompanists) on 5 December 1921. Shortly after, they moved to Bognor Regis (in the same road as William Murdoch), where he lived for the rest of his life. During the Second World War, he continued his busy concert schedule around the UK, travelling by train, as well as appearing at the National Gallery concerts. From 1946 Sammons spent less time playing and more teaching. As a teacher, he had worked at the Midland Institute in Birmingham from the 1920s, but from 1939 he taught privately and at the Royal College of Music. His pupils included Alan Loveday, Hugh Bean and Samuel Kutcher.Radio Times Samuel Kutcher violinist. Radio Times 13 February 1925. He became a Fellow (FRCM) in 1944. He composed many short pieces for violin and piano, which he included in his recital programmes and recorded.Dibble J. Liner notes accompanying Hyperion CD The English Kreisler – Violin music of Albert Sammons, 2000. A Cradle Song of 1915 is dedicated to his second daughter and the Lullaby of 1923 to the third, Colleen. His Phantasy Quartet of 1915 won the Cobbett Prize. He also made editions of others' works and published books of studies and exercises. The onset of Parkinson's disease forced his retirement from public performance in June 1948. He attended a testimonial concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 7 December in a wheelchair, and heard a tribute from Arthur Bliss, with others in the programme from Joseph Szigeti, Fritz Kreisler and Sir Adrian Boult. He died in Middleton-on-Sea in 1957, aged 71. Boult said of him after his death that he was distinguished by \\"his selfless interest in music-making of all kinds, whether in Queen's Hall or in some humble mission hall in far-off Wales or Scotland. He was a great musician in every sense of the word\\". == Instruments == His violins included a Gofriller (he bought another, 1696, Gofriller in 1927), a Felice Guadagnini, and a Nicolas Gagliano. At the Cobbett competition in February 1923 he played in a 'blind' comparison of a 1731 Stradivarius and a modern instrument by Alfred Vincent. When Sammons sold the Gofriller in 1951 he gave the new owner a list of all the works he had played on it.Wetherell E. Albert Sammons violinist. Appendix 5.

It was also sold out on many online retailers and was amazon.co.jp's #1 selling CD. Hare Hare Yukai won the Radio Kansai Award in 2006, a subset of the Animation Kobe Theme Song Award. The very popular animated choreography accompanying the song, originally broadcast as part of the closing credits, became an Internet meme which inspired many parodies and fanmade videos on the Internet, many of which were posted on video sharing websites such as YouTube. The choreography was based on several singles by the idol group Berryz Kobo, including \\"Gag 100kaibun Aishite Kudasai\\", \\"Special Generation\\", and \\"21ji Made no Cinderella\\". * Oricon Weekly Rank Peak: #5 (Ties as highest charting release of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise.) * Weeks in Chart: 92 weeks * Sales: 123,000+ * 2006 End of Year Chart Rank: #104 Track listing # – 3:37 #* Vocals: Aya Hirano (Haruhi Suzumiya), Minori Chihara (Yuki Nagato), and Yuko Goto (Mikuru Asahina) #* Lyrics: Aki Hata #* Music: Tomokazu Toshiro #* Arrangement: Takahiro Ando # – 3:23 # – 3:37 # – 3:23 ===Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsumeawase=== was first released in Japan on June 21, 2006.

Each of the nine albums feature the ending theme song \\"Hare Hare Yukai\\". Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as Ryoko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her catch phrase \\"nyoro\\", while Ryoko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and Ryoko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his ESP; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version. ==References== *Amazon.co.jp for Saikyo Pare Parade *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 1 *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 2 *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 3 *Haruhi.tv for radio drama vol. 3 ===Notes=Suzumiya Haruhi no Yūutsu CD listing at Lantis' site * * * Category:Anime soundtracks Category:Film and television discographies Albums Category:Discographies of Japanese artists Category:Lantis (company) albums Category:Lantis (company) soundtracks ja:ハレ晴レユカイ ","title":"List of Haruhi Suzumiya albums"},{"id":"9084171","text":"Conga drums are a common part of Caribbean music across much of the areas This is a list of membranophones used in the Caribbean music area, including the islands of the Caribbean Sea, as well as the musics of Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Belize, Garifuna music, and Bermuda.

The Westfield Presbyterian Church in January 2012 ==History== The Westfield Presbyterian Church Burying Ground in January, 2012 The Presbyterian Church in the West Fields of Elizabethtown was established in 1728. A great drum was sounded to call people to services. Before then, many of these God-fearing pioneers would make the all-day trip to Elizabeth to attend services, the men carrying firearms to protect themselves from Indians. On November 5, 1734 the congregation bought , roughly the area bounded now by the back of the church cemetery on Mountain Avenue, Kimball Avenue, the middle of Mindowaskin Park and East Broad Street. The price was £20. Though the site was reduced or sold over time to about , it is the site the congregation has occupied ever since. A small building was erected. It is not known when the second building was erected, but it was probably about 1734 and was situated at the intersection of East Broad Street and Mountain Avenue. The third building was set directly behind its predecessor and was first used about 1805. The present building was erected in 1861, slightly up the hill from the previous one and the sanctuary with the large church spire remains to this day as the main building for worship. An additional building known as “Westminster Hall” was originally designated as a lecture hall. It was built in 1853 and has been added to from time to time, with the last renovation taking place in 1908. During the American Revolution, the church pastor was the Reverend Benjamin Woodruff, a staunch patriot. On June 26, 1777, he had the church bell rung to warn residents that some 14,000 British troops were approaching. Again, on June 23, 1780, the bell warned residents that the Redcoats were coming. This time, British soldiers climbed to the belfry and flung the bell to the ground. Tradition says the bell was taken to Staten Island where, later, a prisoner from Westfield heard it ringing and recognized its tone. Eventually it was returned and rehung in the belfry. Reverend Woodruff and his wife are buried under the vestibule of the present building; a plaque near the front door commemorates his long and devoted service. About 1818 the first Sunday School was started. Education was important to local Presbyterians, who gave the grounds for the first Westfield academy; and the public schools of Westfield grew out of that institution. In the early days sermons could last up to two hours. Wood stoves provided some heat, but members often brought foot warmers in the winter. Light was by candles. Muddy roads made carpets impractical; instead, the floor was covered with a thick layer of sand. Along the side of Mountain Avenue was a long row of posts to which horses were tied. Singing was conducted by a presenter who stood before the congregation, gave the pitch from a tuning fork, and sang out the tune in \\"a loud, stentorious voice\\". Before the American Civil War, church members occasionally voted to take action for or against certain civic practices. In 1847, Session successfully protested to railroad officials the running of trains through Westfield on the Sabbath. Until 1870, Session heard cases involving offenses against the civil law as well as against the discipline of the Session. Some cases involved the moral and spiritual rectitude of church members; a typical offense charged against some young men was intemperance. Others concerned absence from worship service, slander, lying, theft, etc. Long after the Revolution, religion and patriotism went hand in hand for church members. For many years each church trustee swore to support the Constitution of the United States. The present church structure, built during the early part of the Civil War, was dedicated on March 25, 1862. The congregation at that time numbered less than 250, but the new structure had a seating capacity of 800. In 1875 a pipe organ was installed. Two years later a choir loft was added and a variety of music and choral groups have been introduced over the years. The cemetery across Mountain Avenue is part of the Church property and was first used for burial about 1720. Seventy-three veterans of the Revolutionary War are buried there. Local men preparing for the War of 1812 are said to have trained on the church grounds. Others fought in the Civil War, the Spanish–American War and both of the 20th century world wars. Three lost their lives in World War I, twelve in World War II, and three more in the following Cold War. Embracing a theme of the Presbyterian Synod that \\"a giving church is a living church,\\" the Presbyterian Church in Westfield has for many years donated generously to missions and missionaries. The earliest record shows that the church in 1801 gave $70 \\"for gospellizing the Indians and other pious purposes\\". In 1876 there were 26 special collections taken for Home Missions, Foreign Missions and other local, national and foreign mission needs. Starting in 1904 church records contain a long list of missionaries supported wholly or in part by this church. At the end of World War II, the church sponsored six refugee families, helping them find housing and employment in the area. Further outreach to the needy in Westfield and Union County continues. Four to six times per year 14 single women and/or families who find themselves temporarily homeless are housed in the church and provided with food, beds and bathing facilities. Every Wednesday, young people and adults of the congregation, working on our \\"Agape Project,\\" prepare over 250 dinners and take them to a Presbyterian church in Elizabeth where they are served to people experiencing food insecurity. Our deacons and other members also work regularly at the huge Community Food Bank in Hillside. As the Town of Westfield has grown from a quaint rural village into a modern commuter town, so the Church has grown from a mere handful of God-fearing people to a congregation of approximately 1,600 members. Over the years, the growth of the congregation and of the Sunday Church School, founded in 1818, made necessary increases in the buildings on the campus of The Presbyterian Church in Westfield. The first part of the Parish House was completed in 1926 and a large addition, including the Chapel and Assembly Hall was finished in 1949. The building known as Westminster Hall was originally called a Lecture Room. It was built in 1853 and has been added to from time to time, the last renovation taking place in 1958. Extensive changes were made in the main Church building, when a chancel was added and a new organ installed in 1952. Following World War II, the Church experienced a huge increase in membership. By 1962 it had reached a peak of 4,569 members and the decision was made to add more seating capacity by \\"stretching\\" the sanctuary building to 1,000 seats. During 1964 and 1965, the sanctuary was split in two and the front section of the church containing the narthex and the spire was moved forward to increase the seating capacity in the church. This remarkable project actually added to the sanctuary without noticeable change to the interior or exterior appearance of the building. You can see the “split lines on the sanctuary walls which clearly mark the expansion. The “Christian Education” building was added on as a part of the 1964 construction and built for the rapidly expanding Sunday school program. In 1997, using money from several bequests, a major renovation of the sanctuary was made. The scope of the work included a new sound system, carpet, enlarged Narthex, air conditioning, new lighting system and chandeliers, redesigned chancel, sound enhancement and accessibility improvements. In 2007, a new terrace project was completed and gives the church a safe and welcoming entryway. A complete history of The Presbyterian Church in Westfield is available in the church library, and members of the staff are always glad to conduct visitors through the buildings. With advance notice, group tours through The Presbyterian Church Cemetery can be arranged. The Church is featured prominently in the opening credits of the NBC television show Ed. Although the series took place in fictional Stuckyville, Ohio, Tom Cavannaugh (Ed) drives through Westfield, drives past the church while taking in the sites of his hometown. ==External links== *The church website Category:Presbyterian churches in New Jersey Category:Churches in Union County, New Jersey Category:Westfield, New Jersey ","title":"Presbyterian Church (Westfield, New Jersey)"},{"id":"9084266","text":"Daniel Mozes (born September 15, 1983) is an American former football center who last was a member of the Minnesota Vikings the National Football League (NFL).

He, and the back he blocked for, Steve Slaton, were the only Big East players named to first-team All-American team, and they were the first pair of consensus All- Americans in school history. Mozes and Slaton were also the 10th and 11th players in school history to earn the honor. On May 17, 2007, about a month after signing his deal with the Vikings in the NFL, Mozes won the 2007 Fred Schaus Captain's Award. The award is presented annually to the school's most outstanding varsity team captains. ==Professional careerPre-Draft=== Mozes left West Virginia as a senior and was expected to be a second-day pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. After the Senior Bowl, NFL Draft Countdown's Scott Wright reported that Mozes was the ninth prospect whose stock was slipping the most, saying \\"[He is a] Highly-decorated college player who lacks the physical tools for the next level.\\" ESPN reported that Mozes was their No. 8 center in the 2007 class. His effort was a big positive, while they worried about his size against NFL defenders. He was compared to Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday. Athlon Sports reported that Mozes was their eighth center in the class as well. They said his \\"good smarts and instincts\\" were a positive, while he \\"struggles to get movement off the ball.\\" In an April 19 article from Sports Illustrated.com, writer Stewart Mandel picked Mozes as the most underrated offensive lineman in the class. Mandel said,\\"...Mozes was one of the nation's best. It's hard to believe he's not worthy of a selection somewhere over the course of seven rounds.\\" ===NFL Draft=== Mozes went unselected in the 2007 NFL Draft. He was signed a day after by the Minnesota Vikings. ===National Football League career=== Mozes checked into Gage Hall on July 25, for the start of training camp.

Water drums are used all over the world, including American Indian music, and are made of various materials, with a membrane stretched over a hard body such as a metal, clay, or wooden pot. Water drumming, the ' (Spanish: drum of water), bungo, or liquindi, of African origin, is water, such as a river, which is played by striking the surface directly with one's hands. It is performed by the Baka in Africa, and in South America by the descendants of slaves, with strokes comparable to the culoepuya. ==Use== Water drums are used in Iroquois, Navajo, Cherokee, Creek, and Apache music,Green, Rayna (1999).

Wooden water drums are made either by hollowing out a solid section of a small soft wood log, or assembled using cedar slats and banded like a wooden keg. Clay drums are either handmade or an old crock is used. Wyandot and Seneca/Cayuga traditionally used a groundhog skin (daˀyęh) for the drum covering,though a piece of deer skin works well. An Iroquoian or Wendat/Wyandot drum stick is carved from a piece of hardwood with a small rounded tip. Each drum style has a unique way of tightening the hide to maximize the sound. The drum head must be both tight and saturated with water for best results. Native American Church ceremonies often use a water drum made from iron, brass or copper kettle. These styles of water drum are more common than the woodland form and can be purchased in numerous locations. The distinctive sound of the drum characteristic of the Native American Church is created because: \\"The water inside is in constant motion and produces a special resonance. The player's thumb, pressed against the drum head, holds the tone at a constant pitch which then drops a fifth or more when the pressure is relaxed between songs.\\"McAllester, David (2008).

In Winisk, radio wave signals were transmitted along the chain of stations to the SCS, then to MCL Site 070 Mount Kempis via tropospheric scatter system and finally to RCAF Station North Bay by land line. As there is no road or rail access to Winisk, an airstrip was also built to serve the base (and still exists on the site).

It was one of the few comedies Raft made in his career.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 66 ==Plot== The film tells the story of the wealthy family Van Dyke: a frustrated patriarch Dan (Walter Connolly); his self-centered wife (Billie Burke); and his spoiled children Tony (James Blakeley) and Carol (Joan Bennett). They have constant run-ins for outrageous behavior. Dan Van Dyke is sent to prison for tax evasion. His cellmate is bootlegger and fellow convicted tax evader Ricardi. The two men become friends and when Van Dyke dies from a poor heart, he puts Ricardi in charge of his interests. ==Cast== *George Raft as Ricardi *Joan Bennett as Carol Van Dyke *Walter Connolly as Mr. Van Dyke *Billie Burke as Mrs. Van Dyke *Lloyd Nolan as Tex *Wallace Ford as Finger Boston *Alan Mowbray as Alan Hamlin *Donald Meek as Uncle Wyndersham *James Blakely as Tony Van Dyke *William Tannen as Cesar *Donald Meek as Uncle Wyndersham *Frank Rice as Milkman *Frank Conroy as Raleigh ==Production== The film is based on a story by writers C. Graham Baker and Gene Towne, with the screenplay by Oliver H.P. Garrett. Raft was loaned to Columbia by Paramount Pictures to make the film. Writers Baker and Towne and actress Joan Bennett were under contract to Walter Wanger, and Wanger had an agreement to distribute his films through Paramount. Bennett was thus considered on loan-out as well.; Walter Byron was originally cast as Alec Hamlin, but was replaced by Alan Mowbray two weeks into filming. Donald Meek and James Blakely were added to cast the third week of August. Wallace Ford replaced Raymond Walburn a day later. The film was originally known as Rich Man's Daughter, but was changed to She Couldn't Take It about August 22, 1935. It was B.P. Schulberg's first film in a six-picture deal he had with Columbia Pictures. Columbia Pictures, with little space at its Gower Street studios, leased California Studios, a single-soundstage motion picture production facility a block east of Gower Street just a few days before shooting on She Couldn't Take It began on July 16, 1935. The film was the first Columbia feature shot at California Studios. Columbia's chief costume and fashion designer, Robert Kalloch, designed Bennett's wardrobe. Previously known for her demure and conservative appearance, Kalloch's gowns permanently transformed the actress into the epitome of chic. George Raft, Joan Bennett, Billie Burke, and Walter Connolly did an abbreviated version of the film's plot on Dick Powell's \\"Hollywood Hotel\\" radio program in late August 1935 to promote the film. ==Reception== The New York Times said the film \\"has a clinical interest as an example of the confused resentment against the idle rich which Hollywood has been displaying lately\\" in which the opening scenes \\"offer considerable promise for a bright-faced comedy of society foibles\\" but which went downhill once Walter Connolly's character died. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"George Raft's best picture\\" with an \\"inventive scenario\\" and \\"unexpected twists\\". After making the film, Tay Garnett went on an around the world cruise. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== *She Couldn't Take It at the TCM Movie Database * * *Review of film at Variety Category:1935 films Category:1930s screwball comedy films Category:American films Category:American screwball comedy films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Tay Garnett Category:Films produced by B.

Collusion in baseball is formally defined in the Major League Baseball Collective Bargaining Agreement, which states \\"Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs.\\" 2003–2006 Basic Agreement Major League Baseball went through a period of owner collusion during the off-seasons of 1985, 1986, and 1987. Historically, owner collusion was often referred to as a \\"gentleman's agreement\\".Baseball Fever After the 1918 season, owners released all their players – terminating the non-guaranteed contracts, with a \\"gentleman's agreement\\" not to sign each other's players, as a means of forcing down player salaries.Jake Daubert by Jim Sandoval ==1966–1968== Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax Before the 1966 season, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale decided to hold joint negotiations with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Koufax and Drysdale were the team's star pitchers who had helped the Dodgers win the 1965 World Series. The Dodgers needed them if they were to have any chance of returning to the World Series in 1966. After negotiation for the first 32 days of spring training, they agreed on one-year contracts, Koufax for US$125,000 and Drysdale for $110,000, the two largest contracts in baseball history. The owners were fearful that other star players would follow their example.Meep! Meep! Baseball owners’ game of collusion ===Collective Bargaining Agreement=== In 1968, new union leader Marvin Miller negotiated baseball's first Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with team owners. The owners wanted to prohibit players from holding joint negotiations. Miller was willing to agree, provided that the ban applied to the owners as well. The owners readily agreed, and every CBA since then has included the sentence: \\"Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs.\\" ==1985–1987== Shortly after being elected commissioner in 1984, Peter Ueberroth addressed the owners at a meeting in St. Louis. Ueberroth called the owners \\"damned dumb\\" for being willing to lose millions of dollars in order to win a World Series. Later, at a separate meeting with the general managers in Tarpon Springs, Florida, Ueberroth said that it was \\"not smart\\" to sign long- term contracts. The message was obvious—hold down salaries by any means necessary. It later emerged that the owners agreed to keep contracts down to three years for position players and two for pitchers. ===Collusion I=== The free agent market following the 1985 season was different from any since the Seitz decision a decade earlier. Of 35 free agents, only four changed teams—and those four were not wanted by their old teams. Star players, such as Kirk Gibson, Tommy John and Phil Niekro, did not receive offers from other teams. The cover of the December 9, 1985 edition of Sporting News asked, \\"Why Won't Anyone Sign Kirk Gibson?\\"Doug Pappas, \\"Marginal Payroll/Marginal Wins 1985–1989\\", Baseball Prospectus, April 6, 2004 George Steinbrenner offered Carlton Fisk a contract, then withdrew the offer after getting a call from Chicago White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf.Collusions I, II . . . and III (A Hard Lesson Learned) By Maury Brown. Teams also reduced team rosters from 25 to 24 players. By December, several agents thought something was amiss, and complained to Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) president Donald Fehr. In February 1986, the MLBPA filed its first grievance, later known as \\"Collusion I.\\" ===Collusion II=== The free agent market following the 1986 season was not much better for the players. Only four free agents switched teams. Andre Dawson took a pay cut and a one-year contract to sign with the Chicago Cubs. Three fourths of the free agents signed one-year contracts. Star players that ended up back with their old teams included Jack Morris (Detroit Tigers), Tim Raines (Montreal Expos), Ron Guidry (New York Yankees), Rich Gedman (Red Sox), Bob Boone (California Angels), and Doyle Alexander (Atlanta Braves). For the first time since the start of free agency, the average major league salary declined. The average free-agent salary dropped by 16 percent, while MLB reported revenues increasing by 15 percent. This prompted the MLBPA to file a second grievance (Collusion II) on February 18, 1987. Even as this was happening, Ueberroth ordered the owners to tell him personally if they planned to offer contracts longer than three years. In September 1987, the Collusion I case came before arbitrator Thomas Roberts, who ruled that the owners had violated the CBA by conspiring to restrict player movement. ===Collusion III=== After the ruling, the owners changed their tactic, but not their intent. They created an \\"information bank\\" to share information about what offers were being made to players. Players affected included Paul Molitor, Jack Clark, and Dennis Martínez. In January 1988 the MLBPA filed its third grievance (Collusion III). On January 18, 1988, Roberts ordered the owners to pay $10.5 million in damages to the players. By then, only 14 of the 1985 free agents were still in baseball, and Roberts awarded seven of them a second chance as \\"new look\\" free agents. They could offer their services to any team without losing their existing contracts. On January 29, 1988, Kirk Gibson signed a $4.5 million, three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In October 1989, arbitrator George Nicolau presided over Collusion II, and found in favor of the players. Nicolau determined damages of $38 million. \\"New look\\" free agents included Ron Guidry, Bob Boone, Doyle Alexander, Willie Randolph, Brian Downing and Rich Gedman.The Economic History of Major League Baseball Michael J. Haupert, University of Wisconsin – La Crosse Collusion III damages were $64.5 million. Owners would also have to compensate the players for losses related to multi-year contracts and lost bonuses. \\"New look\\" free agents from this settlement were Jack Morris, Gary Gaetti, Larry Andersen, Brett Butler and Dave Henderson. A final settlement of the three collusion cases was reached in November 1990. The owners agreed to pay the players $280 million, with the MLBPA deciding how to distribute the money to the damaged players.Peter Ueberroth and Collusion At that time, then-commissioner Fay Vincent told the owners:Collusions I, II . . . and III (A Hard Lesson Learned) by Maury Brown. Miller largely agreed with Vincent's sentiments, saying Ueberroth and the owners' behavior was \\"tantamount to fixing, not just games, but entire pennant races, including all post-season series.\\" Later, Vincent would blame baseball's labor problems of the early 1990s, including the 1994–95 strike, on player anger at what he called the owners' theft from the players. ===Collusion and expansion=== In 2005, Vincent claimed that the owners used the majors' two rounds of expansion in the 1990s (which produced the Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays) in part to pay the damages from the collusion settlement.Interview – Fay Vincent – Former Commissioner ==2000sCollusion allegations: 2002–2003=== Players alleged that owners engaged in collusion in the 2002 and 2003 seasons.

The agreement was made with no admission of guilt.Baseball and union settle potential collusion claims By RONALD BLUM, AP Baseball Writer ===Collusion concerns: 2007=== In November 2007, the MLB Players' Union raised concerns that owners collusively shared information about free agents and possibly conspired to keep the final price of Alex Rodriguez's new free agent contract down.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3101262&campaign;=rss&source;=MLBHeadlines ===Collusion allegations: 2008=== In October 2008, the MLB Players' Association indicated that it would file a collusion grievance against the owners claiming that they conspired illegally to keep Barry Bonds from receiving a 2008 contract. The grievance was abandoned because there were no grounds to force a team to sign a player against their will, and no proof of any organized effort to shut out Bonds. ==References== ==External links== * www.mlbplayers.com * History of the Major League Baseball Players Association Collusion Baseball collusion Collusion Collusion Collusion Collusion Collusion Collusion de:Collusion ","title":"Major League Baseball collusion"},{"id":"9084398","text":"Niyog may refer to: * Niyoga, a Hindu tradition * niyog, a term for \\"coconut\\" in the Philippines == See also == * Niog, a locality in Bacoor near Manila in the Philippines ** Niog LRT Station, a proposed station * Niyog-niyogan, a species of vine ","title":"Niyog"},{"id":"9084402","text":"Long drums are a loose category of tubular membranophones, characterized by their extreme length.

Retrieved 2009-10-22 Mullen was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of George Mullen, a bookseller, and his wife Eliza, née Orson. Mullen was educated at Nuttgrove College and later at Trinity College, Dublin. At age 16, Mullen was indentured to an apothecary, but did not like the work. In 1844 Mullen was apprenticed to William Curry and Company Booksellers and some time afterwards went to England and joined the firm of Parker and Company. With his friend, George Robertson, Mullen emigrated to Australia, sailing in the Great Britain and arriving at Melbourne on 12 November 1852. Mullen went to the Western District to visit some friends and stayed for six months on a station. He then joined George Robertson as his first assistant in Melbourne and remained with him until 1857. Mullen went to London to act as buyer for Robertson, but the arrangement fell through and Mullen decided to start for himself in Melbourne. He returned with a brother, William Lowell Mullen, and a good stock of books, and began business at 35 Collins Street East in 1859. Mullen started a high-class library based on Mudie's of London which became a leading lending library in Melbourne. The book-shop was also very successful, a large stock was carried, and it was a centre of intellectual life in the city for a time. Mullen retired from business in 1889 and died while on a visit to London on 29 May 1890. Mullen was married twice, firstly to Eliza Moss (died 15 October 1868) and secondly to Wilhelmina Wild on 17 September 1870. Mullen was survived by children from both marriages.

It has been adapted several times for television and film, including a 1960 version by Alfred Hitchcock starring Steve McQueen, Neile Adams, and Peter Lorre. Neile Adams and Steve McQueen were married from 1956 to 1972. ==Plot synopsis== While vacationing at a resort in Jamaica, the narrator encounters an elderly South American man named Carlos. They are soon joined by a young American naval cadet, who boasts about the reliability of his cigarette lighter. Carlos offers to bet his Jaguar car against the American's left little finger that the American cannot ignite the lighter ten times in a row. The American accepts, with the narrator agreeing to act as referee and hold the car key, and they adjourn to Carlos' room. After Carlos has a maid bring in the necessary supplies, he ties the American's left wrist to the table and the challenge begins. After the eighth successful strike, a woman bursts into the room and forces Carlos to drop the knife he has held ready to sever the American's finger. She explains that Carlos is mentally disturbed, having played this game so often in their home country that they had to flee in order to keep the authorities from committing him to a psychiatric hospital. He has taken 47 fingers and lost 11 cars, but no longer has anything of his own to bet with; she won it all from him long ago, including the car he claimed to own. As the narrator offers the key to her, she reaches out to take it with a hand that has only its thumb and one finger still attached. ==Television adaptations== This short story was filmed as a 1960 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents starring Steve McQueen as the reluctant young gambler, Peter Lorre as Carlos, the man who bets his car, and Neile Adams (McQueen's real-life wife) as a woman McQueen's character meets. It takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada. The car itself is merely described as a convertible. Although she is wearing gloves, her index, middle, and ring fingers are missing. In this adaptation, as part of the dramatic denouement after the woman appears and effectively aborts the bet, the gambler (McQueen) tries to relieve the stress of the young woman (Adams) by lighting her cigarette. The lighter fails to start when flicked for this, a sly indicator of how narrowly the gambler avoided losing the bet. ; 1960 cast * Alfred Hitchcock as the Host * Steve McQueen as the Gambler * Peter Lorre as Carlos * Neile Adams as a Woman * Tyler McVey as the Referee * Marc Cavell as the Bellhop * Katherine Squire as Carlos' Wife * Phil Gordon as the Bartender The episode was remade in 1979 as the first episode of Dahl's television anthology series Tales of the Unexpected.

In this adaptation, the lighter successfully lights ten times. When the wife comes in, the tenth flame is blown out. Carlos is startled and drops the cleaver, nearly cutting off the young man's finger. After it is all over, he attempts to light himself a cigarette—and the lighter fails. The wife has only her index finger left. ; 1985 cast * Alfred Hitchcock as the Host (colorized 1960 introduction) * John Huston as Carlos * Melanie Griffith as the Girl * Steven Bauer as the Gambler * Tippi Hedren as the Waitress * Kim Novak as Rosa * Jack Thibeau as Bronson * Danny De La Paz as the Bellhop ==Radio adaptations== In 2009, it was dramatized on BBC Radio Four with Andrew Sachs playing the sinister old man. In 1949, the Dahl story was adapted by June Thomson for an episode of Radio City Playhouse. The adaptation, titled \\"Collector's Item\\", split the 30 minute run time with an adaptation of a Ray Bradbury story, titled \\"The Lake\\". Shortly after meeting in the bar, Carlos offers the gambler his green 1948 Cadillac parked outside. Due to the tastes of the time, some of the more grisly details were omitted from the presentation. The independent observer (the \\"referee\\") character realizes the female is a victim of the gambler, but we do not learn the exact details of the gambler's previous bets. The scene is also parodied in an episode of American Dad!, \\"Stan's Night Out\\". Stan Smith wagers his life and the lives of three men against starting a lawn mower ten times, believing he would be able to do it as he had seen a television show which instructed him how to start a lawn mower \\"the first time, every time\\". Despite this, he fails on his first go. ==Film adaptations== Dahl's story was adapted for a scene from the 1980 Tamil movie Ninaithale Inikkum, which involved a wager by a millionaire that a young man could not flick a cigarette into his lips ten times in a row without dropping it. The millionaire had put up his Toyota car against the young man's little finger. The young man managed it nine times in a row, but chickened out and refused a tenth attempt, thereby defaulting on the wager. The cigarette flick, in fact, was a signature move by iconic Tamil actor Rajinikanth. The story was also the basis for \\"The Man From Hollywood\\", the Quentin Tarantino-directed segment of the 1995 film Four Rooms. The characters in this segment explicitly discuss the 1960 Hitchcock episode adaptation, although they incorrectly refer to the title as \\"The Man from Rio\\". In this version, the lighter fails on the first try and the referee—a bellhop who has been paid $1,000 for his trouble—chops off the finger and swiftly departs. ; 1995 cast (as part of Four Rooms) * Quentin Tarantino as Chester Rush, who offers the bet * Jennifer Beals as Angela * Tim Roth as Ted the Bellhop, who acts as referee and axe-man * Paul Calderón as Norman, who accepts the bet * Bruce Willis as Leo (uncredited) \\"Cut\\", a segment of the 2004 film Three...Extremes (directed by Chanwook Park), was also inspired by the story. ==References* * Category:1948 short stories Category:Short stories by Roald Dahl Category:Works originally published in Collier's Category:1960 American television episodes Category:1985 American television episodes Category:1980 films Category:1995 films Category:2004 films Category:Fingers Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:Horror short stories Category:Mental illness in fiction ","title":"Man from the South"},{"id":"9084476","text":"South Dakota Hall of Fame The South Dakota Hall of Fame is an American award for excellence among South Dakotans.

This involves ejecting material from a \\"target\\" that is a source onto a \\"substrate\\" such as a silicon wafer. Resputtering is re-emission of the deposited material during the deposition process by ion or atom bombardment. Sputtered atoms ejected from the target have a wide energy distribution, typically up to tens of eV (100,000 K). The sputtered ions (typically only a small fraction of the ejected particles are ionized — on the order of 1 percent) can ballistically fly from the target in straight lines and impact energetically on the substrates or vacuum chamber (causing resputtering). Alternatively, at higher gas pressures, the ions collide with the gas atoms that act as a moderator and move diffusively, reaching the substrates or vacuum chamber wall and condensing after undergoing a random walk. The entire range from high-energy ballistic impact to low-energy thermalized motion is accessible by changing the background gas pressure. The sputtering gas is often an inert gas such as argon. For efficient momentum transfer, the atomic weight of the sputtering gas should be close to the atomic weight of the target, so for sputtering light elements neon is preferable, while for heavy elements krypton or xenon are used. Reactive gases can also be used to sputter compounds. The compound can be formed on the target surface, in-flight or on the substrate depending on the process parameters. The availability of many parameters that control sputter deposition make it a complex process, but also allow experts a large degree of control over the growth and microstructure of the film. ==Uses== One of the earliest widespread commercial applications of sputter deposition, which is still one of its most important applications, is in the production of computer hard disks. Sputtering is used extensively in the semiconductor industry to deposit thin films of various materials in integrated circuit processing. Thin antireflection coatings on glass for optical applications are also deposited by sputtering. Because of the low substrate temperatures used, sputtering is an ideal method to deposit contact metals for thin-film transistors. Another familiar application of sputtering is low-emissivity coatings on glass, used in double-pane window assemblies. The coating is a multilayer containing silver and metal oxides such as zinc oxide, tin oxide, or titanium dioxide. A large industry has developed around tool bit coating using sputtered nitrides, such as titanium nitride, creating the familiar gold colored hard coat. Sputtering is also used as the process to deposit the metal (e.g. aluminium) layer during the fabrication of CDs and DVDs. Hard disk surfaces use sputtered CrOx and other sputtered materials. Sputtering is one of the main processes of manufacturing optical waveguides and is another way for making efficient photovoltaic solar cells. ===Sputter coating=== Sputter-coated ant specimen (Aulacopone relicta) for SEM examination. Sputter coating in scanning electron microscopy is a sputter deposition process to cover a specimen with a thin layer of conducting material, typically a metal, such as a gold/palladium (Au/Pd) alloy. A conductive coating is needed to prevent charging of a specimen with an electron beam in conventional SEM mode (high vacuum, high voltage). While metal coatings are also useful for increasing signal to noise ratio (heavy metals are good secondary electron emitters), they are of inferior quality when X-ray spectroscopy is employed. For this reason when using X-ray spectroscopy a carbon coating is preferred. ==Comparison with other deposition methods== A typical ring-geometry sputter target, here gold showing the cathode made of the material to be deposited, the anode counter- electrode and an outer ring meant to prevent sputtering of the hearth that holds the target. An important advantage of sputter deposition is that even materials with very high melting points are easily sputtered while evaporation of these materials in a resistance evaporator or Knudsen cell is problematic or impossible. Sputter deposited films have a composition close to that of the source material. The difference is due to different elements spreading differently because of their different mass (light elements are deflected more easily by the gas) but this difference is constant. Sputtered films typically have a better adhesion on the substrate than evaporated films. A target contains a large amount of material and is maintenance free making the technique suited for ultrahigh vacuum applications. Sputtering sources contain no hot parts (to avoid heating they are typically water cooled) and are compatible with reactive gases such as oxygen. Sputtering can be performed top-down while evaporation must be performed bottom-up. Advanced processes such as epitaxial growth are possible. Some disadvantages of the sputtering process are that the process is more difficult to combine with a lift-off for structuring the film. This is because the diffuse transport, characteristic of sputtering, makes a full shadow impossible. Thus, one cannot fully restrict where the atoms go, which can lead to contamination problems. Also, active control for layer-by-layer growth is difficult compared to pulsed laser deposition and inert sputtering gases are built into the growing film as impurities. Pulsed laser deposition is a variant of the sputtering deposition technique in which a laser beam is used for sputtering. Role of the sputtered and resputtered ions and the background gas is fully investigated during the pulsed laser deposition process. ==Types of sputter deposition== Magnetron sputtering source Sputtering sources often employ magnetrons that utilize strong electric and magnetic fields to confine charged plasma particles close to the surface of the sputter target. In a magnetic field, electrons follow helical paths around magnetic field lines, undergoing more ionizing collisions with gaseous neutrals near the target surface than would otherwise occur. (As the target material is depleted, a \\"racetrack\\" erosion profile may appear on the surface of the target.) The sputter gas is typically an inert gas such as argon. The extra argon ions created as a result of these collisions lead to a higher deposition rate. The plasma can also be sustained at a lower pressure this way. The sputtered atoms are neutrally charged and so are unaffected by the magnetic trap. Charge build-up on insulating targets can be avoided with the use of RF sputtering where the sign of the anode-cathode bias is varied at a high rate (commonly 13.56 MHz). RF sputtering works well to produce highly insulating oxide films but with the added expense of RF power supplies and impedance matching networks. Stray magnetic fields leaking from ferromagnetic targets also disturb the sputtering process. Specially designed sputter guns with unusually strong permanent magnets must often be used in compensation. ===Ion-beam sputtering=== A magnetron sputter gun showing the target-mounting surface, the vacuum feedthrough, the power connector and the water lines. This design uses a disc target as opposed to the ring geometry illustrated above. Ion-beam sputtering (IBS) is a method in which the target is external to the ion source. A source can work without any magnetic field like in a hot filament ionization gauge. In a Kaufman source ions are generated by collisions with electrons that are confined by a magnetic field as in a magnetron. They are then accelerated by the electric field emanating from a grid toward a target. As the ions leave the source they are neutralized by electrons from a second external filament. IBS has an advantage in that the energy and flux of ions can be controlled independently. Since the flux that strikes the target is composed of neutral atoms, either insulating or conducting targets can be sputtered. IBS has found application in the manufacture of thin-film heads for disk drives. A pressure gradient between the ion source and the sample chamber is generated by placing the gas inlet at the source and shooting through a tube into the sample chamber. This saves gas and reduces contamination in UHV applications. The principal drawback of IBS is the large amount of maintenance required to keep the ion source operating. ===Reactive sputtering=== In reactive sputtering, the sputtered particles from a target material undergo a chemical reaction aiming to deposit a film with different composition on a certain substrate. The chemical reaction that the particles undergo is with a reactive gas introduced into the sputtering chamber such as oxygen or nitrogen, enabling the production of oxide and nitride films, respectively. The introduction of an additional element to the process, i.e. the reactive gas, has a significant influence in the desired depositions, making it more difficult to find ideal working points. Like so, the wide majority of reactive-based sputtering processes are characterized by an hysteresis-like behavior, thus needing proper control of the involved parameters, e.g. the partial pressure of working (or inert) and reactive gases, to undermine it. Berg et al. proposed a significant model, i.e. Berg Model, to estimate the impact upon addition of the reactive gas in sputtering processes. Generally, the influence of the reactive gas' relative pressure and flow were estimated in accordance to the target's erosion and film's deposition rate on the desired substrate. The composition of the film can be controlled by varying the relative pressures of the inert and reactive gases. Film stoichiometry is an important parameter for optimizing functional properties like the stress in SiNx and the index of refraction of SiOx. ===Ion-assisted deposition=== In ion-assisted deposition (IAD), the substrate is exposed to a secondary ion beam operating at a lower power than the sputter gun. Usually a Kaufman source, like that used in IBS, supplies the secondary beam. IAD can be used to deposit carbon in diamond-like form on a substrate. Any carbon atoms landing on the substrate which fail to bond properly in the diamond crystal lattice will be knocked off by the secondary beam. NASA used this technique to experiment with depositing diamond films on turbine blades in the 1980s. IAD is used in other important industrial applications such as creating tetrahedral amorphous carbon surface coatings on hard disk platters and hard transition metal nitride coatings on medical implants. Comparison of target utilization via HiTUS process - 95% ===High-target-utilization sputtering (HiTUS)=== Sputtering may also be performed by remote generation of a high density plasma. The plasma is generated in a side chamber opening into the main process chamber, containing the target and the substrate to be coated. As the plasma is generated remotely, and not from the target itself (as in conventional magnetron sputtering), the ion current to the target is independent of the voltage applied to the target. ===High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS)=== HiPIMS is a method for physical vapor deposition of thin films which is based on magnetron sputter deposition. HiPIMS utilizes extremely high power densities of the order of kW/cm2 in short pulses (impulses) of tens of microseconds at low duty cycle of < 10%. ===Gas flow sputtering=== Gas flow sputtering makes use of the hollow cathode effect, the same effect by which hollow cathode lamps operate. In gas flow sputtering a working gas like argon is led through an opening in a metal subjected to a negative electrical potential. Enhanced plasma densities occur in the hollow cathode, if the pressure in the chamber p and a characteristic dimension L of the hollow cathode obey the Paschen's law 0.5 Pa·m < p·L < 5 Pa·m. This causes a high flux of ions on the surrounding surfaces and a large sputter effect. The hollow-cathode based gas flow sputtering may thus be associated with large deposition rates up to values of a few µm/min. ==Structure and morphology== In 1974 J. A. Thornton applied the structure zone model for the description of thin film morphologies to sputter deposition. In a study on metallic layers prepared by DC sputtering, he extended the structure zone concept initially introduced by Movchan and Demchishin for evaporated films. Thornton introduced a further structure zone T, which was observed at low argon pressures and characterized by densely packed fibrous grains. The most important point of this extension was to emphasize the pressure p as a decisive process parameter. In particular, if hyperthermal techniques like sputtering etc. are used for the sublimation of source atoms, the pressure governs via the mean free path the energy distribution with which they impinge on the surface of the growing film. Next to the deposition temperature Td the chamber pressure or mean free path should thus always be specified when considering a deposition process. Since sputter deposition belongs to the group of plasma- assisted processes, next to neutral atoms also charged species (like argon ions) hit the surface of the growing film, and this component may exert a large effect. Denoting the fluxes of the arriving ions and atoms by Ji and Ja, it turned out that the magnitude of the Ji/Ja ratio plays a decisive role on the microstructure and morphology obtained in the film. The effect of ion bombardment may quantitatively be derived from structural parameters like preferred orientation of crystallites or texture and from the state of residual stress. It has been shown recently that textures and residual stresses may arise in gas-flow sputtered Ti layers that compare to those obtained in macroscopic Ti work pieces subjected to a severe plastic deformation by shot peening. == See also == * Coating ==References== ==Further reading== *The Foundations of Vacuum Coating Technology by D.

He has twelve seasons of National Hockey League (NHL) coaching experience, serving as an assistant coach for various teams and head coach of the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres. He has also spent time coaching in the American Hockey League (AHL) and ECHL along with coaching in Europe including stints as the Slovenian and Hungarian national ice hockey teams. He is a current assistant men's ice hockey coach at Lindenwood University. == Playing career == Sator played college hockey for Bowling Green State University. During his senior year, the 1971–72 season, for the Falcons, Sator played 27 games, where he tallied 5 goals and assisted on 6 others; helping the Falcons finish the season with a record of 21-10-2. He was also selected to play with the U.S. World Team in Lake Placid, New York. Following his collegiate career, Sator joined the Long Island Ducks of the Eastern Hockey League (EHL) in the following year. Sator's playing career came to an end due to a knee injury after only playing three games for the Ducks. == Coaching career  Professional coaching career === Sator began his coaching career in the early 1980s, serving as head coach of Rögle BK for the 1982-83 season in the Swedish Division 1 league. That same year he also spent time as a scout for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League. Sator joined the Flyers coaching staff the following season, becoming assistant coach under head coach Bob McCammon during the 1983-84 season and head coach Mike Keenan during the 1984–85 season. Sator was named head coach of the New York Rangers in 1985 and led the team to the Conference Finals in his first year when the team lost to the eventual Stanley Cup Champion Montreal Canadiens. The following season, General Manager Craig Patrick was replaced by Phil Esposito and after only 23 games into the season Sator was replaced by Tom Webster. Sator quickly found a new position when he became head coach of the Buffalo Sabres the following year. In his first full season with the Buffalo Sabres they achieved the biggest point improvement in the NHL. He coached them to two third-place finishes but was unable to get the team past the Stanley Cup finalist Boston Bruins in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and was relieved of his coaching duties in 1989. Over the next two seasons, Sator was an assistant coach with the Boston Bruins before traveling to Italy to become head coach of the HC Devils Milano of the Serie A in 1991. Sator's team went undefeated on in his first season as head coach of the Devils and won the Serie A championship. Sator led the Devils to back-to-back Serie A league championships when the team won again in 1993. Sator returned to the United States and NHL the following season, taking an assistant coaching position with the St. Louis Blues. After two seasons in St. Louis, Sator spent the next two seasons as assistant coach of the Hartford Whalers, and Vancouver Canucks (where he split time between Vancouver and the Canucks American Hockey League farm team, the Syracuse Crunch. Beginning in 1997, Sator began a successful five year coaching stint with the New Orleans Brass, where he was also Director of Player Personnel. During his tenure with the Brass, the team made the ECHL playoffs every season and never had a losing season record. Sator returned to Europe after the Brass folded in 2002. Sator became the head coach of the Espoo Blues in the SM-liiga for the 2003-2004 season. From 2007 to 2009 he served as head coach of the Hungarian Austrian Hockey League team Alba Volán Székesfehérvár. In 2009, he was hired as head coach of the KHL Medveščak, based in Zagreb, Croatia. In the team's first season in the Austrian Hockey League the team qualified for last Playoff seed. The team stunned top seeded Graz 99ers in the Quarterfinals, winning the series in six games, before suffering elimination to eventual champions EC Red Bull Salzburg in the semi-finals. === Amateur and collegiate coaching career === Sator then moved back to St. Louis, Missouri in 2011 and became assistant hockey coach for Lafayette High School, located in Wildwood, Missouri. For the 2011-2012 season Sator was hired as assistant coach of the Lindenwood University men's ice hockey team. He joins the team under head coach Rick Zombo, a former NHL defenseman who played for the St. Louis Blues during Sator's tenure as assistant coach for the Blues in the early 1990s. === International coaching career === Sator served as Bob Johnson's assistant coach for Team USA on two Canada Cup teams and has sat on the Executive Board of USA Hockey. He was assistant coach with United States men's national ice hockey team in Vienna for the 1996 World Championships where the team took its first medal in 36 years. Sator served as the head coach of the Slovenian national ice hockey team during the 2006-2007 season, bringing them back into the A Pool. Later he obtained a position as the head coach of the Hungarian national ice hockey team from 2009 to 2011. ===Coaching statistics (NHL head coach)=== { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"3\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" ID=\\"Table\\" - ALIGN=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He was an early member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society in 1839. It was William and Stephen Grellet who introduced Elizabeth Fry to her life's work with prisons, but it was William's brother, Josiah, who accompanied Fry on her tour and inspection of prisons in France.Elizabeth Fry by ER Pitman ==Biography== Forster was born in 1784. He initially trained as a land agent with his mother's brother in Sheffield, but he then started to tour England and Scotland as a minister. He visited the Hebrides in 1812 and Ireland in 1813–14. When visiting Newgate prison with Stephen Grellet, Forster was amazed at its state. He contacted Elizabeth Fry and she gathered together a group of women to help with improving prison conditions. Forster thereby alerted Elizabeth Fry to what was to be her life's work. In 1816, Forster married Anna Buxton and they moved to Dorset. When his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, entered parliament in 1818, he wrote to him to encourage him to take up the cause of slavery. He noted that the slavery trade had been abolished (in 1807 in the British Empire) but there was still the issue of those who were already slaves.Memoirs of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, Baronet With Selections from His Correspondence, By Thomas Fowell Buxton, Charles Buxton, accessed 15 July 2008 Doctrinal differences within the Quakers were created by the views of Elias Hicks of New York. Forster highlighted the issue in 1820. Prominent English evangelical Quakers which included Elizabeth Robson, Forster and Anna Braithwaite, decided to travel to the United States to denounce Hicks' views between 1821 and 1827. Meanwhile, following the Reform Act, William Wilberforce was able to get anti-slavery legislation through parliament. In 1838 legislation replaced slavery with apprenticeship. As a result, in August 1838 800,000 people in the British Empire became nominally free.Slavery and Abolition, ODNB, accessed 10 July 2008 A picture was commissioned showing William Forster as a member of the new British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society which was formed in 1839 at an important international convention in June 1840. The small extract shown here includes only Samuel Gurney—a banker and fellow Quaker—Forster, and William Allen. Also in this painting are William's brothers, Robert and Josiah Forster. This new society's aim was \\"The universal extinction of slavery and the slave trade and the protection of the rights and interests of the enfranchised population in the British possessions and of all persons captured as slaves.\\" In 1842-3 a schism developed in the Society of Friends in Salem in Iowa. The difference developed over the ways that the society should support the abolition of slavery, which was still an important part of the American economy. A rival meeting house had been created and a new burial ground purchased which was separated from the older Quaker burial ground by a mere two feet of ground. Four delegates were sent from Britain: Forster, his brother Josiah, George Stacey (pictured above) and John Allen. The difference between the two groups was the level to which they should publicly oppose slavery. It was the group who most supported abolition that had created a minority group called the Abolition Friends.Iowa History Project accessed 17 July 2008 The group did not manage to heal the divide immediately but it was resolved by 1848.The Anti-Slavery Friends in Salem, Iowa, Lewis D. Savage, accessed 16 July 2008 Forster and his wife visited France in July 1845 at the invitation of the French to try to establish links with the French abolitionists. They found activity in Paris, but were disappointed to find that there was little activity in the country in general.French Anti-slavery: The Movement for the Abolition of Slavery in France ==Final journey== Friendsville. In 1849 the yearly meeting of the Quakers requested that Forster visit the rulers of the Christian nations.New International Encyclopedia Forster visited many of the European rulers to forward the abolitionists' cause, but it was in 1853 that he and three others visited the American president, Franklin Pierce, and journeyed to spread the message to the governors of the southern American states, eventually meeting thirteen of them. It was during this journey that Forster died and was buried in the Quaker town of Friendsville in Tennessee (which was on the Underground Railroad).Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of an Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 125. The Fireside poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, wrote a poem in William's memory; on Forster's first visit to America he had visited the home of Whittier's parents.William Forster, a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier accessed 14 July 2008 Forster's son William Edward Forster was an MP who campaigned for universal education. ==Works== *Memoirs of William Forster: In Two Volumes, William Forster, Benjamin Seebohn, 1865 ==References== ==Sources== *Memoirs of the Life and Gospel Labours of Stephen Grellet, Stephen Grellet, 1862 Category:People from Tottenham Category:1784 births Category:1854 deaths Category:English Quakers Category:Philanthropists from London Category:English abolitionists Category:19th-century English clergy Category:19th-century philanthropists Category:Christian abolitionists ","title":"William Forster (philanthropist)"},{"id":"9084591","text":"Money Run is the third solo studio album by American rapper Bad Azz from Long Beach, California.

Three explorers from earth, U.S. Navy Captain David M.

Each day, several images and a bit of the story were presented documenting the experience (in a sort of \\"static laden transmission\\") form. Often details would be kept obscure to heighten the sense of mystery. Imagery for EON-4 was created by compositing still photography over 3D rendered graphics and adding various effects. The creators of EON-4 implemented a BBS for direct dialogue between the creators and audience. Another board was set up where fans engaged in roleplaying within the storyline.

He left school at 17, lived at Clifton and did some writing for the London press. He then returned to Barbados and for about 18 months taught at Codrington College. About the end of 1855 he went to Montreal and later to Glasgow. He worked as an army coach and also contributed to leading reviews; he had articles on Defoe and on Montaigne in the British Quarterly Review, in 1858. A collection of his articles was published in 1860, Ethica: or Characteristics of Men, Manners and Books. He was appointed editor of the Melbourne Argus not long afterwards, but resigned on a question of policy after holding the position for two and a half years. Windsor subsequently went to live at Castlemaine and edited the Mount Alexander Mail for three years. In 1872 he succeeded James Harrison as editor of The Age, and continued in this position for 28 years. It was a period of great importance for Victoria which saw the transition from a colony depending principally on the pastoral industry and gold-mining, to one in which agriculture and manufacturing were to be even more important. David Syme, as proprietor of the Age, directed its policy, and there were periods when he practically ruled Victoria. Windsor's vigorous and gifted mind was the medium through which Syme's ideas were brought before the public. The literary power of his leaders and other contributions was strongly felt by their readers, and Windsor's influence on the period marked him as one of the great journalists of his time.

He held the position of administrator of personnel and finance until 1940, when Sam Houston Jones succeeded Earl Kemp Long as governor. Thereafter, he served in numerous state appointed posts. Guglielmo succeeded Rufus D. Hayes as insurance commissioner in 1964, after Hayes declined to seek re-election. Guglielmo defeated four candidates in the Democratic primary in 1963, defeating State Representative Jack M. Dyer of Baton Rouge and state senator Speedy O. Long of La Salle Parish. Guglielmo carried the backing of defeated gubernatorial candidates Shelby M. Jackson, Robert F. Kennon, Claude Kirkpatrick, and Gillis Long.Minden Press, November 4, 1963, p. 12 HE went on to win the general election in March 1964. During his first term in office, he had to deal with the fallout of Hurricane Betsy, which had killed 67 people in Louisiana. In 1967, Guglielmo ran again for state commissioner, presenting himself as a candidate who opposed higher insurance rates, which he had voted against. He defeated four opponents, John W.

In Guglielmo's second term, several insurance companies failed to pay claims in a timely manner and forced the insured to accept lower amounts by with-holding payment until the insured was desperate. Guglielmo worked to require claims be paid more faithfully and also backed the claims of numerous insurance agents against a number of the companies. His failure to clarify and advertise these actions may have cost him a third term. In 1971, Guglielmo faced the combined competition of once again John W. Davidson as well as Jerry Galliano and Sherman Bernard. Guglielmo was defeated in a runoff election by Bernard, Guglielmo subsequently ran an agency which serviced insurance companies. In 2004, Guglielmo was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in the Long's native Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish. \\"I'm just very honored to even be here\\", said Guglielmo, a 42-year state employee. \\"I had no idea they had such a place.

Sitting models also exist, but with direct bodily contact with the urinal.Ad for unisex urinal in Norwegian Magazine Norsk Hytteliv nr 3 2011 - Reklame for unisex-urinal mentioning sit-down model Unisex urinals are also marketed by various companies, and can be used by both sexes. Female urinals and unisex urinals are much less common than male urinals. Urinals are more abundant in men's and boys' public toilets than in the facilities in private homes. ==BackgroundAdvantages compared to toilets for urination=== Urinals for female users could potentially have some of the same advantages as urinals for male users as compared to toilets (with regards to urination):Kyriakou, D., & Jackson, J. (2011): We Know Squat About Female Urinals. Plumbing Connection, (Autumn 2011), 54 (PDF-document) * lower cost * simpler maintenance * smaller space requirements (several urinals may be installed on the floor space of a single toilet cubicle) * reduced water consumption for flushing compared to flush toilets (waterless urinals can even function without any flushing water) * more hygienic, contact-free urination process (and no risk of soiling with feces from previous users) * faster use * easier recycling of nutrients as fertilizer Due to an increased number of units in the same amount of floor space, there is usually a faster and shorter queue for public urinals; up to 30% more people can use the toilet facilities at the same time. Female urinals could possibly be suitable for use in public toilets which are heavily used during peak hours and which are likely to attract large numbers of visitors, especially places like theaters, stadiums, schools, universities, discotheques, shopping centers, and public transit facilities. In addition, temporary mobile female urinals have been developed for use at open-air events and festivals, as well as free-standing units for public spaces. ==Design and implementation== Announcement of women's urinals in front of a public toilet in Frankfurt am Main, Germany Urinals are being developed that can be used by both sexes. While urinals for men and boys can be found almost everywhere in public toilets, unisex and female urinals are still niche products. Many people feel that this is satisfactory because of obvious biological differences that make use of a urinal more convenient for the male population than it would be for the female population. According to Mete Demiriz, professor of sanitary technology at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences in Gelsenkirchen, economic considerations and social conventions also prevent the wider installation of female urinals in public toilets. The female urinal models offered today are conceptually similar to each other and follow the shape and design of male urinals but are more closely tailored to the female anatomy. One difference is most females chose to stand with their back toward the urinal and adopt a half-squatting position, which is also sometimes called the \\"skier's posture\\" or \\"hovering stance\\". This is based on the posture that females generally adopt in conventional public toilets if they are dirty and when physical contact is not desired, but hovering may leave urine behind in the bladder and may not be good for the pelvic floor muscles. Thus some people hover only in cases of dire necessity. In countries where squat toilets are the norm, female urinals can also be found as a ceramic pan at floor level. This kind of urinal would be used in a full squat position to avoid splashing back of urine. In the past, models that were used in a full squat (similar to Asian squat-style toilets) have been developed to the prototype stageDemiriz, M. (2010). Female urinals.

Katie Van Syckle, The Cut, 12 August 2017. Retrieved 10 March 2018. ===Locations===  Female and unisex urinals in public toilets Women's urinal \\"Lady P\\" at the Dortmund Airport, Germany In the 1990s, a number of prototypes were developed for female urinals, of which only three were finally ready for the market and are now used: the \\"Lady P\\" by Sphinx Sanitair, the \\"Lady Loo\\" by GBH and the \\"Girly\\" by Ceramica Catalano, which has won several design awards. Since the 2000s, female urinals have been introduced in a few European public toilets, with more models, like \\"Ona\\" designed by Cajsa Flensburg, \\"madamePee\\" founded by Nathalie des Isnards (2018), \\"Lapee\\" created by Gina Périer (2019), and \\"Marcelle\\" (2019), having been developed. In the course of the development towards unisex toilets, designers and developers are increasingly faced with the challenge of creating gender-appropriate solutions. Models, like \\"We P\\" designed by Michal Farago, \\"Captain\\" by Uridan, \\"Ti'Pi\\" by Ves Bat Eco and \\"Weestand\\" by LiquidGold, have been developed that can be used comfortably by females and males alike. Berlin now has some unisex toilets and unisex urinals, to be used by both sexes. , with the expiration of a contract for public toilets with Wall GmbH, a new toilet concept for public spaces in Berlin is being developed. Urinals which can be used in a similar fashion (facing the wall) by both sexes are an essential part of the future unisex toilet facilities. ==Problems with implementation== At present, two different arrangements are currently being implemented in practice: a row arrangement (usually with a partition as a separating element), comparable to male urinals; and in individual booths or cabins, as in classic toilets. The main advantage compared to the classic toilet, compact space requirements, is lost with the latter design. With a row arrangement, the density of facilities can be increased, resulting in shorter wait times. However, this is not the case with the booth arrangement, in which a classic toilet bowl is simply replaced by a urinal. The booth solution is often proposed with the argument that female use of open urinals is socially unacceptable and associated with embarrassment. However, urination while in the company of others can be a problem for some males as well. There is always the possibility to switch to a classical toilet stall if the use of urinals is associated with shame (e.g. in the case of paruresis). Unisex urinals (#2) which may be used by both men and women, combining features of a female- (#1) and male- (#3) only urinal Wall- mounted urinals that are usable by men and women, in open row arrangement This problem arises more in the context of increasing trends towards unisex toilets for males and females. A sharing of toilets raises the question of how urinals should be arranged for both sexes in the room. While toilets are usually housed in booths with lockable doors, urinals are usually installed openly in a row in gender-separated toilets. This construction method requires less space, allows for more people to urinate at the same time while promoting better hygiene and economics, and keeps the toilet stalls cleaner and more available for those who need them - which is currently one of the main advantages of installing male urinals. One possibility would be to continue offering urinals in rows. These could, whether separated into male and female urinals or as unisex urinals, be separated by so-called \\"pubic walls\\". However, it is questionable whether the lower level of privacy compared to conventional toilets would be accepted by the general public. Due to socio- cultural conventions, the concept of men/boys urinating with their backs visible to women/girls would possibly create awkwardness for both genders and would currently seem strange and contrary to common morals and etiquette for many users. There are even more practical issues for females, such as women/girls needing toilet paper, having to lower their pants, and sometimes tending to their menstrual hygiene needs while going to the toilet for urination. An alternative would be to accommodate urinals for both sexes in booths or to continue offering urinals for males only. However, this would at least limit the above-mentioned advantages of the urinals for females. Accordingly, the German lawyer and author Marcus Werner sees a significant disadvantage in unisex toilets if these would lead to the elimination of urinals in classic open rows. Urinals arranged in booths have not been popular, since the advantages compared to conventional toilets were not obvious, given the unchanged space requirement. After 13 years, the four ladies' urinals in the Salzburg Congress Center were removed in August 2015 due to a lack of interest. They have been replaced by conventional toilets. In the unisex toilets planned for the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin (Texas) in 2017, the urinals are to be located in an area separated from the entrance area by a door. These are designed as unisex urinals and are arranged in open rows within this range. This would allow men and women to use side-by-side urinals in this room, preferably with both genders standing with their face towards the wall, while those who prefer to not see persons of the opposite sex urinating may use a traditional toilet booth nearby. According to Richard Weiss, the architect who is planning this restroom, this would create the greatest possible freedom of choice for all genders. ==History 19th and early 20th century === Recent developments in creating urinals for females and for use by both sexes are not a new revolution in sanitation, as some manufacturers suggest. Rather, it is the renaissance of a concept whose roots lie in the 19th century. During the 19th century, in the early days of public toilet development, female urinals were installed and urinals were not thought of as being exclusively for males. For example, the 1897 German Handbuch der Architektur (Handbook of architecture) shows \\"women's urinals with automatic rinsing\\"; at that time the advantages featured were less costly installation and water savings: At that time, the female urinal was unable to establish itself in Germany, and they were installed only occasionally. In 1902, on the initiative of the City Building Office, a decision was taken in Munich to install women's urinals throughout the city in public convenience stores. A letter to the Kirchmair Board of Directors, for example, explains the plenary decision of the Baumagistrat on 13 February 1902: This idea was pursued further, so that the documents of 13 January 1906 contained plans for concrete implementation: In the architectural guide München und seine Bauten (Munich and its buildings) from 1912, the women's urinals in three public toilets (Lerchenfeldstraße, Ottostraße and Max-Weber-Platz) were mentioned in the chapter on \\"Nursing homes\\". In contrast to the actual toilets, these were intended as \\"freehold toilets\\", i.e. for free use. They enjoyed great popularity and were highly frequented. In the course of the 1910s, there was no further expansion, probably because the free use did not generate income for the city's treasury funds. Finally, the Freiaborte (free public lavatories) for women were converted into fee facilities. A later proposal by the first female city councillor of Munich in 1922 for the reintroduction of those free urinals was dismissed by the exclusively male directors of the Bade- und Bedürfnisanstalten establishments. This development at the turn of the century was not followed up in Germany and these first approaches were increasingly forgotten. ===1970s onwards=== Body position taken by women for urination into many female urinals: floating half squat or ″skiing position″ In the 1970s, Alexander Kira, professor of architecture and sanitary engineering at Cornell University, conducted studies on urination behavior of both genders. He pursued the goal of developing sanitary fixtures that are adapted to the human body and its needs, breaking with conventional design specifications. On a conventional toilet bowl, the \\"correct\\" use is determined by the shape of the sanitary fixture. Amongst other things, Kira investigated the body positions that males and females prefer to use when no external guidelines are given, for example while urinating outdoors. Examples include urinating in the forest, on a rock, or in a hole. He examined the trajectories of the urine stream and its controllability, as well as comfort and health aspects of different body positions. Males usually urinate in a standing posture and direct the stream forward by hand. Females prefer to take a squatting position with the stream controlled by the posture of the entire body and directed vertically downwards to slightly obliquely backwards. This position is generally the most comfortable for females and is associated with the lowest spray dispersion.Möllring, B.

Temple University Press, Kira, A. K. (1976): The bathroom. Penguin Books Until the 1970s, a few female urinals were available in the United States from different manufacturers, such as the Sanistand by American Standard Companies. In the 1980s and 1990s various concepts and prototypes were proposed, although most of them were not developed beyond the design stage. Female urinals have become more common since the turn of the millennium and are marketed commercially, primarily in Europe. From 1950 to 1973, the American Standard company marketed its mass-produced Sanistand. It did not provide significant advantages over conventional toilets, because it used just as much floor space and water for flushing. Its main selling point was that it was specifically designed for women to use without bodily contact. Several other commercially-unsuccessful designs have been tried since then, but they required the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Current clothes fashions, such as pantyhose and slacks, inhibit females from using them because they do not want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. In case any females have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to approach them forward or backward, instructions may be posted. In the early 21st century, standard trough models intended for use with a specialised disposable funnel have been introduced with some success, at outdoor festivals such as Glastonbury in 2004, to reduce dwell times and to alleviate long queues. In 2011 a portable female urinal, the Pollee, was introduced at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and was received enthusiastically by female festival visitors: ==Society and culturePublic perception=== A 1999 study surveyed 600 women to determine their interest in having female urinals which could be used in a standing position. The majority of respondents indicated a desire to have such facilities. A 2011 study conducted in Australia showed that more than half of the women interviewed would use a urinal if it were available. ===Advocacy examples=== Demand is increasing for \\"urination equality\\" (potty parity). A grassroots urination equality campaign in the Netherlands caused a sensation in 2017, with women defiantly using urinals in men's toilets. The protest movement was formed under the name of Zeikwijven (\\"the wild-peeing women\\"), which advocates urination equality and takes action against the discrimination of women through limited possibilities of urination. The initiative was triggered after 23-year-old Geerte Piening was sentenced to a fine for urinating in public on the street. Her complaint was rejected on the judicial grounds that Piening should have used a street urinal common in the Netherlands. The objection that this was designed only for men was not accepted: \\"it may not be comfortable, but it is possible\\".Vrouwen plassen gratis bij Vendor Washrooms tijdens urinoiractie #zeikwijf - vendor.nlWeinig animo onder vrouwen voor Actie Zeikwijf, toch succes - ad.nl\\"Protests planned at Amsterdam urinals over lack of women's toilets\\" - The Guardian\\"Dutch women protest lack of female-friendly public toilets\\" - dw.com According to one campaign initiator, the problem is that \\"it isn't possible for women to urinate in a decent, hygienic and dignified manner in a public urinal designed for men.\\" As part of this campaign, women in the Netherlands began to urinate demonstratively in public urinals for men. Meanwhile, the Dutch city authorities are planning to increasingly offer a unisex version of the Urilift street urinals, which are now available in Dutch city centers and can be used comfortably by men and women. == See also == *Female urination device *Pollee *Sanitation *Unisex public toilet ==References== == External links== Category:Urinals Category:Urine Category:Sanitation Category:Toilets ","title":"Female urinal"},{"id":"9084880","text":"The House Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research is a subcommittee within the House Agriculture Committee.

The Deere company briefly experimented with building its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive. ==Dain All-Wheel Drive== The Dain All- Wheel Drive was the first tractor produced by John Deere, and had only a single rear wheel. In 1911, Deere purchased the Dain Manufacturing Company of Ottumwa, Iowa. The next year, Deere decided to design its own tractor, and Dain founder Joseph Dain Sr., was directed to design that tractor. After several prototypes, the design was finalized in 1917, and 100 production units were ordered. By 1919 when that production run was complete, Deere had purchased the Waterloo Boy company. Although the Dain AWD was ahead of its time, with features such as a shift-on-the-fly transmission, Deere halted production in late 1919, partly because the cost of the Dain tractor was double that of the Waterloo Boy, and partly because of the death of Dain Sr. ==Waterloo Boy== Waterloo Boy tractor The predecessor of Waterloo Boy came about in 1892. It was made by thresherman John Froelich. It is called the Froelich tractor. Scale Models of Dyersville, Iowa made a 1/16 scale toy of this tractor. In March 1918 Deere & Company decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923. ==Model D (Spoker Model D)== John Deere model D tractor Despite a rather severe farm economy depression at the time, Deere management decided to build a Model D prototype in 1923, designed by Muir L. Frey (father of Ford Mustang designer Donald N. Frey). The Deere Model D was produced from March 1, 1923 to July 3, 1953, the longest production span of all the two-cylinder John Deere tractors. Over 160,000 were made.Placard at Western Development Museum display. The first Model D rode on steel wheels with a (later ) two-cylinder hand-cranked engine rated .Placard at Western Development Museum display. It was not, however, the first tractor to bear the Deere name - as a number of Deere experimental tractors, and the John Deere Dain \\"All Wheel Drive\\" tractor (of which approximately 100 were produced during 1918 and 1919) had all carried the Deere name before the D. By 1925, the company realized the standard Model D did not meet customers' needs for industrial applications. Steel wheels were not suitable for hard surfaces, and the gearing was too slow for safe road speeds. Solid rubber tires were added, and engineers fitted a 28-tooth sprocket to the final drive, giving a road speed of . The company replaced the two-cylinder engine with a . In 1926, Deere advertised the model as the \\"John Deere Industrial Tractor\\" with 40 × b inch rear wheels and fronts with solid tires. This became known as the \\"DI\\". Options also included wheel weights.Rukes, B. - John Deere Industrials. - ==GP tractor== On June 20, 1928, the model designation was changed from \\"C\\" to \\"GP\\" to avoid confusion with the \\"D\\" when dealers were phoning in orders to the factory. \\"GP\\" stands for \\"General Purpose\\". This new model GP had the same horsepower, engine displacement, weight and three-speed transmission as the model C. The GP's first serial number was 200211 . In 1930, the GP was updated with a 25-horsepower, 339 cubic-inch engine. The John Deere model GP was built in five distinct versions through the course of its production: * The standard- front GP, or John Deere Standard, built from March 1928 to February 1935. * The John Deere two-wheel tricycle-front GP, or GP-tricycle, of which twenty- three units were built between August 1928 and April 1929 * The John Deere GP wide-tread, or GPWT, built from November 1929 to November 1933 * The John Deere GP wide-tread Series P, a GPWT with narrowed rear tread width designed to suit potato rows, built between January and August 1930. * The John Deere General Purpose orchard tractor, or \\"GPO\\", from April 1931 to April 1935. This tractor had specialized shielding for groves and orchards and around low- hanging branches. Some GPOs were fitted with crawler undercarriages from the Lindeman Brothers in Yakima, Washington. These are commonly known as \\"GPO Lindemans\\". The John Deere Model A came off the assembly line in April 1934. The tractor was 25 hp, was 309 CID and had a four-speed transmission. There were eight different model A variations. Some of these were tricycle, hi-crop, orchard, single front tire and industrial models. The tricycle wheel design, patterned after that of the Farmall tractor, reduced steering effort and greatly increased maneuverability. The Model B was introduced in June 1934. This tractor had a shorter frame than the Model A, but it was eventually lengthened so it could use some of the same equipment that the larger models A and G used. There were also eight different Model B tractor variations, the same as the larger Model A. The much larger G model arrived in 1937. It was fitted with a 36-horsepower, 425-cubic-inch engine and a four-speed transmission. John Deere publicized the G as a three-plow tractor and it was built until 1941 when the GM (G, Modernized) replaced it. The GM model was made from 1942 to 1947. The power was increased to 38 horsepower and a new six-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractor models. The GM had electric starting and lighting added to it options. During its production time the G tractor was available as a hi-crop, single front wheel and styled. ==Unstyled row crop tractors== Deere made their first unstyled rowcrop tractor in 1929 to compete with the Farmall. It was a modified GP tractor with adjustable rear axle track (distance between wheels on the same axle) and a narrow front end. In 1933 Deere started experimenting with what would come to be known as the Model A. The new model A went into production in 1934. The A launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market. The A was by far the most popular two- cylinder tractor that Deere produced. The next year the Model B was introduced. It was one third smaller than the A which made it ideal for smaller farms. A few years later, the Model G was introduced in 1937. It remained unstyled for several more years than the A and B. The unstyled tractors launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market which they are still a major part of today. The Deere company very nearly went bankrupt in the Great Depression. Only a large order of tractors for the Soviet Union kept the company going. ==Streamlined look== In 1937 John Deere hired well known industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss from New York City to re-style Deere's agricultural equipment, especially its tractors. In the fall of 1937, a Deere tractor engineer was sent to New York to ask Dreyfuss to redesign the tractors. Legend has it that Dreyfuss was so intrigued by the project that he took a train to Waterloo that very night. Dreyfuss learned to operate the tractors and worked with them in the field to gain firsthand knowledge of the changes that needed to be made. The first two letter series tractors (the A and B) were the first to receive the new modern styling, and other models were added later. The Dreyfuss styling was intended to help John Deere compete with the forthcoming Farmall \\"letter series\\" of tractors, which, along with the Ford-Ferguson, were John Deere's largest competition at this time. Dreyfuss and the Waterloo engineers perfected the styled design that was used on all John Deere tractors with only minor changes through 1959. The 1930s and 1940s saw a large number of different John Deere models emerge, as small farmers emerging from their Depression troubles increasingly turned from horses to tractors. John Deere's GM model was introduced in 1942, and was made until 1947. Power was increased to 38 hp and a new six-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractors models. The GM had electric start and lights added to its options. During its production time the G tractor was available in hi-crop and single front wheel versions. The G was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A and B tractors the G model had the six-speed transmission added to it. In 1946, the 1946 model \\"D\\" had a 501-cubic-inch engine, which was enormous for the day. Two new additions to the tractor line, the M and R models, were also added. John Deere model M Tractor After the models A and B got new styling, both tractors were given six-speed transmissions in late 1940. The A was 29 hp out of a 321 CID engine while the smaller B was both 18 and 23 hp reflecting the earlier and later updates between 1938 and 46. The 14.84 model H was given the Dreyfuss look from the time it was introduced in 1938. The H broke a fuel economy record when it was tested in Nebraska. This tractor also had three variations that came out in 1940-'41. The H tractor was 14.84 horsepower out of a 90 CID engine and had a three-speed transmission. Model AW (1947-52, late styled) in original condition, Gulgong museum, NSW Australia In 1939, the restyled model D appeared. The D was a 42 hp tractor, and weighed 5,300 pounds. Options available on this tractor included electric lighting and starting. In August 1940 John Deere introduced the new model LA which was followed by the model LI. The LA had a 77 CID engine with 14 belt horsepower. The John Deere G tractor was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A/B tractors the G model also had the 6-speed transmission, but also featured electric lights and electric start. In 1947, John Deere opened a new tractor factory in Dubuque, Iowa, built to produce the John Deere M. The M was created to address the increasing demand for small tractors and compete with the increasingly popular Ford and the smaller Farmall tractor models. The M was the first Deere tractor to use a vertical two-cylinder engine, with a square bore and stroke of 4.0 × 4.0 inches (100.5cuin) with a high row crop. ==1949–1959: diesels and post World War II production== John Deere Model 60 1955 John Deere Model 530 1959 John Deere Model 430S Circa 1960 After years of testing, John Deere released its first proper diesel tractor in 1949, the Model R. The R was also the first Deere tractor with a 'live' independent PTO equipped with its own clutch. The R also incorporated live hydraulics. PowrTrol, as it was known, provided the operator the ability to lift equipment by the pull of a lever. A pump powered by the PTO clutch provided 1800 PSI of hydraulic pressure to a lever controlled valve. At 45 hp at the drawbar and 50 hp at the belt, it was the most fuel-efficient tractor available at the time, and this combination of features resulted in over 21,000 being built. The model R had a shipping weight of 7,670 lb. The R was equipped with two engines. The primary plant is a two-cylinder, four-stroke, naturally aspirated 416 cubic inch (5.75 X 8 bore and stroke) direct injected diesel engine with a 16:1 compression ratio. The starting motor is also a Deere two-cylinder, 26 cubic-inch horizontally opposed gasoline engine. The starting or \\"pony\\" engine is electrically started by a six-volt electrical system, and is used to crank the diesel. Testing results with various electrical starting systems for the diesel proved to be too bulky requiring a 24- or 32-volt system. The design of the pony start Rs allowed for hot exhaust gasses to preheat the intake air for the diesel and a common liquid cooling system allowed the pony engine to warm the diesel block and head. This provided sufficient cold weather starting aids for the diesel that it would reliably run in sub zero conditions. The R did have several teething problems as this was Deere's first production diesel tractor. Available as a standard tractor only, it did not have an adjustable front axle, nor did it have a three-point hitch. The engine was mainly an up-scaled gasoline engine from the Model D. The use of a thermosiphon cooling system and the lack of a three-point bearing crankshaft proved inadequate for diesel compression ratios. The R was prone to overheating and cracking the cylinder head. The lack of a center main bearing in the crankshaft allowed the shaft to flex when used as a stationary powerplant on the belt; this would lead to its failure. The live PTO was directed through (2) 45° bevel gears that proved too small to durably transmit the full torque of the engine. The tractor was fully serviceable at pulling larger equipment efficiently on large acre wheatland farms. During the 1950s, the R saw a series of upgrades in the models 80, 820 and 830. The 80 was produced for two years and 3,500 were produced. It had new features, including power steering and dual hydraulics. It developed 68 hp and weighed 8,100 pounds. The 80 also corrected the other design flaws within the R such as using a water pump and pressure radiator cap and the addition of a center crankshaft main bearing. The 820 and 830 were similar overall, but also differed in their sheet metal exteriors, fuel tank designs and color schemes. The 820, a larger version of the 720 and the 720, was basically the same as the 70, except for the model number and that the sides of the hood are painted JD yellow. The 720 was upgraded to the 730 for 1959. The 730 featured more contoured bodywork than the 720 and came with more ergonomic features for the operator. Although the 730 had a short production run it became one of John Deere's most popular models. The 730 also featured power steering and 24-volt electric starter motor instead of the V4 pony start engine. The 730 was available in diesel, gasoline and LPG as well as in row crop tricycle, row crop wide front, standard tread and hi crop wide front formats. The 730 is very popular with tractor pulling enthusiasts because of its weight, power and slow speed. Plus its good looks have become popular with tractor restorers. The 730 was a 59 hp tractor at the belt and 54 at the drawbar. After making more than 1 1⁄4 million two-cylinder tractors, John Deere switched to four- and six-cylinder engines. Announcement of the change came after seven years of development and forty million dollars in retooling. In October 1959 the company showcased a new large 215 hp 4WD, called the 8010, on the Robert Ottilie Seed Farm north of Marshalltown, Iowa. It was shown during the largest farming field days event held in Iowa up to that time. Only 100 8010s were built, and 99 of those were rebuilt at the factory and re-released as 8020s in 1960.[6][7] ==1960s: New Generation== John Deere 3020 To introduce its New Generation tractors to all of its dealers in a single day, the company chartered planes to fly more than 5,000 people to Dallas, Texas, on August 30, 1961. Deere put their new tractors on display outside the Cotton Bowl and inside Neiman Marcus. The day would mark the release of a revolutionary line of farm tractors with sleek new styling by Henry Dreyfuss that would soon become the standard all other farm tractors would be measured by. These tractors were the 1010, 2010, 3010 and 4010. These were soon followed by the model 5010 standard introduced in 1962. The 5010 was the first two-wheel drive to exceed 100 hp at the PTO and drawbar. Designed for the western wheatlands, the 5010 was never available as a row crop model. In 1963 the 3010 and 4010 were replaced by the 3020 and 4020. The 4020 is one of the most popular tractors Deere and company has ever made. The year 1965 brought the 5020 standard, which was the industry's most powerful two-wheel-drive model, along with the 1020, 2020, and 54 hp model 2510. By 1966 Sales of the 4020 accounted for 48% of all John Deere tractor sales. Also that year the row crop version of the 5020 was introduced. In the late 1960s John Deere pioneered the roll- over protection structure to protect the farmer from injury in the event of a tractor roll-over. John Deere invited the competition to view a demonstration of its new Roll-Guard. Deere recommended that all tractors include this safety feature and offered to share its design and test data with its competitors. Deere also encouraged farmers to retro-fit their tractors with this safety feature, and offered Roll Guards at cost to farmers who wished to install them on their older New Generation tractors. In 1968 nine new models appeared: the 820, 920, 1120, 1520, 2520, 4000, 4520, WA-14, and WA-17. The WA-14 and WA-17 were articulated four-wheel-drive tractors. The 4520 was John Deere's first turbocharged tractor. The 3020 and 4020 were updated with new features, and the 5020 model had a power increase to an industry leading 141 hp. The 4000 was a high horsepower-to-weight tractor, designed to be a \\"runner\\" rather than a \\"lugger\\". The 4000 used the same engine as the popular 4020, but weighed almost 1000 lbs less. According to Deere the 4000 could, in the same amount of time, pull a 4-bottom plow fast enough to cover the same acreage as a 4020 pulling a 5-bottom plow. The John Deere 4000 was also an economy tractor, providing the same horsepower as the 4020 with fewer features and smaller rear axles. ==1970s Generation II== During the 1970s, John Deere introduced 36 new models. In 1972 John Deere introduced the Generation II tractors. Generation II was characterized by the optional Sound Guard body which was the first truly successful integrated tractor cab. This innovative cab was isolated from the tractor by large rubber bushings which dampened vibrations, and the interior was insulated with foam to reduce noise and protect the operator from extreme temperatures outside. A foam pad on the firewall and sheets of lead under the dash greatly reduced engine noise inside the cab. The Sound Guard body also featured a rounded front windshield with an integrated door. The door post was in line with the exhaust and air intake pipes pipe through the hood for the best forward visibility possible. Fully integrated heating and air conditioning was standard equipment, and it also featured windshield wipers, a dome light, a red interior lamp to illuminate the gear shift levers and hydraulic controls during nighttime operation, and speakers for an optional AM/FM radio which many farmers added because they found the cab so quiet they could actually hear it. When it was introduced it was the quietest tractor cab in the industry and a vast improvement over the aftermarket cabs that John Deere had previously retrofitted to its tractors. The Generation II tractors also offered other innovative features not available on previous Deere models such as a Quad Range transmission that improved on Deere's proven Synchro Range transmission by adding a high and low gears in each range, and Deere's new Perma-Clutch, a wet clutch that would last much longer - virtually the life of the tractor. *1970 the 116 hp 4320, the 135 hp 4620, and 146 hp 7020 were introduced. *1970 in Argentina, introduced the local-made 20 series, with the 1420,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john- deere-1420.html 2420,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john- deere-2420.html 3420http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/12/john- deere-3420.html and 4420.http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john-deere-4420.html *1971 the 60 hp 2030, the 175 hp 6030, and 7520 (also at 175 hp) were added. *1972, On Saturday August 19, John Deere dealers held an open house to usher in their 'Generation 2' tractors. The four new tractors were the 80-HPhp 4030, 100 hp 4230, 125 hp 4430 and 150 hp 4630. There were billed as \\"Sound Idea\\" tractors because of their innovative Sound Guard Body operators enclosure. *1973 would see the final New generation utility tractors launched, - the 35 hp 830, 45 hp 1530 and 70 hp 2630. *1974 the first two models in the Generation 2 four-wheel drive range appeared in 1974 in the 215 hp 8430 and 275 hp 8630. *1975 in Argentina, the 30 series was launched with the 2330,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/01/john-deere-2330.html 2530,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/01/john-deere-2530.html 2730,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/john-deere-2730.html 3330,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/10/john-deere-3330.html 3530http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/john-deere-3530.html and 4530. *1975 the initial Generation 2 utility tractors were introduced. These were the 40 hp 2040, 50 hp 2240, 60 hp 2440 and 70 hp 2640. *In late 1976 a new 80 hp addition as the 2840. *1977 saw what came to be known as \\"Seven in '77.\\" The company's first compact diesels, the \\"Task Master\\" tractors, were introduced in the 22 hp 850 and 27 hp 950. Other than that, the big news was what John Deere called \\"The New Iron Horses\\" with more horses and more iron. These were the 90 hp 4040, 110 hp 4240, 130 hp 4440, 156 hp 4640, and the 180 hp 4840, which replaced the 6030. The \\"Iron Horses\\" featured an improved Sound Guard Body with more sound proofing, hydraulic seat suspension and Deere's Personal Posture seat as standard equipment. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new engine. *1978 brought the 215 hp 8440 and 275 hp 8640 articulated four wheel drive tractors. *1979, late in year a third diesel compact was added, the 33 hp 1050. It had a turbo diesel engine which was unique in its class. Five new utility tractors were added at the same time, the 41 hp 2040, 50 hp 2240, 60 hp 2440, 70 hp 2640 and 81 hp 2940. These five new models had a black and yellow \\"tiger stripe\\" on both sides of the hood. *1979 was the first year for the 40 series in Argentina, because the first model are the John Deere 3440, and continues in the 80's with the 2140, 3140 / 3140 DT, 3540. ==1980s== John Deere introduced at least 38 new tractors during the 1980s during a time when at least 3 other competitors merged, were sold or went out of business altogether: * Two new small compact diesel tractors were added in 1981. These were the 14.5 PTO hp 650 and 18 PTO hp 750. Three new 4WDs came to market in the fall of 1981. These were the 225 hp 8450, 290 hp 8650, and big 370 hp 8850. The 8850 came with the company's biggest engine, the 955-cubic-inch V-8. * Besides the 8850 the JD844 wheel loader and 990 hydraulic excavator were the only other John Deere products to get this V-8. Also according to Wayne Broehl's 1984 book, about the John Deere's Company, a larger 4WD tractor than the 8850 was supposed to appear but never did. * In 1982 11 new 50 series tractors from 40 up to 192.99 hp debuted. The 40 hp 1250, 45 hp 2150, 55 hp 2350, 65 hp 2550, 75 hp 2750, 85 hp 2950, 100 hp 4050, 120 hp 4250, 140 hp 4450, 165 hp 4650 and 192.99 hp 4850. From the 2150 to the 4850 got another industry leading innovation in the use of Castor Action mechanical front-wheel drive which provided 20 percent more pulling power. Like the front tires of a motor grader this Castor/Action Mechanical Front Wheel Drive (MFWD) had the front tires lean to give a shorter turning radius. Deere's 50 series tractors also offered a new power shift transmission with 15 operating speeds. When tested in Nebraska the 4850 was the most fuel efficient tractor ever tested over 60 hp. * The following year 1983 brought in the final two 50 Series tractors namely the 50 hp 1450 and 60 hp 1650. When tested in Nebraska the 1650 proved to be the most fuel efficient tractor ever tested. A 4020 shadow namely the 95 hp 3150 came about in 1985. This was the first John Deere row crop tractor to have MFWD as standard equipment. * Three new diesel compacts came to light in 1986. These were the 16 hp 655, 20 hp 755, 24 hp 855 and 900HC. The 900HC was offset like the 2-cylinder M and was for niche markets. The 655, 755 and 855 all had a hydrostatic drive transmission. The 2355, 2555, 2755 and 2955 were featured as price fighter (Economy) tractors in 1986 with less features. * The following year 1987 John Deere brought out six new models in the 45 hp 2155, 55 hp 2355, 65 hp 2555, 75 hp 2755, 85 hp 2955, and 96 hp 3155. * In an October 1988 at the dealer meeting in Denver, Colorado the new 235 hp 8560, 300 hp 8760, and 370 hp 8960 were introduced. * In early 1989 in Palm Springs, California six new 55 Series tractors were shown to dealers. These were the 105 hp 4055, 120 hp 4255, 140 hp 4455, 156 hp 4555, 177 hp 4755, and 202 hp 4955. The 4555 was an entirely new model which was the same size as the 4640. * This year also brought the 70 Series gear driven compact diesels. These were the 18 hp 670, 24 hp 770, 28 hp 870, 33 hp 970, and 38 hp 1070. ==1990s and generation 3== * In 1990 a new hydrostatic compact utility tractor was introduced: the 955 with a diesel 33 hp three-cylinder engine. ===5000 series=== In some industry watchers were calling Generation 3 the year 1991 brought a glimpse of what John Deere tractors of the 1990s would be like. Eight new tractors were introduced in 1991 starting with the three 5000 Series tractors. These were the 40 hp 5200, 50 hp 5300, and 60 hp 5400. A new model the 92 hp 3055, and 100 hp 3255 followed. John Deere is manufacturing 5000 series of tractors from Sanaswadi, Pune in India, range of products from India are listed below. Additionally, the paint schemes changed in 2007. In 2007, Deere made some HP rating changes in otherwise unchanged machines. The 5103 came with a black engine and drive line prior to 2007 when they began painting the engine area all green. These are referred to as black belly's or green bellies.

An Advantage Series 30 hp 790 compact diesel tractor was added to round things out. ===T tracked versions=== During the fall of 1998 John Deere had a 360 hp prototype 9300T track tractor at at least three farm shows. During August 1999 the company had another dealer meeting in Moline, Illinois. It was here that the 360 hp 9300T and 425 hp 9400T were revealed to their dealers.

The company had another dealer meeting in late July 2008 to introduce many new utility tractors. But the real announcement came with John Deere introduced a new Worldwide Numbering Scheme for the Entire Line up of Compact and AG Tractors. ===Power ratings / model numbers=== From the 2008 model range on the Engine horsepower will now be advertised in metric (ISO) per the International Organization for Standardization 97/68/EC standard for determining bare engine horsepower at rated engine power in the Model name. *The First digit will determine size, *The next Three will determine engine horsepower, *A new letter will be added (currently D, E, or M) to determine spec level. **R being a high spec machine (like the Premium series in the 6000 and 7000 series) the **M to denote a mid spec and **E/D to denote a low-spec (\\"value spec\\") (like the 03 and 05 series in the 6000 and 5000 respectively). *A sixth digit describes special configurations (like \\"T\\" for Tracks on the 8RT series tractors) Example For example, the new 3032E Tractor will be a 3000 with 32 hp on engine. The E is low-spec. This tractor represents the 2007 year 3203 for its spec, not to be mistaken for the 3320 which has the same hp but more features and at a higher price. Over the next few years all Tractors will get this scheme. The issue is that Deere is using Engine hp in the Name, not PTO which is usually less. ===2008 Models=== In 2008, the first Tractors to get this scheme were the 5D, 5E, 5E Limited edition and the 6D Series tractors. These tractors were introduced at the annual John Deere dealer meeting. This year's event was held in Denver, Colorado. *5D - range of the 45 hp 5045D, and 55 hp 5055D. The PTO ratings are 37 and 45 respectively. The 5D tractors are only available in two-wheel drive. *5E -range of the 45 hp 5045E, 55 hp 5055E, 65 hp 5065E, and 75 hp 5075E. The PTO hp ratings are the 37, 45, 53, and 61 respectively. The 5E Limited come with MFWD-mechanical front-wheel drive. *5E Limited tractors which are the 83 hp 5083E, 93 hp 5093E, and 101 hp 5101E. The PTO hp ratings are 65,75 and 82 respectively. The 5E tractor are available in both 2-wheel drive and MFWD versions. The biggest tractors in the new range were the 100-140 hp 6D models. *6D - range of the 100 hp 6100D, 115 hp 6115D, 130 hp 6130D, and 140 hp 6140D. PTO hp for the 4 models are 82, 95, 105 and 115 respectively. The 6D is offered in 2WD and MFWD versions. According to Deere.com the company introduced two new 3E Series tractors. This pair of new 3E Series tractors is on page two of The Furrow, December 2008 edition. Both new 3E models would appear in early October 2008. These would be the 31/25 hp 3032E and 37/30 hp 3038E.

The 8225R is the only one available as a two-wheel- drive model. Optional IVT or Powershift Transmissions. In John Deere language the first number=size, the next three numbers are the engine hp and the letter at the end stands for capability. The six tractors range from 225 to 345 hp with the 8345R being the most powerful row crop model on the market. Also shown to the dealers were the new 8RT rubber track tractor models. These three models are the 295 hp 8295RT, 320 hp 8320RT and the 345 hp 8345RT. The T at the end stands for tracks. Other than that the numbers in the 8RT Series are the same in their 8R counterparts.

Two other lesser known tractors were also introduced by the company are the 5105ML orchard and poultry tractors. The hp is 105 engine and 90 PTO. One version of the 5105ML comes configured to work in orchards and vineyards, while the other version is a low-profile tractor to work in poultry barns. In August 2010 John Deere had another dealer meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio to introduce still more tractors.

These new models are 2011 year tractors with several improvements. new 8295 R 2017 build These would be the 8R/8RT Series tractors. These would be the 8235R, 8260R, 8285R, 8310R, 8335R and 8360R wheel tractors ranging from 235 to 360 engine horsepower. The PTO is 192, 213, 234, 25, 276 and 296 hp for the six tractors. Besides the six wheel tractors, three new 8RT track tractors would be added too. There would be the 310-360 engine hp 8310RT. 8335RT and the 8360RT. Power-take off horsepower for is 247, 268 and 288 respectively. One of the major changes with these nine green-and-yellow tractors was the new PowerTech PSX 548-cubic-inch dual turbocharged diesel. This is an Interim Tier 4 (IT4) diesel engine. On January 1, 2011 EPA Tier 4 regulations will begin thus the new PowerTech diesel in these tractors. Despite their competitors going with SCR to counter this John Deere will be using EGR-Exhaust Gas Recirculation. To tell these new 8R tractors apart from the 2010 tractors John Deere put new wrap-around lights up front. Also the model number has been moved close to the front just off the black grill on both sides .Another characteristic is the new large black muffler on the right corner of the cab. Other improvements engineered into these tractors are JDLink, ActiveCommand Steering (ACS), Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT) AutoMode, GS3 CommandCenter and the StarFire 3000 Receiver.

Referral agents include physicians, mental health professionals, other health care facilities, community agencies, courts, corrections, police, and family, in addition to self-referral.

Interdisciplinary teams are made up of program managers, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychometrists, nurses, psychiatric aides, social workers, occupational therapists, recreation therapists, physiotherapists, therapy assistants, counselors, pharmacists, dietitians, chaplains and support staff. ==HistoryGrand Opening=== *Opened Sunday, July 1, 1923, as the \\"Provincial Mental Institute, Oliver\\". For many years, it was a World War I veterans hospital. The first 47 patients arrived in the summer of 1923 from the \\"Hospital for Returned Soldiers\\" (later known as Michener Centre) in Red Deer. All 47 patients were veterans of World War I who were mostly suffering from \\"shell shock,\\" now known as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The first physician caring for these veterans was Captain Dr. David L. Dick. He served with the Royal Army Medical Corps 142nd Field Ambulance in 1915-16 on the Western Front. In 1917, he was transferred to the Canadian Expeditionary Force and became Resident Medical Officer for the Strathcona Military Hospital, Edmonton. The Grand Opening was a significant event as these were veterans and the official hostess of the occasion was Bridget Velma Henderson, niece of Premier Herbert Greenfield, who later married WW I flying ace Stanley A. Puffer of the Royal Flying Corps. At the Grand Opening, luminaries in attendance included: **Dick Reid. the Minister of Health **Archie Matheson, the MLA from Vegreville **John Edward Brownlee, the Attorney-General ===Recent History=== In August 2009 Alberta Health Services announced that it will be closing 106 of the 410 beds at the hospital. The AUPE has been strongly opposed to the closures and have staged many protests and have made several television commercials at an attempt to gain support. ==Buildings== There are 45 buildings at AHE spread over .Abercrombie, Sheila.

This first systematic synthesis of French civil law abandoned the structure of the Code civil. It introduced, among others, German legal notions such as rules of evidence as well as theories of joint property and vindication to French law. Originally a translation of Karl-Salomon Zachariä's Handbuch des französischen Civilrechts, the work became increasingly independent from its German template, being republished as late as 1964–73 in an incomplete 7th edition. ==References== * Category:French jurists Category:1803 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Court of Cassation (France) judges Category:19th-century French judges Category:19th-century jurists ","title":"Charles Aubry"},{"id":"9084983","text":"Euphoria () is a 2006 Russian drama/romance film directed by dramatist and director Ivan Vyrypayev, most recently acclaimed as a co-screenwriter of Bumer 2.

In the same year Euphoria won the Kinotavr Special Prize of the Jury. At the Russian Film Festival past autumn 2007 in the United Kingdom it was appreciated also, became one of the most successful festival films. The movie stars include young and not yet widely known Russian actors such as Polina Agureeva and Mikhail Okunev. Directed by Ivan Vyrypayev, who has attracted considerable local and international acclaim for his plays (including \\"Oxygen\\" staged in more than 20 countries). ==Plot== The story unfolds in the Eurasian Steppes. Vera lives with her husband Valery and their daughter in a house on the outskirts; at someone else's wedding she meets Pavel. They become instantly attracted to each other. The film begins with a scene of quarrel between Pavel and his friend, during which Pavel decides to go to Vera by all means, regardless of her husband. The two meet in the steppe, but dialogue does not work between them. Vera returns home where a misfortune occurs: a domestic dog bites her daughter by the finger. While the mother in a panic runs for help to the neighbors, Valery cuts off the wounded finger, gives the daughter vodka and kills the dog. At night, Vera goes to the steppe to bury the animal, where she encounters Pavel: he still wanders around their house. Together they bury the dog's corpse. Vera returns and finds that her daughter feels worse and that her neighbors took her to the nearest hospital. Valery is asleep, having got drunk from vodka. Together with Valery, Vera runs to the bank of the river where they see Pavel's motor boat. He agrees to take them by the waterway to the hospital. During the trip Valery notes that Vera's dress is all soiled in the mud, and strikes her hard against the side of the boat. Pavel immediately stops the boat at the shore, throws Valery out of the boat and together with Vera steers away. Valery returns home, takes a rifle and ammunition, sets fire to the hut and goes out to find them. Meanwhile, Vera and Pavel become lovers. In the hospital, they do not find her daughter: it turns out that the neighbors have already taken her back home. Pavel offers Vera to take her daughter and stay with him. In the meantime Valery having gotten drunk from vodka, kills a cow on the field to see if he is able to kill a living being, and then sits on the shore in anticipation of Pavel's boat. The couple appears soon. Valery slays Pavel in several shots and injures Vera. Pavel protects the woman using his body as a shield and together they sail in the blood-filled boat with the still living Vera, before it begins to sink from the bullet holes. ==Reception== * * * ==References* Category:2006 films Category:Russian films Category:2006 romantic drama films Category:Russian romantic drama films Category:2006 drama films ","title":"Euphoria (2006 film)"},{"id":"9084994","text":"New York State Route 4 may refer to: *New York State Route 4 (1924–1927) in the Finger Lakes region *U.S. Route 4 in New York, the only route numbered \\"4\\" in New York since 1926 ","title":"New York State Route 4"},{"id":"9085037","text":"Andy Lewis may refer to: *Andy Lewis (performer) (born 1986), American highliner and trickliner also known as Sketchy Andy *Andy Lewis (bassist) (1967–2000), original bass guitarist with Australian group The Whitlams *Andy Lewis (producer), English soul producer, best known for the album Billion Pound Project and his collaboration single with Paul Weller *Andy Lewis (screenwriter) (1925–2018), American Academy Award-nominated screenwriter, best known for working on Klute *Andy Lewis, guitarist of the Canadian Boys Night Out *Andy Lewis (cricketer) (born 1976), English cricketer *Andy Lewis (triathlete) (born 1983), British paratriathlete ==See also== *Andrew Lewis (disambiguation) ","title":"Andy Lewis"},{"id":"9085050","text":"Barris performs \\"Music Has Charms\\" in 1932 Harry Barris (November 24, 1905 – December 13, 1962) was an American popular singer and songwriter, and is one of the earliest singers to use \\"scat singing\\" in recordings. Barris, one of Paul Whiteman's Rhythm Boys, along with Bing Crosby and Al Rinker, scatted on several songs, including \\"Mississippi Mud,\\" which Barris wrote in 1927. ==Biography== Barris was born to Jewish parents in New York City. Gary Giddins described him as \\"small, wiry, and moon-faced with glittery eyes, and dark hair slicked back and parted in the middle.\\" He was educated in Denver, Colorado. Barris became a professional pianist at the age of 14. He led a band which toured the Far East at the age of 17. Barris married Hazelle Thompson in 1925 and they had a daughter, Hazelle Barris, in 1926. The same year, Barris played the piano and occasionally sang in Paul Ash's orchestra. In the same year, Al Rinker and Bing Crosby became members of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra as a singing duo. However, appearing at the vast New York Paramount in February 1927, where there were no microphones, they could not be heard by the audience. They were promptly dropped from the bill. However, a band member who knew Barris suggested that they add him to make a trio and The Rhythm Boys were formed in April 1927. In 1930, Barris divorced Hazelle Thompson. The Rhythm Boys left Paul Whiteman the same year and joined Gus Arnheim's Cocoanut Grove Orchestra. They made one more recording together, \\"Them There Eyes\\" (November 20, 1930), but the boys decided to quit in May 1931 and they went their separate ways. However, Barris changed his mind and returned to the Cocoanut Grove to complete his contract. Barris joined Arnheim's singing group The Three Ambassadors. Barris met Loyce Whiteman, who also sang with the Orchestra, and married her in 1931. They appear together in an episode of Rambling 'Round Radio Row. They had one daughter, Marti Barris, who also became a musician. They divorced in 1946. Barris appeared in 57 films between 1931 and 1950, usually as a band member, pianist and/or singer. Seven of those films had Bing Crosby as the star. In 1932, Barris signed a contract to star in six shorts for Educational Pictures, similar to Bing Crosby's launch into films. The first of these shorts was That Rascal. In The Lost Weekend (1945), he is the nightclub pianist who humiliates Ray Milland by singing \\"Somebody Stole My Purse\\". An unusual change of pace for Barris was his comedy role in The Fleet's In (1942), as a runty sailor named Pee Wee who perpetrates malapropisms in a surprisingly deep voice. During World War II, Barris, along with Joe E. Brown, went overseas to entertain troops. Barris had a lifelong drinking problem. In a fall, he fractured his hip in March 1961. Despite a series of operations, he developed a cancerous tumor. He died in Burbank, California, aged 57. His composition \\"Never Been So Lost\\" was published shortly before his death. ==Compositions== # \\"Hong Kong Dream Girl\\" (1924), with George E.

In English texts he is usually named simply El Hiba. He was the son of Ma al-'Aynayn, a religious leader of the Sahara. His father was appointed caid of Tindouf in 1887, by the Moroccan sultan Hassan I. Ma al-'Aynayn led an armed uprising against the French in the first decade of the twentieth century, and died in 1910 in Tiznit. Shortly after his death, in 1912 the French imposed the Treaty of Fez on the Moroccans and took virtual control of the country. Ma al-'Aynayn's son al-Hiba then decided that this effectively vacated the position of Sultan of Morocco, and proclaimed himself Sultan at Tiznit (Morocco) as his father had done before him. A general uprising in the south of Morocco saw al-Hiba recognized as Sultan in Taroudannt, Agadir and the Dades and Draa regions. He gained a powerful ally in Si Madani, head of the Glaoua family. With his tribal army he entered Marrakech on 18 August 1912 and was proclaimed Sultan there also. The decisive Battle of Sidi Bou Othman with the French took place near Marrakech on 6 September 1912. al-Hiba's forces were defeated by the French commanded by Charles Mangin, with the loss of some 2000 tribal warriors. In January 1913, the Glaoua family, now allied with the French, drove al-Hiba back to the Sous. al-Hiba did not give up the struggle and continued to harass the French in his own area until his death on 23 June 1919 in Kerdous Anti-Atlas. Since then his struggle was carried on by his brother Merebbi Rebbu. ==References== José Ramón Diego Aguirre, El Oscuro Pasado del Desierto. Approximación a la Historia del Sáhara.

Rectisol is used most often to treat synthesis gas (primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide) produced by gasification of coal or heavy hydrocarbons, as the methanol solvent is well able to remove trace contaminants such as ammonia, mercury, and hydrogen cyanide usually found in these gases. As an acid gas and large component of valuable feed gas streams, CO2 is separated during the methanol solvent regeneration. ==Process description== In the Rectisol process (licensed by both Linde AG and Air Liquide's Lurgi division), cold methanol at approximately –40 °F (–40 °C) dissolves (absorbs) the acid gases from the feed gas at relatively high pressure, usually 400 to 1000 psia (2.76 to 6.89 MPa). The rich solvent containing the acid gases is then let down in pressure to release and recover the acid gases. The Rectisol process can operate selectively to recover hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide as separate streams, so that the hydrogen sulfide can be sent to either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulfur or a WSA Process unit to recover sulfuric acid, while at the same time the carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery. Rectisol, like Selexol and Purisol, is a physical solvent, unlike amine based acid gas removal solvents that rely on a chemical reaction with the acid gases. Methanol as a solvent is inexpensive compared to the proprietary Selexol and Purisol solvents. The Rectisol process requires more electrical energy for refrigeration to maintain the low temperatures required but it also requires less steam energy for regeneration. Although capital costs for methanol solvent (Rectisol) units are higher than proprietary solvent units, methanol as a cold, physical solvent can remove greater percentages of acid gas components providing a higher purity cleaned gas. The Rectisol process is very flexible and can be configured to address the separation of synthesis gas into various components, depending on the final products that are desired from the gas. It is very suitable to complex schemes where a combination of products are needed, such as for example hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia and methanol synthesis gases and fuel gas side streams.“Process Screening Analysis of Alternative Gas Treating and Sulfur Removal for Gasification” Revised Final Report; December 2002; Nick Korens, Dale R.

They were craftsmen and often self-employed. They are known specifically for writing poems in the common tongue of the time for that region, Scots. More often than not, they were working-class and not formally educated. Some of the more well-known Weaver Poets were James Orr of Ballycarry and David Herbison - The Bard of Dunclug. ==Style and form== The style they adopted was the standard Habbie as adopted from a Robert Sempill poem by Robert Fergusson, himself a Scottish weaver, and later by Burns. Sometimes the poetry produced by the movement was political - Orr had joined the United Irishmen in 1791 and took part in the United Irishmen Rebellion of 1798. Many weaver poems were collected by poet John Hewitt.

The team was coached by Mack Brown. The Longhorns played their home games in Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium (DKR). The Longhorns entered the 2007 season ranked third on all-time college football lists in both total wins and winning percentage. A pre-season ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the Longhorns ranked eighth, while College Football News ranked Texas third. The Longhorns came into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll. During the preceding summer five players had been disciplined for legal infractions, another suspended for NCAA rule violations, and a coach had undergone surgery for cancer. Additional players were suspended during the season. The Longhorns played games against two opponents they had never faced previously: Arkansas State University and the University of Central Florida (UCF). The Longhorns narrowly achieved a victory in their home opener with Arkansas State, and in their first road game of the season, Texas was the inaugural opponent for the UCF Knights in their new stadium. In preseason speculation, games against Texas Christian University (TCU) and Oklahoma (OU) were considered among the top 20 games to watch during the 2007 college football season. The 2007 Longhorns take the field on opening day against Arkansas State. The Longhorns lost conference games to the Kansas State Wildcats, the Oklahoma Sooners, and the Texas A&M; Aggies. In two close games, they avoided upset attempts by lower-ranked Nebraska and Oklahoma State, the latter game involving a 21-point fourth quarter comeback by the Horns. Texas concluded its season by winning the 2007 Holiday Bowl against the Arizona State Sun Devils—another first-time opponent for Texas—bringing their season record to 10–3. The Horns finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll and in the USA Today coaches poll. After the season, five UT players entered professional football through the 2008 NFL Draft and four others agreed to sign free-agent contracts with NFL teams. ==Before the 2007 season== Mack Brown became the head coach of the Texas Longhorns for the 1998 season. Through 2006, he had a win/loss record of 93–22 and the best winning percentage (80.9%) of any football coach in Longhorn history. The 2004 team had the first Bowl Championship Series win for any Texas team and the 2005 team won the National Championship (the fourth for the UT football program). The 2006 team had 9 wins and 1 loss through November 4, 2006 but starting quarterback Colt McCoy was injured in the 11th game and Texas lost the final two regular season games, including a 12–7 home loss to division rivals Texas A&M.; This took the team out of contention for the conference championship, as well as the national championship. Between the 2006 regular season and the bowl season, back-up quarterback Jevan Snead transferred to another school, and Longhorn defensive coordinator Gene Chizik accepted the head-coaching job at Iowa State University. The Longhorns ended up accepting a bowl invitation to the Alamo Bowl against the unranked University of Iowa Hawkeyes, who had finished in eighth place in the Big Ten Conference. Colt McCoy was cleared to play for the Horns and led Texas through a back-and-forth affair to a 26–24 win. The Longhorns finished the season with a record of 10 wins and 3 losses and received a final ranking of 13th in the nation by both the Associated Press AP Poll and the USA Today Coaches Poll Texas entered the 2007 season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage. They were ranked in the Top 10 by numerous pre- season polls. For instance, a pre-season ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the Longhorns ranked eighth; Rivals.com ranked them ninth; College Football News and Real Football 365 both ranked Texas third. The Longhorns came into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll. ===Facilities and equipment=== The Texas bluebonnet decal honored President Lyndon B. Johnson and his family. Following the final home game of 2006, construction workers demolished the north end of Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. This section was rebuilt to make the lowest seats closer to the field while planning for luxury boxes and an upper-deck. The lower deck was ready for 2007, while the upper deck and luxury boxes are planned to be ready for 2008. The modifications put the north end zone seats thirty yards closer to the field of play. This results in several game day changes, such as Smokey the Cannon moving to the south end-zone near Bevo. Each 2007 Longhorn football helmet featured a Texas bluebonnet decal. The decal was chosen to honor President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson and the Johnson family. Brown said President Johnson used to enjoy discussing football with former UT coach Darrell K Royal, while the first lady was known for her conservation efforts, particularly the spread of native wildflowers. For the second straight year, Utah merchandise products were the top-selling products among clients of Collegiate Licensing Company. UT entered into a marketing arrangement with Bluetooth SIG to deploy Bluetooth kiosks throughout the stadium. These kiosks broadcast free game-day information to Bluetooth-enabled cell-phones in the stands. ===Practices and preseason injuries=== The Godzillatron scoreboard at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, home of the Longhorns, with the Austin skyline in the background (2006). The Longhorns played their 2007 Spring Jamboree Scrimmage on March 31, 2007 and reported for fall practice on August 5, 2007. A public scrimmage scheduled for August 18, 2007 was canceled due to safety concerns related to the weather and to ongoing stadium construction. With rain expected over the weekend and no working pumps to help remove water from the field, Brown held a closed practice indoors instead. During fall practice, receivers Limas Sweed, Billy Pittman, and Jordan Shipley were injured. Sweed suffered a sprain to his left wrist on August 15. Pittman sprained his left shoulder during practice on August 17. Head UT athletic trainer Kenny Boyd said, \\"We will continue to evaluate [Pittman] and monitor his progress in hopes of getting him back in time for the season opener.\\" Jordan Shipley had to limit his practice due to a strained hamstring. The receiver position was considered one of the deepest positions on the team; coaches said veteran players Quan Cosby (Texas' second-leading receiver) and Nate Jones performed well in training camp. Coach Brown said he expected to be able to play three freshman receivers in 2007: Brandon Collins, Malcolm Williams and James Kirkendoll. On August 29, 2006 Brown announced that Sweed was \\"probable\\" for the season opening game, but that Shipley was \\"doubtful\\". ===Coaches=== Duane Akina (center), Texas defensive coordinator Prior to the first game of the season, the University of Texas Board of Regents voted unanimously to raise Brown's salary by $300,000, bringing his annual compensation to $2.81 million and keeping him among the five highest- paid coaches in college football. The package also includes up to $3 million in bonuses, including \\"$100,000 if he wins the Big 12 Championship and $450,000 for a national championship, as well as bonuses based on the percent of players who graduate.\\" At the time, Brown's contract extended through the 2016 season and included buy-out clauses should another school attempt to hire Brown. Greg Davis, who entered his 10th season with Texas, was the team's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Duane Akina was the defensive coordinator, and took the position vacated by Gene Chizik when he left the program. During the 2007 season, Akina performed his job on the sidelines while Larry Mac Duff provided input from the press box. UT running backs coach Ken Rucker announced in August that he had prostate cancer and that he would have surgery on August 27. He coached practices until just prior to surgery and returned to the team before the end of the season. Rucker's health concern coincided with player incidents that created Brown's most tumultuous off- season since arriving at Texas. ===Player suspensions=== Sergio Kindle (left) and Chris Caflisch signing autographs for children from the Warm Springs Rehabilitation Center in San Antonio. The school suspended a total of seven players for at least a portion of the season. Six were suspended for alleged illegal activities, and one was suspended for a violation of National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) rules. Defensive end Henry Melton and linebacker Sergio Kindle were both arrested during the summer on charges of driving while intoxicated. Freshman defensive tackle Andre (Dre) Jones (who had not yet played for Texas but did join spring practices) and former UT player Robert Joseph were charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Jones was one of the team's most highly touted recruits; his high school football career honors included Prep All-American, three-time all-state selection, first-team All-American by Parade Magazine, and Texas 4A Defensive Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association The university suspended Tyrell Gatewood indefinitely after he was arrested on two drug possession charges. James Henry was arrested on third-degree felony charges of \\"obstruction or retaliation and tampering or fabricating physical evidence.\\" The University of Texas suspended Billy Pittman for three games because he violated NCAA rules when he accepted the use of a friend's car over the summer. Coach Brown and University of Texas President William Charles Powers Jr. issued statements concerning the importance of team discipline and zero tolerance policy for infractions. ==Schedule== ==PlayersRoster=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%;\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"(as of August 5, 2007) - valign=\\"top\\" Quarterbacks * 7 John Chiles -Fr.-HS * 11 G.J.

Of their picks for the top 100 incoming freshman, Texas signed #8 Tray Allan (offensive lineman), #14 Curtis Brown (cornerback), #30 Andre (Dre) Jones (defensive tackle), #31 John Chiles (wide receiver), and #81 Russell Carter (defensive end). Carter made the preseason roster as a defensive end while Chiles was listed as a quarterback. Jones was suspended from the team due to legal trouble. ==Game summariesArkansas State=== Running back Antwan Cobb backs into the end zone for a touchdown on a 16-yard pass from Colt McCoy. The first Longhorn game of the season marked the first-ever meeting between Texas and Arkansas State, an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision team from the Sun Belt Conference. Pre- game media attention played upon the fact that both schools won national football championships in 1970. Both schools entered the game with a level of controversy attached to their teams. Arkansas State was facing criticism over its team name. The team was nicknamed \\"Indians\\" in honor of the Osage Nation that inhabited the area until the 1800s. The NCAA enforced restrictions on the use of Indian mascots, saying that they were derogatory to American Indians. In 2008, the Indians changed their name to the Red Wolves. The University of Texas was dealing with player suspensions, and passed a large pay raise for Mack Brown one week prior to the game. As part of the package, Brown received a $100,000 special payment upon completion of the game. Two days prior to the game, Las Vegas casinos favored Texas by 39points. Sportswriters John Bridges and Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman predicted the Longhorns would have a big lead early in the game and that true-freshman quarterback John Chiles would enter the game in the second or third quarter as the backup to Colt McCoy. Redshirt freshman quarterback Sherrod Harris was on the injured list and was not expected to play. Those predictions were off the mark as the Indians almost kept up with the Horns and McCoy stayed in for the entire game. Texas scored a touchdown on its first possession and Arkansas State answered with a field goal. Texas made another touchdown to end the first quarter. Neither team scored in the second quarter. Texas scored seven points in the third quarter, while Arkansas State was scoreless. In the fourth quarter, Arkansas State scored ten points to pull within eight points of Texas. With approximately one minute left to play, Arkansas State attempted an onside kick. State recovered the ball, but a controversial illegal formation penalty forced them to re-kick. On the re-kick, Texas recovered the ball and was able to run out the clock to preserve a 21–13 win. Colt McCoy threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions; he also made two punts. Jamaal Charles accounted for the third touchdown. The team and fans sing The Eyes of Texas after the victory. Starting Longhorn defensive end Brian Orakpo injured his right knee during the game. The team reported Orakpo did not need surgery but that it was uncertain when he would return. Kirk Bohls was among commentators who were unimpressed by the Longhorns performance, saying, \\"if this becomes the pattern, look for a 7–5 season.\\" On September 5, Arkansas State coach Steve Roberts said he was told by the Big 12 Conference's supervisor of football officials that game officials wrongly overturned ASU's recovery of the onside kick. He said the Big 12 Conference Supervisor of Officials told Arkansas State there had been no illegal formation, that no penalty should have been called, and that Arkansas State should have been awarded possession of the football. A Big 12 Conference spokesman said he could not confirm or deny that such a conversation took place and that any such conversation was confidential. ===TCU=== Texas sideline prior to TCU game The second Longhorn game of the season was the first meeting of the former Southwest Conference (SWC) rivals since the conference disbanded following the 1995 season. Texas held a 60–20–1 (win-lose-tie) record vs. the TCU Horned Frogs. Their most recent meeting was a 27–19 Longhorn victory. In their annual season preview magazine, CBS SportsLine.com selected two Longhorn games — vs. TCU and against OU — as ranking in their 17 \\"must see\\" games for 2007. CBS Sportsline.com also selected TCU as one of the potential \\"BCS Busters\\" for 2007, saying, \\"The Horned Frogs will have one of the best defenses in the nation with nine starters back on a squad that allowed only 12.3 points per game last year, including a 12–3 victory over Texas Tech. Garry Patterson has made the Horned Frogs one of the best BCS non-AQ conference schools in the nation, but unlike Utah and Boise State, they had not received the opportunity to play in a Bowl Championship Series bowl. If TCU can get past Texas on Sept. 8, it might finally be time for the Horned Frogs to invade the BCS party.\\" Texas' narrow win versus Arkansas State in week one, together with TCU's victory over Baylor, fueled speculation that the 2007 Horned Frogs might have a chance at an upset victory over the Longhorns. Texas dropped three places to number seven in the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, while TCU moved up three places to number nineteen. One day prior to the game, Las Vegas casinos picked Texas to win by 9½ points. First scoring drive for Texas Both teams were scoreless in the first quarter. In the second quarter, TCU's Torrey Stewart faked a blitz, then dropped back and caught an interception from Colt McCoy before running in for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, McCoy threw a pass that was tipped by a defender and intercepted by David Roach. The Longhorn defense kept the Horned Frogs out of the end zone following the interception, but the Frogs scored on a 19-yard field goal by Chris Manfredini. The first half ended with TCU leading, 10–0. The Longhorns' first second-half drive culminated in a 33-yard touchdown pass to Nate Jones. A fumble by TCU gave Texas good field position, but the Longhorns were stopped on the two-yard line and settled for a game- tying field goal. The Horns held TCU to seventeen yards of offense and no first downs in the quarter. In the fourt quarter, Colt McCoy set up the go- ahead score with a scramble to the TCU one-yard line. Vondrell McGee scored a touchdown two plays later. Texas' next possession resulted in a second field goal by Ryan Bailey. The Longhorn defense held TCU to a three-and-out but TCU's punter fumbled the ball, and Brandon Foster ran the ball in for a touchdown, capping 27 straight points for Texas. The Frogs came back and scored 37-yard field goal by Manfredini and then attempted an onsides kick but Texas recovered the ball. UT's Jamaal Charles made a 39-yard rushing touchdown for the game's final score. Texas won, 34–13. The attendance for the game, 84,621, was the third-largest crowd ever to watch a TCU football game. ===UCF=== Knights on offense The third game of the season was the first-ever meeting between the Longhorns and the UCF Knights. Texas was the first opponent in the Knights' new stadium, Bright House Networks Stadium, and the game was the first of three scheduled meetings between the schools. The Knights opened their season with an upset of North Carolina State; the victory was their second victory over a BCS opponent and the first time for the Knights to beat a BCS school since 2000. They followed the win with a week off, giving them two weeks to prepare for Texas. It was just the sixth time Texas had played in Florida and was the team's first appearance in the state since 1965. The number six-ranked Longhorns were the highest rank team the Knights had ever played. UCF coach George O'Leary said prior to the game, \\"When you talk about elite teams, Texas is an elite team from an athletics, traditions and overall standpoint.\\" Several Longhorn players missed the game due to injuries or suspensions. Starting defensive end Brian Orakpo missed his second straight game as a result of suffering a knee sprain against Arkansas State. Starting offensive tackle Adam Ulatoski was listed as doubtful. Backup quarterback Sherrod Harris was also injured and had not seen action since spraining his knee on August 12. Wide receiver Jordan Shipley participated in his first game since a preseason injury. Defensive end Henry Melton, linebacker Sergio Kindle and receiver Billy Pittman were serving the last game of their three-game suspensions. On September 13, Tyrell Gatewood joined Andre Jones and Robert Joseph in receiving an indefinite suspension due to alleged illegal activities. The day prior to the game, sports books in Las Vegas picked Texas to win by 18 points. A sell-out crowd greeted the Longhorns in Florida. UCF received the opening kickoff in their end-zone and took a touchback. UCF was not able to get a first down and before punting the ball to Texas. The Horns drove inside the UCF 20-yard line before being stopped on fourth-and-short and settling for a field goal. On their second possession, the Knights drove the ball down the field for a touchdown and a four-point lead. Shortly thereafter, lightning was spotted near the stadium and both teams were sent into their locker rooms for approximately 15 minutes before play resumed. Texas' first drive after the delay culminated in a six-yard touchdown pass to Nate Jones. When the first quarter ended, the Longhorns had a three-point lead and the Knights had the ball. In the second quarter, the Longhorns and the Knights each fumbled inside the UCF ten-yard line. Texas scored ten points in the quarter to UCF's three. The score at halftime was 20–10, Texas. UCF Knights at the Texas goal-line Texas began the scoring in the third quarter with a 49-yard field goal. UCF needed just five plays to reply with a touchdown and cut Texas' lead to 23–17. After two punts by the Horns and one by the Knights, UCF turned the ball over on downs. On the next play, McCoy threw an interception and UCF's resulting drive culminated in a touchdown to give the Knights a 24–23 lead with 13:38 left in the game. The Longhorns regained the lead with two field goals and a touchdown. A Longhorn attempt at a two-point conversion failed, making the score 35–24. This decision was later criticized by commentators who said that the decision allowed UCF a chance to tie the game. With 2:14 remaining, Longhorn Jamaal Charles committed his second fumble of the game. UCF recovered the ball and completed a touchdown and a two-point conversion to cut Texas' lead to 35–32 with 35 seconds remaining. When the Knights were unable to recover their onside kick attempt, Texas was able to run out the clock and preserve a three- point victory. Jamaal Charles of Texas rushed 22 times for 157 yards and Kevin Smith of UCF rushed 27 times for 150 yards for UCF. McCoy completed 68% of his passes for a total of 227 yards; UCF's Kyle Israel completed 35% of his passes for a total of 133 yards. McCoy's 47 passing attempts tied a UT single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. Due to his performance in the game, Texas cornerback Brandon Foster was named the Big 12's defensive player of the week. For the second week in a row, Foster scored a touchdown on defense. Foster was recognized by the conference the previous week for his work on special teams, making him the first Longhorn to get back-to-back conference honors since running back Hodges Mitchell in 2000. Kicker Ryan Bailey tied a school record with five field goals. Combined with his previous attempts, the five kicks made him seven-of- nine for the season at that point. Bright House Networks Stadium during the pre-game festivities ===Rice=== Prior to the 2007 season, Texas and Rice had competed in football on 89 prior occasions. The series, which began in 1914, is the fourth oldest (by number of games) in Texas history. The Owls were 21-67-1 against Texas heading into the game, including the sixth-longest streak of one college football team winning over another team. After their narrow victory over the UCF Knights, the Longhorns remained in sixth place in the coaches’ poll and dropped from sixth to seventh place in the Associated Press poll. Jeff Sagarin, whose computer rankings are used as a component of the Bowl Championship Series rankings, had the Longhorns at number twelve coming into the game. Sagarin's system had Rice ranked as the worst team in Division I-A and 181st in the country, behind many I-AA teams. Four days prior to the game, Las Vegas favored UT by 39 points. The Longhorns suspended special teams player James Henry prior to the game, but three Longhorn players—Billy Pittman, Henry Melton, and Sergio Kindle—were able to rejoin the team after serving three game suspensions. Brian Orakpo missed his third straight game due to an injury received in the season-opening game. The Owls came into the game 0–3 after losing the previous week to Texas Tech by a score of 59–24. The Longhorns started the game on offense and had no success on their first drive. On the first play, Colt McCoy threw an incompletion, and on the second play, Jamaal Charles fumbled the ball to the Owls. The Texas defense held Rice to a field goal attempt, which was no good. Texas scored a touchdown on a 13-play drive that included converting a 4th-and-two situation. The Longhorns extended their lead to 41–0 before Rice scored a touchdown with 18 seconds left in the first half. In the second half, Texas scored two touchdowns and one field goal, and Rice scored one touchdown. Texas won 58–14. The Longhorn band performs March Grandioso at the game. McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For the first time in the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first appearance as a Texas player in the first quarter, when he participated in a single play. He came out of the game after the play before returning in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On his first drive, Chiles led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball 4 times for 49 yards. He also threw one incomplete pass (one of two he threw in the game) and handed off to Vondrell McGee three times for thirty-one yards. Redshirt freshman Sherrod Harris replaced Chiles for the final two drives of the game. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how the Longhorns could get him more playing time. McGee was the game's leading rusher, and had 8 carries for 80 yards. Jamaal Charles rushed 14 times for 72 yards, and John Chiles ran 9 times for 72 yards. Limas Sweed was the leading receiver with 5 catches for 139 yards and 2 touchdowns as he set a new career high for receiving yards in a single game. Sergio Kindle injured his knee, and defensive end Eddie Jones injured his shoulder, but neither injury was thought to be serious. Pre-game festivities at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium prior to the Rice game ===Kansas State=== McCoy drops back to pass Texas first played Kansas State in 1913 and held a record of 5–4–0 in the series prior to 2007. Since the Kansas State Wildcats belong to the north division of the Big 12 Conference, Texas plays KSU two out of every four years. In the 2006 meeting, fourth-ranked Texas was favored by 16 points over an unranked Kansas State team; Colt McCoy was injured early in the game and KSU went on to defeat Texas 45–42. This defeat snapped the Longhorns 17 win streak on the road as well as the national-best 21-game conference winning steak. One day prior to the 200 game, Las Vegas casinos picked Texas to win by 15 points. Kansas State got the ball to start the game and scored a touchdown on their opening drive. Texas answered with a touchdown on a drive that featured backup quarterback John Chiles in the game alongside Colt McCoy for some of the plays. The first quarter ended with the score tied 7–7. In the second quarter, Kansas State took a 24–14 lead and Colt McCoy was injured and headed to the locker room just before halftime. McCoy came back as the Longhorn quarterback at the start of the third quarter, but Texas was never able to erase the point deficit and lost, 41–21. With about two minutes left in the game, McCoy again headed to the locker room early and Chiles led the Longhorns' last drive. The Texas Longhorn band and the alumni band perform during the rain at halftime. McCoy threw for 200 yards and had four interceptions during his worst performance of his college career. Sports Illustrated selected him as one of the season's 10 \\"Most Disappointing College Players\\" and noted that his nine interceptions thrown to that point in 2007 were already two more than he threw during the entire 2006 season. Kansas State had no turnovers and scored 21 points on defense and special teams. The Wildcats scored one touchdown on a punt return, one on a kick return, and one on an interception. Previously, Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season. The 41 points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66–3 loss in 1997. The loss to Kansas State was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas. Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated listed several factors that contributed to the Longhorns' struggles. He cited the off-field problems as evidence that no UT player has been able to show the superior leadership skills of Vince Young. Mandel said that McCoy, still only a sophomore, had not been able to completely fill that gap and that McCoy's play had not been as good as during 2006. He also said part of the blame should be placed on an offensive line that lost several starters and had not been able to consistently protect McCoy. Finally, he noted that the running game had been \\"equally inconsistent\\". The win over UT was the Wildcats' first road victory over a top–ten team in school history. ===Oklahoma=== UT Torchlight Parade, 2007 The game against the 2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team marked the 102nd meeting of the Red River Shootout, which has been called one of the greatest sports rivalries in college football. It is Texas' second-longest running rivalry, just behind its rivalry with Texas A&M.; Prior to 2007, Texas led the series 57–39–5, including the last two consecutive wins. The last match-up was a 28–10 Longhorn victory. Since 1929, the game has been held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas typically in mid-October with the State Fair of Texas occurring adjacent to the stadium. 2007 Texas State Fair CBS Sportsline.com listed the game sixth on its list of games to watch during the 2007 season, saying, \\"The annual Red River Shootout in Dallas will once again feature two top-ten teams with the winner being the front-runner for not only a Big 12 title but a factor in the national title picture. The game will also feature one of the best match-ups of the year with Limas Sweed and Billy Pittman of the Longhorns facing against Oklahoma's excellent secondary.\\" Like Texas, Oklahoma suffered a defeat one week before the Red River Shootout, losing to the Colorado Buffaloes. Texas' loss pushed it to number 16 in the coaches poll and number 19 in the AP poll; OU fell to number 10 in both polls. The ranking marked Texas' 114th straight week to be listed in the AP poll, the longest active streak in the country and tying the school record. The Longhorns had been ranked 142 straight weeks in the coaches poll, the longest UT streak in any poll and the country's longest active streak in the coaches poll. On the morning of the Red River Shootout, oddsmakers favored Oklahoma to win by 12–13 points. Texas kicks off to Oklahoma The game was a back-and-forth affair ultimately won by Oklahoma, 28–21. OU's freshman quarterback, Sam Bradford, was 21–of–32 for 244 yards and 3 touchdowns. UT's McCoy was 19–of–26 for 324 yards and two touchdowns, earning the most passing yardage against an Oklahoma team since the 2004-season National Championship Game vs. USC. McCoy threw one interception, and Jamaal Charles lost a fumble inside the Oklahoma five yard-line. For the second straight week, the Texas defense did not cause any turnovers. McCoy, who suffered a concussion the previous week, played the game with his throwing arm bandaged from mid-forearm to biceps and took four sacks and a blind-side late hit after one play had been whistled dead. With the loss, Texas opened conference play 0–2 for the first time since 1956. A bright spot for the Horns was tight end Jermichael Finley, who caught four passes for 149 yards. Jamaal Charles ran for 79 yards and John Chiles carried once for four yards. Counting the sacks to McCoy, Texas had a total of 61 yards rushing. McCoy and Chiles in pre-game warmups Receiver Limas Sweed left the game early because he re-injured his left wrist. He later had surgery to tighten the ligaments in the wrist but the injury ended his collegiate career. The Austin American-Statesman reported \\"Quan Cosby likely will move to Sweed's spot at split end, with Nate Jones moving to flanker. The Longhorns likely will decide between Billy Pittman and Jordan Shipley at slot receiver when Texas is in its base, three-receiver set.\\" Defensive end Aaron Lewis fractured his elbow in the game and was taken out of the lineup indefinitely. The Austin American-Statesman reported \\"A depth chart issued Monday shows Lamarr Houston moving to Lewis' spot at power end, with Brian Orakpo regaining his starting job at quick end. The Longhorns have been dealing with injuries at defensive end all season.\\" Fullback Luke Tiemann also required surgery to repair a broken wrist, but was expected to miss only two games. The 2007 Red River Shootout as viewed from the skyway of the Texas State Fair. Note the color change where the fans are divided at the 50 yard-line. Jeff Duarte of the Houston Chronicle made note of Charles' fumble, McCoy's interception and the low rushing yardage. He said, \\"the Texas Longhorns went back and forth with Oklahoma for most of the game Saturday before eventually succumbing to the same problems that have taken them from a Top 10 ranking to the verge of dropping out of the national polls for the first time in seven years.\\" The win kept the Sooners in position to win the south division of the Big12 Conference and could even allow them back into the national championship race. Asked to assess his personal performance after the loss to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, \\"I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff.\\" He also said there was room for improvement, \\"Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many things we can do better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better.\\" After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said he did not want to hear about bad luck, \\"By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses.\\" Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball. ===Iowa State=== Texas first played Iowa State in 1979, and the Longhorns had won all six matchups coming into the 2007 season. Their last meeting in 2006 concluded with a 37–14 Texas victory. The Cyclones football team was coached by Gene Chizik who was co- defensive coordinator for Texas from 2005–2006. Like Texas, the Cyclones were 0–2 in conference play, but they had only a 1–5 record overall. Their lone victory of the season had been against Iowa when they made a game-winning 28-yard field goal with :01 remaining. As with Kansas State, Texas plays the Cyclones two out of every four years as part of the Big 12 Conference schedule. Despite losses to Kansas State and Oklahoma, Texas remained in the Top 25 coming into the game with Iowa State. The Horns were number 22 in the USA Today coaches poll and number 23 in the Associated Press media poll. Texas extended its streak in the coaches poll to 143 weeks and its streak in the AP poll to 115 weeks. Mack Brown said that he would not change the game plan in facing Chizik but that he needed to adjust sideline signals and snap counts since they were known to the former Texas co-coordinator. Texas plays defense against the Cyclones. The Austin American-Statesman predicted Iowa State's quarterback Bret Meyer and wide receiver Todd Blythe would pose the biggest threat for the Longhorns. The paper also called the Cyclones the worst team in the Big 12 North and predicted that Texas would be 2–2 in conference play after facing Iowa State and Baylor, the worst team in the south division. The Daily Texan reported that the game offered an opportunity for Gene Chizik to get a \\"signature win\\" if his team could beat Texas. Two days prior to the game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 16 points. The Longhorns were in control from the beginning and routed Iowa State 56–3, the worst loss for the Cyclones since 1997. Iowa State got the ball to start the game and made a first down with a pass from Bret Meyer to Todd Blythe. The UT defense prevented them from gaining another first down and the Cyclones punted from their own 37 yard-line; Texas took over at their 42 yard-line. On the first play from scrimmage, Colt McCoy scrambled away from a blitz and saw that Jordan Shipley had broken off his route and was 10 yards behind any Cyclone defender. Shipley caught the pass from McCoy and sped away from the Cyclones to score a 58-yard touchdown. From that point, the Longhorns never relinquished the lead. They led 14–3 at the end of the first quarter and 28–3 at halftime. In the second half, Texas added another 28–points, en route to a 56–3 blowout. The Longhorns' success passing the ball eventually gave way to the running game. John Chiles led the Longhorns with 54 yards on 9 carries. McCoy rushed for 50 yards, while Jamaal Charles carried the ball 7 times for 44 yards. The Longhorns finished with 514 total yards – 298 via the air, and 216 on the ground. The Longhorns forced three turnovers, including two interceptions, without surrendering any themselves. Brandon Foster intercepted a pass from Bret Meyer and returned it for a 39-yard touchdown. Deon Beasley also picked off Meyer, who completed only 17 passes for 111 yards and no touchdowns. The Iowa State University Cyclone Football \\"Varsity\\" Marching Band performs during pregame. Texas fullback Antwan Cobb sprained his left anterior cruciate ligament late in the game, an injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season. Cobb's injury left the Longhorns without a true fullback, although they had not utilized the position often during the season. The only other fullback on the team, Luke Tiemann, was expected to miss one more week with a wrist injury. Mack Brown said Chris Ogbonnaya, the second-team tailback, would move to fullback for the Baylor game. Freshman tight end Blaine Irby had taken some practice at fullback and could also be used in that position. Robert Killebrew was benched after committing two personal foul penalties, a consistent problem for him in the 2007 season. Without a veteran fullback, Texas planned to either run the ball out of the shotgun formation or simply focus on the passing game. Representatives from the Holiday Bowl were in attendance. According to the Austin Statesman, one of them said, \\"We’d love to have Texas, but they’re still hoping to wind up at the Fiesta Bowl.\\" In order to reach the Fiesta Bowl, Texas needed Oklahoma to lose two games, giving Texas a spot in the Big 12 Conference Championship game, which Texas would then have to win. Another possibility was for Oklahoma to make it to the National Championship game and Texas being selected for an at-large Bowl Championship Series bid.\\" ===Baylor=== Marcus Griffin catches an interception, which he returned 91 yards for a touchdown. The game against Baylor was played in Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco, Texas, approximately 100 miles (161 km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin, the home of the University of Texas. Because home UT games are usually a sell-out, Texas games at Baylor have found numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to watch the game. The Longhorns first played the Baylor Bears in 1901 and faced them annually during the days of the Southwest Conference. In the 96 meetings through 2006, Texas' record against the Bears was 70 wins, 22 losses, and 4 ties. The rivalry with Baylor is Texas' third-longest by number of games: only Oklahoma and Texas A&M; have faced Texas more times on the football field. Texas won the 2006 meeting 63–31. In the week prior to the 2007 game, Baylor assistant coach Eric Schnupp was charged with a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct and reckless exposure after he allegedly urinated on the bar of a Waco nightclub. He was suspended indefinitely from the program. Baylor's starting quarterback, Blake Szymanski, was questionable for the game because of a mild concussion he suffered in a game against Kansas. Although Szymanski had been physically cleared to play, back-up quarterbacks Michael Machen and John David Weed were sharing snaps in practice and Baylor coaches said any one of them could get the start against Texas. Two days prior to the game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 25 points. The game was initially a close-fought contest; Texas led by only a touchdown before Deon Beasley intercepted a pass at the Baylor 43-yard line with nine minutes remaining in the game. Texas scored two more touchdowns to outlast the Bears in a 31–10 victory. Texas accumulated 293 passing yards, all by McCoy, compared to 284 by Machen and Weed of Baylor. Vondrell McGee was the leading rusher for Texas, contributing 57 of the team's 177 yards. Baylor's Jay Finley was the Bears' leading rusher, but Baylor was held to only 8 yards rushing overall because of the sacks forced by the Texas defense. It was the tenth straight victory for UT over Baylor. ===Nebraska=== Texas first played the Nebraska Cornhuskers in 1933, and the Longhorns held a 7–4–0 record against Nebraska though 2006. As with Kansas State and Iowa State, Texas plays the Cornhuskers two out of every four years as part of the Big 12 Conference schedule. On the morning of the game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 21 points. The weather forecast called for a high of and sunshine with winds NNE at to . Texas stuck with their passing game for three quarters and was trailed Nebraska most of the way; the Cornhuskers led 17–9 to start the fourth quarter. The Associated Press reported, \\"Once Texas figured out it should be running against one of the nation's worst run defenses, things turned out all right for the Longhorns.\\" Early in the fourth quarter, McCoy took a hard hit as he scrambled outside the pocket. He was shaken up badly enough to leave the game for a play. John Chiles came in at quarterback; his one play, a zone-read handoff to Jamaal Charles, produced 24 yards. According to the Associated Press recap of the game, \\"suddenly Texas had figured out how to beat a Cornhuskers' team that had been steamrolled on the ground in recent weeks. Texas only threw three passes in the fourth quarter.\\" Once Texas switched to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290 yards, including 216 yards and three long touchdown runs in the fourth quarter. His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247 yards by Oklahoma's Billy Simms. Charles explained \\"It was my time to show everyone what I can do. When I saw a hole, I blasted through it.\\" Texas finished with 181 yards passing and 364 yards rushing; Nebraska had 315 yards passing and 132 yards rushing. The running back was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week. The game was a milestone for one coach and a millstone for another; it was the 100th win for Mack Brown at Texas; and it put more pressure on beleaguered Nebraska coach Bill Callahan. Brown remarked on his victory, \\"A hundred is nice. I knew the game was going to come down like it did. It didn’t surprise me. They made sure that I’ll remember it the rest of my life.\\" Callahan was fired five weeks later. ===Oklahoma State=== Texas and OSU prepare for a play as Colt McCoy is displayed on the jumbotron behind the field. From 1916 through 2006, Texas had played the Oklahoma State Cowboys football (OSU) program 21 times and held a 19–2–0 record. Texas came into the 2007 game with a nine-game active winning streak against OSU. The Cowboys' only two victories occurred in 1944 and 1997. The day before the 2007 game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 3 points. The pre-game festivities included an appearance by Challenger, the first bald eagle ever trained to free-fly into sports stadiums, and a fly-over by four F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Oklahoma Air National Guard's 138th Fighter Wing piloted by Oklahoma State alumni. In the 2007 game, Oklahoma State took an early lead and led 35–14 at the start of the fourth quarter. For the fourth time in five years, the Longhorns staged a big rally to win the game. This time, Texas overcame a 21-point fourth quarter deficit to win by three points as time expired in the game. It was the biggest fourth-quarter comeback in Texas Longhorn history. Fox Sports selected Jamaal Charles and Jacob Lacey as their players of the game for Texas and Oklahoma State, respectively. Charles averaged 11.3 yards per carry. ESPN remarked, \\"For the second straight week, Jammal Charles led a late charge for the 15th-ranked Longhorns. He scored two of his three touchdowns in the fourth quarter as Texas (No. 14 AP) outscored Oklahoma State 24–0 in the final 15 minutes.\\" OSU's leading rusher was Dantrell Savage with 102 yards and one touchdown on 23 carries. McCoy was 20 of 28 passing attempts for 283 yards. He had one touchdown pass and three interceptions; he also rushed for 105 yards. Zac Robinson was 30 of 42 for 427 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. Robinson's passing yardage broke the school record, previously held by current head-coach Mike Gundy. Together, the teams had 1,170 yards of offense. The 594 yards allowed by Texas was the most in the 2007 season. Oklahoma State ran 87 plays and used 35:11 minutes of ball possession, compared to 70 plays and 24:49 for Texas. The Longhorns suffered several injuries during the game. According to the Austin American- Statesman, \\"Center Dallas Griffin left the game with a knee injury, linebacker Jared Norton left with a right shoulder injury and Eddie Jones left with a shoulder injury. Brandon Foster injured his chest in the third quarter, and Drew Kelson left the game with a left knee injury.\\" The paper also reported that Griffin's removal from the game may have contributed to several mistakes in snapping the ball to McCoy and that UT might not have been able to win if any of the resulting handling mistakes had been picked up by OSU. ===Texas Tech=== The World's Largest Texas Flag is unveiled on the field prior to kickoff against Texas Tech. Texas' rivalry with the Texas Tech Red Raiders began in 1928 and through 2006, the Longhorns were 42–14–0 against Tech. In the 2006 contest, fifth-ranked Texas barely came away with a 35–31 win over an unranked Texas Tech team. Two days before the 2007 game, oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 6½ points. Pre-game speculation continued about what bowl game might select Texas. Various media predictions included the Gator Bowl, Cotton Bowl Classic, and Holiday Bowl. Holiday Bowl executive director Bruce Binkowski said his bowl would be very interested in pitting Texas against the USC Trojans, whom Texas defeated in the 2006 Rose Bowl. A BCS bowl was also still mentioned as a possibility, with Sports Illustrated saying the Orange Bowl could take Texas. Texas Center Dallas Griffin injured his anterior cruciate ligament against Oklahoma State and was out for the season. Griffin was a senior, meaning his career with the Longhorns ended due to the injury. Backup defensive end Eddie Jones and reserve safety Drew Kelson were also out for the game against Texas Tech. Linebackers Jared Norton and Sergio Kindle were listed as \\"questionable\\" and \\"probable\\", respectively. The Red Raiders were 7–3 on the season and 3–3 in the Big 12 after beating Baylor 37–7 in their most recent game. Quarterback Graham Harrell passed for over 4,000 yards for the second season in a row, becoming the fifth quarterback in NCAA Division I-FBS (formerly Division I-A) to have multiple 4,000-yard seasons. The Austin American-Statesman reported, \\"Defensively, Texas must hope that the injured are quick healers because it's a given that the Longhorns will need every available body against the Red Raiders. Texas Tech fields the most dynamic passing offense in the country, and the Red Raiders also stay on the field an average of 77.3 plays per game. Tech further frustrates a defense by often going for fourth downs. They've been successful on 14 of 23 fourth-down attempts this season. A year ago, Tech was one of three on fourth downs in a 35-31 loss to Texas.\\" With the game falling on Veterans Day weekend, a pre- game ceremony honored veterans and commemorated the 60th year of Texas' ROTC program. Four army helicopters from Fort Hood flew over the stadium after the national anthem. It was also Senior Day for Texas, with 25 players making their last home game appearance. As a group, they had a 42–6 record coming into the game, which represented the third-highest win total for any Texas class. The temperature at kickoff was 84 degrees. On their first offensive series, the Horns scored a touchdown on a pass from McCoy to Shipley. Their defense held Tech to a field goal. Texas offensive tackle Tony Hills injured his leg and left the game on a cart. Texas scored another touchdown on a run by Vondrell McGee to create a 14–3 lead at the end of the first quarter. Tech's Graham Harrell threw a touchdown pass and Texas answered with a rushing touchdown. On the ensuing kick, Texas used a pooch kick which was tipped by a Texas Tech player. The Longhorns' kickoff team recovered the ball, helping put their offense to rush for another touchdown. Tech brought the game to 28–20 with another touchdown. Texas drove into field goal range but tried to throw a touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the half. The pass was intercepted for a touchback and the Red Raiders ran a short play to end the half. Jamal Charles and tight end Jermichael Finley were injured in the second half but were able to return. In the fourth quarter, McCoy suffered a cut to his head but he did not miss any plays due to the injury. McCoy threw for four touchdowns and ran for two more. Both teams kept running their first team offense until late in the game; they combined for 47 points in the final 12 minutes and each scored a touchdown within the final two minutes of play. Tech attempted two onside kicks in an effort to come from behind, but Texas recovered both kicks. During his post-game press conference, Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach excoriated the officiating crew for incompetence and bias. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin, because the officials were incompetent, or because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote \\"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\\" The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported, \\"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\\" ESPN reported, \\"Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\\" The Big 12 fined Leach $10,000, the largest fine in conference history. The win ensured that 2007 was the 10th straight season the Longhorns won nine or more games, a record streak for the Horns. Including Mack Brown's final two seasons at North Carolina, Brown became the only coach in the nation to lead his program to nine or more victories in 12 straight seasons. ===Texas A&M;=== Texas on defense vs. Texas A&M; This game marked the 114th meeting between the Aggies and the Texas Longhorns and was the fourth year of a multi-sport rivalry named the Lone Star Showdown. The football rivalry began in 1894 and continues to be the longest-running rivalry for both the Longhorns and the Aggies; it is the third-longest rivalry in NCAA Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A) football. Texas A&M; came into the 2007 contest with a 35–73–5 record against Texas. Since the series began in 1894, the game has traditionally been played on Thanksgiving Day or Thanksgiving weekend. The 2007 game marks the fourteenth straight game to be scheduled the day after Thanksgiving. The Aggies scored on their opening possession with a 35-yard touchdown with a screen pass from Stephen McGee to Mike Goodson. The Longhorns mustered two first downs, but were forced to punt. Texas A&M; ended their subsequent drive three plays later with a punt of their own. The Longhorns again successfully penetrated into Texas A&M; territory, but Mack Brown opted to call a pooch punt by Colt McCoy on fourth down and four from the Aggie 37-yard line. The Aggies answered with an eighteen-play drive that stalled on the Texas-14 yard line and the Aggies had to settle for a 31-yard field goal by Matt Szymanski. The second quarter started with the Longhorns driving only six yards and being forced to punt again. The Aggies continued to press their advantage and drove down the field until Stephen McGee threw an ill-timed pass that was intercepted by Deon Beasley at the Longhorn 25. Two first-downs later, Texas was forced to punt and pinned Texas A&M; on their own five yard line. Stephen McGee led the offense with several long passes and the Aggies drove to the Texas 5 but again were held short on 3rd down. On 4th and three, the Aggies faked the field goal and the placeholder, T.J. Sanders, ran the ball in for his first career touchdown giving the Aggies a 17–0 lead. The Longhorns started their next drive on their own 20-yard line, where Colt McCoy threw a 62-yard pass to Jamaal Charles. The drive stalled and the Longhorns had to settle for a field goal and went to halftime trailing their arch-rival, 17–3. The third quarter started with promising drives by both teams, each ending when the ball was intercepted. Brandon Foster ran the Longhorns' interception back to the A&M; eight-yard line and Texas scored a touchdown on the next play to pull the Longhorns within seven points. The Aggies drove to the Texas 34 yard line, but the drive stalled out and Texas took over on downs as the fourth-down attempt failed. Colt McCoy fumbled a few plays later to give the ball back to Texas A&M.; Five plays later, Stephen McGee scampered into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown to put the Aggies up 24–10. The Longhorns took little time to answer with a touchdown of their own. Quan Cosby returned the following kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown to pull Texas within seven once again. The next drive started on the Aggie 49-yard line, courtesy of a 42-yard kickoff return by E.J. Shankle. The quarter ended on a seven-yard pass to Mike Goodson. The final quarter of play began with A&M; still moving the ball. Stephen McGee threw a 44-yard pass to Mike Goodson for a touchdown to put the Aggies ahead by the score of 31–17. The Longhorns again went three and out and were forced to punt. The Aggies went down the field quickly and scored another touchdown on a 66-yard pass completion to Earvin Taylor, putting Texas A&M; up by 21 points. Colt McCoy fumbled the ball two plays later, but A&M; was forced to punt the ball away three plays after recovering the fumble. McCoy and the Longhorn offense drove the length of the field to score a touchdown, taking only 99 seconds off the clock in the process. The Aggies lost seven yards over the next three plays and were forced again to punt. The Longhorns drove 73 yards from their own 27, converted two fourth downs, and scored a touchdown. Ryan Bailey missed the extra point, but left the Longhorns only down by eight points. The Aggies took possession on their own 33 and ran the clock out to win the game, 38–30. During the postgame celebration, ABC commentator Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione whether he would return to the team the following year. Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory. At the beginning of the subsequent press conference, Coach Franchione announced his resignation, effective immediately. Shortly thereafter, Texas A&M; announced defensive coordinator Gary Darnell would lead the Aggies in their bowl game. ===Holiday Bowl=== UT cheerleaders perform at the Battle of the Bands, one of the events leading up to the 2007 Holiday Bowl. The Longhorns concluded the season in the 2007 Holiday Bowl on December 27 against the Arizona State Sun Devils. With the loss to Texas A&M;, the Longhorns fell out of contention for a Bowl Championship Series game; their bowl situation was to be decided largely by the play of other Big 12 teams. Number four Missouri beat number two Kansas to win the Big 12 North Division. Missouri rose to the top spot in the BCS rankings prior to facing Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship game. Oklahoma won the game to become the Big 12 Conference champion and secure a berth in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl. Even though Missouri defeated Kansas, won their division, and outranked Kansas in the BCS standings (sixth compared to eighth) the Orange Bowl selected Kansas instead of Missouri to play in the 2008 Orange Bowl. The Tigers were invited to play in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic; the Cotton Bowl Classic had first pick of Big 12 teams after BCS bowls have made their selections. The Holiday Bowl had the next selection and chose Texas. Arizona State University was ranked number 11 in the BCS standings; they completed a 10–2 regular season and won a share of the Pac-10 Conference Championship. The Sun Devils finished the regular season ranked number 11 in the final BCS rankings, number 11 in Coaches poll and number 12 in the AP rankings while Texas was number 19 in the BCS and number 17 in both the coaches and AP rankings. The Sun Devils were eligible for a BCS bowl themselves, but like Missouri, ASU was left out of the BCS selections. Texas dominated the first quarter and set two Holiday Bowl records. The Longhorns' first score, a two-yard pass from Colt McCoy to nose tackle Derek Lokey, was the quickest in game history, and took place with 13:39 remaining in the first quarter. The Longhorns scored 21 points in the first quarter—two more than previous record-holder SMU scored against BYU in 1980. Texas’ defense forced two turnovers and held the Sun Devils scoreless for the period. The game included one of the most bizarre plays of the football season. ASU's Rudy Carpenter fumbled the ball as ASU was close to scoring a touchdown. Chris Jessee, a member of the Longhorns football operations staff and Mack Brown's stepson, stepped onto the field and may or may not have touched the ball as it bounced near the sideline. The ball was recovered by Texas, seemingly preventing an ASU touchdown. However, after a twelve‑minute review, the officials awarded the ball to Arizona State; the Sun Devils scored a touchdown on the next play. The Longhorns won the game, 52–34. The 52 points were the most ever scored by the Longhorns in a bowl game. Joseph Duarte of the Houston Chronicle called the Holiday Bowl the \\"biggest victory of the season in what could serve as a springboard for a preseason Top 10 ranking next season.\\" ==After the season== Two Longhorns were named to postseason All-American lists. Marcus Griffin was selected to the ESPN list and Tony Hills was selected by the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Towards the end of the season, speculation intensified about which players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, \\"We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible when it comes to the NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status.\\" Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, \\"Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back.\\" From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had seven players taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school. On January 2, 2008, Charles announced that he was rescinding his earlier decision and would leave Texas for the NFL. Despite skipping his senior year, Charles ranks fourth on the list of total rushing yards by a UT player, behind Ricky Williams, Cedric Benson, and Earl Campbell, with 3,328 yards. Williams and Campbell each won the Heisman Trophy in their senior seasons. With Charles' departure, quarterback Colt McCoy becomes the leading returning rusher for the Longhorns. Tight end Jermichael Finley also declared he would forgo his senior season to enter the NFL. The draft concluded with five Longhorns selected: Limas Sweed (53rd pick), Jamaal Charles (73rd), Jermichael Finley (91st), Tony Hills (130th), and Frank Okam (151st). In addition, Brandon Foster, Marcus Griffin, Nate Jones and Derek Lokey agreed to sign free-agent contracts with NFL teams. On January 2, 2008, the Longhorns announced that defensive co-coordinator Larry MacDuff would not return for the 2008 season and Duane Akina was demoted to \\"Assistant Head Coach/Defensive Backs\\". The Longhorns hired Will Muschamp as defensive coordinator; he will also coach UT's linebackers. Muschamp was defensive coordinator at Auburn University and will earn a $425,000 salary at Texas. Running backs coach Ken Rucker transferred to a newly created position with the athletic department where he will act as a liaison to high school athletic programs. On January 16, 2008 Texas replaced Rucker by hiring former UT quarterback Major Applewhite. ==References== ==External links== * Texas Longhorns Category:Texas Longhorns football seasons Category:Holiday Bowl champion seasons Texas Longhorns f ","title":"2007 Texas Longhorns football team"},{"id":"9085369","text":"The Ranger 29 is an American sailboat, that was designed by Gary Mull and first built in 1971. ==Production== The boat was built by Ranger Yachts in the United States from 1971 to 1975 and is now out of production.

He tried to assassinate Josip Broz Tito four times, hence his nickname. ==LifeOrigin and youth=== Kavaja was born in 1932, in Peć, Zeta Banovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now Serbia), to gendarmerie father Mitar Kavaja and mother Milja (née Čađenović). Mitar, as a member of the gendarmery, fought numerous times with kachaks (Albanian brigands). Nikola's paternal grandfather was a perjanik (personal guard) of King Nikola I of Montenegro. His paternal family descended from Dobrsko Selo near Cetinje, and were originally surnamed Radišić, however, after a krvna osveta (blood feud), the family changed its name into Kavaja. One of the Radišić brothers had killed a Turk bey, and was forced to flee in order to save his life. The feud brought him as far as Kavajë, in Albania, and when the situation had calmed down he returned to Dobrsko Selo, where the villagers began calling him Kavaja, from where a new brotherhood (bratstvo) emerged, the \\"Kavaje\\". Still, to this day, there exist two brotherhoods in Dobrsko Selo, the Kavaje and Radišići, which are kin by blood. He was brought up in Peć. In April 1941, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Yugoslavia and his family was split up and sent to different prison camps in Albania. In 1944 he returned to Peć to find his family. By his own account, he killed someone for the first time in his life that year when he pushed a wounded German soldier into a well. ===Military and intelligence career=== Early in his life, Kavaja served in the Yugoslav Air Force (RV i PVO), a branch of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), studying at the Air Force Academy in Pančevo where he rose to the rank of second lieutenant. Later he grew disillusioned with the communist regime that controlled FPR Yugoslavia, and joined a secret anti-communist group. In June 1953, as part of his clandestine activities, he sabotaged gas tanks at the Sombor airport. He evaded arrest, and a man who was not involved in the explosion was tried and executed. When his commander in the secret group was arrested, he deserted the air force. He was arrested by Yugoslav authorities while attempting to cross the border into Austria; however, after serving four years of an 18-and-a-half year prison sentence, Kavaja escaped and finally made it to Austria. There, he was detained by Austrian authorities and transferred to an American Army base. After seven months of investigation by American authorities who suspected him of ties to the KGB, Kavaja began to carry out missions for the CIA against Yugoslavia and the USSR, including \\"sabotage, spying, exposing double agents, assassinations.\\" In the 1960s he was living in Paterson, New Jersey making a living as an auto mechanic and good friends with famed criminal authority Vojislav Stanimirovic and his son Pavle Stanimirović. According to Kavaja, one of his major assignments from the CIA was to assassinate Josip Broz Tito, president of Yugoslavia. Tito traveled to Brazil and Kavaja followed, but the chance to kill the leader was foiled when Tito stayed indoors for his entire stay. Kavaja followed Tito from Brazil to Chile, Mexico, and the United States. Upon arrival in America, he and his companions had to be especially careful because he was wanted by the FBI, which did not always share sources with the CIA. Kavaja claimed that in 1971, he staked out Camp David (near Thurmont, Maryland), disguised as a Maryland State Trooper, in order to kill Tito, who was visiting United States President Richard Nixon. Once again, he was foiled when Tito stayed indoors. ===Freedom for the Serbian Fatherland=== Kavaja was a central figure in a group called the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement (, Latin abbr. SOPO). Kavaja claimed that this organization bombed the Yugoslav embassies in Washington, D.C. and Ottawa, Canada and consulates in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto. 1990s recruitment flyer by Kavaja In 1978, Kavaja and SOPO companions numbering over one hundred (including Stojiljko Kajević) were arrested in New York City by U.S. law enforcement officials. Kavaja was released on $250,000 bail, and after visiting his family in New York City, on June 20, 1979 he hijacked an American Airlines 727 (Flight 293 from New York City to Chicago). He planned to demand Kajević's release and then fly to a destination of Kajević's choosing. When he realized that Kajević would not be released, he let the plane's passengers go, retaining only the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. In an odd twist, included in this group was his own lawyer Deyan Rasha Brashich that took the place of the Hostages . David Lenevsky, who is the same attorney used by renowned Serbian-American crime lord Vojislav Stanimirović for the Vizcaya Heist case. He forced the crew to fly back from Chicago to JFK Airport in New York City. There, he transferred to a larger plane (a Boeing 707) and demanded to be taken to Johannesburg, South Africa. On the advice of his lawyer David Lenevsky he flew to Ireland, which he was told did not have an extradition agreement with the United States. Hoping for political asylum, Kavaja surrendered in Shannon, Ireland with attorney Deyan Ranko Brashich and Kavaja was returned to America to again face a criminal trial. Kavaja was in prison from 1979 until being released in 1997 and was to have remained on parole until 2019. He violated his parole by returning to Yugoslavia; had he returned to the United States he would have been arrested and returned to prison. Kavaja formed a military unit for the defense of Serbs in Kosovo. A training camp was established in Piva, Montenegro, where recruits undertook six months training. However his unit was never given permission to be used against the Kosovo Liberation Army. Nikola Kavaja was arrested on April 1, 2003 during Operation Sablja following the assassination of Zoran Đinđić.www.glas- javnosti.rs Kavaja was soon released, however.

The film is set in the Limehouse district in the East End of London and its Chinatown. Among the stars of the film were George Raft and Anna May Wong. The film is named after the song \\"Limehouse Blues\\". It is also known as East End Chant. ==Plot== The film starts in a riverfront slum in Limehouse. The Lily Gardens, a local club, is owned by Chinese-American immigrant Harry Young. Young uses the club as a center of operations for his lucrative smuggling operation. Young is a recent arrival in London, but he has managed to take over crime operations in his area. Rival criminal Pug Talbot is increasingly driven out of business. Talbot is enraged over the situation, and his anger causes him to abuse his own daughter, Toni. The girl has been raised to be a pickpocket and is under her father's control. At one point, Toni is about to be arrested, and Young helps her out. She is grateful for his help and grows very fond of him. Talbot alerts the police about one of Young's operations, in hopes of hurting his rival's business. Toni overhears the plan and warns Young in time. Young manages to evade the police. Talbot is furious at his treacherous daughter and beats her. Young finds out about the abuse and vows revenge against Talbot. Young pretends that he wants to negotiate with Talbot, and invites him for a meeting at his apartment. Talbot accepts the offer, unaware that it is a trap. When Talbot arrives from the meeting, Young has him stabbed to death. The corpse is abandoned in the street. Young offers Toni a job at his organization as a \\"watchdog\\", in exchange for room and board. Toni takes the offer and gets hired. Young has a Chinese lover, Tu Tuan, who is suspicious over his relationship with Toni. She believes her lover has fallen in love with the \\"white girl\\" and warns him against fruitlessly pursuing her. Worried that a jealous Tu Tuan might hurt Toni, Young removes the pickpocket from his operations. He gives Toni an allowance for her living expenses, which she sees as charity. Away from her life of crime and with free time in her hands, Toni goes sight-seeing in London. She soon befriends pet-shop owner Eric Benton, and starts spending her afternoons with him. Toni and Benton fall in love. Toni starts thinking about getting a job to stop financially depending on Young. Young prevents her from doing so, in fear of losing her. Tu Tuan finds out about Toni's love life and warns Young about it. Tu Tuan derides Young for his unrequited love for a white woman, before ending her own relationship with him. Toni confesses to Benton about her criminal past. Benton visits The Lily Gardens and asks for an appointment with Young. In response, Young makes arrangements to have Benton killed, in a manner similar to Talbot. Young soon personally goes on a smuggling mission, and has Toni escort him. He is unaware the police are expecting him this time. A distraught Tu Tuan had betrayed him to the police, before committing suicide. During the mission, Toni finds out about Young's plans to have Benton killed. She is terrified for the safety of her loved one. By her reaction, Young realizes that Toni really loves the other man. He decides to call off the murder plans, and tries to warn his hired assassins in time. He is pursued by the police while trying to reach them, and gets mortally wounded by gunfire. Young calls off the murder in time, and manages to clear Toni's name from any involvement in crime. He then dies because of his wounds. Due to Young's self-sacrifice, Toni and Benton are safe and free to further pursue their relationship. ==Cast== *George Raft as Harry Young *Jean Parker as Toni *Anna May Wong as Tu Tuan *Kent Taylor as Eric Benton *Montagu Love as Pug Talbot ==ProductionDevelopment=== The working title of the film was Limehouse Nights, which was also the title of a book by Thomas Burke. The role of Toni went through casting changes before filming begun. The role was originally intended for Sylvia Sidney, but she turned down offers to play in the film. Heather Angel was tested for the role, without getting hired. The role was eventually offered to Jean Parker. Parker was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at the time, and Paramount Pictures had to come to an agreement to get the actress \\"loaned\\" to them. Anna May Wong was brought out from England to play an important role. Wong told the press the real Limehouse wasn't \\"fully Chinese it was more Asiatic.\\" George Raft wore yellowface. ===Shooting=== Filming took place in October 1934. According to news articles from the 1930s, some scenes of the film were filmed at the port of San Pedro, Los Angeles. The scenes were reportedly directed by William Shea, who is credited as the second unit director. There are some contradictions in the credits of the film. The pressbook of the film mentions Grover Jones among the screenwriters, but not all sources agree. Idwal Jones also reportedly worked on the script. Most sources credit the art direction of the film to Hans Dreier and Robert Usher. However, another source does not mention Usher's involvement. It credits the art direction to Hans Dreier and Roland Anderson. The film reportedly includes genuine \\"oriental artwork\\" in its scenes. The pressbook reports that the artwork was provided by importer Tom Gubbins. An early version of the script is preserved at the library files of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It mention the role of \\"Ching Lee\\", which was intended for James Wing. During filming the title was changed to Limehouse Blues. ==Reception== The film was not a commercial success when first released.Everett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 52 ==References* * *Review of film at New York Times Category:1934 films Category:1934 crime films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about infidelity Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films directed by Alexander Hall Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Limehouse Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by Cyril Hume Category:American crime films ","title":"Limehouse Blues (film)"},{"id":"9085383","text":"Quartets is a 1994 studio album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith.

The concept was embraced by Ramakrishna and Vivekenanda, as well as Mahatma Gandhi. Although commonly thought to be among the ancient Hindu vedas, the phrase is actually attributed to Gandhi, having been used first in September 1930 in his communications to his followers to quell divisions that had begun to develop between Hindus and Muslims toward the end of the British Raj. The concept is one of the key tenets of secularism in India, wherein there is not a separation of church and state, but an attempt by the state to embrace all religions. Sarva dharma sama bhav has been rejected by a small portion of highly conservative Hindu's who claim that religious universalism has led to the loss of many of Hinduism's rich traditions. Sarva dharma sama bhav is often translated as \\"All religions are the same\\" or \\"All path's lead to the same destination [In a religious sense]\\", although its literal meaning is closer to \\"All dharma/faiths are possible\\". This concept of pluralism significantly differs from Abrahamic religions's (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) exclusivist-supremacist doctrine of \\"only my faith, prophet/messenger and book are the only way to salvation\\". Hence, unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has no concept of the Apostasy (prohibition of and punishment for renouncing religion) and the Blasphemy (following being punishable crime: lack of reverence, lack of strict adherence, act of insulting or showing contempt). One issue arises over the fact that while vedas were written in a period when no other religion existed, how would this concept arise? Thus, it is critical to imagine its source. ==See also== * Comparative religion * Hindu–Christianity relations * Hindu–Islamic relations * Hinduism and Judaism * Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb * Unity in diversity * Religious syncretism * Hindutva * We Are the World ==References== ==External links== * Sarva Dharma Samabhãva or Sarva Dharma Sambhrama?

Just as Zelda exclaims something is going to happen, Lucy begins to choke to death on a South Korean Chicken Ball. The film shows the difficulty of Lucy's loved ones, including Zelda, had in coping with her death. But the grief turns to excitement when Zelda receives a book of spells called The Wisdom of Catagonia. Within the book Zelda finds a spell that requires perfect astronomical timing—the moon, the earth, and the dog star must form a perfect isosceles triangle. Zelda performs the spell and Lucy appears. Lucy begins to reacquaint herself with living and with her family who are shocked to see her alive again, one year later, and soon discovers that she cannot simply pick her life back up where she left off. She returns to find her widower husband has sold their home and married her greedy and double-crossing friend from college. Meanwhile, her son has opened his own successful restaurant and married, instead of going to Columbia. When she returns to the hospital in which she died, the emergency room doctor who tried to revive her begins to fall for her. Zelda confides in the doctor that if Lucy does not find love by the next full moon, she will have to go back to the spirit world. He does not believe Zelda. Eventually, the press finds out that Lucy came back from the dead, and plague her, her family, and the hospital the ER doctor works at. Her college friend becomes jealous of her media attention and the attention Lucy is getting from Mr. Chadman. She holds a news conference of her own and tells the media Lucy made the whole thing up—claiming that Lucy used tetrodotoxin as a means to fake her own death. Lucy does not defend herself, as she sees this as an opportunity to rid herself and her friends of the media. Instead, the doctor gets fired, her sister's occult store is vandalized and she is hated by almost everyone, except her family. She decides to end the debacle once and for all by tricking her college friend into admitting she lied about Lucy faking her death in front of the media at a party the hospital is having. Lucy, the doctor, and her family walk away happily. As the credits roll, we see that both Lucy and Zelda get married and have children with their new loves (Lucy has twins played by actresses Annamarie Russo and Ginamarie Russo).

The Cantonese name \\"Hip Sing\\" (協勝) translates roughly to \\"cooperating for success.\\" The Hip Sing Tong, along with their rivals the Four Brothers and the On Leong Tong, would be involved in violent Tong wars for control of Chinatown during the early 1900s. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Hip Sings were involved in drug trafficking operations with the Kuomintang (KMT) and later the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). They would later establish chapters in Chinese-American communities throughout the United States in major cities such as Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco (the latter being subject to a major drug raid by authorities in 1996). Recently some branches have begun to transform back into the legitimate fraternal organization they started as over a century prior. ==Early history == Like many Tongs, it was founded to protect its members from the rampant anti-Chinese prejudice that was common in America at a time, and provide them with a semi-legitimate community structure since they could not rely on police or court systems to resolve internal community disputes. Also like many other Tongs, it eventually became involved in vice in order to fund its operations. While it is arguably most famous for its war with the On Leong Tong in Manhattan's Chinatown, the group that would become the Hip Sing Tong did not actually originate within New York but rather on the West Coast within San Francisco. It moved into New York City in the late 1800s, and soon began to compete with the On Leong Tong for local control under the guidance of its then-leader Sai Wing Mock. This rivalry would eventually erupt into decades of violence, a part of a nationwide conflict between Tongs known as the Tong Wars. ==Recent history == In the last fifty to sixty years, efforts began from within the group to clean up their public image by obfuscating their illegal activities, and in several chapters this would transform into a genuine attempt to become a purely law-abiding organization. There were clear transfers of illegal activities to plausibly deniable associated street gangs, like in New York City where the Hip Sing Tong secretly used the Flying Dragons (gang) to carry out crimes in their stead. However, due to crackdowns, the links between the Hip Sing Association and their gangs become increasingly frayed and some sources believe that the gang had fully broken out of Hip Sing control as early as 1994 . Since the late 1990s, branches of the group have turned their original attempts at plausible deniability into a genuine trend towards becoming fully law-abiding fraternal organizations like other Tongs. The NYC HSA is a permanent member of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and has gotten HSA officer Eric Ng elected president of the organization. Under his presidency, the CCBA has specifically focused on public outreach and fostering direct cooperation between the CCBA and the NYPD to counter gangs and street crime , and members of the NYPD regularly appear at CCBANY-hosted public events to meet with Eric Ng and other members to discuss neighborhood issues and educate the public. However, other branches have seemingly remained involved with organized crime. In contrast to the positive public relationship between the NYC branch and the NYPD, as recently as 2018 a representative of the Chicago police refused to publicly discuss their cities' HSA chapter with a journalist due to \\"ongoing gang investigations\\". And on the West Coast the Portland branch was subject to a major anti-drug trafficking raid by authorities in July of 2012. The secretive nature of the group and apparent relative autonomy between chapters makes it difficult to determine how individual chapters actions reflect on the current trajectory of the group as a whole. ==Notable Members== * Sai Wing Mock AKA \\"Mock Duck\\" * Kai Su \\"Benny\\" Ong ==Branches== The Hip Sing Association building in Seattle, Washington.

A long-time head of Teatr Współczesny (Contemporary Theatre) in Warsaw, he also staged numerous plays abroad, notably in German-speaking countries, in the USA and Leningrad (USSR). Laureate of Witkacy Prize - Critics' Circle Award (1993). == Life and career == Although born in Vienna, Erwin Axer spent most of his early years in Lwów (modern Lviv, Ukraine). Born to a wealthy Jewish family of Maurycy Axer, a noted lawyer, and Ernestine née Schuster, young Erwin decided to devote his life to theatre. In late 1930s his début was Moon of the Caribbes by Eugene O'Neill. In 1938 he also staged Nędza uszczęśliwiona by Maciej Kamieński and The Tidings Brought to Mary by Paul Claudel. The following year he graduated from the State Institute of Theatrical Art and directed Miss Julie by August Strindberg. However, the Invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II put his career to an end. He spent the first years of the Soviet occupation in Lwów, where he made his living acting and staging dramas in the communist- controlled Polish Dramatic Theatre, the only Polish-language theatre left open in the city. However, following the German takeover of the city and the arrest of his father, Axer moved to Warsaw. He took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 and was taken prisoner by the Germans and sent to a quarry in Germany as a slave worker. After the war he returned to Poland and in 1946 became the head of the Chamber Theatre of the Soldiers' House in Łódź, an institution that moved to Warsaw the following year and was renamed the Teatr Współczesny. Axer headed that theatre for almost 40 years and retired only in 1981, following the imposition of the Martial Law in Poland. Between 1954 and 1957 he also headed the National Theatre, the most prestigious scene in post-war Poland. Since 1949 he was also a professor at the Warsaw-based Theatrical Academy. After 1962 Axer regularly directed plays abroad. Among the countries he visited were Germany, Switzerland, USSR, USA and the Netherlands. He was invited by Georgy Tovstonogov to direct three performances at Bolshoy Drama Theatre in Leningrad; the first of them, \\"The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\\" by Bertolt Brecht in 1963, was recognised as one of the best shows of the decade and had a profound influence on the next generation of Russian directors. Since 1972 he has been a collaborator of the Viennese Burgtheater. == References == == Bibliography == *Magdalena Prokopowicz (ed.): \\"Żydzi Polscy. Historie niezwykłe\\".

Her father's position as the second most powerful political personality in Iran, from 1925 to 1932, afforded Iran Teymourtāsh the opportunity to play a prominent role in that country's women's affairs early in life. ==Life== Prior to her father's removal from office in 1932, she attended the American Girl's College in Tehran, i.e. Iran Bethel School, and is believed to have been the first female to appear in public unveiled when she delivered the commencement address for her graduating class from high school in 1930. Shortly later, she founded an association of women with the intended goal of establishing a boarding school for destitute women. This organization would remain active in the years that followed by engaging in charitable work, and among others, establishing evening educational classes for women. In 1931, Iran Teymourtāsh was sent abroad to attend preparatory college in London; however, after a year of attending college, she returned to Iran upon hearing that her father had been arrested on the orders of Reza Shah for having fallen out of favour. Abdolhossein Teymourtāsh was murdered in prison in 1933, and his immediate family was held under house arrest on one of its farflung estates for an extended period of time. While it was not uncommon for Reza Shah to imprison or kill previous associates or prominent politicians, the decision to impose severe collective punishment on Teymourtāsh's family was likely unprecedented during his reign. As such, Iran Teymourtāsh endured eight years of incarceration and exile with several other members of her family. After being released from exile in 1941, Iran Teymourtāsh travelled to Iraq and succeeded in arranging for the extradition to Iran of the individual believed to have killed her father, Dr. Ahmad Ahmadi (\\"Pezeshk Ahmadi\\"), who was subsequently tried and sentenced in Tehran for having arranged the murder of various individuals at Qasr prison on the orders of Reza Shah. Subsequently, given the flourishing of the free press in the period that followed the removal of Reza Shah from the throne, Iran Teymourtāsh served as the first female editor of an Iranian newspaper after she established and published the Rastakhiz newspaper. Nonetheless, within several years of publishing Rastakhiz, Iran sensed that freedom of the press was slowly deteriorating as Mohammad Reza Shah consolidated his hold on power, and she moved to Paris where she lived for the remainder of her life. Iran Teymourtāsh earned a Ph.D. in literature while residing in France where she pursued a career in journalism, and acted briefly as the press attache at the Iranian embassy in Paris. She became an active member of PEN International and André Malraux's International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture. Like her father, Iran Teymourtāsh was awarded France's highest civilian honour, the Legion d'honneur. Apart from her brief engagement to Hossein Ali Qaragozlu before Abdolhossein Teymourtāsh's fall, Iran Teymourtāsh opted to remain single for the remainder of her life. The posthumous release in 1991 of the Confidential Diary of Asadollah Alam, the Shah's closest confidant, revealed that Mohammad Reza Pahlavi intimated to Alam that during his late teenage years he \\"was head over heels in love with Iran Teymourtash\\". In 2009, a book chronicling the lives of Iran Teymourtash, Ashraf Pahlavi and Mariam Firouz, entitled In Se Zan (These Three Women) was authored by Masoud Behnoud and published to wide acclaim in Iran.

He was known in history as an erratic and wasteful ruler, whose actions greatly weakened the Northern Zhou regime. As part of that erratic behavior, he passed the throne to his son Emperor Jing in 579, less than a year after taking the throne, and subsequently entitled not only his wife Yang Lihua empress, but four additional concubines as empresses. After his death in 580, the government was taken over by his father-in-law Yang Jian, who soon deposed his son Emperor Jing, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty. ==Background== Yuwen Yun was born in 559, as the oldest son of Yuwen Yong, then the Duke of Lu and younger brother of Emperor Ming. He was born at Tong Province (同州, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi), as Yuwen Yong was at that time the governor of Tong Province. His mother Li Ezi was Yuwen Yong's concubine. (Yuwen Yong had not yet officially married a wife by that point.) In 560, Emperor Ming was poisoned to death by his cousin, the regent Yuwen Hu. Before he died, he willed that Yuwen Yong succeed him, and Yuwen Yong took the throne (as Emperor Wu). In 561, he created Yuwen Yun the Duke of Lu but did not create him crown prince. Only after Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him in 572 did he create Yuwen Yun crown prince. (Yuwen Yun's mother Consort Li was not created empress, as Emperor Wu married Empress Ashina, the daughter of Tujue's Mugan Khan Ashina Qijin in 568.) ==As crown prince== Emperor Wu often sent Yuwen Yun on tours of the provinces—and when he himself would go on tours of the provinces or go on military campaigns, he would have Yuwen Yun guard the capital Chang'an. In 573, Yuwen Yun married Yang Lihua, the daughter of the general Yang Jian the Duke of Sui, as his wife and crown princess. It was around this time that it came to Emperor Wu's attention that most of Yuwen Yun's associates were men of low character. At the suggestion of the superintendent of the crown prince's palace, Yuwen Xiaobo (), Emperor Wu made Yuchi Yun (), the well-regarded nephew of the general Yuchi Jiong (a cousin of Emperor Wu's), Yuwen Xiaobo's deputy. He also chose a number of men whose characters he had high regard for to serve in other posts as the crown prince's assistance—but Yuwen Yun resented these personnel changes. In 574, when Emperor Wu's mother Empress Dowager Chinu died, Emperor Wu observed a mourning period for her, and during that period, Yuwen Yun served as regent. In spring 576, Emperor Wu sent Yuwen Yun on a campaign against Tuyuhun as its nominal commander, but put Yuwen Xiaobo and Wang Gui () in actual command of the army. In fall 576, the army completed its campaign against Tuyuhun after reaching Tuyuhun's capital Fuqi (伏俟, in modern Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai). Upon return to Chang'an, Wang Gui reported to Emperor Wu that Yuwen Yun and his trusted associates Zheng Yi () and Wang Duan () had committed many immoral activities together. In anger, Emperor Wu battered Yuwen Yun and Zheng with a baton and removed Zheng from his post. Soon, however, Yuwen Yun reinstated Zheng to his post. Historians also noted that Emperor Wu was very strict with the crown prince, treating him no easier than he did the officials. When he heard that Yuwen Yun liked drinking, he issued an edict forbidding any alcohol from entering the crown prince's palace, and whenever the crown prince had faults, he would whip or batter the crown prince, warning him, \\"Do you not know how many crown princes had been deposed in history? Is it that my other sons are unworthy of being crown prince?\\" He also ordered the officials at the crown prince's palace to watch the crown prince closely and submit reports on his actions. In reaction, Yuwen Yun suppressed his own behavior and pretended to have learned his lesson. Nevertheless, Wang Gui repeatedly suggested that Emperor Wu find a better heir, but Emperor Wu declined, because he believed his second son, Yuwen Zan () the Prince of Han to be even less competent than Yuwen Yun, and the other sons to be too young to be considered. In 577, Emperor Wu destroyed rival Northern Qi, seizing its territory. In summer 578, however, he grew ill suddenly while preparing a campaign against Tujue, and he, after entrusting the important matters to Yuwen Xiaobo, died. Yuwen Yun took the throne as Emperor Xuan. ==Reign== Emperor Xuan honored his father Emperor Wu's wife Empress Ashina as empress dowager and created his wife Crown Princess Yang empress. Other than those proper acts, however, he began to carry out a number of inappropriate ones—including immediately promoting of Zheng Yi and having sexual relations with the ladies in waiting in his father's palace. It was also said that not only did he not mourn his father's death, but as he approached his father's casket, he touched the scars from the wounds his father had previously inflicted, and cursed, \\"Old man, you died too late!\\" He soon also honored his mother Consort Li as empress dowager (with the secondary title of Di Taihou () to distinguish Empress Dowager Ashina's title Huang Taihou ()). Upon hearing Emperor Wu's death, Gao Shaoyi, a Northern Qi prince who had claimed Northern Qi's imperial title in exile in Tujue, tried to launch an attack to reestablish Northern Qi, but was quickly repelled and forced to retreat to Tujue territory. Emperor Xuan then turned to killing people that he feared or had grudges against. The first target was his uncle Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi, due to the respect that Yuwen Xian commanded on account of his military abilities, along with Yuwen Xian's friends, the generals Wang Xing (), Dugu Xiong (), and Doulu Shao (). He then turned against Wang Gui, Yuwen Xiaobo, and Yuwen Shenju () -- all close associates of Emperor Wu—as he suspected all of them of having spoken ill of him before Emperor Wu. Yuchi Yun died in fear. Emperor Xuan was obsessed with reestablishing changing the customary protocols that his father had established, and in spring 579, he changed the official uniforms that Emperor Wu had standardized, to instead use the uniforms styled after Eastern Han Dynasty and Cao Wei. He also abolished the penal code that his father had promulgated in 577 and declared several pardons, stating that he believed that Emperor Wu's punishments were too severe—but soon imposed an even more severe penal code. Also contrary to his father's prohibition of Buddhism and Taoism, he made public gestures to honor Taoism. Also in spring 579, Emperor Xuan created his oldest son Yuwen Chan—then six-years-old—the Prince of Lu, and then crown prince. He also promoted Luoyang to the status of secondary capital, moving the subsidiary branches of the six central government departments from Northern Qi's old capital Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei) to Luoyang. Meanwhile, around this time, Tujue's Tuobo Khan (Empress Dowager Ashina's uncle) sought peace. Emperor Xuan, in response, created his cousin (the daughter of his uncle Yuwen Zhao () the Prince of Zhao) Princess Qianjin, offering to marry Princess Qianjin to Tuobo Khan, but with the demand that Tuobo Khan surrender Gao Shaoyi. Tuobo Khan refused. Less than a month after creating Yuwen Chan crown prince, Emperor Xuan formally passed the throne to Yuwen Chan (as Emperor Jing). Emperor Xuan himself claimed the atypical title of \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (天元皇帝, Tianyuan Huangdi), rather than the expected retired emperor title of Taishang Huang. He changed the name of his palace to Tian Tai (天台, \\"heavenly tower\\"), and doubled the number of tassels on his crown, as well as the number of imperial vehicles, litters, clothing, banners, and drums. He changed the name of the young emperor's palace to Zhengyang Palace (), with the same complement of staff as his own palace. Empress Yang's title was changed to \\"Empress Dowager Tianyuan\\" (天元皇太后, Tianyuan Huang Taihou). ==As retired emperor== Historians described that after Emperor Xuan passed the throne to Emperor Jing, he became particularly wasteful, megalomanic, and unrestrained. He referred to himself as \\"Heaven,\\" and required officials who were to visit him to have vegetarian diets for three days and bathe—then customary for the days spent before worshipping a god. He disallowed officials from using belts or decorations for their clothing, and he forbade the use of such characters as \\"heaven\\" (), \\"high\\" (), \\"upper\\" (), and \\"grand\\" (), except by himself. He forbade women, other than the women of the palace, from using cosmetics, and for reasons unknown, he ordered that all wheels be made from single pieces of wood, disallowing assembling. It was further recorded that whenever Emperor Xuan met with officials, he only discussed with them how to change customs or how to build palaces, disregarding the affairs of state. He spent his days in games and tours, wearing out his attendants. The officials often were caned—initially, 120 times per caning, and later increased to 240 times. The terror imposed on the officials and even the women of the palace was so great that no one dared to say anything. In summer 579, Emperor Xuan created Emperor Jing's mother Consort Zhu Manyue \\"Empress Tianyuan\\" (天元帝后, Tianyuan Di Hou). He also set up fiefs for his uncles Yuwen Zhao, Yuwen Chun () the Prince of Chen, Yuwen Sheng () the Prince of Yue, Yuwen Da () the Prince of Dai, and Yuwen You () the Prince of Teng, and sent them away from Chang'an, to their fiefs. In fall 579, in a highly unorthodox action, Emperor Xuan created two more empresses -- Consort Yuan Leshang as \\"Heavenly Right Empress\\" (天右皇后, Tian You Huanghou) and Consort Chen Yueyi as \\"Heavenly Left Empress\\" (天左皇后, Tian Zuo Huanghou), changing Empress Zhu's title to \\"Heavenly Empress\\" (天皇后, Tian Huanghou). Also around this time, when Yuchi Chifan the daughter-in-law of his cousin Yuwen Liang () the Duke of Qi was at the palace to greet him, he raped her. In winter 579, Emperor Xuan officially ended the prohibitions against Taoism and Buddhism that Emperor Wu had declared, and he personally sat with the statues of Buddhist and Taoist deities. He also launched a major attack on rival Chen Dynasty. By spring 580, the Northern Zhou army had taken the territory between the Yangtze River and the Huai River from Chen. As the army was withdrawing, Yuwen Liang, serving as a general on the campaign, tried to ambush his commander Wei Xiaokuan and seize Wei's troops, and then declare a rebellion to support one of his uncles as emperor. Wei found out about Yuwen Liang's plot and was able to repel his attack, and was able to kill him. Emperor Xuan then also killed Yuwen Liang's son Yuwen Wen () the Duke of Xiyang, and then took Yuwen Wen's wife Duchess Yuchi as a consort. Then, against opposition that he already had too many empresses, he created her as another empress. By this point, Emperor Xuan was becoming even more erratic in his behavior, and at one point, he became suddenly angry at Empress Yang and wanted to punish her. She, however, remained calm but firm in defense of herself, which made him more angry, and he ordered her to commit suicide. Empress Yang's mother, Duchess Dugu Qieluo, had to plead earnestly for Empress Yang's life, before he finally spared Empress Yang. Meanwhile, however, Emperor Xuan was suspicious of the abilities of Empress Yang's father Yang Jian, and he considered killing Yang Jian but ultimately did not do so. As Yang Jian and Zheng Yi were friends, Yang Jian made a secret request to Zheng to give him a post away from the capital, and soon, by Zheng's recommendation, Emperor Xuan made Yang Jian the commander of the forces against Chen (as he then prepared another attack against Chen). Before the army could depart, however, Emperor Xuan suddenly grew ill in summer 580. He summoned his associates Liu Fang () and Yan Zhiyi () to try to entrust the affairs to them, but when they arrived, he was already unable to speak. Liu, after consulting with fellow attendants Zheng, Liu Qiu (), Wei Mo (), and Huangfu Ji (), decided to summon Yang Jian to attend to Emperor Xuan and to serve as regent if Emperor Xuan should die—against Yan's attempt to have Yuwen Zhao made regent. Yang initially declined, apparently fearing that it was a trap, but eventually arrived at the palace. That night, Emperor Xuan died, and Yang seized the control of the palace and the imperial troops. Within a year, Yang would seize the throne, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty. ==Era name== * Dacheng (大成 dà chéng) 579 ==Family== * Parents: ** Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu (; 543–578) ** Empress Dowager, of the Li clan (; 535–588), personal name Ezi () * Consorts and Issue: ** Empress, of the Yang clan (; 561–609), personal name Lihua () *** A daughter (578–615), personal name Eying (), who married Li Min (; 576–614), and had issue (one daughter) ** Empress, of the Zhu clan (; 547–586), personal name Manyue () *** Yuwen Chan, Emperor Jing (; 573–581), first son ** Empress, of the Chen clan (; 565–650), personal name Yueyi () ** Empress, of the Yuchi clan (; 566–595), personal name Chifan () ** Empress, of the Yuan clan of Henan (; b. 565), personal name Leshang () ** Lady, of the Wang clan () *** Yuwen Kan, Prince Lai (; d. 581), second son ** Lady, of the Huangfu clan () *** Yuwen Shu, Prince Ying (; d. 581), third son ==References== Category:Northern Zhou emperors Category:559 births Category:580 deaths Category:People from Weinan ","title":"Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou"},{"id":"9085597","text":"Akhtar Shirani (), (also spelled 'Sheerani', 'Sherani', 'Shirani', 'Shairani'), (4 May 1905 – 9 September 1948) is considered to be one of the leading romantic poets of Urdu language.http://www.poemhunter.com/akhtar- sheerani/biography/, Profile of Akhtar Sheearni on poemhunter.com website, Retrieved 19 October 2016 ==Early life and career== Akhtar Shairani was born as Muhammad Dawood Khan to the Pashtun Sherani tribe, Shirani tribe which had come to South Asia with the armies of Sultan Mahmood Ghaznawi and had stayed back in and around the region of Tonk in North West Pakistan. He was a son of Hafiz Mahmood Shairani, a scholar and teacher of high repute, who had started teaching at Islamia College, Lahore in 1921. In 1928 he moved to Oriental College, Lahore. Young Dawood moved to Lahore at a very young age and lived there throughout his life. He did his Munshi Fazil منشی فاضل in 1921 and Adeeb Fazil ادیب فاضل in 1922 (degrees in Arabic and Persian) from Oriental College, Lahore.http://www.urdupoint.com/poetry/poet/akhtar-sheerani, Profile of poet Akhtar Sheerani on urdupoint.com website, Retrieved 19 October 2016 Despite the efforts of his father, he could not continue his education and became a full-time poet. His teacher in poetry (ustad) was Maulana Tajwar Najibabadi, a well-respected personality in literary circles of Lahore who used to publish literary magazines.http://www.urdupoetry.com/shirani.html, Profile of poet Akhtar Sheerani on urdupoetry.com website, Retrieved 19 October 2016 ==Works== As to his skill, Akhtar was quite innovative and introduced new modes in Urdu poetry. At such a green age, he wrote mature and inspiring poetry. He was called شاعرِ رومان (the poet of romance). His best-known collections of poetry include Akhtaristan, Nigarshat-e-Akhtar, Lala-e-toor, Tayyur-e-Aawara, Naghma- e-Haram, Subh-e bahaar, and Shahnaz. He had been editor for the literary magazines Intikhab, Bahaaristan, Khyaalistan, and Romaan from 1923 to 1939. He also wrote columns for daily newspapers Hamdard and Zamindar of Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar and Maulana Zafar Ali Khan respectively. He introduced many new writers in his magazines, including Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi and Qudratullah Shahab (both are well-known Urdu writers). \\"Chandra wati\\", the first afsana (short story) of Qudratullah Shahab, was published in Romaan (Magazine of Akhtar Sheerani). In total, he left nine collections of his verses. In prose, apart from his fictions and translations, his essays on literary, critical and historical subjects are in abundance. His son Professor Mehmood Sheerani, who has been teaching in Government College University, has written a book on his life named as Kahan Se Laaoon Unhain(Where can I Find Him?). Dr Younus Hasni also wrote a book on the life of Akhtar Sheerani. ==Style and influence on Urdu Poetry== Youth dominates Akhtar's poetry like that of Shelley, Keats, and Byron. Lyricism, subtlety and novelty infuse a new spirit onto his poetry. He exhales verse as a flower exhales fragrance. His verses touching various colourful subjects flow with such tremendous ease and felicity as the reader is moved to ecstasy. Most of the critics have concentrated only on one aspect of his Love Poetry. However, his work was not confined to just the physical beauty of woman. Woman to him is beautiful in all her forms and shapes; the beloved, the wife, the mother and the sister. Wordsworth, the father of romantic poetry finds the immanence of divine spirit in the objects of nature. Akhtar's depiction of nature is second to none but unlike Wordsworth, he finds the objects of nature imbued with the beauty of woman. He uses woman as a symbol that stands for beauty and love permeating the whole universe. Variegated aspects and artistic skills of Akhtar Shairani's poetry lend him a distinguished place in modern Urdu poetry. His influence on Urdu literature, and poetry in particular, earned him a repute of trendsetter. Several distinguished Urdu poets and literary figures have imbibed directly from him.

His young son Javed Mahmood died, his close friend Mirza Shuja Khan committed suicide, his son-in-law Naziruddin Shirani was accidentally drowned, and he was rejected by the woman, named Salma, that he loved. That made him turn to alcohol. On his physical and mental condition, Agha Shorish Kashmiri who was a well known literary, political, and social figure of Lahore, Pakistan, wrote that one was better- off not to see him, since one would be so depressed after seeing him. He was admitted to Mayo Hospital, Lahore on 3 September and died in Lahore on 9 September 1948, just two days before the death of Quaid-e-Azam. Whilst visiting his friend, Hakeem Nayyar Wasty, he died in their home in Masti Gate. * Pakistan Postal Services issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor in 2005 in its 'Poets of Pakistan' series.http://paknetmag.blogspot.com/search/label/Stamps%20of%20Pakistan%20Year%27s%202005, Commemorative postage stamp issued for Akhtar Sheerani by Pakistan Postal Services in 2005 in its 'Poets of Pakistan' series, Retrieved 8 Jan 2017 ==References== ==External links== * Akhtar Sheerani: Poet of Romance * Akhtar Sheerani: Urdu Description , Retrieved 19 October 2016 * Shahab Nama book by Qudratullah Shahab Category:1905 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Urdu poets Category:Indian people of Pashtun descent Category:Pakistani poets Category:Poets from Lahore Category:Poets in British India Category:20th- century Urdu writers ","title":"Akhtar Sheerani"},{"id":"9085599","text":"Giuseppe Averani Giuseppe Averani FRS or Averanus (March 20, 1662, Pisa – August 24, 1738, Florence) was an Italian jurist and naturalist. The son of a mathematician, he studied arts and law in Pisa. In 1685, he was appointed to a professorship of civil law at Pisa, a post he held until his death. As one of the most celebrated legal teachers of his time, his pupils included leading figures of the Italian Enlightenment such as P. Neri, B. Tanucci, A. Tavanti and G.G. De Soria, as well as several traveling European princes. Together with Aulisio and Gravina, Averani was among the founders of Neohumanism in Italy. He reformed Pisan legal studies on a Humanist basis, setting an example to other Italian universities and forming the intellectual basis for the reforms of Tuscan Enlightenment statesmen in the second half of the 18th century. His principal work are the Interpretationes iuris civilis, analyses of fragments of the Digests based on Cujas. Apart from law, Averani was active in theology, astronomy, philosophy and above all experimental physics. The results of his experiments, such as on light, odours, the electricity of bodies and with Robert Boyle's air pump, were well received by contemporaries, including Newton. A member of scientific academies including the Crusca and the Royal Society, Averani founded the Accademia degli Oppressi (Academy of the Oppressed) to hold discussions on physics. ==References== * * Biographical record, University of Pisa website, accessed January 2007 * Biographical entry, website of the Institute and Museum of the History of Science, Florence, accessed January 2007 Category:Italian jurists Category:Italian naturalists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:1662 births Category:1738 deaths Category:People from Pisa Category:18th-century jurists ","title":"Giuseppe Averani"},{"id":"9085638","text":"Woolgarlo is a locality on the foreshores of the Yass River arm of Lake Burrinjuck, in the far eastern part of the Riverina in the Yass Valley Shire of New South Wales, Australia.

It assists the user in finding and installing software on their computer, it sits dormant in the system tray when not in use. CNR offered a large database of Linux programs that were suitable for everyday and specialty usage, it was not only available for Linspire Linux operating systems, but other versions of Linux as well. ==History== In 2002, the legacy CNR was created as a digital software delivery service created by Linspire, Inc. The service provide the desktop Linux user with an online software warehouse from which they could click on a product and have it installed on their desktop automatically. It required a paid membership of $49.95 to use the service. The warehouse hosted free, non- free, and commercial Linux software titles. The service relied on a client application to work in concert with Debian's APT and dpkg to resolve dependencies and install files. In 2006, in support of the community, Linspire changed its membership program to a two-tier system of CNR Basic and CNR Gold. Originally introduced as a $19.95-per-year subscription, the CNR Basic membership was later made free and so now user could access free and non-free software without a subscription. Linspire announced plans on April 24, 2006, to release CNR under a free software/open source license. It could then be used by other Linux distributions. In early 2007, Linspire announced that they were going expand their CNR service to other distributions than their own, namely Debian, Ubuntu, with future extensions for RPM. In doing so, Linspire hoped to consolidate and aggregate all desktop Linux software into one service to provide an easier method of finding and installing all software for desktop Linux. In December 2007, Linspire announced the beta release of their new CNR.com service with support for the updated Linspire and Freespire distributions and for Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty and Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy (planned for Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy in April 2008). On March 10, 2008, Linspire closed the legacy CNR service.Legacy Warehouse === Web software === CNR also provides access to thousands of Web-based applications, providing the Linux community with the option of local Linux and Web Software, available through a single source (as of February 2008). The same abilities to browse and search the library of products with additional abilities planned to improve the Web Software experience (bookmarking). The community will also have the ability to add new products to the already extensive library of applications available. == How it works == CNR.com is built as a collection of services in what is commonly referred to as a service-oriented architecture (SOA). The highly scalable architecture is built using the following JEE 5 technologies: * JavaServer Faces (JSF) with facelets * JBoss Seam * EJB 3.x * MySQL * Hibernate with JBoss Cache * JBoss * Apache Maven The following is a list of the major services and some descriptive information about each one. === Import service === The import service is responsible for importing package repositories, parsing the package metadata, and matching the packages to products using a complex heuristically based algorithm. The Import service supports any Debian based distribution. RPM based packages can be supported by the domain model with additional work specific to the RPM package metadata schema and release management practices. The import service has a 98% success rate matching packages to products with admin support tools for finding and correcting any problems quickly. This service is responsible for making CNR.com the largest software warehouse for desktop Linux. === Warehouse service === The warehouse service contains the web services APIs used by external clients to acquire access to and install products from CNR.com. The APIs are open to the public and are SOAP based. The APIs consist of the following: * partnerLightup – The partnerLightup API provides a UUID MachineID which represents the installation life of a client. The resulting MachineID is required for other warehouse API requests. This API exists for the purpose of auditing the client usage for reporting back to the originating partner. * lightup – The lightup API is the same as the partnerLightup API with the exception that there is no build tracking number to record. * getOses – The getOses API is used to query the warehouse for a list of the supported operating systems. This list is needed when the client cannot properly identify the operating system it is running on and must ask the user to choose from a list of the supported operating systems. * getDistSnapIndex – The getDistSnapIndex API is used to query the server for the aggregate product information for the specified operating system. This API returns a URI for a payload that contains concise product information useful for searching, sorting and viewing in a client. * getDisstSnapIndexDelta – The getDisstSnapIndexDelta API is used to query the server for the aggregate updates and deletes for the product information store given for the specified operating system. * productActionRequest – The productActionRequest API is used to query the server for a download URL for a specific, single product. If the server cannot grant access to the product, a resolution URL will be returned to the client instead so that the request can be resolved and re- executed. * reportActionRequest – The reportActionRequest API is used to report on the execution of the productActionRequest. This data is used to audit the reportActionRequest API success and/or failure. * getProductIdsForPkgBins – The getProductIdsForPkgBins API is used for clients on initial configurations or after changing distributions to determine the products that are already installed on the machine. The client can determine all the binary packages currently installed on the system, and then using this API, can match these products against the products in the distribution snapshot. The warehouse service also handles product requisite management. Product requisites are user access requirements that must be fulfilled before a user can gain install access to a product. The product requisites consist of the following: * Requires purchase * Requires EULA * Must purchase primary product first (used to secure dependencies) === Ecommerce service === The ecommerce service handles all purchases of commercial software, purchases of member services, and the collection of user acceptance of product EULAs for those products that require such. The ecommerce service is also responsible for handling the DRM requirements of software that have them, such as delivering activation codes to the user or account registration with ISVs. === User management === The user management service handles the creation and management of user accounts as well as the authentication and authorization of user accounts and user access respectively. Authentication is managed using LDAP and SSO is utilized via a token federation service. === Package management === The package management service handles the secure and non- secure storage of all the packages and provides for the secure delivery for all types of packages: free, non-free, and commercial, making CNR.com the industry leader for delivering desktop Linux software. This service is also responsible for the categorization of each product. The categories are an XDG base with an extended set of CNR categories not found in the XDG set intended to enhanced searchability. === Community service === The community service provides for the forum, wiki document and blogging features for both the community in general and for each product. Each product has its own mini- community where discussions and self-help community support can thrive. === CNR.com service === This is the presentation layer of the CNR.com architecture and is responsible for providing the Web 2.0 interfaces. These interfaces allow for the following features: * Add/Review/Edit the long and brief description for any product * Add/Review/Edit the product logo and logo thumbnail * Add/Review/Edit product screenshots * Add/Review/Edit product ratings * Add/Review/Edit product reviews * Filter and sort content * Product specifications with instant access to source code and build files Other interfaces include the product chart that has a refresh cycle of once per 10 minutes and various administrative interfaces for viewing and managing product and user data. === Support service === The support service provides for the tracking, managing and resolving of user submitted support issues. It also has a facility for paid support features versus free support features. === Mail lists service === The mail list service is responsible for the mailing list enrollment and subscription management as well as the sending of system emails to the user as a result of some user-based activity on the site. === Secure data === The secure data service is responsible for the secure storage of credit card profiles that the user has elected to save. === Category data === The category data service is responsible for the storage of the data associated with product categories. === Audit data === The audit data service is responsible for the storage of user activity records such as installs, client registration, machine registrations, etc. === Product data === The product data service is responsible for the storage of product specific data as well as the product aggregation data. === Warehouse data === The warehouse data service is responsible for the storage of package level data and distribution level data. === Resource data === The resource data service is responsible for the storage of all images associated with a product including user provided images like logos and screenshots. === CNR client === The CNR client is a desktop client application that interfaces with apt and dpkg on the desktop and with the warehouse web services on the server. It is intended to provide a starting point for the community to build its own variations of client software. The application is written in C++ with the GUI built on the QT framework. API integration is done through the gsoap framework. The CNR client is open source and open licensed so that anyone can use it for their own purposes without any need to license it. Features include: * Installing and Uninstalling software * Listing all software on the local machine * Product and OS level updates with messaging * Auto updating of itself * Distribution selector to enable installing from more than one distribution * Package detection for packages installed outside the CNR system == CNR on other Linux systems == Linspire planned to port the CNR service to the Ubuntu distribution, the company announced plans on April 24, 2006 to release CNR under a free software/open source license. It could then be used by other Linux distributions. On January 23, 2007, a CNR for all website was launched; however, the launching of the warehouse itself was announced for Q2 of 2007. The release of the new free/open-source CNR client and plug-in is planned to coincide with the release of Freespire 2.0 and Linspire 6.0, both of which will include the free/open-source CNR client and plug-inFreespire Roadmap - Freespire (this new CNR is known internally at Linspire/Freespire as \\"CNR 7\\").Freespire 2.0 Schedule - Freespire On July 1, 2008, Linspire changed its corporate name to Digital Cornerstone and was acquired by Xandros. The deal gives Xandros ownership of all Linspire trademarks, patents, and assets, including CNR. It is expected that the CNR client will eventually be made available for Xandros' line of desktop Linux operating systems. In 2009, Xandros introduced a new \\"app store\\" based on CNR and includes access to it in their Presto operating system. === Support === Six distributions were expected to be supported at the time of the CNR 7 launch: Debian, Fedora Core, Freespire, Linspire, openSUSE, and Ubuntu (Feisty Fawn). Support for other distributions was expected starting in 2008. A test version of CNR 7 was released on July 19, 2007.Freespire 2.0 Schedule - Freespire == See also == * Linspire * Freespire * klik (packaging method) == References == == External links == * Desktop Linux - Linspire's CNR to go multi-Linux, remain free * Linux.com - Linspire to make CNR available to users of other distributions * Video - Using Linspire CNR To Install An Application Category:Linux PMS graphical front-ends Category:Free package management systems Category:Installation software Category:Linspire ","title":"CNR (software)"},{"id":"9085660","text":"The Power of One is a television series involving hypnotist Peter Powers travelling around Australia finding volunteers to be hypnotised by him and forced to perform amusing and often embarrassing acts. ==The acts== The acts included in the show usually aim for amusement rather than showing off the hypnotist's skill or convincing the viewers that a person can only be forced to perform the act through hypnosis Examples include: * hypnotising a man to think he is driving an expensive car, when the truth is that they are driving a cheap one, or even a bumper car at a fair. sometimes he also makes them trash the car, with hilarious results * exploiting a personal weakness, such as arachnophobia or shyness * sexually centered acts, such as convincing a man that each of the holes in a pool table is a woman that he has to satisfy, or telling people to \\"become a lapdancer\\" or \\"make love\\" to whichever object they are closest to when he blows in a whistle * making a person do something embarrassing, or, for example, achieve instant orgasm, whenever something he's defined beforehand happens, like the subject hearing music, while being fully aware of what they're doing, but unable to affect it.

Originally used to refer to devices with large wheels and pedals, the term is now used in relation to powered self-balancing scooters with smaller wheels and no pedals such as the Segway PT and the self-balancing hoverboard. ==Etymology== In more recent usage, \\"dicycle\\" has been used for both pedaled and motorised vehicles with wheels of varying sizes, as long as they share a common axis, though not necessarily a common axle. In 2017, the Merriam- Webster's dictionary, limited usage to 'velocipedes with two parallel wheels,' and the Oxford English Dictionary limited it to 'pedal-powered vehicles with large wheels placed parallel to each other'. ==ExamplesSegway PT=== The Segway PT is a two-wheeled self-balancing personal transporter which uses computers, sensors, and electric motors to keep the device upright. The rider commands the PT to go forward or backward by shifting their weight forward or backward on the platform. The maximum speed of the Segway PT is with a range of on a fully charged lithium-ion battery, depending on terrain, riding style, and the condition of the batteries. Invented by Dean Kamen, it is produced by Segway Inc. ===Self-balancing scooter=== The self-balancing scooter is a category of personal transporter which includes all self-balancing powered portable devices with two parallel wheels that includes the Segway PT, the Segway miniPRO and the self-balancing hoverboard. === Diwheel design === thumb The diwheel design has the two large outer wheels completely encompassing an inner frame. The inner frame is free to rotate within the wheels, and is typically supported by a common axle or idlers which roll on the wheels (see figure). Diwheels, like their more popular cousins the monowheel, have been around for almost one and a half centuries. All of these platforms suffer from two common issues affecting driver comfort; slosh and tumbling (also known as gerbilling). Sloshing is when the inner frame oscillates, and it occurs in all monowheels and diwheels where the centre of gravity of the inner frame is offset from the centre line of the wheels. It is very prevalent as these platforms typically have low damping between the wheel and the frame, to minimise power consumption during locomotion. In addition, during severe braking or acceleration the inner frame will tumble relative to the earth centred frame, which affects the ability of the driver to control the platform. Both the sloshing and tumbling issue can be controlled through feedback control, and has been demonstrated successfully. The equations of motion for the diwheel have been published. ==Gallery== == See also == * Uno * Cart ==References== ==External links== * US Patent Class 180/240 (lists all the vehicles coming under powered dicycles). * Dicycles and Diwheels throughout history * Dicyclet - pedal driven Dicycle by Dutch artist Fred Abels * EDWARD, an electric dicycle by University of Adelaide students *Di- Cycle: A Bike That Travels Over Land and Water Category:Land vehicles ","title":"Dicycle"},{"id":"9085695","text":"Jugiong is a locality on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River, in the Hilltops Council Local Government area, New South Wales, Australia.

He hosts numerous variety shows, such as the long running popular Taiwanese variety show Guess. ==Career== In 1987, Wu started out by taking cameo roles in variety shows. He is known for his quick witted humor and open-fire talks, which have attracted both followers and critics. In 1998, Wu provided the voice of the dragon Mushu in the Mandarin dub of the Disney animated film Mulan. Maureen Tcakik of Time Asia described him as the sole Taiwanese entertainer to become a \\"phenomenon\\" and \\"the most popular guy on local television.\\" In 2000, Channel V gave him the award \\"Favorite Chinese Person of the Year\\". In 2001, he had six variety talk shows in Taiwan. Jacky Wu currently ranks one of the most popular and richest entertainers in Taiwan. Known for his quick witted humor and open fire talks, Wu has for the most part been a showboat of river joy and sensationalism. His love life has also been a center of tabloids under the public eye. Contemplating whether to retire after he has earned more than enough money, Wu plans to spend more time with his family in the near future. Jacky Wu discovered Jay Chou's music score at a singing competition and was impressed with its complexity. Wu hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist Vincent Fang. Jay Chou then rose up to become a superstar celebrity in the Chinese arena. He currently ranks as one of the richest entertainers in Taiwan. He had received honorary (non-academic) bachelor's degree from his alma mater – National Taiwan University of Arts for services in the Taiwanese entertainment industry because he never completed his studies in Performance Arts. Wu has been the host of a number of popular shows, including the long-running \\"Guess\\" which won him an honor in 2008's Golden Bell Awards. Wu has mentioned in an interview with mainland website Sina.com.cn that the deadline for his retirement is 30 June 2010. He had hinted at his intention to retire many times, after which he will cease working as an entertainer. \\"I want to lead an easier life,\\" Wu told Sina. \\"I've been in the show business for so long, I just need a change now,\\" said Wu, whose 27-year-long career has included his stint as a host, singer and actor. The star says he will focus on his new company which makes environmentally friendly LED lamps. Wu has returned to television hosting along with several new shows including \\"Guess\\" with co-host Patty Hou since 12 March 2011.

There he came in contact with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP, the student wing of RSS). That association led to an introduction to M. S. Golwalker – the head of RSS. His scholarship has focussed on the RSS and Indian politics. He considers Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph as his mentors, states an article in The Indian Express.A battle between Hindutva and Hinduism is coming, Indian Express, Ashutosh Varshney (August 11, 2018) == Scholarship of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh == Andersen, with Sridhar D. Damle, co-authored the 1987 book The Brotherhood in Saffron: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Hindu Revivalism. The book has been called an authoritative, detailed examination of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), including its early growth in the pre-independence period, its organization, the function of its various officers and the evolution of its ideology. \\"The founders of the RSS concluded that the Hindu social body was weak and disorganized because dharma was neither clearly understood nor correctly observed.\\" It was the task of the Sangh's members to create a stable Hindu society and culture. Penguin. Also in picture Rajdeep Sardesai and Nistula Hebbar. The authors avoid categorizing the RSS as having an ideologically loaded framework and treat it with \\"understanding and objectivity.\\" Roughly half the book focuses on the political involvement of the Sangh, with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the Janata Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and includes information about how the Sangh exerts influence on the political partners. In 2018, Andersen and Damle co-authored The RSS: A View to the Inside. After the book's publication, the Political Science scholar Ashutosh Varshney remarked that \\"Andersen is the only scholar who has observed or studied the RSS for nearly five decades\\". According to Andrew Nathan, Andersen and Damle \\"take an exceptionally well-informed look at the RSS, including its relations with affiliate organizations\\", and discuss how the \\"core concept of Hindutva, or “Hinduness,” is now glossed as loyalty to a vaguely defined Indian civilization rather than adherence to specific religious practices, a revision made easier by the unsystematic character of Hindu beliefs\\" while still \\"espousing aggressive anti-Muslim and socially conservative positions\\".The RSS: A View to the Inside by Walter K. Andersen and Shridhar D. Damle, Reviewed by Andrew J. Nathan, Foreign Affairs (March/April 2019) Andersen calls the book as a sequel to The Brotherhood in Saffron book published in 1987, and one that presents the significant changes in India and the RSS since 1987. According to Andersen, the RSS has formed and grown over a hundred affiliated organizations to help penetrate nearly every part of India. These affiliates now play an active role in lobbying the policy processes.The RSS: A View to the Inside Walter Andersen, India in Transition, Center for the Advanced Study of India, University of Pennsylvania (May 20, 2019); The article also appeared in The Hindu newspaper on May 21 2019 Walter Andersen has also written a four-part series of articles on the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the Economic and Political Weekly in 1972.[a] [b] [c] [d] == References == Category:Living people Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Tongji University faculty Category:American University faculty and staff Category:College of Wooster faculty Category:United States Department of State officials Category:American political scientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Writers about Hindu nationalism ","title":"Walter K.

The supporting cast includes Claire Trevor, Dick Foran, and Victor Jory. The movie was written by Nathanael West based on a story idea by Lester Cole, which in turn was based on the life story of bank robber Roy Gardner. It was directed by Frank Tuttle, and released by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Taxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab. Believing that he has been cheated, Joe reclaims his payments but is arrested for robbery. Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. Desperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears. Some time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life. Hearing footsteps, Joe flees from the police who have followed Laura, and Laura is arrested and jailed as an accomplice. While Laura is in jail, Joe comes up with a plan to steal enough money to make Laura and his daughter financially secure, and he embarks on a robbing spree which earns him the moniker of \\"the Million Dollar Bandit.\\" After serving her sentence, Laura manages to meet with Joe. She again pleads with him to give himself up, and as the police surround them, Joe has no other choice but to do so. ==Cast== ==Development== Lester Cole wrote the original screen story based on the non-fiction article \\"Roy Gardner's Own Story\\", by former bank robber Roy Gardner, J.

In January 1939 Nathanael West was assigned to do a script based on Cole's story. West came up with a treatment which prompted Joseph Breen, then Director of the Production Code Administration, to declare that while his office had handled roughly 3,600 texts over the year, \\"it is our unanimous judgment, here in this office, that this new treatment by Mr. West is, by far, the best piece of craftsmanship in screen adaptation that we have seen – certainly, in a year.\\"Martin, Jay.

Claire Trevor was borrowed from 20th Century Fox. Edward Ludwig was to direct but was replaced by Frank Tuttle. Filming started in May. ==Reception== The film garnered favorable reviews, particularly for its script, which Variety called \\"strongly motivated\\".

From that minor infraction, he becomes involved in a bank holdup but tries to go straight when he falls in love with Claire Trevor.

With a baby in the offing the law picks up his trail again... His warped mind sends him through a series of holdups... to gain enough plunder to provide for his wife and baby.

The term was first formulated by Theo van Doesburg and was then used by him in 1930 to define the difference between his vision of art and that of other abstract artists of the time. After his death in 1931, the term was further defined and popularized by Max Bill, who organized the first international exhibition in 1944 and went on to help promote the style in Latin America. The term was taken up widely after World War 2 and promoted through a number of international exhibitions and art movements. ==Origination== Revue Art Concret, May 1930. After the formal break up of De stijl, following the last issue of its magazine in 1928, van Doesburg began considering the creation of a new collective centered on a similar approach to abstraction. In 1929 he discussed his plans with Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres-García, with candidates for membership of this group including Georges Vantongerloo, Constantin Brancusi, František Kupka, Piet Mondrian, Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart and Antoine Pevsner, among others. However, van Doesburg divided the candidates between artists whose work was still not completely abstract and those free of referentiality. As this classification entailed the possibility of a disqualification of the first group, the discussions between the two soon broke down, prompting Torres-García to team up instead with Belgian critic Michel Seuphor and form the group Cercle et Carré.Wintgens Hötte, Doris (2009) \\"Van Doesburg tackles the continent: passion, drive & calculation\\", in: Gladys Fabre & Doris Wintgens Hötte (red.): Van Doesburg & the International Avant-Garde: Constructing a New World, London, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 10-19. Following this, van Doesburg proceeded to propose a rival group, Art Concret, championing a geometrical abstract art closely related to the aesthetics of Neo-plasticism. In his opinion, the term 'abstract' as applied to art had negative connotations; in its place he preferred the more positive term ‘concrete’.Jean Luc Daval, \\"Avant Garde Art 1914-1939\\", Skira, Geneva 1980, p.171 Van Doesburg was eventually joined by Otto G. Carlsund, Léon Arthur Tutundjian, Jean Hélion and his fellow lodger, the typographer Marcel Wantz (1911-79), who soon left to take up a political career.Jean Hélion, \\"Art Concret 1930: Four Painters and a Magazine”, in Double Rhythm: Writings About Painting, Skyhorse Publishing 2014 In May 1930 they published a single issue of their own French-language magazine, Revue Art Concret, which featured a joint manifesto, positioning them as the more radical group of abstractionists. \\"BASIS OF CONCRETE PAINTING We say: # Art is universal. # A work of art must be entirely conceived and shaped by the mind before its execution. It shall not receive anything of nature’s or sensuality’s or sentimentality’s formal data. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, and so on. # The painting must be entirely built up with purely plastic elements, namely surfaces and colors. A pictorial element does not have any meaning beyond “itself”; as a consequence, a painting does not have any meaning other than “itself”. # The construction of a painting, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable. # The painting technique must be mechanic, i.e., exact, anti- impressionistic. # An effort toward absolute clarity is mandatory.\\" [fabstract Springer p.413-4] The group was short lived and only exhibited together on three occasions in 1930 as part of larger group exhibitions, the first being at the Salon des Surindépendents in June, followed by Production Paris 1930 in Zürich, and in August the exhibition AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in Stockholm, curated by Carlsund. In the catalog to the latter, Carlsund states that the group's \\"programme is clear: absolute Purism. Neo-Plasticism, Purism and Constructivism combined\\".AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst, Stockholm, 1930, p.3 Shortly before van Doesburg's death in 1931, the members of the Art Concret group still active in Paris united with the larger association Abstraction-Création. ==Theoretical background== In 1930, Michel Seuphor had defined the role of the abstract artist in the first issue of Cercle et Carré. It was “to establish, on the foundations of a structure that is simple, severe and unadorned in every part, and within a basis of unconcealed narrow unity with this structure, an architecture which, using the technical means available to its period, expresses in a clear language that which is truly immanent and immutable.”Jean Luc Daval, \\"Avant Garde Art 1914-1939, Skira, Geneva 1980\\", p.171 The art historian Werner Haftmann traces the development of the pure abstraction proposed by Seuphor to the synthesis of Russian Constructivism and Dutch Neo-Plasticism in the Bauhaus, where painting abandoned the artificiality of representation for technological authenticity. “In close connection with architecture and engineering, art should endeavour to give form to life itself … [The former] provided new sources of inspiration as well as new materials – steel, aluminium, glass, synthetic materials.”Hartmann p.285 As van Doesburg had pointed out in his manifesto, in order to be universal, art must abandon subjectivity and find impersonal inspiration purely in the elements of which it is constructed: line, plane and color. Some later artists associated with this tendency, such as Victor Vasarély, Jean Dewasne, Mario Negro and Richard Mortensen, only came to painting after first studying science.Hartmann p.340 Nevertheless, all theoretical advances seek justification in past practice, and in this case the mathematical proportions expressed in abstract form are to be identified in various art forms over millennia. Thus, argued Hartmann, “the elimination of representational images and the overt use of pure geometry do not imply a radical and definitive rejection of the great art of the past, but rather a reassertion of its eternal values stripped of their historical and social disguises.”Hartmann p.341 ==Development== Max Bill, Continuity (Colossus of Frankfurt), 1986, collection: Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt am Main. Max Bill \\"was keen on creating works based on mathematical and geometric foundations—material manifestations of intellectual processes that resisted symbolism.\\" Monolith on the Water—Max Bill’s \\"Continuity\\" in a New Location; Deutsche Bank Art works While Abstraction-Création was a grouping of all modernistic tendencies, there were those within it who carried the idea of mathematically inspired art and the term ‘concrete art’ to other countries when they moved elsewhere. A key figure among them was Joaquin Torres García, who returned to South America in 1934 and mentored artists there. Some of those went on to found the group Arte Concreto Invención in Buenos Aires in 1945.Stiles Another was the designer Max Bill, who had studied at the Bauhaus in 1927-9. After returning to Switzerland, he helped organize the Allianz group to champion the ideals of Concrete Art. In 1944 he organized the first international exhibition in Basle and at the same time founded abstract- konkret, the monthly bulletin of the Gallerie des Eaux Vives in Zurich.Stiles By 1960 Bill was organizing a large retrospective exhibition of Concrete Art in Zürich illustrating 50 years of its development. Abstraction, which had been quietly gathering momentum in Italy between the world wars, emerged officially in the Movimento d'arte concreta (MAC) in 1948, whose foremost exponent, Alberto Magnelli, was another past member of Abstraction-Création and had been living in France for many years. However, some seventy native painters were represented in the Arte astratta e concreta in Italia exhibition held three years later at the National Gallery in Rome.Hartmann, p.340 In Paris recognition of this approach resulted in several exhibitions of which the first was titled Art Concret and held at the Gallerie René Drouin during the summer of 1945. Described as \\"the first major post-World War 2 exhibition of abstract art”,Ann Lee Morgan, Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Art, Rowman & Littlefield 2016 the artists exhibited there included the older generation of abstractionists: Jean Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Sonia Delaunay, César Domela, Otto Freundlich, Jean Gorin, Auguste Herbin, Wassily Kandinsky, Alberto Magnelli, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner and van Doesburg. In the following year a series of annual exhibitions began in the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, which included some of these artists and were devoted, according to its articles of association, to “works of art commonly called: concrete art, non-figurative or abstract art\\".Georges Folmer, \\"Le Salon des Réalités Nouvelles : pour et contre l’art concret\\", p.2 In 1951 Groupe Espace was founded in France to harmonize painting, sculpture and architecture as a single discipline. This grouped sculptors and architects with old established artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Jean Gorin and the newly emergent Jean Dewasne and Victor Vasarély. Its manifesto was published in L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui that year and placarded on the streets of Paris, championing the fundamental presence of the plastic arts in all aspects of life for the harmonious development of all human activities. It extended beside into practical politics, having elected as its honorary president the Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Development, Eugène Claudius-Petit.Eve Roy, “La présence fondamentale de la plastique, L’exposition du Groupe Espace à Biot en 1954: un essai de synthèse des arts”, 2013 As time progressed, a distinction began to be made between 'cold abstraction', which was identified with geometric Concrete Art, and 'warm abstraction', which, as it moved towards the various kinds of Lyrical abstraction, reintroduced personality into art.Anna Moszynska, Abstract Art, Thames & Hudson, London 1990, p.120 The former eventually fed into international movements building on technological aspects championed by the pioneers of Concrete Art, emerging as optical art, kinetic art and programmatic art.Alessandro Del Puppo, L'arte contemporanea: Il secondo novecento, Einaudi, 2013, table 3 page 238. The term Concrete also began to be extended to other disciplines than painting, including sculpture, photography and poetry. Justification for this was theorized in South America in the 1959 Neo-Concrete Manifesto, written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro who included Lygia Clark, Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Pape.Stiles ==International dimension== { class=\\" sortable collapsible\\" - !

The 3.4 km (2.11 miles) wide lake is approximately 45 km northwest of the Tigris–Euphrates confluence. Because of its shape, location, and other details, it has been conjectured to represent an impact crater. == Evidence as an impact crater == Using satellite imagery, Sharad Master suggests the 3.4 km diameter dry lake may be an impact crater based on its nearly circular, slightly polygonal rim shape, and contrasting shape to other lakes in the region. As to its origin, he rules out karst topography, salt doming, tectonic deformation, and igneous intrusion as well as possible bombing or man-made origins. Some structures may initially be found through satellite remote sensing and later established as impact craters like the recently confirmed Santa Marta crater found by Master and J. Heymann.Master, S.; Heymann, J (2000). A Possible New Impact Structure near Gilbués in Piauí Province, Northeastern Brazil, Meteoritics & Planetary Science, vol. 35, Supplement, p.A105A. P. Crósta and M. A. Vasconcelos (2013). Confirmation Of The Impact Origin Of The Santa Marta Crater, Brazil, 76th Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting == Details and historical context == Master estimates the age of the crater to be less than 5000 years old, or between 2000−3000 BC, due to the deposition of sediments of the Tigris- Euphrates plain as a result of the 130–150 km seaward progradation of the Persian Gulf during that time period. Some relate this apparent impact site to the 2350 BC Middle East anomaly.Courty M-A (1998) Causes and effects of the 2350 BC Middle East anomaly evidenced by micro-debris fallout, surface combustion and soil explosion. In: Peiser BJ, Palmer T, Bailey ME (eds) Natural catastrophes during Bronze Age civilisations: archaeological, geological, astronomical and cultural Perspectives. British Archaeol Reports S728, Archaeopress, OxfordGoogle search A lack of writings describing this event by well-known authors like Herodotus (484–425 BC) and Nearchus (360–300 BC) or later historians implies the impact may have occurred much earlier, between 2000−3000 BC. During this time period, the Al Amarah region was approximately 10 m. deep under the Persian Gulf. Impact-induced tsunamis would have devastated coastal Sumerian cities. This may provide an alternate origin of the 2.6 m sediment layer discovered during an excavation of the Sumerian city of Ur by Leonard Woolley in 1922-1934. Descriptive passages in The Epic of Gilgamesh (circa 1600–1800 BC) may describe such an impact and tsunami, suggesting a link to the Sumerian Deluge: == Climate change and impact effects == It has been proposed that sudden climate changes and catastrophic events around 2200 BCE (including the collapse of the Sumerian civilisation) could be linked to a comet or asteroid impact. Master has conjectured that the alleged Umm al Binni impact could be responsible for this catastrophe, producing the energy equivalent to thousands of Hiroshima-sized bombs. Using equations describing impact effects based on work from Collins et al., Shoemaker, Glasstone & Dolan and others, Hamacher determined that an impacting bolide would have produced energy in the range of 190 to 750 megatons of TNT (for an asteroid and comet impact, respectively). For comparison, the Tunguska event was estimated to have an explosive force of about 10-15 megatons. Hamacher's result is dependent on the impactor's density, size, and impact velocity. In order to produce an impact crater with the dimensions of Umm al Binni lake, a Ni-Fe asteroid (density = 7860 kg/m^3, v = 15 km/s) would have been around 100 m in diameter while a comet (density = 500 kg/m^3, v = 25 km/s) would have been between 200 and 300 m in diameter. The resulting impact effects would have caused massive devastation to an area thousands of square kilometres in size, but would not have been sufficient on its own to have caused the wide- scale damage seen at distances exceeding ~100 kilometers from the impact and thus could not be responsible for many of the more distant devastating effects on its own. Although a large mount of circumstantial evidence has been published in the literature suggesting Umm al Binni is an impact crater, no on-site analysis has been done, primarily due to the current volatile and dangerous situation in Iraq. Therefore, Umm al Binni lake remains a possible, albeit unconfirmed, impact structure. ==See also== * 4.2 kiloyear event, c. 2200 BC * 2350 BC Middle East Anomaly * Burckle crater * Great Flood (China), c. 2300 BC * List of possible impact structures on Earth * Tunguska event ==External links== *Google Earth view (taken when the lake was completely dry) == References == Category:Lakes of Iraq Category:Holocene impact craters Category:Possible impact craters on Earth ","title":"Umm al Binni lake"},{"id":"9085789","text":"Jharpokharia (also known as Bombay Chacck among the locals) is a small town in Mayurbhanj district of the Indian state of Odisha and located on Junction of National Highway 6 & National Highway 16.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Available online 29 March 2013 doi: 10.1016/j.ympev.2013.03.015), also known as the spotted mangrove cichlid or black mangrove cichlid, is a species of fish of the cichlid family. It is native to fresh and brackish water in West and Central Africa, but has been introduced to other regions where it is considered invasive. Spotted tilapia have high fecundity, simple food requirements and extensive tolerance of environmental variables such as water temperature, salinity, and pollution. These characteristics allow spotted cichlids to rapidly populate many areas that have an appropriate habitat. Typically spotted tilapia tend to be an aggressive and territorial species, and research has found that internal reproductive androgenic factors can overrule the effect of size on dominance encounters in this species. ==Appearance== Spotted tilapia have a short rounded snout and three anal spines. They are dark olive green to light yellowish in colour and have eight or nine dark bars on their sides which are more evident in young spotted tilapia than adults. They also have two to six dark spots between the bars on the middle of their side and they reach a maximum standard length of . Spotted tilapia have a rapid growth rate and maturation time. ==Habitat== Spotted tilapia are native to Africa from the Côte d'Ivoire to Ghana, and Benin to Cameroon. They have also established large feral populations outside of their native ranges, such as in Florida and Australia. Spotted tilapia live in a variety of habitats. They have been found in both still and flowing waters, in shallow and deep water, in places where there is both little or no coverage and in rocky and debris-strewn areas. ==Breeding and parental care== Like several other tilapiine cichlids, the spotted tilapia is notable for its adaptability and prolific breeding. spotted tilapia breed when they are about long and generally breed year long with peaks in November, March–April and July–September. They lay up to 1800 eggs usually on submerged logs, rocks or plants and the eggs hatch after approximately three days. A juvenile spotted tilapia approx Spotted tilapia are monogamous fish who engage in biparental care, and research has found that the size of the eggs tend to increase with the amount of parental care. The males and females both have very specific roles in parenting and work together to ensure the well being of their offspring. The females prepare the nest by clearing an area on rocky substrate. After spawning, the females take care of all embryo tending while males stay about away and remain mostly inactive except for an occasional feeding or chasing away of predators. When the offspring become two to three days old they rise off the nest and form a school. This causes a dramatic change in parental role as the male becomes active and the female begins to spend more time away from the young, guarding ahead of the school by chasing away predators. Parental care continues until the fish are about . This biparental behaviour could help explain why black tilapia are able to live in many different habitats and become dominant over other fish populations in the same area. ==Ecology== Spotted tilapia feed mainly on plant matter and males and females never feed at the same time. Instead, one will feed while the other stays close by and then they will switch. There are a number of factors that contribute to the natural mortality of spotted tilapia. Their predators include the electric catfish Malapterurus electricus which preys on the eggs of spotted tilapia, and African pike and obscure snakehead which prey on the adults. Spotted tilapia are also prone to heavy intestinal infection caused by nematode parasites which causes death. Also, they sometimes get swept away from their streams by flooding caused by rain into small residual pools over the banks of the stream where they become stranded. Then, when the rain stops the pools dry out they die. Spotted tilapia are important ecologically as well as commercially and as a result are commonly exploited and cultured. ==As an invasive species== In the regions where the spotted tilapia has been introduced it is considered invasive. One main problem with spotted tilapia in their introduced range is that they tend to become the dominant fish in many lakes, rivers and canals. They have even been found to at times comprise over half of the total fish biomass and therefore, they cause other previously dominant fish populations to decrease. Spotted tilapia are strong, aggressive and very territorial and have the ability to disturb the habitat of other fish populations. ===In Australia=== Spotted tilapia caught at the heated outflow of a powerplant in southern Australia It is believed that spotted tilapia got to Australia through a series of events. First it is thought that all tilapia populations derived from the importation of small numbers of individuals for the freshwater aquarium industry from Singapore or Indonesia. Captive individuals were then dispersed throughout Australia by the industry of fish fanciers. Then, some spotted tilapia escaped or were released and self- sustaining populations arose. The expansion of the spotted tilapia species in Australia has potential adverse effects on the native fish faunas that currently exist in Australia. Since they tend to become the dominant fish where they live, their expansion into Australia could be harmful to the other existing fish populations. Another way in which spotted tilapia have become a pest in Australia is that they have been found living in the cooling pondage of the Hazelwood Power Station in Victoria, Australia as well as in the creek just below the pondage. The water temperature in Victoria is far too low for them to survive outside this habitat they have created, however it is a nuisance for the power station that they live here. ===Reaction in Australia=== Since spotted tilapia are considered to be a class 3 noxious fish in Australia it is illegal to possess, sell or buy this species in New South Wales, Australia without a permit. NSW fisheries are closely monitoring the populations of spotted tilapia and heavy fines of up to AU$11,000 apply for being in possession or caught buying or selling this species. The NSW fisheries have the right to seize the fish and destroy them if necessary. ==Etymology== The specific name honours the English writer and explorer Mary Henrietta Kingsley (1862-1900), who had gained possession of the type of this cichlid . ==References== https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.170160 Category:Cichlidae Category:Fish described in 1899 ","title":"Spotted tilapia"},{"id":"9085843","text":"The Lady's from Kentucky is a 1939 film directed by Alexander Hall and starring George Raft and Ellen Drew.

Reism or concretism is a view that only concrete material things exist. It is a philosophical theory associated with Tadeusz Kotarbiński who proposed that it involves both the proper view about the kinds of objects that exist and the literal way of speaking about things. It is based on the ontology of Stanislaw Lesniewski, specifically, his \\"calculus of names\\". This theory, which is also referred to as somatism and pansomatism, has been interpreted as an analogue of defended classic physicalism. == Background == Kotarbiński first introduced reism in his work called Elements of the Theory of Knowledge, Formal Logic and Methodology of the Sciences and the emergent theory was developed independent of the ideas previously put forward by the German philosopher Franz Brentano. The latter's account reism is considered a metaphysical view of the mind. However, Kotarbiński's reism - as proposed - was not a ready theory of the world but a program with the aim of eliminating apparent terms (onomatoids) and partial successes. Kotarbiński's model adopted the formal logic of Lesniewski and his rejection of the classical set-theoretic conception of classes in favor of the mereological whole. For the theorist, mereology is too weak to address the set-theoretical means needed in mathematics. Kotarbiński later cultivated his philosophical connection with Brentano and Kazimierz Twardowski since these authors focused on intentionality. Kotarbiński's reism is also considered an account of intentionality. He also referred to it as pansomatism since it claims that there are only bodies - that everything that exists is only a kind of body. == Interpretations == Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz challenged Kotarbiński's conceptualizaton of reism, arguing that the statement that \\"every object is a thing\\" is a truism. For the latter, the reism principle is translated in the following: \\"For some a, a is an object and for all a, if a is an object then a is a thing.\\" According to Ajdukiewicz, this statement is a truism because a can only be substituted by terms that have denotative capacity. Kotarbiński's pansomatism is just one of the three approaches to reism. It can also take the dualism approach which recognizes that two different kinds of objects exist (e.g. souls and bodies) or the position of spiritual monism, which holds that only persons or mental objects exist. == Ontological and semantical reism == Two versions of reism were introduced as Kotarbiński established that the theory is a comprehensive doctrine that contains both ontological and semantical theses. In the ontological sense, reism was condensed by Kotarbiński to the two postulates. The first is that \\"every object is a body\\" (i.e. all abstract concepts) are to be reduced to concrete objects. Secondly, no object is a state or relation, or property. It is said that Kotarbiński original conceptualization was ontological in the sense that there is only one category of objects. In the semantical sense, it is a view on languages, particularly \\"the conditions of the meaningfulness of sentences\\". As a theory, it draws a distinction between \\"real\\" names, i.e., names associated with bodies and pseudo-names, onomatoids, which denote state of affairs, relations, properties, events, etc. It elaborates on when a sentence is meaningful, when it has a literal, direct sense or when it is meaningful or has an indirect sense. The semantic variation eventually became more accepted in the global reistic enterprise due to the argument that the reistic point of view contains typical onomatoids. ==References== ==External links== * *Tadeusz Kotarbinski, at the Polish Philosophy Page *Tadeusz Kotarbinski from Ontological Reism to Semantical Concretism Category:Theories of language ","title":"Reism"},{"id":"9085890","text":"SunStar Davao is an English language tabloid published daily by SunStar Davao Publishing, Inc. with editorial and business office at Granland Business and Warehouse Center, R.

(2001), Klett & Meyer (2002) ==Systematics== The tilapiines were recognised by the ichthyologist Ethylwynn Trewavas. mtDNA-based phylogenies of tilapiines must be evaluated with caution, however, as they are usually close to, but do not represent the true evolutionary relationships of these fishes. The reason is that hybridization within any one of these major lineages is known to usually produce fertile offspring, and might also do so between the lineages. Gene pools in these fishes have been kept (largely) separate by behavioral cues for millions of years, but reproductive incompatibility has been far slower to evolve, like in many Pseudocrenilabrinae (African cichlids).Nagl et al. (2001) A small sample size—one to a mere handful of specimens per taxon—as is often used in molecular studies further acerbates the problem. As discussed below for the example of mouthbreeding, nonmolecular data such as morphology or behavior have also turned out to be extremely prone to homoplasies, not the least due to the small but ongoing gene flow between evolutionarily quite distant gene pools. Essentially, most traditional and mtDNA-based phylogenetic hypothesis for tilapiines must be considered with a high degree of caution. This problem could be alleviated to some extent by using nDNA sequences. Comparing these with the mtDNA data, hybridization effects could be discerned. Also, resolution of nDNA likely is still good enough to delimit the clades that apparently exist in the \\"tilapiines\\" if numerous taxa and specimens are sampled. Researchers could then reanalyze morphological data to discover actual autapomorphies. Evolution seems to run quickly in this group. Even the fast-evolving mtDNA sequences often are incapable of properly resolving interspecies relationships.Compare support values and proposed relationships in Nagl et al. (2001) to Klett & Meyer (2002) The precise evolutionary history of some tilapiines may not be properly resolved with presently available methods, for the reasons discussed above. ==Diversity of breeding behaviour== Like other cichlids, tilapiines exhibit complex reproductive behaviours and guard their eggs and fry. Broadly speaking, the plesiomorphic trait is substratum-spawning behavior, meaning that the fish form pairs, lay the eggs on a rock or into a depression made in the substrate, and then both parents guard the eggs and fry. ==References== ==Further reading== * Klett, Vera & Meyer, Axel (2002): What, if Anything, is a Tilapia?

Later on, he was the captain of the ill-fated Altalena on behalf of the Irgun at the beginning of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. ==Early life and military service== Monroe Fein was born in Chicago to a middle-class Jewish family in 1923. His father was a lawyer and a donor to Zionist causes. As a child, he excelled in sports such as swimming, running, and boxing. When Fein entered university, he made good use his physical abilities in encounters with antisemites. Following the outbreak of World War II, Fein cut short his studies and enlisted in the United States Navy. He reached the rank of Lieutenant and was appointed commander of a transport ship His ship saw action in the Pacific, participating in the Marshall Islands campaign. He later served on an aircraft carrier that participated in raids on Japan. Following the end of the war, Fein was discharged from the US Navy in 1946. He returned to Chicago and found work as the office manager of a publishing house in Chicago. == Role in the Altalena Affair == Some of the crew of the Altalena. In Chicago, Fein quit his job and volunteered to help the Zionist cause. He met Irgun representative Avraham Stavsky, and was appointed captain of the Altalena on behalf of the Irgun from its departure point in Port-de-Bouc, France to the newly formed state of Israel in June 1948. Upon arriving in Israel the ship was shelled causing incredible controversy and antagonism between Israeli military and paramilitary groups. After the shelling of the Altalena many members of the Irgun were arrested, including Captain Fein. The shelling, controversy and political fallout that came from the fight are collectively known as the Altalena Affair. Following the affair, Fein was arrested, but released a week later due to asthma. While recovering, he stayed in the Geula Hotel in Tel Aviv, where he was looked after by an Irgun nurse, Malca Yefet. He then left Israel and returned to the United States. ==Later life== Following Fein's return to the United States, he studied engineering in Berkeley. His former nurse Malka Yefet eventually also moved to the US, and reestablished contact with him. They met in New York City, developed a relationship, and married on April 21, 1949. In 1952, the couple returned to Israel with their first child, who was about a year old. He did not find a job, and after six months in Israel, they returned to the US after Fein had received a job offer from General Electric. He later worked for a large water and electricity company in California. Malka found work as a nurse in Santa Monica. The couple had four children: Dan, Kenny, Richard, and Sharona. Fein died in Santa Monica on July 2, 1982, at the age of 59. == References == ==External links== * MONROE FEIN (The Altalena, from Shmuel Katz’s memoirs) Category:1923 births Category:1982 deaths ","title":"Monroe Fein"},{"id":"9085926","text":"Mr. Ace is a 1946 American film noir starring George Raft and Sylvia Sidney involving a society woman who taps a gangster for his political support as she runs for Congress. The movie was written by Fred F. Finkelhoffe, directed by Edwin L. Marin, and photographed by legendary cinematographer Karl Struss. George Raft later appeared in a radio show The Cases of Mr. Ace, with Mr. Ace having become a private detective. ==Plot== Wealthy Congresswoman Margaret Wyndham Chase wants to run for governor of an unnamed state and needs the help of a political boss named Eddie Ace to stand a chance of making it all the way. In an attempt to grease him, she invites him to a dinner where also her other powerful friends will be attending. Margaret has another problem. Her husband, Pembroke Chase III, wants a divorce, but she wants to keep up appearances until the governor's election is over. She refuses to sign the document he lays before her. Chase threatens her by saying he will try to ruin her campaign if she doesn't comply with his wish. She, in turn, threatens to reveal his many affairs to the public. Chase tries to ruin the dinner by bad- talking Margaret in front of the others. He gets support from Ace, who believes that beautiful women should stay away from politics. Even Margaret's friend, political science professor Joshua Adams, wants Ace to stop her from running for governor. Adams says he isn't opposed to women in politics but doesn't want Margaret to do it, and believes that she needs more \\"heart\\" to be a truly great governor. Ace introduces Chase to his cronies, The Tomahawk Club, and she charms them all. Later they have a date and Ace begins to fall for Ace. Adams asks Ace to prevent Margaret from being elected, even though he believes that she would make a good governor if she learned to use her heart. Margaret isn't discouraged by this, but decides to work harder on changing the men's views. She meets with Ace and Adams again to discuss politics, and afterwards she asks Ace to drive her to her house in the country. Ace complies and ends up kissing her goodnight, even though he refuses to change his mind about the governor issue. Margaret continues to scheme to persuade Ace to help her. She talks to one of Ace's employees, Toomey, and convinces him to help her. With his help, Margaret is finally nominated to run for governor. But Chase puts gravel in the machinery by forcing her to divorcing him, claiming that she has had an extramarital affair with Ace. He also claims Ace will testify to what happened at the country house. This makes Margaret pull out of the race entirely and agree to the divorce. Adams and Ace decide to host an independent party to support Margaret as a new, reformed candidate. Adams ask Margaret to run on a special issue opposing machine politics, and she agrees. With this support behind her, Margaret wins the election. She is unaware that she got the support of Ace in the run. When Margaret meets Ace after the race, she promises to be the best governor possible, and they kiss to seal the deal. ==Cast== *George Raft as Eddie Ace *Sylvia Sidney as Margaret Wyndham Chase *Stanley Ridges as Toomey *Sid Silvers as Pencil *Jerome Cowan as Peter Craig *Sara Haden as Alma Rhodes *Alan Edwards as Pembroke Chase III *Roman Bohnen as Professor Joshua Adams *Joyce Bryant as nightclub singer ==Production== Producer Benedict Bogeaus had a deal making movies for United Artists. The film was originally going to be called The Congress Woman, and George Raft signed to star in October 1945. It was then retitled Mr Ace and the Queen and Tallulah Bankhead was named as a possible co-star. Later Clare Boothe Luce said she had been approached to play the lead and was considering it. Eventually the female lead went to Sylvia Sidney, who originally starred with Raft thirteen years previously in Pick-Up. Filming started January 30, 1946. Raft was struck with pleurisy during filming, causing the production to shut down for three weeks. ===Production credits=== * Director - Edwin L.

Although he had a successful business career he is most well known for his philanthropic efforts, his activism in the Presbyterian Church, and his investment in the John Crerar Library. John Crerar ==Early years== John Chippewa Crerar born in New York on March 8, 1827 to John Crerar (christened 2 July 1792 Dull, Perthshire, Scotland; died 23 July 1827 New York) and Agnes Smeallie (born 1 April 1797 Kirkliston, Scotland; died 28 March 1873 New York). Agnes was the daughter of Andrew Smeall, born in 1748. She had independently come to New York in the 1820s, where she met John, who had left his native land for the fortunes of America. It is probable that they met each other through the Presbyterian Church to which they both belonged. John died on July 23, 1827 when John was an infant. After John's death, Agnes married John Boyd, the head of the New York branch of a British iron and steel company. John and his brother Peter Crerar (1821–1883) were thus able to receive a comfortable upbringing and good education in New York. ==Career== He started at the New York branch office managed by his stepfather, advancing gradually until being sent to the Boston branch to serve as a bookkeeper. His stint in Boston would last for just over a year, at which time he returned to New York, determined to be independent of his stepfather. He joined a rival large iron firm, working there until the age of 29, always vigilant for a viable escape into an independent business life. Crerar's luck changed when he met Morris K. Jesup, two years his junior, but already having established in 1853 a railroad supply company. Jesup was already a man renowned for his wealth and philanthropy, and he was Crerar's business partner for the rest of his life. In 1856, after several successful years, Jesup sought a new bookkeeper and turned to his new acquaintance John Crerar. Along with Crerar as a member of Jesup's new railroad house was a John S. Kennedy. The firm followed the infant industry and greatly prospered. As the Michigan Southern Railroad and the Michigan Central Railroad came to Chicago in 1852, it soon became apparent that not New York but Chicago would become the capital of the railroad industry. From Jesup's firm, J. McGregor Adams was sent to Chicago, where the branch plant expanded. Adams was soon joined by Crerar as co-junior partners managing the lucrative Chicago branch. In 1863 Adams and Crerar succeeded to the title and established their own firm of Crerar, Adams and Co., retaining however, the old title until 1868. In that year they first advertised themselves as \\"Crerar, Adams & Co., manufacturers and dealers in railroad supplies and contractors' materials, 11 and 13 Wells Street.\\" This location was destroyed by the 1871 fire, situating itself temporarily in a \\"mere shanty\\" and then at the Robbins Building, where it would continue until Crerar's death. With Crerar's increasing prosperity other investments beckoned. He shied away from the real estate market, and from mere speculation. Although conservative in his investments, he was an early investor in the Pullman's revolutionary scheme of sleeping cabins on trains, contributing capital and organization knowledge to the huge Pullman Palace Car Company. When the company was founded in 1867, Crerar was an incorporator and a member of the board of directors, in which capacity he would serve for twenty-two years. Crerar also served as director of the Chicago and Alton Railway, through which he gained his close friendship with T.B. Blackstone. In his will Crerar left Blackstone, although a man of great wealth, a bequest of $5,000, \\"to purchase some memento which will remind him of my appreciation and his uniform and life-long kindness to me.\\" Other directorships included that of the London and Globe Insurance Company, the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank and the Chicago and Joliet Railroad. ==Politics== He was a Republican throughout his life. He only made one personal political attempt. In 1888 he accepted a nomination and was elected a presidential elector, for the Benjamin Harrison campaign. ==Clubs and associations== He became president of the Mercantile Library Association, and played an active civic role as a member of the Union Club, the Union League Club, and the Century Club, memberships he would retain after leaving New York. ==Religion== In New York, he dedicated his energy to the Scottish Presbyterian Church which had nurtured his family during their difficult early years in the city. His zeal for the community and particularly the church continued in Chicago, where he soon became an elder and then a trustee of the Second Presbyterian Church. Despite his growing business concerns, he attended church regularly, constantly reading the Bible, his favourite chapter of which was Romans 8, which he knew by heart. Although generally a quiet man, religious skepticism was known to raise his ire, and he was often blunt in defending his beloved faith and church. An oft-told anecdote has Crerar \\"…exclaim in a tone of impatient disgust, at hearing some one ask if he really believed that Jonah was swallowed by a whale, 'Oh! bosh! What has that got to do with religion?'\\". As the Church moved and expanded, Crerar supported it through labour and capital, ultimately leaving it in his will $100,000, \\"…so long as said church preserves and maintains the principles of the Presbyterian faith.\\" He also left $25,000 to the Second Presbyterian Church of New York, and $50,000 to the Presbyterian League of Chicago. His support of religion crossed denominational lines, however, and was an active supporter of the Young Men's Christian Association, the American Sunday School Union. The Presbyterian Church commemorates its patron with the Crerar Memorial Church at 8100 South Calumet Avenue. ==Philanthropy== His philanthropy was not only confined to religious causes, but he sought to help a wide swath of society. Goodspeed recounts that Crerar kept in the upper- right drawer of his office desk a cheque-book, from which he would dispense charitable gifts. Upon writing a cheque, he would write on the remaining stub the reason for its issuance. The completed stubs indicate the general spirit of his philanthropy, recording a contributions to \\"A woman going about doing good,\\" and the like. As a contemporary said of him, \\"His philanthropy knew no bounds or limits, but was constantly active and progressive, without ostentation.\\" He thus contributed money to such myriad charities as the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Chicago Literary Club, the Chicago Historical Society, the Nursery and Hald Orphan Asylum; St. Luke's Free Hospital; the Chicago Bible Society; Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York, Illinois Training School for Nurses; Old Peoples' Home of Chicago; Chicago Home of the Friendless. He was central in the 1882 founding of the Chicago Manual Training School, later part of the high school of the University of Chicago. A bequest of $50,000 to this institution founded a John Crerar Prize, to be given to the best student of every graduating class. The Crerar School at 8445 South Kolin Street, Chicago is named after him. Although a captain of industry, Crerar never let business smother his love of books and his cultural concerns. In his daily regimen of reading several newspapers, he read for himself and others, gleefully snipping and saving any stories that might amuse his friends. As president of the Mercantile Library Association of New York, he was instrumental in bringing William Makepeace Thackeray, author of Vanity Fair, to America on a lecture tour. In his will he left $10,000 to the Chicago Literary Club. ===John Crerar Library=== Frontispiece from a book in the library. This literary bequest was, of course, shadowed, by his posthumous gift of a library to the city of Chicago, in the form of a two million dollar bequest: It was not he but his executors who chose to make the John Crerar Library primarily a library of scientific, medical and technical reference, as a means of avoiding the literary lure of prurient Parisian prose. As specified in the will, Norman Williams, Crerar's friend and executor, became the first president. The library is now affiliated with the University of Chicago and contains over one million volumes. ===Abraham Lincoln statue=== The last bequest of prominence was $100,000 for a giant statue of Abraham Lincoln. His trustees commissioned the sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens to create this tribute, in his last great work. It was placed in Grant Park. Later it was loaned by the Chicago Parks Commissioners to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, and viewed by millions of visitors in San Francisco in 1915. Speaking of this contribution to the Chicago cultural landscape, Judge B.D. Magruder, speaking before the Chicago Literary Club, said, \\"With a modesty that bespeaks the greatness of his soul, he orders a simple headstone to be placed at his own grave, but that a colossal statue be raised to the man who abolished slavery in the United States. The millionaire is content to lie low, but he insists that the great emancipator shall rise high…This contrast between the headstone and the statue indicates, as plainly as though it had been expressed in words, Mr. Crerar's estimate of true heroism. Doing good to others was his conception of greatness.\\" ==Death== Crerar lived a relatively short life. Soon after reaching his 62nd year, his health began to decline. His doctor, Dr. Frank Billings, accompanied him to Atlantic City, New Jersey, the climate of which was thought to have been good for his health, but on 9 September, he suffered a partial stroke of paralysis on his right side. After a limited recovery, he returned to the home of his closest friend, Norman Williams, where he died on 19 October 1889. On 22 December 1889, a great memorial service was held in the Central Music Hall, from which throngs of mourners had to be turned away. Orators included the Hon. Thomas B. Bryan, Franklin MacVeagh, the Rev. Frank M. Bristol, and Bishop Fallows.Chicago Tribune, 23 December 1889, p.1 Franklin MacVeagh stated that \\"He has set us an example of the right use of wealth, the great uses of wealth, the permanent uses of wealth, and the final uses of wealth.\\" J. McGregor Adams, his business partner and friend, stated: > He was a high-souled generous man, liberal in all things, and one whose > friendship was a thing to be prized and be proud of. He was a philanthropist > of the noblest type and did a wonderful amount of good in a quiet way. For > twenty-five years he and I have been business partners and during that long > period we never had a quarrel or dispute in any way. To his employees he was > always the same, pleasant, genial, approachable. Frank and outspoken and > decided in his views he never hesitated to express them, though it was > always done in an affable manner. He had a vein of quiet humour that made > him a very companionable man. Full of fun and anecdotes, he dearly loved a > good story. He expressed a desire in his will to be buried beside his mother, the central figure in his life, from which he had inherited his religious and social zeal, and who had predeceased him in 1873. Crerar's wish for his own memorial: \\"I ask that I be buried by the side of my honoured mother in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York, in the family lot…I desire that a plain headstone, similar to that which marks my mother's grave, to be raised over my head.\\" It is there that he rests. On the plain headstone is inscribed a fine Presbyterian epitaph: \\"A just man and one that feared God.\\" [Goodspeed 21]. John had his wish, to be buried in the family plot at Greenwood Cemetery [lot 3166, s.80]. ==Litigation over will== After John's death, litigation arose over his will as distant relatives, mostly resident in North Easthope, near Stratford, Ontario, Canada, read of their exclusion from the bequests. The disputants claimed to be first cousins on his father's side, not blaming their omission on spite but on ignorance due to the early death of Crerar's father: > …in his will, Mr. Crerar made no mention of his next of kin on his father's > side and seemed to be ignorant of the fact that there were such next of kin; > that he gave divers large bequests and legacies to his cousins on his > mother's side; that he left no kin of nearer degree than first cousins and > that complainants are his first cousins on his father's side and constitute > all of his first cousins and next of kin, except the first cousins on his > mother's side… The disputants listed in Crerar v. Williams [145 Ill. 625; 34 N.E. 467; 44 Ill. 625] were: Donald Crerar, Peter Crerar, Mary Crerar, Catherine Cramb, Elizabeth McGregor, Duncan Stewart, Alexander Stewart, Peter Stewart, Margaret Crerar, Elizabeth Menzies, Catherine Forsythe, and Elizabeth McIntosh. They filed their suit on 28 May 1891, claiming in the writ to be \\"heirs at law of and next of kin to John Crerar, dec'd\\". The legal battle was fierce and protracted. The will was defended by the law firms of Williams, Holt and Wheeler, and Lyman and Jackson. After a defeat in the Circuit Court, the disputants appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court in Ottawa, Illinois. There, on 19 June 1893, the will was sustained in all its provisions.The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, 20 June 1893 Central to the evidence was the fortitude with which John Crerar had drafted his monumental will. As Goodspeed writes, \\"It was not made in any immediate expectation of death. It was not the hurried work of the sick bed, but the well-considered, fully matured work of a man little past middle age, in the full vigour of health, with the possibility of many years of active life still before him… it was evidently the result of long reflection and final, deliberate, purpose.\\" To the benefit of Chicago, the will was upheld. ==References and notes== * Goodspeed, Thomas W.

The festival is held over a weekend in April. Visitors staying for the whole weekend can camp in the surrounding fields in tents or vans. The festival offers options for those who don't have their own camping equipment in the form of \\"Cosy Camping\\" and \\"Glamping\\". Day tickets are also available. The event takes place over three days and three nights (Friday to Sunday), across 12 stages, which include marquees, a chapel, dance stage and workshop rooms. The program features a variety of musical genres such as blues, roots, Celtic, folk, dance, a cappella and world music as well as acts and activities specifically catering for children and young people. Fairbridge Festival has experienced steady audience growth with the 2016 tally of about 15,000 day attendees. The most common patrons are families, but Fairbridge Festival is enjoyed by all ages including teenagers, young adults and the young at heart. The 2017 Fairbridge Festival celebrated the festival's 25th anniversary, and part of these celebrations include an extended four-day event: 21–24 April 2017. The next festival is scheduled for 26–28 April 2019. ==History== The Festival was established by Max Klubal and Sally Grice, who at the time were committee members of the Western Australian Folk Federation (WAFF). WAFF already ran a folk festival at Toodyay and formed a partnership with the organisation Parents for Music to run the festival at Fairbridge Village, in Pinjarra, with the intention of making it a more family-orientated event than Toodyay. The two festivals continued concurrently for two years but eventually the Toodyay festival ceased. In 1996, Fairbridge Festival disassociated itself from WAFF to its present status as an incorporated not-for-profit association. In 2006, a board of management was incorporated into Fairbridge Festival headed up by a president. During this time, a general manager was also appointed to lead the growing Festival Operations Group. who were mainly volunteers. Up until this point the president, Wendy Corrick, had managed the event. Fairbridge Festival and the organisation, Fairbridge WA, were often confused, particularly in relation to invoicing and accounting matters. Fairbridge WA manages Fairbridge Village, the site of the Fairbridge Festival. To help distinguish the organisations, in November 2011, the incorporation changed its name from Fairbridge Festival Inc. to FolkWorld Inc. This change also better reflects the role of FolkWorld Inc. as the premier peak organisation supporting and promoting Folk Music in Western Australia. Until 2014, Steve Barnes was the artistic director, in charge of programming the festival. Rod Vervest took over as artistic director in 2015. Fairbridge Festival's program is guided by its constitution: “FolkWorld Inc. is dedicated to promoting traditional, contemporary and multicultural folk music, dance and related performing arts, with particular emphasis on the involvement of families.” Overall festival programming is contributed to by several festival programmers, including a Children's Program Director, Youth Program Director and a Dance Program Director. In 2012, the Fairbridge Festival Quest songwriting competition for high school-aged young people was launched and has been unearthing new talent from across Western Australia every year. The 2017 Ben Elton film Three Summers is set at a fictional folk festival in Fairbridge which is called 'Westival', but is inspired by and based on the Fairbridge Festival. Ben Elton is a Patron of FolkWorld Inc. Donations are invited to help support and contribute to the future of Fairbridge Festival and other FolkWorld Inc. initiatives. Donations of $2 or over are tax deductible. The next Fairbridge Festival is scheduled for 26–28 April 2019. ==Site== The festival site was originally Fairbridge School, a combination of orphanage, farm school and Imperial social engineering project set up as part of a colonial vision by Kingsley Fairbridge in 1912. The school was founded with the mission of taking deprived children from the orphanages (such as Dr. Barnardo's Homes) and streets of Britain and giving them a healthy life in the Colonies, (while ensuring that the Colonies continued to be populated with sound Anglo-Saxon stock, as was the prevailing ethos of the time), the school functioned until the early 1960s. ==2018== The 2019 festival will be held 26–28 April 2019. ==2017== The 2017 festival was held 21–24 April.

They play a pair of criminals on parole and working in a department store full of similar cases; Harry Carey's character routinely hires ex-convicts to staff his store. The film was written by Norman Krasna and Virginia Van Upp. ==Plot== Mr Morris, owner of a large department store, hires offenders released on parole to give them a chance to rehabilitate. The other staff do not know, and most of the convicts are unaware of each other. Among them is Joe Dennis, who is resigning and leaving town in order to end his growing friendship with fellow-employee Helen Roberts. With his violent past, he does not feel he could marry such a sweet and innocent girl. They spend a last evening together and, as he boards the Greyhound bus, she says that if he did ask to marry her the answer would be yes. They rush to an instant marriage bureau and then back to her room. The landlady emerges to throw Joe out, but relents when Helen shows her ring. Helen says they must keep the wedding secret, because Mr Morris does not approve of employees marrying each other. In fact he does not mind, but Helen is not allowed to marry while on parole. When Joe finds a bundle of what look like love letters in Helen's room, he becomes jealous of her past and meets up for a drink with some criminals from his past. They plan to rob Morris' store at night, and recruit him to join the operation. But one of the gang is sorry for Helen, if Joe ends up back in prison, and begs her to keep him away that night. She deduces why, and warns Morris. When the robbers break into the store, they are surrounded by armed guards and disarmed. Morris says he will let them go once they have listened to what Helen has to say. With considerable expertise, she outlines on a blackboard the full costs of the operation they had planned and the meager returns each individual would receive if it had succeeded. Joe is not amused by Helen's role in the affair or by her sophisticated knowledge of heist planning. As he does not offer any reconciliation, she packs her things and disappears. Joe and his colleagues search all over town, with no leads until Joe uncovers Helen's probation officer. From him he learns that Helen is pregnant and that her marriage was void as it breached her parole conditions. Keeping an eye on the maternity wards, he eventually discovers her and their newborn son. The film ends with their second but this time valid marriage. ==Cast== * Sylvia Sidney as Helen Dennis * George Raft as Joe Dennis * Barton MacLane as Mickey Bain * Harry Carey as Jerome Morris * Roscoe Karns as Cuffy * George E.

Krasna agreed provided he was allowed to direct. Then Carole Lombard read the script and wanted to be involved; Krasna says Paramount did not want first-time director Krasna to be entrusted with a Lombard-Raft film and tried to force Krasna off the project.*McGilligan, Patrick, \\"Norman Krasna: The Woolworth's Touch\\", Backstory: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age, University of California Press, 1986, p219-220 In 1936 it was reported the film would be delayed because Raft did not want Krasna to direct. There was some talk John Howard might replace Raft. Arline Judge was going to star alongside Lombard. Raft was put on suspension and $24,000 of his salary was withheld. However the film did not go ahead. Then several months later B.P. Schulberg, who was producing a number of films for Paramount, decided to re-activate the project. He replaced Lombard with Sylvia Sidney and the male lead went to John Trent. Richard Wallace was meant to direct. Eventually Raft – who had made a film with Sidney, The Pick Up (1933) – did the film. By May 1937 Schulberg was no longer producer and the director was Fritz Lang who had just made Fury and You Only Live Once with Sidney. Lang used a musical score from Kurt Weill. He used it in an expressionistic style. Lang says he was influenced by Bertolt Brecht, who had developed a style of theatre called Lehrstucke, theatre that teaches. \\"I wanted to make a didactic picture teaching the audience that crime doesn't pay\\", said Lang. \\"Which is a lie, because crime pays very well. The message was spelled out at the end by Sylvia Sidney on a blackboard to a classroom of crooks.\\" Lang says Weill \\"had nothing to do just then.\\" They worked together and Weill composed introductory music for certain scenes. Lang later said the scene where prisoners were nostalgic for prison was \\"stupid\\". ==Production credits== * Fritz Lang - director * Virginia Van Upp - screenplay * Norman Krasna - story * Charles Lang - photography * Hans Dreier - art direction * Ernst Fegté - art direction * Paul Weatherwax - editor * Harry Lindgren - sound recording * Walter Oberst - sound recording * A.

He is best known for his collaborations with suspense writer James Patterson. Gross’s books feature close family bonds, relationships characterized by loss or betrayal and large degree of emotional resonance which generally lead to wider crimes and cover-ups. They have all been published by William Morrow, an imprint of Harper Collins. ==Early life and education== Andrew Gross was born in New York City in 1952. He grew up in Manhattan and attended the Barnard School for Boys. Both his father and his grandfather on his mother’s side were successful clothing manufacturers; they ran the Leslie Fay Companies, named after his mother. Gross received a degree in English from Middlebury College in 1974. In 1979, he met his wife, Lynn, on a blind date in New York City, and they married three years later. In 1982, he received a Masters in Business Policy from Columbia University. ==Business career== After a two-year stint in Denver, where he worked as a dress buyer, he opened a stew-and-soup fast food pilot named Ebeneezer's. He eventually went back to work for his family's publicly held apparel firm, the Leslie Fay Companies. In 1984, Gross took over Head NV Sportswear, the struggling arm of the iconic ski and tennis brand, and by 1989, had repositioned it into the number one upscale producer of tennis and ski apparel in the United States and a thriving brand in Europe as well, before leaving for a larger role at Leslie Fay (which then had close to a billion dollars in annual sales and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange). As Gross describes it, ”sometimes the toughest thing about being in a family company is that it's filled with your own family\\", and in 1991, he left to pursue his own opportunities at Le Coq Sportif, a boutique tennis/golf brand, and Sun Ice, Inc., a Canadian skiwear manufacturer, the latter, “ending poorly and abruptly\\", as Gross says, “and hastening my writing career\\". ==Start in publishing== Gross attended the Writers Program at the University of Iowa. He took three years to finish a draft of his first book, Hydra (1998), a political thriller. He recalls: “after dozens of rejections from agents and ultimately publishers, not knowing what my next step in life was, and sitting around my study, wondering what cliff I was going to drive our SUV off of, I received a phone call from someone who asked, ‘Can you take a call from James Patterson?’” Gross met with Patterson and discussed the early concepts for what ultimately became the Women's Murder Club series. Patterson explained that the head of his publishing house had forwarded Gross's unpublished manuscript to him with the words scratched on the cover: “This guy does women well!” Patterson and Gross formed a partnership in less than a week. Gross worked with Patterson on several books in this series, including Second Chance and Third Degree, both of which went to Number One. Then, they branched out on different themes together, co-authoring the bestsellers The Jester, Lifeguard and Judge and Jury. ==Solo career== In 2006, Gross left Patterson and pursued a solo writing career. In 2007, The Blue Zone debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list in the United States. A year later, it was followed up by The Dark Tide (2007), which the International Thriller Writers Association nominated Thriller of the Year. The Dark Tide featured the fictional detective Ty Hauck of Greenwich, Connecticut, who became the lead character in Gross's corruption and political conspiracy-based bestsellers Don't Look Twice and Reckless. In 2011, Gross departed from Ty Hauck, writing Eyes Wide Open, which builds on two personal stories from his own past. January 2014, Andrew decided to bring back Ty Hauck and started writing One Mile Under () in 2015. He followed it with The One Man, a World War II thriller, in 2016. Kirkus called the book \\"Gross' best work yet\\". Button Man is a 2018 novel about public corruption, extortion and labor racketeering menacing the New York City garment industry during the 1930s. The novel is partly based on the life of Gross's maternal grandfather, Fred P. Pomerantz (1901-86), a garment manufacturer who stood up to mobsters such as Lepke Buchalter, Jacob Shapiro and Emanuel Weiss. ==References== ==BibliographyCollaborative=== * The Jester (2003) * 2nd Chance (2005) * 3rd Degree (2005) * Lifeguard (2005) * Judge and Jury (2006) ===Solo=== * The Blue Zone (2007) * Eyes Wide Open (July 2011), titled Killing Hour in UK/Australia/NZ * 15 Seconds (April 2012) * No Way Back (April 2013) * Everything To Lose (March 2014) * The One Man (August 2016) () * The Saboteur (August 2017) () *Button Man (September 2018) () *The Fifth Column (September 2019) () Ty Hauck series * The Dark Tide (2008) * Don't Look Twice (2009) * Reckless (2010) * One Mile Under (2015) ==External links== *Personal website *MySpace page *Facebook page Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:American thriller writers Category:Writers from New York City Category:Middlebury College alumni Category:Columbia Business School alumni Category:American male novelists Category:Novelists from New York (state) ","title":"Andrew Gross"},{"id":"9086089","text":"beObank, nv/SA/AG is a Belgian bank owned by a French financial conglomerate Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.

Eventually, ABC made the series in arrangement with Alan Hopgood, who wrote the original screenplay. During negotiations, apparently neither Burstall nor Alan Finney (of Hexagon) made any claim that they retained rights in Alvin. However, after the ABC had produced several episodes, Burstall and Hexagon became aware that property in the Alvin character belonged to them, and they sued the ABC for breach of copyright. In the decision Hexagon Pty Ltd and Ors v The Australian Broadcasting Commission [1981] VR 224, the court held that copyright vested in Hexagon; however, they were stopped from enforcing its rights by not seeking to do so, before the ABC commenced its production.

To know how to refer to a person judging by their age requires spending time with Thai people in order to develop a subtle feel for the situation and know which title each person should have in relation to yourself, as Ajarn Spencer Littlewood explains in his E-zine, 'Buddha Magic'; \\"The age of the Monk and the age of the person speaking to the monk will normally affect the way in which a person refers to that Monk. The system is Vague and is a reflection of the method of respect used in everyday Cotidian life in Thailand, where age means status, and the classification of the terminology used for different Family relatives is doubly complex as that Western system. A person who is slightly older than yourself would normally be referred to as \\"Pi\\" (meaning older brother or sister), and a younger person would be called \\"Nong\\". Therefore, if not knowing the title of a Monk, one should see if they are old enough to be ones older brother, one should call them \\"Luang Pi\\" (unless they are a famously established monk, and already have been commonly referred to as \\"Luang Pi\\". If the Monk could be ones Uncle or Father, then \\"Luang Por\\". \\"Luang Lung\\" is sometimes, but very rarely used, meaning \\"reverend uncle\\" but the uncle term is hardly ever to be heard at all, and in most cases the father term is used in its place. The one exception is the word \\"Nong\\" (meaning younger brother or sister) which is never used by a layperson to a Monk, only older terms are used. This is because all Monks are older than laypersons, because, they are 'waking up first, and therefore older'. If old enough to be ones Grandfather, then one should call him either \\"Luang Phu\\" or \\"Luang Dta\\". \\"Luang Phu\\" is a grandfather on the mothers side, and \\"Luang Dta\\", is a grandfather on the fathers side\\".Quoted from 'Buddha Magic E-Publication' with kind permission from Mr. Spencer Littlewood == References == == External links == * Buddha- Magic Buddha Magic - Thai Buddhism and Occultism, Sacred Amulets, Buddhist Culture and Ceremonies, Ruesi-ism and Animism, Sak Yant * Luang Phor - Thai Buddhist Guru Monk Biographies Category:Thai Buddhist titles ","title":"Luang Por"},{"id":"9086301","text":"Goldie is a 1931 American pre-Code black-and-white romantic comedy film.

It was inaugurated in 1957. In 2020, it was temporarily renamed as the \\"Vermont Middle-Grade Book Award\\". The award is co- sponsored by the Vermont State PTA and the Vermont Department of Libraries and was originally named after the Vermont writer Dorothy Canfield Fisher. ==Selection process and award== Each spring a committee of eight adults selects a \\"Master List\\" of thirty books first published during the previous calendar year. The list is announced at the annual Dorothy Canfield Fisher Conference, usually in May, and is available at Vermont school and public libraries for children who wish to participate over the next eleven months. The following spring, those children who have read at least five of the thirty books are eligible to vote for the award, with a deadline in mid-April. The award ceremony is scheduled after the end of the school year, usually late June. Thus the award is always for books published two years previously. The winning writer is invited to visit Vermont to speak with children about the experience of writing for children. == Awards in other categories == Vermont sponsors two other statewide book awards determined by the votes of younger and older students. The Red Clover Book Award recognizes a picture book published two years earlier. Voters are children in grades K–4 who have read, or heard read aloud, all 10 books on the list. The Red Clover BA was established by 1997–98, if not earlier, and its 2014 winner was announced by May. It is the centerpiece of a one-day conference in October. The Green Mountain Book Award is voted by high school students (grades 9–12, routinely ages 14–18) either through a school library or individually online, deadline May 31. Students are asked to vote only once and to read at least 3 from a list of 15 books (for 2014, published 2008–2012; for 2015, published 2011–2013).

He also acted as secretary, chairman and president of Essex, and was also a Test selector for England. ==Cricket career== Pearce made his first-class debut against Sussex at Leyton in 1929. He opened the batting, however number 6 was to become his usual position in the batting order. His selection was based on his high scoring in club cricket, at a time when Essex relied greatly on amateurs. During his first few years as an Essex player, he worked as a banker, however after two seasons he gave it up and started work in the wine trade. His first season as captain in 1933; a role he shared until 1938 with Denys Wilcox, saw Essex rise from 13th to 4th in the County Championship. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack of 1934 reported that \\"Pearce captained with tactical judgment and enjoyed no little success as a batsman\\". A change of job ensured that Pearce could remain Essex's full-time captain until 1950, when he retired. His most prolific season was in 1948, when he scored 1,487 runs at an average of 49.56. He also hit his highest score of his career in the same season, an unbeaten 211 against Leicestershire. Immediately after retiring, Pearce became a Test selector for England. He was also manager of the MCC's tour of India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Pakistan, during the winter of 1961-2. He also selected his own T. N. Pearce's XI, which played against the touring Test side annually between 1951 and 1976. ==Rugby Union career== Pearce was also described as a \\"top-class\\" referee, and took charge of 10 international matches. ==External links== * * Category:1905 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Essex cricketers Category:Essex cricket captains Category:English rugby union referees Category:England cricket team selectors Category:People from Stoke Newington Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

The operation, involving 11 police forces over a -year period, resulted in the break-up of one of the largest LSD manufacturing operations in the world. It culminated in 1977 with enough LSD to make 6.5 million 'tabs' with a then street value of £100m (equivalent to £ today) being seized, 120 people arrested in the UK and France and over £800,000 discovered in Swiss bank accounts. == Background == The two LSD rings broken up by Operation Julie had begun life as one organisation. Its founders were David Solomon, an author, and Richard Kemp, a chemist, who first successfully synthesized LSD in 1969. Unable to effectively distribute the LSD they had made, they turned to Henry Todd to handle sales. At this point the organisation was based in Cambridge. Later Todd enrolled Leaf Fielding as a tabletter, responsible for turning the raw material into accurately measured doses. In 1973, the producers had a bust-up with the distributors and production ceased for a time. Kemp and Solomon set about organising another distribution network and recommenced LSD production in west Wales. Todd recruited a chemist, Andy Munro, to synthesise LSD for his distribution network at a laboratory they set up in Hampton Wick, Greater London. There were now two separate functioning organisations. In 1975, Todd and Fielding changed roles. Todd took over the tabletting, Fielding ran the distribution network, supplying Russell Spencely who in turn supplied Alston Hughes (known as 'Smiles'). From Hughes, the LSD was distributed to a number of wholesale dealers in Wales and Birmingham. In April 1975, Kemp's red Range Rover was involved in a fatal accident with a car near Machynlleth, a passenger in the other car being killed. Kemp was known to Detective Inspector Dick Lee of the Thames Valley Drug Squad as a possible suspect in the drugs trade and when police searched his car they found six pieces of paper which, after being reconstructed, spelt hydrazine hydrate - a key ingredient in the manufacture of LSD. This crucial lead gave police their first vital clue into the drug ring operating in west Wales. == Operation Julie == The discovery in Kemp's car prompted the establishment of Britain's first combined drug busting operation led by Dick Lee of the Thames Valley Drug Squad. On 17 February 1976, a meeting at Brecon involving a number of chief constables and senior drug squad officers formed a multiforce operation. This was the beginning of Operation Julie. In April 1976, a selection of 28 drug squad officers from 10 police forces were chosen and sent to Devizes in Wiltshire where they were trained in surveillance techniques. In May 1976, a police team moved into a farmhouse (named Bronwydd) in Tregaron overlooking Kemp's cottage. Initially, locals took them for birdwatchers. As the surveillance operation progressed from weeks into months, female officers were added. The first name of one of these surveillance officers, Police Sergeant Julie Taylor, was used as the operation's code name. Surveillance of Kemp noted his regular 50-mile commutes between his home in Tregaron and Plas Llysyn, an old mansion owned by an American friend Paul Joseph Arnaboldi, in Carno near Llanidloes. The mansion was watched by police from an old caravan and people arriving were monitored. Lee instructed police to break into the mansion. In the cellar, police took water samples which chemically matched LSD samples the police had. Kemp's home was now put under 24-hour surveillance and listening devices were installed. Lee also instructed two undercover officers to infiltrate the small community of Llanddewi Brefi to target Alston Hughes. == London connection == In October 1976, a police team based at RAF Hendon monitored a house in Seymour Road, Hampton Wick. This was the LSD laboratory run by Todd and Munro. Glass utensils used in this laboratory had been secretly marked by police at the factory that produced them in Yorkshire. == Raids, arrests and trial == On 26 March 1977, after 13 months of surveillance, Operation Julie officers swooped on 87 homes in Wales and England, including Fielding's home in Binfield Heath. ^ https://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/find-things-to-do/reading-students- life-global-lsd-4211433 The gang leaders were caught and a total of 120 suspects were arrested. At Kemp's home a package containing £11,000 was found as well as LSD crystals and tabletting equipment. At Carno, laboratory equipment was dug out of a well. A further raid in the Dordogne region in France located documents that detailed and proved the LSD business had been immense. Details of French and Swiss accounts were found as well as share certificates. On 1 December 1977, officers searched Kemp's cottage for a second time and dug up a large plastic box that contained 1.3 kg of LSD crystal - enough to create 6.5 million doses. In 1978, 15 defendants appeared at Bristol Crown Court. It took a month for the prosecution to deliver the incriminating evidence. Kemp pleaded guilty and received 13 years in gaol, as did Todd. Fielding and Hughes were sentenced to 8 years. In total, the 15 defendants received a combined 120 years in gaol. As a result of the seizure it was estimated the price of LSD tabs rose from £1 to £5 each,Operation Julie: How an LSD raid began the war on drugs (BBC Magazine 12 July 2011) and that Operation Julie had removed 90% of LSD from the British market. It is thought that LSD produced by the two labs had been exported to over 100 countries. In total, 1.1 million tabs and enough LSD crystal to make a further 6.5 million, were discovered and destroyed. == Cultural references == A three- part television drama, called Operation Julie, was made by Tyne Tees Television and broadcast on ITV in 1985, following the events of the case from the police point of view. It was directed by Bob Mahoney. The song \\"Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad\\" by The Clash, from their second album Give 'em Enough Rope, takes its name from Operation Julie. In December 2010, Welsh actor Matthew Rhys bought the film rights to the book, Operation Julie: The World's Greatest LSD Bust, by Lyn Ebenezer. In July 2011, Leaf Fielding's book To Live Outside the Law, gave the first insider account of Operation Julie. Comedian, Paul Merton recalled Operation Julie as the inspiration behind his \\"Policeman on Acid\\" sketch in his autobiography, ″Only When I Laugh″. The radio drama Julie by Rob Gittins was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 26 September 2014. In September 2016, Stephen Bentley's book Undercover: Operation Julie - The Inside Story, gave an account of one of only three undercover officers engaged on the operation. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Bibliography=== * * * Category:1976 in Wales Category:Organised crime in England Category:Organised crime in Wales Category:Lysergic acid diethylamide Julie ","title":"Operation Julie"},{"id":"9086533","text":"Garry Bruce West (born 19 January 1949) is an Australian politician.

He was known as one of the most notorious of China's warlords, known for his troops' atrocities and the looting of Hunan of its wealth during his administration. He was removed from office for his abuses and assassinated in 1933 for aiding the Empire of Japan by attempting to set up the monarchy of Puyi in northern China with Japanese money. Born in 1881, he eventually joined the Beiyang Army, rising to the rank of general, and then was part of the Anhui clique. He was Military Governor of Chahar Province from October 18, 1917, to March 29, 1918. He was then given the post of Military Governor of Hunan province from March 1918. While he was governor his troops committed many atrocities, including killing civilians, robbing the wealthy and rape. He was also accused of reducing the province to a state of beggary. In August 1919, he censored Mao Zedong's \\"Xiang-jiang River Commentary\\" magazine because of Mao's efforts to organize a movement to expel him from the governorship. Mao led a Hunan students' delegation to Peking, where he appealed nationwide for support and revealed Zhang Jingyao's atrocities in Hunan Province. At Yochow on June 16, 1920, Zhang's troops murdered an American missionary, William A. Reimert. This provoked the intervention of the American gunboat Upshur, which sent ashore a landing party of one officer and 40 men on June 25 to protect the American mission. Two days later—when local tensions had eased—they were re-embarked. On the 29th Jingyao was removed from office; the Chinese foreign office investigated the incident and expressed its profound regrets to the Americans. Zhang was later pardoned, in obscure circumstances. In 1933 Zhang became involved in the scheme of the Empire of Japan to set up the monarchy of Puyi in northern China with Japanese money.

Its chorus ends with a long list of the people travelling to the fair: \\"Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davy, Dan'l Whiddon, Harry Hawke, Old Uncle Tom Cobley and all.\\" Some research suggests that the names originally referred to real people. As the last name in a long list, \\"Uncle Tom Cobley and all\\" has come to be used as a humorous colloquialism meaning \\"anyone and everyone\\". The surname is spelt as \\"Cobleigh\\" in some references. ==History== The song was published by Sabine Baring-Gould in the book Songs and Ballads of the West (1889–91) (referring to the West Country in England), though it also exists in variant forms. The title is spelt \\"Widdecombe Fair\\" in the original publication, though \\"Widecombe\\" is now the standard spelling of the town Widecombe-in-the-Moor. The ghostly 'Grey Mare' of the song may in fact refer to a lost folk custom similar to the Mari Lwyd or Hobby Horse of Welsh and Cornish tradition. Local historians have tried to identify the characters in the song. Tony Beard, a member of the local history group that has researched the song says \\"I'm convinced the characters were real people\\", concluding that they are likely to have been inhabitants of the Spreyton area and that the song may commemorate an event that happened in 1802. A painted wooden sculpture depicting the horse and its riders is in Widecombe-in-the-Moor's St Pancras church. ==Versions== Mr Charles Tree, Baritone, recorded \\"Widdicombe Fair\\" (composer credit: \\"Heath\\") twice for the Gramophone Company (later labelled \\"His Master's Voice\\"), initially in October 1910. (He also recorded it for the foreign Favorite label (No.65046), as well as a shortened version for French Pathe (60171), about the same time). The original Gramophone Company recording of 1910 (12442e) was superseded in May 1915 with a new recording (HO 1522 ab) but keeping the same catalogue number (G.C.4-2123). A comic version with dramatic dialogue spoken by the characters, including Mrs Pearce, was recorded in 1930 by the Regal Dramatic players.Regal Records MR145, 1930 A review in Gramophone says it is \\"played with spirit and indeterminate dialect\\".Gramophone, October 1930 A straight version was also recorded by Raymond Newell. In 1932 Newell also appeared in Columbia on Parade, a record which included a version with other British singing stars at the time, who replaced the familiar list of names with their own.Columbia on Parade, in which Nineteen of Columbia's Greatest Artists and Bands provide a Unique Entertainment, CAX 6245 DX249 It was recorded by Burl Ives on 11 February 1941 for his debut album Okeh Presents the Wayfaring Stranger, introduced with a spoken explanation of the ghostly aspects of the song. Since then, it has been recorded by many others, including Paul Austin Kelly and Jon Pertwee in the persona of Worzel Gummidge. In a 1967 episode of the radio series Round the Horne, Kenneth Williams in character as Rambling Syd Rumpo performed a parody version called \\"Ganderpoke Bog\\" (introduced as \\"The Somerset Nog\\"), with the long list of people in the chorus being \\"Len Possett, Tim Screevy, The Reverend Phipps, Peg Leg Loombucket, Solly Levy, Ginger Epstein, Able Seaman Trufitt, Scotch Lil, Messrs Cattermole, Mousehabit, Neapthigh and Trusspot (solicitors and Commissioners for Oaths), Father Thunderghast, Fat Alice, Con Mahoney, Yeti Rosencrantz, Foo Too Robinson and Uncle Ted Willis and all\\". (Con Mahoney was at the time Head of the BBC Light Programme). George Adamson, who lived for many years in Devon, illustrated the song as a picture book for children with the title Widdecombe Fair. First published by Faber and Faber in 1966, Adamson later converted his drawings into a lively poster. \\"George Adamson has drawn a set of earthy characters to ride Tom Pearse's grey mare in the famous West Country song that are so obviously just right for their names. The colours are sombre, but there is humour and sly detail to delight an observant child.\\" The Tablet In 1964, The Nashville Teens released a rock version of the song - with abridged lyrics and new music - on their album Tobacco Road. A similar but much longer version was performed in 1970 by an early incarnation of Renaissance (some of whose members had previously been in The Nashville Teens) on a German TV program (Muzik-Kanal), as seen on the DVD \\"Kings & Queens\\" (released in 2010). In a 1973 episode of The Benny Hill Show, the fictional Dalton Abbott Railway Choir performed a parody of the song with the names in the chorus taken from the railway duty roster. Tavistock Goosey Fair composed in 1912 is likely influenced by Widecombe Fair. The Devon duo \\"Show of Hands\\" wrote a sinister ballad, also called \\"Widecombe Fair\\", about a young man who separates from his older companions and is murdered, which leaves off where the original folk song begins: \\"Tom, Tom, lend me your grey mare, I want to go back to Widecombe Fair...\\" ==The song lyrics, in full== Tom Pearce, Tom Pearce, lend me your grey mare.

He was an outspoken proponent of Southern emancipation of slaves. Following the war, Liddell had a prominent feud with a former Confederate officer, Charles Jones, who eventually murdered Liddell near his home in 1870. ==Early life== Liddell was born to a wealthy plantation family near Woodville, Mississippi. He was a schoolmate of future Confederate President Jefferson Davis, whom he would interact with several times during the early years of the Civil War on behalf of fellow general Albert Sidney Johnston. He attended the United States Military Academy from 1834 to 1835, but resigned prior to graduating. Liddell then moved to Catahoula Parish and established his own prosperous plantation, \\"Llanada,\\" near Harrisonburg, Louisiana. His famous feud with Charles Jones, known as the Jones-Liddell feud, which eventually led to his death, began in the 1850s. ==Civil WarWestern Theater: 1861-63=== With the outbreak of the Civil War and Louisiana's secession, Liddell enlisted in the Confederate States Army and received a commission. He initially served as a staff officer to his close friend William J. Hardee and Albert Sidney Johnston during the early part of the conflict. He then commanded the famous Arkansas Brigade in Patrick Cleburne's division of the Army of Tennessee from 1862-63, including the battles of Perryville and Murfreesboro. Liddell commanded a division at Chickamauga in 1863, but repeatedly refused promotion to Major General in order to secure an assignment closer to his plantation, which was in jeopardy from Jayhawkers. Liddell was approached by General Braxton Bragg, a West Point classmate, to become his Chief-of-Staff and replace General W.W. Mackall, but Liddell refused. Although he was publicly critical of Bragg, Liddell seemed to enjoy his favor, which may have earned him the enmity of several of the officers in the Army of Tennessee. He remained very close with his classmate Hardee. Despite his personal clashes with fellow officers, Liddell had provided invaluable service to the Army of Tennessee. His brigade was pivotal at Perryville and Stones' River (where his sixteen-year-old son Willie Liddell was mortally wounded), and suffered the highest percentage of casualties at Chickamauga. ===Trans-Mississippi Theater: 1863-65=== General Bragg refused to spare Liddell, but when Bragg was relieved by Jefferson Davis after the Chattanooga disaster, Liddell appealed personally to the President for a transfer and command of Sub-District of North Louisiana, which he received and held during the Red River Campaign in 1864. He was later assigned to overall command of the infantry at Mobile, Alabama until its surrender in 1865. During the last campaign, Liddell and Union Maj. Gen. E.R.S. Canby engaged in the Battle of Fort Blakely, one of the last engagements of the war, where he was captured. Canby would later prove influential in Liddell's life by securing amnesty for him from the Federal Government. During his Trans-Mississippi service, Liddell found himself in conflict with his immediate superior, Richard Taylor, the brother-in-law of President Davis, and regretted leaving the Army of Tennessee. In contrast to many modern historians, Liddell lays the blame for the Confederate failure to recapture the Mississippi or unite some 60,000 troops of their far Western Commands under Generals Magruder, Taylor, and Price with the Army of Tennessee on Taylor himself, rather than Edmund Kirby Smith. Unknown to Liddell, by late 1864 Generals Bragg, Hardee, and E.K. Smith made several petitions for Liddell's promotion to positions including James Mouton's Texas Division, and Hardee's Chief of Staff, but these were not acted on before the war drew to a close. ===Liddell on slavery=== Liddell held a reputation for being outspoken, and was well connected. In December 1864, he wrote a letter to Edward Sparrow, a Confederate Senator from Louisiana and chairman of the military Committee, expressing his conviction that the war was going against the Confederacy. He expressed the need for full emancipation of the slaves in order to secure foreign assistance. Although he admitted it may have been too late to act, he felt that emancipation may have also been a solution to the South's growing manpower crisis. Senator Sparrow showed the letter to General Robert E. Lee, who agreed with Liddell on all points, stating that \\"he could make soldiers out of any human being that had arms and legs.\\" ==Postbellum career== In 1866, Liddell wrote his memoirs, in which he was highly critical of the Confederate leadership and his fellow officers, including Davis and Bragg. The memoirs themselves are actually a collection of several separate manuscripts, letters, and battlefield records, which he was unable to combine before he was murdered. In them, his criticisms arise mainly from the failure of Bragg's subordinates, including Cleburne, Bishop Polk, John C. Breckinridge, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Joseph Wheeler, D.H. Hill, and James Longstreet, to support Bragg, which in the end leaves Liddell as one of the few writers of the period who was generous to Bragg. His writing reveals his minority opinion of praise for officers such as General John Floyd and Gideon Pillow, whom nearly all modern historians consider inept. He expresses disgust for Judah P. Benjamin, whom most historians consider one of the most able Confederate Cabinet officials. He mentions several times the growing sense of futility he and other officers felt in the unlucky Army of Tennessee. It was plainly clear to them after the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson that their cause was doomed unless they could concentrate their forces and wage an offensive campaign; however, political intrigue always seemed to squander any gains made by the army. Liddell comes off as a fair, impartial officer, even proposing that had the south recruited generals like George H. Thomas, whom he considered the best Union Commander, things may have turned out differently. Liddell refused promotion, and endeavored to help any officer he was assigned to, regardless of whether they were liked or not. He was opinionated and outspoken, yet his opinion was valued and he held the ear of the echelons of Confederate command, including Davis, A.S. Johnston, Bragg, and Hardee. He spent his vast personal fortune on equipping his own brigade, even though it was from a different state. The brigade itself was the only unit in the Army of Tennessee never to court-martial an enlisted soldier. Liddell was murdered in 1870 by Col. Charles Jones in the culmination of a twenty-year real estate dispute. He was buried on his sprawling plantation in Louisiana. The St. John Richardson Liddell Chapter #271 of the Military Order of the Stars & Bars in Bay Minette, Alabama, was named for the former general. ==See also== * List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) * Moses J.

In its prime, the Adelphi was one of thirteen in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood. Designed by John E.O. Pridmore, the Adelphi was an Art Deco-styled building, built in 1917 with a brick and terra-cotta edifice. It originally had seating in an auditorium slanted toward the screen for 1500 people. Famous Chicago artist, Ed Paschke was once a tenant in the second floor studio space. ==Vacant== Bill Morton, owner of 4x Records, moved to Rogers Park so that he could continue to work on his business and, while looking for space for his business, came upon the vacant theater. He became infatuated with the building and its history and worked out a deal with its owners so that his band and company could use the space while upgrading its interior. The mounting struggles to keep the building standing soon became evident and Bill Morton started his first not for profit organization, Citizens for the Adelphi Theater. There was much support for Citizens for the Adelphi Theater to raise funds and renovate the beautiful, architecturally sound building. ==Demolition== Alderman Joe Moore, however, agreed to the sale and demolition of the building so that condominiums could be built in its place. The owner of the construction company working on the project did not have financial stability, however, and his company went bankrupt just after the foundation for the condos was put in. The community members of Rogers Park now call it \\"A hole of a Mess\\" when once it was a beautiful landmark with much promise. ==References== * Chi-Town Daily News article about Bill Mortons attempt to save the Adelphi Theater * Chicago Reader article about Bill Mortons attempt to save the Adelphi Theater Category:Organizations based in Chicago ","title":"Citizens for the Adelphi Theater"},{"id":"9086729","text":"Kram may refer to: * KRAM, a radio station (1070 AM) licensed to serve West Klamath, Oregon, United States * Kram (musician), the stage name for Mark Maher, a member of Australian band Spiderbait * Kram (novel), a novel by Hans- Eric Hellberg * Kram, a term for surnames among Kashmiris == See also == * * Le Kram, a town in Tunisia * Cram (disambiguation) * Karm (disambiguation) ","title":"Kram"},{"id":"9086735","text":"The Chautauqua adult education movement flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then declined.

He used the French name L'ortolan du Cap de Bonne Espérance and the Latin Hortulanus capitis bonae spei. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Cape bunting. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Emberiza capensis and cited Brisson's work. Linnaeus had introduced the genus Emberiza in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. The specific name capensis is used to denote the Cape of Good Hope. There are a ten subspecies. They differ in plumage, but all have the distinctive head pattern and rufous in the wings. The north-eastern race E. c. vincenti is very dark above, and slaty below. It has reduced chestnut on the wing coverts. It is now usually raised to species status as Vincent's bunting, Emberiza vincenti, however some taxonomists still consider it to be conspecific. ==Description== The Cape bunting is 16 cm long. The adult has a black crown, white supercilium and black-bordered white ear coverts. The upperparts are grey brown with some dark streaks, and the wing coverts are chestnut. The tail is darker chestnut, and the underparts are grey with a pale throat. The sexes are very similar, but females may have a buff tone to the white head markings. Young birds have duller chestnut wings, a less distinct head pattern, and heavier streaking extending on to the breast and flanks. The call is an ascending zzoo-zeh-zee-zee. The song is a loud chirping chup chup chup chup chee chhep chu. E. c. vincenti has a simple tre-re-ret tre-re-ret song. ==Distribution and habitat== The Cape bunting occurs in southern Africa from south-western Angola, eastern Zambia, Zimbabwe and southern Tanzania to the Cape. Its habitat is rocky slopes and dry weedy scrub, mainly in mountains in the north of its range. It previously utilized stony arid areas with some short grass, but much of this has been lost to ploughing. ==Behaviour== The Cape bunting is not gregarious, and is normally seen alone, in pairs or family groups. It feeds on the ground on seeds, insects and spiders. Its lined cup nest is built low in a shrub or tussock. The two to four eggs are cream and marked with red-brown and lilac. ==References== * Byers, Olsson and Curson, Buntings and Sparrows * Ian Sinclair, Phil Hockey and Warwick Tarboton, SASOL Birds of Southern Africa (Struik 2002) ==External links== * Cape bunting - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.

He had begun his noviciate in Vienna and entered the Franciscan order, taking the name Petar. He completed his theological studies in Osijek, and his philosophical studies, aesthetics and poetics, in Budim. He worked for 10 years as a professor in Osijek, and when the Germanization wave strongly hit the Osijek grammar school (in 1788), he left for Zagreb where he started keeping company with the Bishop of Zagreb, Maksimilijan Vrhovac. He was later elected professor of archaeology and numismatics in Budim (1795), but on account of bad health he had to stop teaching in 1800, in order to dedicate himself to science and also to the translation of the Bible into Croatian. In 1817 he wrote the \\"Booklet on Illyrian poetry\\" - De poesi Illyrica libellus, in which he tried to justify and explain his poetic starting position. He also published a number of very important books from the area of ancient archaeology in Panonia (Slavonia). Katančić died in Budim. His work that is of utmost importance for the Croatian literature and culture is his translation of the complete Bible in six big volumes, the Old and the New Testament, published after his death, in Budim in 1831. He is also the author of two unfinished dictionaries, the huge semantic-etymological law dictionary, and the Latin-Croatian Etymologicon illyricum. Though some of his huge opus remained unfinished and incomplete, Katančić's conception of the indigenousness of Croats (Illyrians) and his texts written in the fully formed Štokavian-ikavian dialect of the Croatian language made a strong impact on the Croatian national revival. ==References== * Biography of Matija Petar Katancic at Hrvatska pošta Category:1750 births Category:1825 deaths Category:People from Valpovo Category:Croatian Roman Catholic priests Category:Croatian writers Category:Croatian lexicographers ","title":"Matija Petar Katančić"},{"id":"9086937","text":"Bantumilli is a village in the Krishna district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

It is supported by Nestrans, the north-east of Scotland's voluntary regional transport partnership. Crossrail aims to provide a frequent, cross-city rail service between Inverurie, Aberdeen and Stonehaven, coupled with new stations. It proposed upgrading existing train services from Aberdeen to Inverurie to a regular half-hourly service, adding more services between Aberdeen and Stonehaven, and opening new stations along existing lines in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It could also bring about the re-opening of lines and stations between Aberdeen and the towns of Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Banchory. The project is seen as vital in reducing traffic congestion within Aberdeen. Currently, only 12% of north-east residents live within 1 km of a railway station, but if all of the Crossrail proposals were to go ahead, this could rise to 25%. This would aid commuting into the city centre and provide a viable alternative to using the car. ==Feasibility study== The Scottish Executive began a £400,000 feasibility study into the project in June 2005, the outcome of which was expected to be announced by March 2007. This feasibility study into the project indicated that Crossrail could best be delivered on an incremental basis. Nestrans' Draft Rail Action Plan 2010-2021 considered how to achieve frequency and service improvements in the short term, leading to the opening of new stations - such as at Kintore - and more significant service enhancements over time. Laurencekirk Station was re-opened on 18 May 2009. Network Rail has completed a GRIP2 study to investigate options for Aberdeen - Inverness line improvements, including consideration of a new station at Kintore. The report was published on the Transport Scotland website on 22 March 2011. This confirmed that an hourly service frequency and two hour journey time would be feasible. The Stage 3 study examining the range of options in greater detail is underway and is expected to be completed during 2012. ==Implementation== Transport Scotland announced in March 2016 that the scheme will go ahead as part of a wider timetable recast in 2018. The new service will run between Inverurie and , serving all existing intermediate stations and one at from 2019 (now rescheduled to May 2020). The Aberdeen to Inverurie section will then have a 30-minute interval service in operation. Infrastructure enhancements on the Aberdeen to Inverness line (including the redoubling of track from Aberdeen to Inverurie) are also scheduled to be completed by this time, as part of a £170 million route upgrade project. ==See also== *Edinburgh Crossrail *Crossrail Glasgow == References == Category:Transport in Aberdeen Category:Proposed railway lines in Scotland Category:Stonehaven Category:Transport in Aberdeenshire Category:Inverurie ","title":"Aberdeen Crossrail"},{"id":"9087018","text":"A bamboo hanakago with an ikebana flower arrangement by the 40th headmaster Ikenobō Senjō (from the Sōka Hyakki, 1820) Hanakago (花籠) is a Japanese language term and means \\"flower basket\\".

He left home in 1984, at the age of 13 to pursue a childhood dream. ==Biography== Lee was the youngest son of a grocery shop owner. In his young mind, he had just wished to work in an air-conditioned workplace where he didn't have to sweat and with nice clothes to wear. In 1990, at the age of 19, he left his hometown in Penang, Malaysia and went to Singapore in search for that dream. For three years, he moved from one hair salon to another, gaining work experience in both the creative art of hairdressing and the competencies of running a hair salon business. Lee is, today a famed name in Singapore. He has worked on his portfolio on from TV, print commercials, hairshows, seminars workshops and local artistes like Michelle Chia, Joanne Peh, Quan Yi Fong, Mark Lee, Bryan Wong and more. Lee has opened salons in Singapore and Malaysia, and the Monsoon Hair Academy in January 2007 to coach trainees who wish to establish a career in the hairdressing and hairstyling. ==References== Category:Hairdressers Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Penang Category:Singaporean television personalities Category:Malaysian people of Chinese descent Category:Malaysian emigrants to Singapore ","title":"Addy Lee"},{"id":"9087155","text":"Francis Mer (born 25 May 1939, in Pau) is a French businessman, industrialist and politician.

Early in school, she developed a fondness for classical music, particularly Beethoven, though she also cites the Beatles, Pablo Casals, and her grandfather as influences. Her grandfather sang with Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, and her mother sang opera. Massé started on piano, played cello in her teens, and was her own teacher on guitar during the 1960s. She sang in the choir and belonged to rock bands in high school. She was unfamiliar with jazz until the age of 20. In 1972, Massé was working as a waitress in New York City when she stepped into a taxi driven by Tim Hauser. Massé and Hauser had the same ambition to be singers. Hauser had formed a vocal group, the Manhattan Transfer, which broke up after recording one album. Some weeks later, one of Hauser's passengers took him to a party where he met Janis Siegel, another aspiring singer. Then he was introduced to Alan Paul, and the quartet was complete. Massé's background in multiple genres fit the Manhattan Transfer's repertoire of jazzy pop, rock, and swing. With the Manhattan Transfer, Massé toured worldwide, appeared on TV, and sold millions of albums until a car accident in 1979. Unhappy with life in the group, she considered the accident a providential opportunity to start a solo career. In 1981, she moved to Chicago, and with the help of Judy Roberts, a singer and pianist, she returned to singing in clubs. She recorded her first solo album, Alone Together (Pausa, 1984), and toured in the U.S. and Canada. During the 1990s, Massé lived near the Adirondack Mountains in New York, concentrating on classical and Celtic music. In 1997, she started teaching at the Ashokan Music and Dance Camp, and in 2004 at the International Cabaret Conference at Yale University. She has also taught at Dartmouth College and the Royal Academy of Music in England. She has been a soloist and member of the choir of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. ==Awards== * MAC Lifetime Achievement Award, 2004 * Bistro Best Jazz Vocalist, 2009 ==Discography== * Alone Together (Pausa, 1984) * Easy Living (Pausa, 1986) * Again (Disques Beaupré, 1990) * Feather & Bone (Premonition, 2001) * That Old Mercer Magic with Janis Siegel and Lauren Kinhan as Jalala (Dare, 2009) * Once in a Million Moons with Tex Arnold (2012) With The Manhattan Transfer * The Manhattan Transfer (1975) * Coming Out (1976) * Pastiche (1977) * The Manhattan Transfer Live (1978) With others * Tim Curry, Simplicity (1981) * Carol Hall, Hallways: The Songs of Carol Hall, (2008) * Barry Manilow, Barry Manilow (1973) * Tim Moore, White Shadows (1977) * Professor Louie, Flyin' High (2002) * Layne Redmond, Invoking the Muse (2004) * Tony Trischka, New Deal (2003) ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:1954 births Category:American female jazz singers Category:American jazz singers Category:The Manhattan Transfer members Category:Pausa Records artists Category:Living people ","title":"Laurel Massé"},{"id":"9087191","text":"Artus Quellinus also known as Artus (Arnoldus) Quellijn, Artus Quellinus I or Artus Quellinus the Elder (20 or 30 August 1609, Antwerp – 23 August 1668, Antwerp) was a Flemish sculptor.

Web. 25 Mar. 2014 ==Life== Artus Quellinus the Elder was born into an artistic family. He was the son of the respected Antwerp sculptor Erasmus Quellinus I and Elisabeth van Uden.Biographical details at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His brothers became prominent artists: Erasmus was a painter and Hubertus was an engraver and painter. His sister Cornelia married his father's pupil, the sculptor Pieter Verbrugghen the Elder.Hans Vlieghe and iris Kockelbergh. \\"Erasmus Quellinus I\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. March 23. 2014 Mercury, Amsterdam city hall Artus Quellinus received his first training from his father.Matthias Depoorter, Artus Quellinus I at: Baroque in the Southern Netherlands In the period from 1635 to 1639 he trained in Rome in the studio of his compatriot François Duquesnoy. He spent time in Lyon together with the Flemish painter Laureys Franck and was in contact there with the Dutch engraver Nicolaas van Helt Stockade and the Dutch painter Jan Asselijn. He returned to Antwerp in 1639 and became member of the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1640–41. In 1640 he took over the workshop of his father and married Marguerite Verdussen (she died on 12 February 1668). He worked in Amsterdam in the years 1646 and 1647 and also spent time in Sweden. Vierschaar, Amsterdam city hall He won commissions in Amsterdam and, from 1650 onwards, worked for fifteen years on the new city hall together with the lead architect Jacob van Campen. Now called the Royal Palace on the Dam, this construction project, and in particular the marble decorations he and his workshop produced, became an example for other buildings in Amsterdam. The team of sculptors that Artus supervised during his work on the Amsterdam city hall included many sculptors who would become leading sculptors in their own right such as his cousin Artus Quellinus II, Rombout Verhulst, and Gabriël Grupello and probably also Grinling Gibbons.Geoffrey Beard. \\"Gibbons, Grinling.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 March 2014Kai Budde. \\"Grupello, Gabriel.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 March 2014 He returned to work in Antwerp in 1658 and remained active mainly in this city until his death. His many pupils included his cousin Artus Quellinus II, Martin Deurweerders, Grinling Gibbons, Gabriël Grupello, Pieter Verbrugghen I, Lodewijk Willemsens, Jackes Janssen (1641-42); Hendricus Quellinus (1643-44); Hubertus Daep (1651-52); Aurelius Gompaert (1651-52); Gabriël Grupello (1658-69); Jan Bouttil (1660-61); Lodewyk Willemsen (1661-62); Jasper van Steen (1664-65); Lambertus Lowies (1666-67) and Dirick Willekens van Werelt (1667-68). Many of these students would become leading sculptors in their own right who would help spread the late Baroque style across Europe. ==WorkGeneral=== Bust of Andries de Graeff, 1661 Artus Quellinus brought the classicizing Baroque style of François Duquesnoy (the so-called la gran maniera greca) to his native Antwerp on his return from Rome in 1639.François Duquesnoy and the Greek Ideal, by Estelle Lingo, 2007, He thus introduced into Flemish sculpture the Baroque style developed by François Duquesnoy, which was based on classical sculpture.Helena Bussers, De baroksculptuur en het barok at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen This style was less expressive than the Baroque style of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the main competitor of François Duquesnoy in Rome. Another influence on his work that mitigated Dusquesnoy's clacissistic tendencies was the realism of Johannes van Mildert and Lucas Faydherbe, two sculptors who had worked closely with Peter Paul Rubens. As Artus Quellinus I mainly worked on monumental commissions, most of his work is to be found in situ with as principal locations the cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam. Artus Quellinus I also produced small-scale sculptures such as ivory-carvings. ===Amsterdam city hall=== His work on the city hall of Amsterdam was very influential. It was popularised by his brother Hubertus, who engraved many of his works in the city hall and published a book of these together with 30 architectural drawings by van Campen in 1665.Afbeelding van 't stadt huys van Amsterdam : in dartigh coopere plaaten (Images of the City Hall of Amsterdam in 30 engravings), by Jacob van Campen & drawings by Jacob Vennekool; followed by De voornaemste statuen ende ciraten vant konstrijck stadthuys van Amstelredam, tmeeste in marmer gemaeckt door Artus Quellinus (The main statuary and reliefs of the Amsterdam City Hall by Artus Quellinus) – digitized courtesy of Tresoar, the Frisian Historic and Literary Center in Leeuwarden One particular feature of the city hall, the so-called vierschaar or tribunal, reflected the fashion of the period and, in particular, the ideals of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio and his pupils Vincenzo Scamozzi and Cesare Ripa. An exhibition was held, focusing on the work of Quellinus, from June to September 1977. ===Funerary monuments=== In the Dutch Republic Artus Quellinus I was further noted for funerary monuments and portrait busts. His monumental tomb for Otto Christoph von Sparr, Generalfeldmarschall of Brandenburg-Prussia, in the St. Mary's Church, Berlin had an important influence on the development of tomb sculpture in Northern Germany. Another tomb monument he made in Germany was that for Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp in Schleswig Cathedral.Regina Bartsch-Molden: Artus Quellinus' Grabmal Sparr. Der Einfluß der Niederlande auf das Grabmal in Norddeutschland zwischen 1650 und 1725. PEter LAng Verlag, FrankfurtM. 1993, (zugl. Dissertation FU Berlin 1992). ===Portrait sculpture=== Artus Quellinus I made an important contribution to Dutch portrait sculpture through a series of portraits of leading citizens such as the Burgomasters of Amsterdam, their wives and, in particular, a bust of the Grand Pensionary of Holland, Johan de Witt. The portraits combine the classical style with late Baroque devices such as the inclusion of the arms of the sitter. His sculptures were so popular in Amsterdam that the leading Dutch writers Joost van den Vondel and Jan Vos dedicated poems to his work.

By the time of the 2011 Census the village was a ward of Swadlincote, of which it is now effectively a suburb, and the population of Church Gresley ward was 6,881. The village forms part of the border with Leicestershire to the southeast. Nearby villages include Castle Gresley, Albert Village, Linton and Overseal. ==History== Gresele is recorded in the Domesday Book. Its first element is of uncertain origin, possibly the Old English grēosn meaning gravel and lēah meaning a woodland clearing. Churchegreseleye was first recorded in 1363 and distinguishes it from Castle Gresley. ===Priory and church=== See also Gresley Priory A priory of Augustinian canons was founded at Gresley in the reign of Henry I, by William de Gresley, son of Nigel de Stafford. It was suppressed in 1536 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Church of England parish church of Saint George and Saint Mary was built early in the 12th century as the priory's conventual church. Of the 12th century building only the lower part of the tower survives. In about 1820 the church and the upper part of the tower were rebuilt. The chancel was designed by Arthur Blomfield and built in 1872. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The tower has a ring of six bells. The fourth bell was cast by Henry Oldfield of Nottingham. Its date is unknown, but is known that Oldfield was casting bells between 1590 and 1620. George Oldfield of Nottingham cast the fifth and tenor bells in 1639. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast or recast the second and third bells in 1958 and cast the present treble bell in 1991. ===Economic and social history=== T G Green & Co Ltd back stamp showing St George & St Mary church In about 1800 the Mason pottery was founded at Church Gresley.

He led the Bulgarian forces during the successful defensive operation at Dojran during the First World War. ==Biography== Vladimir Vazov was born on May 14, 1868 to Mincho Vazov and Suba Hadjinikolova. His brothers were the writer Ivan Vazov, the officer Georgi Vazov and the politician Boris Vazov. In 1886 Vladimir Vazov entered the Military School in Sofia. After he graduated in 1888 he was assigned as a second lieutenant to the 5th artillery regiment in Shumen. On 18 May 1890 Vladimir was promoted to lieutenant and continued his specialization in Hessen, Germany. On 2 August 1894 he received the rank of captain and in 1896 was transferred to the 4th Artillery Regiment in Sofia and served as the commander of an artillery battery. During 1902 and 1903 he attended Artillery School in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia. In 1904 Vladimir was part of a special Bulgarian delegation which visited France and Germany to assess the capabilities of their newest artillery equipment and choose a supplier for the Bulgarian Army. On 17 February 1906 the minister of war decreed the establishment of a special Artillery School in Sofia and Vladimir Vazov was assigned as its assistant principal. On 31 December 1906 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1909 he was the commander of an artillery section in the 4th Artillery Regiment but was soon made a brigade commander. ==Balkan Wars== During the First Balkan War Vladimir Vazov served as commander of the 4th Quick-Firing Artillery Regiment of the 1st Sofia Infantry Division. When war was declared on 5 October 1912 some 21 officers and 1168 soldiers were serving in his regiment. On 9 October Vazov fought around the village of Geçkinli where the Bulgarians defeated the Ottomans despite the latter's sizable numerical advantage. After that he took part in the Battle of Kirk Kilisse and later fought in the First Battle of Çatalca. During the Second Balkan War Vladimir retained the command of his regiment and participated in the fighting around Tsaribrod, Pirot, Bubliak and Gradoman. ==First World War== By August 1915 lieutenant colonel Vazov was serving as commander of the 5th Division's artillery brigade.Вазов. Животописни бележки p. 11 In October of the same year the division was subordinated to the Bulgarian 2nd Army which was conducting operations against the Serbians in Vardar Macedonia. Here the lieutenant-colonel and his brigade took part in the heavy fighting around the town of Gnjilane, during the Battle of Kosovo. With the final defeat of the Serbian army in November the 5th Division was turned south to face the French forces advancing up the river Vardar. On 28 November Vazov was severely wounded and forced to take leave from active frontal duties during the next several months. Soon afterwards he was promoted to colonel. In 1916 he was made commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 5th Division and successfully led it in action against Allies during their Autumn Offensive on the Macedonian front. On 1 March 1917 he took the command of the 9th Pleven Infantry Division which was part of the First Bulgarian Army. Beginning in 1916 the division occupied a stretch of the Macedonian front between the river Vardar and lake Dojran. As soon as he was appointed he inspected the entire section of the front that was under his command and took measures to strengthen and fortify it. Under his guidance the forced were deployed in order to create a defence in depth. His efforts to improve the positions were soon tested during the Second Battle of Doiran between 22 and 26 April 1917. Some 86 heavy and 74 field British guns bombarded the line with more than 100,000 shells but caused insignificant damage and the following infantry attack suffered a heavy defeat. In early May the British resumed their assault but were again defeated and suffered heavy casualties. Following this attack the Bulgarian 34th Troyan Regiment alone buried the bodies of some 2,290 Allied officers and soldiers. Due to his significant contribution for the victory on 20 of May 1917 Vladimir Vazov was promoted to major general. Lieutenant General Vladimir Vazov. The location of the Doiran Sector was crucial as it represented the shortest possible route to the valley of the Vardar and during the summer of 1918 its defence was expanded to consist of 4 lines arrayed in depth. Hence it was much better prepared to face an attack than the previous year. When the Allied Vardar Offensive began the British and two Greek divisions once again attacked the 9th Pleven Division at Doiran. During this Third Battle of Doiran the Allies once again enjoyed significant advantage in firepower and manpower, being able to bombard the Bulgarian position with over 300,000 ordinary and gas shells. Despite this the damage to the fortifications was limited and the fighting again resulted in a decisive Bulgarian victory. According to official British sources the Allied losses totalled just over 7,000. Bulgarian sources however report a figure of over 11,000. The Bulgarian and German commanders on the Macedonian front were not able to fully use the results of the decisive victory at Doiran to their advantage and Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29 September 1918 thus ending its participation in the First World War. On February 24, 1920 lieutenant- general Vazov went into the reserve. In 1926 he became mayor of Sofia. During his mandate (until 1932) the fire department was reformed, the electrical network expanded, and the public transport improved. Sofia became one of the “greenest” capitals in Europe. Among the most notable moments of Vladimir Vazov’s life was his visit to England in 1936. The British legion celebrated the British victory in World War I. The British veterans invited one of their worthiest opponents on the battlefield. He was personally greeted by Lord Milne, who shook his hand with the words \\"It is a pleasure to meet the Bulgarian delegation, as even though we were enemies, you - like us - fought not only like brave men, but also like gentlemen.\\" The British paid great honour to General Vazov as they lowered their national flags in his name. The chairman of the British legion Major Goldy said in his speech: “He is one of the few foreign officers whose name features in our history”. The last years of his life were spent in the village of Ribaritsa (near Lovech), where he died in 1945. ==See also== *List of Bulgarian generals in the Kingdom of Bulgaria ==References== ==External links== *General Vazov in the Great Bulgarians list ==Sources== * * Gen.

Gandhian socialism generally centers on Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule authored by Gandhi. Federation of political and economical power and demonstrating a traditionalist reluctance towards the modernisation of technology and large scale industrialisation whilst emphasising self-employment and self-reliance are key features of Gandhian socialism. Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and other party leaders incorporated Gandhian socialism as one of the concepts for the party. ==Etymology== The ideology of Gandhian socialism is rooted in Gandhi's work titled Swaraj and India of My Dreams in which, he describes Indian society, with no one rich or poor, no class conflict, where there is an equal distribution of the resources, and self-sufficient economy without any exploitation and violence. Thus, Gandhian socialism differed from Western socialism because the latter believed in material progress whereas Gandhi considered every one materially equal. As Jawahar Lal Nehru puts in his biography, \\"he suspects also socialism, and more particularly Marxism, because of their association with violence.\\" He believed his style of socialism came from the strong beliefs he held in non-violence and not those adopted from any books. Many experts observed that, similar to other schools of socialism, Gandhi's concept of socialism was a result of ethical considerations, but had nothing to do with class-consciousness as professed by the western socialism. There was also a religious aspect of Gandhi's socialism. To understand Gandhi's socialist philosophy, as Romain Rolland observed; \\"it should be realized that his doctrine is like a huge edifice composed of two different floors or grades. Below is the solid groundwork, the basic foundation of religion. On this vast and unshakable foundation is based the political and social campaign.\\" ==Economic philosophy== The key aspects of the economic policies of Gandhian socialism are based on ethics. According to Gandhi: \\"Economics that hurts the moral well-being of a human or a nation is immoral and, therefore sinful\\". Hence, Gandhian socialism roots for economic social justice by promoting equality for all. Evolving from this ideology, the economic components of Gandhian socialism are centered around Swaraj, resulting from complete economic freedom. This is achieved through self- sufficiency and self-reliance, where, everyone gets an appropriate share of his labor. Therefore, Gandhian socialism advocates a society without economic classes, which Gandhi termed it as Sarvodaya. An example of this concept can be seen in the implementation of Panchayat Raj in India. In 1938, during the formulation of an economic plan for the post-independent India, it was noted that the planning under a democratic India should be based not only on raising the standard of living by copying various socialist, capitalist, or a fascist nation's plan, but it should be centered towards its roots firm in Indian soil and India's problems. ==See also== * Gandhian economics ==Further reading== * Shourie, Arun (1990).

Made by the BBC, it was adapted by Frederic Raphael, directed by Clive Donner and also stars Alastair Sim, John Standing and Harold Pinter. It was first transmitted on 22 September 1976. ==Plot== In early 1939, before the start of the Second World War, Sir Robert Hunter (O'Toole) takes aim at Adolf Hitler with a hunting rifle, but hesitates to shoot and is spotted and tackled by a Schutzstaffel (SS) guard. Captured and tortured by the Gestapo, he is left for dead but manages, with the aid of a friendly sailor, to make his way back to England. He discovers that German agents are after him and believes that the government would turn him over to German authorities. Sir Robert goes underground, literally, to escape his pursuers, who are intent on getting him to sign a false confession that he attempted to assassinate Hitler while working for British intelligence. ==Cast== * Peter O'Toole as Sir Robert Hunter * John Standing as Major Quive- Smith * Alastair Sim as The Earl * Harold Pinter as Saul Abrahams * Michael Byrne as Interrogator * Mark McManus as Vane * Ray Smith as Fisherman * Hugh Manning as Peale * Robert Lang as Jessel * Cyd Hayman as Rebecca * Ian East as Muller * Philip Jackson as 1st Seaman * Nicholas Ball as 2nd Seaman * Maureen Lipman as Freda * Ray Mort as Gerald * Michael Sheard as Hitler * Shirley Dynevor as Eva Braun * Ivor Roberts as Drake * John Ringham as SS Officer ==Background== The novel had been filmed in 1941 by Fritz Lang, as Man Hunt, with Walter Pidgeon in the lead role. According to producer Mark Shivas, script editor Richard Broke had the idea of making six TV movie thrillers for the BBC which showed the changing nature of the British hero from 1918 to 1939, with Rogue Male to be the last. Shivas was then working on an adaptation of The Glittering Prizes with writer Frederic Raphael and commissioned him to adapt Rogue Male. Raphael went back to the novel and ignored the 1941 film. Shivas felt there were three things any version of Rogue Male had to have, the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the story, the chase on the London Underground and the battle underground at the end. Filming took 25 days and involved 29 locations.Television: An Interview with Mark Shivas Hodgson, Clive. London Magazine18.1 (Apr 1, 1978): 68. Shivas would make two others in the series, She Fell Among Thieves and The Three Hostages. Interviewed by the Radio Times for the first screening of the film, Household acknowledged that he always intended the protagonist's target to be Hitler, \\"Although the idea for Rogue Male germinated from my intense dislike of Hitler, I did not actually name him in the book as things were a bit tricky at the time and I thought I would leave it open so that the target could be either Hitler or Stalin. You could take your pick\\".Radio Times, 18–24 September 1976, page 4. It was reported that Peter O'Toole had agreed to be cast in Rogue Male partly because the original novel was a favourite of his wife Sian Phillips. ==Production== Some of the filming took place around King's Stag in Dorset, including the area around a local pub, the \\"Green Man\\". As a TV production, the film was made on a relatively tight budget and the crew was paid at the lower rates applicable to TV productions. == Release and reception == Despite its low budget, the finished film was regarded by the BBC as being suitable for a cinema release internationally. This had the potential to cause legal and industrial problems in the UK, because the crew had not been paid at the rate applicable to cinema releases. The BBC decided to terminate screenings in the UK and disallow future screenings in the UK. In an interview with Francine Stock for BBC Radio 4's Film Programme in 2007, Peter O'Toole named the film as his favourite among those that he had made. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 television films Category:British television films Category:BBC television dramas Category:Films about assassinations Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Clive Donner Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler Category:Films set in Germany Category:British films ","title":"Rogue Male (1976 film)"},{"id":"9087562","text":"The Aldranser Bach is a small river at Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria.

Her training as an artist began in 1781 under Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, and she entered Jacques-Louis David's atelier in 1786 along with her sister Marie-Élisabeth Laville-Leroux. The poet Charles-Albert Demoustier, who met her in 1784, was inspired by her in creating the character Émilie in his work Lettres à Émilie sur la mythologie (1801). In 1791 she exhibited for the first time in the Salon de Paris, displaying her mythology-inspired picture Psyché faisant ses adieux à sa famille. Another of her paintings of this period, L'Innocence entre la vertu et le vice, is similarly mythological and reveals her feminist interests—in this picture, vice is represented by a man, although it was traditionally represented by a woman. In 1793, she married the lawyer Pierre-Vincent Benoist. Her work, reflecting the influence of Jacques-Louis David, tended increasingly toward history painting by 1795. In 1800, she exhibited Portrait d'une négresse (as of 2019 renamed \\"Portrait to Madeleine\\") in the Salon. Six years previously, slavery had been abolished, and this image became a symbol for women's emancipation and black people's rights. The picture was acquired by Louis XVIII for France in 1818. Elisa Bonaparte, Emperor Napoleon's sister and Duchess of Lucca, painted by Marie-Guillemine Benoist about 1805 An important commission for a full-length portrait of Napoléon Bonaparte—Premier Consul Français in this period—was awarded to her in 1803. This portrait was to be sent to the city of Ghent, newly ceded to France by the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801. Other honors came to her; she was awarded a Gold Medal in the Salon of 1804, and received a governmental allowance. During this time she opened an atelier for the artistic training of women. Her career was harmed by political developments, however, when her husband, the supporter of royalist causes, Comte Benoist, was nominated in the Conseil d'État during the post-1814 Bourbon Restoration. Despite being at the height of her popularity, \\"she was obliged to abandon painting\\" and pursuing women's causes, due in part to her devoir de réserve or \\"tactful withdrawal\\" in English, in the face of the growing wave of conservatism in European society. ==Works== * Psyché faisant ses adieux a sa famille (1791) * L'Innocence entre la vertu et le vice *Portrait of Madeleine (previously known as Portrait d’une négresse (1800, Musée du Louvre)) * Portrait Madame Philippe Panon Debassayns de Richmont and Her Son Eugene (1802, Metropolitan Museum of Art) * Portrait de Napoléon (1804, court of Ghent) * Portrait du Maréchal Brune (1805, détruit ; une copie se trouve au Musée du Château de Versailles) * Portrait de Pauline Borghèse (1807, Musée du Château de Versailles) * Portrait de Marie-Élise, grande duchesse de Toscane (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Lucca) * Portrait de l’impératrice Marie-Louise (Château de Fontainebleau) * La lecture de la Bible, (1810, musée municipal, Louviers) * La Consultation ou La Diseuse de bonne-aventure, Saintes Musée municipal. ==See also== *:fr:Devoir de réserve dans la fonction publique française ==References== ==Bibliography== *Marie-Juliette Ballot, Une élève de David, La Comtesse Benoist, L'Émilie de Demoustier, 1768-1826, Plon, Paris, 1914 *Astrid Reuter, Marie-Guilhelmine Benoist, Gestaltungsräume einer Künstlerin um 1800, Lukas Verlag, Berlin, 2002 ==External links== * James Smalls, Slavery is a Woman: \\"Race,\\" Gender, and Visuality in Marie Benoist's Portrait d'une négresse. * Marie-Guillemine Benoist dans Artcyclopedia * Online pictures on Artnet Category:1768 births Category:1826 deaths Category:French women painters Category:French genre painters Category:French portrait painters Category:French neoclassical painters Category:Pupils of Jacques-Louis David Category:18th-century French painters Category:19th-century French painters Category:19th-century painters of historical subjects Category:19th-century French women artists Category:18th- century women artists Category:Artists from Paris ","title":"Marie-Guillemine Benoist"},{"id":"9087582","text":"Ilivasi Sevia Tabua Tamanivalu (born 30 September 1964 in Naivicula) is a Fijian former rugby union footballer who played at international level for both Fiji and Australia as a flanker.

The company was founded in 1959 by mining engineer Rudolph J. \\"Rudy\\" Enstrom, initially as the R.J. Enstrom Corp. ==History== Enstrom began by attempting to design his own helicopter. His lack of training in this area meant that his first efforts were not outstanding, but his efforts were noticed by local Upper Peninsula businessmen, who decided to back him.Stephen Pope, Enstrom 480B, Flying, September 2011, pp. 60-65 They recruited several experienced aeronautical engineers, and the group was incorporated as the R.J. Enstrom Co. (1959). The company's first product was the piston-powered F-28 (1965). However, Enstrom had been removed from the company before that product came onto the market, although the company continued to carry his name.Enstrom was self-employed as a heating contractor for 10 years after leaving the company that he helped to create. In 1979 he was named Chief Engineer of Hillman Helicopter (Phoenix, Arizona), but that company folded a few years later when its founder, Douglas Hillman, was killed while flying a test helicopter. Enstrom continued working on individual projects, but did not produce another marketable product. He died in 2007. (from Flying p. 63-64) In October 1968, a controlling interest in Enstrom was bought by Purex Industries, who wanted to develop a turbine powered version, a project that was not completed until over 20 years later. The lack of success with this venture led the piston engine variants to languish and the Purex stake was bought by F. Lee Bailey, a well-known American criminal defense attorney, in January 1971, changing to the current name.Enstrom Website Bailey was an enthusiastic entrepreneur and soon had the factory producing over a hundred units per year. He also orchestrated the development and certification of the 280 Shark, which was introduced to the market in 1974. It was an immediate sales success.Flying, p. 64 Encouraged, Bailey embarked the design of a four- place stretched version of the Shark (designated 280L Hawk), but the combination of technical problems with this development and a cooling economy drained the company's financial reserves, and Bailey sold the company in 1979. Since then it has changed hands several times. Owners have included Victor Kiam and Dean Kamen, developer of the Segway PT people-mover.November 2008 Esquire Kamen worked to improve the company's existing products and to introduce the turbine-powered 480, which was originally developed as a response to a request for bids on a military training helicopter.The proposed military trainer would have been designated TH28. The company's proposal was not successful; Bell Helicopter won the bid. (Flying, p. 65) The company was sold to an unnamed Swiss investor in 2000; Kamen remained with the company as an advisor. In January 2013 the company was purchased by the Chongqing Helicopter Investment Corporation of the People's Republic of China. Jerry M. Mullins was president and CEO of Heli-Dyne Systems Inc. in Hurst, Texas before he succeeded the former CEO Peter Parsinen. Since delivering their first helicopter shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration type certification of the F-28 model in April 1965, Enstrom produced over 1,100 helicopters, up to July 2011.Flying, p. 63 However, the Great Recession considerably slowed its output; it built only six units in 2010. By early 2013 the company was expanding, having increased its Michigan workforce by 50% and planned to expand its physical facilities, due to increased sales, mostly in Asia. The company produces three models, the F-28, the more aerodynamic 280 and the turbine-engined 480, each with their own variants. The F-28 and 280 are powered by Lycoming piston engines similar to those found in general aviation fixed-wing aircraft. A hallmark of Enstrom's helicopter designs from the outset has been the lack of exposed pitch change links for the main rotor, as the mechanisms are contained inside the hollow main rotor shaft, lowering aerodynamic drag. Enstrom ranked third in sales of piston helicopters, with 22 machines delivered in 2018 and 16 in 2019. ==Products== * Enstrom F-28 – piston engine * Enstrom TH180 – training (piston engine)TH180 - Enstrom training helicopter * Enstrom 280 – aerodynamically restyled F-28 * Enstrom 480 – turbine engine ==References== ==External links== * Enstrom Helicopter Corporation official page * Enstrom page on The Helicopter History site Category:Helicopter manufacturers of the United States Category:Companies based in Michigan Category:American companies established in 1959 Category:2012 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Enstrom Helicopter Corporation"},{"id":"9087647","text":"Erin Hoffman (born 1981) is an American game developer, blogger and fantasy writer.

Stoëbel was the pseudonym he used as a painter. ==Biography== Born on 21 December 1909 in Frenda, Algeria, died in December 2001 in Paris, France. From a very young age, he was attracted to music and graphic art, and these two art forms were closely linked throughout his life, giving his art a musical, rhythmic dimension. In Oran, he founded a small music school with 17 musicians, and conducted an orchestra, but he soon felt that he would not make any progress unless he went to Paris. In 1931, he arrived in Paris to work on his music and studied with Professor Léon Eugène Moreau, Grand prix de Rome, who taught him harmony, counterpoint, fugue and the piano until the declaration of war in 1939, when he left to rejoin his infantry corps. In 1940, faced with the rise in Nazism, he returned to Algeria where he painted, drew and conducted an orchestra until 1942. There are collections in Algeria which contain figurative works from this period. In 1942, the Americans landed in Oran, meaning that Jews no longer had to wear the yellow star there. This was the start of Edgar Stoëbel’s deep sympathy for the Americans and their wonderful organisational skills. He became aware that the Americans would have a long-lasting impact on the course of history in the 20th century. Due to the frequent contact he had with them, he ended up joining the Americans and the 7th Algerian Infantry Regiment of the French Expeditionary Corps in the Italy Campaign. In December 1942, he was very proud to be part of General Clark's 1st Army, which landed in Naples and fought the Italy campaign as far as Rome and Taranto. He landed in Provence on 19 August 1943, at Saint-Tropez and Port-Vendres and took part in military operations until 1945. He continued to draw scenes of daily life throughout the Italy campaign, and began producing imaginary drawings that prefigured the Figurasyntheses. After the Armistice, he returned to Paris and founded the Editions Stoëbel publishing house, writing music and songs which he produced in 78 rpm until the arrival of fine groove records. From 1945-46 onwards, he gradually left behind music to concentrate more on painting and drawing. Between 1946 and 1950 he painted a number of figurative landscapes of Montmartre, Place Clichy and Place Pigalle. From 1950 onwards, he frequented the artists’ area of Montparnasse and became friends with the enigmatic artist Anton Prinner, a friend of Veira da Silva, Pierre Loeb and Picasso. This lively band would invade the cafes of Montparnasse until very late at night, the evening often starting in La Coupole, a spot he frequented until the 1970s. He was also friends with the artists in Rue de la Grange-Batelière: Goetz, Mondzain, Michonze, Meyer-Lazar. In the 1970s, he met an Irish woman in Montparnasse who took him to Pub Olympia, where there was a fantastic atmosphere. He sang his own songs there: \\"Le beau Paulo\\", \\"La fille du marinero\\", \\"La Joconde à Paulo\\", which met with great success. The crowd loved him, and the wonderful contact he made with young people, by singing and drawing on the tables, took him back there every night until dawn. For several years he would return home in the early hours and then get up to draw and paint in the afternoon. Jacques Martin made a film on the life of Stoëbel, the painter and singer at the Pub Olympia. Music was a constant theme of his life, closely linked to his painting, the source of his art, the colourful rhythm of his canvases and part of his happiness. Happiness was a very important word in his work each of his canvases conveys the notion that every moment of life is a marvel. Edgar Stoëbel is a painter who symbolises happiness, the search for completeness and balance. In 1960, he invented his own style which he christened “Figurasynthese”. “Figurasynthese is the image one makes of an object, not the object in the form in which it appears to us: it is subjectivised and represents an unreal form in every way. The relationship between the forms is what makes the Figurasynthese.” This work is rooted in a deep philosophy. This idea of the balance of the world is always present in this artist's work. A Painter with a recognisable style. Emmanuel David, a major international art dealer, and one of the greatest collectors, who discovered Bernard Buffet, says: “When faced with the artist’s canvas, you are struck by the personality evident in the design and execution of the work. The sincerity of emotion, the height of the tone and colour, the sensitivity and simplicity of the “summarised” composition, create a balance of volume, a poetry, in which dreams and music give this work total originality and quality.” With Figurasynthese, he invented a recognisable style that makes his canvases easily identifiable. Stoëbel’s painting in the 1960s was part of the post-war concrete abstract movement, or concrete art, also known as Constructive Art. Pigeonholed by art critics for too long as something that happened in Paris and especially in New York, concrete abstract art was actually a worldwide movement that spread from South America to Northern Europe, and cannot simply be reduced to the French easel painting of Bazaine, Manessier, Hartung, Estève or Gischia. This movement, as referred to by Véronique Wiesinger in her introduction to the remarkable Catalogue “Abstract Art in France and Italy 1945-1975, focusing on Jean Leppien” at the Strasbourg Museum from November 1999 to February 2000, is “far from being the phoney echo of the pre-war Ecole de Paris, or a response to American abstract expressionism, abstraction was in fact, until the middle of the 1970s, the last firework of the modern movement, lighting all the fires that still burn today”. The following non-exhaustive list of painters, important figures in the history of art in this period, shows that the school of concrete abstraction was one of the most important contributors to 20th century Art: Josef Albers, Aagaard Andersen, Jean Arp, Jean-Michel Atlan, Willy Baumeister, André Bloc, André Bruyère, Busse, Marcelle Cahn, Antonio Carderara, Fernando Chevrier, Jean Couy, Heinrich Davring, Sonia Delaunay, Jean Deyrolle, Domela, Piero Dorazio, Adolphe Richard Fleishmann, Nato Frascà, Günter Fruhtrunk, Paolo Ghilardi, Gilioli, Hajdu, Johannes Itten, Joseph Jarema, Lapique, Jean Leppien, Anselmo Legnagni, Henri Lhotellier, Alberto Magnelli, Willy Maywald, François Morellet, Robert Mortensen, Bruno Munari, Aurélie Nemours, Henri Nouveau, Vera Pagava, Penalba, Edgar Pillet, Serge Poliakoff, Hans Reichel, Hans Richter, Michel Seuphor, Atanasio Soldati, Ferdinand Springer, Edgar Stoëbel, Gunta Stölzl, Nicolas Warb. At the end of the 1940s, Edgar Stoëbel created the first Figurasyntheses, at a time when many artists in the Ecole de Paris were working in abstraction, which saw its peak in the 1950s. Stoëbel did not sacrifice his art for the abstract fashion, but instead developed his own style which saw its peak in the 1960s. ==Museums== * Musée du Montparnasse, Paris, France * Beit Uri and Rami Nechustan Museum, Israel * Dimona Museum, Israel * Eilat Museum, Israel ==Bibliography== * Edgar Stoebel, Monograph by Lydia Harambourg, Editions du Cercle d'art, . * Benezit, Dictionary of Painters, Sculptors, Artists and Engravers ==Exhibitions and Salons== * Member of the Association of Jewish Painters, Sculptors and Engravers in France * Salon des Artistes Français * Salon d’Automne * Salon de l’Art Libre * 1955: Awarded the Deauville Grand Prix International * 1958: Personal exhibition, Galerie Briard, Marseille * 1960: Villa Robioni, Promenade des Anglais, Nice ** Studio sale at Public Auction in Orléans ** Studio sale at Public Auction in Angers * 1961: Public Auction organised by The Montpelier Galleries, at Bonham & Sons Ltd, London ** Public Auction at Philips and Neal & Sons, London ** XXXVI Salon Berruyer under the Presidency of Mr Lucien Lautrec at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts, Bourges * 1963: Galerie Bernard Chêne, Paris ** Galerie Montpensier at the Palais Royal, Paris ** Galerie Louisa Carrière, Paris ** Galerie Jory, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris * 1963: Galerie La Galère, Paris * 1964: Studio sale at Public Auction in Angers * 1964: Studio sale at Maître Robert, Drouot * 1969: Galerie Waldorf, Copenhagen, Denmark * 1972: Centre Culturel d’Art Juif, Paris [Paris Centre for Jewish Art] * 1973: Galerie Claude Jory, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris ** Winner of poster competition organised by WIZO * 1974: Beit Uri and Rami Nechushtan Museum, Ashdot Ya’Aqov, Israel ** Hakibutz Hameuhad, Israel ** P.N Emek Hajarden, Israel * Dimona Museum, Israel * Eilat Museum, Israel * 1982: City of Paris Silver Medal for a Figurasynthese * 2001/2003: Galerie Le Musée Privé, Paris * 2006: Montparnasse Museum, Paris * 2007: various exhibitions in museums and galleries. ==External links== * Edgar Stoebel Category:1909 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People from Frenda Category:Pieds-Noirs Category:French Jews Category:French male painters Category:Jewish painters Category:Modern painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Edgar Stoëbel"},{"id":"9087672","text":"William Henry Fellowes (15 July 1769 – 23 August 1837), of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire and Haverland Hall in Norfolk, was a British Member of Parliament. ==Life== He was the eldest son of William Fellowes and Lavinia Smyth.

He relocated to Germany in the 1930s and was an employee of Radio- Stuttgart where he worked on propaganda broadcast in French and aimed at promoting the Nazi regime and demoralizing French troops and civilians.Philippe Randa, Dictionnaire commenté de la Collaboration française, 1997 Ferdonnet was identified in 1939 by French intelligence as the main French speaker of Radio-Stuttgart.Nelly Archondoulis-Jaccard,Christian Delporte,Annie Duprat, L'Événement : Images, représentations, mémoire de la Révolution française à nos jours, Créaphis, 2004, p. 79 The previously obscure Ferdonnet became famous and notorious, and claimed that Britain would let France fight and die on its behalf: \\"Britain provides the machines, France provides the bodies\\". After the fall of France, transmissions in French were progressively discontinued and Ferdonnet stopped working for Radio-Stuttgart around 1942. He was arrested after the fall of Nazi Germany and executed for treason in 1945. During his trial, Ferdonnet asserted in vain that he had not been the speaker. Some historians consider that he might have merely worked for Radio-Stuttgart as a translator of the scripts submitted by the Germans, his translations being read by another Frenchman. According to writer Maurice- Yvan Sicard (writing under the pseudonym Saint-Paulien and himself a former collaborationist), the actual speaker was \\"a former actor named Obrecht\\", an actor who was never found.

Founded and owned by the Brigidine Sisters in 1956, Clonard College draws its rich heritage from the traditions of the Brigidine order and Kildare Ministries. The College Principal, since 2019, is Luci Quinn. ==Overview== Clonard School came into official existence in 1956. At the invitation of Father John Tresidder (Manifold Parish Priest), the Brigidine Sisters acquired the Clonard property and retained the name \\"Clonard\\" because of the association between Saint Brigid and Saint Finnian of Clonard in fifth century Ireland. There was a crisis in Catholic education at the time as Sacred Heart, Geelong's only all-girls Catholic college, was severely overcrowded. Early in 1956, a group of founder sisters, including the much lauded Sister Lelia Grant, began taking classes at Clonard. In its initial year, Clonard College boasted 40 students. Clonard College was officially opened on 9 February 1958. Key moments in the College's development included the simultaneous construction of an assembly hall and library, in 1977, partly funded by the first Federal grant. In 1983, John Shannon became the first full-time lay Principal. In the late 1990s Clonard's leadership followed the example of some other Brigidine schools in adopting Co Principalship model when Vicki Myers (a former Clonard student) joined Michael Doyle in the Co-Principal positions. The late 1990s and early part of the 21st century saw revitalised enrolment growth, accommodated by expansive building programs, delivering a theatre, design education centre, materials technology room, expanded office space, refurbished science facilities, a gymnasium and multi purpose court within the school grounds. In 2006 Clonard celebrated its 50th anniversary with a range of functions involving past students and key founders. The year of celebration reached its peak with the Anniversary Dinner at Kardinia Park and concluded with the 2006 Celebration of Achievement Evening at Costa Hall, whose theme reflected 50 years of achievement in the name of Clonard. In physical terms, the College's expansion and development continued with the opening of the newly built two-storey Year 12 Center, containing a number of modern and flexible learning areas and office spaces on its upper floor and the large \\"Independent Learning Centre\\", beneath, dedicated to serving the particular personal and academic needs of the College's Year 12 girls. Early in 2008, the year 7 rooms along Church Street were demolished to allow construction of a modern, two-storey Year 7 Centre, equipped with a range of sustainability technologies. The Year 7 Learning Centre was officially opened on 24 April 2009. In November 2012, it was announced that Clonard College had purchased \\"Minerva\\", a former campus of Western Heights College. In 2013, Clonard embarked on a major building project with the construction of a new Yr. 8 & 9 Centre, along with the demolition and refurbishment of the Minerva road campus. In September 2018, a multipurpose building along the Church Street entrance was completed and opened to students, mainly consisting of a library and counselling services. ==House system and uniform== Clonard has a house system consisting of four houses: *Kildare (green) - Named after County Kildare in Ireland, where St. Brigid lived. *Lelia (red) - Named after Sister Lelia Grant, one of the school's founding nuns. *Finian (white) - Named after St. Finian of Clonard. *Xavier (yellow) - Named after St. Francis Xavier. The school has three uniforms; summer, winter and PE. The school's summer uniform consists of a green check dress, a green jumper for Years 7-9, a red jumper for Years 10-12, a red blazer, grey socks and black school shoes. The school's winter uniform consists of a white blouse, a tartan kilt, the same jumper and blazer, grey socks and black school shoes. The school's PE uniform consists of a red and green polo shirt, a tracksuit jacket, rugby jumper, (either can be worn), shorts or tracksuit pants, school sport socks and sport shoes. == See also == * List of non-government schools in Victoria * List of schools in Geelong * Victorian Certificate of Education * Vocational Education and Training * Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning ==References== ==External links== * Clonard College website Category:Educational institutions established in 1956 Category:Schools in Geelong Category:1956 establishments in Australia Category:Girls' schools in Victoria (Australia) Category:Catholic secondary schools in Victoria (Australia) Category:Brigidine schools ","title":"Clonard College"},{"id":"9087830","text":"Paperwhite may refer to: * Paperwhite (band), an American synthpop group * Kindle Paperwhite, an e-book reader * Narcissus papyraceus or Paperwhite, a perennial bulbous plant * Narcissus tazetta or Paperwhite, a perennial ornamental plant ","title":"Paperwhite"},{"id":"9087833","text":"Maria Fumaça of EFOM in São João del-Rei station The Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas (EFOM) was a narrow-gauge railway located in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. At its peak the railway's route totalled . A portion of the railway still operates as a heritage railway, and one of the major stations (São João del Rei) is now Brazil's largest railway museum. ==History== railways entered Minas Gerais in the 1870s, pushing towards the city of Belo Horizonte. Almost immediately attention turned to the construction of narrow-gauge feeder lines. In 1872 Provincial President Dr. Joaquim Floriano de Godoy signed into law approval for a narrow-gauge railway from the broad-gauge line heading west towards a navigable point on the Rio Grande. A subsequent law in 1877 limited the railway to initially building only as far as São João del Rei. A company, the Companhia Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas, was established in 1878, and a decision was made to make the junction with the broad gauge at Sítio (Antônio Carlos). The gauge of was chosen in 1879. The exact reason for the choice of gauge is not known; one theory is that an American engineer was familiar with the Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia in Chile. In any case, construction was begun in June 1879, with the first section opening between Sitio and Barrosso in September 1880. The line was opened through to São João del Rei on 28 August 1881 by the Emperor Dom Pedro II. The company sought permission to extend the railway and over the subsequent 15 years built a number of extensions until it reached Paraopeba. Apart from a small number of short branches, the railway was more or less complete by 1894. During this time the line had been reasonably profitable, returning small dividends. However, in 1894 the railway barely broke even, and following years brought losses. By April 1900 the company was in liquidation, and a month and a half strike by employees was only halted when the State government paid their back pay. The entire railway was placed up for auction on 13 June 1903 and purchased by the Federal Treasury. Several branches were constructed in the period up to 1923, but no extensions after that date. Operation of the line was divested to the State government in 1931. In the meantime, had been adopted as the primary gauge for secondary lines in Brazil. Lines radiating to the west from Belo Horizonte crossed the railway at Divinópolis and Velho Dataipa. By 1953, control of the railway reverted to the Federal government. During the period 1960 to 1965 most of the railway was either closed or converted to metre gauge. Only the section from Antônio Carlos to Aureliano Mourão was retained. The Antônio Carlos line survived mainly on limestone traffic associated with a cement plant. Passenger traffic declined to a single coach attached to a daily mixed train. However, as the 1970s progressed, the line became more popular with tourists, and passenger traffic grew dramatically. In 1983 the closure of the cement plant brought the closure of the majority of the line, with only the section from Tiradentes to São João Del Rei being retained as a tourist line. ==Route== The main line route was shaped like an \\"L\\". The line headed west from the junction at Antonio Carlos, through São João Del Rei, to Aureliano Mourão. From Aureliano Mourao the line headed north though Divinopolis and Pompeu to the terminal at Paraopeba.

They had a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and weighed about 13 tons, plus tender. Further 4-4-0s followed, and as the railway grew also 4-6-0s and 2-8-0s. Some of the larger locomotives were up to about 25 tons in weight. Initially the locomotives used wood as a fuel, however later they were converted to oil. In all 58 locomotives were built for the railway. Baldwin built all but five, with three being built by American Locomotive Company (ALCo), and two in the railway's own workshops. These included the last locomotive acquired by the railway, a 2-8-0 constructed in 1920. Records indicate this locomotive was built for about half the cost of an imported locomotive, but performed equally well. Sixteen locomotives survived to the final closure of the railway, and were subsequently preserved, including locomotive number 1. ==Rio Grande navigation== The EFOM met the Rio Grande at Riberao Vermelho, from where the railway ran a steam navigation service down the river for 208 km, as far as Capetina. There were six stations on the river between Riberao Vermelho and Capetinga, and a passenger and freight service was operated between 1889 and 1963. The railway operated a fleet of 6 stern- wheel paddle steamers, together with barges and launches. ==Preservation and museum== At the time of the final closure in 1983 the railway was attracting increasing numbers of tourists. A decision was made to turn the substantial station, workshops and roundhouse in São João del Rei into a railway museum. Fourteen locomotives, as well as the remaining rolling stock was brought to São João del Rei, together with a number of items of metre gauge equipment. The roundhouse had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1972. The new museum became the largest railway museum in Brazil, and was opened in August 1984. At the same time a 13 km stretch of track to Tiradentes was retained for the tourist railway operation. Regular passenger trains are operated over this stretch of track, using the original equipment of the railway. Trains are run on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. Occasional lineside fires caused by sparks igniting brushwood have been acclaimed as adding to the experience. ==References== *Waters, P. West of Minas Narrow Gauge 2001.

Intellectual property (IP) is a very complex area and covers a vast range of diverse subjects.UK Patent Office advice As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP. ==Registration services== Registration services are organizations or individuals that contact IP applicants or owners and request payment for an apparently official registration of their IP. Many applicants for and owners of patents, trademarks and industrial design rights receive letters from such registration services and different IP offices and organizations around the world regularly issue warnings in connection with the offered services. The registration services target applicants directly because patent, trademark and design applications are published a set time after filing or upon grant along with freely available information about a name and address for the applicant. Registration services use this information to send requests for payment to applicants shortly after publication. The documents are confusing as they appear to be from official governmental agencies and to be legitimate invoices. A scam increasing in frequency, as of October 2011, is an email originating from a domain name registrar or IT consulting company based in China that purports to notify a trademark holder that another entity is seeking to register the client’s trademark or business name as a domain name in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Asia. The email gives the brand owner a short period in time in which to secure the domain name for their own. These notifications are essentially solicitations. Generally, in the event there really is a third-party who is seeking to register your brand name for nefarious purposes, there are channels available for addressing such uses if and when they materialize. ===Published warnings for different forms of IP=== * American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) - Patent Registry Scams * Australian Patent Office - Warning!

It was founded in 1922 and ever since then has been competing domestically in Kosovo. Throughout the years after World War II, Vučitrn became one of the most renowned football clubs in Kosovo due to producing some of Kosovos’ best young talents. Many of these players were transferred to other Kosovar clubs such as Prishtina and Trepça due to them playing in former Yugoslav First League. After the Kosovo War, the citizens & supporters returned to its stadium stands. Although numerously fighting relegation throughout the seasons during the 2000s one thing was for sure, the “Ferki Aliu Stadium” would always be packed to the rafters during every home game. The clubs’ ultras group “Forca” gained a nation wide generalisation during that period due to many opposing teams supporters being the subject of verbal and physical abuse when they would travel and watch their team play in the city of Vushtrri. Due to this the club was constantly fined and deducted points and became one of Kosovos most hated teams and fiercest cities to play away at. In 2012 the club was purchased by local steel galvanising plant, Llamkos GalvaSteel.Kosova Football Club is officially owned by Llamkos GalvaSteel When the club was taken over by Llamkos GalvaSteel and the Core Group, there were immediate investments made which resulted in the club winning their 2013–14 league title, which was the first in its history. Llamkos GalvaSteel then distanced itself from the club as did the club's owner Jeton Sadiku, leaving the financing and management in the hands of the Vučitrn municipality.Kthehet Kosova e Vushtrrisë!

They came to prominence in 1831 for murdering victims to sell to anatomists, by luring and drugging them at their dwelling in the northern end of Bethnal Green, near St Leonard's, Shoreditch in London. ==BackgroundNova Scotia Gardens=== Nova Scotia Gardens was the area of a brick field, north-east of St Leonard's, Shoreditch. The brick clay had been exhausted and the area begun to be filled in with waste (\\"leystall\\", literally excrement). Cottages (probably evolving from sheds serving the gardens) came to be built here, but were undesirable as they remained below ground level, and so were prone to flooding.\\"Bethnal Green: The North West: Hackney Road\\", A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 112-14 date accessed: 21 January 2007. ===Anatomy=== During the early 19th century, the demand for legally obtained cadavers for the study and teaching of anatomy in British medical schools greatly exceeded the supply.\\"Legitimate\\" cadavers were typically those of executed criminals, or (more rarely) those donated by relatives. In the 18th century, hundreds had been executed each year, often for quite trivial crimes, but by the 19th century only 55 people were being hanged each year, while as many as 500 were needed.East London History accessed 24 January 2007 As medical science began to flourish, demand rose sharply and attracted criminal elements willing to obtain specimens by any means. The activities of body-snatchers, or resurrectionists, gave rise to a particular public fear and revulsion. Relatives, or people paid by them, often guarded new graves for a period after burial. ==MurdersGang of Burkers=== Engraving of the London Burkers, from left: John Bishop, Thomas Williams, James May. John Bishop, together with Thomas Williams, Michael Shields, a Covent Garden porter, and James May, an unemployed butcher, also known as Jack Stirabout and Black Eyed Jack, formed a notorious gang of resurrection men, stealing freshly buried bodies for sale to anatomists. In his subsequent confession, Bishop admitted to stealing (and selling) between 500 and 1,000 bodies,Newgate Calendar Vol.5 (1831) accessed 21 January 2007 over a period of twelve years. The corpses were sold to anatomists, including surgeons from St Bartholomew's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital and King's College. The Fortune of War Public House, in Smithfield, was identified as a popular resort for resurrectionists.Old Bailey on-line - Trial transcript accessed 15 April 2009 ===\\"Italian Boy\\" Murder=== In July 1830, John Bishop rented No. 3 Nova Scotia Garden, from Sarah Trueby. On 5 November 1831 the suspiciously fresh corpse of a 14-year-old boy was delivered, by Bishop and May, to the King's College School of Anatomy, in the Strand. They had previously tried to sell the body at Guy's Hospital, but it was refused.Kings College London FAQ 52 accessed 24 January 2007 They demanded twelve guineas for the body, but were offered nine. On inspection by Richard Partridge, demonstrator of anatomy, it was suspected that the body had not been buried, and police were summoned by Herbert Mayo, the professor of anatomy, from the station at Covent Garden. The resurrection men were arrested, and remanded in custody, by the magistrate. On 8 November, a coroners' jury was held, and found a verdict of \\"wilful murder against some person or persons unknown\\", but expressed their strong belief that the prisoners, Bishop, Williams and May, had been concerned in the transaction. On 19 November 1831, Joseph Sadler Thomas, a Metropolitan Police superintendent of F (Covent Garden) Division,Early Murder Investigations accessed 24 January 2007 searched the cottages at Nova Scotia Gardens, and found items of clothing in a well in one of the gardens, and also in one of the privies, suggesting multiple murders. The prisoners appeared at trial, before Chief Justice Tindal, Justice Joseph Littledale and Baron Vaughan, at the Old Bailey between 2 and 3 December. Bishop (aged 33), Williams (aged 26) and May (aged 30) were all found guilty of the crime. The windows were opened to allow the public to hear the Recorder pronounce sentence of death. By an extraordinary arrangement, the police opened the premises at Nova Scotia Gardens for viewing, charging 5 shillings. The public carried away the dwellings, piece by piece, as souvenirs. The police had tentatively identified the body as that of Carlo Ferrari, an Italian boy, from Piedmont, but after their trial Bishop and Williams said that the body belonged to a Lincolnshire cattle drover, on his way to Smithfield. ===Confession=== Bishop and Williams attended the prison chapel on Sunday, 4 December. Afterwards, they were placed in the same cell and the ordinary and under-sheriffs of London took their written confessions. John Bishop admitted that the Lincolnshire boy was taken on 3 November, from The Bell in Smithfield, with the excuse of lodging at Nova Scotia Gardens. On arrival, he was drugged with rum and laudanum. Bishop and Williams then went to drink at the Feathers, near Shoreditch church. They returned when the boy had lost consciousness and then pitched him head first into the well, attaching a cord to the feet. After a brief struggle the boy was dead; again they went out, and on their return removed and undressed the boy, placing him in a bag. They also admitted to the murder, on 9 October, of an indigent, Frances Pigburn, sleeping rough in Shoreditch. They lured her into the adjacent empty cottage, No. 2. The method was the same, but this time they had bided their time in the London Apprentice in Old Street. The bodies were taken to St Thomas's, for a surgeon Mr South. Due to a delay in acceptance, they were then taken to a Mr Grainger and sold for eight guineas. A further victim, a boy named Cunningham, was found sleeping in the pig-market at Smithfield on Friday, 21 October; again lodging was promised. He was drugged with a mixture of warm beer, sugar, rum and laudanum, and murdered in the well. He was undressed, bagged, then sold for eight guineas to a Mr Smith at St Bartholomew's Hospital. The confessions exonerated the other members of the gang, who would often help with delivery, of involvement in the murders. ===Sentencing=== Bishop and Williams were hanged at Newgate on 5 December 1831 for the murder, before a crowd of thirty thousand. May was respited during his Majesty's pleasure, as it was accepted that he had no knowledge of the murders. The bodies were removed the same night, Bishop to King's College and Williams to the Theatre of Anatomy in Windmill Street, The Haymarket, for dissection. On the Tuesday and Wednesday, large crowds viewed their remains. James May was sentenced to life transportation to Van Diemen's Land on 1 December 1831. He received a two-year sentence to Port Arthur for insubordination on board the transport vessel and died at the settlement in 1834, buried in an unmarked grave on the Isle of the Dead. In the same year, Catherine Walsh of Whitechapel, who made her living by selling laces and cotton, was murdered by Elizabeth Ross, who sold the body to surgeons. She was hanged for the murder.East London History accessed 25 January 2007 These murders and the West Port murders led to the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 that finally provided for an adequate and legitimate supply of corpses for the medical schools. By 1840, the area of Nova Scotia Gardens had degenerated into a notorious slum. It is for this reason that the philanthropist, Angela Burdett-Coutts purchased the land, and, after the leases expired, established Columbia Market in 1869. ==References and notes== *An alternate source for the Newgate Calendar Volume V (Tarlton Law Library) accessed 24 Jan 2007 * Harding, William, stenographer.

The commission was formed by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated November 2, 1942. The decree stipulated that the task of the ChGK was to “take full account of the villainous crimes of the Nazis and the damage they caused to Soviet citizens and the socialist state, to establish the identity of the German fascist criminals with the aim of bringing them to trial and severe punishment; unification and coordination of the work already carried out by the Soviet state bodies in this area. \\" ==History== The Commission's full ceremonial name was: \\"Extraordinary State Commission for Ascertaining and Investigating Crimes Perpetrated by the German-Fascist Invaders and their Accomplices\\" (, ChGK). The official aim of this agency included \\"punishing for the crimes of the German–fascist aggressors.\\" According to its own data, 32,000 regular organization staff took part in the work of ChGK. On top of that, around 7,000,000 Soviet citizens had participated in the collection of materials and evidence. The first 27 reports published by ChGK constituted the majority of Soviet evidentiary material in the Nuremberg process and the trials of Japanese war criminals. The reports appeared in English in the daily publication Soviet War News issued by the Press Department of the Soviet Embassy in London. The first report, Protocol on the plunder by the German–Fascist invaders of Rostov Museum at Pyatigorsk, was published on June 28, 1943Soviet War News, June 28, 1943. No. 597 and the last report, Statement on \\"Material Damage caused by the German-Fascist invaders to state enterprises and institutions, collective farms, public bodies and citizens of the U.S.S.R\\" was published on September 18, 1945.Soviet War News, September 18, 1945. No. 1257.

(Publishers), Ltd, 1946, pp 77-317 === Work of the Commission === The facts of atrocities were to be established by acts on the basis of statements by Soviet citizens, interviews of victims, witnesses, medical examinations and inspection of the crime scene. At the same time, it was necessary to establish the perpetrators of the atrocities - the organizers, instigators, perpetrators, accomplices, their names, the names of military units, institutions, organizations. The acts were to contain as accurate a description of the crimes committed as possible. It was necessary to indicate the surname, name, patronymic and place of residence of citizens certifying the fact of atrocity. All relevant documents were to be attached to the acts - protocols of interviews, statements of citizens, opinions of medical experts, photographs, letters from Soviet people deported to Germany, German documents, etc. Members of the commission and secretariat staff traveled to different republics to help organize the work of local commissions and to monitor their work. They inspected graves and corpses, collected numerous testimonies from witnesses and released prisoners of German prisons and concentration camps, interrogated captured soldiers and officers, studied enemy documents, photographs and other evidence of heinous crimes. In addition, according to most historians, some of the crimes for which the Extraordinary State Commission blamed the German side were in fact committed by Soviet state security agencies. In particular, this concerns the execution of prisoners of war near Katyn (in this case, the members of the Commission simply signed a report prepared in advance by the NKVD ) and the execution of prisoners in Vinnitsa (the investigation report of which, however, was never published. http://web.archive.org/web/20150616025918/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/news/jurnal_nodostup/Poulsen.pdf ==Members of the Commission== The decree issued by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R on 2 November 1942 confirmed the appointment of the following members of the commission: *Nikolay Mikhailovich Shvernik (1888–1970) Chairman *Academician Nikolay Nilovitsch Burdenko (1876–1946) *Academician Boris Yevgenyevich Vedenyev (1884–1946) *Valentina Stepanovna Grizodubova (1910–1993) *Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov (1896–1948) *Nicholas (Yarushevich) - Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia (1892–1961) *Academician Trofim Denisovitch Lysenko (1898–1976) *Academician Yevgeni Viktorovich Tarle (1875–1955) *Alexei Nikolayevich Tolstoi (1882–1945) *Academician Ilya Pavlovich Trainin (1886–1949) ==List of Reports submitted at Nuremberg== The Soviet prosecution introduced 31 reports from the Extraordinary State Commission as Exhibits for the prosecution at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, 1949, Volume XXIV \\"Exhibits of the Soviet Prosecution\\", pp. 170-186 #USSR-1 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in the Stavropol region #USSR-2 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the destruction of industry, etc. in the Stalino region #USSR-2(a) Report of a special commission on crimes in Stalino #USSR-4 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on causing death by spreading epidemic of typhus #USSR-5 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on the \\"Gross-lazarett\\" in the town of Slavuta #USSR-6 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in the Lvov region #USSR-8 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in Auschwitz Nazi death camps #USSR-7 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Lithuania #USSR-9 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Kiev #USSR-29 Joint Polish and Soviet report of the Extraordinary State Commission #USSR-35 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on losses sustained by State enterprises and establishments #USSR-37 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on crimes in the city of Kupiansk #USSR-38 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on German crimes in the city of Minsk #USSR-39 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission on atrocities in Estonia #USSR-40 Report of the Extraordinary State Commission concerning destruction and atrocities in the Pushkin Reservation of the U.S.S.R.

Seiter and starring Nancy Carroll, Cary Grant, and Randolph Scott. This was Grant's first role as a leading man. Based on the novel Hot Saturday by Harvey Fergusson, the film is about a pretty, virtuous small-town bank clerk who becomes the victim of a vicious rumor. ==Plot== A pretty young bank clerk, Ruth Brock (Nancy Carroll), attracts the young men in the small town of Marysville. Rich playboy Romer Sheffield (Cary Grant) is no exception, even though he has Camille (Rita La Roy) staying openly at his mansion, scandalizing the locals. Jealous, Camille soon leaves. Ruth, however, is all business whenever Romer tries to become better acquainted with her at the bank. She agrees to go on a date on Saturday with fellow employee Conny Billup (Edward Woods). Romer invites Conny and his crowd to party at his estate, offering free food and drink, just so he can spend some time with Ruth. They stay long enough for Romer to take Ruth on a long walk and have a heartfelt conversation. The gang then heads to a lakeshore dance hall. Conny gets Ruth alone on a nighttime boat ride, but she jumps ashore to avoid his unwanted pawing of her. Out of spite, he leaves her behind. She has to walk to Romer's estate. Conny eventually finds her there, but she does not want to see him, and Romer makes him drive away without her. Romer sends Ruth home in his chauffeured car; she is seen arriving home early in the morning by Eva Randolph (Lilian Bond), the daughter of an important bank executive. Inside, Ruth is pleasantly surprised to find childhood friend and geologist Bill Fadden (Randolph Scott) in the kitchen. He has returned to do some surveying after seven years away. Bill makes it clear he is in love with her. When Eva questions Conny about what happened the night before, he lies. The lies quickly spread, and soon the local gossips have distorted the story so much that everybody thinks that Ruth and Romer are having a brazen affair. As a result, Eva's father fires Ruth. After quarreling with her mother (Jane Darwell), Ruth flees to Bill's campsite. Caught in a rainstorm, she faints just outside Bill's shelter. Bill finds her and brings her inside. When he is unable to awaken her, he removes her wet clothes to keep her warm. When she does regain consciousness, they become engaged, though she does not tell him about the ugly rumors. However, Conny maliciously has Eva invite Romer to the dance hall where Ruth and Bill are. Once Romer grasps the situation, he graciously tries to bow out, but Bill hears the vicious gossip and breaks off the engagement. By the next morning, Bill has reconsidered, but she informs him that while the stories were not true the night before, they are now in the morning. She spent the night with Romer. Romer picks her up and tells her they will get married in New York. ==Cast== * Nancy Carroll as Ruth Brock * Cary Grant as Romer Sheffield * Randolph Scott as Bill Fadden * Edward Woods as Conny Billop * Lilian Bond as Eva Randolph * William Collier, Sr. as Harry Brock, Ruth's father * Jane Darwell as Mrs Ida Brock * Stanley Smith as Joe * Rita La Roy as Camille * Rose Coghlan as Annie Brock, Ruth's younger sister * Oscar Apfel as Ed W.

WTJU is owned and operated by University of Virginia. ==History== A WTJU DJ hosts a show during the 2013 Rock Marathon WTJU hosts a live remote broadcast from the \\"Rally on the Lawn,\\" where thousands of students, faculty, alumni, and community members had gathered to support recently ousted University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan. WTJU was founded in 1955 when U.Va.’s Department of Speech and Drama decided to start an educational radio station to serve the larger community. WUVA, the university's carrier current AM station, had been broadcasting popular music to students since 1947. The fraternity Kappa Delta Pi put up a large part of the funds necessary to get the station off the ground. On May 10, 1957, WTJU went on the air at 91.3 FM with a classical music format. It was able to broadcast throughout Charlottesville, building a small but dedicated group of listeners. In 1959, the station aired its first ever music marathon: the Classical Marathon, held during U.Va.’s exam period. In 1963, WTJU became a full-fledged student organization, separate from the U.Va. Department of Speech and Drama. By 1971, WTJU began broadcasting rock music, as well as some jazz and folk programs. By 1974, WTJU was broadcasting 24 hours a day. It also allowed non-students to be DJs in order to keep the station broadcasting 24/7 year-round. In 1993, WTJU's license was threatened when student administrators accidentally violated FCC rules in filing a routine document. The Dean of Students office insisted the station hire its first paid staff member, General Manager Chuck Taylor, requiring a transition from an independent student organization – the model followed by WUVA – to direct oversight from the university. In the same year, WTJU changed its frequency from 91.3 to 91.1 FM. In the late 1990s, planned construction at U.Va.'s Peabody Hall forced WTJU to relocate into studios in Lambeth Commons. By 2010, WTJU had also started streaming its radio programming over the internet. Taylor retired in 2010. At the time, the station had low listenership and was in deep financial trouble. Administrators pressed ahead with a search for new management, even as the university Board of Visitors approved turning in the station's license if they did not see a path to viability. Burr Beard was hired as Taylor's replacement in April 2010. Beard proposed sweeping changes to the station’s operation: abandoning the longstanding freeform scheduling policy in favor of a focus on \\"Americana\\" music; moving specialty jazz and rock programs to evening and late night, respectively; eliminating classical music altogether; and instituting a small rotation of four songs per hour. Beard's proposals led to backlash from both volunteers and listeners, who feared the potential loss of the station's identity and cancellations of specialty shows. Beard resigned in October 2010 without implementing any changes and the station began its search for a new manager. In 2011, Nathan Moore was hired and is the current general manager. The station has seen a resurgence of interest and increased fundraising in the following years. In 2011, WTJU participated in the first-ever College Radio Day. In 2012, WTJU aired a live remote broadcast of the \\"Rally on the Lawn\\" demonstration against the ouster of U.Va. President Teresa A. Sullivan. Also in 2012, WTJU aired a special modern adaptation of The War of the Worlds on Halloween night. On February 1, 2015, WTJU entered into a three-year local marketing agreement with WHAN (1430 AM) in Ashland, Virginia. WTJU's programming was rebroadcast on WHAN and its FM translator (W275BQ, 102.9 FM) to cover the city of Richmond with a broadcast signal. WTJU exited the agreement early on August 16, 2017, as the signal was found to be inadequate and the increase in underwriting from the Richmond market did not offset the cost. In addition to its on-air activities, WTJU also produces a variety of music and educational events such as live concerts, film screenings, and youth radio camps. Since 2015, WTJU has hosted a series of free outdoor concerts at Charlottesville's IX Art Park each fall, emphasizing eclectic music and creative community building. In March 2019, WTJU and WXTJ-LP moved into new studios, which include a stage for live performances and community events. On March 23, the station opened the new studios by breaking the Guinness World Record for \\"most radio DJs presenting one radio show simultaneously,\\" although it only briefly held the title as it was broken again 18 days later. Among the well-known artists who have been DJs at WTJU are Pavement's Stephen Malkmus, Dave Matthews Band's Boyd Tinsley, Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield, Yo La Tengo's James McNew, Jagjaguwar founder Darius Van Arman, and blues musician Corey Harris. ==WXTJ== Hiring professional staff in the 1990s necessitated removing WTJU from limits on non-university-affiliated members that bind student organizations and club sports. Initially brought on to keep the station running over breaks, community members began making up an increasing proportion of announcers in the 1990s and 2000s. In response to declining student involvement, WTJU founded WXTJ-LP (100.1 FM), a sister station run and staffed entirely by students, in October 2013. WXTJ operates within WTJU's building and primarily consists of rock, hip hop, and electronic music. Several student DJs host programs on both stations. ==Programming== WTJU allows its volunteer DJs to play nearly anything they choose, as long as it does not violate Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules for decency. All of WTJU's DJs are volunteers from the community, including U.Va. students, faculty and staff, alumni, and community members. Most of the shows feature music and are broadly categorized into classical, folk, jazz and blues, and rock. The music across all genres tends to be highly eclectic, with a heavy emphasis on music that is rarely, if ever, heard on commercial radio stations. The station is not a member of NPR, although its schedule includes some spoken-word programming in overnights and short public-affairs modules during and between shows. ==See also== *List of community radio stations in the United States ==References== ==External links== * 91.1 WTJU Online * * \\"Radioheads: locals succumb to the call of the airwaves\\" 2007 article in The Hook * \\"After time of turmoil, WTJU reprograms, increases fundraising\\" 2012 article in The Daily Progress * \\"WTJU keeps it eclectic\\" 2013 article in The Daily Progress * \\"Charlottesville Radio Station Celebrates a Century of Jazz\\" 2017 article in U.S. News & World Report * \\"Radio Station Visit #129 – WTJU at University of Virginia\\" 2017 article in Radio Survivor Category:1957 establishments in Virginia Category:Variety radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1957 TJU TJU Category:Community radio stations in the United States Category:University of Virginia Category:Mass media in Charlottesville, Virginia ","title":"WTJU"},{"id":"9088061","text":"The New Zealand Under 21s rugby union team was a national representative team for players aged under-21.

Chatin was born in a well-known family of trading traditions, in Shkodër, Albania. He was brought up with an occidental mentality in an environment of European cultural roots. This influence, seems to have helped him in covering for a short period of time, a diplomatic position in the High Administration of King Zog the First. His widow (Désirée) Elizabeth, whom he married on 5 December 1961, died on 2 November 2003. Chatin Sarachi's marriage certificate states that he had been previously married but that that earlier marriage had been “annulled”. It also appears from the marriage certificate that he was born in 1899. His father Gjok Saraçi is said to have been a landowner.Certified Copy of an Entry of Marriage, General Register Office, London, 1961 (D), vol. 05C, p. 219 (3) On the other hand, family sources refer to Chatin's father as a translator. Sarachi's death certificate confirms 14 June 1899 as the date of his birth. He died on 27 November 1974.Certified Copy of an Entry of Death, General Register Office, London, 1974 (D), vol. 15, p. 2184 He was a close friend of John St Aubyn, 4th Baron St Levan. == Sarachi as a painter == Sarachi's and Kokoschka's studio in Stratford Road Chatin Sarachi first went to England on a diplomatic mission in 1933. In fact, the occupation of Albania from the Italian army coincides with Chatin's position as First Secretary of the Albanian Embassy in London, where he became a well-known painter. Within a few years he had decided to remain in London and gave up his diplomatic career to concentrate on painting. In 1939 Sarachi met the great expressionist artist Oskar Kokoschka. Kokoschka became a close friend and admirer of Sarachi as well as a constant influence on his work. They shared a Kensington studio in Stratford Road, not far from the Pride Gallery, and worked together leaving as a witness of their friendship, many drawings and paintings of each other. In the press of that period, his name is mentioned among the best representatives of English Impressionism, including Oscar Kokoschka. The landscapes, the still lifes, and the flower paintings of Sarachi, exude a vibrant quality with a strictly personal use of colour and tone, achieved through his mastery of watercolors and pastels. In addition, his delicate line drawings indicate that Sarachi was also greatly influenced by Oriental art. Sarachi's first personal exhibition was held in the aftermath of the Second World War (1945) at the Redfern Gallery, in London. In the folder advertising this exhibition there was written the phrase: \\"The miracles can still happen in the slaughterhouse of agony, crime and corruption that best describes our world. This is the message that the paintings of Chatin Sarachi express.\\"which we think to be very suitable to his work and personality\\".Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Redfern Gallery in 1945 Kokoschka, Oskar. \\"Chatin Sarachi\\" - London, 1959 On the Catalogue of the exhibition, among other things, Kokoschka states: :\\"A contemporary painter with whom the larger public has not yet become acquainted does well to make his own decision of what he thinks the message, contained in his work, will be to those who are to greet him as the morning star. :\\"In the oils and drawings exhibited by Chatin Sarachi here is the work of a former diplomat whom one mighty moment has blessed. Who, at a sudden, was reminded of the time when, as a child, he trod the rude shore and the bare ground of his native Albania.\\" Kokoschka, Oscar. Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Redfern Gallery in 1945 This first exhibition was followed by other two, in the mid fifties. A fourth, commemorating one, with fifty of his best paintings was opened in 1975. It included drawings, oil and water paintings, of landscapes, still lives, and several portraits. In the opening of this exhibition J.P. Hodin concludes with saying that Chatin Sarachi \\" …was a very good friend, an elaborate artist and one of the most colourful personalities ever known. He liked the high life but, at the same time, was so introspective. He had great artistic ambitions but little interest in criticism\\". Over the years, Sarachi participated in several group shows and had regular one man exhibitions in London, Paris and Dublin.Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Pride Gallery in 1988 The last exhibition of his work was held at the Pride Gallery in London in 1988. Today, the work of Chatin is considered to be closely connected to Expressionism although his knowledge and appreciation included influences of Japanese and Chinese painters. This influence can be noticed quite clearly in some of his masterpieces, as are the flower paintings. == Sarachi as a politician == Already, at a very early age, Sarachi was known to be a very close friend of the King. In communicating to Him (Zog), Chatin calls himself as:\\" [Your] ex best friend\\". It is this friendship that characterized the antagonistic, political arena of that time, to transform this Zog-Sarachi co-operation into an indissoluble and symbiotic relation and even to imply an unproved and shameful involvement of the name of Chatin Sarachi in Luigj Gurakuqi's murderer.Panorama, November 14, 2006 Sarachi, among his many writings, left a statement about the King Ahmet Zog the First, published in Albania in the year 2006. The typewriting entitled: ”The story of a bad man”, was left in the safe of a bank in London, from where it has been taken and translated into Albanian.Plasari, Aurel. Who was Chatin Sarachi - Shekulli - February 7, 2002 - N° 179 (1479) In his writings, Sarachi, among other things, speaking to King Zog, states: > \\"Your callings about our old friendship show that your conscience and its > nibbles are at work. Independently from your legal business, you began your > reign by killing patriots and by selling your own country. Alessandro > Lessona (Minister of Mussolini's government), a friend of mine at the time, > paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. Even I had > the right to act, I never asked for my part. That money, as anyone in > Albania knows, has been washed by the blood of patriots like Bajram Curri, > Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi and thousands of them. The money you are > living with today, is the product of the lowest betrayal and is washed by > the tears and the suffering of a whole nation, the nation you sold, you > Albanian Judas! I know each dark corner of your soul, not a single event of > your reign that I ignore. From your cottage in the mountains, where you were > born, you came to live in luxurious castles around Europe.

It is a licensed Nintendo product that combines the Family Computer (Famicom) and the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) into a single piece of hardware. Sharp removed most Nintendo branding from the system, even going as far as to remove the \\"Nintendo\\" branding from the Famicom Disk System startup, replacing it with the same \\"FAMICOM\\" logo used on the system itself. ==Overview== The basic parts of the Twin Famicom include a 60-pin slot for Famicom cartridges, a slot for Disk System's Disk Cards, a switch located right below the cartridge slot which allows the player to choose between \\"\\" or \\"\\", the power button, reset button, and the eject buttons. FDS disks can be removed using the yellow button below the disk slot. The mechanism that it uses is similar to ones that are used in contemporary floppy disk drives. The eject button for cartridges is located between the power and reset buttons. It causes the cartridge to \\"pop\\" out of the slot, much like the way bread slices do when coming out of a pop-up toaster. The system does not allow both slots to be used at the same time. The switch that changes the mode from disk to cartridge works in a manner in which choosing to use the cartridge slot will block the disk drive, and vice versa. However, in some systems, only the cartridge slot will be blocked, but it is impossible to change to cartridge mode while the disk is being read. ===Specifications=== * Main Processor: Ricoh 2A03 at 1.79 MHz * RAM: 2 KB work RAM, 2 KB video RAM, 32 KB work RAM in FDS mode, 8 KB video RAM in FDS mode * ROM: FDS BIOS and 60-pin \\"cassette\\" (cartridge) slot * Audio: Six voices; two pulse wave channels, one triangle channel, one noise channel, one PCM channel, one 6-bit wavetable channel. * Graphics: Ricoh 2C02; 256×240 pixels, 64 sprites, can display 25 colors out of 53 ==Features== Red Twin Famicom variant Like all other Famicom consoles, the Twin Famicom has an expansion port that allows additional peripherals to be connected to the console such as the beam gun or an additional controller. There also is a second port of a slightly different shape for connecting another Famicom via the black RAM unit that comes with the standard Famicom Disk System. This allows a standalone Famicom to use the disk drive on the Twin Famicom. Whereas the standard Famicom only has one color combination, the Twin Famicom was initially sold in two colors: red with black highlights (AN-500R), and black with red highlights (AN-500B). A second version of the system was released in 1987 with a slightly different case design, turbo controllers, and two different color schemes; black with green highlights (AN-505-BK) and red with beige highlights (AN-505-RD). The Twin Famicom uses NTSC but with an AV output rather than a RF modulator with an RCA connector for composite video and mono audio, allowing for greater audiovisual quality on TVs and monitors with such inputs. An external RF modulator is bundled with the unit for connection through a TV's antenna/cable input. The two gamepads are hardwired into the console, so they could not be disconnected. ==See also== *Nintendo Entertainment System *C1 NES TV *Famicom Titler *Super Famicom Naizou TV SF1 ==References== ==External links== *Video of Twin Famicom features from FamicomDojo.TV *Everything2.com (for the specs) *Atari HQ Category:Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clones Category:Sharp Corporation games consoles Category:Japan-only video game hardware ","title":"Twin Famicom"},{"id":"9088145","text":"Caspi may refer to: == People == * Avshalom Caspi (born 1960), an Israeli- American psychologist * Joseph Caspi (1279—1340), a Provençal exegete, grammarian and philosopher * Matti Caspi (born 1949), an Israeli composer, musician, singer and lyricist * Nathanael ben Nehemiah Caspi (14th century-15th century), a Provençal scholar * Ram Caspi (born 1939), an Israeli attorney * Omri Casspi (born 1988), an Israeli basketball player == Ancient people == * Caspians, an ancient Iranian people dwelling along the southern and southwestern shores of the Caspian Sea. == Plants == * Botón caspi (Anthodiscus pilosus), a plant species found in Amazonian Colombia and Peru * Cachimbo caspi (Couratari guianensis), a woody plant species found in South America * Huaira caspi (Cedrelinga cateniformis), a plant species found in Peru * Leche caspi (Couma macrocarpa), a tropical plant species native to tropical, humid Central and South America * Caspi or zapallo caspi (Pisonia ambigua), a tree species native to Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil == See also == * Kaspi, a town in central Georgia ","title":"Caspi"},{"id":"9088149","text":"The Atmashatkam (, ), also known as Nirvanashatkam (निर्वाणषट्कम्, ), is a devotional composition consisting of 6 verses or ślokas (and hence the name Șaṭ-ka to mean six-verses) in Sanskrit, written by the Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara summarizing the basic teachings of Advaita Vedanta, or the Hindu teachings of non-dualism. It was written around 788-820 CE. It is said that when Ādi Śaṅkara was a young boy of eight and wandering near River Narmada, seeking to find his guru, he encountered the seer Govinda Bhagavatpada who asked him, \\"Who are you?\\". The boy answered with these stanzas, which are known as \\"Nirvāṇa Shatkam\\" or Ātma Shatkam\\". Swami Govindapada accepted Ādi Śaṅkara as his disciple. The verses are said to be valued to progress in contemplation practices that lead to Self-Realization. \\"Nirvāṇa\\" is complete equanimity, peace, tranquility, freedom and joy. \\"Ātma\\" is the True Self. ==Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam scripts== Sanskrit transliteration in IAST format. 1\\\\. :manobuddhyahaṅkāra cittāni nāhaṃ :na ca śrotrajihve na ca ghrāṇanetre :na ca vyoma bhūmir na tejo na vāyuḥ :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari: ) (Tamil: மனோ புத்தி அஹங்கார சித்தா நினாஹம், நச ஸ்ரோத்ர ஜிஹ்வே நச க்ஹ்ராண நேத்ரே  நச வ்யோம பூமிர் ந தேஜோ ந வாயு, சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: మనో బుధ్యహంకార చిత్తాని నాహం న చ శ్రోత్ర జిహ్వే న చ ఘ్రాణనేత్రే  న చ వ్యోమ భూమి ర్న తేజో న వాయుః చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ಮನೋಬುದ್ಧ್ಯಹಂಕಾರ ಚಿತ್ತಾನಿನಾಹಂ, ನ ಚ ಶ್ರೋತ್ರಜಿಹ್ವೇ ನ ಚ ಘ್ರಾಣನೇತ್ರೇ  ನ ಚ ವ್ಯೋಮ ಭೂಮಿರ್ನತೇಜೋ ನ ವಾಯುಃ, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: മനോ ബുധ്യഹംകാര ചിത്താനി നാഹം, ന ച ശ്രോത്ര ജിഹ്വാ ന ച ഘ്രാണനേത്രേ  ന ച വ്യോമ ഭൂമിർ-ന തേജോ ന വായുഃ, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) 2\\\\. :na ca prāṇasaṅjño na vai pañcavāyuḥ :na vā saptadhātur na vā pañcakośaḥ :na vākpāṇipādau na copasthapāyu :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari:) (Tamil: நச பிராண சம்ஜ்னோ ந வை பஞ்ச வாயு, ந வா சப்த தாதூர் ந வா பஞ்ச கோஷ  ந வாக் பாணி பாத்ஹவ் ந சோபஸ்த பாயு, சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: న చ ప్రాణ సంజ్ఞో న వైపంచ వాయుః న వా సప్తధాతుర్ న వా పంచ కోశాః  నవాక్పాణి పాదౌ న చోపస్థ పాయూ చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ನ ಚ ಪ್ರಾಣಸಂಜ್ಞೋ ನ ವೈ ಪಂಚವಾಯುಃ, ನ ವಾ ಸಪ್ತಧಾತುಃ ನ ವಾ ಪಂಚಕೋಶಃ  ನ ವಾಕ್ಪಾಣಿಪಾದೌ ನ ಚೋಪಸ್ಥಪಾಯು, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: ന ച പ്രാണ സംജ്ഞോ ന വൈപഞ്ചവായുഃ, ന വാ സപ്തധാതു ന വാ പഞ്ചകോശാഃ  നവാക്പാണി പാദം ന ചോപസ്ഥ പായൂ, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) 3\\\\. :na me dveşarāgau na me lobhamohau :mado naiva me naiva mātsaryabhāvaḥ :na dharmo na cārtho na kāmo na mokşaḥ :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari:) (Tamil: ந மே த்வேஷ ராகௌ ந மே லோப மோஹொவ், மதோ நைவ மே நைவ மாத்சர்ய பாவ  ந தர்மோ ந சார்தோ ந காமோ ந மொக்ஷஹ, சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: న మే ద్వేషరాగౌ న మే లోభమోహౌ మదో నైవ మే నైవ మాత్సర్యభావః  న ధర్మో న చార్ధో న కామో న మోక్షః చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ನ ಮೇ ದ್ವೇಷರಾಗೌ ನ ಮೇ ಲೋಭಮೋಹೌ, ಮದೋ ನೈವ ಮೇ ನೈವ ಮಾತ್ಸರ್ಯಭಾವಃ  ನ ಧರ್ಮೋ ನ ಚಾರ್ಥೋ ನ ಕಾಮೋ ನ ಮೋಕ್ಷಃ, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: ന മേ ദ്വേഷരാഗൗ ന മേ ലോഭമോഹോ, മദോ നൈവ മേ നൈവ മാത്സര്യഭാവഃ  ന ധർമോ ന ചാർധോ ന കാമോ ന മോക്ഷഃ, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) 4\\\\. :na puṇyaṃ na pāpaṃ na saukhyaṃ na duhkhaṃ :na mantro na tīrthaṃ na vedā na yajña :ahaṃ bhojanaṃ naiva bhojyaṃ na bhoktā :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari:) (Tamil: ந புண்யம் ந பாபம் ந சௌக்யம் ந துக்கம், ந மந்த்ரோ ந தீர்த்தம் ந வேதோ ந யஜ்னஹா  அஹம் போஜனம் நைவ போஜ்யம் ந போக்தா, சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: న పుణ్యం న పాపం న సౌఖ్యం న దుఃఖం న మంత్రో న తీర్ధం న వేదా న యజ్ఞ  అహం భోజనం నైవ భోజ్యం న భోక్తా చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ನ ಪುಣ್ಯಂ ನ ಪಾಪಂ ನ ಸೌಖ್ಯಂ ನ ದುಃಖಂ, ನ ಮಂತ್ರೋ ನ ತೀರ್ಥೋ ನ ವೇದಾ ನ ಯಜ್ಞ  ಅಹಂ ಭೋಜನಂ ನೈವ ಭೋಜ್ಯಂ ನ ಭೋಕ್ತಾ, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: ന പുണ്യം ന പാപം ന സൗഖ്യം ന ദുഃഖം, ന മന്ത്രോ ന തീർദ്ധം ന വേദാ ന യജ്ഞഃ  അഹം ഭോജനം നൈവ ഭോജ്യം ന ഭോക്താ, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) 5\\\\. :na me mṛtyuśaṅkā na me jātibhedaḥ :pitā naiva me naiva mātā na janmaḥ :na bandhur na mitraṃ gururnaiva śişyaḥ :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari:) (Tamil: ந மே மிருத்யு சங்க ந மே ஜாதி பேத, பிதா நைவ மே நைவ மாதா ந ஜன்ம  ந பந்துர் ந மித்ரம் குரூர் நைவ ஷிஷ்யாஹ், சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: న మే మృత్యు శంకా న మే జాతి భేదః పితా నైవ మే నైవ మాతా న జన్మ  న బంధు ర్న మిత్రం గురుర్నైవ శిష్యః చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ನ ಮೇ ಮೃತ್ಯುಶಂಕಾ ನ ಮೇ ಜಾತಿಭೇದಃ, ಪಿತಾ ನೈವ ಮೇ ನೈವ ಮಾತಾ ನ ಜನ್ಮಃ  ನ ಬಂಧುರ್ನಮಿತ್ರಂ ಗುರುರ್ನೈವ ಶಿಷ್ಯಃ, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: ന മൃത്യുർ-ന ശങ്കാ ന മേ ജാതി ഭേദഃ, പിതാ നൈവ മേ നൈവ മാതാ ന ജന്മഃ  ന ബംധുർ-ന മിത്രം ഗുരുർനൈവ ശിഷ്യം, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) 6\\\\. :ahaṃ nirvikalpo nirākāra rūpo :vibhutvā ca sarvatra sarvendriyāṇaṃ :na cāsaṅgataṃ naiva muktir na meyaḥ :cidānandarūpaḥ śivo'ham śivo'ham (Devanagari:) (Tamil: அஹம் நிர்விகல்போ நிராகர ரூபோ, விபுத்வாச சர்வத்ர சர்வ இந்த்ரியாணாம்  ந ச சங்கதம் நைவ முக்திர் ந மேய, சித்தானந்தா ரூப ஷிவோஹம் ஷிவோஹம்  ) (Telugu: అహం నిర్వికల్పో నిరాకార రూపో విభూత్వాచ్చ సర్వత్ర సర్వేంద్రియాణామ్  న చా సంగతం నైవ ముక్తిర్నమేయః చిదానంద రూపః శివోహం శివోహం  ) ( Kannada: ಅಹಂ ನಿರ್ವಿಕಲ್ಪೋ ನಿರಾಕಾರ ರೂಪೋ, ವಿಭುತ್ವಾಚ ಸರ್ವತ್ರ ಸರ್ವೇನ್ದ್ರಿಯಾಣಾಮ್  ನ ಚಾ ಸಂಗತ ನೈವ ಮುಕ್ತಿರ್ನ ಮೇಯಃ, ಚಿದಾನಂದರೂಪಃ ಶಿವೋಹಂ ಶಿವೋಹಂ  ) ( Malayalam: അഹം നിര്വികല്പോ നിരാകാര രൂപോ, വിഭൂത്വാച്ച സർവ്വത്ര സർവ്വേന്ദ്രിയാണാം  ന ചാ സങ്കതം നൈവ മുക്തിർന മേയഃ, ചിദാനന്ദ രൂപഃ ശിവോഽഹം ശിവോഽഹം  ) == Meaning == 1) I am not mind, nor intellect, nor ego, nor the reflections of inner self (citta).

Although it is a small village, it is home to a diverse group of local residents comprising farmers, artisans, weavers, teachers, truck drivers, professors, retired government and private sector employees and many others. Entertainment options are quite limited in the village as there are no movie theaters and village folks cannot depend on television because electricity is a huge problem. ==Facilities== It has a fully operational Post Office, something that is considered a luxury in small Indian villages. The village also has a government run subsidized fertilizer and ration shop and storage, which caters to farmers residing in adjoining villages as well. ==Transportation== Commuting is not a problem for village folks since buses, rickshaws, and taxis regularly ply on the two-lane road that connects the national highway NH 7. The nearest rail station is Chunar, which is just 8 km away, from where one can catch trains going to major cities of India. Nearest airport is Varanasi, which is about 55 km from this village. ==Economy== India’s economic growth has somehow managed to touch this seemingly remote village, evidence of which can be seen in shabbily dressed farmers using mobile phones for communicating with their friends, families and associates. Village elders vouch for the development that is currently taking place in India and have a nagging habit of informing youngsters about how they survived the rough seas and emerged unscathed when most Indian villages faced utmost poverty and famine like situations. The weary eyes of village elders tell you everything and in a way reflect the country’s social and economic history after the independence. ==Education== The village has an elementary school up to 5th grade and a girls school up to eighth grade. For higher schooling, students have to trek 3 km daily to a nearby village having schooling facilities up to 12th grade. ==Features== The areas surrounding the village are very scenic. Some of the best weekend destinations are located in and around the village. If you get to Khanzadipur, do not forget to visit the majestic Ganges, the impressive \\"Chunar Fort\\" (also known as \\"Chunargarh\\" in the famous novel \\"Chandrakanta\\" written by \\"Devki Nandan Khatri\\" [1888.]), and innumerable water falls that dot the nearby landscape.

He scored 56 goals for Newcastle's reserve and academy teams from 102 starts and 20 substitute appearances, but never appeared in a competitive first-team game. Finnigan joined Scottish Premier League club Falkirk on 23 January 2007, replacing Anthony Stokes who had left the \\"Bairns\\" to sign for Sunderland. He made his Falkirk debut, and his first appearance in a senior league, as a second-half substitute against Kilmarnock on 27 January 2007. The forward scored his first Bairns' goal three weeks later against Rangers, when he \\"played a neat one-two with Gow and drilled a shot beyond McGregor from the edge of the penalty area\\". In the 2008–09 season, he played a major role, scoring twice and winning a penalty, in Falkirk's 4–0 victory over rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle in what proved a successful fight against relegation. He also scored the winner against the same opposition to take Falkirk through to the semi- final of the Scottish Cup, and had a goal disallowed in the Cup Final. Before the 2009–10 season, Finnigan signed a new one-year contract with Falkirk, with an option for a second year. On 24 June 2011, Finnigan signed for Scottish Premier League (SPL) club St Johnstone. In February 2012, Finnigan signed on loan for Dundee. He scored on his debut for Dundee, a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Falkirk after coming on as a second-half substitute. Finnigan then scored in a 3–2 win over Livingston. Finnigan returned to St Johnstone in April 2012 following a season-ending cartilage injury, but then signed for Dundee on 1 June. In August 2013, Finnigan joined South African National First Division side Chippa United on a one-year contract. He scored on his debut on 6 October 2013 in a 1–1 draw with Thanda Royal Zulu and went on to score a total of 4 goals in 9 league appearances.

After the show, Mills signed a five- album record deal with SonyBMG. His debut album, Picture of You, was released on 12 March 2007. His debut single was advertised as \\"Beside You\\" and set to be released on 5 March 2007, but it was pulled by the record company at the last minute. The reason given was to concentrate on album sales. ==Early life and career== Mills was a co-director of a marquee hire company in his home town of Whitstable before appearing on The X Factor. He gained a diploma in music from the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford, Surrey and has been singing since he was a child. He also plays piano and guitar. He was also a keyboard player in the tribute band to The Doors called The L.A. Doors and toured the pub and club circuit with his own band called Benzego. Mills' audition song for The X Factor was \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" by Sam Cooke, which impressed the panel of judges; Simon Cowell thought he sounded like a young Joe Cocker, whom, incidentally, Ben names as one of his musical influences along with Tom Waits, Rod Stewart and David Bowie. During his time on The X Factor he was mentored by Sharon Osbourne. He performed at Pontins Holiday Camp in Blackpool, England in Oct 2008. He performed at Pontins Holiday Camp in Prestatyn, Wales in May 2009. His second album, Freedom, was released on 8 March 2010, and launched on 13 March 2010 at the Gulbenkian Theatre in Canterbury. ==Personal life== On 24 August 2007, Mills was a celebrity guest in an episode of the live television programme Doctor, Doctor broadcast on channel Five, in which he talked about his personal life and former drug-related problems with the presenter and general practitioner, Mark Porter. On live television Mills explained that he first took cocaine when he went on tour with a band, and from that moment he wanted to take more. He reported that the tour lasted for four years, that he became a heavy cocaine user, his social network became drug-orientated and he reached a nadir; he was having to borrow money, his girlfriend left him, he was not turning up for gigs, and he had lost his confidence. He said that he realised he had to change his life after spending three or four days on a beach in December, so he telephoned a counsellor who helped him to rehabilitate. After his recovery he successfully took part in The X Factor. Mills announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend, Melissa, in April 2009. They were married at Blean Church in July 2009. In June 2011, Ben performed at the Music on the Hill festival at West Malling in Kent, on behalf of Demelza Hospice Care for Children, together with Katherine Jenkins, McFly, ABC, and Björn Again. ==Discography== {class= style=text-align:center; - ! rowspan=2 Year ! rowspan=2 Album details ! colspan=2 Chart peak positions ! rowspan=2 Certifications ! rowspan=2 Sales - style=font-size:smaller; ! width=30UK ! width=30IRE -  2007  align=left Picture of You *Released: 12 March 2007 *Genre: Rock *Label: Sony BMG *Format: CD, digital download  3  15  align=left *United Kingdom: Gold  align=left *United Kingdom: 133,000 -  2010  align=left Freedom *Released: 8 March 2010 *Label: Benjamel Records *Format: CD, digital download  78  –  align=left  align=left } ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Living people Category:The X Factor (British TV series) contestants Category:English male singers Category:English rock singers Category:English rock guitarists Category:English rock pianists Category:English keyboardists Category:People from Chatham, Kent Category:Sony BMG artists Category:Musicians from Kent Category:English male guitarists Category:Male pianists Category:21st-century pianists Category:21st-century British male musicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ben Mills"},{"id":"9088198","text":"'Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Santa Maria, Bulacan Campus'.. or PUP-SMBC () is a PUP extension campus in Sitio Gulod, Brgy.

This fortress was later converted into a town for retired soldiers in 49 CE,Crummy, Philip (1984) Colchester Archaeological Report 3: Excavations at Lion Walk, Balkerne Lane, and Middleborough, Colchester, Essex. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust () and was renamed Camulodunum, a Latin rendition of the Celtic name of the site. The town was the capital of the new province of Britannia, and had several public building befitting its status. These included a theatre, a curia (council chamber), forum and a large classical-style temple. The temple's construction began during Claudius' reign, and it was dedicated to him after his death in 54 CE, with the official name of the town becoming Colonia Claudia Victricensis ('the City of Claudius' Victory') and the temple becoming the Templum Divi Claudii ('the Temple of the Deified Claudius'). The temple was the centre for the imperial cult in the province, as is mentioned in Seneca's 1st-century book the Apocolocyntosis, which mocks both the deceased Claudius and the Britons for their supposed pietyAccording to Tacitus the expenses for the temple's upkeep were among the cause of the Boudican Revolt: \\"delectique sacerdotes specie religionis omnes fortunas effundebant.\\" i.e. \\"and the chosen priests wasted whole fortunes for the cult's sake.\\" Annales 14.31 towards him.Intro to Petronius – The Satyricon/Seneca – The Apocolocyntosis (1986) Published by Penguin Classics. ()Apocolocyntosis - 8. \\"He wants to become a god: it's not enough that he has a temple in Britain, that the barbarians worship him and pray to him like to a god to obtain the benevolence of the idiot.\\" - Original Latin+Greek: Deus fieri vult: parum est quod templum in Britannia habet, quod hunc barbari colunt et ut deum orant μωροῦ εὐιλὰτου τυχεῖν ===Construction=== The podium of the temple was constructed by pouring a mix of mortar and stone into trenches cut into the ground. This base still survives today, and from the position of its load-bearing walls can be made out the superstructures layout. This appears to conform to the plans of Vitruvius in his De Architectura for a classical octastyle temple. retrieved 27/07/2014 The podium is rectangular, aligned north-south. The main chamber of the temple, the cella, was positioned at the back of the podium, and would have been a rectangular room (its length based on the position of the podium's vaults, would have been one and a quarter its width, in keeping with Vitruvian design) and was also aligned north-south, with a southern entrance. It would have had no windows and, based on Vitruvian geometry and analogies from elsewhere combined with the knowledge from the existing dimensions of the podium, would have been about high. The cellas back wall was against the back of the podium. Ten columns would have run along the east and west exterior sides of the temple, with none around the back of the chamber (peripteral style). Eight columns would have run across the front of the cella (hence \\"octastyle\\"). The pronaos in front of the cella would have had six columns along its sides. The temple was eustyle, meaning that the space between each column was two and a quarter times the diameter of the column, except for the two central columns at the front of the temple portico, which were three diameters apart. The temple is constructed from septaria obtained from the Essex coast, possibly from near Walton-on-the-Naze, and large flint nodules, whilst the roof would have been of imbrex and tegula. The columns are made from a core of curved brick, with the exterior and capitals rendered in plaster. Polished marble, including Purbeck marble and rare giallo antico from Tunisia, and stone (including tufa from the Hampshire coast) would have faced the temple, large fragments of which have been found nearby. Pieces of inscriptions on marble and large bronzed letters have been found around the site. An altar stood in front of the podium of the temple. The temple stood in the centre of a large precinct (temenos), parts of the wall of which are still visible beneath the later Norman castle bailey earthen bank. In 2014 columns from the monumental façade of the precinct were discovered behind the High Street, with plans to make them visible to the public. The entranceway to the precinct took the form of a tufa-faced wide monumental arch flanked by a columned arcade screen. Further excavations showed that the precinct was adorned with arcades and about long.Remains of 'extraordinary' Roman arcade found in Colchester ===Boudican revolt and aftermath=== The head of an Equestrian statue of Nero found in Suffolk, believed to have been taken from the Temple of Claudius, Nero's predecessor, during Boudica's revolt. In 60/1 CE the Iceni rebelled against the Romans, joined by the Trinovantes who were native to the area around Camulodunum. As the symbol of Roman rule in Britain, the colonia of Camulodunum was the first target of the rebels, with its Temple seen in British eyes as the \\"arx aeternae dominationis\\" (\\"stronghold of everlasting domination\\") according to Tacitus. The town was destroyed, with survivors taking refuge in the cella of the Temple, whose large bronze doors and strong, windowless chamber provided a safe haven. However, the rebels laid siege to the Temple, which was stormed after two days. Tacitus wrote: > In the attack everything was broken down and burnt. The temple where the > soldiers had congregated was besieged for two days and then sacked. The decapitated bronze head of a statue was found in the River Alde in Suffolk, and has been interpreted as having been taken from the Temple of Claudius by the Iceni. It has come to be identified as a bust of the Emperor Nero, who ruled during Boudica's rebellion. The town and temple were rebuilt in the years after the attack, with the colonia reaching a peak of population in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. The temple was one of the main public buildings in the town, and its façade and precinct were added to and enlarged over time. ===The temple in the Late Roman town=== In contrast to the scaling down of private buildings in the town during the 4th century, there was an increase in the size and grandeur of public buildings in the period 275-400 CE. The Temple of Claudius and its associated temenos buildings were reconstructed in the early 4th century, along with the possible forum-basilica building to the south of it. The temple appears to have had a large apsidal hall built across the front of the podium steps, with numismatic dating evidence taking the date of the building up to at least 395 CE. The changes to the temple in the 4th century may have been the result of the temple being converted to Christian use, as several Christian sites have been identified in the town from the Late Roman period,Crummy, Nina; Crummy, Philip; and Crossan, Carl (1993) Colchester Archaeological Report 9: Excavations of Roman and later cemeteries, churches and monastic sites in Colchester, 1971-88. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust () and a Roman pot shard inscribed with a Chi Rho symbol was found at the site. ===Saxon and Norman periods=== Colchester Castle keep from the south showing main entrance Plan of the first floor of Colchester Castle keep Large amounts of the superstructure of the temple were standing throughout the Saxon period, when the temple was known as King Coel's Palace. The medieval Colchester Chronicle states that the Norman architects of Colchester Castle built the structure on the remains of this \\"palace\\" in the years 1070-1080, with archaeological evidence showing that the base of the temple was used as the foundations of the castle. Evidence has been uncovered from excavations in 2014 shows that the columns of the temple precinct entrance may also have been demolished in the Norman period to allow the building of the castle's bailey. The podium was rediscovered in the 17th century when the underside of the temple's base was grubbed out, creating \\"vaults\\" under the castle. The underside of the castle was not identified as the podium of the temple until archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler examined it in the early 20th century and found that the Norman builders had clasped the castle's walls to the Roman concrete podium. Today the 17th-century \\"vaults\\" are open to visitors, showing the underside of the temple. ==See also== *List of Ancient Roman temples *Camulodunum *Augustales *Roman temple *Roman architecture *Imperial cult (ancient Rome) *Temple of Claudius, Rome ==References== ==External links== * Colchester Temples at Roman-Britain.org * The Annals of Tacitus.

His son, Sir Robert Brandling (died 1568), served as sheriff of Newcastle in 1524 and also as mayor in 1536, 1543, 1547 and 1564. In 1547, whilst mayor, he was knighted by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, following the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, in Scotland. He was Custos Rotulorum of Northumberland. Another son, Henry Brandling (1515–1578), was Sheriff of Newcastle in 1566 and mayor of the city in 1568, 1575 and 1576. His brother Thomas Brandling (1512–1590) was educated at the newly established Royal Grammar School, and founded the land and coal owning dynasty. Robert Brandling (15751636) sat in the House of Commons from 1621 to 1622. He was the son of William Brandling of Felling and Anne Helye daughter of George Heyle. His son by his first wife, Jane Wortley, Sir Francis Brandling (15951641), sat in the House of Commons from 1624 to 1625. The Brandlings had Catholic sympathies, and during the English Civil War Robert Brandling (1617–1690) served in the King's army in the rank of Colonel. With the King's fortunes waning, he escaped to Scotland where he remained until after the Restoration. He avoided sequestration of his estate and returned to England. His brother Roger, however, was killed in battle during the war. ==Estates== The family acquired by marriage Alnwick Abbey and estates at Gosforth, but by 1605 their seat had been established at Felling Hall, Felling, County Durham. The family fortunes were largely derived from the exploitation of coal reserves under their lands. Coal was worked at Felling from about 1670. The deep mine at Felling Colliery was sunk by the Brandlings in 1779. Their mines were linked to the River Tyne by wagonways. A disaster at their Felling Colliery in 1812, when 91 lives were lost, was largely responsible for the pressure to develop a miners' safety lamp. Ironically, Felling Hall fell victim to mining subsidence and had to be demolished. Other estates acquired included Shotton near Peterlee, Durham, and Middleton near Leeds in West Yorkshire. ==18th and 19th centuries== Charles Brandling (1733–1802) was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1781 and was Member of Parliament for Newcastle 1784–1798. He married Elizabeth Thompson, heiress of Shotton near Peterlee, and built a new mansion house, Shotton Hall, there in about 1760. He also built a new mansion, to a design by architect Payne, at Gosforth House between 1755 and 1764, and this house became the family seat. Charles John Brandling (1769–1826) of Gosforth was Member of Parliament for Newcastle 1798–1812 and for Northumberland 1820–1826. In 1815 he chaired the committee set up to establish the remuneration to be paid to George Stephenson for the invention of the Geordie lamp. His mining interests included Felling, Gosforth (where a deep mine was sunk in 1825), Heworth, Coxlodge, Kenton and Middleton. At Middleton he employed John Blenkinsop who in 1812 converted the wagonway from Brandling's collieries into a rack and pinion steam railway, the Middleton Railway. He overindulged in coal speculations which led to financial difficulties and the sale of many of the family's estates: Shotton in 1850, and Gosforth and Felling in 1852. Thereafter the family seat was Middleton Lodge in Yorkshire, until the 1860s. ==Bibliography== * ==References== ==External links== * History of Parliament Online, vol. 1509-1558 – Brandling, Robert (by 1498-1568) * History of Parliament Online, vol. 1558-1603 – Brandling, Sir Robert (c. 1490-1568) * History of Parliament Online, vol. 1754-1790 – Brandling, Charles (1733-1802) * History of Parliament Online, vol. 1790-1820 – Brandling, Charles (1733-1802) * History of Parliament Online, vol. 1820-1832 – Brandling, Charles John (1769-1826) Category:History of Northumberland Category:English families Category:People educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne ","title":"Brandling of Newcastle"},{"id":"9088286","text":"Pan Trafikk was a Norwegian bus company operating in and around the city of Bergen. The company was created as a merger between Åsane Billag and Bilruta Fana–Os–Milde. The company had depots in Åsane, Fana, Os and Søreide. In 1999, the company merged with Bergen Sporvei to create Gaia Trafikk,Busshistorien fortsetter bt.no November 15, 2008 which was later merged with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap, forming Tide. The company operated buses pained red in the surrounding areas around the original municipality of Bergen. Within the old city limits Bergen Sporvei had a monopoly on bus transport with its yellow buses. North of Bergen Pan had all routes between Bergen Bus Station and Åsane in addition to routes in Fana and Os. The company also operated the airport bus. The goal of Pan Trafikk was originally to operate in multiple modes of transportation (thus the name Pan, derived from the Greek Pantos meaning everywhere). This idea was instead left and focus was changed to all types of bus transport. In 1993, Pan, along with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap, Haugaland Billag and Stavanger og Omegn Trafikkselskap Kystbussen, started a NOR-WAY Bussekspress express bus between Bergen and Stavanger. When Nordhordland Bridge opened in 1994, Pan Trafikk started cooperating with the bus company in the north, Bergen Nordhordland Rutelag, replacing the old need to change bus at the ferry quay and instead both companies operating bus routes into each other's areas. In 1998 Pan started cooperating with Bergen Sporvei, both companies operating into each other areas. This later resulted in the merger between the two and the creation of Gaia Trafikk, which merged with Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap in 2006, and is now called Tide. ==References== * Entry on \\"Pan Trafikk\\" Category:Defunct bus companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Bergen Category:Bus companies of Vestland Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1992 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1999 Category:1992 establishments in Norway Category:1999 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Pan Trafikk"},{"id":"9088304","text":"All Quiet on the Preston Front is a BBC comedy drama about a group of friends in the fictional Lancashire town of Roker Bridge, and their links to the local Territorial Army infantry platoon.

In 1934, he developed the Lineweaver–Burk plot together with Hans Lineweaver.. Lineweaver and Burk collaborated with the eminent statistician W. Edwards Deming on the statistical analysis of their data: they used the plot for illustrating the results, not for the analysis itself. Dean was the second of four sons born to Frederic Burk, the founder of the San Francisco Normal School, a preparatory school for teachers which eventually became San Francisco State University. He entered the University of California at Davis at the age of 15. A year later, he transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his B.S. in Entomology in 1923. Four years later he earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry. ==Professional career== Burk joined the Department of Agriculture in 1929 working in the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory. In 1939, he joined the Cancer Institute as a senior chemist. He was head of the cytochemistry laboratory when he retired in 1974. He also taught biochemistry at the Cornell University medical school from 1939 to 1941. He was a research master at George Washington University. Burk was a close friend and co-author with Otto Heinrich Warburg.Weiterentwicklung der zellphysiologischen Methoden: angewandt auf Krebs, Photosynthese und Wirkungsweise der Röntgenstrahlung: Arbeiten aus den Jahren 1945–1961, (Thieme, Stuttgart 1962) (Trans: Further Developments of Methods in Cellular Physiology applied to Cancer, Photosynthesis and the Effects of X-ray Radiation) Texts in German and English.

Witkin (2 August 1916 – 8 July 1979) was an American psychologist who specialized in the spheres of cognitive psychology and learning psychology. He was a pioneer of the theory of cognitive styles and learning styles. He preferred to diagnose not by questionnaires but by other means, such as projective tests, task-solving tests etc. He was the author of the concept of field-dependency vs. field-independency.Staff report (July 11, 1979) Dr. Herman Witkin; Pioneered in Studies Of Learning Process. New York Times The majority of Witkin's research was done during his tenures at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center College of Medicine in Brooklyn, NY and at Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked until his death in 1979. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Witkin as the 96th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Herman Witkin studied differences in perceptual style for almost 30 years. His first book was titled Personality Through Perception (1954). The idea in this book was that personality can be revealed through differences in how people perceive their environment. Witkin was at first interested in the cues that people use in judging orientation in space. What makes one know that what one sees is a tilted object and that it is not you who are tilted? For one to find a conclusion, one examines other objects in the surroundings. In 1948, Witkin and Asch Witkin, H. A., & Asch, S. E. (1948). Studies in space orientation: IV. Further experiments on perception of the upright with displaced visual fields. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 38, 762-782. developed an apparatus called the Rod and Frame Test (RFT). When using the RFT, the participant sits in a darkened room where he or she receives instructions about watching a glowing rod surrounded by a glowing square frame. The researcher can manipulate both the rod, the frame and the participant's chair in different angles of tilts. The participant is then instructed to adjust the rod so that the rod is perfectly upright. For the participant to be able to do this, he/she has to ignore cues in the visual field. If the participant adjusts the rod so that it is leaning in the direction of the tilted frame, then that person is said to be dependent on the visual field. This person will be categorized as field-dependent. On the other side there will be people who are field-independent. These people will disregard the external cues, and use information from their bodies in adjusting the rod to appear upright. Field- independent people seem to rely on their own sensations instead of the perception of the field, to make a judgment. The Rod and Frame Test is a difficult and time-consuming method for revealing field-dependence and -independence. Witkin therefore developed the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). This test also measures field dependence without relying on the cumbersome Rod and Frame Test. An example of an EFT is a picture with many hidden figures which you are supposed to find. Field-independent people will quickly be able to find the hidden figures, while field-dependent people will have trouble locating the simple figures embedded within the more complex surroundings. Witkin found a strong correlation between the Performance on the EFT.Randy J. Larsen & David M. Buss Personality Psychology 3rd edition Field independence- dependence has been linked to many traits. People who are field dependent have many more utterances per unit time in conversation with other field dependent people than do field independent people. Field dependent folks have better memories for faces. Field independent people have better memories for numbers. One paradigm experiment involved college students. In the experiment, the subject arrived late (by premeditation) at a psychology experiment in which the other 'subjects' were asked to rate whether two lines were of equal length or unequal. The only seat for the subject was at the end of the semi-circle of other subjects, all of whom had been prompted how to respond to the prompt. Even when the lines were of clearly unequal length, the 'stooges' replied that the lines were of equal length. Subjects who were field-dependent also agreed that the lines were equal. Field independent subjects asserted the lines were unequal, even when the differences were very small. Field independence- dependence has been demonstrated in many cultures worldwide and appears to be bi-modal, although with advancing age it appears to drift toward the middle of the distribution. After Witkin's death, little research was done on field independence-dependence. However, new research began to appear in the beginning of the 1990s. Among the contributors were Vrij, van der Steen & Koppelaar (1995) and Linda Bastone & Heather Wood (1997). ==References== ==External links== * Short biography in Spanish * The Model of field- dependency and field-independency Category:1916 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American psychologists Category:American Jews Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Herman Witkin"},{"id":"9088341","text":"Godsend may refer to: ==People== * Godsend, codename for Oscar Seborer (1921–2015), atomic spy for the Soviet Union (1941–1951) ==Literature== *The Godsend, 1976 novel by Bernard Taylor ==Film== *The Godsend (film), a 1980 British horror film adapted from Bernard Taylor's novel * Godsend (2004 film), a 2004 American/Canadian science fiction horror film * Godsend (2014 film), a 2014 South Korean drama film * \\"Godsend\\" (Heroes), an episode of the television series Heroes ==Other media== *Godsend, album from Nancy Wilson discography 1984 ","title":"Godsend"},{"id":"9088348","text":"Daani is a Pakistani film by Khalid Ahmed and Farooq Rind.

The abbey played an important role in the religious, political and religious life of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, especially around the year 1000. In addition to its founder St Landelin, 4 other saints are said \\"of Lobbes\\".http://catholicsaints.info/lobbes-abbey/ ==HistoryFoundation=== 230px 230px 230px The early history of Lobbes Abbey is known in relative detail because fortunately, and unlike with most abbeys, the ancient annals survived.the Annales Laubicenses, printed in G. H. Pertz, Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores The monastery was founded by Saint Landelin around 650. Landelin was a young man from a well-to-do family in Bapaume, who lived a sinful life as the head of a band of brigands. After repenting, he founded a monastery at the place where he had committed his sins, at the shores of the river Sambre. The number of monks at the new monastery increased rapidly and the founder grew tired of his duties as an abbot, so in 680 he resigned from his post and dedicated the rest of his life to the worship of God. ===Early fame=== Landelin was succeeded by Ursmar (Saint Ursmarus) who devoted himself to preaching Christianity among the largely pagan Franks. The fame of Saint Ursmarus and his successors Ermin of Lobbes, Abel of Reims and Theodulph of Lobbes, made Lobbes the most important monastery in Belgium of the time. Under Anson, the 6th abbot (776-800), the abbey school rose to great fame. In 864 Hucbert, brother-in-law of Lothair II of Lotharingia, became lay abbot. Through his decadent lifestyle he almost brought the monastery to destitution. His successor, Franco, was both abbot of Lobbes and bishop of Liège, a situation that continued until 960. The abbey basically became a fief of the Bishop of Liège, although ecclesiastically it was situated in the bishopric of Cambrai. In 954 the abbey was raided and burned during the Hungarian invasions of Europe. Under the abbots Folcuin (965-990), Heriger of Lobbes (990-1007) and Hugo (1033–1053), the abbey and the school once again attained a great reputation. ===Decline=== After this period the fame of the abbey gradually declined, until the monastic revival originating from the Bursfelde Congregation brought fresh life in the 15th century. In 1569 Lobbes, St. Vaast's Abbey in Arras, and several other abbeys, were combined to form the Benedictine Congregation of Exempt Monasteries of Flanders. ===Dissolution=== In 1794, the last abbot, Vulgise de Vignron, and 43 monks were expelled from the monastery by French revolutionary troops. Under the law of 2 September 1796 the abbey was dissolved. Most of the monastic buildings, including the abbey church of Saint Peter, were destroyed. The former burial church of Saint Ursmarus survived as a parish church. A few other minor buildings were later incorporated into a railway station. ==Art historical significance== The church of Saint Ursmarus is one of the oldest churches in Belgium. The oldest parts date from Carolingian or Ottonian times. The choir and crypt are Romanesque and stand out by their simplicity. The crypt contains the tombs of Saint Ursmarus and Saint Erminus, as well as tombstones from other abbots. The westwork tower is a typical example of Mosan architecture. The pointed spire was added in the 19th century. From 1865 until 1870 the church was restored by the architect Eugène Carpentier, who basically rebuilt large sections of the church and removed all traces of earlier situations. Today the Abbey library stored a copy of \\"Lobbes Bible\\" completed in 1084 AD and a digitized copy is available on line at IRHT (see Lobbes Bible).

In the knee, it can happen after knee injury or surgery. There is excessive scar tissue formation within the joint and surrounding soft tissues leading to painful restriction of joint motion that persists despite physical therapy and rehabilitation. The scar tissue can involve only a part of the knee joint or the whole knee. The scar tissue may be located inside the knee joint or may involve the soft tissue structures around the knee joint. Arthrofibrosis may arise without an obvious cause or it may follow a known cause. == Arthrofibrosis of the knee (Frozen Knee) == Arthrofibrosis of the knee, also called as \\"Frozen Knee\\", has been one of the more studied joints as a result of its frequency of occurrence. Arthrofibrosis can follow knee injury and knee surgeries like arthroscopic knee surgery or knee replacement. Scar tissues can cause structures of the knee to become contracted, restricting normal motion. Depending on the site of scarring, knee cap mobility and/or joint range of motion (i.e. flexion, extension, or both) may be affected. Symptoms experienced as a result of arthrofibrosis of the knee include stiffness, pain, limping, heat, swelling, crepitus, and/or weakness. Clinical diagnosis may also include the use of magnetic resonance imaging (or MRI) to visualize the knee compartments affected. The consequent pain may lead to the cascade of quadriceps weakness, patellar tendon shortening and scarring in the tissues around the knee cap--with an end stage of permanent patella infera--where the knee cap is pulled down into an abnormal position where it becomes vulnerable to joint surface damage. == Arthrofibrosis after knee injury, knee arthroscopy or other surgeries== The first step in treating arthrofibrosis is appropriately directed physical therapy. There are several potential treatments for arthrofibrosis. Treatment varies on the cause and duration of the fibrosis. Often physical therapy is used as an attempt at conservative management. If physical therapy fails options include: manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA), arthroscopic lysis of adhesions, open lysis of adhesions, or in the case of long standing fibrosis in the setting of knee arthroplasty (knee replacement) a revision open surgery may be needed. == Arthrofibrosis after knee replacement == Arthrofibrosis can occur after total knee replacement or partial knee replacement. The common pathway for the development of arthrofibrosis (AF) is excessive collagen fibril deposition in and around the knee. This can be accompanied by shortening of the patellar tendon (patella baja/infera) which can also contribute to limited flexion. The rates of AF after TKA vary widely in the literature as there is no standard definition. One study's definition is a total range of motion (ROM) <90 degrees constitutes AF, another definition is flexion contracture >10 degrees, or inability to flex the knee >100 degrees. AF is a diagnosis of exclusion; before making a final diagnosis of arthrofibrosis, other causes of stiffness following knee replacement should be excluded (ex: infection, malposition of the implants, or mechanical block to motion). In the case of AF after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) management typically consists of attempt at aggressive physical therapy, and in the case that fails manipulation under anesthesia (MUA). The rates of MUA after TKA vary widely. There are several reasons for this: there is no definite consensus to when a MUA is required (different surgeons follow different indications), there is no standardized definition of arthrofibrosis (see above), and depending on how and when it is performed MUA is not always a reliable treatment. For these reasons treatment patterns vary widely. Successful MUA depends on many variables. MUA after TKA has been found to be most successful if performed in the first 8-12 weeks after surgery. After 12 weeks manipulation is much less likely to have an acceptable outcome. If the fibrosis is chronic (more than 12 weeks) there is a decreased likelihood of success with MUA and an increased chance of success with open lysis of adhesions or revision surgery, however this carries with it the attendant risks of another open procedure (i.e., infection, blood clots, blood loss, etc). == References == == External links == Category:Gross pathology http://kneearthrofibrosis.com http://www.kneeguru.co.uk/KNEEnotes/primers/complications-rehabilitation/key- arthrofibrosis-resources-kneeguru-site ","title":"Arthrofibrosis"},{"id":"9088412","text":"Safari School is a BBC Two reality television series presented by Dr Charlotte Uhlenbroek in which eight celebrities take part in a four-week ranger training course in the Shamwari Game ReserveShamwari Game Reserve in South Africa. ==Synopsis== The celebrities have to learn how to become game rangers.

KTUAS had a variety of 18 degree programmes, in five of which the language of tuition and studying was English. Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences has won international recognition for its eLearning programmes. ==History == Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences was established in 1992. At the moment there are altogether 2,600 students and the staff consists of approximately 250 persons. Kemi and Tornio are situated in the Finnish Lapland, by the Swedish border. The Kemi-Tornion region offers a wide range of services. The people of Kemi and Tornio derive their livelihood from the paper and wood industries, steel industries, high-tech enterprises and engineering works. Kemi-Tornio UAS considers its most important task to be the training of entrepreneurial spirited, highly skilled people, who understand the conditions and possibilities of the North. The UAS provides education for the young and adults leading to Bachelor’s and master's degrees in the fields of business and administration, culture, technology, health care and social services and natural sciences. KTUAS has a variety of 18 degree programmes, in five of which the language of teaching and studying is English. From the student’s point of view, the strengths of the Kemi-Tornio UAS are modern technology and know-how in eLearning, co-operation with the business and working life both in Finland and abroad as well as internationalization. The Kemi-Tornio UAS has developed a broad and active network for international co-operation opening up opportunities for students to complete part of their Bachelor’s thesis and practical training abroad. The University supports the development of students’ personal professional skills with versatile teaching methods as well as independent study through supportive guidance. ==The Fields of Study == * Business Administration * Cultural and Media Arts * Information Communication Technology (ICT) * Health Care and Social Services * Technology ===International Bachelor’s Degree Programmes=== * Degree Programme in Business Management * Degree Programme in Business Information Technology * Degree Programme in Social Services * Degree Programme in Nursing ===International Master’s Degree Programmes=== * International Business Management ==R & D== The purpose of the Research and Development department is to create and advance internationalization strategy and to be responsible for integrating international activities with the research and studies at Kemi- Tornio University of Applied Sciences. The role of the department is to consult as well as to create and execute projects and to operate as a project organization where the physical location of workers is not relevant when carrying out the operations. The operations of Research and Development department are especially targeted to certain areas of focus. These areas of focus include The Nordic Countries and the neighboring North Calotte Area, as well as the familiar collaboration area of European Union countries, but on a wider scale than previously. Resources are also aimed at cooperation with Russia and particularly with the Barents region. The central field of operation of Research and Development department is the EU -project work. The basis for acquiring and implementing projects is engaging them as an integral part of the applied research of the UAS. The project leaders and other needed workers are recruited mainly from the personnel of the UAS, in which case the project experiences can be directly utilized in education. This way the project working contributes also teachers’ acquisition of qualifications and further education. By means of the projects, opportunities will be provided for the students to complete theses and carry out practical training periods. A substantial element of the project work is the international collaboration realized with the local commercial and industry life. The objectives of this form of activity are to develop both regional enterprises and public sector, to enhance employment and create connections to international companies and other partners in cooperation by utilizing the possibilities information society provides. ===Strategic fields of expertise=== In Industrial Lapland KTUAS develops know-how in * maintenance, * product development and * enterprise resource management (ERP). In Lapland of Well being, KTUAS develops multidisciplinary know-how in preventive and re-rehabilitative work in * elderly care * welfare of children, young people and families * occupational health * regional research and development of welfare services. In Lapland of Experiments and Culture KTUAS invests in * social media know-how and founding Northern Culture Institute * In Lapland of Business and Entrepreneurship KTUAS develops know-how in * international business and new business operations models and * software design and software business. ===IT LAB=== IT Laboratory located in Minerva (ATK 9) is owned by the Department of Information Processing. Several students from various groups make their practical placement at this place. The goal of the IT lab is to apply theoretical knowledge in practical life and get in touch with business life of the region working with real tasks from companies. Services provided by IT Lab are: * Website designing (From simple websites to eCommerce & social media sites, booking and reservation system, video solution etc.) * Content management system * Web application development * e-Commerce development * PC services, maintenance and repair * Software installation * Mobile applications etc.. ===LIIKE=== LIIKE combines the competences of companies, teachers and students into innovative development projects based on the demands of companies. For students of KTUAS LIIKE is a new way of learning by developing solutions to real work-related problems. In LIIKE tasks, studying is directly related to the professional working life in the field of study in question. Local companies as customers are really interested in the outcomes of student’s studies. Smaller development projects at the beginning of the studies lead into more challenging LIIKE tasks during practical training and thesis work. For deserving participants this creates better opportunities for employment after graduation. ==eLearning Centre== The eLearning Centre of Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences was created in the year 2000 concurrent with the Finnish policy towards the creation of the foremost information and knowledge society in Europe. Although administratively the centre is a support unit of the University of Applied Sciences, it serves all organizations associated with the Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Education and Training Consortium Lappia. The eLearning Centre’s main tasks have concerned the adoption and administration of online learning environments (presently Moodle and iLinc) and both pedagogical and technical instruction and support for students and staff endeavouring to learn and teach in these environments. The eLearning Centre also initiates and participates in research and development projects in the fields of electronic and distance education such as the Finnish Virtual Polytechnic. One of the fruits of that labour was the creation of the award-winning eDegree concept for distant learners in Lapland and Finland at large. == External links == * Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences * Department of Information processing * Academy website ==See also== *List of polytechnics in Finland ==References== Category:Universities and colleges in Finland University of Applied Sciences University of Applied Sciences Category:Vocational education Category:Education in Lapland (Finland) ","title":"Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences"},{"id":"9088470","text":"Juan Carlos Mareco and co-star Mariquita Gallegos in Otras pinochadas (1965).

The Arya Samaj encouraged Indian South Africans to take pride in their heritage and culture and promoted education and social reform. ==HistoryEarly preachers and missionaries === Bhai Parmanand, the first Arya Samaj missionary to arrive in South Africa, arrived on 5 August 1905. During his four-month stay, he travelled to Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. He was a dynamic orator in both English and Hindi and was received with enthusiasm by the local Indian community, including Mahatma Gandhi. He delivered discourses on Hindu culture, religion, Indian civilisation, faith in God, ceremonies, the importance of the mother tongue and education. He emphasised the importance and significance of festivals and since then Deepavali has come to be recognised as a festival of Hindus. He established grassroots Arya Samaj committees to consolidate Hinduism amongst the Indians, established the Hindu Reform Society of Durban and the Hindu Young Men's Association in Pietermaritzburg and motivated the formation of the Hindu Maha Sabha, an organisation bringing together the diverse Hindu groups under one banner. Swami Shankaranand, who arrived in South Africa on 4 October 1908, urged Hindus to have pride in their religion and stressed the importance of religious lectures, rites and the study of Indian vernaculars. He succeeded in making Deepavali, the birth of Lord Rama and the birth of Lord Krishna important dates in the Hindu calendar. He founded Veda Dharma Sabhas in Durban and Pietermaritzburg but his greatest contribution was the establishment of the Hindu Maha Sabha in 1912. The first locally born Arya Samaj activist was Pundit Bhawani Dayal, who returned from India at the age of twenty in 1912. He preached the Vedic religion and pioneered the propagation of Hindi in South Africa. He and his wife, involved themselves in Gandhi's satyagraha and were both imprisoned. In 1916, he organised a Hindi literary conference in Ladysmith and was the editor of two local Hindi language newspapers. Another preacher, Swami Mangalanand Puri, came to Natal in 1913. He delivered lectures under the auspices of the Arya Yuvak Sabha and proved to be an eloquent Hindi orator. During his time, he attracted many young men who joined the Arya Samaj. In 1921 Pundit Ishwardutt Vedalankar, a graduate of Gurukul Kangadi (in India), came to Natal under the banner of the Arya Yuvak Sabha. As an eloquent speaker he attracted large audiences of all faiths. He concentrated on the correct performance of religious ceremonies and drew large crowds at Ramayan recitals. === Establishment of a central organisation === By the beginning of the 1920s, a number of Arya Samajs had been established in Natal. Under the guidance of D.G. Satyadeva, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha in Natal was established on 22 February 1925, with its headquarters in Durban. The first officials elected were Pt Bhawani Dayal (President), B A Maghrajh (Secretary), P R Pather (assist Secretary), and R K Kaptain (Treasurer). Two years later on 23 October 1927, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Natal, was to affiliated to the Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (International Arya League). == Aims and activities of Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (SA) == The aims of Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (SA) are to encourage the establishment, organisation and consolidation of Arya Samajs and Vedic institutions in South Africa, elucidate the tenets of Arya Samaj and to foster these principles in the country, disseminate Vedic religion and philosophy, promote the art, culture and civilisation of India, encourage and advocate the study of Hindi and other Indian languages, protect and defend the rights of Hindus and to concern itself with their spiritual, moral and social upliftment, and to co-operate with other Hindu organisations on matters affecting the Hindu Community. === Visiting preachers and missionaries === Many learned Vedic scholars and highly trained preachers visited South Africa under the auspices of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha to promote Vedic Culture. These included: * Professor Ralaram of D A V College, Hoshiarpur, India who arrived in 1931 and delivered lectures on the Vedic religion. * Mehta Jaimini who arrived in 1934 and launched the South African Hindu Maha Sabha. * Pundit Anand Priyaji, who arrived with a contingent of girls' guides from Arya Kanya Mahavidyalaya of Baroda, India, and gave a display of physical culture, sang national and religious songs and through their forceful impressive speeches spread the teachings of the Vedic Religion. * Professor Yashpal in 1937 and demonstrated the powers of Yoga. * Pundit Rishiram visited South Africa in 1937 and 1945 and carried out teachings based on the Vedas, Upanishads and Gita. === Veda Niketan === The Veda Niketan concentrates on the dissemination of the Vedic religion by means of publication of literature and production of any material e.g. cassettes - audio and video, compact discs, software, websites and conducts a series of graded examinations on Hindu Dharma. === Vedic Purohit Mandal === The Vedic Purohit Mandal (Academy of Vedic Priests) conducts systematic classes for the training of priests regardless of caste, creed, gender or colour. The Mandal enjoys a large membership of women priests. === Hindi Education === Arya Samaj has always encouraged the teaching of Hindi. In 1925, an organisation for the promotion of Hindi within the Arya Samaj, the Hindi Siksha Sangh (Hindi Education Union) was established. The Sangh established a uniform syllabus, conducted Hindi classes and wrote examinations. == External links == * Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of South Africa * Pratinidhi Arya Sabha Nederland * Veda Dharma Sabha, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa *Arya Samaj Pandit Ji India == References == * Category:Arya Samaj Category:Hinduism in South Africa ","title":"Arya Samaj in South Africa"},{"id":"9088485","text":"Happysad (stylized as happysad) is a Polish rock band created in Skarżysko- Kamienna in 2001.

It is the only museum in the Netherlands dedicated to Jewish history. ==History== The Joods Historisch Museum opened its doors on 24 February 1932 and was initially housed at the Waag (Weighing House) on Nieuwmarkt square. Following the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, the museum was forced to close and much of the collection was lost. The museum reopened its doors in 1955. In 1987, it moved to a new location, occupying four former synagogues on Jonas Daniël Meijerplein square, across the road from the Snoge or Portuguese Synagogue (for which joint tickets are sold). The museum was recognized in 1989 when it received the Council of Europe Museum Prize, awarded for a combination of the presentation of the collection and the outward appearance of the buildings. A seven-year renovation of the museum was completed in 2007. ==Collection and exhibitions== The exhibition of Roman Vishniac's photos at Amsterdam Jewish Historical Museum, 2014. The museum's collection includes some 11,000 art objects, ceremonial objects and historical objects, only some five percent of which is on display at any one time. It has two permanent exhibitions as well as regularly changing temporary exhibitions. The exhibition on the ground floor focuses on Jewish traditions and customs. The presentation is inspired by the former interior of the synagogue. Ceremonial objects from the museum collection are shown in locations where they used to be placed in the synagogue. This gives visitors a sense of the surroundings in which they find themselves and enables them to taste the original synagogue atmosphere. In 2014 the museum presented an exclusive exhibition of Roman Vishniac's photos. The photographer is famous for capturing the life of Jews during the world war. The galleries of the Great Synagogue feature a new presentation on the history of the Jews of the Netherlands from 1600 to 1890. The central theme is what it meant to be a Jew in the Netherlands in this period. Stories about how Jews arrived in the Netherlands, the extent to which they managed to integrate, the cultural interchange with non-Jewish countrymen and the preservation of their identity resonate today in contemporary situations and debates.

He inherited the estate of his grandmother, Anne Adele Hope (widow of Henry Thomas Hope) in 1884, upon condition that he assume the name and arms of Hope upon reaching his majority; he did so in 1887 and became known as Lord Francis Hope. This bequest included the well-known Hope Diamond. Lord Francis held a commission as Lieutenant of the Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry until he resigned in April 1894. He was Sheriff of Monaghan for 1897 and 1917. He married American actress May Yohé in November 1894. She had gained fame on the London stage in 1893 and 1894, especially in the burlesque Little Christopher Columbus.

Stretching over Oxhålssundet, it connects Stora Essingen island to the western suburb Bromma. Built 1996-1998 by the Nordic Construction Company at a cost of 180 million SEK, it has served the Tvärbanan light rail line and pedestrians and bicyclists since its inauguration in August 2000. The name is derived from Alvik, originally a local manor house built in 1819 and demolished in 1930. The bridge is 400 metres in length with a 140-metre central span and a horizontal clearance of 24 metres. The underside of the bridge tie forms an arch intended to make the bridge as slender as possible. The two pillars standing in the water each consist of two thin concrete plates dressed in two-quarters brick with a common concrete foundation. They are illuminated after dark. The construction is pre-tensioned longitudinally by cables, but non-tensioned across. The topside was stretched as the separate sections were added, while the underside was stretched after all the sections had been cast into a single compact unit. Three years after the inauguration crack formations were discovered in the bridge. The shear fissures in the ribs had an angle of 25-30° and a length of 0.1-0.3 mm, and were found in greater number on the south side. This is thought to indicate that compressive stress from the longitudinal stressing in combination with heat from the sun caused the problem. The bridge was then reinforced, first temporarily using outside pre-stressing bars, and then permanently using carbon fibre laminates in sections with minor fissures, and tie struts in the worst affected sections. == See also == * List of bridges in Stockholm * Skansbron * Gröndalsbron * Fredriksdalsbron == References == == External links == * flickr - Photo of Alviksbron in winter (January 2006) Category:Bridges in Stockholm Category:Bridges completed in 1998 Category:Box girder bridges ","title":"Alviksbron"},{"id":"9088582","text":"Atlanta is an unincorporated community in the western United States, located in Elmore County, Idaho. Historical Home in Atlanta It was founded in 1864 during the Civil War as a gold and silver mining community and named by Southerners after a rumored Confederate victory over General Sherman in the Battle of Atlanta, which turned to be wholly false, but the name stuck. Mining activity near Atlanta preceded its establishment as a mining community. The John Stanley party discovered gold on the nearby Yuba River on July 20, 1864, just two days prior to the battle back in Georgia. That November, John Simmons made the discovery of the Atlanta lode which contained both gold and silver. Atlanta is at an elevation of above sea level, surrounded by the Boise National Forest; it is near the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Boise River, approximately east of the mouth of the Yuba River. The Sawtooth Mountains are directly north, the Sawtooth Wilderness starts about a mile (1.6 km) north of Atlanta, at the base of Greylock Mountain, which summits at . Idaho City is approximately due west, as the crow flies. Galena Summit on State Highway 75 is about to the east-northeast. Atlanta is about from two paved highways. It is east of State Highway 21, accessed on unimproved U.S. Forest Service roads. Atlanta is north of U.S. Highway 20, which is accessed from Atlanta by heading south on USFS roads through Rocky Bar, Featherville, and Pine. The junction with US-20 is just east of the Anderson Ranch Reservoir on the South Fork of the Boise River Atlanta can also be accessed by following the unimproved road from Arrowrock Dam which climbs with the Middle Fork of the Boise River. Though founded as a mining community, and a number of private claims remain in the area, no significant commercial mining has occurred in the area for over 50 years, though more recently inquiries into opening a new plant have seen some headway. In place of mining, Atlanta has diversified into areas such as tourism, back-country activities, and preservation of the town's lengthy historic legacy. In the summer months The Atlanta School offers arts and architecture workshops and artist residencies. The Atlanta Historic District, a historic district including 12 contributing buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. ==Climate== This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Atlanta has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Atlanta, Idaho ==Gold mining history== Gold was discovered in 1863, and placer mining started along the Yuba River in 1864. The Atlanta Lode quartz outcrop was discovered in Nov. 1864. Discovery of the Minerva, Tahoma, Last Chance, and Big lodes, with the development of the Buffalo, Monarch, General Pettit and other mines, soon followed. The Monarch Gold and Silver Mining Co. operated from 1866 until 1869. Arastras initially processed the gold ore, neglecting the silver, as did the early stamp mills. Even the introduction of the Washoe process in 1869 at the Monarch, only resulted in the recovery of 20%. Lantis & Company took over the Monarch property in 1874. The Buffalo mill achieved 55% recovery in 1877. This led to a building boom, as the Buffalo mill and the Monarch employed 60 employees in total, the Atlanta community grew to 500, and a road was constructed to Rocky Bar. Yet, by 1884, most high- grade ore had been processed, and by 1885, Lantis & Company had sunk the Monarch mine shaft to a depth of . The Atlanta Mines Co. purchased the Monarch Mine in 1902, followed by the Buffalo and Last Chance mines. The company built a 150-ton mill connected to the mine via an aerial tramway, and powered by a hydroelectric plant west of Atlanta. In 1932, the Saint Joseph Lead Company improved the recovery process by introducing an amalgamation-flotation concentrator, ushering in an era of modern production. The Middle Fork road connected Boise with Atlanta in 1938. Talache Mines, Inc., acquired all of the mining operations along the Atlanta Lode in 1939. Mining operations ceased in 1953. The Atlanta Gold Corporation of America acquired the lease in 1985. ==See also== *Atlanta Airport (Idaho) *Idaho Batholith *Rocky Bar, Idaho ==References== * * * ==External links== * * The Atlanta School.org – The Atlanta School * Visit Idaho.org – Atlanta * Idaho Heritage.org – Atlanta Pioneer Cemetery * You Tube.com – landing in Atlanta, Idaho * KTVB.com – Exploring another Idaho gem, Atlanta * Flickr.com – photos of Atlanta, Idaho Category:Unincorporated communities in Elmore County, Idaho Category:Populated places established in 1864 Category:Unincorporated communities in Idaho Category:1864 establishments in Idaho Territory ","title":"Atlanta, Idaho"},{"id":"9088611","text":"Lady Noreen Elizabeth Murray (; 26 February 1935 - 12 May 2011).. was an English molecular geneticist who helped pioneer recombinant DNA technology (genetic engineering) by creating a series of bacteriophage lambda vectors into which genes could be inserted and expressed in order to examine their function. During her career she was recognised internationally as a pioneer and one of Britain's most distinguished and highly respected molecular geneticists. Until her 2001 retirement she held a personal chair in molecular genetics at the University of Edinburgh.. She was president of the Genetical Society, vice president of the Royal Society, and a member of the UK Science and Technology Honours Committee. ==Education== Noreen Parker was brought up in the village of Read, Lancashire, then from the age of five in Bolton-le- Sands. She was educated at Lancaster Girls' Grammar School, at King's College London (BSc), and received her PhD from the University of Birmingham in 1959. ==Career== Murray was a committed researcher. She worked at Stanford University, University of Cambridge, and the Medical Research Council (UK) before first joining the University of Edinburgh faculty in 1967. She briefly moved to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory from 1980–82, but returned to Edinburgh where she was awarded a personal chair of Molecular Genetics in 1988. At Edinburgh, she produced a considerable body of work focused on uncovering the mechanisms and biology of restriction enzymes, and their adaptation as tools underpinning modern biological research. It is notable that she has many single author publications; she was generally the main instigator and sole technical contributor. In 1968 Noreen had become interested in the phenomenon of host-controlled restriction (the ability of bacterial cells to \\"restrict\\" foreign DNA) and decided to study this phenomenon in Escherichia coli using bacteriophage lambda and her knowledge of bacteriophage genetics. She was married to Sir Kenneth Murray,. also a noted biochemist with whom she helped develop a vaccine against hepatitis B, the first genetically-engineered vaccine approved for human use. She, Ken and colleague Bill Brammar, led the development of genetic engineering, putting the UK ahead in revolutionary DNA research. Noreen and Ken were among the first to realise that the ability to cut DNA with restriction enzymes made it possible to join together different DNA molecules to produce recombinant DNA molecules, and clone DNA sequences. Their work had a lasting impact and shaped all areas of biology and biotechnology. In their published work together, Noreen's contributions are clearly identifiable; she being the geneticist, he the biochemist. Her obituary describes the impact she made on fellow women scientists in her workplace .'Her achievements came at a time when it was not always easy for women to make a career in science, and it is a measure of her ability and determination that she reached the top of her profession despite occasionally contending with the unconscious prejudice of the scientific establishment. Perhaps because of this Noreen was particularly attentive to the careers of her female colleagues and delighted in their success.' 'She was an exceptional mentor to those who worked with or around her.' In 1983 the couple established the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. To this trust they donated the royalty earnings from the Hepatitis B vaccine. The charity supports education and research in natural science. This Trust has provided funds to construct the University of Edinburgh Darwin Library, to contribute to building the Michael Swann Building, and provided numerous bursaries to support postgraduates and undergraduates from overseas to study in Edinburgh. In 2009, Noreen joined the Advisory Panel of Edinburgh bioscience firm BigDNA, which designs and develops vaccines based on the lambda phage carrying DNA- based vaccines.

Bronze statue of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva from Gandhara. 3rd–4th century. Buddhism in Pakistan took root some 2,300 years ago under the Mauryan king Ashoka. Buddhism has played a major role in the history of Pakistan — the land of which over time has been part of predominantly Buddhist empires such as the Indo-Greek Kingdom, the Kushan Empire, the Maurya Empire of Ashoka, the Pala Empire. In 2012, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) indicated that the contemporary Buddhist population of Pakistan was minuscule with 1,492 adult holders of national identity cards (CNICs). The total population of Buddhists is therefore unlikely to be more than a few thousand. In 2017, number of Buddhist voters was stated to be 1,884 and they are mostly concentrated in Sindh and Punjab.https://www.hindustantimes.com/world- news/pakistan-elections-non-muslim-voters-up-by-30-hindus-biggest- minority/story-gRmBeL4TaBBgY6ZTURRA7M.html The only functional Buddhist temple in Pakistan is in the Diplomatic Enclave at Islamabad, used by Buddhist diplomats from countries like Sri Lanka. ==Buddhism in antiquityRegions=== Gilgit Baltistan  Buddha from the Kahu-jo-daro stupa displayed in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. Buddhist Cave city Gondhrani, Balochistan. Buddhism came to this part of the country in the late 7th century when most of the masses were practicing Bon religion. Before the arrival of Islam, Tibetan Buddhism and Bön (to a lesser extent) were the main religions in Baltistan. Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the Manthal Buddha Rock, a rock relief of the Buddha at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the Sacred Rock of Hunza. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters. Baltistan had Buddhist majority till the 15th century, before the arrival of Islam in this region. Since then most of the people converted to Islam, the presence of Buddhism in this region has now been limited to archeological sites, as the remaining Buddhists of this region moved east to Ladakh where Buddhism is the majority religion.  Gandhara  The majority of people in Gandhara, present-day Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, were Buddhist. Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist, but also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism. The Swat Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat. Buddhist scholar Kumāralabdha of the Taxila was comparable to Aryadeva, Aśvaghoṣa and Nagarjuna.  Uddiyana  The Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District, which was then a part of Oddiyana. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.  Punjab region  Buddhism was practiced in the Punjab region, with many Buddhist monastery and stupa sites in the Taxila World Heritage Site locale. It was also practiced in the Sindh regions.  Sindh  Buddhist sites in Sindh are numerous but ill preserved and various stages of deterioration. Sites at Brahmanabad (Mansura Sanghar district, Buddhist stupa at mohen jo daro, Sirah-ji-takri near Rohri, Sukkur, Kahu Jo Daro at Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah, Sudheran jo Thul near Hyderabad, Thul Mir Rukan stupa, Thul Hairo Khan Stupa and Bhaleel Shah Thul square stupas (5th-7th century A.D) at Dadu, Kot Bambhan Thul buddhist tower near Tando Muhammad Khan. Many terracota tiles from Kaho jo Daro and Buddha statues are exhibited in Chatrapati Shivaji museum, Mumbai.  Balochistan  Chinese Buddhist traveller Hiuen Tsang reported many Buddhist temples in coastal regions of Makran, Balochistan. The remains of Buddhist cave city called Godrani Caves can still be seen today. ==Demographics== The presence of Pakistani Buddhists in modern pakistan is unclear,Thread, Not Scissor Common Spiritual Heritage For Peace And Harmony, Ahmad Salim, SARRC – December 2008 although a few Pakistanis have reported themselves as Buddhist. A report mentions that they are only found in the Azad Kashmir region.800 years of Buddhism in Pakistan, Emi Foulk, The Friday Times, July 18, 2008 The Nurbakhshi sect is said to retain some elements of Buddhism. According to the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) in 2012 there 1,492 buddhists in holding national identity cards (CNICs). In 2017 it increased to 1,884 holders. They are mostly concentrated in Sindh and Punjab. According to a report most of the Baori Buddhists doesn't have CNIC cards and the actual Buddhist population could exceed 16,000.https://www.thefridaytimes.com/meeting-pakistans-buddhists/ In Punjab, Buddhists live primarily in the outskirts of Mandi Yazman and Rahimyar Khan of Rohi region. Today they have around 15 colonies in various villages of Mandi Yazman. A statue of Buddha (at Jaulian, Taxila) with a hole in the navel is an odd artifact. It is called the \\"Healing Buddha\\". Buddhist pilgrims put their fings in the navel hole and pray for the ailment of the patients. ==Buddhism in modern Pakistan== Tridev Roy, the Chakma chief, supported Pakistan during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War left the Chittagong region and settled in Pakistan. He claimed to represent the Buddhists of Pakistan by founding and chairing the \\"Pakistan Buddhist Society\\" from 1996 until his death in 2012. Monks to start peace march tomorrow,August 05, 2002 His family stayed behind in Bangladesh. Lala Rajoo Raam is the representative of the Baori Buddhists community. He is also a councillor for Chak number 75 DB, Union Council number 88. He also twice contested elections for the Punjab assembly. ==Islam and Hinduism== Gandhara remained a largely Buddhist land until around 10th century CE, when Sultan Mahmud conquered the region and introduced Islam. There was settlement of Muslims and the emigration of Buddhists.Ousel, M. (1997). Ancient india and indian civilization. Routledge. Thul Mir Rukan stupa near Dadu, Sindh Buddhism was practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayyad Caliphate in 710 CE. These regions became predominantly Muslim during the rule of Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire due to the missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs (shrines) dot the landscape of Pakistan and the rest of South Asia. ==Taliban destruction of Buddhist relics== Gumbatona stupa, Swat, KPK, a rare example true domed stupa 1st or 2nd century AD The Swat Valley in Pakistan has many Buddhist carvings and stupas, and Jehanabad contains a Seated Buddha statue. Kushan era Buddhist stupas and statues in Swat valley were demolished by the foreign funded Taliban and after two attempts by the foreign funded Taliban, the Jehanabad Buddha's face was dynamited. Only the Bamiyan Buddhas were larger than the carved giant Buddha statue in Swat near Mangalore which the Taliban attacked. The government did nothing to safeguard the statue after the initial attempt at destroying it, which did not cause permanent harm, but when the second attack took place on the statue the feet, shoulders, and face were demolished. Islamists such as the Taliban and looters destroyed much of Pakistan's Buddhist artifacts left over from the Buddhist Gandhara civilization, especially in Swat Valley. The Taliban deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction. The Christian Archbishop of Lahore Lawrence John Saldanha wrote a letter to Pakistan's government denouncing the Taliban activities in Swat Valley including their destruction of Buddha statues and their attacks on Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus. Gandhara Buddhist artifacts were also looted by smugglers. A group of Italians helped repair the Buddha at Jahan Abad, Swat. == Pakistan Buddhist tourism == In March 2013, a group of around 20 Buddhist monks from South Korea made the journey to the monastery of Takht-e-Bahi, 170 kilometres (106 miles) from Islamabad. The monks defied appeals from Seoul to abandon their trip for safety reasons and were guarded by Pakistani security forces on their visit to the monastery, built of ochre- coloured stone and nestled on a mountainside. From around 1,000 years BC until the seventh century AD, northern Pakistan and parts of modern Afghanistan formed the Gandhara kingdom, where Greek and Buddhist customs mixed to create what became the Mahayana strand of the religion. The monk Marananta set out from what is now northwest Pakistan to cross China and spread Buddhism on the Korean peninsula during the fourth century. The authorities are even planning package tours for visitors from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, including trips to the Buddhist sites at Takht-e-Bahi, Swat, Peshawar and Taxila, near Islamabad. === Takht-i-Bahi === Takht-i-Bahi Takht means “throne” and bahi, “water” or “spring” in Persian/Urdu. The monastic complex was called Takht-i-Bahi because it was built atop a hill and also adjacent to a stream. Located 80 kilometers from Peshawar and 16 kilometers Northwest of the city of Mardan, Takht-I-Bahi was unearthed in early 20th century and in 1980 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list as the largest Buddhist remains in Gandhara, along with the Sahr-i-Bahlol urban remains that date back to the same period, located about a kilometer south. === Taxila === DharmaRajika Stupa-Taxila The modern town of Taxila is 35 km from Islamabad. Most of the archaeological sites of Taxila (600 BC to 500 AD) are located around Taxila Museum. For over one thousand years, Taxila remained famous as a centre of learning Gandhara art of sculpture, architecture, education and Buddhism in the days of Buddhist glory. There are over 50 archaeological sites scattered in a radius of 30 km around Taxila. Some of the most important sites are: Dhamarajika Stupa and Monastery (300 BC - 200 AD), Bhir Mound (600-200 BC), Sirkap (200 BC - 600 AD), Jandial Temple (c.250 BC) and Jaulian Monastery (200 - 600 AD). A museum comprising various sections with rich archaeological finds of Taxila, arranged in chronological order and properly labeled, has been established close to the site. === Mingora === Votive Stupas - Butkara-III Mingora Mingora, 3 km away from Saidu Sharif, has yielded magnificent pieces of Buddhist sculpture and the ruins of a great stupa. Shingardar Stupa is one of the famous located near Bariko Other stupas like Amaan Kot and Jehan-a-Abad are too a great asset. === Swat === Shingardar Stupa The Lush-green valley of Swat District--with its rushing torrents, icy-cold lakes, fruit-laden orchards and flower-decked slopes--is ideal for holiday-makers intent on relaxation. It also has a rich historical past: \\"Udayana\\" (the \\"Garden\\") of the ancient Hindu epics; \\"the land of enthralling beauty\\", where Alexander of Macedonia fought and won some of his major battles before crossing over to the plains of Pakistan, and \\"the valley of the hanging chains\\" described by the famous Chinese pilgrim-chroniclers, Faxian and Xuanzang in the fifth and seventh centuries. Swat was once a cradle for major strands of Buddhism, where 1,400 monasteries flourished: Little Vehicle, Great Vehicle and the Esoteric sects. It was the home of the famous Gandhara School of Sculpture which was an expression of Graeco-Roman form in the local Buddhist tradition. Amlukdara stupa However, the ruins of great Buddhist stupas, monasteries and statues are found all over Swat. == Buddhist scholars from Pakistan == list of Buddhist scholars who hailed from present-day regions of Pakistan * Asanga from Peshawar, 4th-century C.E. * Vasubandhu from Peshawar, 4th to 5th century CE * Lokaksema from Gandhara, 147 CE * Dharmarakṣa (265–313) * Prajñā (c. 810) * Maranatha c. 384 (introduced Buddhism in Korea) *Tridev Roy, Pakistani Buddhist politician and leader ==See also== *History of Buddhism *Hindu and Buddhist architectural heritage of Pakistan *History of Pakistan *Index: Buddhism by country ==References== ==External links== * Archaeology in Gandhara region —Buddhist sites Pakistan Category:History of religion in Pakistan Category:History of Pakistan Category:Religion in Pakistan ","title":"Buddhism in Pakistan"},{"id":"9088723","text":"Arthur E. Pallan (May 11, 1923--January 22, 2007) was an American radio celebrity in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Born in Braddock, PA, he graduated from Brentwood High School. He landed his first radio job at WWSW. Upon graduating from high school, Pallan took an office job with Procter & Gamble. But he dreamed of being in radio and would spend his lunch hours watching the announcers working at KDKA and WWSW. He auditioned several times at WWSW and was finally hired when the station had a shortage of announcers because of World War II. He served in the military himself and was a decorated veteran. Pallan moved over to KDKA in 1956 where his popularity would grow in the Pittsburgh market during the 1960s. Like Cordic, Pallan was mentored by Bill Cullen, who was on staff at WWSW before he left for New York and found national fame as a game show personality. Pallan spent much of his time at KDKA assigned to the midday slot. He featured a cheerful, upbeat style and referred to himself as \\"Your Pal Pallan\\", and often appeared on television promotional announcements for KDKA in his trademark white goatee and brightly colored Hawaiian print or bowling shirts. Pallan was the first disc jockey to play The Skyliners' \\"Since I Don't Have You,\\" airing the record on Dec. 26, 1958 at precisely 10:20 a.m., the time designed to coincide with KDKA's 1020 position on the AM dial. Pallan was also close to singer Bobby Vinton and regularly featured Vinton's music on his show. When Rege Cordic left KDKA for Los Angeles in 1965, Pallan and former Cordic sidekick Bob Trow were given the morning show. \\"Pallan and Trow, Two For The Show\\" debuted on Nov. 29, 1965 and ran through April 1968. At that time KDKA changed the direction of the morning show by hiring Jack Bogut from Salt Lake City. Pallan then returned to the familiar midday slot, where he spent the rest of his KDKA career. He retired in February 1985, and Doug Hawkes took over the time slot. Pallan said his favorite broadcasts were the Christmas season shows that KDKA originated daily from the downtown department store windows as a fund-raiser for Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital. Pallan was also a singer who cut several records in the 1950s. In 2014 on his 7th year death anniversary, his recording of the song \\"Land of Dreams\\" was published onto Youtube. He had a style that was similar to that of Bing Crosby. He had a gift for dialects and was an exceptional joke teller. Pallan and his wife Agnes had three daughters and a son. ==References== *http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment- living/get-rhythm/item/39759-kdka-legend-art-pallan-sings-and-very-well *John Hayes (2007).

After Solare Nederland went bankrupt in 2014, the Belgian branches were bought back by the De Slegte family and change to their original names. Four branches in Belgium continue to operate, three branches in the Netherlands were added. == History  Until 2013: De Slegte === De Slegte was founded early 20th century by Jan De Slegte, a lamplighter in Rotterdam who bought and sold books as a side business. When his profession became obsolete, selling books became his main focus. His son joined and sold books on the street market. Throughout the 20th century, the business expanded and grew into a prominent book chain in the Netherlands and Flanders. === 1992–2013: BGN and Selexyz === Boekhandels Groep Nederland was one of the larger chains of bookstores in the Netherlands, running 16 branches in Dutch cities, including historic bookstores such as Donner in Rotterdam, one of Europe's largest bookstores; and the Domicanen in Maastricht, located in a 13th-century Dominican church building and cited as an outstanding example of adaptive reuse.Anja Sieg, \\"Dutch book chain Selexyz files for bankruptcy\\", The Bookseller, March 29, 2012.Sean Dodson, \\"Top shelves\\", The Guardian, January 11, 2008.\\"Selexyz Dominicanen opens in Maastricht\\", Crossroads Magazine, November 20, 2006. Originally, BGN bookstores carried their own name, in combination with the old BGN-logo. In 2006 every store was rebranded to carry the Selexyz brand name followed by its individual name, for example, Selexyz Scheltema. In April 2012, Selexyz's holding company filed for bankruptcy and sold the chain to Dutch investment company ProCures for €3.5 million. Initially the stores continued at Selexyz. === 2013-2014: Polare === The Selexyz operations were combined with those of the 26-store second-hand book store chain De Slegte into a new company, owned 60% by ProCures and 40% by the De Slegte family.Anja Sieg, \\"ProCures buys Selexyz bookshops\\", The Bookseller, April 10, 2012.

Extensive talks with several large banks and the CB, formerly called Centraal Boekhuis, resulted in green light from some of the banks; but the CB (supplying every single Dutch bookstore) already had come into conflict with Polare about overdue payments in late January, and they effectively blocked the salvation-effort of the Polare chain. ===Since 2014: De Slegte is back=== Some of the Dutch stores restarted under previous names at old or new locations. The Belgian branches of Polare continued as De Slegte. In 2020 there are 4 De Slegte bookstores in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent, Leuven, and Mechelen) and 3 stores in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Leiden, and Rotterdam). ==See also== * Books in the Netherlands ==References== ==External links== *De Slegte Category:Retail companies of the Netherlands Category:Bookstores in the Netherlands Category:Retail companies of Belgium Category:Store brands ","title":"De Slegte"},{"id":"9088776","text":"Saint Landelin (Landelinus) (c.625-686,Lobbes (Municipality, Province of Hainaut, Belgium) Belgium) was a former brigand who underwent a Christian conversion.

It is situated at the Oude Turfmarkt 127 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Artifacts from the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt, the Near East, the Greek World, Etruria, and the Roman Empire are curated and exhibited in this museum. ==Allard Pierson== The name of the Allard Pierson Museum derives from the first professor of classical archaeology at the University of Amsterdam, Allard Pierson (1831–1896). This former clergyman was invited in 1877 to occupy the chair of Aesthetics, Art History, and Modern Languages at the newly founded university. His passion for antiquity, fuelled by his travels to the Mediterranean area, led to his assembling a collection of plaster casts from 1877 to 1895. ==Founding== The second professor of archeology at the University of Amsterdam, Jan Six, had a large personal collection of books and antique objects. At his death in 1926, the university had an interest in acquiring his collection. In 1932, Pierson's son Jan Lodewijk established the Allard Pierson Foundation in order to make the antiquities collection available for research and teaching. The collection was brought to a building on the Weesperzijde in Amsterdam, with the top floor serving as a museum. The collection grew due to purchases, gifts, and loans of artifacts and documents. On 12 November 1934, the Allard Pierson Museum was officially opened in a building at Sarphatistraat 129-131 (corner of the Roeterstraat). The museum eventually outgrew its building. ==Building== A new building became available when the Nederlandse Bank vacated their office at the Oude Turfmarkt in 1976. H.R.H. Princess Beatrix attended the re-opening of the museum on 6 October 1976. ==Collection== The museum has collections related to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Near East, the Greek World, Etruria, and the Roman Empire. The collections include art objects and utensils dating from 4000 BC to 500 AD. There are also scale models of ancient temples and buildings. In the Ancient Egypt exhibition there is a room dedicated to death, with mummies, sarcophagi, and a film showing the process of mummification. The plaster-cast attic, to be visited only with a guided tour, shows copies of Roman and Greek statues. The museum's Greek pottery collection features examples of black-figure and red-figure pottery produced in the fifth and sixth centuries BC. A collection of Roman sarcophagi is also on display, including a rare wooden coffin from around 150 AD that is carved partly in the shape of the man within it.

The album was released in the United States by Hypnotic Records in 1998, after having been unavailable in the country, and was later re-released through System 7 member Steve Hillage's A-Wave label in 2003. After establishing themselves as ambient house producers in the early 1990s, System 7 recorded 777 at Butterfly Studios in September 1992, sharing the album's name with the 1992 American version of their first studio album, System 7. Compared to the group's ambient-styled debut album, 777 has a stronger emphasis on dance music, incorporating styles of techno and trance. The record also features collaborations with The Orb and producer Youth. Released at the height of the popularity of ambient music in the UK, 777 peaked at number 30 on the UK Albums Chart, and received critical acclaim. ==Production and composition== In the 1990s, musician Steve Hillage and his former Gong bandmate Miquette Giraudy formed System 7, an ambient house group who operated more as a recording collective than a band. The formation of the group was inspired by Hillage befriending Alex Paterson of the Orb, who played Hillage's Rainbow Dome Musick (1979) at the Heaven nightclub in London while Hillage was there. Paterson persuaded Hillage to record ambient house music with his guitar as prominent in the mix as it had been in his solo work. System 7's debut single \\"Sunburst\\" was released in late 1990, followed by debut album System 7 (1991) which featured collaborations with acts like Derrick May. The group then signed to Astralwerks in the United States who released System 7 there in 1992 with the new name 777. Youth (pictured here with Killing Joke) provided co-production and mixing on \\"7:7 Expansion\\". After releasing the standalone singles \\"Freedom Fighters\\" and \\"Attitude,\\" System 7 began preparing for their second album. They named it 777, sharing its name with the 1992 American release of their debut album. The group had been briefly known as 777 when a rock band named System Seven complained, but System 7 reverted to their original name after System Seven dissolved. System 7 recorded 777 at Butterfly Studios in September 1992, with recording assistance from Jody Sherry, Neal Snyman and Scruff. \\"7:7 Expansion\\" features additional co-producing and mixing from Youth, and is the only track on the album not to feature Giraudy. The Orb feature on \\"A Cool Dry Place\\", with Alex Paterson providing \\"ambience & navigation\\" and Kris Weston featuring on keyboards alongside Giraudy. The Orb also co-produced and mixed the track. Unlike the ambient pop of System 7's early work, 777 moves the group towards straightforward techno, contributing to what biographer John Bush felt was \\"a completely different work than the earlier LP.\\" The album places an stronger emphasis on dance music than its predecessor, with \\"its feet firmly on the dancefloor\\" according to writer Ben Hogwood. Candy Absorption of Rough Guides wrote that, compared to System 7's debut album, 777 saw the group's \\"blissed- out trance textures and rhythms take over.\\" Ben Hogwood of Resident Advisor cites \\"Sinbad\\" as proof that \\"Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy know how to make a crowd dance.\\" \\"Quest\\" and \\"7:7 Expansion\\" also feature \\"solidly rocking grooves.\\" \\"A Cool Dry Place\\" features a soundscape style. ==Release and reception== 777 was released in the United Kingdom by Big Life Records in March 1993. It reached number 30 on the UK Albums Chart, spending two weeks on the chart in total, and it remains their most successful album on the chart. Absorption felt the album's British Top 40 success was because it was released at the peak of \\"ambient fervour\\" in the region. The artwork for 777 features photography from Trevor Key with design and art direction from David James Associates. Key's photograph for the cover depicts an early, primitive version of the typeface Metsys used for the band's name; the type and effects are part of the original photograph and were not added to the image in post-production. The liner notes and back cover use Gerstner Original, a typeface with a \\"fluid, techy and sci-fi quality\\" similar to Metsys. \\"7:7 Expansion\\" was released as the album's first single in February 1993, and it reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's first and highest charting single. A double A-side of \\"Sinbad\\" and \\"Quest\\" was issued as the album's second and final single in June, and it reached number 74 on the chart. Although System 7 wanted to release 777 in the United States, the record went unreleased the country until Cleopatra Records and Hypnotic Records re- released the album there in 1998. After Hillage acquired the rights to 777 and other System 7 albums, he re-released 777 on his label A-Wave on 26 May 2003. In a contemporary review, Rupert Howe of Select described 777 as taking the \\"directionless jumble\\" of the group's debut and \\"[hammering] some kind of form out of Hillage's druidic fantasies.\\" He wrote that the collaborations with The Orb and Youth were the album highlights, both offering what he described as a \\"rhythmic toughness that drops out of the later trips through the Hillage fretboard repertory.\\" Andrew Boyd of the Reading Evening Post expressed disappointment that the group \\"abandoned the vocals which enlivened many of the best tracks on their debut album,\\" instead making an album of \\"Orb-like meanderings\\" that are \\"very pleasant, but no more than that.\\" While Dave Simpson of Melody Maker described 777 as sounding like the Orb, whom he said Hillage \\"virtually invented\\" with his album Rainbow Dome Musick (1979), he conceded it was a \\"fine LP\\" which he hoped would achieve commercial success. John Bush of AllMusic highlighted \\"7:7 Expansion\\" and \\"Sinbad\\" as among the best tracks on 777 in a retrospective review. In a review of the 2003 reissue, Ben Hogwood of Resident Advisor wrote that 777 had \\"stood up well\\" as a result of its emphasis on dance music, and felt that \\"Sinbad\\" alone was proof that the System 7 reissues held \\"value.\\" He also wrote that the reissues of 777 and other albums by the group would remind listeners \\"of the surprising weight and influence that System 7 hold within dance music.\\" == Track listing == \\"Quest (Moon Mix)\\" was not included on the early versions of the album. == Personnel == Credits adapted from liner notes. * Steve Hillage – production, guitar, keyboards, programming * Miquette Giraudy – production, keyboards, programming * Youth – production, keyboards * Tony Thorpe – production, keyboards * The Orb – production * Lewis Keogh – production, keyboards * Matt Austin – programming * Kris Weston – keyboards * Alex Paterson – ambience, navigation == Charts == { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" !scope=\\"col\\" Chart !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" UK Albums (OCC)  30 - } == References == == External links == * * 777 at A-Wave Category:1993 albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Hillage Category:System 7 (band) albums ","title":"777 (System 7 album)"},{"id":"9088871","text":"Clement Rodney Hampton-El, also known as Dr. Rashid, had been a member of the Moorish Science Temple of America and was convicted in the New York City landmark bomb plot.

It stars Aaliyah in the title role as the vampire queen Akasha and Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat. This was Aaliyah's final film completed before her death on August 25, 2001. The film was released on February 22, 2002, in the United States and on April 4, 2002, in Australia. It received generally negative reviews from critics but was a moderate box office success. ==Plot== The vampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a hard rock band, and proceeds to take over as their lead singer. Achieving international success, Lestat, having revealed the existence of vampires, taunts the others of his kind during an interview for promoting his first and only live concert. Jesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics after hearing one of his songs play on TV and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know what he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. David also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and gives it to Jesse for her to read. In the journal, Lestat recalls how he was turned into a vampire by Marius and how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Unsatisfied with what she read, Jesse tracks Lestat down to a London vampire club called The Admiral's Arms, where he saves her from three vampires and confronts her about Marius. In Los Angeles, Lestat is visited by Marius, who warns him that the other vampires will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile. Marius also reveals that Akasha has awakened due to Lestat's new music and begs him to cancel his concert, which he refuses. Meanwhile, Akasha, who is searching for Lestat, arrives at The Admiral's Arms. After the vampires reveal their plan to kill Lestat at his concert, Akasha torches the club and kills all the vampires inside. Jesse arrives at Los Angeles and gives Lestat his journal back. She then asks him to show her what being a vampire is like. Lestat scoffs at the idea, but Jesse convinces him to spend his last moments before the concert with her. The two spend some time together and Jesse later asks Lestat to turn her, telling him she wants to be with him and that she wants to know everything he does. Lestat angrily refuses, showing her what it's like for a vampire to feed on a human, then leaves. While performing at his concert in Death Valley, a group of vampires attack Lestat. With Marius' help, they both fend off most of the vampires until Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her. Akasha brings Lestat to her new home, where the two vampires mutually feed on one another, during which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her, and Akasha proclaims Lestat her new king. After the concert, Jesse is taken to the home of her aunt, Maharet, who later reveals herself to be one of the Ancient Vampires. Knowing Akasha's plan to take over the world, the Ancient Vampires discuss their plans to destroy the Queen by drinking from her and draining her of her blood. However, they believe that whoever drinks the Queen's last drop will not survive. Empowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires. When they refuse to join her, Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse, as The Queen sees her both as an enemy, due to being Maharet's descendant, and as food, with Akasha making an example out of her for those who dare disobey her command. Lestat ostensibly obeys, but after drinking Jesse's blood, comes to his senses and is released from Akasha's power. He angrily requests for his \\"crown\\" and Akasha openly gives him her arm to feed on. Lestat then turns on her and begins to drain Akasha's blood. With the help of the Ancients, Akasha's power diminishes. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, killing Akasha. Lestat goes to Jesse and, cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood as Maharet turns into a marble statue and \\"sleeps\\", becoming the new Queen of the Damned. Lestat and Jesse, who is now a vampire, visit David and return Lestat's journal. When asked by David what it is like, Jesse jokingly offers to turn him into a vampire to which he replies he's too old for immortality. Jesse then bids David goodbye and leaves with Lestat. A few moments later, David is greeted by Marius. The film closes with Lestat and Jesse walking hand in hand, among mortals, into the night. ==Cast== * Aaliyah as Akasha * Stuart Townsend as Lestat de Lioncourt * Marguerite Moreau as Jesse Reeves ** Richael Tanner as young Jesse * Vincent Perez as Marius de Romanus * Paul McGann as David Talbot * Lena Olin as Maharet * Christian Manon as Mael * Claudia Black as Pandora * Bruce Spence as Khayman * Matthew Newton as Armand * Tiriel Mora as Roger * Megan Dorman as Maudy * Johnathan Devoy as James * Pia Miranda as Roommate ==Development== Warner Bros. had acquired the film rights to several of Anne Rice's novels—the first three Vampire Chronicles and The Mayfair Witches trilogyAnne Rice answers Salon readers' questions , Salon.com, August 23, 1996.—after a 1988 takeover of Lorimar Productions. An eventual adaptation of Interview with the Vampire (directed by Neil Jordan and produced by David Geffen) was released in 1994, although not without controversy, particularly over fan reaction to the casting of Tom Cruise as Lestat, an objection initially shared by Anne Rice, which she recanted after seeing the finished film. After the commercial and critical success of Interview, Neil Jordan began initial development of the novel's sequel, The Vampire Lestat, although this went nowhere. As the rights to the novels would revert to Anne Rice at the end of 2000, initial story meetings to adapt one or both of the remaining Vampire Chronicles began in 1998. The decision was made early to substantially rewrite the plot, and to base most of the movie on the third book: The Vampire Lestat was considered too broad and episodic for a two-hour feature film, although the novel's setup of Lestat's awakening and career as a rock star was used. It was also decided to focus on Lestat as the primary character, and the back story of Akasha and the Story of the Twins were omitted, despite these being virtually central to the plot of the novel.Debra Campbell: A chat with the producer , queenofthedamned.co.uk Displeased with the lack of progress, and more particularly with the studio's lack of consultation with her over the script development, author Anne Rice wrote a critical reply to a fan's question about the film in 1998:Coming Attractions: Queen of the Damned, Corona Productions. During 1999, the script was developed by TV screenwriter Scott Abbott and Australian writer/director Michael Petroni. Another Australian, Michael Rymer, was confirmed to direct. Rymer suggested the film be shot in his home city of Melbourne, which would save considerably on production costs. The first actor cast was R&B; singer Aaliyah (who had made her film and acting debut in Romeo Must Die) as Akasha, the eponymous Queen of the Damned. The search for an actor to play Lestat took much longer—the idea of Tom Cruise reprising the role was considered but dismissed—although front runners included Wes Bentley, Josh Hartnett and Heath Ledger. Irish actor Stuart Townsend assumed the role in 2000, and the final cast included Vincent Perez as Marius, Paul McGann as David Talbot, Lena Olin as Maharet and Marguerite Moreau as Jesse Reeves. Australian actors included Claudia Black as Pandora and Matthew Newton as Armand. ==Production== With a large cast of international and Australian actors, Queen of the Damned began principal photography on October 2, 2000 and ended on February 27, 2001, in a former biscuit factory, converted into a studio in the Melbourne suburb of St. Albans. Location filming took place around the city of Melbourne, although some filming was done in Los Angeles. For the scenes of Lestat's concert in Death Valley, over 3000 goths were recruited from Melbourne nightclubs and on the Internet, then driven on a fleet of buses to a quarry in Werribee to act as extras. ==Soundtracks== The songs for Lestat's band were written and performed by Jonathan Davis of the nu metal band Korn, and Richard Gibbs, although Davis's contractual commitments to Sony BMG meant that his vocals could not appear on the soundtrack album. Instead, the vocals were re-recorded by other musicians for the soundtrack's official release: Wayne Static of Static-X (\\"Not Meant for Me\\"), David Draiman of Disturbed (\\"Forsaken\\"), Chester Bennington of Linkin Park (\\"System\\"), Marilyn Manson (\\"Redeemer\\"), and Jay Gordon of Orgy (\\"Slept So Long\\"). During the end credits \\"Not Meant for Me\\" is played. It is Jonathan Davis' version although the credits list it as the Wayne Static version from the album. Davis also made a small cameo in the film. When Jesse arrives in Los Angeles, a scalper (Jonathan Davis) attempts to sell her tickets to Lestat's show. The soundtrack also contains other songs featured in the film: \\"Body Crumbles\\" by Dry Cell, \\"Cold\\" by Static-X, \\"Dead Cell\\" by Papa Roach, \\"Excess\\" by Tricky, \\"Headstrong\\" by Earshot, \\"Penetrate\\" by Godhead, \\"Down with the Sickness\\" by Disturbed, \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" by Deftones and \\"Before I'm Dead\\" by Kidneythieves. The score for the film was also composed by Gibbs and Davis. Both the main soundtrack album and score album were released in 2002. Frank Fitzpatrick and Rich Dickerson were the Music Supervisors for the film and the soundtrack album. The original studio recording of \\"Careless (Akasha's Lament)\\" was written and produced by Davis and Gibbs, during the Queen of the Damned sessions. Vocals were by Davis, keyboards by Gibbs, guitars by James Shaffer, Brian Welch, and Davis, and drums by Vinnie Colaiuta. Davis released the song in downloadable form via Amazon and iTunes on November 16, 2007.https://music.apple.com/gb/album/careless-single/269650226 Plans to record a duet between Aaliyah and Davis never materialised, due to Aaliyah's death. ==ReleaseAuthor's reaction=== By July 2001, author Anne Rice had mellowed her previous stance on the film, much as she had with Interview. When asked about the film's progress, she answered:Complete Message Archive , AnneRice.com. > Everything I hear about the movie is good. Warner Bros. is extremely > enthusiastic. They are working very hard to make it perfect. I have no real > news. Let me repeat what I mentioned in a recent message. I met Stuart > Townsend, the young man who is playing Lestat and he was absolutely > charming. He had Lestat's excellent speaking voice and his feline grace. I > cannot wait to see him in the film. By late 2001, Rice had seen the completed film and was sufficiently satisfied to allow her name to be used on promotional material,Saralegui, Jorge: On Anne Rice's Involvement with the Project , QueenoftheDamned.com, 2001. although she later became disillusioned about it and dismissed the film in 2003, stating that a television series format would be more suited to the source material.Interview with Anne Rice , The Art of the Word, October 2, 2003. Subsequently, Rice urged fans on her Facebook page to \\"simply forget\\" about the film, which she said \\"mutilated\\" her work. ===Public and critical reaction=== Queen of the Damned was released on February 22, 2002 in the United States and Canada. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, with several reviewers such as Roger Ebert describing it as \\"goofy\\" or \\"damned\\". The film has an approval \\"rotten\\" rating of 17% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 130 reviews, with the site's consensus calling the film \\"A muddled and campy MTV-styled vampire movie with lots of eye candy and bad accents.\\" Despite negative reviews, Queen of the Damned nonetheless topped the box office on its opening weekend, against fairly weak competition.Aaliyah's parents sue over plane crash, BBC News, 14 May 2002.All that glitters is not gold, The Age, March 11, 2002.Film of the Damned - the Tragedy Behind \\"Queen of the Damned\\", BBC Online. The film grossed $45.5 million on a $35 million budget. ===Allan Menzies=== In December 2002, Allan Menzies from West Lothian, Scotland, murdered one of his friends. He claimed in court that it was Aaliyah's character Queen Akasha from the film that told him to do it. ==References* * * Category:2002 fantasy films Category:2002 films Category:2002 horror films Category:American fantasy films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Australian fantasy films Category:Australian films Category:Australian supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Film adaptations disliked by their authors Category:Films based on American horror novels Category:Films based on multiple works of a series Category:Films based on works by Anne Rice Category:Films directed by Michael Rymer Category:Films scored by Richard Gibbs Category:Films shot in Melbourne Category:Horror films featuring female antagonists Category:Vampires in film Category:Village Roadshow Pictures films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Works based on The Vampire Chronicles ","title":"Queen of the Damned"},{"id":"9088893","text":"Walter Alberto López Gasco (born 15 October 1985) is a Uruguayan footballer who currently plays for Italian club Salernitana in defence or midfield. ==Career== Born in Montevideo, López began his career at hometown club Racing Club and spent time in Argentina with San Martín de Tucumán, before moving to Uruguayan Primera División side River Plate Montevideo in 2005. While registered to the club, he spent time on loan in Spain, with Xerez, and in Mexico, with Tecos. He signed for West Ham United on 5 September 2008. On joining West Ham he was described by caretaker manager Kevin Keen as \\"a very attacking full-back who can get forward. Like David Di Michele, he is another West Ham-type player who will hopefully show everyone at the club what he can do\\". Michele had been signed by the club on loan around the same time. López made his debut for West Ham United in a League Cup third round tie, playing the full game in an away defeat at Watford on 23 September 2008. He made his Premier League debut as a late substitute in West Ham's 1–0 win over Manchester City on 1 March 2009. López failed to cement a place in the first team due to the presence of Congolese international Hérita Ilunga and, having made five substitute Premier League appearances, was subsequently released by West Ham at the end of the 2008–09 season. He returned to Uruguay and signed for Primera División side Cerro. He was then loaned to Brescia of Italy's Serie B. He managed one goal for the Italians, his first outside of South America, in 29 appearances. In the summer of 2010, López was loaned to Romanian Liga 1 side FC Universitatea Craiova. After a six-month loan, at the start of 2011, the club decided to buy the player and López signed a contract for three years. In July 2011, López moved back to Uruguay and joined Peñarol. While signed to the club, he spent time on loan at Paraguayan club Cerro Porteño in 2012. In March 2013, he was arrested and sentenced to 90 days of community service for \\"crime simulation\\", after setting fire to his truck and reporting it stolen in order to claim insurance money. López left Peñarol in September 2013, moving back to Italy to join Serie C club Lecce. After two seasons, he moved once again to Paraguay and joined Sol de América.

It was amongst the first jet-propelled aircraft to be developed and was produced on an experimental basis. Following favourable testing of Britain's first jet propelled aircraft, the turbojet-powered Gloster E.28/39 in 1941, there was considerable interest in the application of the new propulsion technology to fighter aircraft. During 1942, work commenced upon a development of a larger twin-engined fighter aircraft, which became the Gloster Meteor, the first Allied jet fighter. British industrial manufacturer Rover, who had already been contracted to produce the Power Jets W.2 jet engine, had considerable difficulty in achieving sufficient engine production during the war. Concerned by the wider production consequences of this shortage, the Air Ministry recognised the potential value of adopting a single-engined aircraft over the twin-engine configuration of the Meteor, leading to the issuing of Specification E.5/42, calling for the design and manufacture of such a fighter. Gloster was amongst those companies to receive the specification and produced a single-engine fighter design with a low-wing monoplane configuration, which was to be equipped with a highly tapered wing and a T-tail, as well as being alternatively powered by either a single Halford H.1 or Rolls-Royce Nene engine, fed by air intakes in the wing roots. During late 1943, work on a pair of prototypes, as the GA.1, commenced. Engine manufacturing problems were mostly rectified following the reassignment of production activity to Rolls-Royce Limited. Gloster decided to refine the GA.1 independently, until the Air Ministry issued Specification E.1/44 during 1944, which sought an experimental jet-powered aircraft powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene, leading to the revised GA.2. Progress on the new fighter was slow, Gloster having concentrated on the development and production of the Meteor. On 9 March 1948, the second E.1/44 performed its maiden flight at RAF Boscombe Down. Testing revealed unpromising performance and characteristics and Gloster recognised the Meteor as having more development potential and the aircraft never entered production. ==DevelopmentBackground=== The development of the turbojet-powered E.1/44 was the product of a collaboration between the Gloster Aircraft Company and Sir Frank Whittle's firm, Power Jets Ltd. Whittle had formed Power Jets in March 1936 to develop his ideas of jet propulsion, with Whittle as the company's chief engineer.Pavelec 2007, pp. 45–46. For several years, attracting financial backers and aviation firms prepared to take on Whittle's radical ideas was difficult; in 1931, Armstrong-Siddeley had evaluated and rejected Whittle's proposal, finding it to be technically sound but at the limits of engineering capability.Pavelec 2007, pp. 43–44. Securing funding was a persistently worrying issue throughout the early development of the engine.Golley and Gunston 2010, pp. 92–94. The first Whittle prototype jet engine, the Power Jets WU, began running trials in early 1937; shortly afterwards, Sir Henry Tizard, chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee and the Air Ministry gave the project their support.Pavelec 2007, pp. 48–50. On 28 April 1939, Whittle made a visit to the premises of the Gloster Aircraft Company, where he met several key figures, such as George Carter, Gloster's chief designer.Golley and Gunston 2010, p. 139. Carter took a keen interest in Whittle's project, particularly when he saw the operational Power Jets W.1 engine; Carter quickly made several rough proposals of various aircraft designs powered by the engine. Independently, Whittle had also been producing proposals for a high-altitude jet-powered bomber; following the start of the Second World War and the Battle for France, a greater national emphasis on fighter aircraft arose.Golley and Gunston 2010, pp. 156, 165. Power Jets and Gloster quickly formed a mutual understanding around mid-1939.Golley and Gunston 2010, p. 127. In September 1939, the Air Ministry issued a specification to Gloster for an aircraft to test one of Whittle's turbojet designs in flight, resulting in the development of the Gloster E.28/39, the first British jet aircraft. The name adopted for this initial proof of concept aircraft, E.28/39, originated from the aircraft having been developed in conformance with the 28th \\"Experimental\\" specification issued by the Air Ministry in 1939.Flight International 13 May 1971, p. 677. While the specification had included provisions for armaments, these were not initially included and the aircraft was principally intended to demonstrate the viability, qualities, and potential value of jet propulsion in broad terms, not to immediately produce a combat aircraft.Grierson, John. Jet Flight. London: Sampson Low, Marston and Co. Ltd, 1946. On 15 May 1941, Gloster's Chief Test Pilot, Flight Lieutenant Gerry Sayer flew the aircraft under jet power for the first time from RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire, in a flight lasting 17 minutes.T.N.A. AIR62/42/198Flight International 13 May 1971, p. 678. ===Proposals=== The successful testing of the E.28/39 had directly led to the design of the twin-engined Gloster Meteor jet fighter from 1940. During 1942, engine manufacturer Rover, who had already been contracted to produce the Power Jets W.2 jet engine, had experienced production problems and the Air Ministry decided to issue Specification E.5/42 for an aircraft which would only be powered by one engine. Gloster produced a design which developed into a low-wing monoplane equipped with a highly tapered wing and a T-tail arrangement, along with a tailwheel undercarriage. It was to be powered by a Halford H.1 or Rolls-Royce Nene engine fed by intakes in the wing roots. During late 1943, construction activity on a pair of prototype GA.1s, commenced.Goulding 1986, p. 146.James 1971, pp. 306–307. The difficulties of manufacture were resolved by Rolls-Royce Limited exchanging jet engine production (as such, the W2 engine would become known as the Welland) for Meteor tank engine production with Rover, Rolls-Royce overcoming the production problems. Demand for a single-engined design dissipated and the fledgling GA.1 was no longer required. Gloster continued to work on the design privately, intending to adopt a Halford H.1 engine to power the type instead of the W2/Welland. During 1944, the Air Ministry issued Specification E.1/44 for an experimental jet-powered aircraft that would be powered the new Rolls- Royce Nene engine. Gloster's design team decided to approach the specified requirements of this new specification by developing a new design, GA.2. It was not based on the earlier E.5/42, being a significantly larger aeroplane.Goulding 1986, p.151. During 1944, after reviewing submissions, the Air Ministry issued a contract to Gloster for a prototype; this order was joined during late 1945 by additional orders for the completion of a further three aircraft.Mason 1992, pp. 356–357. ==Design== Gloster E.1/44 SM809, fitted with the original tail unit, circa 1944 The Gloster E.1/44 was a stressed-skin mid-winged monoplane design, featuring a relatively broad fuselage and a wide-track undercarriage. The design bore little resemblance to the twin-jet Meteor and only superficial similarities to the earlier pioneering E.28/29, being a larger and significantly heavier aircraft. Unlike the E.28/29, which had a central air intake in the nose into a straight- through duct to reach its turbojet engine, the E.1/44's Nene received air via a pair of semi-circular air intakes ahead of the wing roots.Flight 1948, pp. 429–430. The tailplane was mounted midway up the rear fuselage, set beneath the single fin and rudder. Unlike the earlier E5/42, a widely spaced tricycle landing gear arrangement was adopted for the E.1/44.Flight 1948, pp. 430, 432. The unusually wide fuselage of the E.1/44 was made in sections, the front of which being attached to the central section via four longerons. The centre fuselage, composed of reinforced Z-section frames and heavy double-channel section frames, accommodated the Nene and attachment points for the centre- section of the wing. Set into the sides of the central section were the air intakes, which featured boundary-layer bleeds and were readily detachable. The rear fuselage section used semi-monocoque construction, reinforced by several Z-section frames and top-hat stringers; the detachable tail section featured a similar structure. Apart from the upper portion of the fin, which was composed of wood for its insulating properties, the tail unit was an all-metal, stressed-skin unit. Rivets were used to attach the sections.Flight 1948, p. 430. Gloster E.1/44, equipped with the revised tail unit, circa 1949 The centre-section of the wing, which accommodated the flaps, inboard air brakes and main undercarriage, was a single-spar stressed-skin structure, with an auxiliary rear spar. Both spars use a plate web design; the main spar's booms were composed from high-tensile steel, the rear spar of light-alloy booms. The outer portions of the wing, which had similar construction, were fixed at the spars and at the leading edge. An unusual feature of the aircraft was the skin of the wings, which was composed of relatively difficult-to-work stainless- steel.Goulding 1986, pp. 151–152.James 1971, pp. 307–308. The flying controls of the E.1/44 were relatively conventional, employing an array of push-rods and spring-torque shafts (the latter being primarily used for actuation of the spring tabs) to feed control inputs to the flight control surfaces. Power for the undercarriage and the flaps was provided by a Dowty hydraulic pump, driven via a gear box from the Nene engine. For emergencies, there was a hand-pump for the flight surfaces and a compressed-air system for the undercarriage. Electrical power was provided by a 1,500-watt HX2 generator, also driven via the gear box, which charged a pair of series-connected 12-volt accumulators. Equipment included a two-way radio set, IFF, oxygen tanks, windscreen de-icing system, fire detectors and fire extinguishers and a drogue parachute in the tail.Flight 1948, p. 432. ==Construction and testing== Progress on the new fighter was slow, Gloster having chosen to concentrate on the twin-engined Meteor and the first prototype was not completed until July 1947. The project received a considerable setback when the prototype was destroyed in a road accident while being transported to RAF Boscombe Down for flight testing.Flight 1948, p. 429.Goulding 1986, p. 152. The first E.1/44 to fly was the second prototype. On 9 March 1948, it performed its maiden flight at RAF Boscombe Down, flown by Gloster Chief Test Pilot Bill Waterton. Reportedly, Waterton was not impressed with the aircraft, commenting on its lack of power and its unfavourable flying characteristics, unflatteringly referring to it as the \\"Gormless\\". While this unofficial name never stuck, the prototype never received an official name, although \\"Ace\\" was proposed at one point.Waterton 1956, p. 12. Shortly after its first flight, the second prototype was dispatched to RAF Moreton Valence, Gloucestershire for further test flights. Initial flight testing confirmed the aircraft's poor handling and a revised tail unit with a high mounted tailplane was installed. While this change has been credited with resolving the handling problems, performance remained little better than that of the existing Meteor. This comparison was a major factor in the termination of the test programme during 1949 as the design did not possess the development potential of the Meteor. The fourth prototype (TX150) was never completed.James 1971, pp. 309–310. Some elements of the design were used in other aircraft. The revised tail design developed for the E.1/44 was carried over to the Meteor, being employed on the Meteor F 8 and later models.Goulding 1986, p. 155. Following the end of the programme, the two aircraft to achieve flight continued in use as aerial test beds for some time before being scrapped; reportedly, at least one of these prototypes remained in existence as late as 1951.James 1971, p. 310. ==Variants== ;GA.1 :Single-engined version of the design to meet Air Ministry Specification E.5/42 – two aircraft serial numbers SM801 and SM805, construction abandoned. ;GA.2 Ace :Improved variant to meet E.1/44, three built, SM809 was destroyed during transit to Boscombe Down by road and never flew. TX145 was first to fly on 9 March 1948. TX148 with a modified tail first flew in 1949, the tail design was later used on the Gloster Meteor F.8. ;GA.3 :Pre-production aircraft, serial number TX150, not built. ;GA.4 :Forty early production aircraft were ordered in two batches in April and July 1946, cancelled and not built. ==Specifications (E.1/44)== ==See also== ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * Ashley, Glenn.

Within its range it is a very common and widespread species, especially in eastern North America. The common name \\"trout lily\\" refers to the appearance of its gray-green leaves mottled with brown or gray, which allegedly resemble the coloring of brook trout. The range is from Labrador south to Georgia, west to Mississippi, and north to Minnesota. ==Description Flowers === A yellow trout lily produces an erect flower stalk with a nodding, bisexual flower with 6 recurved, yellow, lanceolote tepals. The 20 to 33 mm long tepals are composed of 3 petals and 3 petal-like sepals. E. americanum does not flower for the first 4 to 7 years of its life. In any given colony, only 0.5% will have flowers. Trout lilies bloom in early spring before the trees growing above them develop leaves. Blooming at this time allows them unobstructed access to sunlight and time to grow when soil nutrient levels are high. The flowers close at night. === Leaves === Non-flowering plants grow a single leaf whereas flowering plants grow 2 basal leaves. The 8 to 23 centimeters long yellow trout lily leaves grow in the spring and range from elliptic to lanceolate leaves, the leaves may be mottled with gray to purple and have entire leaf margins. === Fruit and sexual reproduction === Erythronium americanum does not reproduce very effectively via sexual reproduction with only 10% of pollinated flowers developing seeds. The fruit is a 12 to 5 mm long capsule that is held off the ground by the flower stalk. E. americanum is a myrmecochorous plant, meaning that ants help disperse the seeds and reduce seed predation. To make the seeds more appealing to ants they have an elaiosome which is a structure that attracts ants. === Bulb and asexual reproduction === A trout lily grows from a 15 to 28 mm oval underground bulb. The bulb is often located in the upper 11 cm of soil although it may be as deep as 30 cm. The bulbs of E. americanum are buried very deeply compared to other lily family plants. The bulbs are mostly composed of storage tissue containing large amounts of energy rich starch. The bulb is covered by a papery husk which is the remains of the previous year's stalk. Trout lilies grow in colonies, some of which have been dated to be up to 300 years old. The individuals within a colony will often reproduce asexually via a \\"dropper\\" or from small bulbs budding off of the main bulb. A dropper is a tubular fleshy stem that grows out from a parent bulb, up toward the surface and then penetrates deep into the soil where another bulb is formed from the tip of the dropper. The stem connecting the daughter and parent bulb then dies. ==Subspecies== There are two subspecies, Erythronium americanum subsp. americanum and Erythronium americanum subsp. harperi. The americanum subspecies is a distributed more northerly and the harperi subspecies only occurs in the south, from Louisiana to Tennessee and Georgia. The subspecies differ in the shape of the capsule and stigma, with E. americanum subsp. americanum having a capsule with a rounded, truncate, or short-apiculate tip and erect stigma lobes without groves. E. americanum subsp. harperi has a distinctly apiculate capsule apex and stigma lobes which are both grooved and recurved. ==See also== * List of plants known as lily ==References== ==External links== * Canada Wildlife Federation: Wild about Flowers \\"Erythronium americanum -- Trout lily\\" * americanum Category:Ephemeral plants Category:Flora of Eastern North America Category:Plants described in 1808 Category:Garden plants of North America ","title":"Erythronium americanum"},{"id":"9088992","text":"Prunières is a commune in the Hautes Alpes department in southeastern France. ==Geography== It is close to Chorges which is the closest commerce town.

Children who are born to a Turkish mother or a Turkish father (in or out of marriage) are Turkish citizens from birth. The intention to renounce Turkish citizenship (or acquire citizenship from another state) is submitted in Turkey by a petition to the highest administrative official in the concerned person's place of residence, and when overseas to the Turkish consulate. Documents processed by these authorities are forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for appropriate action. ==Definition of citizenship== alt=cover of Turkish passport (maroon with gold letters) Citizenship is defined in Article 66 of the Turkish constitution: ==Adoption== A child adopted by a Turkish citizen automatically becomes a Turkish citizen if under 18 years old on the date the application for adoption was made. In some cases (although it is not required), those who have foreign names and are applying for Turkish citizenship change their name to a Turkish (but not necessarily a Muslim) name. Examples of people who have done this include football players Colin Kazim-Richards and Mehmet Aurélio.From Bury to Brazil, the rise of a boy called Colin Kazim-Richards Times Online. Retrieved on 2009-04-13. ==Loss of citizenship== There are three different states of loss of citizenship in Turkey. They are either, cancellation, revocation, or renunciation. *Loss of citizenship in Turkey may occur under Article 31 (Cancellation) where the national in question has misrepresented or concealed essential information in regards to his acquisition of Turkish nationality, Turkish nationality also may be revoked (Article 29) or renounced (Article 25), under the Turkish Citizenship Law (No: 12/6/2009 27256). ==The Blue Card as a form of \\"Citizenship lite\\"== Former Turkish citizens who were forced to give up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany or Austria) can apply for the Blue Card (Mavi Kart), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit. Excluded from this \\"Citizenship lite\\" is the right to vote. ==Naturalization== A foreign national may apply for naturalization if the following conditions are met: * Legal majority as defined by the laws of the applicant's country of origin or those of Turkey in the case of stateless persons, * Residence in Turkey for an uninterrupted period of five years prior to the application, * Intention to settle in Turkey and demonstration thereof, * No risk to public health, * Good moral character, * Adequate command of the Turkish language, * Sufficient income for his or her own livelihood and that of any dependants in Turkey, * No threat to national security or public order. Meeting these conditions does not give a foreign national an absolute right to Turkish citizenship. A foreign national who has been married to a Turkish citizen for three years and is still married to that partner may apply for naturalization under a different set of conditions: * Residence with the Turkish spouse (exceptions granted if the Turkish spouse dies after application is lodged), * Absence of acts jeopardising the marriage, * No threat to national security or public order. Following a successful application, the naturalised spouse may retain their Turkish citizenship if the marriage should subsequently be dissolved, so long as both partners had entered into the marriage in good faith. == Citizenship by Investment == Since 18 September 2018, Law No 5901 disposes that foreign citizens investing in Turkey will be granted the right to apply for Turkish citizenship. Foreigners who meet any of the following criteria may be eligible for Turkish citizenship: * Made a minimum fixed capital investment of USD 500,000 or equivalent foreign currency or Turkish lira, as attested by the Ministry of Industry and Technology, * Acquired a property worth a minimum of USD 250,000 or equivalent foreign currency or Turkish lira with a title deed restriction on its resale for at least three years, as attested by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, * Created jobs for at least 50 people, as attested by the Ministry of Family, Labor and Social Services, * Deposited at least USD 500,000 or equivalent foreign currency or Turkish lira in banks operating in Turkey with the condition not to withdraw the same for at least three years, as attested by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, * Bought at least USD 500,000 or equivalent foreign currency or Turkish lira worth of government bonds with the condition that they cannot be sold for at least three years, as attested by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, * Bought at least USD 500,000 or equivalent foreign currency or Turkish lira worth of real estate investment fund share or venture capital investment fund share with the condition that they cannot be sold for at least three years, as attested by the Capital Markets Board of Turkey Additionally, the applicant and those family members to be included in the application (kids under 18 and the spouse of the applicant can be included) must have a clear criminal background that will be checked by the internal authorities within Ministry of Interior although a clean-background documents is not necessary. Applicants must submit documents issued in their name that shows their name and surname, name of their fathers and mothers, city of their birth, date of their birth, their ID/passport numbers, their marital status (marriage books if married, documents if divorced or widowed) and other main details about them. Financial declarations are not required as well as criminal background check documents. Turkish Citizenship by Investment Program does not have a pre-approval system that many Caribbean citizenship programs have but also the program's application requirements are easier and approval ratings are higher. The investment made and claimed by the foreign national will be monitored and confirmed by the relevant Government authority. Once the investment is confirmed by the relevant governmental authority, the foreign national will be granted Turkish citizenship. ==Dual citizenship== Dual citizenship is possible in Turkish law. The laws of Turkey provide for acquisition of Turkish citizenship based on one's descent—by birth to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents) in Turkey and also by birth abroad to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents)—regardless of the other nationalities a person might acquire at birth. Children born in Turkey to foreign citizens do not have a claim to Turkish citizenship, unless one of the parents is also a Turkish citizen or the child would otherwise be stateless. The automatic acquisition (or retention) of a foreign nationality does not affect Turkish citizenship. Turkish laws have no provisions requiring citizens who are born with dual nationality to choose one nationality over the other when they become adults. While recognizing the existence of dual nationality and permitting Turkish citizens to have other nationalities, the Turkish government requires that those who apply for another nationality inform the relevant Turkish authority (the nearest Turkish embassy or consulate abroad) and provide the original naturalisation certificate, Turkish birth certificate, document attesting to completion of military service (for males), marriage certificate (if applicable) and four photographs. Dual nationals are not required to use a Turkish passport to enter and leave Turkey; it is permitted to travel with a valid foreign passport (or national ID card for some nationals) and the Turkish National ID card. Since not all countries allow dual citizenship, Turks must sometimes give up their Turkish citizenship in order to naturalise as citizens of another country. == Visa requirements for Turkish citizens == Countries and territories with visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries for holders of Turkish passports Holders of an ordinary Turkish passport may travel without a visa, or with a visa received upon arrival, to 117 countries, as of 1 January 2019 according to the Visa Restrictions Index. ==Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus== Turkey also provides a special sort of \\"passport for foreigners\\" to citizens of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, to enable them to travel freely, as this country is generally not recognized and the local passports are not accepted as valid travel documents in some countries. Citizens of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are also entitled to become citizens of Turkey if they wish and apply to do so. They are exempt from the above criteria.

Since 2011, the brewery has been owned by Molson Coors. It is best known for its flagship ale Doom Bar, named after the notoriously perilous Doom Bar sandbank in north Cornwall. ==History== The brewery has been through three phases – from a small micro brewery, to a larger facility within the same building and finally to the current phase that has seen the Brewery extend its premises to accommodate more vessels and increase its brewing capacity. Unlike many breweries, they do not own or operate any public houses, hotels or restaurants. Their focus is solely on brewing beer. Sharp's also run a joint venture with Paul Ainsworth – the Mariners – in Rock. On 2 February 2011 the brewery was bought by Molson Coors Brewing Company for £20 million. ==Beers== Sharp's produce regular cask ales, seasonal ales, and pasteurised bottled beers. ===Doom Bar bitter=== Doom Bar pump logo Doom Bar on draught alongside other beers in a pub in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. Doom Bar bitter (4.0 abv), the brewery's flagship ale, accounts for nearly 90% of sales. Over of Doom Bar was produced in 2010. In 2011, sales increased by 22 per cent, making it the UK's fastest growing ale for three years in a row. The beer is named after the dangerous Doom Bar sandbank at the mouth of the Camel Estuary in north Cornwall. Cask Doom Bar is brewed at Rock, but bottled Doom Bar has been produced, away, in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, since 2013. This ale can now be found across the UK as well as in Italy, Sweden and Japan. Doom Bar bitter became the first official beer sponsor of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race between 2008 and 2012. Securing the \\"Doom Bar brand\\" was cited as the reason that Molson Coors spent £20 million on their takeover of Sharp's Brewery in 2011; Doom Bar is now the largest cask ale brand in Molson Coors' portfolio. Doom Bar was awarded an International Beer Challenge World Top 50 Beer award in 2006, and a bronze award in 2011 and 2012. In 2010 it won a bronze in the Publican Licensees Choice Awards. It received a Taste of the West bronze award in 2013, along with a Brussels Beer Challenge (Pale and Amber Ale: Bitter) bronze and a PMA Publican's Choice award for national cask ale brand.

Currently two genes ( and respectively) have been identified to code for identical scleraxis proteins. == Function == It is thought that early scleraxis-expressing progenitor cells lead to the eventual formation of tendon tissue and other muscle attachments. Scleraxis is involved in mesoderm formation and is expressed in the syndetome (a collection of embryonic tissue that develops into tendon and blood vessels) of developing somites (primitive segments or compartments of embryos). == Inducing scleraxis expression == The syndetome location within the somite is determined by FGF secreted from the center of the myotome (a collection of embryonic tissue that develops into skeletal muscle)- the FGF then induces the adjacent anterior and posterior sclerotome (a collection of embryonic tissue that develops into the axial skeleton) to adopt a tendon cell fate. This ultimately places future scleraxis-expressing cells between the two tissue types they will ultimately join. Scleraxis expression will be seen throughout the entire sclerotome (rather than just the sclerotome directly anterior and posterior to the myotome) with an overexpression of FGF8, demonstrating that all sclerotome cells are capable of expressing scleraxis in response to FGF signaling. While the FGF interaction has been shown to be necessary for scleraxis expression, it is still unclear as to whether the FGF signaling pathway directly induces the syndetome to secrete scleraxis, or indirectly through a secondary signaling pathway. Most likely, the syndetomal cells, through careful reading of the FGF concentration (coming from the myotome), can precisely determine their location and begin expressing scleraxis. Much of embryonic development follows this model of inducing specific cell fates through the reading of surrounding signaling molecule concentration gradients. == Background == bHLH transcription factors have been shown to have a wide array of functions in developmental processes. More precisely, they have critical roles in the control of cellular differentiation, proliferation and regulation of oncogenesis. To date, 242 eukaryotic proteins belonging to the HLH superfamily have been reported. They have varied expression patterns in all eukaryotes from yeast to humans. Structurally, bHLH proteins are characterised by a “highly conserved domain containing a stretch of basic amino acids adjacent to two amphipathic α-helices separated by a loop”. These helices have important functional properties, forming part of the DNA binding and transcription activating domains. With respect to scleraxis, the bHLH region spans amino acid residues 78 to 131. A proline rich region is also predicted to lie between residues 161–170. A stretch of basic residues, which aids in DNA binding, is found closer to the N terminal end of scleraxis. HLH proteins that lack this basic domain have been shown to negatively regulate the activities of bHLH proteins and are called inhibitors of differentiation (Id). Basic HLH proteins function normally as dimers and bind to a specific hexanucleotide DNA sequence (CAANTG) known as an E-box thus switching on the expression of various genes involved in cellular development and survival. == References == Category:Genetics Category:Gene expression Category:Transcription factors ","title":"Scleraxis"},{"id":"9089051","text":"Reduced to Ashes (2006) is an album by Greek metal band Memorain.http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Memorain/Reduced_to_Ashes/110674 ==Track listing== All songs written by Ilias Papadakishttp://memorain.com/reducedtoashes/ #\\"The Land Of Pain\\" #\\"The Evil Within\\" #\\"Blinded By The Lights\\" #\\"Charge\\" #\\"See / Hate\\" #\\"Reduced To Ashes\\" #\\"TV War\\" #\\"Facing My Demons\\" #\\"Inside My Sickness\\" #\\"Against My Fate\\" #\\"Nothing Is Left\\" #\\"The Lights Into The Night\\" ==Personnel== *Ilias Papadakis - Guitars, Vocals *Alex Doutsis - Guitars *Kostas Bagiatis - Bass *Nick Menza - Drums ===Guests=== *Jeff Waters - Solo on track 7 ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Memorain albums ","title":"Reduced to Ashes (Memorain album)"},{"id":"9089056","text":"Borin Van Loon (born 1952 in East Anglia) is a British illustrator and comic book artist, best known for his illustrations for the Introducing... series of graphic books on complex subjects. He is an author, collagist, and surrealist painter, and has worked for a wide variety of clients in editorial, publishing and promotion. He has created an eclectic collage/cartoon mural on the subject of DNA and genetics for the Health Matters Gallery in London's Science Museum. Van Loon published The Bart Dickon Omnibus of his hero's derring-do in 2005 comprising a surrealist collage graphic novel. Roger Sabin, a writer about comics and lecturer at Central St. Martins in London, England, said of the Bart Dickon series: Van Loon's collage comic strip approach to storytelling relies almost solely upon found images, serendipity in research, and the use of a narrative to bind the images, speech and thought bubbles, and text boxes together. The roots of collage comic-strip can be found in the sound-collage experiments of Ron Geesin, the animations of Monty Python (during the Terry Gilliam era), the surrealist novels of Max Ernst (Une Semaine de Bonté and 'La femme de 100 têtes), the agit-prop visuals of the Situationists, the psychedelic posters and graphics of Martin Sharp and the satires of Biff. Originally appearing as separate strips under the title 'A Severed Head' (a nod to the Iris Murdoch novel), Bart Dickon appeared in Brain Damage, Talking Turkey, Sun Zoom Spark and The Chap magazines. The author gathered a number of these comics, reworked and added new material to create a graphic novella. Van Loon illustrated Capitalism for Beginners, Darwin for Beginners, and DNA for Beginners (in eclectic documentary comic book format) for Writers and Readers in the early 1980s. He has since has illustrated more than a dozen entries in the Introducing... series, published by Icon Books in the UK, including four titles written by Ziauddin Sardar. Van Loon has written, designed and illustrated two model-making books: DNA: The Marvellous Molecule, which enables the reader to build a colour model of the double-helix structure discovered in 1953 by Francis Crick and James D. Watson with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin; and Geodesic Domes, where the models celebrate the pioneering work of Buckminster Fuller. He also painted many oil studies and designed the diagrams for the Letts Pocket Guide To The Weather. /blankpage was a collaborative project with sixteen other artists belonging to Freelance (which Borin chairs) created for Ip-Art 2004.

It was managed by the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation NHS Trust. The main building is a Grade I listed building. ==HistoryConstruction and operation=== Side view of Bootham Park Hospital from Union Terrace. The pavilion on the left is an end-on view of Carr's original building. In 1772, Robert Hay Drummond, the Archbishop of York, decided along with \\"twenty-four Yorkshire gentlemen\\" to establish an asylum, to be known as the \\"County Lunatic Asylum, York\\". A committee was established, and the architect John Carr was co-opted with a pledge of 25 guineas. Carr's patron, the Marquis of Rockingham, pledged 100 guineas, and a total of £2,500 was subscribed. By July 1773, £5,000 had been promised, and Carr's scheme to accommodate 54 patients was approved on 25 August. The building was completed in 1777. Following criticism about the handling of inmates at the asylum and the death of Hannah Mills, who was a Quaker, led the local Quaker community to found a new asylum known as The Retreat in 1790.Digby, A. 1983 Changes in the Asylum: The Case of York, 1777-1815. The Economic History Review New Series, Vol. 36, No. 2 (May), pp. 218–239 The asylum became Bootham Park Hospital in 1904 and it joined the National Health Service in 1948. ===Closure=== In late September 2015 the hospital building was declared unfit by the Care Quality Commission, and ordered to close by the end of the month. Staff were given 5 days notice to close the building. The hospital was closed on 1 October 2015, having been declared unfit for purpose. On the same day Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation NHS Trust replaced Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust as the provider of most mental health services in York. Patients were transferred suddenly to other premises, some quite distant. An independent report commissioned by City of York Council from John Ransford concluded: *The Vale of York Clinical Commissioning Group failed to ensure that the transfer was properly managed; *Leeds & York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust had not properly taken responsibility for the building, although they spent £2.7 million on refurbishing the old building; *If Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation NHS Trust failed to investigate the problems they would be sanctioned; *NHS Property Services significantly underestimated the logistic and practical challenges of upgrading a Grade I listed building where shortcomings had been identified over many years; *The Care Quality Commission gave insufficient attention to the particular issues raised by formal de-registration and registration of facilities, triggered by the transfer of services between agencies. A smaller unit 24 bedded unit opened in 2016 replacing the 36 beds from Bootham Park Hospital. Outpatient clinics also reopened in February 2016. ==References== ==External links== *Hospital archives Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1777 Category:Hospital buildings completed in the 18th century Category:Former psychiatric hospitals in England Category:Hospitals in North Yorkshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in York Category:1770s establishments in England Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct hospitals in England ","title":"Bootham Park Hospital"},{"id":"9089074","text":"Frederick Warren Grover (September 3, 1876 - January 30, 1973) was an American physicist and electrical engineer.

The site of Rembrandtplein held a Regulierspoort or gateway into the city. By 1655, the city had expanded beyond this area and it began to attract visiting farmers who brought their butter, dairy and poultry products to sell in the city and it became known as Botermarkt or butter market. By 1668, the Regulierspoort housed a Waaggebouw or weigh house. Each autumn, the square hosted a fair and the farmers' stalls were replaced by dance orchestras and circus tents. The market continued under this name until 1876 when a statue of Rembrandt by sculptor Louis Royer was moved from the perimeter to the centre of the square and it was renamed Rembrandtplein (eng.: Rembrandt Square). By the early twentieth century, the square developed into a centre for nightlife drawing artists, young people and laborers. To serve these visitors, several hotels, cafés and entertainment venues opened in the adjoining streets. The area continues to be popular with residents and tourists. ==Adjacent area== The square is bordered on the east by Utrechtsestraat, Reguliersdwarsstraat on the south, Regulierbreestraat on the north and Halvemaansbrug on the west. The largest building on the square, across Utrechtsestraat, was designed in 1926 by architects Bert Johan Ouëndag and Hendrik Petrus Berlage as the head office of the Amsterdamsche Bank, later ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO vacated the structure in 2002 and in 2011 it reopened as retail office building named simply The Bank with of space after a five-year renovation. Thorbeckeplein, named after politician Johan Rudolf Thorbecke (1798–1872), is adjacent to the south, and leads to Herengracht. Tram lines 4, 9 and 14 operate on Regulierbreestraat and connect Rembrandtplein to the Stopera, northwest across the Blauwbrug (Blue Bridge) on the Amstel River, Dam Square to the northeast, and Amsterdam Centraal railway station. ==Design== In December 2006, the square became home to a large interactive LCD-screen. The display measures and, in addition to programmed advertisements, allows passers-by to upload videos with a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. At the time of installation, the screen was the largest in Europe at . The statue of Rembrandt was made in 1852 by sculptor Louis Royer and is of cast iron. It was cast in one piece and it is Amsterdam's oldest surviving statue in a public space. The current design of the square is the result of a €3.5 million renovation completed in December 2009. The statue is on a grey granite base bearing a replica of his signature. It occupies a space in the centre of the square facing a plaza paved with matching gray granite slabs accented by planters, trees and a small fountain. The perimeter of the square is bordered by grass and trees. ==The Night Watch== The sculptures of the Night Watch in 3D at the Rembrandtplein in Amsterdam in 2006-2009 As part of the celebration of the artist's 400th birthday in 2006, a bronze-cast representation of his most famous painting, The Night Watch, by Russian artists Mikhail Dronov and Alexander Taratynov was displayed around the Royer work. This bronze-cast representationNightwatch3d.com of the famous painting was on display for three-years before traveling to New York City, Moscow and Oranienbaum, Russia. In 2012, the bronze Night Watch sculptures returned to the redesigned square where they serve as a magnet for visitors.

He was a five-time Olympian for the US, won a bronze medal at the 1960 Olympics, and was the only American men's foil fencer to reach the finals at the world championships until Gerek Meinhardt won a bronze medal in the 2010 World Fencing Championships. ==Fencing careerHigh school=== Axelrod was Jewish, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants who had fled the pogroms, grew up in the Bronx. A heart murmur kept Axelrod from participating in most sports, so his mother encouraged him to learn fencing at Stuyvesant High School in New York City. After graduation in 1938, he studied with 1920 Olympic champion Giorgio Santelli and won amateur titles as a member of the Salle Santelli club. ===College=== Axelrod served in the US Navy in World War II, and then attended the City College of New York. His college team reached the National Team Foil Championships in 1948, the same year he was U.S. Intercollegiate Fencing Association and NCAA Champion. ===US Championships and rankings=== Axelrod was ranked # 1 in the United States in 1955, 1958, 1960, and 1970. He was in the top ten 22 times in the years 1942 to 1970. He was a five-time winner of the National Foil Team Championship (1940, 1950, 1952, 1954, and 1958), and his team won the National Three-Weapon team crown five times (1949, 1952, 1954, 1962, and 1963). ===World Championships=== He was a member of the United States World Championship team four times. His best placing was fifth, in 1958. ===Olympics=== Axelrod was on five U.S. Olympic Teams (1952–68). He won the bronze medal in Individual Foil competition at the 1960 Summer Olympics. ===Pan American Games=== He was also a member of four U.S. Pan American Games teams. He won three team gold medals, one team silver, and four individual silvers in Foil. ===Maccabiah Games=== Axelrod, who was Jewish, won many gold and silver medals in his six appearances at the World Maccabiah Games. ===Approach to fencing=== \\"I have no purely defensive moves\\", Axelrod told The New York Times in 1966. \\"Everyone attributes my skill to the fact that I'm a physical freak, that I have tremendously fast reflexes. I'm not a natural athlete. When it comes to fencing, I'm completely synthetic. I had to practice arduously and break down into tiny components every move I make. ==Editor== Axelrod was the Editor of \\"American Fencing\\" magazine (1986–90). ==Hall of Fame inductions== Axelrod was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1973.

By 1284 the number of canons had declined to seven, and these were evicted in 1285 when the widow Maud de Lacy, Countess of Gloucester(d.1289), formerly the wife of Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester (d.1262), refounded the establishment as a nunnery as the Abbey Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and Saint Etheldreda. In 1286 the abbess was granted licence to hold weekly markets. It was not especially wealthy. The number of historical records that survive for this establishment is not large which limits a full knowledge of its history.

Scotstown Moor Local Nature Reserve (LNR) is located four miles to the north of Aberdeen City Centre, near the residential areas of Dubford and Bridge of Don, at grid reference NJ 935116. The reserve covers roughly 34 hectares and is owned by Aberdeen City Council, who established it as a nature reserve in 1994. It contains the only example of species rich lowland heath in Aberdeen City. ==Site history== Scotstown Moor once formed part of extensive areas of heath and bog around Aberdeen. Other similar habitats such as Ferryhill Moss and Stocket Moor, lying closer to the city, have long since disappeared, being lost to housing. Scotstown Moor remained largely intact up to the 20th century, mainly as a result of its status as a Commonty. This system of land tenure protected the site from enclosure and reclamation by local landowners. Records from 1894 show that the site was not maintained without a struggle, being \\"coveted by neighboring lairds\\", and that several encroachments had been made onto the site. Although the site's status gave the public free access, Scotstown Moor was the property of the Bishopric of Aberdeen and was farmed by the proprietor of Perwinnes. Furthermore, the feuars of Old Aberdeen were granted rights of common grazing, sod cutting, and peat cutting, although little direct evidence of these activities remains today. A Children's Camp was built on the site and ran from the early 1900s until the start of the Second World War. The camp catered for undernourished children, convalescents, and those showing symptoms of tuberculosis. Throughout the early part of this century Scotstown Moor suffered some habitat degradation, largely due to drainage operations. However, the Second World War brought major problems for the site. The need for increased agricultural output led to the reclamation of part of the site, which was then put under intensive cattle grazing. This probably resulted in extensive areas of heather being replaced by grassland. The overall effect has led to fragmentation of the site, particularly serious for the bogs which became more and more isolated, and therefore vulnerable to external influences. In 1869, there was a much larger area of moorland and rural setting compared with today. Currently, Scotstown Moor is surrounded on three sides by housing. There is a new road and conifer plantations to the north. In April 1943, Aberdeen was bombed heavily by the Luftwaffe, a number of bombs were dropped on Scotstown wood adjacent to the moor. During the 1970s, the site faced further pressures. Ownership of the site had passed to the tenant of Perwinnes, who intended to either convert the site fully to agriculture or sell it for housing development. At this time the local authority felt that the site area should remain as a \\"green wedge\\" within new housing planned for the area. However, since the council's \\"Environmental Improvement Scheme\\" involved the clearance of scrub and the afforestation of the moor, this option was hardly less destructive than full scale development. In 1972 the site was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by the Nature Conservancy Council (now Scottish Natural Heritage) largely on the strength of its wet heath and bog. This designation probably protected the site from various planned land-uses which would have proved highly damaging, including drainage, afforestation, housing, and conversion to a golf course. However, housing developments continued around Scotstown Moor, increasing pressure to the site. In 1980, despite the opposition of the NCC, the University of Aberdeen and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT), a new road (Dubford Road) was constructed across one of the wettest and most species rich areas of boy. This resulted not only in the loss of valuable habitat, but also created a new source of pollution close to the moor and almost certainly affected the site's drainage patterns. In 1983 planning permission was granted for housing on over 0.5 ha of land within the SSSI. The remaining part of the SSSI passed into the hands of the local authority, which also acquired land to the north in 1986. The Local Nature Reserve now consists of these two areas. In January 2013 Aberdeen city council announced that Scotstown moor would be converted into a long term \\"travellers\\" site. This announcement was made without any public consultation with local residents of the Bridge of Don. ==Changes in the vegetation over the last 130 years== A comparison of vegetation surveys of Scotstown Moor, performed in 1968 and 1998, shows that the number of plant species in the area has declined. Species have been lost from all habitat types, although those of the open water and open/waste ground have suffered the most. For example, marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), early marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), common twayblade (Listera cordata), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis) and various species of dead nettle (Lamium spp.) have all been lost from the site. The proportion of introduced species at the site has increased significantly from <1% in 1896 to >5% in 1998. This is partly due to planting of non-native conifers (Pinus contorta, Picea abies, Picea sitchensis and Larix decidua) and broadleaves (Acer platanoides), but others, such as Matricaria discoides and Veronica persica (annuals) and Reynoutria japonica (a more persistent and highly invasive species) appear to have colonized naturally. Native tree species which have appeared since 1868 include Betula pendula, Quercus robus, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus avium and Prunus padus. These are all likely to be present in nearby woodland and have probably invaded as a result of natural succession. Willows such as Salix aurita and Salix cinerea are also found in the reserve, although two other species of willow have been lost since 1868. ==Site management objectives== Aberdeen City Council manages each of its nature reserves in accordance with a set of site specific management objectives. Habitat management is obviously an important component of these plans, but informal recreation, environmental education, research and legal and other obligations may all be considered. The site management objectives for Scotstown Moor are summarized here: Site Management Objectives for Scotstown Moor * Operational objective - habitat management # To maintain and enhance the variety of habitats present within the reserve # To maintain and enhance the mosaic of wet heathland and bog habitat. # To maintain and enhance the grassland habitat. # To maintain the plantation and newly planted wooded areas and to seek opportunities to enhance the nature conservation of these areas. # To maintain and enhance the nature conservation value of the small area of acid bog. # To maintain and enhance the acid grassland and marsh habitats. # To enhance the conservation value of the pond. # To safeguard notable species. * Informal recreation # To encourage access to the reserve for informal recreation. # To provide interpretive material and opportunities for the public to learn more about the reserve. # Improve the appearance of the carpark. # Minimize the impact of visitor use on the reserve. * Environmental education # To encourage the use of the reserve for environmental education. * Research # To encourage research work on the reserve. * Obligations # To meet all legal and other complications. ==Site description== The site forms a gentle south facing slope, falling from 80 m to about 60 m above sea level. As a result, drainage is from north to south. The moor falls into the catchment of the Silver Burn, which flows to the south of the site. Seepage of groundwater from the north and west, combined with flow from several springs, feeds the bog formed in a shallow basin at the south end of the reserve. The major soil type is a peaty podzol, freely drained beneath an iron pan. In the southern part of the site, the soils are freely drained iron podzols formed from fluvio-glacial sands and gravel. The reserve is bordered to the east and the west by housing development. Also to the west lies Galshie How, an area of woodland, scrub, and amenity grassland. To the north of the reserve there is an area of unmanaged heathland, grassland, and gorse scrub. More housing is found to the south, as well as mature mixed woodland (part of the Denmore Park estate). Summary of habitat types and species at Scotstown Moor Scotstown Moor consists of four main habitat types including gorse scrub, plantation woodland, marshy grassland, and bog/nutrient rich flushes/standing water. The presence of the nutrient rich flushes makes the site unique in the area, providing the basis for a diverse plant community containing several species of interest. * Gorse scrub Mainly restricted to the southern part of the site, gorse scrub occurs in patches of varying sizes bordered by both bog and grassland. It has been extending into the bog area in recent years. Dominants plants include gorse (Ulex europaeus), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) in wet patches, bell heather (Erica cinerea), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bramble ([Rubus fruticosus). Other species of note include broom ([Cystisus scoparius) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Gorse is a nitrogen-fixing legume which can invade heathlands and grasslands. It regrows after burning or cutting. Its young shoots may be grazed, but mature branches are too spiny. Gorse provides a nesting site for birds such as the yellowhammer and whitethroat. Broom is another invasive woody N-fixing legume. Bracken is one of the commonest and most widespread ferns in the world. It is often the dominant vegetation on heaths, moors, open woods and neglected pastures, especially on acid light soils. Burning encourages its spread since this destroys other plants but does not harm the deep rhizomes of bracken. * Plantation woodland A 50m wide strip of conifers runs across the top of the reserve and extends for approximately 200 m down the eastern boundary. The trees, originally planted as a shelterbelt, include Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Norway spruce (Picea abies), sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and larch (Larix decidua). Of the five tree species listen above, only one (Scots pine) is native. The trees provide a feeding and nesting ground for many birds. The ground flora in this area of the reserve is sparase due to the dense tree canopy, but understory species include the nettle (Urtica diocia), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and broad buckler fern (Dryopteris dilatata) - plants which often characterise pine plantations on areas cleared of alder (Alnus glutinosa) which is still found on site. * Peat bog/nutrient rich flushes/ponds This is the most natural and species rich habitat in Scotstown Moor, supporting plant species now rare in north-east Scotland. The bogs and flushes occur mainly in the southern half of Scotstown moor, although there is a pond in the north-west corner of the site, and a small acid bog in the eastern part of the conifer plantation. Some of the more unusual bog plants include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), grass of parnassus (Parnassia palustris), northern marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza purpurella), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), common butterwort (Pinquicula vulgaris), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and black- bog rush (Schoenus nigricans). The 'bog plants' are so called because they are restricted to waterlogged sites, surviving anoxic soil conditions and low fertility. P. vulgaris and D. rotundifolia are insectivorous, supplementing the poor supply of minerals in boggy areas by digesting insects. S. nigricans is a regionally important species in Aberdeenshire, since although a fairly common species on the west of Scotland, it is only found at Scotstown Moor in the east of Scotland. Other species found in these areas include rushes (Juncus), sedges (Carex), cotton-sedges (Eriophorum), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), marsh bedstraw (Galium palustre), tufted hair grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and Sphagnum species. * Grassland The grassland at Scotstown Moor includes both unimproved and improved areas. The area at the top of Corse hill, north of the conifer plantation, has been grazed in the past, but has not been drained or reseeded. The grassland south of the plantation, however, was ploughed, seeded, and fertilized during the Second World War. The dominant grasses, particularly in the improved grassland, are Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). Yorkshire fog a very widespread and versatile grass able to exploit widely different soil conditions and management practices. It may, however, be limited by grazing or heavy trampling. It is most frequent on relatively fertile soils (pH 5.0–6.0) and is more abundant on moist rather than waterlogged soils, although it can survive in anaerobic conditions. Cocksfoot, another widespread grass, tolerates summer grazing but fares better where grazing is infrequent. It is usually considered to be susceptible to trampling but survives light burning. Other grasses at Scotstown Moor include species of Poa, Lolium, Deschampsia and Agrostis. Heath bedstaw (Galium saxatile) and soft rush (Juncus effusus) are also common but species diversity is unexpectedly low in the grasslands. ==Scotstown Moor Fauna== There is evidence of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and moles (Talpa europaea) at Scotstown Moor and foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) have also been seen in the area. Rabbits graze especially in the grasslands, reducing the biomass of dominant grasses. Voles (Family Muridae) and shrews (Family Soricidae) inhabit the grassland and are preyed on by owls (Asio spp.), sparrowhawks (Accipitur nisus) and kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). Bird life also includes skylarks (Alauda arvensis), which nest in the rough grassland, and various birds that nest in the scrub and woodland. Several species of moths, butterflies, and freshwater invertebrates are also found on the site (listed in \\"Scotstown Moor - a children's guide\\") and the two small ponds provide a habitat for frogs as well as ducks and other wildfowl. ==See also== *Green spaces and walkways in Aberdeen ==References== Category:Parks in Aberdeen Category:Nature reserves in Scotland Category:Moorlands of Scotland ","title":"Scotstown Moor"},{"id":"9089178","text":"Rinko can refer to: *Rinko Kawauchi, photographer *Rinko Kikuchi, actress *Rinko Kimino, author *Rinko Ueda, manga artist ","title":"Rinko"},{"id":"9089179","text":"Portmore Lough () is a small lake in southwest County Antrim, Northern Ireland that drains water into nearby Lough Neagh.

The supports are built on a foundation of concrete poles, while the abutments are resting directly on the bedrock.

He was played by John Inman from 1972 to 1985. The character was played by actor Jason Watkins in a 2016 revival which formed part of BBC Television's Landmarks of Comedy season. ==Role== Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries, born 1938/9, is the junior menswear assistant. His ambiguous sexuality is used as a catalyst for many comedic situations and one-liners. Mr. Humphries is particularly noted for his mincing walk and his high pitched voice, which he discards when answering the phone (which he answers with a booming, deep-pitched \\"Menswear!\\"). He had one of the most famous catchphrases of the era: when asked by a colleague, \\"Mr. Humphries, are you free? [to serve someone]\\", he always gives the camp response, \\"I'm free!\\" He often arrives at work in outrageous attire, ranging from punk rock clothing and hair, motorcycle leather jacket and chaps to scuba gear and sailor uniform, with an equally outrageous accounting of his previous night's activities and efforts to nonetheless make it to work on time. Mr. Humphries frequently speaks of a companion or companions referred to only as \\"my friend.\\" The precise status of this friend is never elaborated upon. It is often said that Mr. Humphries lived with his mother, however, in early episodes, when he speaks to her on the phone, she is coming to visit, or to stay with him. It is only in later series that they appear to be living in the same property. Though Mr. Humphries exhibits many of the behaviors typical of a gay stereotype, his true sexual orientation is never explicitly confirmed in the series. The reticence was a necessity given prevailing attitudes at the time the series was produced: after the first five episodes of Are You Being Served?, a senior BBC executive ordered David Croft to \\"Get rid of the poof\\" from the show – Croft declined, saying: \\"If the poof goes, I go.\\" Many jokes throw Mr Humphries into heterosexual clinches. At one point he is asked to fill in for Mrs. Slocombe at the ladies' counter when a female customer approaches and complains about the stockings she is wearing, lifting up her skirt to show them to him, which caused him to remark that he is \\"riveted to the spot\\" and is considering \\"a whole new way of life.\\" In \\"The Agent,\\" Mr. Humphries, in an attempt to get himself fired in order to take a higher paying position elsewhere, makes a pass at a female customer, only to find out later that she calls his bluff to meet him outside at 5:30. At the end of the episode, while counting his wage packet, he remarks to Mrs. Slocombe that he's got a date at 5:30 and dashes off excitedly. In \\"The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe,\\" Miss Brahms attempted to teach him how to seduce Mrs. Slocombe in order to shake her out of a deep depression. However the lessons work too well and in the end Mr. Humphries passionately throws himself at Miss Brahms. In \\"Conduct Unbecoming,\\" Mr. Humphries is accused of stealing money from his department's till. When he is vindicated (due to the till being faulty), Mr. Rumbold's beautiful blonde secretary throws her arms around him and gives him a passionate kiss, stating: \\"I was always on your side.\\" Mr. Humphries quickly replies that if the kiss had lasted any longer, he would have \\"gone over to your side.\\" Mr. Humphries is usually quite eager to wait on male customers, particularly those with a seemingly homoerotic request. When asked to wait on a gentleman who wanted to buy a dress to wear (at a fancy dress party), the previously busy Mr. Humphries abandons his current customer to assist. In \\"A Change is as Good as a Rest\\" when the staff have to run the Toy Department, Capt. Peacock asks if Mr. Humphries can take over showing a customer the wendy house. Mr Humphries says he is busy, until it is revealed the customer is a sailor, so he stops what he is doing and says \\"I'm free\\". On another occasion, when a fire alarm goes off, Mr. Humphries pretends to faint so that the hunky fire chief will give him a fireman's lift, and in one instance where a delegation of Middle Eastern businessmen visits the store, he is very interested to know more about their homeland when they say that men may touch other men, but not women. However, sometimes Mr Humphries is quite taken aback by gay (or seemingly gay) customers, almost to the point of repulsion. For example, when he is to direct a commercial for Grace Brothers, Mr. Humphries pointedly rejects the advances of the camp cameraman (played by Gorden Kaye). He states to Kaye's character that a couple of gin and tonics in a bar doesn't mean they're more than friends. Mr Humphries also seems to be quite put off by Mrs. Slocombe's references to her \\"pussy\\" (to which she means her cat, one of the many double entendres the television show was known for). He often rolls his eyes when she mentions stroking the cat or having to dry it out after it was soaking wet. Mr. Humphries is rarely shown to have a serious disagreement with his colleagues. Potential disciplinary measures against him are usually the result of a misunderstanding rather than out of any actual wrongdoing or malice. He is the subject of derisory comments or jokes about his perceived sexuality from Mr. Grainger and Captain Peacock on occasion. In one episode, Mrs Slocombe calls him \\"fairy cake\\" and Mr Humphries replies in a hurt voice, \\"It's all coming out now!\\" Later in the same episode, the employees are to vote on which of them should be made redundant; each employee receives exactly one nomination with the exception of Mr. Humphries, who simply writes \\"don't know\\". As Mr. Rumbold points out, this indicated that Mr. Humphries is the \\"most popular\\" person in the department, as nobody voted for him to be made redundant. Despite this, due to his lateness for work, he clashes with Captain Peacock, and due to sarcastic and rude comments towards Mrs Slocombe, he clashes with her (although in general, they get along quite well). In a few episodes Mr. Humphries claims to have served briefly in the Royal Navy. But given his young age, this is impossible. In \\"Fifty Years On\\", \\"Grounds For Divorce\\", \\"The Hold Up\\", and \\"The Pop Star\\", Mr. Humphries makes note of the presence of the audience by occasionally smiling or winking at, or addressing, the audience, thus breaking the fourth wall. Although early seasons contain much discussion over the possibility of Mr. Humphries being promoted to senior sales assistant when Mr. Grainger retires, later seasons have him exclusively as a junior, albeit still senior to Mr. Lucas or Mr. Spooner. Sometimes, this failure to promote is explained when the new junior seems to be more adept at sales than he (such as Mr. Goldberg) and is thus promoted in his place, but in other cases, it is unexplained. From a narrative perspective, the writers had trouble promoting Mr. Humphries because the character seems to work best trapped in the middle of everything, rather than running his own division. Mr Klein takes over as senior sales assistant for four episodes, after which the men's department is only staffed by Mr. Humphries and Mr. Spooner. Mr. Humphries is the only character from the original series to be featured in the Australian version of the original series. ==Grace and Favour== John Inman reprised the role of Mr. Humphries for the spin-off show, Grace and Favour, in 1992. ==Other references== The character is mentioned in sketch comedy series Little Britain. In episode 1 of season 1 Daffyd asks \\"Who was the gay character in Are You Being Served?\\" to which everyone in the pub replies \\"Mr. Humphries.\\" Daffyd replies \\"Really, I thought it was Captain Peacock. He's the one with the moustache.\\" In episode 5 of Ashes to Ashes (set in 1981), DS Carling requests advice on how to act during an undercover investigation in a gay bar, prompting DC Skelton to imitate the trademark exchange: \\"Are you free, Mr. Humphries? I'm freeeee.\\" ==ReferencesAre You Being Served? at the British Film Institute * * Category:Are You Being Served?

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Voždovac. ==Location== Šuplja Stena is located in the woods of the Avala mountain, 22 kilometers south from downtown Belgrade. Located right on the mountain's wind rose, the place has a beneficial effect on human health, especially for the respiratory system. ==Characteristics== Šuplja Stena is a non-residential, recreational complex which in the period of two decades (1970–90) grew into one of the most popular children resorts, mostly for the group vacations organized by the Belgrade's elementary schools. During holiday seasons, the complex was known for hosting several thousands children. The complex covers and area of 12 hectares and includes 2 buildings, 14 bungalows, 3 open swimming pools, soccer, basketball and volleyball fields, etc. The name of the place, šuplja stena, is Serbian for \\"hollow rock\\". The complex also includes a part of the Avala forest, with 1,200 pines and numerous oaks. ==History== The complex was built in the early 1970s by the municipal assembly of Belgrade's central municipality of Vračar. Originally, due to the healing effect of the wind rose, Šuplja Stena was planned as an air spa for the rehabilitation of the children with respiratory problems. It was operational until 1992 when Serbian government designated the place as a shelter for the refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, after the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars. In 2003 the last refugees left Šuplja Stena but the devastated complex remained inactive until February 2012. Šuplja Stena became an object of bitter dispute between the municipality of Vračar and the Serbian state owned forestry company, \\"Srbijašume\\". \\"Srbijašume\\", which owns the lot but not the complex, claimed that the municipality is mismanaging the complex and asked the Republic's Directory for Properties to alienate the facilities from the municipality and that they offered to do reconstruction with their own funds, but that municipality rejected them. Municipality responded that they have absolutely no intention of giving away the complex they built to \\"Srbijašume\\" without any compensation and asked (already in 2002, with a proper offer) to buy the lot, too, because they do not wish to reconstruct Šuplja Stena so that it could be given to someone else, claiming that after 1997 the complex was left ruined and became a gathering place for drug addicts and vagrants. However, the government in 2006 refused to sell the lot to the municipality. The subject was brought to the public attention by the series of articles in newspapers, and in 2007 Vračar officially took over Šuplja Stena again. In February 2012, the reconstruction of one third of the complex was finished and it was open for children. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Belgrade ","title":"Šuplja Stena"},{"id":"9089214","text":"Digital Crimes (2002) is an album by Memorain. ==Track listing== All songs written by Ilias Papadakis, except \\"Digital Crimes\\", \\"Last War - Final Day\\", written by Ilias Papadakis and Kostas Bagiatis, and \\"Visions Of Darkness\\", written by Ilias Papadakis and Panos Andricopoulos #\\"Digital Crimes\\" #\\"Until You Die\\" #\\"Bones\\" #\\"Alone\\" #\\"Turned On You\\" #\\"Extend Of Life\\" #\\"Burning Justice\\" #\\"Last War - Final Day\\" #\\"Silence\\" #\\"Visions Of Darkness\\" ==Credits== * Ilias Papadakis - Guitars, Vocals * Alex Doutsis - Guitars * Kostas Bagiatis - Bass * Panos Andricopoulos - Drums ==References== * Category:2003 albums Category:Memorain albums ","title":"Digital Crimes"},{"id":"9089218","text":"Day trading software is computer software intended to facilitate day trading of stocks or other financial instruments. ==Types of software== Day trading software falls into three main categories: data, charting, and trade execution. ===Important Data=== A day trader needs to know the prices of the stocks, futures, or currencies that it wants to trade. In the case of stocks and futures, those prices come from the exchange where they are traded. Forex is a little different as there is no central exchange. ===Charting=== The vast majority of day traders will chart prices in some kind of charting software. Many charting vendors also supply data feeds. Charting packages all tend to offer the same basic technical analysis indicators. Advanced packages often include a complete programming language for creating more indicators, or testing different trading strategies. ===Trade Execution=== Once traders have their data and can see and analyze it on a chart, they will at some point want to place a trade. To do so, they need to use some kind of trade execution software or electronic trading platform. Many trade execution software allow advanced traders to develop their own trading strategies by using an application programming interface. Most stock brokerage firms will provide proprietary software linked directly to their in-house systems, but many third party applications are available through Independent software vendors. The advantage of third party programs is that they allow the trader to trade through different brokers whilst retaining the same interface. They may also offer a number of advanced features such as automatic trade execution. ==See also== * Electronic trading platform * Extended hours trading * Bloomberg Terminal * Reuters 3000 Xtra * Technical analysis software ==References== Category:Financial software ","title":"Day trading software"},{"id":"9089235","text":"Prolinol is a chiral amino-alcohol that is used as a chiral building block in organic synthesis.

The game is a prequel to Driver: Parallel Lines, and is set two years prior. It is the first and only game in the Driver series for the PSP. It was developed by Ubisoft Reflections and Sumo Digital, and published by Ubisoft. ==Plot== In New York City 1976, the story starts with Ray, a wheelman. He falls in love with Chen Chi, but she's already got someone, Jimmy. After gaining respect from her father, Ray is betrayed and has to earn money in the meantime. He eventually meets back with Zhou, Chen Chi's father, he tells him of how Jimmy is a traitor and for the remainder of the game you must take down Jimmy's empire. After Jimmy is presumably killed in an explosion, Zhou gives Ray his blessing to go out with Chen Chi, but finds out that she has been kidnapped by a scarred Jimmy, however Ray manages to save Chen Chi and shoot down Jimmy's helicopter with a car. ==Gameplay== Mission structure is similar to Driver: Parallel Lines, where driving is an important aspect in gameplay, shooting still remains in the game. Most missions are driving based while some are shootouts or when Ray sits in the back of a car and shoots incoming enemies. One difference that sets Driver '76 from the rest of the Driver series is that it uses comic- styled illustrations rather than cinematic cutscenes, making the game behave more like a comic book. There are 26 main missions, grouped into 6 chapters. The missions get harder as the player progresses through the chapters. Money, cars and weapons are rewarded if missions are successfully completed. ==Setting== The simulation of New York City is similar to the previous installment, but since it is set two years before as a prequel, there are some differences.

The Block is part of the Sycamore Historic District and as such is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district joined the Register in May 1978. The building dates from 1857 when it was owned by Daniel P. James but by the 1860s the building has become known as George's Block.Bigolin, Steve. The Sycamore Historic District: Location 9, Daily Chronicle, 20 November 2006. Retrieved January 14, 2007. ==History== The George's Block began its life in 1857 and was then known as the James Block, after the owner Daniel P. James. James, a prominent citizen, lived in the nearby Jerkin-roofed D. B. James House, also part of the Sycamore Historic District. By the 1860s the James name was gone but the building was still known as a block. Many buildings of the period were known as blocks, usually multi-story and multi-business, the buildings contained retail and professional space or, in the case of George's Block, lecture halls or auditoriums. The third floor of the George's Block, not in use as of 2007, contained a lecture hall where a wide variety of speakers from around the United States would come for presentations. In the first year the building existed such famous men as Horace Greeley, Charles Sumner and Bayard Taylor spoke there. ==Architecture== The George's Block has undergone several changes through the years. Even before the turn of the 20th Century a partial balcony, that had been in place below the second-floor windows of the three story structure, was gone. It is thought that this balcony probably crossed the entire State Street facade of the building. After the turn of the century the balcony had been replaced with awnings. The original brick cornice remains intact. The first floor level once held a variety of storefronts, on both the State and Maple Street sides of the building. Today the building is mostly converted for use as a real estate office. Windows have been slowly replaced or removed over time. The real estate office windows are somewhat in the spirit of the originals and the areas where windows once were on the Maple Street side of the building have long since been bricked over. On the upper floors the double hung windows have been replaced with single pane sashes. Of the 16 third floor windows only three are present, the other thirteen were boarded up through the decades. ==Notes== Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1857 Category:Buildings and structures in Sycamore Historic District Category:Historic district contributing properties in Illinois Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:1857 establishments in Illinois ","title":"George's Block"},{"id":"9089342","text":"The Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle (LCDG) in Ankara, Turkey is a French school in the Turkish capital.

Breakfast sandwiches are served at fast food restaurants (for example, the Burger King breakfast sandwiches) and delicatessens or bought as fast, ready to heat and eat sandwiches from a store. Breakfast sandwiches are commonly made at home. Different types of breakfast sandwich include the bacon sandwich, the egg sandwich, and the sausage sandwich; or various combinations thereof, like the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. The breakfast sandwich is related to the breakfast roll. ==Overview== Breakfast sandwiches are typically made using breakfast meats (generally cured meats such as sausages, patty sausages, bacon, country ham, scrapple, Spam and pork roll), breads, eggs and cheese. These sandwiches were typically regional specialties until fast food restaurants began serving breakfast. Because the common types of bread, such as biscuits, bagels, and English muffin, were similar in size to fast food hamburger buns, they made an obvious choice for fast food restaurants. Unlike other breakfast items, they were perfect for the innovation of the drive-through. These sandwiches have also become a staple of many convenience stores. eggs, bacon jam, and microgreens on a buttermilk biscuit. ==History== Although the ingredients for the breakfast sandwich have been common elements of breakfast meals in the English-speaking world for centuries, it was not until the 19th century in the United States that people began regularly eating eggs, cheese, and meat in a sandwich. What would later be known as \\"breakfast sandwiches\\" became increasingly popular after the Civil War, and were a favorite food of pioneers during American westward expansion. The first known published recipe for a \\"breakfast sandwich\\" was in an 1897 American cookbook. ==Types of bread used== A New-York style bacon & egg sandwich on a roll There are several types of bread used to make breakfast sandwiches: * Hard roll: The traditional breakfast sandwich of the northeast's tri-state region of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. It is believed to be one of the earliest forms of the breakfast sandwich in the United States. It consists of a hard roll, eggs, cheese and sausage, bacon or ham. In New Jersey, a common breakfast sandwich is the Jersey Breakfast which consists of pork roll, egg, and cheese on a hard (Kaiser) roll. * Biscuit: Consists of a large, or cat-head biscuit, sliced, on which meat, cheese, or eggs are served. Popular biscuits include: Sausage biscuit, bacon, tomato, and country ham. Fast food restaurants have put smaller versions of fried chicken fillets on biscuits to create chicken biscuits. Scrambled eggs and/or American cheese are often added. * Bagel sandwiches: Due to their Jewish connection, bagels generally do not contain pork, but other foods associated with the community, such as deli meats, lox or other smoked fish, and cream cheese are used. The bagel and cream cheese is sometimes consumed as a breakfast sandwich. * English muffin: Generally contains egg and cheese with either breakfast sausage or ham. Often served in U.S. fast food outlets such as McDonald's and Starbucks. * Toast: Toasted bread is one of the oldest forms of breakfast sandwich in America, and the closest to the original sandwich in form. While any number of items might be served on toast, eggs and bacon are the ones most associated with breakfast. *Specialty breads: Mostly served by restaurant chains, there are other breakfast sandwiches that do not use one of the common breakfast breads used in the United States. Burger King uses a croissant to make a breakfast sandwich called the Croissan'Wich, or croissant sandwich, depending on the market. McDonald's offers its traditional biscuit fillings on a sandwich made from maple flavored pancakes called a McGriddles. Dunkin' Donuts has a waffle sandwich that is similar to the McGriddles. These can be found at American fast food franchises worldwide. Kangaroo Brands makes a variety of breakfast sandwiches made with pita bread. ==Notes== Category:Cheese sandwiches Category:Egg sandwiches Category:American sandwiches ","title":"Breakfast sandwich"},{"id":"9089352","text":"The Dawkins Delusion? Atheist Fundamentalism and the Denial of the Divine is a book by the theologian Alister McGrath and the psychologist Joanna Collicutt McGrath. It is written from a Christian perspective as a response to arguments put forth in The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. The work was published in the United Kingdom in February 2007 by the Society for Promoting Christian KnowledgeSPCK publication information and in the United States in July 2007. ==Synopsis== McGrath criticizes Dawkins for what he perceives to be \\"a dogmatic conviction\\" to \\"a religious fundamentalism which refuses to allow its ideas to be examined or challenged.\\" He objects to Dawkins' assertion that faith is a juvenile delusion, arguing that numerous reasonable persons chose to convert as adults. He cites himself and Antony Flew as two specific examples. Like Dawkins, McGrath rejects William Paley's watchmaker analogy as specious. To express his true feelings on the subject of irreducible complexity, McGrath instead cites the work of Richard Swinburne, remarking that the capacity of science to explain itself requires its own explanation – and that the most economical and reliable account of this explanatory capacity lies in the notion of the monotheistic God of Christianity. When considering the subject of Aquinas' Quinque viae, to which Dawkins devotes considerable attention, McGrath interprets the theologian's arguments as an affirmation of a set of internally consistent beliefs rather than as an attempt to formulate a set of irrefutable proofs. McGrath proceeds to address whether religion specifically conflicts with science. He points to Stephen Jay Gould's supposition of non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) as evidence that Darwinism is as compatible with theism as it is with atheism. With additional reference to the works of Sir Martin Rees, Denis Noble, and others, McGrath advocates a modified version of NOMA which he terms \\"overlapping magisteria\\". He posits that science and religion co-exist as equally valid explanations for two partially overlapping spheres of existence, where the former concerns itself primarily with the temporal, and the latter concerns itself primarily with the spiritual, but where both can occasionally intertwine. McGrath confirms his position by noting that some prominent scientists are also theists (or at least sympathetic to theism, in Davies' case), pointing specifically to Owen Gingerich, Francis Collins, and Paul Davies as examples. McGrath criticizes Dawkins' portrayal of religion as both an evolutionary by-product and as a memetic virus. McGrath examines Dawkins' use of Bertrand Russell's teapot analogy as well as the basics of Dawkins' theory of Memetics. McGrath criticizes Dawkins for referencing Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough as an authority on anthropology, as he considers the work to be more of \\"a highly impressionistic early work\\" than a serious text. McGrath also points to Dawkins' lack of training in psychology as indicative of an inability to address the most important questions of faith. Quoting Dawkins' description of the Old Testament God as \\"a petty, unjust ... capriciously malevolent bully\\", McGrath counters that he does not believe in such a god and knows no one personally who does. Setting aside Dawkins' remarks, McGrath instead points to Jesus and the New Testament as superior examples of the true nature of Christianity. \\"Jesus\\", McGrath argues, \\"... was the object, not the agent, of violence\\". McGrath suggests that \\"far from endorsing 'out-group hostility', Jesus commanded an ethic of 'out-group affirmation' and Christians may certainly be accused of failing to live up to this command. But it is there, right at the heart of the Christian ethic\\". He believes that Dawkins is right when he argues that it is necessary to critique religion, and right to demand that there be an external criterion for interpreting texts; but argues that Dawkins appears unaware that religions and their texts possess internal means of reform and renewal, and that Dawkins seems unaware of the symbolism of several of the Bible passages which he quotes. McGrath cites the works of numerous authors, including Kenneth Pargament, Harold G. Koenig, and Terry Eagleton, to demonstrate how closely he feels religious faith to be tied to well-being. The Dawkins Delusion? concludes with the suggestions that belief in God has \\"rebounded\\", that Dawkins' work is more theatre than scholarship, and that The God Delusion denotes little more than \\"panic\\" on the part of non- believers. ==Critical reception== Publishers Weekly remarked, Jeremy Craddock, a former forensic biologist who is now a vicar, writes in the Church Times that the McGraths \\"attend rationally to evidence, and present their findings unemotionally to answer The God Delusion ... and make many justified criticisms.\\" He adds that \\"Dawkins asserts that God is so improbable that he cannot exist, and that, if he did, he would need explaining ...\\" But Craddock believes that Dawkins contradicted himself by asserting that the fine tuning of the universe (the seemingly arbitrary values for such constants as the masses of the elementary particles, upon which the universe as we know it depends) needs no such explanation. Craddock concludes, \\"I am sad that Dawkins, once my hero, has descended to unscientific nonsense. McGrath makes much more sense.\\" Bryan Appleyard in the New Scientist says Appleyard goes on to commend the book as \\"a fine, dense, yet very clear account, from [McGrath's] particular Christian perspective, of the full case against Dawkins.\\" Anthony Kenny writes in the Times Literary Supplement that Dawkins is often more accurate than McGrath on historical theology. He gives an assessment of the debate between Dawkins and McGrath while arguing that both men fail to make the crucial distinction between belief in God and faith. He finds it hard to disagree with McGrath's conclusion that The God Delusion is more harmful to science than to religion because \\"most people have a greater intellectual and emotional investment in religion than in science.\\" If forced to choose between them, as Dawkins insists they must, \\"it will be science that they will renounce\\". ==Dawkins' personal response== In a letter to The Times, Dawkins writes that McGrath \\"has now published two books with my name in the title\\" and wonders whether the professor intended to build a career by \\"riding on [his] back\\". McGrath also published Dawkins' God. Responding to the charge that he is \\"dogmatic\\", Dawkins writes that scientists \\"...are humble enough to say we don't know\\". Of McGrath himself, Dawkins remarks, > He's signed up to the Nicene Creed. The universe was created by a very > particular supernatural intelligence who is actually three in one. Not four, > not two, but three. Christian doctrine is remarkably specific: not only with > cut-and-dried answers to the deep problems of the universe and life, but > about the divinity of Jesus, about sin and redemption, heaven and hell, > prayer and absolute morality. And yet McGrath has the almighty gall to > accuse me of a \\"glossy\\", \\"quick fix\\", naive faith that science has all the > answers. Other theologies contradict his Christian creed while matching it > for brash over-confidence, based on zero evidence. McGrath presumably > rejects the polytheism of the Hindus, Olympians and Vikings. He does not > subscribe to voodoo, or to any of thousands of mutually contradictory tribal > beliefs. Is McGrath an \\"ideological fanatic\\" because he doesn't believe in > Thor's hammer? Of course not. Why, then, does he suggest I am exactly that > because I see no reason to believe in the particular God whose existence he, > lacking both evidence and humility, positively asserts? Dawkins interviewed McGrath for his television documentary, Root of All Evil?, which first aired in January 2006 but did not include the interview in the final cut. The interview was included in a DVD set offered for sale on Dawkins's website at one point.http://old.richarddawkins.net/videos/1212-richard-dawkins-and-alister- mcgrath, retrieved 23 April 2014 ==See also== * Relationship between religion and science ==References== ==External links== *\\"The Dawkins Delusion?\\" A critical bookreview by Alex J.

Pravacana is an ancient tradition, whose earliest mentions are found in the Vedic texts but one that is also found in post-Vedic Shastra and Sutra texts of Hindus and Jains. == Buddhism == Pravacana refers to ninefold dhamma in Buddhist texts, and its recitation. It was adopted from the Vedic tradition, and sometimes referred to as Pavachan. == Hinduism == A Hindu pravacana in progress. Pravacana (Sanskrit: प्रवचन) refers to \\"exposition, expounding, reciting, orally explaining, speaking or talking\\" about a spiritual idea or doctrine or treatise in Hinduism, particularly eloquently or excellent expression. The term is found with this sense of meaning in the Rigveda verses 10.35.8 and 4.36.1, in the sense of recitation of Vedic texts in the Yajurveda, in various Brahmanas, Gryhasutras, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, various sutras, as well as the Puranic literature such as the Bhagavata Purana. The term typically refers to discourse, verbal discussion or a recital, but also refers to a textual genre of Indian literature that study a doctrine across texts, propound or synthesize ideas. A speaker is called Pravacanakara. According to Rangaswami, while pravacana is teaching or recital of scriptures, it can also refer to self-recital of a text. The tradition has remained popular in contemporary times, but regionally spelled differently. For example, in Kerala, a pravacana is spelled pathakam, and generally refers to spiritual and moral-filled folklore recital such as Purana-pravacana, according to Raghavan. == Jainism == Pravachan by a Digambara monk The word pravachan is widely used by Jains. In Jainism, the word śrāvaka is used for the householders. The word has its roots in the word śrāvana, i.e. the one who listens (the discourses of the saints). The pravachan by Jain saints could be on Jain principles or Jain scriptures (Shastra Pravachan). During the four- month rainy-season period, when the mendicants must stay in one place, the chief sadhu of every group gives a daily sermon (pravacana, vyakhyana), attended mostly by women and older, retired men, but on special days by most of the lay congregation. During their eight months of travel, the sadhus give sermons whenever requested, most often when they come to a new village or town in their travels. Some Jain texts use the term Pravacana in their title, such as the Pravacana-sara by Kunda-kunda.H. W. Bailey (1937), Review: The Pravacana-sāra of Kunda-kunda Ācārya.

Vasco da Gama was then the 1st Admiral of the Seas of India and in 1524 would become the 6th Governor of Portuguese India under the title of 2nd Viceroy.

Cosmetics in a variety of forms date back to early civilizations, with the need to improve ones personal appearance being an important factor in attracting a mate. Over the years the ingredients have changed dramatically as we discovered how to manufacture our own scents and cosmetic formulas. The realization of the dangers of many common ingredients also greatly affected the growing industry. Ancient Egyptian aristocracy made use of minerals to provide colour and definition to their facial features. During the era of the Greek Empire it was common to use face paints, while the Romans indulged in baths containing oil-based perfume. ==Common ingredients== Castor oil and its derivatives are found in many cosmetics as it is \\"non- comedogenic\\" (does not exacerbate or contribute to acne).International Castor Oil Association. \\"ICOA Technical Bulletins - Effect on Skin \\". Accessed 27 January 2007. Cerebrosides (cells from the nervous systems of cattle or swine) were once used in some high-end skin-care products to increase moisture retention and to create a smooth skin surface,Adams, Cecil. 31 March 2000. \\"Does lipstick contain fish scales?\\". Accessed 24 January 2007. however the BSE controversy has put an end to this practice. In many countries colors in cosmetics are listed as numbers from the Colour Index International. The scheme covers colors used in food, personal care products, cosmetics, household products and fabric dyeing. For example, tartrazine is not normally listed as such in lipstick ingredients, but as C.I. 19140. Erythrosine will be listed as C.I. 45430, and so on. In US and Canada colors are listed as FD & C colors. Tartrazine (E102) is FD & C Yellow 5 and erythrosine (E127) is FD & C Red 3. ===Visual effects=== Strong red colors for eye products have been produced using the dye carmine, made from carminic acid extracted from the crushed bodies of the cochineal insect. Carmine was once the only bright red color permitted by the FDA for use around the eye. Titanium dioxide Pearlescence, also sometimes spelled as \\"pearl essence\\", is a shine or gloss effect commonly used in a wide variety of cosmetic products. The most usual source of pearlescence is the natural mineral mica covered by a thin layer of titanium dioxide. This coating causes goniochromism - the color appears through interference effects with the naturally translucent mica, and varying the thickness of the titanium dioxide changes the color.Weingrod, Carmi. 2005. \\"Three-Dimensional Color - Unlocking the Secrets of Interference Pigments\\". Accessed 24 January 2007. Alternatives exist, including the suspension of tiny flakes of a suitable material within the product, often a wax such as glycol distearate. A shimmery substance found on fish scales, most usually obtained from herring and one of many by-products of commercial fish processing, can also be used for pearlescent effects, primarily in nail polish, but is now rarely used due to its high cost, bismuth oxychloride flakes being used as a substitute instead. ==Types of cosmeticsFacial cosmetics=== The Romans and ancient Egyptians used cosmetics containing mercury. Foundation Women of Roman Britain used a foundation made from animal fat, starch and tin oxide.BBC News. 3 November 2004. \\"Roman cosmetic secrets revealed\\". Accessed 27 January 2007. Today foundations come in a wide variety of formulas and finishes, most are either water, silicone, or mineral based. Foundations on today's market come in cream, liquid, pressed powder, loose powder, or mineral form. They also come in different finishes such as matte or satin depending upon the desired look. Lipstick Lips with various shades of lipstick applied. Lipstick is known to have been used around 5000 years ago in ancient Babylon, when semi-precious jewels were crushed and applied to the lips and occasionally around the eyes. Ancient Egyptians extracted purplish-red dye from fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some bromine mannite, which resulted in serious illness. Cleopatra had her lipstick made from crushed carmine beetles, which gave a deep red pigment, and ants for a base.Johnson, Rita. Chemical and Engineering News. Volume 77, Number 28. 12 July 1999. \\"What's That Stuff? - Lipstick\\". Accessed 27 January 2007. The red color of modern lipstick can come from synthetically derived pure iron oxide (common iron rust), however most leading brands use the more economical synthetic colors. In the United States, every batch of synthetic dye and pigment must have a sample sent to the US FDA for testing and certification that the batch is pure and its contaminants are below the levels specified by law.Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act CHAPTER VII—GENERAL AUTHORITY SUBCHAPTER B—COLORS LISTING AND CERTIFICATION OF COLOR ADDITIVES FOR FOODS, DRUGS, AND COSMETICS Synthetic colors are listed in the ingredients as a code (e.g.: F &D; red no 6) and may contain up to 10 parts per million of lead / 3 parts per million of arsenic.Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Volume 1 -FOOD AND DRUGS, CHAPTER I—FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PART 74—LISTING OF COLOR ADDITIVES SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION There is some controversy over the presence of these trace ingredients, especially since makeup worn on the lips is not just absorbed through the skin, but also swallowed with drinking and eating. Since lowering these levels would make the production and sale of practically all lipstick illegal, and since the FDA has determined that the existing levels are safe, the cosmetic industry continues to produce and sell lipstick. Typically, the pigment is crushed very finely (7 to 10 micrometres) while being mixed with castor oil and is then mixed with a wax base to form a finished lipstick. Lipsticks may be sheer or dense, matte or shiny. In their thinnest and most fluid consistency they are given their own category, lipgloss. ===Perfume=== Islamic cultures contributed significantly in the development of western perfumery in both perfecting the extraction of fragrances through steam distillation and introducing new, raw ingredients. Both of the raw ingredients and distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly chemistry. As traders, Islamic cultures such as the Arabs and Persians had wider access to different spices, herbals, and other fragrance material. In addition to trading them, many of these exotic materials were cultivated by the Muslims such that they can be successfully grown outside of their native climates. Two examples of this include jasmine, which is native to South and Southeast Asia, and various citrus, which are native to East Asia. Both of these ingredients are still highly important in modern perfumery. The Crusaders brought alcohol-based perfumes back to Europe from the Middle East in the 13th Century.Ad*Access. 1999. \\"Brief History of Beauty and Hygiene Products\\". Accessed 27 January 2007. The first modern perfume, made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution, was made in 1370 at the command of Queen Elizabeth of Hungary and was known throughout Europe as Hungary Water. France quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture, cultivating vast amounts of flowers for their essence. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were being specifically grown in the Grasse region of France to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. ===Deodorants and antiperspirants=== Perfume has been used to mask body odor for many hundreds of years, but in the late 19th century the ability to reduce such odour was developed. The original active ingredient of antiperspirants was aluminium chloride but complaints of skin irritation led to the increased use of aluminium chlorohydrate as an alternative. Aluminium has been established as a neurotoxin and has been shown to adversely affect the blood–brain barrier, cause DNA damage, and have adverse epigenetic effects. Research has shown that the aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects to a number of species such as non-human primates, mice, dogs and others. An experiment with mice found that applying an aqueous solution of aluminum chloride to the skin resulted in \\"a significant increase in urine, serum, and whole brain aluminium.\\" Other experiments on pregnant mice showed transplacental passage of aluminum chloride. ==Regulation== Legislation varies from country to country but most countries have some sort of formal legislation that either restrict or prohibit certain ingredients or products. There are two main sources for cosmetics safety: the EU Cosmetics Regulation 1223/2009 and the Canadian Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist. Regulation in the United States by the FDA is particularly weak. A new version of the EU's Cosmetics Directive was adopted by the European Parliament, 24 March 2009.EP legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation on cosmetic products, 24 March 2009 It includes new rules concerning the use of nanoparticles in cosmetics and includes stricter rules on animal testing of cosmetics.EP Press release: \\"MEPs approve new rules on safer cosmetics\\", 24 March 2009 In the European Union, all cosmetic products must be notified through the Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) before being placed on the EU market. The presence of a nanomaterial in a cosmetic product must be explicitly stated in the notification to the European Commission. A list of nanomaterial cosmetics ingredients was published by the European Commission, and the European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) provides further information on these ingredients, including information derived from the application of the REACH regulation on chemicals. Cosmetic colorants, with the exception of hair colorants in the United States, are highly regulated. Each country or group of countries has their own regulatory agency that controls what can go into cosmetics. In the United States, the regulating body is the Food and Drug Administration. Aside from color additives, cosmetic products and their ingredients are not subject to FDA regulation prior to their release into the market. It is only when a product is found to violate Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C; Act) and Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) after its release that the FDA may start taking action against this violation. The FDA may request a recall if the company refuses to remove an unsafe product from the market, work with the Department of Justice to remove contaminated or misbranded products, request a restraining order to prevent further shipments of contaminated or misbranded products, and take action against the company violating the law. A company may use any ingredient, other than color additives and those ingredients banned from use in cosmetics through regulation, as long the completed product and its ingredients is safe, is properly labeled, and isn't contaminated or misbranded under the FD&C; Act and the FPLA. FDA can and does perform inspections.needs working source ==Potential dangers== The search for new ingredients and products often brings controversy, typically over ingredients whose function is unproven or disputed. There are a few potential dangers regarding the use of cosmetics. One such danger is the use of old mascara. Some mascaras contain an ingredient that breaks down to produce formaldehyde. The formaldehyde prevents the growth of bacteria. Aged mascara, however, may no longer be producing formaldehyde, allowing bacteria to proliferate. For this reason, it is often recommended to replace a tube of mascara every few months. In one well-known case, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the \\"Tin Man\\" in The Wizard of Oz. Aluminum dust was used to create a tin effect. As the result of an allergic reaction, he was hospitalized and Jack Haley replaced him. Aluminum dust was, instead, added to a paste. ==See also== *List of cosmetic ingredients *List of vegetable oils *International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) *Testing cosmetics on animals ==References== ==External links== *Cosmetic Safety Database ","title":"Ingredients of cosmetics"},{"id":"9089495","text":"Robert Edison Fulton Jr. (April 15, 1909 – May 7, 2004) was an American inventor and adventurer. He is known for having traveled around the world on a motorcycle and for several aviation-related inventions, among his 70 patents. Fulton was also a professional photographer.EXPLORATIONS: \\"Robert Edison Fulton Jr.\\". - Voice of America. - September 24, 2004. - Retrieved: 2007-03-27 ==Biography== Fulton was born in Manhattan, New York, on April 15, 1909, and named for Thomas Edison, who was a friend of his father, Robert Fulton Sr., a president of Mack Trucks. His maternal grandfather, Ezra Johnson Travis, ran stagecoach lines across the old west after the Civil War, and his uncle, Elgin Travis, who took them over from his father, eventually converted the stagecoach routes into bus lines, which became Greyhound Bus Line. As a teenager, he was in the elite when he traveled by commercial aircraft from Miami, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, in 1921, and then to Egypt when Tutankhamun's tomb was opened in 1923. He attended middle school at Le Rosey in Lausanne, Switzerland, for two years, then went to Exeter and Choate, graduated with a degree in architecture from Harvard in 1931, and spent a further year of architectural study in Vienna at the University of Vienna. At age 23, he traveled 25,000 miles (from London to Tokyo in 18 months) on a twin-cylinder Douglas motorcycle to study architecture around the world. Along the way, he shot 40,000 feet of film of his travels, over the 18-month period.Martin, Douglas. – New York/Region: \\"Robert E.

In 1983, he produced, edited, and released, with his filmmaking sons, a 90-minute film compiled from his home movies, The One Man Caravan of Robert E. Fulton Jr. An Autofilmography.Fulton, R. E. Jr., (1983) – The One Man Caravan of Robert E. Fulton Jr. An Autofilmography – Newtown, Connecticut: Flying Ridge Later in life, he revisited his motorcycle journey in another film program retelling of the epic trip, \\"Twice Upon A Caravan.\\" He then went to work for Pan American Airways, using his skills in cinematography to document the Pan American Clipper (flying boat) air routes from New York to South America and across the Pacific Ocean, just prior to World War II. He then formed a company to manufacture aeronautical equipment, Continental Inc. He married for the first time in 1935, to Florence (Sally) Coburn (1912–1996) of Greenwich, Connecticut, with whom he had three sons — Robert E., III (1939-2002), Travis (1943– ) of Snowmass Colorado, and Rawn (1946– ) of Bernardston, Massachusetts. Divorced in 1982, he later married Anne Boireau Smith of Nantes, France (1926–2002). He died at his home in Newtown, Connecticut on May 7, 2004. ==Inventions== During World War II, Fulton invented the first ground-based aerial flight trainer, but when the military wasn't interested, he modified it into a training aid for aerial gunners, the first fixed aerial gunnery trainer, called the \\"gunairstructor\\". After the war, he designed and built an airplane that was convertible to be an automobile, called the \\"Airphibian\\", because of the time it took to travel to demonstrate the gunnery trainer. Charles Lindbergh flew it 1950 and, although it was not a commercial success (financial costs of air worthiness certification forced him to relinquish control of the company, which never developed it further), it is now in the Smithsonian. During the 1950s, after studying the way trains in Britain pick up mail bags by the side of the tracks, Fulton developed the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, also called the Skyhook for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the United States Navy, and the United States Air Force. It was a system that was used to pick up people from the ground with an aircraft. \\"Robert Fulton's Skyhook and Operation Coldfeet\\". - Central Intelligence Agency. - Retrieved: 2007-03-27\\"Fulton Surface-to-Air Recovery System\\" . - National Museum of the United States Air Force. - Retrieved: 2007-03-27 It was used by the United States Air Force until 1996.

Chatteris Abbey in Chatteris in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire was founded as a monastery for Benedictine nuns in 1016 by Ednoth, Bishop of Dorchester. Before 1310 much of the monastery was destroyed by fire. By the middle of the 14th century, some of the local families appear to have been using the nave of the monastic church as their parochial church. Despite being of little value, the abbey survived the first wave of closures during the dissolution, and was finally surrendered to the Kings commissioners in 1538, by which time there were eleven nuns in residence. At this date many families still used the abbey church as parochial but this, unusually, did not save it from demolition, the parishioners being transferred to another church in the area. A range of the cloister buildings survived as part of a mansion known as Park House. This was demolished in 1847 and the site has now completely vanished beneath streets and housing. == References == * Houses of Benedictine nuns: Abbey of Chatteris, A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 2 (1948), pp. 220–23. * Anthony New.

Under the register, seven fortified towns are depicted, with the name of each town written within the wall. Above each town, an animal grasps its wall with the mr (hoe) hieroglyph. Günter Dreyer has interpreted this scene as a scene of destruction and the animals, or animal standards, as royal names.Wilkinson 1999, p. 42.

Within the context of the film they ostensibly play themselves; however their \\"characters\\" (as perceived by viewers of The Real World) are exaggerated and various facts about their backgrounds and relationships with one another are altered or made fictional. In fact The Real World is never mentioned. ==Plot== The film centers around Norman, who is soon to marry his boyfriend Sky (Perry). Norm's parents do not approve of this, but give him $10,000 to use for the wedding. With this money, he hires Clint (Cowen), a professional wedding video director. He sends Clint out to videotape some of his best friends. This includes Julie (Oliver), a naive country girl who is surprised to find out Norman is gay; and Heather (B.), a street-wise, egocentric African American woman who doesn't really care either way. The three were once roommates in New York City; they lived on Gay Street. Other guests include Norm's Minnesotan lumberjack cousin Sean (Duffy) and his conservative-but-open-minded wife Rachel (Campos) who is eight months pregnant, promiscuous stripper Cory (Murphy), Norm's college buddy Syrus (Yarbrough), and opinionated eurotrash DJ Lars (Schlichting). The group ultimately converge in Norm's castle in Los Angeles where pre-wedding festivities unfold. Crises unfold when the wedding planner Norm has hired discovers he is gay and backs out; when her assistant secretly continues the gig, the planner cancels all of their catering and florists. Additionally it becomes evident to everyone at the wedding that Sky has a female mistress; Cory reveals that Sky is also a gay porn star.

The Buckley–Leverett equation or the Buckley–Leverett displacement describes an immiscible displacement process, such as the displacement of oil by water, in a one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional reservoir. This equation can be derived from the mass conservation equations of two-phase flow, under the assumptions listed below. ==Equation== In a quasi-1D domain, the Buckley–Leverett equation is given by: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial S_w}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left( \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\phi A} f_w(S_w) \\\\right) = \\\\phi\\\\frac{\\\\partial S_w}{\\\\partial x}, where S_w(x,t) is the wetting-phase (water) saturation, Q is the total flow rate, \\\\phi is the rock porosity, A is the area of the cross-section in the sample volume, and f_w(S_w) is the fractional flow function of the wetting phase. Typically, f_w(S_w) is an 'S'-shaped, nonlinear function of the saturation S_w, which characterizes the relative mobilities of the two phases: : f_w(S_w) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_w}{\\\\lambda_w + \\\\lambda_n} = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac{k_{rw}}{\\\\mu_w} }{ \\\\frac{k_{rw}}{\\\\mu_w} + \\\\frac{k_{rn}}{\\\\mu_n} }, where \\\\lambda_w and \\\\lambda_n denote the wetting and non-wetting phase mobilities. k_{rw}(S_w) and k_{rn}(S_w) denote the relative permeability functions of each phase and \\\\mu_w and \\\\mu_n represent the phase viscosities. ==Assumptions== The Buckley–Leverett equation is derived based on the following assumptions: * Flow is linear and horizontal * Both wetting and non-wetting phases are incompressible * Immiscible phases * Negligible capillary pressure effects (this implies that the pressures of the two phases are equal) * Negligible gravitational forces ==General solution== The characteristic velocity of the Buckley-Leverett equation is given by: :U(S_w) = \\\\frac{Q}{\\\\phi A} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} f_w}{\\\\mathrm{d} S_w}. The hyperbolic nature of the equation implies that the solution of the Buckley-Leverett equation has the form S_w(x,t) = S_w(x - U t), where U is the characteristic velocity given above. The non-convexity of the fractional flow function f_w(S_w) also gives rise to the well known Buckley-Leverett profile, which consists of a shock wave immediately followed by a rarefaction wave. ==See also== * Capillary pressure * Permeability (fluid) * Relative permeability * Darcy's law ==References== ==External links== * Buckley-Leverett Equation and Uses in Porous Media Category:Conservation equations Category:Equations of fluid dynamics ","title":"Buckley–Leverett equation"},{"id":"9089820","text":"Ham Castle (also known as Home or Homme Castle) is located in Worcestershire at the bottom of a wooded escarpment (and close to the River Teme), within the parish of Clifton-upon-Teme, about east of the village of Clifton-upon-Teme and south of Great Witley. It was a medieval motte and bailey castle. A hoard of medieval gold and silver was found on the site in the 17th century. Only a mound now remains. ==Archaeology== The field in which the earthworks covering the remains of the medieval castle are located slopes from north to south. The motte (mound) is oval with a north-west/south-east orientation. It is about long and about wide at its widest point and it may have a rock outcrop in its core. It is surrounded by a high platform. Because of the considerable slope in the field the height of the motte compared to its immediate surrounds varies depending on which sided is used for comparison. On the north side the motte is about above the surrounding bailey while on the south side it is between } and high. The summit of the motte is flat, covered with grass and weeds with no visible footings. At the time of one survey (in 1974 or 1986) there had been a fire on the north and south-west of the summit of the motte and stones visible in this area. The bailey on the south-west side is on a steep embankment (and so is probably not very extensive). The bailey on the north to the east sides rises steeply, while that on the north to west sides is flatter, but ploughing has over the years destroyed visible traces of the outer curtain wall and any internal structures. The traces of a double moat, fed from a spring and the Teme is visible and may have extended around the castle. ==History== Ham Castle Farm, in the north-east of the parish, near the Teme, is on the site of the ancient Ham Castle, which, from its commanding position, must at one time have been a stronghold of importance. Historically, little is known of this castle, which is mentioned for the first time in 1207. It evidently belonged to the owners of the manor of Ham, but seems to have been forfeited for some reason by one of them and given with many of their other estates by King John to Thomas de Galweya. cites Pipe R. 12 John, m. 15 d. Thomas was ordered in 1207 to deliver the castle (castellum) to William de Cauntelow to keep during the King's pleasure. cites Rot. Lit.// Pat. (Rec. Com.), 73b. No other direct reference to it has been found, apart from a legal record, in 1288, a plea of dower, mentioning a carucate of land in \\"Castel Homme\\", in Worcestershire.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas: CP 40/70; 1288; between Joyce Mortimer, widow, and William, son of Hugh Mortimer; in \\"Castel Homme\\", as indicated in the book \\"The Whilton Dispute\\" by Prof. Robert Palmer; , page 121, foot note 9 It evidently followed the descent of the manor, but in 1275 and a hundred years later the dwelling at Ham is returned as a capital messuage. cites Cal. Inq. p.m. 1–19 Edw. I, 88; Chan. Inq. p.m. 49 Edw. III, pt. ii, no. 50. A stronghold of some kind seems, however, to have survived. The rest of history of the site may refer to the location now occupied by Ham Castle Farm and its surrounds (some of which are grade II listed structures) that are located about from the site of the earth works identified site of the medieval castle. The house was partly burnt in 1605, cites Nash, Hist. of Worcs. i, 244. In 1605 William Jeffreys obtained Letters Patent confirming the manor of Clifton to him, probably in consequence of his deeds having perished in the fire at Ham Castle. and greatly injured during the Civil War. Tradition says it was besieged and much damaged by the Parliamentary army, whose cannonballs were long preserved there. A cannonball which was dug up on the bank opposite Ham Castle was in the possession of the vicar of Clifton in 1924. The diary of Mistress Joyce Jeffreys, who took refuge there from the Parliamentary forces, contains various entries of fees paid for burying and digging up trunks and other property, according to the movements of the enemy. This upon one occasion seems to have led to the discovery by William Jeffreys, then owner of Ham Castle, of a chest containing \\"gold and silver and other kind of mettalls\\", buried in some long forgotten earlier alarm. cites Liber Niger Scaccarii (ed. Hearne), ii, 593. The vault in which this chest was found was in the middle of \\"an ancient fort made in the fashion of a half moon\\". From the same diary it appears that General Gilbert Gerrard, Governor of Worcester, came to Ham Castle on 12 July 1645 and left the next day. cites Arch. xxxvii, 214. Habington describes Ham Castle as \\"now ruinated\\". cites Surv. of Worcs. (Worcs. Hist. Soc.), i, 168. The 17th-century house which replaced the castle was burnt to the ground in 1887. The dates 1677 and 1680 with the Jeffreys arms on the hopper heads of the rain-water pipes in the large half-timbered mansion of Ham Castle, cites John Noake, Guide to Worcestershire 94. then destroyed, showed that rebuilding was done in those years by Henry Jeffreys. Though much defaced and altered before its final disappearance, the old house retained traces of ancient stateliness in its massive staircase, the oak bookshelves of the old library in the roof, and its beautiful garden terraces. On 1 March 1680 Henry Jeffreys paid 15s. hearth tax for fifteen hearths in his house at Ham Castle. cites Prattinton Coll. (Soc. Antiq.). The ruins at Ham Castle were reserved in a lease of 1759, and the castle is mentioned in conveyances of the manor in 1805 and 1810. cites Recov. R. Trin. 45. Geo. III, m. 351; Hil. 50 Geo.

He was styled Lord Clinton from birth until 1794 and Earl of Lincoln between 1794 and 1795. ==Early life== Pelham-Clinton was the eldest son of Thomas Pelham-Clinton, 3rd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, and his wife Lady Anna Maria (née Stanhope), and was educated at Eton College. His father died when he was ten years old. In 1803, encouraged by the Peace of Amiens which provided a break in hostilities with France, his mother and stepfather took him on a European Tour. Unfortunately, war broke out once again, and the young duke was detained at Tours in 1803, where he remained until 1806. ==Early career== On his return to England in 1807, Pelham-Clinton embarked upon life with many personal advantages, and with a considerable fortune. He married at Lambeth, 18 July 1807, a great heiress, Georgiana Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Miller Mundy of Shipley, Derbyshire. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire from 1809 to 1839 and was also Steward of Sherwood Forest and of Folewood Park. In 1812 he was made a Knight of the Garter. ==Opposition to Catholic Emancipation== On 22 March 1821, Newcastle published a pamphlet in the form of a letter to Lord Liverpool, protesting against a Bill for Catholic Emancipation. Newcastle argued that if his government supported Emancipation they would be doing the country an injustice for two main reasons. Firstly, the attention of the nation was preoccupied with domestic problems and little interested in the question, so to pass Emancipation now would be a betrayal. Secondly, the government could not be neutral on this question because if the Bill passed Parliament, the King would have to refuse Royal Assent as it would be in breach of his promise, made in the Coronation Oath, to uphold the Protestant constitution. If the King were to do this without the advice of his ministers then it would be unconstitutional since the King could only act on the advice of his ministers. Thereby the government should adopt a position on the question, and this position should of necessity be opposed to Emancipation.G. I. T. Machin, The Catholic Question in English Politics. 1820 to 1830 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1964), pp. 29-30. He did not hold any national office but he was extremely active in politics. From about 1826 he became one of the leaders of the so-called \\"Ultra-Tory\\" faction, staunchly supporting the traditional establishment of Church, Country and State. He rejected the label of Tory, however.Charles, Lord Colchester (ed.), The Diary and Correspondence of Charles Abbot, Lord Colchester. Volume III (London: John Murray, 1861), p. 542. On 13 March 1827, Newcastle told Lord Colchester that he wanted to form a group to support the King in forming a government opposed to Emancipation with the aid of Lords Mansfield, Salisbury and Falmouth, and that he could win the support of about 60 peers.Colchester, p. 466. On 24 March Newcastle had an audience with the King, George IV, on the question of Emancipation. However early in the conversation the King interrupted Newcastle, \\"it was only occasionally that I could edge in my remarks & opinions\\". Newcastle said himself and other peers wishes for an administration \\"formed on anti Rom. Cath. principles & that if it would be H.M.'s pleasure to form such an administration it would be certain of support & success\\". The King, however, said a Prime Minister could not be appointed until it was certain that Lord Liverpool would not recover from his stroke.Machin, pp. 96-97. Nerwcastle responded by saying this delay could only help the pro-Emancipation politicians and that himself and other peers would help the King in his choice if he would choose Protestants, \\"not doubtful Protestants but such as are staunch and unequivocal in their opinions\\". The King replied: \\"That you may safely rely upon\\". When Newcastle was going to suggest Lord Eldon as Prime Minister, the King stopped him by saying Eldon was persona non grata and suggested Wellington instead. Newcastle was opposed to this choice and wanted the King to make a stronger declaration in favour of a government opposed to Emancipation. The King was annoyed at this and asked, \\"What more can I do?\\" Newcastle said nothing could be better than his declaration and that if he had the permission to make the King's declaration publicly known. The King would not allow this, however.Machin, pp. 97-98. Newcastle wrote to Lord Colchester on 15 January 1828, that he wanted \\"a sound, plain-dealing Protestant administration, devoid of all quackery and mysterious nonsense\\".Colchester, pp. 537-538. The Duke of Wellington sought Newcastle's support for his new government, and when he learnt that it did not possess Newcastle's confidence (and not receiving a reply to his first letter) he wrote again to him on 31 January, saying: \\"Nothing can be more unpleasant to me than that the friendly Relations between your Grace and the Govt. should be suspended\\". Newcastle finally replied on 4 February, saying his government did not possess his confidence.Machin, p. 111. On 18 September 1828, Newcastle condemned the government for \\"neutrality, conciliation, and modern liberality\\". Wellington \\"may be the victim of a monstrous error\\" but he had supported relieving the Dissenters and his first parliamentary session was \\"by far the most disastrous of any in the memory of man\\". Newcastle advised that those opposed to Emancipation \\"must unite in Protestant associations from one end of the country to the other, and as Parliament is not sitting, they should address their Protestant King\\". Failure to do this might provoke punishment from God.Machin, pp. 134-135. Newcastle led a crowd to Windsor to petition the King against Emancipation. One contemporary Canningite called it \\"radical all over\\".Michael Brock, The Great Reform Act (London: Hutchinson, 1973), p. 57. When in October 1829, Newcastle was criticised for evicting tenants who had voted against his candidates, he famously wrote: \\"Is it presumed then that I am not to do what I will with my own?\\".Brock, p. 63. He repeated this in the Lords on 3 December 1830.Complaint by the Duke of Newcastle. HL Deb 3 December 1830 vol 1 cc750-63 In response to further evictions, The Times rebuked Newcastle for acting like the recently deposed Charles X of France in abusing his power and claimed that his actions were the best argument in favour of reform.The Times (29 September 1830), p. 2. ==Opposition to Reform== Pelham- Clinton was a vehement opponent of electoral reform. This stance led to attacks on his property during the Reform Bill Riots of 1831. Nottingham Castle was burnt to the ground and his residences at Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire and Portman Square, London also had to be fortified against the mob. ==Later life== In 1839, Newcastle objected to the appointment to the magistracy of two gentlemen nominated by the government, but of whose political and religious principles he disapproved (being Dissenters). He wrote a very offensive letter to Lord Chancellor Cottenham, and on his refusing to withdraw it he received a letter on 4 May from Russell informing him, that the Queen had no further occasion for his services as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. Charles Greville wrote in his diary on 2 May: He died at Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, 12 January 1851, and was buried in All Saints' Church, West Markham on 21 January. ==Personal life== Pelham-Clinton married Georgiana Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Edward Miller Mundy, in 1807. They had eight sons and six daughters: * Lady Anna Maria Pelham-Clinton (1808–1822) * Lady Georgiana Pelham-Clinton (1810–1874) * Henry Pelham- Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1811–1864) * Lady Charlotte Pelham- Clinton (1812–1886) * Lord Charles Pelham Pelham-Clinton (1813–1894), married Elizabeth Grant in 1848 and had issue * Lord Thomas Charles Pelham-Clinton (1813–1882), married Marianne Gritton in 1843, separated in 1865 * Lord William Pelham-Clinton (1815–1850), died unmarried * Lt.

In memory of her, the 4th Duke built a church and mausoleum at Milton, Nottinghamshire. In 1833, when the new church at Milton was finished, it became the parish church, replacing the old one at West Markham. This situation was reversed, however, in 1949 when All Saints, West Markham, was reinstated as the parish church, and the Duke's mausoleum was left to decay. Milton Church, now simply a mausoleum, was finally rescued in 1972 when the Churches Conservation Trust took it into guardianship.Newcastle Mausoleum The 4th Duke never remarried and died in January 1851, aged 65. He was succeeded by his eldest son Henry, who was a prominent politician. ==Legacy== The papers of the 4th Duke, including his very detailed personal diaries for the period 1822–1851, are now held by Manuscripts and Special Collections at the University of Nottingham. ==Works== *Letter of the Duke of Newcastle to Lord Kenyon on the Catholic Emancipation Question (1828). *An Address to all classes and conditions of Englishmen (1832). *Thoughts in times past tested by subsequent events (1837). ==Notes== ;Attribution ==References== *Michael Brock, The Great Reform Act (London: Hutchinson, 1973). *Charles Kidd and David Williamson (eds.), Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

Gizmodo also includes the subsite io9, which focuses on science fiction and futurism. Gizmodo is now part of G/O Media, owned by private equity firm Great Hill Partners. ==History== The blog, launched in 2002, was originally edited by Peter Rojas, who was later recruited by Weblogs, Inc. to launch their similar technology blog, Engadget. By mid-2004, Gizmodo and Gawker together were bringing in revenue of approximately $6,500 per month. In 2005, VNU and Gawker Media formed an alliance to republish Gizmodo across Europe, with VNU translating the content into French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, and adding local European-interest material. In 2006, Gizmodo Japan was launched by Mediagene, with additional Japanese contents. In April 2007, Allure Media launched Gizmodo Australia, under license from Gawker Media and incorporating additional Australian content. In November 2007, the Dutch magazine license was taken over by HUB Uitgevers. In September 2008, Gizmodo Brazil was launched with Portuguese content. In September 2011, Gizmodo UK was launched with Future, to cover British news. Gizmodo UK was later shut down in September 2020, with all web links redirecting to Gizmodo.com. In February 2011, Gizmodo underwent a major redesign.This Is the New Gizmodo, Gizmodo.com In 2013, Matt Novak and he moved his Paleofuture blog to Gizmodo from Smithsonian. In 2015, the Gawker blog io9 was merged into Gizmodo. The staff of io9 continued with Gizmodo and continued to post articles on subjects covered by the website, including science fiction, fantasy, futurism, science, technology and astronomy. Gizmodo was one of six websites that was purchased by Univision Communications in their acquisition of Gawker Media in August 2016. Univision in turn sold Gizmodo and an array of sister websites to private equity firm Great Hill Partners in 2019. ==Coverage== A Gizmodo blogger captured the first photos from the floor of the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2007 and, according to Reuters, journalists at the (simultaneous) Macworld debated whether Gizmodo or Engadget had the better live coverage of Steve Jobs' 2007 keynote speech. ==ControversyTV-B- Gone=== Richard Blakeley, a videographer for Gizmodo's publisher, Gawker Media, disrupted several presentations held at CES in 2008. Blakely secretly turned off TVs using TV-B-Gone remote controls, resulting in his being barred from CES 2008, and any future CES events. ===iPhone 4 prototype=== In April 2010, Gizmodo came into possession of what was later known to be a prototype of the iPhone 4 smartphone by Apple. The site purchased the device for US$5,000 from Brian J. Hogan, who had found it unattended at a bar in Redwood City, California, a month earlier. UC Berkeley student Sage Robert, an acquaintance of Hogan, allegedly helped him sell the phone after failing to track down the owner. With Apple confirming its provenance, bloggers such as John Gruber and Ken Sweet speculated that this transaction may have violated the California Penal Code. On April 26, after Gizmodo returned the iPhone to Apple, upon Apple's request California's Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team executed a search warrant on editor Jason Chen's home and seized computers, hard drives, servers, cameras, notes, and a file of business cards, under direction from San Mateo County’s Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe. Since then, Gizmodo and the prosecution have agreed that a special master will review the contents of the items seized and determine if they contain relevant information.

Chants historiques (1824), \\"La Noce du Fils de Zidros et La Mort de Zidros\\", 65ff. ==Biography== Afxentiou was born on 22 February 1928 in the village of Lysi,Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 30 the son of Antonia and Pieris Afxentiou. He had a younger sister named Chrystala. He attended Lysi Primary School and received his secondary education at the Hellenic Gymnasium in Famagusta. Reports by those who knew him were that he was a keen sportsman and passionate about football. He supported the football team Anorthosis. Afxentiou left for Greece, where he was unsuccessful in gaining a place at the Hellenic Military Academy in Athens. In December 1949, he joined the Hellenic Army as a volunteer. From March to October 1950, he attended the Infantry Reserve Officers' Academy on the island of Syros. He then served with the Hellenic Army on the Greek-Bulgarian frontier, as a second lieutenant, before returning to Cyprus and joining the EOKA struggle. He was discharged from the ranks of the Greek Army on 15 November 1953 and returned to Cyprus, where he helped his father with his business by working as a taxi driver. At that time he also got engaged to be married. Afxentiou joined the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA) where he soon became second-in-command, adjutant to EOKA leader George Grivas.Grivas Memoirs (1964) He was originally assigned the regional command of the district of Famagusta which he knew well. It was Grigoris Afxentiou who first thought of obtaining explosives from the sea bed, in shallow waters off the coast of Famagusta, as used by local fishermen to dynamite fish. Explosives were made from the surplus shells dumped in the sea by the British Army at the end of Second World War. Afxentiou was well liked by his peers and it did not take long for General Grivas to promote him to Commander of the Kyrenia district.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 34 In the spring of 1955, he conducted attacks against the British-controlled Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and the electricity company in Nicosia. Known by the code name Zidhros (Ζήδρος), since the day of his attacks, he was top of the British list of most wanted men. They initially proclaimed a reward of £250 for his arrest, which was soon raised to £1,000,\\"Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 33 and then £5,000 pounds for blowing up British property. When the reward was proclaimed, he went into hiding in the Pentadactylos mountain range where he trained EOKA fighters on weapon use and guerrilla warfare. He was very active in the Pentadaktylos range as well as Mount Troodos. During October 1955, on the day after Field Marshal Harding's arrival on Cyprus, Afxentiou raided Lefkoniko Police Station in broad daylight and seized the entire armoury stored there. Although the raid was planned well in advance, it clearly appeared as a challenge to the authority of the Field Marshal, who thereafter pursued Afxentiou zealously.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 48. In December 1955, Afxentiou was relocated on orders of General Grivas to the Troodos mountain range and the General's hideout at Spilia, which led to Afxentiou's involvement in the Battle of Spilia.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 54. On 3 March 1957, after an informant had betrayed his location, the British forces surrounded Afxentiou outside his secret hideout near the Machairas Monastery near Lazanias.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 111 At the time, inside the hideout were Afxentiou and four fellow guerrilla fighters. Realising he was outnumbered, Afxentiou ordered his comrades to surrender but stayed behind to fight to the death. The British asked Afxentiou to surrender his arms but he replied \\"molon labe\\" (\\"come and take them\\"), quoting King Leonidas of Sparta. Unable to drive him out and after sustaining casualties, the British forces resorted to pouring petrol into his hideout and lighting it, burning him alive. In fear of a popular uprising, the British buried his scorched body at the Imprisoned Graves in the yard of the Central Jail of Lefkosia,Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 71 where he lies today.Grivas Memoirs (1964), p. 54 ==References== ==Sources== * The Memoirs of General Grivas by George Grivas, edited by Charles Foley.

Moran played with Manchester United in his teens but was later released in 2006. Prior to the kick-off of the 2007 League of Ireland season, Moran, aged 19, was invited for a trial at Derry City. After impressing manager, Pat Fenlon, he signed for the club on 5 February 2007. Under a month later, he was offered on loan to a Shelbourne side in dire need of players for the beginning of the 2007 season due to serious financial problems at the club. Whilst helping out a fellow league-team, it was also hoped by Derry City that the move would aid Moran's fitness and development. On 27 April 2007, Moran scored his first goal for Shelbourne against Limerick 37, finishing well after good work from James Chambers. He returned to the Derry City at the end of June but was released after the departure of Pat Fenlon from the Derry job. After a short trial with Bohemian in August 2007, Moran signed a one-year contract with Northern Irish club Larne just before the transfer deadline for the 2007–08 season.That's Moran Like It → www.larnefc.co.uk In January 2008, just six months into his contract with Larne, Moran joined Institute.

It may be described as right-left, left-right or bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or pulmonary-to- systemic. The direction may be controlled by left and/or right heart pressure, a biological or artificial heart valve or both. The presence of a shunt may also affect left and/or right heart pressure either beneficially or detrimentally. ==Terminology== Atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt The left and right sides of the heart are named from a dorsal view, i.e., looking at the heart from the back or from the perspective of the person whose heart it is. There are four chambers in a heart: an atrium (upper) and a ventricle (lower) on both the left and right sides. In mammals and birds, blood from the body goes to the right side of the heart first. Blood enters the upper right atrium, is pumped down to the right ventricle and from there to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. Blood going to the lungs is called the pulmonary circulation. When the blood returns to the heart from the lungs via the pulmonary vein, it goes to the left side of the heart, entering the upper left atrium. Blood is then pumped to the lower left ventricle and from there out of the heart to the body via the aorta. This is called the systemic circulation. A cardiac shunt is when blood follows a pattern that deviates from the systemic circulation, i.e., from the body to the right atrium, down to the right ventricle, to the lungs, from the lungs to the left atrium, down to the left ventricle and then out of the heart back to the systemic circulation. A left-to-right shunt is when blood from the left side of the heart goes to the right side of the heart. This can occur either through a hole in the ventricular or atrial septum that divides the left and the right heart or through a hole in the walls of the arteries leaving the heart, called great vessels. Left-to-right shunts occur when the systolic blood pressure in the left heart is higher than the right heart, which is the normal condition in birds and mammals. ==Congenital shunts in humans== The most common congenital heart defects (CHDs) which cause shunting are atrial septal defects (ASD), patent foramen ovale (PFO), ventricular septal defects (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosi (PDA). In isolation, these defects may be asymptomatic, or they may produce symptoms which can range from mild to severe, and which can either have an acute or a delayed onset. However, these shunts are often present in combination with other defects; in these cases, they may still be asymptomatic, mild or severe, acute or delayed, but they may also work to counteract the negative symptoms caused by another defect (as with d-Transposition of the great arteries). ==Acquired shunts in humanBiological=== Some acquired shunts are modifications of congenital ones: a balloon septostomy can enlarge a foramen ovale (if performed on a newborn), PFO or ASD; or prostaglandin can be administered to a newborn to prevent the ductus arteriosus from closing. Biological tissues may also be used to construct artificial passages. Evaluation can be done during a cardiac catheterization with a \\"shunt run\\" by taking blood samples from superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and system arterial. Abrupt increases in oxygen saturation support a left-to-right shunt and lower than normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation supports a right-to-left shunt. Samples from the SVC & IVC are used to calculate mixed venous oxygen saturation :S_vO_2 = \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\times SVC + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\times IVC and Qp:Qs ratio :Qp:Qs = \\\\frac{\\\\text{change in oxygen concentration across the pulmonary circulation}}{\\\\text{change in oxygen concentration across the systemic circulation}} = \\\\frac{P_V - P_A}{S_A - S_V} where P_V is the pulmonary vein, P_A is the pulmonary artery, S_A is the systemic arterial, and S_V is the mixed-venous The Qp:Qs ratio is based upon the Fick principle and it is reduced to the above equation and eliminates the need to know cardiac output and hemoglobin concentration. ===Mechanical=== Mechanical shunts such as the Blalock-Taussig shunt are used in some cases of CHD to control blood flow or blood pressure. ==Reptile== All reptiles have the capacity for cardiac shunts. ==References== Category:Medical terminology ","title":"Cardiac shunt"},{"id":"9089932","text":"A pulmonary shunt refers to the passage of deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the left without participation in gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries. It is a pathological condition that results when the alveoli of the lungs are perfused with blood as normal, but ventilation (the supply of air) fails to supply the perfused region. In other words, the ventilation/perfusion ratio (the ratio of air reaching the alveoli to blood perfusing them) is zero. A pulmonary shunt often occurs when the alveoli fill with fluid, causing parts of the lung to be unventilated although they are still perfused. Intrapulmonary shunting is the main cause of hypoxemia (inadequate blood oxygen) in pulmonary edema and conditions such as pneumonia in which the lungs become consolidated. The shunt fraction is the percentage of blood put out by the heart that is not completely oxygenated. In pathological conditions such as pulmonary contusion, the shunt fraction is significantly greater and even breathing 100% oxygen does not fully oxygenate the blood. ==Anatomical shunt== If every alveolus was perfectly ventilated and all blood from the right ventricle were to pass through fully functional pulmonary capillaries, and there was unimpeded diffusion across the alveolar and capillary membrane, there would be a theoretical maximum blood gas exchange, and the alveolar PO2 and arterial PO2 would be the same. The formula for shunt describes deviation from this ideal. A normal lung is imperfectly ventilated and perfused, and a small degree of intrapulmonary shunting is normal. Anatomical shunting occurs when blood supply to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries is returned via the pulmonary veins without passing through the pulmonary capillaries, thereby bypassing alveolar gas exchange. Capillary shunting is blood that passes through capillaries of unventilated alveoli or deoxygenated blood flowing directly from pulmonary arterioles to nearby pulmonary veins through anastomoses, bypassing the alveolar capillaries. In addition, some of the smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the left ventricle of the human heart. This drainage of deoxygenated blood straight into the systemic circulation is why the arterial PO2 is normally slightly lower than the alveolar PO2, known as the alveolar–arterial gradient, a useful clinical sign in determining the cause of hypoxia. ==Pathophysiology== While in a pulmonary shunt, the ventilation/perfusion ratio is zero, lung units with a V/Q (where V = ventilation, and Q = perfusion) ratio of less than 0.005 are indistinguishable from shunt from a gas exchange perspective. Pulmonary shunting is minimized by the normal reflex constriction of pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia. Without this hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, shunt and its hypoxic effects would worsen. For example, when alveoli fill with fluid, they are unable to participate in gas exchange with blood, causing local or regional hypoxia, thus triggering vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction is triggered by a smooth muscle reflex, as a consequence of the low oxygen concentration itself. Blood is then redirected away from this area, which poorly matches ventilation and perfusion, to areas which are being ventilated. Because shunt represents areas where gas exchange does not occur, 100% inspired oxygen is unable to overcome the hypoxia caused by shunting. For instance, if there is a certain alveolus that is not being ventilated, blood will still flow through the capillary which irrigates it instead of going elsewhere, as the problem does not reside in the perfusion. The rest of capillaries will be working as normal, being saturated of oxygen at the 100% of their capacity. Therefore, there is no use in providing 100% inspired oxygen to the patient, as the blood that is not being oxygenated will not still be able to catch this oxygen, and the other capillaries cannot get it either because they are already 100% saturated. A decrease in perfusion relative to ventilation (as occurs in pulmonary embolism, for example) is an example of increased dead space. Dead space is a space where gas exchange does not take place, such as the trachea; it is ventilation without perfusion.A pathological example of dead zone would be a capillary blocked by an embolus. Although ventilation at that area is unaffected, blood will not be able to flow through that capillary; therefore, at that zone there will be no gas exchange. Dead zones may be corrected by supplying 100% inspired oxygen; when a capillary is blocked, the blood inside of it goes backwards and distributes between other capillaries that are exchanging gases without problem. The resulting blood that flows through them will not be 100% saturated, as it contains some unoxygenated blood (the one that came from the blocked capillary). For this reason, blood will actually be able to obtain the extra oxygen we supply to the patient. Pulmonary shunting causes the blood supply leaving a shunted area of the lung to have lower levels of oxygen and higher levels of carbon dioxide (i.e., the normal gas exchange does not occur). A pulmonary shunt occurs as a result of blood flowing right-to-left through cardiac openings or in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. The shunt which means V/Q = 0 for that particular part of the lung field under consideration results in de-oxygenated blood going to the heart from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. If giving pure oxygen at 100% for five-ten minutes doesn't raise the arterial pressure of O2 more than it does the alveolar pressure of O2 then the defect in the lung is because of a pulmonary shunt. This is because although the PO2 of alveolar gas has been changed by giving pure supplemental O2, the PaO2 (arterial gas pressure) will not increase that much because the V/Q mismatch still exists and it will still add some de-oxygenated blood to the arterial system via the shunt.Egan's Fundamentals of Respiratory Care, p. 951 ==See also== * Shunt equation * Cardiac shunt * Shunt (medical) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Respiratory physiology ","title":"Pulmonary shunt"},{"id":"9089939","text":"thumb Ruwen Faller (born 22 July 1980, in Rheinfelden) is a German sprinter who specializes in the 400 metres.

The two planned to establish a \\"University\\" and — on the suggestion of the invited chair, Lin Hsien-tang — named the institution \\"Yan Ping\\", a dedication to the famous general of the Ming Dynasty, Koxinga. The school opened as a college with only two departments — Economics and Law. The opening ceremony was held on the campus of Kainan Commercial High School on October 10, 1946, and was lit by only one small electric bulb. Zhu addressed the 1100 students under the moonlight, saying: > \\"In this chaotic and dismal time, we have to offer this society a slight ray > of hope, and we have to be like the glittering light of the luminous firefly > found only in a very harsh region of the world.\\" The school came to be known as the first college in Taiwan founded by the Taiwanese. The February 28 Incident occurred immediately after the first semester, on February 27, during the winter vacation. The school was soon shut down by the government, which claimed it was hiding weapons. === The Regeneration === Some years later, the original founders actively sought the revival of the school and their efforts finally convinced the government to allow the school to re-open in September 1948, under the name of Yan Ping Complementary Night High School, using the classrooms of Ximen Elementary School. Although its new status was lower than that of a college, most people regarded it as the revival of Yan Ping College and its original spirit. The school hired many well-known professors, including the former President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui (). === The Palace Above the Water === In 1953, the school moved to present location of Chien-gou S. Road and the construction of a new two story building was completed. The school was surround by water fields and gained the nickname \\"The Palace Above the Water\\". The school had a huge problem enrolling new students at the beginning. It could only make up one single class for the first 5 years, then expanded to 3 classes per year. The total number of students increased from three hundred to three thousand. Most of these came to the school after failing the entry exam for the more prestigious public schools. From 1968, Taiwan started the 9-year compulsory education system, revitalising Yan Ping. The differences between public and private junior high school were eliminated, so more parents were willing to send their child to the school. The new students in the junior high school excelled in the high school entry examination. === The First Private High === In 1979 the school established the \\"direct-promoted class\\", which allowed students to study there for a full 6 years without any additional entry exam. The percentage of seniors from the school entering universities rose substantially. Yan Ping became one of the top 15 high schools throughout Taiwan and reached first place among all the private high schools in the league tables. Students now take the Basic Competence Test (') prior to attending the school. There are still many students came to the Yan Ping because their result on the exam was not as good as expected. The campus has been re-built several times and consists of four buildings today. ==Publications== The Traditional Chinese publications Yanpinger () and YanPing Youth () are written by students of \\"YanPing Youth Club\\"('). There is also an English bimonthly called The Firefly edited mainly by the 11-grade students. The Firefly, reports not just school events, the school newspaper also raises many global or local issues. ==Students' Club== Students at Yan Ping do have access to a limited number of after-class activities.

McCaughey claimed that the Kingsmill massacre of 10 Protestant civilians the following day caused him to pass RUC intelligence to loyalist paramilitaries.Harnden, pp.190-195 He was one of the first police officers on the scene and recalled that ==Further allegations== Weir and McCaughey implicated colleagues in at least eleven other sectarian murders. McCaughey claimed that many local RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) personnel were working with loyalist paramilitaries in the Armagh area in what became known as the Glenanne gang. The Barron Enquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 found a chain of ballistic history linking weapons and killings, to which McCaughey admitted involvement. These included, \\"in 1975, three murders at Donnelly's bar in Silverbridge, the murders of two men at a fake UDR checkpoint, the murder of IRA man John Francis Green in the Republic, the murders of members of the Miami showband and the murder of Dorothy Trainor in Portadown. In 1976, they included the murders of three members of the Reavey family, and the attack on the Rock Bar in Tassagh.\\" In addition > Barron found that it was probable the guns were kept at a farm at Glenanne > belonging to James Mitchell, an RUC reservist ... from which a group of > paramilitaries and members of the security forces ... carried out the > massacres at Dublin and Monaghan....

Weir claimed that McCaughey was part of this \\"Glenanne gang\\", although McCaughey disputed this. McCaughey refused to give evidence to Judge Barron's enquiry, claiming \\"I know nothing about it\\".\\"He should have been slapped in handcuffs\\", Martin Breen, News of the World, 6 March 2005 Judge Barron disagreed. \\"The Inquiry agrees with the view of An Garda Siochana that Weir's allegations regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings must be treated with the utmost seriousness.\\"Houses of the Oireachtas: Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report into the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report). December 2003. p.162 ==Prison and subsequent activities== In prison in the Maze, McCaughey completed a degree in Education and Social Science in 1994 from the Open University. He also claimed that he was \\"a devout member of Ian Paisley's Free Presbyterian Church.\\" McCaughey had had a long association with Paisley, founder and leader of the Free Presbyterian Church, and of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which McCaughey had originally joined in the 1960s. He organised fundraising in prison to help defend DUP deputy leader Peter Robinson in a court case, organising a sponsored run around the prison exercise yard. Ian Paisley wrote a letter of thanks to McCaughey in 1991, promising to try to help try to get his sentence shortened. Paisley wrote in his own handwriting: \\"'There is a door for you to get to the Secretary of State, a door which we were able to open'\\".\\"An old promise to Maze prisoner comes back to haunt Paisley\\", Mervyn Pauley, Belfast News Letter, 22 May 1998 The letter was made public by Paisley's opponents in the run-up to the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. McCaughey was released in 1996. He appears to have become disillusioned with Paisley, allowing his membership of the Free Presbyterian Church to lapse by 1998.\\"Voices of the people caught up in the Troubles\\", Glasgow Herald, 20 May 1998. After his release he was approached by people in Ballymena who told him \\"Great job – pity you got caught\\", which he disagreed with.\\"Society free from UVF arsenals will take time\\" Newshound He declared himself \\"undecided\\" in the Good Friday referendum of that year: \\"I want to support this agreement. I want it to work, but don't want to be endorsing some republican plot.\\" McCaughey became a member of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), the party associated with the UVF. He also started work as a self-employed builder.Police murderer set for pension He became a prominent figure in the weekly picketing of Our Lady's Roman Catholic Church in Harryville, Ballymena, which was organised in protest against the re-routing of Orange Order marches. However, he denied he was the central organiser. He admitted, \\"I have done a few press releases\\" and that he had taken part in the church pickets \\"maybe six times\\" over a 21-week period.\\". McCaughey said he sympathised with the aim of the Harryville protest, which was \\"to secure civil rights\\" for Orangemen in Dunloy.Loyalist denies role as tension over Harryville protest mounts, Deaglan de Breadún, The Irish Times, 7 February 1997 He later claimed that he had 'withdrawn from the protest because of a \\"witch hunt\\" against him by the nationalist media'.Hopes grow for peace at parade, Martina Purdy and Noel McAdam, Belfast Telegraph, 8 February 1997 He was pictured wearing his Orange Order sash during one occasion at the protest.Brian Kennaway The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed Picture Section McCaughey pictured alongside other protesting loyalists wearing his Orange Order sash The Ulster Unionist Party MP Ken Maginnis had called for McCaughey to be returned to jail for his role in the Harryville protest.Brian Kennaway The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed p.55 Some years later McCaughey joined the short lived United Loyalist Cultural Committee, a loyalist group which admitted to having members from the UVF and UDA. In 2001, the Committee threatened to hold regular weekly street protests in a Roman Catholic part of Ballymena until Irish tricolours were removed.Fears grow of a new \\"Harryville\\"; shadowy group plans Ballymena protest, Belfast News Letter, 27 June 2001 The protest was followed by a loyalist attack to remove the flags in Fisherwick estate, Ballymena. Over twenty men were charged with breaching the peace in the incident. McCaughey organised a picket with 20 supporters on the day of the court hearing. He explained: \\"This is not a protest - we are here to show our sympathy for the boys.\\"\\"Loyalists bring Union flag to courthouse\\", Anne Madden, Irish News, 20 July 2001 In 2002, relatives of McCaughey's victim William Strathearn were upset to discover that McCaughey was entitled to his RUC pension for his previous years service in the RUC. When he was sent to prison the then RUC chief constable Jack Hermon opposed any pension for McCaughey but failed on a legal technicality. McCaughey himself justified the pension stating: \\"I've earned it. I did 10 years service fair and square, and I can say that I'm not the only one with a past that has got the pension from the RUC.\\" Along with fellow PUP members in Ballymena in 2003, McCaughey took part in a campaign to stop racist attacks in the town. Immigrant workers from Romania and the Philippines residing in loyalist areas had their homes attacked, leading McCaughey to encourage young loyalists in the town not to join racist groups.\\"PUP campaigns to drive racists out of Ballymena\\" The Guardian In April 2004, McCaughey attended an official dinner with President of Ireland Mary McAleese in Aras an Uachtarain, the Presidential residence in Dublin. McCaughey declared that he intended \\"to invite the President to visit the staunchly Protestant Ballee and Harryville areas of Ballymena\\". McCaughey then withdrew the invitation because of McAleese's \\"Holocaust Day speech in which she compared Protestant prejudice towards Catholics to the Nazi hatred of Jews\\".Loyalists bring Union flag to courthouse, Anne Madden, Irish News, 20 July 2001 In July 2005, a meeting of the District Policing Partnership in the County Antrim village of Clogh had to be abandoned after loyalist protesters, including McCaughey, protested due to the presence of Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor and DPP chairman Declan O'Loan. Protesters shouted sectarian abuse at O'Loan and McCaughey stated the protest could have been avoided if O'Loan \\"had accepted his total unacceptability\\" in Clogh.Loyalists say no to O'Loan-Ballymena Times In August 2005, McCaughey warned that loyalists were considering restarting the picket outside Harryville Roman Catholic Church in Ballymena if Orange Order marchers were rerouted from a mainly Roman Catholic area of the town.\\"No repeat of the Harryville protests\\", Belfast News Letter, 8 August 2005 When republicans proposed their first ever parade in Ballymena in 2005 to commemorate Operation Demetrius, to some surprise McCaughey didn't have any objections to the proposed parade as long as the route wasn't contentious.Republicans to march?-Ballymena Times In 2001, McCaughey stood for election to Ballymena Borough Council, for the PUP in Ballymena South (51 votes, 0.48% - one of two PUP candidates, PUP total: 94 votes, 1.4%) and 2005 (94 votes, 1.6% - sole PUP candidate). He also unsuccessfully contested North Antrim for the assembly elections in 2003 (230 votes, 0.5%).

He was believed to have contracted cancer over a year previously and was thought to be in remission after treatment. The local Ballymena Times reported, \\"McCaughey apparently underwent a 'Road To Damascus' style conversion - supporting the peace process and leading a campaign against Neo Nazis\\". A tribute was also reported from a leading Irish Trade Unionist Peter Bunting. Bunting's father was once held at gun point by McCaughey in 1971 due to the fact he was a Catholic and was forced to leave his job. Bunting stated \\"Billy McCaughey was prepared to kill for what he saw as his people. At the end of his days, he had lived for more people than he could have ever dreamed about in 1971.

It consists of fruits covered in hard candy on bamboo skewers which are approximately 20 cm long. People often mistake tang hulu for regular candied fruits; however, they are coated in a hardened sugar syrup. This sweet and sour treat has been made since the Song Dynasty and remains popular throughout northern China.

The \\"sugar\\" or \\"rock sugar\\" refers to the sugar coating, while the \\"bottle gourd\\" refers to the slight resemblance of the snack to the shape of a gourd. Chinese hawthorn is the traditional fruit used for the skewering, but in recent times vendors have also used various other fruits, such as cherry tomatoes, mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, kiwifruit, bananas, or grapes.

He operated for the game's governing body in the United Kingdom, the British Darts Organisation, from 1985 to 2013, until he resigned and was replaced by Richard Ashdown in April 2013. Fitzmaurice introduced the players after delivering his catchphrase: \\"Are you ready? Ladies and Gentlemen... Let's... Play.... Darts\\". He was affectionately known throughout the darting world as \\"the Fatman\\". ==Early life== Fitzmaurice was born near the Rainbow Suite in Kensington, which would coincidentally be a later venue for the Winmau World Masters. He spent all but six days of his first five years living in Wales during World War II. On returning to London he went to Clement Dane's Grammar School where he stayed on to complete his A-levels. After school he had jobs in a solicitor's office and later worked as an electrician and also a tube train driver. He met his future wife Doreen at Queens Park Rangers football ground and they married in 1964. In spite of this connection with QPR, Fitzmaurice was a passionate supporter of Arsenal. The Fitzmaurices moved to Colchester in 1975 where he was asked to chalk a match (keep track of players' scores) in a local pub which was the start of his long career in darts. ==Early darts career== Shortly after refereeing a youth match in Essex, darts player Bobby George asked Fitzmaurice if he would referee for him in exhibition matches when his regular referee Freddie Williams was unavailable. The two ended up working together for around five years. Then at the World Masters in 1985 regular caller Jack Price was taken ill, Bobby George's persistence with the BDO to use Fitzmaurice paid off and he stood in to fulfil the role. ==BDO career== Fitzmaurice was a chalker at the 1986 Embassy World Final, the first time the tournament had been held at the Lakeside Country Club. He was later the caller/referee and one of his biggest moments came in 1990 when Paul Lim became the first player to achieve a perfect nine-dart finish in the World Championships, which remains to date the only nine-dart finish achieved at the BDO World Championship. Fitzmaurice fulfilled the role as Master of Ceremonies at BDO tournaments for many years - introducing the players onto the stage with his catchphrase, \\"Let's play darts!\\" Fitzmaurice also served as Master of Ceremonies for the celebrity darts tournament Showbiz Darts where he tweaked his catchphrase to \\"Let's play Showbiz Darts\\". He was also synonymous with the British Darts Organisation and made several disparaging comments about the Professional Darts Corporation. Asked in 2004 by the BBC web site whether he took any interest in the PDC World Championship he said, \\"None at all. There's a lot of politics that goes on, and a lot of black propaganda. All we want to do is make our system the best possible for a player.\\" ==Racism controversy== On 7 April 2013 Fitzmaurice made numerous racist and homophobic jokes whilst MC at the BDO British Internationals at Glenrothes, Scotland. On 9 April the BDO announced: \\"The British Darts Organisation apologises unreservedly for the fact that racially offensive comments were made by MC Martin Fitzmaurice at the BDO British Internationals in Scotland on Sunday, April 7th and streamed over the internet. The BDO wishes to make it clear that it does not tolerate racism in any shape or form, and a full enquiry is already taking place into this regrettable incident.\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/martin-fitzmaurice-racist- jokes-storm-1821250 Under BDO rules on racism, Fitzmaurice was made fully aware of the seriousness of his actions and was required to face a disciplinary hearing in front of the BDO Board. On 11 April Fitzmaurice announced that he had offered his resignation which had been accepted. On 20 April the BDO announced Richard Ashdown as his successor. ==Death== On 14 April 2016 it was announced, by the World Darts Federation, that Fitzmaurice had died. This was later confirmed by a statement by the British Darts Organisation chairman. Despite over 30 years of service for the BDO and being one of the most popular figures in the BDO World Championship, his death received little media coverage. ==References== ==External links== * *BBC Q&A; with Fitzmaurice, 2004 Category:1940 births Category:Darts people Category:2016 deaths ","title":"Martin Fitzmaurice"},{"id":"9090025","text":"Lars Figura (born 25 March 1976 in Bremen) is a former German sprinter who specialised in the 400 metres.

The engagement involved approximately 12 members of Georgios Grivas’s EOKA group and a 40 man detachment of the 45 Commando Royal Marines.

Thomas Gallus of Vercelli (ca.1200 – 1246), sometimes in early twentieth century texts called Thomas of St Victor, Thomas of Vercelli or Thomas Vercellensis, was a French theologian, a member of the School of St Victor. He is known for his commentaries on Pseudo- Dionysius and his ideas on affective theology. His elaborate mystical schemata influenced Bonaventure and The Cloud of Unknowing. ==Life== Born in France sometime in the late twelfth century, Thomas Gallus departed in 1219 from Paris, where he lectured in the university, and went to Vercelli in the north of Italy, along with two companions, to establish a new monastery there. This monastery was set up under the initiative of Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, once a papal legate to England and France. Moreover, Bicchieri was a native of Vercelli and wished to establish a monastery and hospital in his home town. By the end of 1225 or the start of 1226, Thomas was appointed abbot of the new monastery. As abbot, he devoted himself not just to the daily administrative tasks of the monastery, but also to composing various commentaries and expositions of the Bible and the writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius. He enjoyed a close relationship with the nascent Franciscan order; indeed, the Franciscans transferred their studium generale from Padua to Vercelli around 1228. He was personally acquainted with St Anthony of Padua. Gallus also knew Robert Grosseteste whom he may have met in 1238 when visiting England to secure a benefice associated with the church of St. Andrew's in Chesterton. Gallus and Grosseteste seem to have exchanged some writings through the agency of Grosseteste's associate, the Franciscan Adam Marsh. When war broke out between the Guelphs of Vercelli and the Ghibellines of the neighbouring town of Ivrea, Gallus was compelled to flee Vercelli in 1243 and take refuge in Ivrea after many grave accusations were made against him by the papal supporters. Some records however suggest that he did manage to return to Vercelli before his death in 1246. A funerary monument to Gallus can be seen today in the Church of Sant’Andrea in Vercelli. ==Thought__NOTOC__== Gallus wrote extensively between about 1218 and his death. Thomas Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius has in recent years been presented as one of two traditions of interpretation of Dionysius that emerged in the thirteenth century, with a 'speculative Dionysianism' developed by the Dominican Albert the Great, and an 'affective Dionysianism' first given systematic formulation in Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius, but with great influence on later vernacular mystical writing.By Paul Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius, (1993). See also Bernard McGinn, 'Thomas Gallus and Dionysian Mysticism', Studies in Spirituality, 8, (1998), pp.81–96. Specifically, this refers to the fact that in the contemporary debate on the relation between love and knowledge in mystical consciousness, Gallus held that affectivity tends to exclude (rather than simply subsume) human knowledge in the highest stages of the mystical itinerary.Bernard McGinn, 'Thomas Gallus and Dionysian Mysticism', Studies in Spirituality, 8, (1998), pp.81–96. ==Works on Pseudo-Dionysius== *1224: Glose super angelica ierarchia (Glosses on the Angelic Hierarchy).The Latin text is in D.

It is in the middle of a triangle formed by Říčany u Prahy, Úvaly and Prague 9 - Koloděje. The population is 345 inhabitants (2006). Neighbouring villages are Sibřina, Květnice, Zlatá, Březí and Křenice, it is only 2 km from the boundary of the Capital city of Prague. In the surroundings there are two hills - Na Baborách and Na Kukli. The brook of Výmola flows through the village. The municipality with an extended authority, to which Sluštice is subordinated, is Říčany u Prahy. There are a football pitch, a pond on the square and 2 more outside the village, a cemetery, a firehouse, a local authority (obecní úřad). The elementary school was closed down in 1985. In the school building a part of the comedy The Snowdrop Festival (in Czech Slavnosti sněženek, 1983, director Jiří Menzel) was filmed. Children attend an elementary school at Škvorec. There are no post office, school, hospital, police station or railway station. ==History== The first written record dates back to 1223 when the village was a property of Mstidruh of Sluštice. Already at that time there was a parish church and a stronghold. It is an evidence that Sluštice was among significant villages. In 1519 it was bought by Marta Pechancová of Bezděkov. At that time the stronghold was not inhabited, it was controlled from Královice and Křenice and the local stronghold ceased to exist. The village of Sluštice belonged to the Královice and Křenice estates. In 1623 (at the time of the Thirty Years' War) Sluštice was confiscated, sold to the Prince Charles of Liechtenstein and incorporated into the estate of Škvorec with which it shared its fate. ===Historical development of the name of the village=== The etymology of the word Sluštice is \\"ves lidí služkových\\" which is \\"a village of servants\\". *1223 Miztidruch de Zluscic *1332 apud judicem de Slusicz *1357 villas Zluchsicz et (and) Zlatho (Zlatá) *1352-1399 decan.

Forum Groningen opened in November 2019, and is expected to receive 1.6 million visitors annually. The center was is located next to the Great Market Square and the New Market and is part of larger reconstruction plans of the Great Market Square's eastern side. == History  Planning === The eastern side of Groningen's Great Market Square was destroyed in World War II. It has subsequently been rebuilt, but its facade has since lost appeal. Municipal authorities initiated plans for its redevelopment in 2005, but met heavy opposition from the city council. A plebiscite was held on 29 June, inviting inhabitants to weigh in. Although 53% of the votes were favorable, results were voided due to a turnout of only 38.5%. Architects were invited to enter an architectural design competition, allowing the city's inhabitants to put together a top three out of a total of seven designs, from which the Forum's winning design was chosen by a municipal council. === Construction === Construction costs were projected to be around 71 million, of which €35 million was paid by the provincial government. Provincial authorities attempted to back out of the project in 2010; threats of legal action led by Jan Terlouw secured its renewed support. Work to demolish the site's original development—a shopping center and a student association building—began in September 2011. The building was slated for completion in 2017, allowing for six years' of construction. However, decades' worth of large-scale drilling in the Groningen gas field has led to an increase in induced earthquakes in the province, whose event count shows an exponential growth in time, and caused a budget overrun and construction to run overdue for two years, as new plans had to be drafted to ensure the building's earthquake-resistance. The building had its official opening on 29 November 2019. == References == == External links == * * Category:2019 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2019 Category:Buildings and structures in Groningen (city) Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in the Netherlands Category:Cultural centers in the Netherlands Category:Event venues established in 2019 Category:Museums in Groningen (province) Category:Public libraries in the Netherlands ","title":"Forum Groningen"},{"id":"9090093","text":"A LAMCO train takes on an iron ore load at Yekepa in 1976 The Liberian- American-Swedish Mining Company (LAMCO) is a defunct Liberian corporation that mined for iron ore in the Nimba range in Liberia during the second half of the twentieth century. Founded in 1955 by American and Swedish investors, the company established the first large-scale mining operation in Liberia following the discovery in the 1950s of the Nimba ore body by geologist Sandy Clarke. The company built a standard gauge railroad approximately 360 km long, linking the mine in the north of the country, to the Port of Buchanan. The Nimba project was managed by LAMCO, Bethlehem Steel, and the Liberian government. Liberia introduced a nationalization policy intended to gradually phase out the non-Liberian staff. By 1989 ore that was profitable for extraction by market rates in the Nimba range had been exploited, but Guinea had large reserves that had not yet been mined. In November 1989, LAMCO was taken over by the Liberian Mining Corporation (LIMINCO), formed to maintain the Liberian ports and railways and to facilitate a joint project with Guinea, known as the Nimba International Minining Company (NIMCO), to extract ore on its side of the border, transport it by a railway to be built to Buchanan, Liberia, and export it by ship. Part of the joint project was construction of a railway from Guinea to the port of Buchanan. Operations were to be managed by the London-based African Mining Consortium Limited (AMCL) under a ten-year contract. Operations were disrupted, but never damaged, several times during the civil war beginning in September 1990 with the invasion of Charles Taylor's forces. For a time private interests continued with the thought of \\"booty futures\\", if Taylor 's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) won the war. He was believed to be siphoning off monies from the mining operations. African nations collaborated to form a force to try to intervene and bring peace; it was known as the Economic Community Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). Its forces captured Buchanan in 1993, and iron ore export operations ceased. Profits had been declining and, as of January 1994, ships were no longer willing to try to pick up ore at the Port of Buchanan because of the state of war. Soon after operations were halted, LIMINCO's sites at the ports of Yekepa and Buchanan were pillaged by warring forces. Such looting continued until 2004. Arcelor Mittal, a European-Indian steel company formed in 2007 and based in the city of Luxembourg, announced that it intended to reactivate the former LAMCO mining operation. It soon encountered financial problems due to decline in the steel demand in Europe. Its business began to improve after 2014 with new contracts with China. == See also == * Transport in Liberia * British Rail Class 08 * British Rail Class 126 * Yekepa ==References== == External links == * Images from Yekepa, the mines and more Category:Mining companies of Liberia ","title":"LAMCO"},{"id":"9090094","text":"Heaven Leigh Casteel is the protagonist of the novels in the Casteel series (1985-1988) created by V. C. Andrews, and concluded by Andrew Neiderman after her death. ==Heaven (1985)== The first novel of the same name, Heaven, commences with Heaven and her family's pitiful struggle against poverty in the hills of the West Virginia mountains. Heaven, her father Luke Casteel, her stepmother Sarah, her four half brothers and sisters, Tom, Fanny, Keith and Our Jane, and her grandparents live in a one bedroom shack in the Willies, the mountains above the town Winnerow. Scorned by the people of the valley as being \\"hill-billies\\" and \\"hill scum\\", Heaven's pride remains intact, although she is wounded by her father, who ignores her as if she does not exist while lavishing attention on the other children. One night, Heaven's granny takes her to the graveyard and shows her a gravestone with the word \\"Angel\\" carved upon it. Heaven learns that the reason for her father's animosity is that her birth caused the death of her real mother, Luke's first wife, whose real name was Leigh VanVoreen, but everybody in the Willies called her 'Angel'. Anny then presents Heaven with her mother's valuable heirloom suitcase, which contains her mother's rich clothes, the like of which Heaven has never seen, and what soon becomes Heaven's most prized possession, a portrait doll that was modeled after her mother. The doll's face is a mirror of Heaven's, except that the doll has silvery blond hair. Heaven flourishes into a gifted student, and she and Tom treasure books and excel in English. Fanny, however, is more interested in boys than books, and acts up with Heaven, constantly reveling in their father's attention. But it is when Heaven meets and captures the heart of Logan Stonewall that Fanny really begins to cause trouble. She always wants what Heaven has, and this becomes a reoccurring theme in their relationship. Logan and Heaven become childhood sweethearts and pledge their hearts and lives to each other. However, Logan is the son of the local pharmacist, and his wealthy mother scorns Heaven as an ignorant hillbilly. After the premature death of Sarah and Luke's fifth child, Heaven's grandmother passes away, causing her grandfather to become senile. Sarah falls into a deep post-natal depression and then disappears, leaving a cryptic note that seems to indicate suicide. The children are left to fend for themselves when their father abandons them as well. Heaven becomes a surrogate mother, skipping school in order to take care of her brothers and sisters, insisting that they attend school even if she cannot. When Luke returns, he brings the devastating news that he is ill with syphilis and that he plans to sell his children for $500 a piece on Christmas Day in order to fund his treatment. Heaven watches heartbroken as her family is split up and sold off. Keith and Our Jane are sold to a wealthy-looking couple, which gives Heaven some comfort as Jane is very attached to Keith. Fanny is sold to the town pastor, Reverend Wise. Tom is sold to farmer, Buck Henry. Heaven is sold to Kitty and Cal Dennison, who live in Candlewick, a sub division in Atlanta. Separated from her siblings and her beloved Logan, Heaven soon realizes that she has been bought as a slave for Kitty, who detested Heaven's mother for marrying Luke, as she was in love with him. After aborting his baby, she discovered she was unable to have any more children and therefore bought Heaven as some sort of twisted revenge against her father. Kitty abuses Heaven physically and emotionally, even scalding her in a burning hot bath to \\"cleanse\\" her of her hillbilly dirt, and burns the beloved portrait doll of her mother. Despite all this, Heaven finds some comfort in her relationship with Cal. Cal lavishes attention on Heaven, buying her clothes, and treating her to all she has been denied in her deprived upbringing, such as films and fine restaurants. Vulnerable and longing for a father figure, Heaven laps up this attention, and is unable to defend herself when Cal's attentions become sexual. When Kitty becomes seriously ill, he seduces Heaven. She is shamed and devastated, blaming herself for what happened, unable to understand why he did this. When Cal announces that they are returning to Winnerow so a dying Kitty can see her parents, she seizes the opportunity to see Logan. However, when she confesses what happened, he runs from her leaving her alone in the world. Heaven is temporarily reunited with Tom, Fanny, and her Grandpa, but, still bitter and hateful, she avoids her father. Upon Kitty's death, Cal abandons her, and she boards a plane for Boston to find her maternal grandparents. ==Dark Angel (1986)== Upon arriving in Boston, Heaven meets Jillian Tatterton, her wealthy grandmother, and her second husband who is 20 years her junior, Tony Tatterton. Tony was Leigh's stepfather, and Heaven is grieved to learn that her real grandfather died several years earlier. The couple take Heaven to Tony's ancestral home, Farthingale Manor, the enormous estate that her mother ran from. Heaven is shocked and deeply hurt to learn however, that her grandparents only expect her for a short visit. Heaven feeds them lies about her mother, including that she didn't give birth to Heaven straight away, but that her parents were married for a year before her birth. Heaven is well accommodated, and resides in the suites that were her mother's. Heaven begins to delve into her mother's past, and comes face to face with a piece of her past when she meets Troy Tatterton, Tony's younger brother who lives in the cottage behind the English maze when Heaven becomes lost in the maze. Heaven is immediately attracted to the handsome and talented Troy, yet is at first reluctant to let Heaven into his life, yet she pressures him into letting down his wall of hostility despite Tony ordering her to stay away from him. Heaven learns that he was three and her mother was twelve when they first met, and Leigh was like an older sister to him. Troy and Heaven eventually become lovers, and Heaven forgets Logan as she discovers her passion and love for Troy are stronger than what she had felt for Logan. Troy soon reveals to her however, that he has premonitions, and dreams that reveal to him that he will not live much longer, and he has no reason to doubt them since all his past dreams have come true, including his dream of Leigh's death. Deeply disturbed but unwilling to lose him, Heaven persuades him to marry her. The two are happy for a brief time, until Troy's detective agency locates Keith and Our Jane. Heaven rushes to 'save them' when Troy becomes ill and wishes her to go on and find them, only to discover once she is there that they no longer need her and that they love their adoptive parents when they deny knowing her. Devastated, she goes to Fanny, who spitefully convinces her to go to Winnerow to get back her baby Darcy that she sold to the Reverend Wayland Wise who adopted her and raped her. Heaven reluctantly agrees, but discovers it is a mistake and impossible once she is there. Once in Winnerow, Heaven runs into Cal, who again bombards her with his needs and wants, and tries to force himself on her. Heaven however, disillusions him and pushes him put of her life forever. Decided on going to find her grandfather in their old cabin, Heaven gets caught in a storm between Winnerow and the Willies, only to be discovered by Logan who finds Heaven's car broken down on the highway, and takes her to the cabin. Heaven however, returns only to discover the money she has been sending her grandfather had been put towards restoring the cabin and it is now an adequate home. As the storm becomes more violent, Heaven comes down with the same illness as Troy. Stuck with no one but Logan to look after her, Heaven submits to his efforts to help her. She dreams of Troy, and in her desperation to get back to him she shouts at Logan to let her contact him. Logan grows jealous and angry, confessing he still loves her and wants her back. When the storm clears and Heaven recovers, she returns to Troy, only to be encountered by Tony who confesses he was pleased by her upcoming marriage to Troy, but that now he cannot let it go ahead. A devastated Heaven forces the truth from him, and he reveals that the reason her mother fled from Farthingale Manor was that he fell in love with her and raped her, and that he discovered from Troy that Heaven was really a year older than she first pretended, and thereby, he is her father. Heartbroken that Troy is her uncle and she cannot marry him, Heaven goes to confess the truth to him, but upon seeing him, she cannot do it. Yet Jillian had revealed the truth to him, having known it all along, and in order to protect Heaven, Troy leaves his home leaving her a letter insisting that she go to Jillian and hear the whole truth. Heaven goes to Jillian's suite, and in revealing and finally accepting the truth, Jillian falls into insanity. Heaven leaves Farthingale Manor to escape the memories of all she has lost, yet upon her return she learns that Troy's prophecy has indeed come true. He killed himself as he was unable to live without her. Devastated, Heaven once again flees to Winnerow, this time to confront her father who has again married and has another son, Drake. Her beloved brother Tom is living with him, and both work at the circus. Heaven is appalled at Tom's willingness to give up his dreams in order to help their father attain his, and as revenge for all he has done she dyes her hair blond, the same shade as her mothers, puts on one of her mothers old dresses, and approaches her father when he is lion taming at the circus. Luke believes his Angel has come back to him, and when he drops his gun, the lion mauls and kills Tom. Blaming herself, she returns to the cabin to become a teacher at the Winnerow school, to pass on her love of books to those in the same position she was. She acknowledges that she will eventually become Logan's wife, as the waters have stilled between them. ==Fallen Hearts (1988)== Proud and beautiful, Heaven comes back to the hills - to rise at last above her family's shame! As Logan's bride, she would savor now the love she had sought for so long. And free from her father's clutches, she would live again in her backwoods town, a respected teacher and cherished wife. But after a wedding trip to Boston's Farthinghale Manor and a lavish, elegant party, Heaven and Logan are persuaded to stay... lured by Tony Tatterton's guile to live amidst the Tatterton wealth and privilege. Then the ghosts of Heaven's past rise up once more, writhing around her fragile happiness and threatening her precious love with scandal and jealousy, sinister passions and dangerous dreams!

Askevold studied art and anthropology at the University of Montana. In 1963, he won a Max Beckmann Scholarship to study painting for a year at the Brooklyn Museum Art School in New York. In 1966, he enrolled at the Kansas City Art Institute to complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, in Sculpture. Askevold went to Halifax and joined the faculty of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1968. ==Projects Class== As a teacher at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in the 1970s, David Askevold developed and led what he called the Projects Class. In what was identified as \\"the most innovative and interesting aspect of the NSCAD curriculum of the period,\\" (Gil McElroy, ARTSatlantic, Spring/Summer 1996). Askevold selected artists, including Dan Graham, Lawrence Weiner, Robert Smithson, Lucy Lippard, Joseph Kosuth and Mel Bochner and invited them to submit projects that he and his students would then carry out. In the Fall of 1969, Robert Barry proposed that the students get together and \\"decide on a single common idea. The idea can be of any nature, simple or complex...\\" Sol LeWitt presented a \\"to do\\" list for the class which included: \\"1. A work that uses the idea of error 2. A work that uses the idea of incompleteness 3. A work that uses the idea of infinity....\\" Robert Smithson suggested a work that would involve mud being dumped over a cliff. Lawrence Weiner asked students to \\"remove\\" some unspecified thing \\"Halfway Between the Equator and the North Pole.\\" ==Artwork== His artwork, often manifested on videotape, is usually the result of a non-strategy based on favorable happenstance, collaboration, and selected circumstance. This method evokes those used by many younger artists today, such as Dave Muller and Rirkrit Tiravanija, who invite the unscripted, unchoreographed participation of others as a necessary part of their artistic practice. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he taught at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CalArts in Valencia, and the University of California, Irvine. Askevold showed at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in 1983 in a group show entitled Head Hunters. He had solo shows at the Thomas Lewallen Gallery in Los Angeles in 1978, the Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles in 1981, and a survey entitled Selected Works 1972–1976 at the University of California, Irvine in 1976. His group shows in the area include Reconsidering the Art Object 1965–1975 at MOCA (1995) and Michael Asher, Richard Long, and David Askevold at Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art (1977). At the 1977 Documenta exhibition at Kassel, Askevold showed Muse Extracts, a 13-part photo text piece of ghost-like photographic reflections of the artist's head and torso taken at a pond near Crystal Crescent Beach in Nova Scotia. In 1985, while teaching as a visiting artist in media arts in Minneapolis, Askevold collaborated with students to produce his only music video, a tape of two songs by the rock and roll band Hüsker Dü. His works are held in the National Gallery of Canada,National Gallery of Canada the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles MOCA website and the Hammer Museum Hammer Museum website Los Angeles. ==References== == External links == * Gallery 1.1.1 * CANADA, NYC * Artfacts * David Askevold: Tributes and Two Hanks Category:Canadian conceptual artists Category:Canadian video artists Category:Artists from Nova Scotia Category:2008 deaths Category:1940 births Category:Kansas City Art Institute alumni Category:University of Montana alumni Category:NSCAD University faculty ","title":"David Askevold"},{"id":"9090108","text":"The is a railway line operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) adjacent to Tokyo Bay, paralleling the western (i.e., inner) shore of the Bōsō Peninsula.

At this time it was renamed the . By 1925 it had been extended to its present-day terminus, Awa- Kamogawa Station. In 1929, the Hōjō Line was incorporated into the Bōsō Line. However, in 1933, the original section between Soga and Awa-Kamogawa Stations again became its own line, this time renamed the , and in 1972 it received its current name. The Soga - Kimitsu section was duplicated between 1964 and 1971, and the entire line was electrified between 1968 and 1971.

There is a building on the northeast corner of the main crossroads containing many retirement flats, this was built in the late 1990s where Grove Park Tavern previously stood. There are two main housing estates in the area. Grove Park Estate, to the southwest of the crossroads is a group of roads all with terraced houses, and some semi-detached houses between Marvels Lane and Chinbrook Meadows that was built by Lewisham council between 1926 and 1929. Chinbrook Estate, to the southeast of the crossroads is several small roads, has two high tower blocks plus many smaller terrace houses and flats and two community centres. It lies in the south east corner of the Grove Park ward but comes under SE9 not SE12 like most of Grove Park. It is surrounded by and has entrances on Marvels Lane, Dunkery Road, Grove Park Road and Mottingham Sports Ground. It was built more recently than Grove Park Estate. ==Chinbrook Meadows== Chinbrook Meadows looking south Chinbrook Meadows sometimes Chinbrook Meadow is one of Lewisham's public open spaces or parks in the south of Chinbrook and Grove Park, the area was previously occupied by Chinbrook Farm, a dairy farm. The park was first formally opened to the public in 1929 and was then a children's play area of , on the edge of the recently built Grove Park Estate; London County Council purchased a further ; and the larger area was opened to the public in June 1937. The majority of the park is maintained short grass with footpaths and lined with tall trees and bisected by the River Quaggy; the grass often has markings for football pitches, a cricket ground and other sports and is used by local schools for sports days. Chinbrook meadows also contains public toilets, public concrete tennis courts, and a football pitch and basketball court in one, plus a children's play area with a paddling pool. Some of the many footpaths crossing the park form part of The Green Chain Walk Green Chain description and Capital Ring. The Quaggy River flows northward through Chinbrook Meadows. In the 1960s the river within the park was channelized into a long straight concrete culverts to alleviate flooding and was closed off behind tall hedges and iron fences, this cut the park in two with the larger part to the east of the river. In the early 2000s however the concrete channel with its fences and hedges was demolished and river was remodeled to give a natural, meandering appearance with a small flood plain; this was to encourage wild plants and animals back to the area and to be more pleasant and attractive for the public. There are several foot bridges with wooden hand rails over the river, that replaced the concrete ones with iron fences. The regeneration was completed on 1 October 2002 and cost a reported £1.1million.Regeneration The small southern part of Chinbrook Meadows became allotments, but many were in disuse in the early 1990s and a government grant paid for trees to be planted on some of the area, although some of the allotments still remain in use. The park is around half a mile long north to south, half as wide and is surrounded by Chinbrook Road to the north, Mayeswood Road to the east and the railway line to the south and west, under the railway line there is a pedestrian subway tunnel that crosses the borough boundary into Bromley and links the park to a much smaller green area southwest of the main park. The footpath that leaves the southeast corner of Chinbrook Meadows is part of the Green Chain Walk passes the allotments then Grove Park Cemetery before entering Elmstead. Gates to the park are opened at 08:00 every morning and closing times range from 16:30 to 21:00 in the evening depending on the time of year.Park opening times ==External links== *Transport for London bus map ==References== Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Lewisham Category:Grove Park, Lewisham ","title":"Chinbrook"},{"id":"9090116","text":"Black sesame soup (sesame tong sui) is a popular east-Asian and Chinese dessert widely available throughout China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.

Townsend House is located in the DeKalb County, Illinois county seat of Sycamore. The home is within the boundaries of the Sycamore Historic District. The district was designated and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 1978. The Queen Anne style home was designed and constructed in 1890 or 1892 by the same architect and general contractor responsible for Altgeld Hall at Northern Illinois University and the nearby DeKalb County Courthouse, as well as the courthouse in Lee County.Bigolin, Steve. The Sycamore Historic District: Location 2, Daily Chronicle, 28 August 2006, Retrieved January 13, 2007. ==Frederick B. Townsend== Frederick B. Townsend was born in Malta Township, DeKalb County, Illinois in 1858. This native son belonged to an elite family tree that included such prominent residents as Daniel Pierce, his maternal grandfather, who founded the National Bank & Trust Co. in 1867. Townsend married Mary Boynton, the daughter of a lender and land speculator in 1890. They eventually became parents to Charles and Eleanor. Eleanor Townsend married Thomas H. Roberts of Clinton Township in 1920. Roberts would go on to found DeKalb Ag, a company later known as DeKalb Genetics Corp. and bearer of the famous corn ear DeKalb logo. That company merged with Monsanto Company in 1998. Townsend was active as a local community leader and served in a variety of positions. At one time or another Townsend was mayor of Sycamore, county judge and instrumental in keeping Sycamore the DeKalb County seat when the courthouse was reconstructed in the early 20th century. ==History== The Townsend House viewed from the lot of what was once the Townsend Garage. Local legend has it that the house was given as a dowry of sorts to Frederick Townsend and his new bride, Mary Boynton, by her father, Charles O. Boynton, in 1890. However, newspaper articles from 1892 indicate that the mansion was new at that time. ==Architecture== The Townsend House, much like the Townsend Garage, a short distance from the mansion, incorporates granite boulders collected from Townsend's many DeKalb County farms. Unlike the Garage, however, only the lower portion of the house and porch facade and the foundation utilizes the boulders. The large granite porch wraps around the house from the front door, the porch includes a porte-cochere and is topped with wooden pillars. Transoms of leaded or stained glass can found on many of the first floor windows. A balcony is on the second floor where the structure has a multi-gabled roof. Both the east and south gables have large Palladian windows. The south gable has what has been termed an \\"M-roof.\\" The enclosed turret is capped with a conical roof and is accessible only from the home's attic. ==Notes== Category:Buildings and structures in Sycamore Historic District Category:Houses in DeKalb County, Illinois Category:Bed and breakfasts in Illinois Category:Historic district contributing properties in Illinois Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ","title":"Frederick B.

It had a well-known retail location on Park Row in Civic Center, Manhattan, across from New York City Hall, from 1971 to 2014. J&R; stands for the founders Joe and Rachelle Friedman who established the company in 1971 after emigrating separately from Israel as young children. The heavily trafficked store had expanded from selling LPs to eventually encompassing J&R; Music World and J&R; Computer World, selling everything from Blu-ray Disc players to the latest electronic gadgets. J&R; also had a location at Columbia University, which closed in late 2002. J&R; later opened a J&R; Express at the bottom level of Macy's Herald SquareMacy*s - Our Stores - Events - Events in 2006, and which was later closed in 2012. ==History== In 1971, 20-year-old newlyweds Joseph and Rachelle Friedman started J&R; as a small consumer electronics store selling stereos and television sets in a 500 square foot store front at 33 Park Row The couple saw it as a side project, selling TVs and stereos out of a 500 square foot store, as Rachelle studied at in Brooklyn. After customers started to ask about obtaining music to play on their new stereos, J&R; started to carry records and tapes. Computers, digital accessories and other electronics products followed. As it grew, J&R; expanded into a series of adjacent storefronts on Park Row, so that the store stretched for a nearly a full block by the mid-1990s, with each storefront providing entry to a different department. The large overall store was increasingly successful and crowded with customers. A mail order division was started in 1974. It was supported by a company owned warehouse located in Maspeth in Queens. Internet orders were later fulfilled from this location. In 2006, J&R; opened J&R; Express, a 3,500 square foot store within a store inside the Macy's Herald Square store. The store carried MP3 players, digital cameras, computers, CDs, DVDs and cell phones. The store also accepted the Macy’s credit card as payment. The store was quietly closed in 2012. Macy's previously tried to sell consumer electronics at the same location with other outside vendors twice in the previous decade. In 2013, J&R; consolidated into two buildings, ceding storefronts to new tenants and transforming into a vertical store. After a disappointing 2013 holiday season, J&R; settled about $15 million in outstanding vendor claims in February 2014. The company owned warehouse facility in Maspeth was listed on the real estate market beginning in October 2013. In addition to left-over merchandise, warehouse and other processing equipment used by the company were auctioned off in late May and again in June. On April 9, 2014, J&R; closed its Park Row store, with a redevelopment plan to be announced. Remaining merchandise were liquidated through a two-day auction in the middle of May 2014. On April 25, 2014, J&R;'s web site stated that the owners planned to \\"rebuild this location into what we hope will be an unprecedented retailing concept and social mecca\\", also stating that they \\"look[ed] forward to sharing more details of these changes in the coming months.\\" The page included an artist's conception of what the location would look like. On August 12, 2014, J&R; announced that they planned to open a 1,500 square foot J&R; Express store inside the flagship location of the Century 21 Department Store in Manhattan by October 2014. Twice magazine reported that the new store would have a format similar to that used by the store that was within Macy's Herald Square store and which closed in 2012. Billboard Magazine reported that J&R; planned to sell audio and video hardware, computers, and electronics, along with some music (including vinyl) and movies. J&R; Express at Century 21 opened in November 2014. Sometime between May and June 2016, J&R; ceased their business relationship with Century with J&R; Express being last recorded on the Century 21 website in an Internet Archive snapshot of March 14 and in the snapshot of the J&R; website of May 5. By June 2, all mentions of J&R; Express had been removed from both websites. Meanwhile, some of the buildings on Park Row that formerly housed J&R; were demolished, starting in January 2016. Other buildings, which were leased, were being redeveloped primarily for residential housing, such as the landmarked Park Row Building at 15 Park Row. In April 2016, it was reported in the New York real estate press that J&R; filed for a building permit to build a 53 story residential building on the demolished site. By late 2018, the former 25 Park Row site had been replaced by a 50-story, 110-unit, luxury condo building with residential unit prices ranging from $1.7 million for one- bedrooms to about $7 million for four-bedrooms, or approximately , called 25 Park Row. According to the Internet Archive, the jr.com website was taken down sometime between January 5 and January 17, 2017, when Network Solutions regained control of the website for resale. ==Online sales== With the main J&R; location just a block from the World Trade Center site, the company lost millions of dollars of electronic equipment due to the September 11, 2001 attacks. But, the company's growing online sales helped sustain the company. J&R; had an Amazon Marketplace agreement with Amazon.com to sell merchandise through that channel, in addition to its own online store. By May 6, 2014, the firm had closed down its website but continued to sell through Amazon.com and eBay. J&R; appeared to be liquidating its existing inventory via these marketplaces and did not show significant stock in major categories such as digital cameras. Both J&R; storefronts on eBay and Amazon had ceased to offer any merchandise for sale by June 2014 after the series of liquidation auctions had occurred at both the former Manhattan store and the Maspeth warehouse in Queens. ==Summerfest== Since the summer of 2002, J&R; had sponsored an annual music festival in City Hall Park, featuring R&B; and other performers. In June 2007, Summerfest performers included Mario, Bobby Valentino, Tank, Carl Thomas, Collie Buddz, and Canadian Brass. == See also == * B&H; Photo Video ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:American companies established in 1971 Category:Civic Center, Manhattan Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Consumer electronics retailers in the United States Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2014 Category:Retail companies established in 1971 Category:Shops in New York City ","title":"J&amp;R"},{"id":"9090146","text":"250px Yaron Golan (; April 26, 1949 – January 23, 2007) was an Israeli publisher.

The screenplay was written by Alan Alda, who also played the title role. The film stars Alda, Barbara Harris, and Meryl Streep, with Rip Torn, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Kimbrough, and Carrie Nye. Meryl Streep said that she was on \\"automatic pilot\\" during filming because she went to work not long after the death of John Cazale, adding that she got through the process largely due to Alda's support. ==Plot summary== Joe Tynan is a liberal U.S. senator from New York with possible presidential ambitions. For the time being, he is weighing the nomination of a potential Supreme Court justice, with the elderly Sen. Birney urging him strongly to support the nominee. Tynan is married, with two children, and his frequent work-related absence is an occupational hazard tolerated by wife Ellie, who is busy studying for a new career as a therapist. When he travels to Louisiana to investigate the nominated judge, he encounters labor lawyer Karen Traynor, who knows of evidence revealing the nominee to be unfit. Their time together results in Tynan and the married Karen beginning a romantic affair. While back in Washington, D.C., engaging in a friendly rivalry with Southern senator Kittner and preparing for the party's upcoming national convention, Tynan begins to realize that Sen. Birney is suffering from a form of early dementia. Ellie, meanwhile, discovers his relationship with Karen, causing considerable friction at home. Tynan breaks off the affair, and makes amends to his wife as he delivers a speech at the convention. ==Cast== * Alan Alda as Joe Tynan * Barbara Harris as Ellie Tynan * Meryl Streep as Karen Traynor * Rip Torn as Senator Kittner * Melvyn Douglas as Senator Birney * Charles Kimbrough as Francis * Carrie Nye as Aldena Kittner * Michael Higgins as Senator Pardew * Blanche Baker as Janet * Chris Arnold as Jerry * Maureen Anderman as Joe's Secretary * John Badila as Reporter on TV Screen * Robert Christian as Arthur Briggs * Maurice Copeland as Edward Anderson * Lu Elrod as Congresswoman at Party * Marian Hailey as Sheila Lerner ==Reception== Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Alan Alda's Joe Tynan isn't altogether believable as a politician, but he's a warm, sensitive, intelligent character, around whom an uncommonly well-meaning movie has been fashioned.\\" Dale Pollock of Variety wrote that the film \\"features a literate script, sensitive direction and a brace of fine performances by Alan Alda, Barbara Harris and Meryl Streep.\\"Pollock, Dale (August 15, 1979). \\"Film Reviews: The Seduction of Joe Tynan\\".

It is located between Chinbrook and Grove Park in the London Borough of Lewisham adjacent to the boundary with the London Borough of Bromley. The park is within the postcode district, next to the border of the postcode district. The majority of the park is maintained short grass with paved footpaths and lined with tall trees and bisected by the River Quaggy which flows northward through the park. The grass often has markings for football pitches, a cricket ground and other sports and is used by local schools for sports days. Chinbrook Meadows contains public toilets, a concrete ball court,a café, a cycle route, a dog exercise area, a football pitch, tennis courts and a children's play area with climbing frames and a sandpit. The numerous footpaths crossing the park form part of The Green Chain Walk Green Chain description and Capital Ring. The Quaggy River flows northward through Chinbrook Meadows. The park is around half a mile long north to south, about half as wide east to west and is surrounded by and has entrances on Chinbrook Road and Amblecote Road to the north, Mayeswood Road to the east, a railway line and Portland Road to the south and west, and Elmstead Wood to the south. Under the railway line there is a pedestrian subway tunnel that crosses the borough boundary into Bromley and links the park to a much smaller green area southwest of the main park. There is no gate separating the two, but the smaller area, being under the authority of another borough the London Borough of Bromley, is sometimes not considered part of the same park, the map on the website does not show it, but shows the park entrance to be the pedestrian subway. The footpath that leaves the southeast corner of Chinbrook Meadows is part of the Green Chain Walk passes some allotments then Grove Park Cemetery before entering Elmstead Wood. Pedestrian gates to the park remain open throughout the night, whilst the car park gates are opened at 08:00 every morning and closed near dusk, with times ranging from 16:30 to 21:00 in the evening depending on the time of year.Park opening times ==History== Chinbrook Meadows looking south The area was previously occupied by Chinbrook Farm, a dairy farm. The park was first formally opened to the public in 1929 and was then a children's play area in size, on the edge of the recently built Grove Park Estate; London County Council purchased a further acres and the larger area was opened to the public in June 1937. A church was built by the Shaftesbury Society as a 'mission hall' on the border of the park in Mayeswood Road in the Grove Park Estate, and dedicated in May 1935. This mission hall was used as a Baptist church until recently when it was taken over by City of Faith Church in 2005 and then by Word of Life Church in 2015. The southern corner of Chinbrook Meadows became allotments, but many were in disuse in the early 1990s and a government grant paid for trees to be planted on some of the area. In recent years many allotments have come back in use and some of the orchard re-claimed as allotments. The Meadows also host the annual Grove Park Carnival & Chinbrook Dog Show . ===River Quaggy=== Footbridge over the River Quaggy, in Chinbrook Meadows In the 1960s the River Quaggy within Chinbrook Meadows and other parks was channelized into long straight concrete culverts to alleviate flooding and was closed off behind tall hedges and iron fences, this cut the park in two with the larger part to the east of the river. In the early 2000s however the concrete channel with its fences and hedges was demolished and river was remodeled to give a natural, meandering appearance with a small flood plain; this was to encourage wild plants and animals back to the area and to be more pleasant and attractive for the public. There are several wooden foot bridges over the river, that replaced the concrete ones with iron fences. The regeneration was completed on 1 October 2002 and cost a reported £1.1million.Regeneration Since the restoration Chinbrook Meadows has won the Green Flag Award in two years in a row.Green Flag Award Shortly After the regeneration was completed the same river was given a similar regeneration further down stream within Sutcliffe Park, a mile and a half to the north.Sutcliffe Park regeneration Sutcliffe Park regeneration ==Transport links== There are bus stops by the northern entrance on Chinbrook Road which London Buses 124, 126, 273 and school bus 638 serve.Transport for London bus mapTransport for London 638 bus times and route Grove Park centre is less than half a mile to the west of this entrance and is also served by these buses plus four more, 136, 181, 261 and night bus N136 as well as Grove Park railway station and the A2212 road.

The origin of the retinohypothalamic tract is the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC), which contain the photopigment melanopsin. The axons of the ipRGCs belonging to the retinohypothalamic tract project directly, monosynaptically, to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) via the optic nerve and the optic chiasm.from the retina to the optic chiasm, the ipRGC axons follow the same path as the axons of \\"regular\\" RGCs (i.e. RGCs that are not intrinsically photosensitive) The suprachiasmatic nuclei receive and interpret information on environmental light, dark and day length, important in the entrainment of the \\"body clock\\". They can coordinate peripheral \\"clocks\\" and direct the pineal gland to secrete the hormone melatonin. ==Structure== The retinohypothalamic tract consists of retinal ganglion cells.. A distinct population of ganglion cells, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is critically responsible for providing non-image-forming visual signals to the brain. Only about two percent of all retinal ganglion cells are ipRGCs, whose cell bodies are in mainly the ganglion cell layer (and some are displaced in the inner nuclear layer of the retina). The photopigment melanopsin is present on the dendrites of ipRGCs, giving ipRGCs sensitivity to light in the absence of rod or cone input. The dendrites spread outwards from ipRGCs within the inner plexiform layer. These dendrites can also receive more canonical signals from the rest of the neuroretina. These signals are then carried through the optic nerve, which projects to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), anterior hypothalamic area, retrochiasmatic area, and lateral hypothalamus. However, a major portion of the RHT ends in the SCN. ==NeurotransmittersGlutamate=== Glutamate levels in the RHT are measured by means of immunoreactivity. Retinal nerve terminals display a significantly higher content of glutamate immunoreactivity than the postsynaptic dendrites and non- retinal terminals. The higher immunoreactivity in terminals shows that is readily available before transmission and is used up as the electrical signals travel along the RHT. The synapse of glutamate to the SCN has been shown to cause phase shifts in circadian rhythms, discussed more in detail later. ===Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)=== Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is co-stored and co- transmitted with glutamate in retinal terminals. More than ninety percent of all RHT projecting fibers to the SCN store PACAP. White light induces activation of ganglion cells containing PACAP. This allows for the concentration in SCN to be lower during the day and higher at night because humans are exposed to light more during the day and are having greater optic nerve stimulation. ==Effect on circadian rhythms== Summary of pervasive effects of light The SCN of the hypothalamus contains an endogenous pacemaker that regulates circadian rhythms.Irwin, R. (2007). Calcium response to retinohypothalamic tract synaptic transmission in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons., The zeitgeber found to have the most profound effect on the SCN is light, which is the form of stimulation of which conversion is needed for it to be processed by the brain. Neurotransmitters that travel the RHT are responsible for delivering this message to other parts of the brain. If damage is done to this important pathway, alterations in circadian rhythms including phase shifts may occur. Studies done on rats show that even with severely degenerated photoreceptors (blind, no visible light perception), they have the ability to entrain to the light/dark cycle because they have intact RHTs., Hannibal (2002). A study was conducted to observe the differences in three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats: ones that had part of the RHT pathway cut when it was an adult (AE), ones that had part of the pathway cut within 24 hours of their birth (NE), and a control group.Stephan, F. K. (1978). Developmental plasticity in retinohypothalamic connections and the entrainment of circadian rhythms. Further development of the brains of those in the NE group showed that the two suprachaismatic nuclei (SCN) have nearly equal inputs shortly after the pathway is cut. This was shown to drastically slow down the re- synchronization of internal biological rhythms to the external time cues, primarily light. Rats in the AE and NE groups similarly reduced the amount of fluid intake during the study during the hours they were exposed to constant light. This may indicate that the intake of water is affected by the number of connections in this pathway and affect the further development of other parts of the brain that are dependent on light. ==References== Category:Eye Category:Sleep physiology Category:Circadian rhythm Category:Hypothalamus ","title":"Retinohypothalamic tract"},{"id":"9090262","text":"An open evangelical attempts to uphold evangelical doctrines, morality, and spirituality, while also being inclusive of others. It is a term which is commonly used in the United Kingdom in reference to both individuals and institutions. == Uses == Open evangelicals describe their position as combining a traditional evangelical emphasis on the nature of scriptural authority, the teaching of the ecumenical creeds and other traditional doctrinal teachings, with an approach towards culture and other theological points of view which tends to be more inclusive than that taken by other evangelicals. In the Church of England, Graham Kings contrasts open evangelicals from \\"conservative evangelicals\\" and \\"charismatic evangelicals.\\" Another Anglican, Martin Percy, contends that such a position is quite tenuous and, on divisive issues, either stands firm to a form of uncritical conservatism or risks being attacked as theological liberalism. The think tank Fulcrum and the periodical Anvil were established as fora for open evangelicals within the Church of England. Prominent advocates of the open evangelical position include N.T. Wright, Graham Kings, Steven Croft, and Justin Welby. Among Anglican theological colleges, open evangelicalism is particularly strong within Ridley Hall, Cambridge, Cranmer Hall, Durham, and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford.

Unhappy with country life, he moved to Shiba in Tokyo and attended Keio University Faculty of Arts. However, he spent more of his time in the Tokyo pleasure districts, such as Yoshiwara, rather than in the classroom. His first novel, Kotohime monogatari was based on personal experiences in the brothel district, and appeared in the literary magazine Chūōkōron in 1917. Its success led to his withdrawal from Keio University to start a career as a writer. ==Literary career== In 1923, Muramatsu moved to China, where he lived in the Shanghai International Settlement in an apartment run by émigré Russians. He was interested in Chinese culture, but while in Shanghai was exposed to many varieties of Western culture, due to the large numbers of French, British and Russian expatriates in his neighborhood. He also made the acquaintance of a number of young Chinese intellectuals, including Tian Han, Yu Dafu and Guo Moruo. In his 1924 novel Mato (“Demon City”, 1924), he portrayed the dichotomy of Shanghai – a modern, beautiful, civilized façade, hiding a darker side populated by all manner of criminals and vice. page 84 Muramatsu remained in China for several years, and was especially close to Guo Moruo, assisting him while in exile in Japan in 1928; however, the friendship was severed when Japan sent troops into China in response to the Jinan Incident. Although Muramatsu produced numerous works of romantic popular fiction, he is best known for his semi-historical biographical novels. His works include Shōden Shimizu Jirochō (1926–1928), about the famous 19th century gangster/folk-hero of the Tōkaidō. He also wrote several spy novels in the 1930s, glorifying the exploits of Yoshiko Kawashima in Manchuria. Some of the exaggerated fictional exploits created by Muramatsu were cited as “evidence” in Kawashima’s post-war trial, which led to her execution. Muramatsu also wrote Honchō gajin den (“Biography of an Imperial Court Painter”, 1940–1943), Kinsei Meishōden (“Biography of Contemporary Master Craftsmen”), and Kinsei meishōbu monogatari (1952–1961), which appeared serialized in newspapers. A number of novels were also made into movies in the early 1960s, such as Zangiku Monogatari (which appeared in movie form as \\"The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums\\") Muramatsu relocated from Tokyo to Kamakura in 1947 and lived there with his mistress to his death. Muramatsu was also a noted amateur master of the classical board game, go. He was also a noted cat lover, a passion which he shared with fellow author and Kamakura resident Jirō Osaragi. Muramatsu died in 1961, and his grave is at the temple of Kakuon-ji in Kamakura. His son, Muramatsu Takashi, won the Kikuchi Award, and his grandson Muramatsu Tomomi is a winner of the Naoki Award. ==See also== * Japanese literature * List of Japanese authors ==References== * Muramatsu, Ei.

The previous elections in 1998 saw significant violence and intimidation of opposition supporters. It took place a year after FUNCINPEC had been violently ousted from the coalition government by the Cambodian People's Party. However following the election they once more formed a coalition with Hun Sen as Prime Minister and FUNCINPEC's leader Prince Norodom Ranarridh, the son of King Norodom Sihanouk, as his deputy. In local elections in 2002 the Cambodian People's Party performed strongly leading in 1,597 of the 1,621 communes of Cambodia. Meanwhile, FUNCINPEC suffered a setback dropping to only 22% of the vote. ==Campaign== The run-up to the election saw some violence including the killing of a judge and a royalist politician, however it was much reduced from previous elections. During the campaign the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Cambodia, met all three main party leaders and called on all parties to have fair coverage in the media. The opposition were able to get some time on television during the campaign, but there were many reports in rural areas of voters being intimidated by the Cambodian People's Party. In total 22 parties contested the election but only three were seen as real contenders in the election. The Cambodian People's Party had control of much of the media in Cambodia, the most money and a superior party machine. The party campaigned on the economic development they said that they were bringing to Camdodia and in the March before the election they announced a 1.5 billion dollar program to counter poverty. The party and their leader Hun Sen won support from voters due to their presiding over the most peaceful period in the countries recent history after ending the rule of the Khmer Rouge. The party had the strongest support in rural areas of Cambodia, but younger voters in urban areas were more desirous of change and therefore supportive of the opposition. The two main opposition parties criticised the government of Hun Sen for its corruption and pledged to improve health and education in Cambodia. FUNCINPEC called for reform of the economy and for more foreign investment, but their leader, Norodom Ranariddh, was seen as being ineffective and his party's popularity was in decline. Meanwhile, the Sam Rainsy Party criticised corruption, pledged more money for health, education and civil servant pay and attempted to attract the poor. The party had grown in strength since the previous election but their leader Sam Rainsy was seen as being authoritarian. ==Results== Voter turnout in the election was high with over 80% casting ballots. The results saw the Cambodian People's Party win a clear majority of seats but fell short of the two-thirds majority required in order to elect a Prime Minister on their own. FUNCINPEC lost ground dropping from the 31% they had won in 1998 to only just over 20% this time, while the Sam Rainsy Party rose to 22% from 14% in 1998. ==Aftermath== Following the election, FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party refused to attend parliament and formed an \\"Alliance of Democrats\\" in order to block Hun Sen from being elected Prime Minister again. They rejected the official results and said that they had been manipulated by the Cambodian People's Party. After initially boycotting parliament the two parties were persuaded by the King to attend the swearing in at the end of September, but remained firm in rejecting joining a government led by Hun Sen. However, despite no government being formed, a caretaker administration run by Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party was able to continue. A provisional agreement was said to have been reached in November on a three party government led by Hun Sen but the opposition later denied this. Personal dislike between the three parties and the opposition of the Cambodia People's Party to a three party government meant negotiations on forming a government dragged on into 2004. Eventually, 11 months after the election, towards the end of June 2004 the Cambodia People's Party and FUNCINPEC reached an agreement under which ministerial seats would be divided up 60-40 between them and Hun Sen would remain Prime Minister. On the 15 July 2004 the Cambodian parliament finally approved the new government with 96 of the 123 members voting in favour. There was a significant increase in the number of ministers to 207, including 7 deputy prime ministers and 180 cabinet ministers, in order to reach agreement on the new government. ==Literature== * ==References== Cambodia Parliamentary election Category:Elections in Cambodia Category:Parliament of Cambodia ","title":"2003 Cambodian general election"},{"id":"9090360","text":"VS1 may refer to: *VS1, a V speed in aviation *VS1, a grade of Diamond clarity *OS/VS1, an operating system ","title":"VS1"},{"id":"9090396","text":"Tally Hall is an American rock band formed in December 2002 and based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The band has a cult following, and is known for upbeat melodies and whimsical lyrics. The members used to describe their musical style as \\"wonky rock,\\" later changed to \\"fabloo,\\" in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres.MTV interview with Tally Hall, where Cantor described the band's dropping of the \\"wonky rock\\" genre in favor of a less-restrictive title. Tally Hall has five members, distinguished by the color of their neckties: vocalist and guitarist Rob Cantor (yellow), drummer Ross Federman (gray), vocalist and guitarist Joe Hawley (red), vocalist and keyboardist Andrew Horowitz (green), and vocalist and bassist Zubin Sedghi (blue). Once under the Atlantic Records recording label, Tally Hall was, again, signed to indie label Quack!Media,Tally Hall announced the release date of Good & Evil under Quack who previously helped finance and nationally distribute their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. They released their second album, Good & Evil, on June 21, 2011. Tally Hall also provided the vocals and music for all of the songs in Happy Monster Band, a children's television series that aired on Playhouse Disney. == History Early years=== Horowitz, the only member not originally from Michigan, began writing songs when he was eight years old, and attended the University of Michigan, studying composition. There he met Cantor, who had both attended high school with Sedghi and joined Hawley's film production group. When Tally Hall's original drummer, Steve Gallagher, left the band in 2004, they recruited Federman, who had gone to high school with Hawley. The name \\"Tally Hall\\" comes from its use as the name of an indoor shopping plaza on Orchard Lake Road in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, the arcade whose name shares the title of their debut album, remains there, though the shopping center has changed names. In 2005, the band released their debut studio album, Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum. Violinist Jeremy Kittel contributed strings to the album. The band has received national media attention, performing their song \\"Good Day\\" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on August 2, 2006, as well as appearing in MTV's segment You Hear It First in September 2006. The band appeared at the 2007 South by Southwest Music Festival. On August 3, 2008, Tally Hall was a performer on the BMI stage at Lollapalooza. Tally Hall was invited back by The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on September 16, 2008, to help promote the launch of Tally Hall's Internet Show. They performed \\"Welcome to Tally Hall\\" in newly donned black vests over top of their traditional colored ties, white shirts, and black pants. The band worked on several projects after the completion of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, including covering the song \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" by The Killers for the sixth The O.C. soundtrack: Music from the OC: Mix 6. The band re-released Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum on April 1, 2008, with their new record label, Atlantic Records after some re-recording and re- mixing. ===Tours and Good & Evil=== On September 9, 2009, Hidden in the Sand (HITS), a prominent Tally Hall fan site, broke the news that Tally Hall was going to release a collaborative song, featuring Nellie McKay, which would be released as a free download from mp3.walmart.com when customers of Walmart purchased a book called The Magician's Elephant by Kate DiCamillo.HITS The book had been made available for purchase earlier that day. The same day, HITS reported the title of the song, \\"Light & Night\\", along with a short audio clip of it in another update. In their 2010 March tour with Jukebox the Ghost and Skybox, it was reported that Joe Hawley had unexpectedly backed out of the tour. Hawley was replaced with Casey Shea, who wore a black tie. On March 25, 2011, the band announced that all five original band members were still together. The band was managed by The Hornblow Group, who also manages They Might Be Giants, OK Go, and Oppenheimer, until 2010, when Tally Hall changed management to Stiletto Entertainment, who manages Barry Manilow, in addition to several other solo performance acts. With the release of Good & Evil, Tally Hall returned to their original label, Quack!Media. After the release of Good & Evil, the band became inactive, and all of its members went on to more or less independent endeavors. As of 2020, the band has been on an indefinite hiatus. ===Post-Good & Evil=== Horowitz, under the moniker \\"edu\\", released a solo album called sketches in 2012. He also was involved in production and piano on John Legend's Love in the Future. Hawley returned to school, but released an album, Hawaii: Part II, as part of his musical side project ミラクルミュージカル (Miracle Musical). He collaborated with Tally Hall members Sedghi, Federman, and Cantor on the album. Hawley later released Hawaii: Part II: Part ii, a compilation of outtakes, demos, and instrumentals of the original album, as well as Hawaii Partii, a collection of songs from the game Labyrinth, based on the music video for the Hawaii: Part II song of the same name. The track titled Labyrinth (also commonly known as See How I Circle) featured a collaboration with pop singer Charlene Kaye.Hidden in the sand2019 album of the yearHawaii II reviewLast FM Federman has made occasional appearances as producer, percussionist, and DJ with the pseudonym \\"Mr. F\\", although his main focus has been school. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a 4.0 science GPA, and has just recently graduated from Yale University with a Ph. D in Immunology. Sedghi, aside from appearing in Hawaii: Part II, has simply stayed in school. As of 2020, Horowitz stated during his Instagram livestream Keep Up the Good Work: > So Zubin, correct me if I'm wrong, but he's on the frontline right now, > working at a hospital. Well, last we heard, he was like, he was quarantined > for, he couldn't... they thought he might be sick, so he was in [quarantine] > for two weeks, then he went back to work in the hospital, and, as far as I > know, he's working. Cantor released his solo album, Not a Trampoline, on April 14, 2014. In addition, he has made several viral videos on YouTube, including \\"SHIA LABEOUF\\" and \\"29 Celebrity Impressions, 1 Original Song - Rob Cantor\\". He also records songs for Disney Junior Musical Nursery Rhymes. In 2015 Tally Hall's Bandcamp page was updated with a demo LP titled “Admittedly Incomplete Demos”, In reference to their earlier “Complete Demos”. This LP included demos for songs from Good & Evil as well as demos for unreleased songs, live performances, and studio versions of covers such as Just A Friend and The Minstrel Boy. In mid-2016, Hawley announced a comedy hip-hop album Joe Hawley Joe Hawley, which was released October of that year. In 2019, Hawley's γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ γɘlwɒH ɘoႱ, a reversed version of the album, was released. This was due to the large amounts of sampling he used, and to avoid copyright. In 2018, Horowitz released studio versions of piano compositions written in 2003 for the album etudes. In April 2019, Horowitz released studio versions of piano compositions written in 2005 while he was a student at Michigan university for the album etudes II. In August 2019, the band released their archived cover of Biz Markie's \\"Just a Friend\\" , which was originally only found on their album \\"Admittedly Incomplete Demos\\". In May 2020, Horowitz started a weekly Instagram livestream series titled Keep Up The Good Work, where he has one or two guests on each stream. Some of these guests have included fellow members Federman and Sedghi. == Videos == In addition to music, the band has also created numerous movies. These movies include both music videos and humorous skits. The best known of these videos is the music video for \\"Banana Man\\", which resulted in significant publicity among online users visiting the website Albino Blacksheep, along with \\"The Bidding\\", another popular title by the group. Corresponding with their single \\"Good Day\\", released on February 26, 2008, the band released a music video for the song on YouTube. In August 2008, the band performed a three-song live video set for LiveDaily Sessions, including the songs \\"Good Day\\", \\"Be Born\\", and \\"Greener\\", which premiered on August 28, 2008. They have appeared on Fearless Music several times, playing songs such as \\"Be Born\\", \\"Ruler of Everything\\", \\"Misery Fell\\", \\"Good Day\\", and \\"Banana Man\\". These recordings can be found on YouTube. In July 2014, band member Rob Cantor released a video in which he seemed to perform his song \\"Perfect\\" by singing spot-on impressions of 29 celebrities. In the video, Cantor is accompanied by another band member, Andrew Horowitz, on piano and backing vocals. The video received more than 7,000,000 hits in 10 days. Shortly thereafter, Cantor revealed the video to be an elaborate hoax. ===Tally Hall's Internet Show and music videos=== Taking on an even larger role within the band's video portfolio was the ten part bi-weekly variety-show series Tally Hall's Internet Show (T.H.I.S.), which debuted on September 15, 2008. Each episode ran 10 minutes long and was posted on their website. The content primarily included comedy sketches and music videos. With the release of Tally Hall's Internet Show in September 2008, it became clear that many music videos would be released within the Internet Show. \\"Good Day\\" was the first music video to be seen in episode one. Other music videos include \\"Dream\\", \\"Greener\\", \\"Hidden in the Sand\\", \\"Ruler of Everything\\", \\"Taken for a Ride\\", \\"The Whole World and You\\", \\"Two Wuv\\", and \\"Welcome to Tally Hall\\".

The RHPPC is equivalent to the commercial PowerPC 603e processor with the minor exceptions of the phase locked loop (PLL) and the processor version register (PVR). The RHPPC processor is compatible with the PowerPC architecture (Book I-III), the PowerPC 603e programmers interface and is also supported by common PowerPC software tools and embedded operating systems, like VxWorks. == Technical details == The RHPPC processor generates 190 MIPS with the Dhrystone mix with its core clock at 100 MHz (i.e. the RHPPC processor completes 1.9 instructions per cycle). The RHPPC runs with a 25, 33.3, 40, or 50 MHz 60x bus clock (SYSCLK) which is generated based on the PCI clock. The 60x bus clock is de-skewed on-chip by a PLL and can also be multiplied. The RHPPC processor is a superscalar machine with five execution units: system register unit, integer unit, load/store unit, floating point unit, and branch processing unit. The dispatch unit can issue two instructions per cycle. The floating point unit has a three level deep pipeline. Out of order execution is supported through the use of shadow or rename registers. The completion unit can complete two instructions per cycle in order by copying results from the rename registers to the real registers. Independently, the branch processing unit can complete a branch each cycle. Thus, in theory, the RHPPC processor can complete three instructions per cycle. Within the RHPPC processor there is a 16 kB instruction and a 16 kB data L1 caches that are 4 way set associative, and support write through or copy-back protocol. A cache line is fixed at eight words. == Fabrication process and packaging == The RHPPC processor is fabricated with Honeywell’s SOI-V 0.35 µm, four level metal process. Standard cells and custom drop-ins are used. It is packaged in a hermetic, aluminium oxide, 21 x 21 mm grid array package with 255 (16 x 16) leads. The leads are on 1.27 mm centers. The lead can have either solder balls, solder columns, or short pins attached.

The school, founded in 1893, was the oldest operating boarding academy of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It was a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average – across all demographics.\\" ==History== The oldest boarding academy of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Mount Vernon Academy opened its doors in 1893 to 32 students and six staff members with Professor William T. Bland as principal. By the end of the first year the enrollment had grown to about 100. The school opened in buildings previously occupied by the Mount Vernon Sanitarium, which had closed in 1891. Ellen G. White, when consulted, had written in 1893: \\"Let the building be converted into a seminary to educate our youth in the place of enlarging the college at Battle Creek. I have been shown that there should...be located, school buildings in Ohio which would give character to the work\\" (Ellen G. White letter K35). The day after this letter was written, J. N. Loughborough submitted a report to the General Conference in session advising the same action. Upon General Conference recommendations, the stockholders of the sanitarium voted to adopt this recommendation and to form a new corporation for the management of the Academy. After operating on the secondary level for 12 years, the school was advanced from an academy to a college. During the next 11 years, Mount Vernon College offered four-year courses leading to B.S. and B.A. degrees. Secondary work also continued during this time. Norris W. Lawrence served as the first president of the college. In 1914 the Washington Foreign Mission Seminary at Washington, D.C. (now known as Washington Adventist University), was made the training college for the Columbia Union, and the school at Mount Vernon reverted to an academy. The Administration Building was built in 1924 and housed the chapel, three classrooms, and the administrative offices. On December 24, 1926, the old sanitarium building, which was the main campus building for many years, was destroyed by fire. A partial replacement, Linden Hall, the girls' dormitory, was erected in 1927-1928. In 1940, Hadley Hall, the boys' dormitory, was built, along with additions built onto the Linden Hall. The gymnasium was completed in 1951, and in 1958, the industrial arts building. In 1968, Hiawatha Hall, which included the cafeteria, classrooms, and administrative offices, was built. Campus-wide renovations began in 2001, which included redecoration and repairs to the Cafeteria, renovating Linden Hall and Hadley Hall, renovations to the Music Building, a new Campus Center, and repairs on the gymnasium. Over $3.6 million was invested in capital improvements since 2001. Over 7,000 students attended the school during its operation. ===Closing=== In October, 2014 it was revealed the school had been severely mismanaging its finances and could not continue to operate. The academy was given 2 months to raise $3 million or shut down. Despite appeals on social media by the principal and the students under the #dosomething campaign, the fundraiser was a failure. Preparations were made for the closure and a scholarship was established to help students continue Adventist education if they so wished. Mount Vernon Academy ceased operations in June, 2015. The property which had 13 buildings across 24 acres plus 227 acres of recreational land, was sold at auction to multiple parties on June 22, 2016 for a total of $1.595 million. Ohio conference president Ron Halvorsen Jr. stated the funds raised would be used to pay some of the academy's outstanding debts and establish an education scholarship. ==Academics== Mount Vernon Academy places a high value on the rigors of academics. Block Class Schedules, integrated use of technology, a highly qualified faculty with 72% holding master's degrees, and a Dual Credit Program provide motivated students with great academic opportunities. ==Spiritual aspects== All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. ==Athletics== Mount Vernon Academy fielded 4 sports teams in 3 sports. In past years, the school had fielded other athletic teams. The school was accredited by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. ===AcroNics=== The AcroNics wae the co-ed gymnastics team of Mount Vernon Academy. Although they were not involved in any type of competition, the AcroNics regularly attended the annual Acrofest held at Highland Academy. The AcroNics have also performed at Quicken Loans Arena during Primetime at Cleveland Cavaliers games in 2013 and 2014. ===Bill Jarvis Invitational=== The Bill Jarvis Invitational, which started in 2010, is an annual soccer and volleyball tournament held by Mount Vernon Academy every September.

He was a member of the Romanian Academy. ==Biography== Born in Szelistye (now Săliște, Transylvania, at the time part of Austria-Hungary), Lupaş attended between 1886 and 1891 the primary school in his home village. In 1892 he started attending the State School in Nagyszeben (Sibiu), but, due to a conflict on national topics with his history teacher Árpád Trompa, he was forced to move (together with his colleague Octavian Goga) to the Andrei Șaguna Orthodox School in Brassó (Braşov), from where he graduated in 1900. He studied Philosophy and Literature at the University of Budapest on a \\"Gojdu Foundation\\" scholarship, graduating in 1904, and received his PhD from the University of Berlin (1905) with the thesis The Romanian Orthodox Church in Transylvania and the Communion with Rome in the 18th Century. Between 1905 and 1909, Lupaş taught Church History and Romanian History at the \\"Andreian\\" Institute of Theology in Sibiu and attended Theology courses. During his studies he made his debut in journalism and co-founded the Romanian-language Luceafărul magazine. In November 1907, Lupaş was brought to trial for seditious libel, being accused of having instigated the peasants to hatred against the landowners, and sentenced to three months imprisonment and a 200 Krone-fine. He served his three month-sentence in Szeged between August and October 1908, forced out of the Institute in 1909, and appointed priest to the Sălişte parish. The Romanian Academy elected him an associate member in 1914 and full member in 1916, at Nicolae Iorga's suggestion. However, due to the war, he managed to deliver his acceptance speech before the Academy on 8 June 1920. After Romania's entry in World War I on the Allied side, Lupaş was exiled to Sopron County (western Hungary) and placed under house arrest. In 1918, he was elected representative for Sălişte in the Transylvanian National Assembly that declared the Union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania. Starting with 1919 he became professor at the University of Cluj, teaching Modern History and Transylvanian History until 1946, and in 1920, together with Alexandru Lapedatu, co-founded the National History Institute, located also in Cluj; he also taught Church History at the Theological Academy. Lupaş was elected president of the History Section of ASTRA and, between 1932 and 1935, president of the History Section of the Romanian Academy. In the interwar period, Ioan Lupaş served in the Chamber of Deputies for several mandates, and as Minister of Health and Social Security in the Alexandru Averescu cabinet (1926–1927), as well as Minister of Culture and Arts in the Octavian Goga cabinet (1937 – 1938). Due to his political activity, he was arrested by the communist regime on 5 May 1950 and detained at Sighet prison until 5 May 1955. Lupaș died on 3 July 1867 and he was buried at the Cernica Monastery. ==Works== *Câteva pagini din trecutul comunei Sălişte *Schiţă istorică, Sibiu, 1903 *Şovinismul confesional în istoriografia românească ardeleană.

The club ran for 60 years until the loss of the sudden loss of their financial backing in 1987. ==History== Portals Athletic FC were founded in 1927 as the works side of the Laverstoke Paper Mill, and initially played in the local Basingstoke League where they enjoyed plenty of success - most notably in 1936–37 when they won the Hampshire Junior 'A' Cup. In 1967 Portals were elected to Hampshire League Division 3 where they finished in a respectable mid-table final position. A year later the league was expanded and they were consequently placed in Division 3 West, where they finished 3rd before clinching promotion as runners-up in 1969–70. Portals quickly adapted well to life in what was then a highly competitive Division 2 and clinched a final position of 3rd which was enough to secure a second successive promotion. Life in the top flight was tough for Portals and they were relegated straight back again to Division 2 where they remained until the 1983–84 season when they bounced back as champions. Portals enjoyed numerous cup successes during this period and quickly consolidated themselves in Division 1 for two seasons until in 1986 they (along with the league's top clubs with the required facilities) broke away to form the new Wessex League.http://www.fchd.info/PORTALSA.HTM In the league's inaugural season Portals finished in a steady 12th position but in 1987 the parent company suddenly withdrew their support, forcing the club to sadly withdraw from the competition and disband just after celebrating their 60th anniversary. Another sad loss to non-league football. The Portals ground at Laverstoke Park, located alongside the B3400 between Whitchurch and Overton, remained in use after the clubs untimely demise. During the 1999–2000 season it was leased to the short-lived Hampshire League side AFC Basingstoke. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1983/84 *Hampshire League Division 3 West **Runners-up 1969/70 *Hampshire FA Intermediate Cup **Winners 1939/40 and 1980/81 *Hampshire FA Junior 'A' Cup **Winners 1936/37 *North Hants Senior Cup **Winners 1979/80, 1980/81 and 1982/83 *North Hants May Cup **Winners 1947/48 ==Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events - 1967/68Hampshire League Division 310/16 - 1968/69Hampshire League Division 3 West3/14 - 1969/70Hampshire League Division 3 West2/14Runners-up, Promoted - 1970/71Hampshire League Division 23/16Promoted - 1971/72Hampshire League Division 115/16Relegated - 1972/73Hampshire League Division 210/16 - 1973/74Hampshire League Division 213/16 - 1974/75Hampshire League Division 210/16 - 1975/76Hampshire League Division 27/16 - 1976/77Hampshire League Division 211/16 - 1977/78Hampshire League Division 28/16 - 1978/79Hampshire League Division 28/16 - 1979/80Hampshire League Division 28/16 - 1980/81Hampshire League Division 23/20 - 1981/82Hampshire League Division 24/20 - 1982/83Hampshire League Division 24/20 - 1983/84Hampshire League Division 21/18Champions, Promoted - 1984/85Hampshire League Division 117/20 - 1985/86Hampshire League Division 18/20Left competition - 1986/87Wessex League 12/17Left competition } ==Famous Players== In the early fifties, locally born Brian Clifton played for Portals before enjoying a long professional career with Southampton and Grimsby Town.

She taught school while studying art. She then taught drawing and painting for two years in Plainfield, New Jersey.New International Encyclopedia Her first poem was published when she was 16 years old in a Salem newspaper. Three years later she published her first book, but it was not until 1893 that she obtained her first success with her stories. Front cover of Bonnie Bairns (1889) by Ida Waugh In 1888 she published her first book, and the first collaboration with Ida Waugh, Bonny Bairns, with the Worthington & Co. firm of New York. In this book the usual order was reversed, and the pictures were illustrated with verses. The combination was not only pleasant but pretty. The lithographs were beautifully executed and did full justice to the drawings, which were of a much higher quality than usually appeared in children's picture books. The verses that accompanied them made a pleasant jingle with just sense enough to make them attractive to the chubby critic. ==Personal life== Amy Ella Blanchard was a lifelong companion of her artist collaborator Ida Waugh (1846-1919). They met when Waugh was still living with her parents and Blanchard was hired as tutor of Waugh's younger brother, future painter Frederick Judd Waugh. They lived together in Philadelphia and New York City, their homes a gathering place for authors. In 1906 Blanchard moved to Washington, D.C. where she lived at 1080 31st Street, N.W. During this period she became a popular writer of girls' books. Blanchard and Waugh had neighboring summer cottages at Bailey Island, Maine where they helped organize the construction of a chapel in 1916.John R.

She died on July 4, 1926, at Bailey Island from apoplexy; she was found by her maid at the desk, a just complete poem forecasting her own death in front of her.

The district center is the town of Lal wa Sarjangal. The population of 250,000 is exclusively Hazara. However other sources suggest the population exceeds 250,000 individuals.http://abouzarlali.blogfa.com/ ==Early history== The early history of the district is clouded in myths and folklore including stories of how the Hazaras of southern Hazarastan took control of this Aimaq-inhabited province. However, the regions now known as Lal, Sar Jangal and Kirman have been documented in historic books. Ghobar states Lal & Kirman as the grazing land for the horses of Mongol army under the great conqueror Genghis Khan. Traditionally, in the feudal Hazara society prior to the 1880-1890 massacre of the hazaras, Lal and Sar Jangal was part of the Greater Daizangi region ruled in parts by feudal chiefs known as Mirs and Baigs. The country's grazing land had historically proven to be useful for maintaining large armies by the Mirs. Prominent Mirs of the old days include Nauroz Baig and Yusuf Baig who hold considerable respect in the local folklore. ==20th century== During the period that followed the genocide by Abdul Rahman and the failure of state following assassination of Nadir Khan, the hazara elite came to an uneasy settlement with the Kabul government. District governors almost always Pashtun were appointed by the central government who governed the area with the help of government-appointed arbabs like in most parts of the country. Over this period, the district oversaw the rise of many feudal chiefs turned politicians. This period was a harsh time for the hazaras, but the people of Lal with hard work and dedication survived through this phase and by the 1970s, the district had a reputation in the hazara community for large number of intellectuals, university graduates and prominent personalities. Towering figures of this period included Member of Parliament Khadim Hussain Baig, Haji Sarwar and Haji Sayed Akbar. Similarly, local politicians of prominence well- respected by the people included names such as Kalbi Reza Baig, Sayed Nasir La'li, Mir Mohammad Amir Baig, Arbab Nadir Shah and other local leaders. The La'l elite proved to be well-respected because of their piety and understanding of the people's needs. ==Communism and Lali educated elite== Lal Sar Jangal was a vibrantly changing and progressive society right before the revolution that struck in 1978. The district's educated elite however were generally massacred by the communist regime of Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafeezullah Amin, mostly under the allegation of being Maoists. Prominent student leaders from the district included Aziz Tughian and Mohammad Ranjbar. On the other hand, the PDPA members from Lal Sar Jangal were also prominent and overwhelmingly successful. The first district governor of the Lal Sar Jangal from the local Hazara population was Ewaz Ali who was later on brutally murdered by members of the Mujahideen faction. The period of the PDPA rise also trained a number of talent Lal youth that later on took important positions in the Afghan government. Names such as General Murad Ali Murad commander of Afghanistan's ground forces and Mohammad Hussain Gharjistani the chief of staff of Vice Presidential office are part of a large number of officers and cadre coming from the province. ==Mujahideen and the establishment of Hizb-e-wahdat== Lal Sar Jangal from 1979 to 2001 was controlled by the new rising Jihadi organisations mostly linked with Iran. These organisations have mixed reputation for engaging the people in local civil wars and imposing different sorts of illegal taxes. However, the shining point of the Jihadi organisations for Lal Sar Jangal was the establishment and unification of these local parties in 1988 under the banner of Hezb-e-wahdat. This party was formed by the hard-fought struggle of a respectable Mujahid leader Sayed Abdul Hameed Sajjadi. The first convention of unity was signed by all leaders of the hazara resistance in Lal including Mohammad Mohaqqiq who represented the Northern Hazaras led by late Abdul Ali Mazari. ==Post 2001== Lal never fell to the Taliban. It continued to be a hub of resistance throughout the national resistance against the Taliban. Unlike most other districts, the people of Lal continued to harbour anti-Taliban resistance. With the fall of Taliban, the old rivalries of the two Hezb-e-Wahdat factions i.e. Akbari and Khalili continued to haunt the district. Even until today, the politics of the district is controlled by these Jihadi parties. A new elite of youth is on rise with prominent presence in universities both inside and outside Afghanistan. High schools are packed with students and women have an active role in the reconstruction of the district. In common with other mountainous districts, Lal Wa Sarjangal suffers from low rainfall and severe and long winters, both of which affect agriculture, the most important source of income. Very less attention is paid in the education system at the district therefore most basic elements are not provided for the students such as proper school buildings, furniture schools books etc... ==Prominent personalities== * General Murad Ali Murad, commander of Afghan National Army Infantry * Hassan Abdullahi Minister of Urban Development * Qurban Kohistani, Member of Parliament * Nadir Shah Bahr, Member of Parliament * Ruqia Nayel, Member of Parliament * Haidar Ali Etimadi, Leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat faction * Jafar Mahdawi, Member of Parliament and leader of Mellat Party of Afghanistan * Asad Buda, Anthropologist and Writer * Zahra Hossainzada, poet * Ali Aalimi Kermani, University professor, Writer and Translator == Health == There are 11 health centers in Lal wa Sar e Jangal district. it's consist of Lal district health center, Safid-Ab, Daimirdad, Khame-e-Shur, Qala-e-Pechi, Kerman, Talkhak and Garmab basic health centers, Ghighanace health sub-center, Afghan red crescent society health center in Talkhak valley and LEPCO special health clinic for the treat of Tubercles and Leprosy patients. All of the health centers are funded by the MoPH through implementing Afghan NGOs which significantly provides poor health services, except ARCS and LAPCO clinics that's funded by national and international organizations. Luck of qualified medical doctors, specialists, obstetricians and medical technicians are a big challenge for provision of health services to the community. Bad quality of road, isolation of district from capital city and center of the province, unqualified medical staff, lack of proper training for the existing staff and lack of interests of medical staff to come for work from outside Lal wa Sar e Jangal adds to challenges and health problems. The mothers and children mortality rate is high in this province due to lack of proper maternal health, post-natal and ante-natal care, bad roads creates problem to get easy access to the health facilities and also low level of knowledge of the existing health staff. Acute respiratory infections and other respiratory diseases are common in the winter time and Acute Castro Enteritis is common in the summer time due to lack of access to the clean drinking water.

In this article, Permutt suggests \\"The pressure in the pulmonary arteries and veins is less at the top than at the bottom of the lung. It is quite likely that there is a portion of the lung toward the top in an upright subject in which the pressure in the pulmonary arteries is less than alveolar pressure.\\" The concept is as follows: Alveolar pressure (PA) at end expiration is equal to atmospheric pressure (0 cm H20 differential pressure, at zero flow), plus or minus 2 cm H2O (1.5 mmHg) throughout the lung. On the other hand, gravity causes a gradient in blood pressure between the top and bottom of the lung of 20 mmHg in the erect position (roughly half of that in the supine position). Overall, mean pulmonary venous pressure is ~5 mmHg. Local venous pressure falls to -5 at the apexes and rises to +15 mmHg at the bases, again for the erect lung. Pulmonary blood pressure is typically in the range 25–10 mmHg with a mean pressure of 15 mmHg. Regional arterial blood pressure is typically in the range 5 mmHg near the apex of the lung to 25 mmHg at the base. Zone 1 is not observed in the normal healthy human lung. In normal health pulmonary arterial (Pa) pressure exceeds alveolar pressure (PA) in all parts of the lung. It is generally only observed when a person is ventilated with positive pressure or hemorrhage. In these circumstances, blood vessels can become completely collapsed by alveolar pressure (PA) and blood does not flow through these regions. They become alveolar dead space Zone 2 is the part of the lungs about 3 cm above the heart. In this region blood flows in pulses. At first there is no flow because of obstruction at the venous end of the capillary bed. Pressure from the arterial side builds up until it exceeds alveolar pressure and flow resumes. This dissipates the capillary pressure and returns to the start of the cycle. Flow here is sometimes compared to a starling resistor or waterfall effect. Zone 3 comprises the majority of the lungs in health. There is no external resistance to blood flow and blood flow is continuous throughout the cardiac cycle. Flow is determined by the Ppa-Ppv difference (Ppa - Ppv), which is constant down this portion of the lung. However, transmural pressure across the wall of the blood vessels increases down this zone due to gravity. Consequently the vessels wall are more stretched so the caliber of the vessels increases causing an increase in flow due to lower resistance. Zone 4 can be seen at the lung bases at low lung volumes or in pulmonary edema. Pulmonary interstitial pressure (Pi) rises as lung volume decreases due to reduced radial tethering of the lung parenchyma. Pi is highest at the base of the lung due to the weight of the above lung tissue. Pi can also rise due to an increased volume of 'leaked' fluid from the pulmonary vasculature (pulmonary edema). An increase in Pi causes extraalveolar blood vessels to reduce in caliber, in turn causing blood flow to decrease (extraalveolar blood vessels are those blood vessels outside alveoli). Intraalveolar blood vessels (pulmonary capillaries) are thin walled vessels adjacent to alveoli which are subject to the pressure changes described by zones 1-3. Flow in zone 4 is governed by the arteriointerstitial pressure difference (Pa − Pi). This is because as Pi rises, the arterial caliber is reduced, thereby increasing resistance to flow. The Pa/Pv difference remains unchanged since Pi is applied over both vessels. The ventilation/perfusion ratio is higher in zone #1 (the apex of lung) when a person is standing than it is in zone #3 (the base of lung) because perfusion is nearly absent. However, ventilation and perfusion are highest in base of the lung, resulting in a comparatively lower V/Q ratio. ==References== ==External links== * Description at anaesthetist.com * Animated diagram at sites.fasthosts.com Category:Respiratory physiology ","title":"Zones of the lung"},{"id":"9090575","text":"200px Con la música en el alma (English language:With the Music in my Soul) is a 1951 Argentine musical film directed by Luis Bayón Herrera and written by Carlos A.

Hopton Castle featured in the British TV series Time Team in 2010. A ruin since the early 18th century, it was partially restored between 2006 and 2011, and was officially re-opened to the public as a visitor attraction in December 2011 by the Duke of Gloucester. ==Norman Castle== It would seem likely that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey by one of the Hoptons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle. It's very possible that Walter de Hopton built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s. The bailey was fortified in stone and an impressive rectangular two-storey keep was built. The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle. From them it passed to Sir Henry Wallop when he married Elizabeth Corbet, daughter of Robert Corbet.Augusta Brickdale Corbet, The Family of Corbet, Its Life and Times, p.239. He fortified it as a parliamentary stronghold at the outbreak of the English Civil War but died before he could take part in the conflict, leaving it to his son, Robert Wallop, the regicide. ==Civil War siege, assault and massacre== During the Civil War Hopton Castle was one of the few castles to be held for the Parliament in the west. In 1644 Sir Michael Woodhouse, with a force of about 500, laid siege to the castle which was defended by about thirty Roundheads under the command of Samuel More. More eventually agreed terms and surrendered. There are varying versions of what happened next. According to More's account all those who surrendered, apart from himself, were killed and buried. Other accounts vary on how the siege ended. They state that after a three-week siege, More delayed surrendering until the bailey had been taken and the entrance to the keep was on fire, at which point the garrison surrendered to Sir Michael Woodhouse, who at his discretion (his prerogative under the laws of war as they were practised at that time), decided not to grant the majority of his prisoners quarter and they were killed by their captors. The castle was still habitable in 1700 but fell into disrepair soon afterwards. Substantial remnants of the much altered keep remain. ==RestorationHopton Castle Preservation Trust=== Another view of the castle In November 2008 the Hopton Castle Preservation Trust (founded in 2006) took ownership of the castle. The trust recently raised one million pounds, half of which was a grant from the National Lottery to fund conservation work and secure a future for the site. (See conservation and repair). ===Time Team=== The castle was the subject of a Time Team excavation and episode, appearing in series 17 of the long-running archaeology television programme, as episode 6 (\\"The Massacre in the Cellar\\") of that series, and broadcast on Channel 4 on 16 May 2010. The remaining castle keep was excavated over three days by Time Team, clarifying the shape of the castle and the history of its construction. The keep had been captured by the Royalists during the English Civil War. No evidence of a massacre was found. Time Team had previously excavated and filmed at High Ercall, another Civil War site in Shropshire. ===Conservation and repair=== The conservation and repair of the ruin, funded principally by The Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage was the culmination of many years of campaigning and fund raising on the part of the new owners, The Hopton Castle Preservation Trust. The works entailed significant structural stabilisation and rebuilding of the masonry and conservation of surviving medieval plaster. During this time a sophisticated and possibly unique garderobe chamber was revealed. As a result of evidence discovered within this chamber it is now believed that a siege breach may have taken place here.

For many years the island was connected via a peninsula to Gardiners Island. It is under the jurisdiction of East Hampton. In 1851 the federal government purchased on the peninsula from the Gardiners for $400Eastendlighthouses.com profile with the Gardiners Point Light first being lit in 1855 after a construction expenditure of $7,000. A March 1888 Nor'easter, referred to as the Great Blizzard of 1888, caused a break in the peninsula permanently turning the point into an island. Between 1890 and 1893 the island was shrinking at the rate of 10 feet per year. During the Spanish–American War the War Department recommended and Congress appropriated $500,000 to build Fort Tyler on the island as part of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. A temporary battery was constructed as an interim measure at a cost of $77,100. This battery consisted of emplacements for two 8-inch M1888 guns on converted carriages for 1870s-era Rodman guns. It was one of a number of batteries built shortly after the outbreak of the war, as it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. The \\"Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain\\" states the platforms were ready, but does not state that the guns were mounted.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778–3780, Washington: Government Printing Office There are two stories as to who the permanent fort was named for. One source states it was named for Daniel Tyler, a general and Civil War veteran who died in 1882, in General Order 194 of 27 December 1904.Fort Tyler at FortWiki.com Another story is that it was named for former President John Tyler (1841-1845) who married Julia Gardiner Tyler, born on Gardiners Island. The permanent fort consisted of Battery Edmund Smith, with emplacements for two 8-inch M1888 disappearing guns and two 5-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts.Berhow, p. 208Fort Tyler at the New York State Military Museum Records indicate that it was never armed. The fort was unusual in that it seems to have arisen entirely out of wartime fears. Most forts of its era were started based on recommendations of the 1885 Board of Fortifications and were already under construction (though years from completion) when war broke out. Thus, in most cases the temporary batteries were to quickly provide some armament for pre-existing forts. The shifting sands caused continuing problems for the fort, and it was abandoned in 1924 and transferred to the state as part of a post-World War I drawdown of coast defenses. In 1938 the island was declared a National Bird Refuge by Franklin Roosevelt and transferred to the Agriculture Department.Two Island Refuges Established During World War II the fort was used for bombing practice and this, combined with erosion, reduced it to its present state where it is popularly called \\"The Ruins.\\" In September 1971 Otis G. Pike put forward a bill that the US Federal government expropriate Gardiners Point Island, historic Gardiners Island, Cartwright Island, Hicks Island and 1000 acres of the nearby shore of Long Island, and turn them into a national monument. The state of New York briefly considered turning it into a park but it is deemed a navigational hazard because of the possibilities of unexploded ordnance.

Processes such as fluorescence and phosphorescence are examples of intramolecular deactivation (quenching) processes. An intermolecular deactivation is where the presence of another chemical species can accelerate the decay rate of a chemical in its excited state. In general, this process can be represented by a simple equation: : \\\\mathrm{A}^* + \\\\mathrm{Q} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{A} + \\\\mathrm{Q} or : \\\\mathrm{A}^* + \\\\mathrm{Q} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathrm{A} + \\\\mathrm{Q}^* where A is one chemical species, Q is another (known as a quencher) and * designates an excited state. The kinetics of this process follows the Stern–Volmer relationship: : \\\\frac{I_f^0}{I_f} = 1+k_q\\\\tau_0\\\\cdot[\\\\mathrm{Q}] Where I_f^0 is the intensity, or rate of fluorescence, without a quencher, I_f is the intensity, or rate of fluorescence, with a quencher, k_q is the quencher rate coefficient, \\\\tau_0 is the lifetime of the emissive excited state of A without a quencher present, and [\\\\mathrm{Q}] is the concentration of the quencher.Permyakov, Eugene A.. [Luminescent Spectroscopy of Proteins], CRC Press, 1993. For diffusion-limited quenching (i.e., quenching in which the time for quencher particles to diffuse toward and collide with excited particles is the limiting factor, and almost all such collisions are effective), the quenching rate coefficient is given by k_q = {8RT}/{3\\\\eta}, where R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature in kelvins and \\\\eta is the viscosity of the solution. This formula is derived from the Stokes–Einstein relation and is only useful in this form in the case of two spherical particles of identical radius that react every time they approach a distance R, which is equal to the sum of their two radii. The more general expression for the diffusion limited rate constant is k_q = \\\\frac{2RT}{3\\\\eta}[\\\\frac{r_b + r_a}{r_br_a}]d_{cc} Where r_a and r_b are the radii of the two molecules and d_{cc} is an approach distance at which unity reaction efficiency is expected (this is an approximation). In reality, only a fraction of the collisions with the quencher are effective at quenching, so the true quenching rate coefficient must be determined experimentally.Fluorescence lifetimes and dynamic quenching == See also == Optode, a chemical sensor that makes use of this relationship == Sources and notes == Category:Chemical kinetics ","title":"Stern–Volmer relationship"},{"id":"9090623","text":"Eric Cameron (born Leicester, UK in 1935) is a Canadian artist living in Calgary, Alberta known for his conceptual art work.

He was born in Burgh in the Marsh, near Skegness, Lincolnshire. He had his chemical training from his uncle, a druggist in Chesterfield to whom he was apprenticed at the age of 12, in 1823. He set up in business at Leamington, where he made Leamington Salts. There he met a girl and was married in 1830. Their first son was Alfred Howard Gossage, born 1830. The following year he fathered another son, Frederick Herbert Gossage (1831-1907). Around the same year of 1830, he set up partnership with Mr Farndon to form the British Alkali Works at Stoke Prior, Worcestershire. British alkali meant sodium carbonate made by the Leblanc Process. The process involved the use of coal, limestone, salt and sulphuric acid, which produced copious quantities of hydrogen chloride. The noxious gas destroyed the crops of nearby farmers. By 1836 Gossage had solved the problem with his Gossage Tower. Gossage left Stoke Prior for Birmingham in 1841, where he entered the white lead trade. In 1844 he switched locations and businesses again, becoming a copper smelter in South Wales. However, he would return to Stoke Prior in 1848. In 1850 he made his final move, to Widnes in Lancashire, where he set up a copper smelter. Vast quantities of iron pyrites (FeS) were burnt in the town. to produce sulphur compounds for the sulphuric acid vital for the Leblanc Process. Copper was a common impurity in pyrites, and he devised a way to extract from the burnt pyrites. However, as soon as the pyrites mine owners heard of his process, they adopted it themselves. Gossage ruefully observed > \\"That is the worst of telling people you can get something out of their > refuse\\" Gossage continued soda making in Widnes, patenting important new methods in 1852. His greatest commercial success was with 'silicated soap', pure soap with sodium silicate added. The corrosive water glass had to be neutralised somewhat by additives such as starch. His original patent for silicated soap was Patent BP 762/54, patented on 3 April 1854, rapidly followed with patents for the addition of other substances to the mixture. Examples are patents 826 and 908, for firming up the soap with the addition of 'wheat flour or other farinaceous substance', or 'finely divided china clay or flints'. Patent 908 also extended protection to silicated soaps made by the cold process (saponification without the addition of external heat). In 1856 provisional Patent 252, full patent 1293, was for adding extra fatty acids or salts of 'lime, magnesia, ammonia, alumina or mixtures of same. Patent 2100 of 1856 was also concerned with making the soap milder. The silicated soap could be made and sold for two pennies per pound, compared to six for normal soaps. In 1857 he introduced 'Mottled soap' which had a marbled appearance. This became a best seller, domestically and abroad. It was protected by Patent 1120 of 21 April 1857. The original blocks of soap were brown. Wm Gossage called in James Hargreaves, (1834-1915) a local consultant chemist. After many sleepless nights they eventually discovered a way to produce a whitish soap with the mottle (particles of ultra marine) distributed evenly through it, producing a soap that looked rather like a blue cheese. Other companies followed his lead- mottled soaps were widely made, by companies such as Christopher Price of Bristol. It is unclear whether they copied Gossage's ideas, or had some kind of licensing agreement. Some sources say that the Gossage company was responsible for 50% of all the UK's soap exports in the 1860s and 1870s. Gossage made soaps for India and China. For domestic sale, it made special soaps, such as kosher soaps. He retired from the business in the 1860s, leaving it to his sons Alfred and Frederick Herbert, and his astute business manager, Thomas Sutton Timmis. William Gossage died at his home in Bowdon, Cheshire on 9 April 1877, with less than £160,000 to his name. The 1881 Census reports that Alfred was then described as 'retired soap manufacturer'. Frederick Herbert became the manager of the company. He left around £720,000 in his will. ==The Gossage Soap Company== Enamel advertising sign, now in the cafe at Catalyst Science Discovery Centre After their enormous success with silicated soap, the company faced a new threat from 1884. This was William Hesketh Lever's Sunlight soap. The new Sunlight was a technical and commercial novelty. Gossage's response was to produce their own similar soap, also wrapped, branded and advertised. This was 'Magical', whose logo included a wizard, and mystical symbols, such as crescent moons. This was successful, but other competitors also entered the market, such as Crosfields of Warrington and Hazelhursts of Runcorn. In the early 1900s Lever's empire purchased Hudson's soap flake business. Hudson's soap flakes had been made under contract by Gossage's. Lever moved production to Port Sunlight. Gossages soon produced an own brand soap flake. Unfortunately, Lever claimed they were using Hudson's (now Lever's) proprietary recipes- and sued the Gossage company. The resulting lawsuit damaged Gossage's finances and reputation. In 1910-1911, they were taken over by the Bruner-Mond company, alkali makers. During the Great War (1914-18) the company produced glycerine for the war effort. In peacetime, competition resumed. Brunner-Mond sold Gossages and other soap companies to Lever, under an agreement: they would exit the soap market, and Lever would not make his own alkali, instead buying it from Brunner-Mond at preferable rates. So, by 1923, after complex negotiations, the Gossage factory became a Lever property. By 1932, Lever Bros had joined with the Margarine Union of the Netherlands to form Unilever. By that year, 'Magical', and other brands were basically slight variants of 'Sunlight'. So, rationalisation meant the closure of the Widnes plant, and concentration of soap production at Port Sunlight. The factory was demolished, save for the office buildings, which lay derelict for many years. From the 1980s they have formed the core of Catalyst Science Discovery Centre (formerly Catalyst Museum of the Chemical Industry). The waste ground near the Gossage Buildings formed the site of the Spike Island Festival of 1990. ==The Gossage Tower== Absorption (Gossage) tower at John Hutchinson's Widnes works The acid gas emitted by the Leblanc Process was a considerable nuisance. The first successful user of the process, James Muspratt in Liverpool, was forced from Everton due to complaints by neighbours. This was one reason why the early alkali makers set up in then remote spots such as Widnes, which they thought would be distant from litigious neighbours. To absorb the waste gas, an apparatus was needed. Muriatic acid gas (HCl) was known to be soluble in water, but at that time it was thought that volume was the crucial variable and no known process could deliver the enormous quantities of water thought to be necessary. In experiments at Stoke Prior, Gossage discovered that surface area, not volume, was the key to absorption. He filled an old windmill with twigs and brushwood, and ran a trickle of water over the twigs. This made for a great surface area of water, able to absorb over 90% of the noxious gas. The dissolved gas created liquid hydrochloric acid. The liquid acid was poured into the local rivers and canals, replacing the vast amounts of air pollution with vast amounts of water pollution. However, not all makers used the Gossage Tower; even Gossage himself may not have used it at his Widnes plant until all alkali makers were forced to use it by the Alkali Act of 1863. In the 1880s chlorine became a valuable resource, used in bleaching powder and other products. Inventors such as Henry Deacon and Walter Weldon devised ways to extract chlorine from the hydrochloric acid, thereby ending the water pollution problem caused by the acid. ==Sources== *A History of the Chemical Industry in Widnes, by D.W.F.Hardie, ICI General Chemicals Division, Widnes, 1950. *A Dictionary of Business Biography.

He was the only person to serve as Speaker of the House of the Republic of Texas House of Representatives and the State of Texas House of Representatives. He was a member of the Tennessee General Assembly prior to his move to Texas, and during the Civil War raised and led the 18th Texas Cavalry Regiment, which was also known by the name of \\"Darnell's Regiment.\\" ==Biography== Darnell was born on April 20, 1807 to Nannie Flewellen and Nicholas Darnell in Williamson County, Tennessee, where he was raised by his grandfather, William Flewellen. Darnell married Isabelle Cozart and the two would have seven children. At 28, he ran for the Tennessee General Assembly, but lost by 8 votes. Two years later, he won election unopposed, but resigned in 1838 to move to San Augustine, Texas. In San Augustine, Darnell was sent to the Sixth and Seventh Congresses of the Republic of Texas. In the Seventh Congress, Darnell was elected Speaker of the House on November 24, 1842. After Annexation, Darnell narrowly lost the Lieutenant Governor's race to Albert Clinton Horton. While in San Augustine, Darnell helped to organize the Masonic Lodge there and held all offices of the Grand Lodge of Texas. Darnell appears to have served in the House of Representatives of the First Texas Legislature, as he is listed as receiving one vote for Speaker in the election held to replace William Crump. There is, however, no requirement that the Speaker of the House actually be a member of the House of Representatives, and it could be that the single vote that Darnell received was due to this fact. He moved to Dallas in 1858, and was elected to the House for the Eighth (1859), and Ninth (1861) Texas Legislatures. Darnell was nominated for Speaker of the House in the Eighth Legislature on the second ballot, but was defeated by M. D. K. Taylor, 45 votes to 33. In the Ninth Legislature, Constantine W. Buckley was elected Speaker and served until he apparently resigned on December 7, 1861, at which time Darnell was elected Speaker. After traveling to Richmond, Virginia, Darnell returned with orders to raise a cavalry regiment. He resigned as Speaker (as well as from the House) to raise the 18th Texas Cavalry. After serving as Assistant Doorkeeper for the House of Representatives of the 14th Legislature (1874), Darnell was elected from Tarrant County to be a member of the House for the 15th Legislature (1876). Darnell represented Tarrant, Ellis, and Dallas counties in the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1876. He served as Doorkeeper and Assistant Doorkeeper for the 15th (1879) and 16th (1881) Legislatures. Darnell died July 16, 1885 in Fort Worth and was buried in the Masonic Cemetery in Dallas, and later re-interred in the Pioneer Cemetery. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1807 births Category:1885 deaths Category:Speakers of the Republic of Texas House of Representatives Category:Speakers of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Members of the Tennessee General Assembly Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Williamson County, Tennessee Category:People from San Augustine, Texas Category:People of Texas in the American Civil War ","title":"Nicholas Henry Darnell"},{"id":"9090810","text":"Zaza the Mystic is a fictional character that appeared in comic books published by Charlton Comics.

The Queen Anne style mansion sits on a stretch of Sycamore's Main Street that is dotted with other significant Historic District structures including, the Townsend House and the Townsend Garage. The Boynton House was designed by the same architect who designed the Ellwood House in nearby DeKalb and the David Syme House, another house in the Sycamore Historic District.Bigolin, Steve. The Sycamore Historic District: Location 3, Daily Chronicle, 5 September 2006, Retrieved January 13, 2007. ==C. O. Boynton== Charles O. Boynton was born in 1826 in Rockingham, Vermont. He came to Illinois in 1847 and opened a dry goods store in Chicago. Two years later he moved to Sycamore and opened another store, this time a general store. He began lending money in 1852 by obtaining capital from back East at lower interest rates and then lending locally at a higher rate. He did this until the early 1870s and made a significant amount of money. After lending Boynton moved on to land speculation. Boynton owned farmland in DeKalb County as well as almost 75,000 acres (300 km²) in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, and Arkansas. He held nearly 60,000 acres (240 km²) of walnut forests in Arkansas where he owned a lumber mill. ==History== The elegant porte-cochere on the home's south face.Planning for the Charles Boynton House began in 1886, by Boynton. His hand picked architect was George O. Garnsey of Chicago, who had designed a number of prominent structures in DeKalb and in Sycamore. Many of those structures are listed on the National Register either individually or as part of the Sycamore Historic District. The Queen Anne style mansion was completed by April 1887 at a cost of about $12,000. The house remained in the Boynton family for around 100 years but went through numerous changes throughout its history. In the 1940s the family converted the first floor of the home for use as a gift, antique and women's clothing shop. To add merchandise space they enclosed the porch with glass and consolidated their living quarters to the upper floor. Finally, in 1986, the home left the hands of the Boynton family as third generation Lillian Boynton put the home up for sale, asking $275,000. The home, nearby Charles O. Boynton Carriage House, and surrounding property sold for $207,000. The home's new owners set about remodeling, mostly the interior of the home. Outside they returned the porch to its 1880s appearance. The third floor had originally held a grand ballroom, said to have been even larger than that in the Ellwood House. At its height the ballroom was lavishly decorated and furnished. Even in the home's last years with Lillian Boynton the ballroom still retained its deteriorated original wallpaper and gas chandeliers. After the sale, the ballroom was gutted to make way for a new master bedroom. The tower on the mansion's southeast corner. The home hit the market for the third time in a little over 100 years in 1997. Both the home and carriage house passed hands, separately this time, due to bankruptcy proceedings. The home, at remained a single family home while the carriage house was converted for office space. On December 16, 2016, the Boynton House was damaged in a fire that originated in the home's carport. Authorities speculated that a carpenter's van owned by a hardwood flooring company that was working on the property ignited, causing an estimated $175,000 in damages. No one was harmed in the fire. ==Architecture== The facade is red brick and light colored stone. There is a diagonally placed turret in the mansion's southeast corner, rising above the rest of the house. Bays are formed in the first and second floor rooms within the tower. A prominent oriel projects from the second floor's northeast corner, opposite the tower. Many windows are detailed in stained glass including those in the oriel. The porte-cochere has been remodeled over the years and was originally intended to awe and amaze visitors to the Boynton House. The home has seen a number of changes aside from the porte-cochere. The front porch has undergone dramatic altering through the years. When Garnsey designed the building he intended the porch as an open and wooden decorative touch. By the turn of the 20th century the porch had been replaced with a brick based porch. The 1940s brought the commercial conversion of the first floor of the home and the porch was enclosed with glass to provide additional space for the business. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Sycamore Historic District Category:Houses in DeKalb County, Illinois Category:Historic district contributing properties in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in DeKalb County, Illinois Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ","title":"Charles O.

Portable appliance testing (PAT, PAT inspection or redundantly as PAT testing) is the name of a process in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is \\"in-service inspection & testing of electrical equipment\\". Testing involves a visual inspection of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested. Similar procedures exist in other countries, for example, testing of equipment according to DGUV Vorschrift 3 in Germany. ==Purpose== Health and safety regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers. Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. The European Low Voltage Directive governs the manufacture or importation of electrical appliances. Compliance to this has to be declared and indicated by the display of the CE mark on the product. The responsibility for this lies with the manufacturer or the importer and is policed by Trading Standards. Testing equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the British Standard Code of Practice and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent. The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out. ==Origin of name== Portable appliance testing is abbreviated as PAT. The correct term for the whole process is \\"In- service Inspection & Testing of Electrical Equipment\\" (as defined by IET/IEE and City and Guilds). In Australia and New Zealand, the common name for PAT is simply 'Test and Tag'. The regulatory guidelines are set out in AS/NZS3760:2010. ==UK legal obligationsAppliances=== British law (the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989) requires that all electrical systems (including electrical appliances) are maintained (so far as is reasonably practicable) to prevent danger. Private houses are not covered by this legislation, although occupiers' liability requires householders not to deliberately expose occupants or visitors to unreasonable risks. The HSE and the local authority are responsible for the policing of this legislation. ===Fixed wiring in buildings=== Guidance from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET, published under the IEE brand) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recommends that a competent person must inspect the installation regularly in any public building or a place that people work. They suggest initial intervals for combined inspection and testing that range from three months (for construction equipment) to one year, and in many cases, longer periods for re-testing (certain types of appliance in schools, hotels, offices and shops).Health and Safety Executive, Electrical safety and you Although the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 is an obligation on UK businesses, there is no obligation to undertake PAT inspection. In reality neither act nor their corresponding regulations and associated statutory instruments detail PAT inspection as an obligation, but rather impose a requirement of maintenance of safety and evidence of routine maintenance for all hand-held, portable and plug-in equipment. Today a great many private companies and other organizations do meet their legal obligations to protect their workers by an enforced PAT regime, but it is not the only route. Recent HSE publications have relaxed their tone somewhat to acknowledge this, and now point out that in many situations annual PAT is disproportionate to the risks and is often not required.Maintaining portable electric equipment in low-risk environment In 2011, the HSE reviewed its approach to portable appliance maintenance in its own offices. Thinking about the type of equipment in use, and how it was used, the HSE looked back at the results from its annual testing of portable appliances across its estate over the last five years. Using the results of the previous tests, the HSE decided that further portable appliance tests are not needed within the foreseeable future or at all for certain types of portable equipment. Also, they decided to continue to monitor any faults reported as a result of user checks and visual inspections and review its maintenance system if evidence suggests that it needs revising. Electrical equipment will continue to be maintained by a series of user checks and visual inspections by staff that have had some training. Annual portable appliance testing is not always necessary in low risk environments. You do not need to be qualified as an electrician to carry out visual inspections. Regular user checks and visual inspections can be a good method of maintaining portable electric equipment. For landlords maintaining legal requirements it is not compulsory for them to have all appliances tested, but they do need to show a \\"duty of care\\" and most letting agents recommend that a test certificate is obtained. ==Origins in UK == The earliest formal portable appliance testing and inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment was introduced in the UK in government estates. This was under the control of the Property Services Agency – prior to 1972 the Ministry of Public Building and Works. In some cases testing was conducted on a three- month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an insulation resistance tester, simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of \\"passed\\", \\"tested for electrical safety\\" and \\"do not use after...\\" labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early testing and inspection was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Electricity at Work Act 1989. ==Site and campus requirements, events and contractors== In the UK there is no legal instrument that requires a sub-contractor to ensure that all tools and equipment are PAT inspected before bringing onto a site of work. Neither is there any legal instrument which obliges the site owner to ensure third-party equipment is PAT inspected either by themselves or the equipment owner. The internal policies of many UK businesses and educational establishments make mistaken reference to PAT inspection being a legal requirement under the Electricity at Work Regulations, which is false. Having such a policy is legitimate for internal reasons, but it is not underwritten by law, it is only their interpretation. Therefore, it is not a legal requirement to have a PAT inspection sticker or certificate, the obligation is that equipment must be safe. The HSE recommend policies use phrases such as \\"Equipment that is brought onto site for an event must be in a safe condition\\" and refrain from overzealous statements such as \\"must be PAT inspected\\" which can be restrictive without improving safety. Overall it is safer if a competent person makes a visual inspection than if a layman merely observes the presence of a sticker. ==Carrying out PAT == This can be done by hiring an external company to test all the electrical products in a business (someone who has had some PAT training, either by an official qualification or by attending a health and safety course offered by some electrical health and safety companies) or it can be done in-house by a competent person. In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables. ===User checks=== Advising the user of potential danger signs can result in problems being picked up before they can result in any danger. For example, if the power cable is frayed or the plug is cracked, users need to be advised not to use the appliance and report the fault to a supervisor. This information can be put across, say by the use of a poster or in a memo. User checks are always carried out before the operation, and the results are generally not recorded unless a defect is identified. ===Formal visual inspections=== This is a process of simply inspecting the appliance, the cable and the plug for any obvious signs of damage. According to the HSE, this process can find more than 90% of faults. ===Combined inspections and PAT === At periodic intervals, the portable appliances are tested to measure that the degree of protection to ensure that it is adequate. At these intervals, a formal visual inspection is carried out and then followed by electrical testing. Note the inside of the plug should be checked unless it is moulded or there is an unbroken seal covering the screws (bad internal wiring or an unsuitable fuse would cause the item to be classed as dangerous). ==Testing== The tests an appliance is required to undergo will depend on the type of appliance, its electrical Class and subject to a risk assessment by the technician. e.g. it may not be safe to perform a leakage current test which powers up the appliance, such as a grinder, if it can not be secured to a bench; an insulation resistance test may be a safe option. ===Earth resistance test=== This test shows the resistance offered by the earthing rods with the connection leads. Various testing instruments are available for earthing resistance tests. The earthing resistance should be less than 1Ω. ===Earth continuity test=== The equipment shall have a measured resistance of the protective earth circuit, or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.1 Testing is performed using an ohmmeter or PAT tester; * Using the ohmmeter to produce a reading; * Using a PAT tester under the following conditions; ** 12V maximum, test current range 100mA to 200mA - commonly known as \\"earth continuity test\\" or \\"screen test\\" ** 12V maximum, test current 10A - commonly known as \\"routine test\\" ** 12V maximum, 1.5 times rated current of appliance or 25A, whichever is greater - commonly known as \\"type test\\" or \\"bond test\\". The choice of which of the tests to use is at the operator's discretion as there is merit in each test for given situations. Later model testers that are battery powered are limited to doing the \\"screen test\\". Older mains powered units can do all tests. The purpose of the high current test is to simulate a fault condition: if a live part contacts the earthed metalwork, the earth conductor should be able to carry sufficient current to blow the fuse and render the appliance safe, without the earth conductor itself burning out. On the other hand, some equipment (especially IT equipment) could be damaged by this test, as the earth connection is only for functional purposes and is not meant to be relied upon for safety. ===Insulation resistance test=== A leakage current test performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for Class I appliances or 1mA for Class II appliances.Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2. 3.3.2(a) Alternatively, measured insulation resistance (IRUnderstanding Insulation Resistance Testing) values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c., or at 250 V d.c.Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.2(b). General to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the metal oxide varistors (MOVs) or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs or EMI suppression. Leakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a Class II appliance; * Nominal voltage is 230 V AC. (therefore it can not be performed with a digital multimeter) Insulation resistance testing is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a Class II appliance; * Nominal voltage is 500 V DC (250 V DC may be used for equipment containing MOVs / EMI filtering) A deficiency of the insulation resistance (500 V /250 V DC) test is that the DC voltage will not activate electromagnetic switches or internal relays etc. that are common in many modern power tools, computers, TVs etc. and therefore it can only test the appliance up to that point. Appliances with these components / design should be tested using the leakage current test.  Leakage test  AS/NZS 3760:2010 section 2.3.3.2 requires a leakage test to be carried out if equipment being tested must be energised to close the circuit or operate a switching device. Leakage testing does require the item being tested to be powered up thus meaning the item will switch on and operate. ===Polarity check=== In countries where the sockets are polarised, polarity testing is a simple test that can be carried out using a polarity tester to determine whether the active and neutral of the plug end are correctly connected to the corresponding terminals at the socket end.BS 7671 wiring rulesBest Practices in Testing & Tagging of Electrical Equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2003. (Zahra & Virieux 2007) 5.8.1 Note: The earth is tested during the earth continuity test. In the UK, as per BS 7671, the phase ('Live' or 'Hot') cable should connect with right hand side terminal of the socket (if we face the socket outlet). Plugs *The order (polarity) of the pins of a three pin flat pin plug, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Neutral (light blue wire) and then Active (brown wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the plug looking at the pins.Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(a). General Cord extension sockets *The order (polarity) of the socket apertures of a three pin flat pin socket, to their connections, shall be Earth (radial pin – green/yellow wire), Active (brown wire) and then Neutral (light blue wire), in a clockwise direction, when viewed from the front of the socket looking at the apertures.Standard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Sec 2.3.3.5(b). General ===RCDs / ELCBs / Safety Switches=== There are two tests methods to be used; Press button This test requires specific test equipment RCD tester: (the TEST button referred to here is the test button on the RCD tester NOT the TEST button on the RCD itself. If the RCD is live, pressing the RCD's own TEST button should ALWAYS trip the RCD). The RCD tester should be connected with the socket, with earth terminal (must !!) and 1)select the testing range 'delta' (10 mA, 30 mA, 100 mA, 300 mA, 500 mA). 2)Select half delta range, and press TEST button - the RCD should not operate, this ensures against nuisance tripping. 3)Select delta range, and press TEST button - The RCD should operate, within ms for 50 Hz, 230 V system (as per BS 7671) Applied current This test requires specialised test equipment, knowledge and training; *A current, equal to the rated tripping current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and protective earth and the operating time measuredStandard: AS/NZS 3760:2003 In-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment Appendix D D3 with maximum trip time 40 ms for Type I and 300 ms for Type II. In addition to this, many technicians also test; *using 1/2 (half) the rated tripping current to detect nuisance tripping. *using 5 times rated tripping current, with trip times reduced accordingly, to simulate high current exposure. * under 0 degree and 180 degree phases Best Practice is to test the RCD under 1/2, 1X and 5X rated tripping current, each at both the 0 degree and 180 degree phases. ===Microwave ovens=== There are two specific extra checks mandated for microwave ovens in the United Kingdom. The first is that the device immediately ceases production of the microwave radiation when the door is opened, which checks that the safety interlock systems are functional; and the second is that any leakage when operating is less than 5 mWcm−2 which indicates that the door and casing are not distorted and any seals are intact so that there is no hazard to those in the vicinity of the equipment. A piece of calibrated equipment is required for these tests to detect and measure leakage of the 2.4 GHz microwave radiation, it is usually a hand-held device with a sensing antenna that can be scanned over the areas where the door meets the casing to find any radiation hot-spots whilst the unit is operating. As Microwave ovens are not normally designed to be operated without a load this will usually take the form of an open container containing a quantity of water which is used to absorb the energy and as it gets warmed gives an indication that a unit not previously examined by a tester is actually producing microwaves. After checking for leakage the door is required to be opened by whatever means is provided and the measurement device is not to record a level above the given limit. In some scenarios a known quantity of water is heated for a known period of time and the temperature rise over the period of operation is used to generate an indication of the effective power output of the magnetron. This can be helpful to determine whether the oven is operating at the expected power levels indicated by labelling. == Class of construction == Electrical appliance classes are differentiated by a series of IEC protection classes. The protocols for PAT Testing vary by appliance class. *Class I – Single insulated wiring, which requires an earth connection. There is no symbol for a Class I product so if a rating plate has no symbol on it then it is usually Class I. *Class II – Double insulated wiring, The earth clamp is still connected during the insulation test even though no earth on appliance. Class II is indicated by double box. *Class III – These are appliances that are supplied at a low voltage (usually called Separated Extra Low Voltage) which must be less than 50 V. These appliances are supplied with a transformer supply that is also marked. The earth lead is connected to metal parts on both Class I and Class II appliances. For \\"Class I\\" during the earth test to prove continuity between earth pin and metal parts on the appliance. For \\"Class II\\" during the insulation test to prove the insulation between active-neutral and the metal parts of the appliance. i.e. there is no leakage from mains coming into the appliance to the metal parts that are exposed. ==PAT training and qualifications== PAT testing at a workbench In the UK, there is no requirement to have a formal qualification for persons carrying out PAT Testing. The Electricity at Work regulations of 1989 simply state that where required, inspecting and testing must be carried out by a competent person, however does not mention a benchmark for competency. It has become accepted practice, however, for individuals operating as PAT Testers to hold a 2377–22 City and Guilds qualification. PAT Testers in the UK do not need to be electricians or have a background in the electrical industry. An example of a nationally recognised qualification of competence in PAT is offered by City & Guilds: 'Code of Practice for In-service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment – 4th Edition (No. 2377)'.City & Guilds 'Code of Practice for In- service Inspection and Testing of Electrical Equipment' qualification although there are others provided by EAL available. In Australia it is a legal requirement to have attended a course or gained a qualification in order to PAT. Proof of a company's competence takes the form of a course certificate or qualification. A formal examination process for the topic is operated in collaboration with EAL or city and guilds (the awarding body) under the authority of the QCA (The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) who validate and authorise the qualification. In New Zealand it is not a legal requirement to attend a training course however persons undertaking Portable Appliance Testing must be deemed Competent by a Responsible person (being the owner of the premise. electrical equipment or someone with a legal responsibility for the safety of electrical equipment). ==Types of PAT testers== PAT testing can be conducted manually, using a collection of standard test gear, including a high-voltage insulation tester and a low resistance ohm meter for earth continuity. But generally it is conducted with an automatic tester that applies a sequence of tests in turn. At the basic level, PAT test instruments carry out basic safety checks. Most are equipped with an earth continuity test, insulation resistance test and the ability to check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users. ===Pass / fail PAT testers=== These are the simple-to-use and comparatively much cheaper portable appliance testers for most businesses who will test in-house to carry out the testing and suitable for a wide range of businesses. They simply say PASS or FAIL when a test is carried out. Mains powered testers require AC power. Battery operated PAT testers are self-contained and convenient to use. They usually come with rechargeable batteries. These testers have a simple \\"lights\\" system. They have a \\"Pass\\" light, a \\"Fail\\" light, options for Class I metal / plastic or Class II. They also will show: *earth continuity *insulation resistance *polarity. ===Advanced PAT testers=== These testers display more information than just pass or fail, including: *Earth continuity resistance (aka Earth Bond) tests with a measurement range of 0 – 1.99 Ω at high test currents (usually 8 A, 10 A or 25 A) and lower test currents (in the range 20 mA to 200 mA), enabling a complete range of appliances including personal computers to be tested; *Insulation resistance tests at test voltages of 500 V DC or 250 V DC. *Protective conductor/touch current measurement (sometimes referred to as \\"earth leakage tests\\" on some older PAT units); *Fuse test; *Lead polarity. These readings require interpretation by an electrician or someone with electrical understanding. Advanced PAT testers are effective as facilities management tools because they can record the location and test status of electrical equipment and appliances. ===RCD testing=== Some units can also test Residual-current devices, following the recommendation in the current IEE Code of Practice to test any RCD fitted on an extension lead or multiway adapter. Modern PAT testers include an RCD test ===Computerised PAT testers=== Some advanced PAT testers can download information to a computer. Bluetooth enabled computerised PAT testers make the two way transfer of test data between the tester and PC-based record keeping systems much simpler, and can be used with other test accessories such as label printers. Records can be maintained using PAT software such as PATorganiser. == Calibration of testers == As PAT testers are sophisticated instruments, it is important to make sure that they are continuing to measure correctly. If a company fails to check and maintain calibration, it could face difficulty substantiating any measurements in the event of a claim. It is usually recommended that calibration is carried out annually on a PAT testing unit. When a PAT tester is calibrated, it is internally trimmed to match the original specification. This includes: *Ensuring the resistance readout is accurate and correcting for any drift arising from ageing of components inside the PAT tester, *Calibrating the unit back to national standards. This is best performed by the product manufacturer (if they offer a calibration service) or a laboratory accredited by United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS)The United Kingdom Accreditation Service *If it is mains powered, then a safety test must be carried out. *A calibration certificate should be issued to prove the PAT unit has been electrically tested. Dual purpose check boxes (which are essentially known resistances either side of the test limits) have also been introduced which are capable of validating the accuracy of both electrical installation testers and portable appliance testers in the field, reducing the risk of a tester being used when not operating correctly - this also allows the re-calibration interval to be increased. == See also == * Electrical safety testing ==References== ==External links== *HSE guidance on PAT testing *HSE Portable appliance testing FAQs *HSE Maintaining electrical equipment safety *UK Health and Safety Executive – Portable appliance testing myths debunked *IET/IEE Code of practice for in-service inspection and testing of electrical equipment *Memorandum of guidance on the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989.

The museum was founded in 1825, the first in the country. It has been on its present site in the Company's Garden since 1897. The museum houses important African zoology, palaeontology and archaeology collections. Iziko is a Xhosa word meaning \\"hearth\\". ==History== The South African Museum was founded by Lord Charles Somerset in 1825 as a general museum comprising natural history and material culture from local and other groups further afield. In time, it developed greater systematic organisation and classification similar to the evolutionary models that were prominent in European and American museums in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The focus on natural history encouraged the notion that very little divided the animal world from the human subjects who were documented. This continued until the 1990s with the reservation of cultural history museums for the display of settler histories and the relegation of material culture from other cultures to natural history and anthropology museums. \\"Bushmen\\", referring collectively to San and Khoi indigenous groups, were considered lowest on the evolutionary timescale and as living remnants of \\"civilised\\" man's prehistory, akin to the highest form of ape. As such, they became the subject of intensive research, particularly from 1906 onwards under the directorship of Louis Péringuey. Subsequent research on Bushmen was informed by the rise of physical anthropology, a discipline in the European scientific community that drew direct correlation between physical type and evolutionary status and therefore intellectual, cultural and social status, as discussed in a 1988 article by Annie Coombes. Between 1907 and 1924 Péringuey initiated a casting project, carried out by museum modeller James Drury, in which sixty- eight body casts of \\"pure Bushmen specimens\\" were taken in a process that was both humiliating and painful for the participants. The title of Drury's book, Bushman, whale and dinosaur, detailing his 40-year affiliation with the South African Museum, gives some indication of the status these specimens were given. ===Important past exhibitions and displays=== Bushman Diorama Some of the casts made by museum modeller James Drury were displayed in the South African Museum from 1911 but without any contextualisation or acknowledgement of the Bushmen's complex social and cultural networks. With accompanying museum labels in which they were continually referred to in the past tense, the Bushmen were consigned to history and extinction. It was only in the late 1950s that Drury's casts were given any contextualisation in the form of the Bushman Diorama when they were displayed in an invented cultural setting based on an early nineteenth-century painting by Samuel Daniell. However, the newly revised label once again emphasised the narrative of extinction and lacked any historical contextualisation or information about the Bushmen's individual histories. The Bushman Diorama was not the only South African Museum display that historicised ethnic groups in this way. The African culture gallery also featured a series of displays of casts or models of \\"dark-skinned people\\" (in ethnically-defined groups) who \\"live in rural areas and are located in timeless places such as 'tribes' or 'groups'\\". The Bushman Diorama deserves particular attention though, as it has been at the centre of much contestation but also a popular tourist attraction for foreigners, locals and schools. The focus of tours was largely the physical appearance of the figures; teachers and tour guides would routinely use the display to emphasise racialised physical features such as skin, hair type, body shape and genital forms. In 1989, in recognition of the ethical and unequal power dimensions involved in the display, the South African Museum took the first steps to mediate the diorama. This came in the shape of an adjoining exhibition that investigated the rationale for the casting project and explored the backgrounds and identities of the people who had been cast. Photographs from the casting process were shown and one of the figures was dressed in early twentieth century (instead of hunter-gather) attire to alert viewers to the constructed nature of the diorama. Continued revision occurred in 1993 with Out of Touch, an auto-critique that added \\"dilemma labels\\" and contrasting superimposed images to the display cases in the African cultures gallery (and the diorama) in order to destabilise the narrative and to \\"qualify previous notions of cultural stasis by acknowledging urbanisation and other changes\\". Miscast The exhibition that was most seriously aimed at a revisionist history of the diagram was also the most controversial and publicly debated. In 1996 Miscast: Negotiating the Presence of Khoi and San History and Material Culture was exhibited, not at the South African Museum, but at the neighbouring South African National Gallery in order to counterpose the ethnographic discourse that had characterised the Bushmen in such a disparaging manner. The curator, Pippa Skotnes, used installation art as a medium, which focussed on the visual elements of the exhibition and the visitors' experiences. However, installation art, which allows a great degree of freedom for the artist, also allows for more varied interpretations (and misinterpretations) from the audience. The exhibition featured Bushman material culture, thirteen resin casts of Bushmen bodies and body parts, instruments used in physical anthropology and a vinyl floor underlaid with generally derogatory newspaper articles, official documents and pictures of Bushmen from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These were contrasted with photographs on the walls of contemporary Bushman life taken between 1984 and 1995. The fact that visitors had to step on representations of Bushmen was seen as a literal \\"trampling of culture\\" and many of the visitors felt that Skotnes had reiterated the ethnographic and museological practices that she was trying to challenge. The exhibition also brought to the fore politics of identity and representation. Bushmen representatives argued that Skotnes could not speak about or for people she \\"did not understand\\" and while some consultative protocols were followed with \\"official groups that were just forming\\", the general consensus was that these were inadequate. After Miscast there have been various exhibitions at the South African Museum and South African National Gallery with a general focus on Bushmen rock art and paintings. One of the exhibitions ended with a Bushman healing ceremony that included the lighting of a sacred peace pipe and traditional song and dance. These exhibitions also utilised strategies such as quotes from Bushmen individuals and a replica cave with its interior coated by a giant photograph of a real cave to \\"allow the viewer to experience something approximating what the Bushmen might have felt originally\\" and as an answer to the deficiencies of past Bushmen displays. In April 2001, the Bushman Diorama was closed. ==Exhibitions== Asbestos pipeline with gypsum crystals.

He is currently professor and former chair of anthropology at the University of Wyoming, having previously taught at Emory University and Montana State University. In 2011 he was Fulbright Distinguished Chair in Cultural Studies at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz, Austria, and in 2007 he was a visiting professor at Shanghai University. From 1985 to 1987 he conducted fieldwork in the Heiltsuk community of Bella Bella, British Columbia. More recently he has worked with the Nuu-chah-nulth (formerly referred to as \\"Nootka\\") people of Vancouver Island, and several groups of the northern Great Plains. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of Chicago, where he studied with Raymond D. Fogelson, Nancy Munn, and Marshall Sahlins. His early monograph on the Heiltsuks employed a dialogic perspective to understand issues of power and representation of both self and other. This was influenced by Lévi-Straussian structuralism and the historical structuralism of Sahlins. In more recent works, he has pursued a range of interests, primarily in the analysis of indigenous culture in a historical context. His work on revitalization movements revisits one of the classic ethnohistorical theories. He has also contributed to the literature on ethnoecology, arguing that traditional Northwest Coast ecological models expressed via ritual and myth non-linear system dynamics. He was co-editor of the journal Ethnohistory in 2007-2013, and is now editor-in-chief of the journal Reviews in Anthropology. He is theme editor for cultural anthropology of UNESCO's Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, and he writes a column titled The World is Curved for the journal Anthropology News. He was president of the Society for Humanistic Anthropology in 2006-2008, and in 2013 was elected president of the American Society for Ethnohistory (for 2014-2015). He has edited several important books on Native Americans and the environment, revitalization movements, and Northwest Coast ethnology. He has published extensively on anthropological history and theory, especially the Boasian tradition, and the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. He was a visiting fellow in Lévi-Strauss' laboratory in 1997. He was the 2016 William Evans chair at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. ==Bibliography== * Harkin, Michael E.

The character was portrayed by Shiri Appleby. In the CW reboot, Liz is of Mexican descent therefore having the surname Ortecho (like in the original books that preceded both TV series) and is played by Jeanine Mason. In the series her name is Liz Ortecho Liz is considered to be the protagonist of the series, along with Max Evans. Liz is the main narrator throughout the three seasons and she has been described as the \\"heart and soul\\" of the show. She made her first appearance in the Roswell pilot episode and remained a core character until the series finale.Liz Parker credits IMDB.com ==Fictional character summary== *Note: This article is about Liz Parker as the television character of Roswell only. Although the two versions are similar the character of the original books is considered an alternative universe version. Liz Parker attends Roswell High School, where her favorite subject is science. Her best friends are Alex Whitman and Maria DeLuca. At the beginning of the series, she breaks up with boyfriend Kyle Valenti and engages in a relationship with alien-human hybrid Max Evans, which serves as the crux of the television series. ===Characteristics=== Liz Parker is portrayed as a typical girl next door, at least from the outside. She is beautiful though she doesn't really realize it. She is smart and very direct about her opinions, sensible, confident and levelheaded. Her home was above the diner her family owns, the Crashdown Café, and until the last episode, she worked there as a waitress after school. She did well in school, especially in science that had been her passion since she was a child. Her dream was to go into molecular biology at Harvard university. However, after the events in the season three finale, Liz's whereabouts are unknown. Liz is a complex character; very sweet and kind overall, yet strong and determined. Control is something very important for her: with it, she can get facts and answers and this makes her feel more safe about herself, those she loves, and life in general. However, her real nature isn't really so controlled. When Max saves her life and she falls in love with him, everything in her life changes; Max is the living proof that people cannot control everything and even science doesn't have all the answers. She understands this, and realizes that she has to follow her heart and live in the moment, because no matter how people try, they can't control everything and they can't choose with whom they fall in love. However, in the second season Liz becomes a character who is prone to extreme illogical behavior, often engaging in unreasonable accusatory behavior and mixed messages to others in the Roswell group. The second season is perhaps the worst for Liz as a character, and many audiences find the season 2 Liz far behind the sweet girl of the first season and the confident and free Liz of season 3. Liz emerges as the \\"brain\\" among the group. She is the one who continuously gets the very core point of their problems and is able to find a solution most of the time - especially if the problem is science related. However, her determination and selfless spirit mixed with her sometimes controlling nature can also be a character flaw when it leads her into making decisions where she takes too much of the responsibility. This is also a characteristic that she shares with Max Evans. It is stated that she loves White Roses in the season 2 episode, End of the World. ===Relationship with Max Evans=== The important premise and core plot of the show is Liz's relationship with the character Max Evans. The Co-executive producer of the series Ronald D. Moore, along with Jason Katims, stated more than once that Max and Liz represented the heart and soul of the series.Ronald D. Moore, co- executive producer, October 8, 2000, Q&A; Crashdown.com Max has been in love with Liz since the first time he saw her at school, when he was just eight years old (shortly after emerging from the pod). However, he kept himself distanced from her, primarily because of his concerns about being an alien and her being a human, so Liz did not know about his feelings and did not suspect that her laboratory partner had been secretly in love with her. This secret ends only in the pilot episode when she gets shot at the Crashdown Cafe and he saves her life, risking everything for her and starting the lead plot of the show. Liz does love Max from the first time she gets the chance to see his soul and to really know him. This happens when Max does give her the chance to connect with him through a reversed connection created by his alien powers in order to make them even since the same happened when he healed her and he got flashes from her about her life and her inner feelings. In that moment, Liz can see his thoughts, especially about her, and she realizes that he's lonely, he loves her and he does not want to hurt people, so she starts to help him and his friends, from the beginning making the decision to renounce her normality. She shares a deep, mysterious connection with him. It is with her involuntary help that he starts to find more clues about his origins. Also, Liz is able to feel whether Max is in danger or hurt (in the third season she feels when he dies), and they save each other's lives more than once. For this powerful connection between them and their deep and natural affinity and compatibility, they are considered soulmates by both the characters of the story and the creators of the series. Recurring Themes Due to the nature of their relationship and the obvious difference between an alien boy and a human girl, Max and Liz's relationship is another modern example of forbidden lovers, with many references to Romeo and Juliet through the series by both the characters and the writers. Most notable examples are when Maria De Luca called them \\"Romeo and Juliet against the world\\",Maria DeLuca in the episode \\"Control\\", season three or when Liz herself used the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet into her own tragic speech in the episode \\"The End of the World\\" from season two. The producers and writers of the series were not unaware of the parallelism either. ===Effect of Max's powers on Liz=== After Max Evans heals her in the pilot, he converts her to the alien side and she changes. At the end of the show, she is still human, but has developed some alien powers. In the episode \\"Four Aliens and A Baby\\", Liz blasts Tess Harding twice, using a green energy that exited from her hands. In \\"Graduation\\", she starts to see flashes about the future after touching people. She sees a customer of the Crashdown Café in danger and she and Max save her. While she is making out with Max she gets a flash of Max, herself, Michael and Isabel being killed by someone. Thanks to this power, they flee Roswell at the end of the series, before the FBI can kill them. In the season two episode \\"Max in the City\\", viewers can see her \\"change\\" start to develop when she saves Max's life by projecting her image from Roswell to New York with Isabel's help. ==Fictional biographySeason One=== In the pilot, while Liz is working at her parents' restaurant, Crashdown Cafe, she is shot accidentally by two men who are having an argument. When Max saves her life by healing her gunshot wound, her life is changed forever. He puts his hand over her wound and miraculously makes the wound and bullet disappear. Realizing that there is something incredibly amazing about Max, she decides to investigate. She takes Max's pencil, which Max had been chewing on, places the saliva collected from the pencil tip on a slide, and examines the slide through a microscope. She can see that his cells are not human. When she confronts Max about everything that had happened to her and his alien cells, Max confesses to her that he is an alien that had been on the alien craft that crashed in Roswell in 1947. With growing suspicion coming from the local sheriff, Jim Valenti, Liz devises a plan to throw him off Max's scent. She is successful and Valenti, though still cautious and wary of Max, lets him go. After this incident, she starts developing deep feelings for Max, despite her current relationship with the sheriff's son Kyle Valenti. For a while she lies to her friends Alex and Maria, but eventually Maria confronts Liz about what is going on. Liz eventually relents to Maria's questions and tells her all she knows about Max, Isabel and Michael. Kyle grows jealous of the growing relationship between her and Max, and a group of his friends beat up Max. She breaks up with Kyle in response to this, causing a rift between them. However, her relationship with Max grows very strong and she finds herself falling in love with him. An incident involving Michael Guerin, however, scares Max away, and he realizes that doesn't want to hurt Liz in any way. He is an alien and doesn't know what is going to happen to him or who might come after him; he wants her to be safe. However, Liz and Max end up falling in love. Max, as an alien, had a profound effect on her, and when they kiss Liz gets images of Max's past, which help Max, Michael and Isabel discover an Alien Orb. This doesn't last long, as Tess Harding arrives in Roswell and begins to influence Max in a strange way. Liz sees Max and Tess kiss and is heartbroken, but after hearing Max out she and the others start to believe that Tess could be the fourth alien named Nasedo using a female appearance and she's influencing Max's thoughts by making him hallucinate. She forgives him and with her help the group discovers that Tess is not Nasedo but another hybrid like Max, Michael and Isabel and her unique power is to create mindwarps. Feeling that Liz is a threat to his plans, the real Nasedo shapeshifts into Max and takes her. When she kisses him, she realizes he is not Max because she has visions of his past. Max, worried about Liz and what Nasedo might do, goes after them. Maria and Alex tell Sheriff Valenti that they are worried because Liz is with Max and she called claiming that she was scared because Max was acting weird. This was done in order to try to find Liz faster. They are found in a theme park. In the house of mirrors, Max is grabbed by the FBI and Nasedo grabs Liz. She kisses him and again realizes that he is Nasedo when she gets images from his past. She is deeply heartbroken when Max is abducted by the FBI and has to tell the news to Michael and Isabel. With the help of Nasedo, the gang saves Max from the FBI. In the season one finale, \\"Destiny\\", she goes with Max to the alien pod chamber in the rock formation that was disguised as the alien craft that crashed. Max, Michael, Isabel and Tess' destiny is revealed when they use the alien orbs to contact Max and Isabel's (alien) mother. Max, Michael, Isabel and Tess are the Royal Four of their home planet Antar. They were all killed in their former lives by their enemy Kivar. During their deaths, their alien DNA was mixed with human DNA and sent to earth so their race could preserve the Royal Four in order for them to return someday to rule again. In their former lives, Max was Zan, the king of Antar. Tess (Ava in a former life) was Zan's wife, Isabel (Vilandra) was Zan's sister and her husband was Michael (Rath), Zan's second in command. After realizing that Max and Tess are destined to be together and the importance of Max to his race, Liz decides to let Max go in order for him to fulfill his destiny, because she now sees he is destined to be with Tess, no matter how much they love each other. As she leaves the cave, Max follows her but Michael stops him, saying, \\"You have to let her go\\". ===Season Two=== Season two begins with Liz returning from a summer away from Roswell. She has a new job as an intern for Congresswoman Whitaker, who later turns out to be a Skin, an enemy of the hybrids. While Liz continues to have strong feelings for Max, she stands by her decision that their relationship stands in the way of his destiny. Max, on the other hand, tries everything he can to be with her., In the episode \\"The End of the World\\", Liz is asked by a future version of Max to help him get the modern-day Max to fall out of love with her. Future Max claims that if they don't do this, the world will end and they will all die. Shocked, she only accepts it when Future Max predicts that Max will turn up with a Mariachi band and sing a love song for her. When this transpires she agrees to help Future Max. He goes on to tell her the kind of future present-day Max and she will have if they do not succeed. He tells her that after she and Max made love for the first time, it cemented their relationship and they were never apart again. This upset Tess and she left Roswell. Max and Liz were married in Las Vegas when they were 19 and were together until the end of the world came because when Max's enemies came to earth, Max, Michael, and Isabel were not strong enough in their powers without Tess. So they have to get Tess and Max together to save everyone and rewrite the future. She tries to get Tess to help by attracting Max towards her but it fails when Max catches Liz watching. Liz at the end has to resort to making Max think that she slept with Kyle. This succeeds; as Max walks to the window, he sees Liz talking with Kyle in bed, which breaks Max's heart. Liz has one last dance to her future wedding song, \\"I Shall Believe\\" by Sheryl Crow, with the Future Max, but he disappears because the future has been changed and he no longer exists. Liz attracts the attention of Maria's cousin, and they have a few dates, but nothing serious comes out of it., She is left devastated when she hears that Alex has died in a car crash. She visits the destroyed car that Alex was driving and finds a picture of Alex and a girl he met in Sweden, but his head was cut off in the picture. This leads her to suspect that Alex was murdered, and she begins to try to find the supposed truth by asking the last person who saw him what Alex had said to him. At the funeral gathering in Alex's home, she accuses an alien of killing Alex. This deeply offends Max and the others, more so Isabel who had grown close to Alex. This creates a \\"them vs. us\\" scenario and the whole future of the formerly tight group looks bleak. She decides to go to Sweden to find the people with whom Alex was staying, but she receives a call from the Swedish government claiming that the building Alex was standing in front of in the photo, supposedly taken in Sweden, hasn't existed in several years. She comes to the conclusion that Alex never went to Sweden. Her investigations lead her, Maria, and Michael to Las Cruses University. They discover that Alex had been working there on a translation program for the alien book that was given to Max and the others. Liz sees the girl with Alex in the photo at a Nelly Furtado concert but loses her in the crowd. Liz returns to Roswell, and she finds out that Tess is pregnant with Max's child, and that he has to leave Earth and go back to Antar. He has to do this because the baby is dying, as he can't survive in the Earth's environment. Max also asks her about the girl at Las Cruses. Wanting to know why he is asking, she learns that Max suspects the girl to be an alien and that he has to kill her to stop her from being a threat. She asks whether she could go with him to witness it, and he agrees, but as Max was about to commit the act, Liz realizes that the girl is human; she saves the girl from the fire that Max has caused. They head home confused because they do not know who killed Alex and it now looks like they will never know. Max tells Liz and that he has to go back to Antar with Tess, Isabel and Michael because the baby is dying. Liz is heartbroken and angry at the same time at the thought that Max is leaving her. Max discovers the truth about Kyle when he asks Liz if she really slept with Kyle and she tells him no. Upon realizing this he sees the huge mistake he has made with Tess. He wishes he could go back because he has always loved Liz, despite being with Tess. Liz asks him if he loves Tess and Max says, \\"Not like I love you\\". What he felt for Tess was only care. He wants things to be different, but he feels that his duty is to his son, and thus has no other choice than to save him. Max and Liz share a passionate kiss. When Liz doesn't have a vision, Max breaks down in tears. He realizes that their futures did not intersect. If he goes with his son, he will never see her again. Liz goes to Maria's cousin, Sean, and declares that Max has broken her heart, but she realizes that it isn't Sean's fault and she can't use him as Max's replacement. During the day the aliens have planned to leave, Liz, Maria, Sean and Kyle are at the Crashdown Café talking. Maria and Liz notice that Kyle keeps tapping the table in a peculiar sort of way. When they mentioned this, he says that he has no control over it and doesn't even know he's doing it. They go to Maria's house and find her mom remembering about a hostage situation in which they had been. Tess uses an alien power to blank her memory. They confront Maria's mother and she appears fine and seems to forget again. But she then starts to tap the same way that Kyle had done earlier in the day. Liz remembers that Alex used to tap his bass guitar the same way, and she realizes that this isn't a coincidence. They confront Kyle and tell him to look around the room to see whether anything will jerk his memory. When he looks in the mirror, he remembers that Tess killed Alex and that he had been mindwarped by Tess to carry Alex's dead body to the car. Liz and Maria go to the pod chamber just as Max, Michael, Isabel and Tess are about to leave the planet with the granolith. At the last minute, Michael decides he cannot leave Earth because this is his home and he is in love with Maria and can't leave her. As Michael leaves the pod chamber, the door opens and Liz and Maria tell Michael that Tess killed Alex. Max confronts Tess and realizes that it was all a setup and that the baby was a part of the plan. Kivar wasn't Tess and Nasedo's enemy. The truth is that 40 years before, Nasedo had made a deal with Kivar: go home to Antar, delivering Max and his friends to him (that would have killed them) and carry Max's heir in the process. Angry, Max wants to kill her but then realizes that she is carrying his son so he lets her go in order to save the baby. He regroups with Liz and the others on the mountainside. Max then tells Liz that he was wrong about many things but not about her, that he loves her, and will always love her. They embrace and the season ends with Max saying that he must save his son. ===Season Three=== At the start of season three, viewers can only see flashes of some moments of the summer when Liz and Max reconcile in order to understand what happened after departure and what brought them to \\"busted\\" and then together again. They arrange to go out on a date, a way to start things over from the beginning. They are on their date when Max decides to go skinny dipping. As Liz is about to join him, Max gets a vision from his son and begins to drown. Liz saves him. Max realizes that his son is in trouble. They search for a ship that they believe is held in a storage facility in the basement of a convenience store in Utah. Liz and Max come up with a plan to hold up the store and when Liz is holding the shop clerk hostage, Max will go down and check to see whether the ship is there. Max gives Liz a gun and when they hold up the convenience store, Max finds that there is a ship and it is still working, but his time is cut short as the police arrive. They try to escape, but they fail. They are caught after a police chase, and both are arrested and held in the local jail. Max is let out after the police find that nothing was taken from the shop. They couldn't find the weapon, but due to a witness seeing Liz with the gun, Liz is kept in jail. She gets saved by Max, as he is able to bribe the FBI into pulling some strings and getting the case dropped. However, Liz's panic-stricken father forbids her to see Max, and bans Max from coming into the Crashdown Café. She defiantly breaks the rule, and upsets her father on numerous occasions. The reason that her father bans Max is that her father was a wild teenager, and his high school sweetheart died in a car crash because of his drunk driving. Realizing this after her mother tells her, Liz's attitude towards him changes and they begin to reconcile their differences. Even if Tess' fiasco still did hurt her, Liz takes responsibility for her own mistakes and realizes it wasn't only Max's fault things went that way. She and Max love each other and they don't want to give up on their love no matter what. She understands that Max does need her so she stands by him trying to help him, putting herself in danger, finding and saving a baby. Thinking about Max's serious problem, she hides her inner feelings for most of the season, giving him her support, but then she begins to suffer some side effects towards Max's touch. Whenever Max touches her, a spark appears on her body and causes her pain. This scares her, as she realizes that when Max healed her in the pilot episode, saving her life, he changed her and they don't know whether she is safe or not. Max is scared for her; he wants to contact the FBI, the same people who tortured him in the end of season one, in order to find a way to keep her safe and know what is happening to her. He realizes that what happened with Tess is still hurting Liz and they need to talk about it. But Liz realizes that she needs a little time alone away from Roswell and Max in order to find her balance again and give their love another chance. She decides that she wants to leave Roswell temporarily, so that she can get better and understand what is happening to her, not only the alien aspect but the confusion about her life. Max respects her decision, waiting for her in Roswell. She goes to an all-girl boarding school to start fresh. It is not long before Liz's life in Roswell catches up with her. While sleeping she suddenly wakes up realizing that Max has died. She is heartbroken and decides to drown her sorrows with alcohol. While drunk she sees Max (whose body has been taken over by an old millionaire named Clayton who wanted to kill her because Max's soul was still alive in him only for her and his memories about her that Clayton got), she tells Maria who doesn't believe her. But they are both in shock when Max (when his body was still taken over by the old millionaire) comes to kill Liz as she is all he thinks about. They are both falling from the top of a building when Max regains control and he saves Liz's life by putting a force field in her path to break her fall. But, realizing that Clayton would kill her, he doesn't let himself hit the ground; he sacrifices his life for her. When Liz wakes up she realizes that Max has died; there is no heartbeat and no breath from him, so she kisses him with a desperate goodbye. Believing Max to be still dead, Liz is shocked as he wakes up and appears to come back to life. They realize that Liz has saved Max's life making him come back with a kiss. Back in Roswell, Max and Liz are shocked when Tess appears with Max's baby. Tess had to return because Kivar betrayed her, trying to kill the baby because he was fully human, as it was the human parts of Max and Tess that made him. Max discovers that the baby is fine and his sickness was another lie. The baby wasn't sick on Earth, this was just another mindwarp by Tess in order to force Max's return to Antar. She had crash-landed on Earth and slaughtered everyone around her ship at the air base. Tess and her son are now being hunted by the Army. Max and the others start a vote in order to decide whether they should deliver Tess to the FBI because it was her fault they were suddenly all in danger again. In the end, Liz's final vote is no because she never wants to be a killer like Tess and she can't deliver her to the FBI—that would have done to Tess what they did to Max in the end of season one. In the night, Tess realizes that the only way to save her son is to destroy the base with all the proof and kill herself in the process. Amazed at how Liz didn't vote against her, Tess asks for Liz's help, trusting only her in the group. She understands her mistakes and she tells Liz that Max always loved only her and all the times that she and Max were together she always got flashes of Liz in his mind. Liz appreciates her sincerity and Tess asks Liz to not let the FBI study her like a laboratory animal. After Tess' death, Max decides to give up his child for adoption so he can have a safe, normal life. The decision destroys Max's heart, but Liz comforts and supports him, letting him cry in her arms. Later Liz realizes that she now has a power: to see the future. When she touches Max she has visions that she, Max, Isabel, and Michael are going to die. Michael says that Max, Liz and Isabel should leave Roswell separately because the FBI knows who they are and their life in Roswell has to be over. Maria is upset by this because she doesn't want to be left in Roswell alone without Michael or Liz. Max proposes to Liz, making the choice to be with her even if they have only 12 days. Liz says yes. They all attend their graduation and when they realize this is where they are supposed to die from one of Liz's flashes they all escape into the desert. Now Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel and Kyle decide to leave together because even though Maria and Kyle were not going to be killed, Kyle wants to be with his own kind when he develops his alien powers from Max's healing and Maria wants to be with Michael. They leave Roswell that night, and go together in a van, deciding to live life using their powers to do good deeds on the road. Liz sends her father her journal, continuing the truth about everything so he can understand why she left and finally know what has been going on in her life. Liz marries Max in a beautiful country church. ==Shiri Appleby about her character== During the time when the show aired, Shiri Appleby was interviewed many times about her character The actress originally auditioned for all the three female roles in the show (Liz, Maria, Isabel) before finally landing the part of teen heroine Liz Parker.
